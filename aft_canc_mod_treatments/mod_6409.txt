In the MICU pain control was achieved with PCA and oral morphine.
He was transiently on an beta blockade for control of BP and HR and titrated off by the afternoon of POD1.
When stable he was transferred to 12 Riesman, on POD5 a decrease in his O2 saturation was noted and a chest radiographs were suggestive of bilateral pneumonia, sputum and blood cultures were collected and found to be negative.
He was again transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management of developing hypoxia and treatment of pneumonia.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn, his 02 saturation gradually improved and he was transferred back to 12 [**Hospital Ward Name 1827**].
The cause was most likely multifactorial and includes insensible loss from NG tube, low fluid resusitation rates due to a history of emphysema and bleomycin toxicity and Vancomycin toxicity.
Renal and pulmonary services were consulted, all nephrotoxic medications were stopped or dosed renally, he was hydrated with increase in per hour rate and boluses of NS, a Vancomycin trough was checked and found to be elevated.
The Vancomycin was not restarted the Zocyn was discontinued after 8 days.
He was transitioned to oral Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl both renally dosed in preparation for discharge.
He was discharged to home POD15, in stable condition, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating independently, pain controlled with a combination of narcotics and neuropathic medications.
