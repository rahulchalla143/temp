WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2169-1-14**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
Follow-up radiographs are recommended following treatment in order to ensure resolution.
Ground-glass and more confluent opacities throughout the right lower lobe, consistent with an infectious process.
Since the prior study, esophageal stent has been placed, and the patient has been intubated, with tip of endotracheal tube terminating at the level of the medial clavicles, about 7.7 cm above the carina.
EGD with Stent [**2169-1-9**]: There was an extensive ulcerated mass from 29 cm to 41 cm from the incisors.
A biliary guidewire was placed and the scope was withdrawn.
Under the fluoroscopic guidance, a 15cm by 18mm UltraFlex partially covered metal stent was placed successfully over the wire.
Esophagram [**2169-1-10**]: CONCLUSION: Esophageal stent in place and there was no evidence for contrast extravasation or fistula to the bronchial tree.
Again, because of the esophageal perforation, involvement with infection/inflammation can not be ruled out.
3) Right paratracheal lymph node with minimal FDG uptake may be reactive.
CT GUIDED PEG PLACEMENT [**2169-1-20**]: IMPRESSION: Successful uncomplicated insertion of a 12 French Wills-Ogles by G-tube under CT guidance.
Interval placement of an esophageal stent with large amount of secretions within its lumen.

Patient made NPO and transferred to MICU [**Location (un) **]/[**Hospital Ward Name 517**] for a rigid and flexible bronchoscopy by IP with therapeutic aspiration of tracheobronchial secretions and diagnostic upper GI endoscopy without identification of fistula.
Pt had initially been on vanc/zosyn in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and was narrowed to unasyn in MICU [**Location (un) 2452**].
While in MICU [**Location (un) 2452**], microbiology notified team that abscess was growing thin branching gram + rods concerning for norcardia.
ID was consulted who recommended continuing unasyn and adding high-dose bactrim for nocardia coverage.
A 15cm by 18mm UltraFlex partially covered metal stent was placed successfully over the wire and barium esophogram showed showed patency of the stent.
Patient was started on a PPI.
On Day 10 of Unasyn the patient developed a diffuse morbilliform rash covering the torso and back, non-pruritic, non-painful and most c/w with a drug reaction.
He was initially placed on Levofloxacin and CTX.
Patient was temporarily on pressors during EGD given sedation and paralysis, but quickly weaned off after procedure.
Thoracics surgery was consulted, who recommended no acute surgery and to consult IP and ERCP.
IP was consulted, and recommended rigid bronchoscopy.
ID was consulted and recommended empiric IV Bactrim until further data was obtained.
Culture from abscess revealing thin branching G+ rods and G+ cocci in pairs and chains, no nocardia.
Bactrim was stopped, unasyn continued.
After ERCP, patient was still intubated so prior to extubation, patient underwent repeat bronch with mucous pluggings removed.
Patient transferred to OMED on 2L NC satting in the mid-90s.
Unasyn was stopped and patient was transitioned to Clindamycin.
In addition to this patient had his Quantiferon gold checked prior to starting his chemo treatment which was positive.
With fluid resuscitation his creatinine normalized.
He had an initial Hct drop, though thought in part to be dilutional given volume rescuscitation.
He started his chemo treatment on Monday [**1-21**].
In anticipation of [**Month/Year (2) 74384**] induced esophagitis, and poor tolerance to chemo treatment, patient had a CT guided PEG tube placed by IR on [**1-19**].
Nutrition was consulted and patient was started on nepro TFs boluses.
He will continue his rad treatment as an outpatient.
Unasysn can cause increased uric acid levels, but again, patient has had this problem for several months.
- XRAY [**1-16**] no acute fracture - defer on arthrocentesis given no obvious collection to tap, will clinically monitor - tylenol and oxycodone PRN for pain - uric acid wnl .
- Isoniazid 300mg QD started [**1-20**], will need 9 months until [**2169-10-21**].
- Monitor LFT's  To recap, The patient was transferred to the MICU for rigid bronch on [**1-8**] for evaluation of a lung abscess and was started on IV clindamycin, and back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for esophageal stent [**1-9**] for an esophageal fistula, and then transferred to the OMED service for further oncologic workup and therapy.
The patient had a G tube placed on [**1-20**] by IR.
The patient was noted to be anemic Hb 7 so he was transfused 2 units PRBC's on [**1-18**] prior to rad treatment to increase sensitivity of treatment with appropriate response Hb 7->9.
The patient received cisplatin on [**1-23**] and 5-FU from [**Date range (1) 91766**].
The patient was switched from IV clindamycin to PO clindamycin on [**2-1**].
Treatment for the PE was started on [**1-31**] with a lovenox bridge for coumadin.
He was pancultured and Rheumatology was consulted.
After a joint tap of his knee and fluid analysis, WBC was found to be 180k w/ 93% polys and negatively birefringement crystals c/w gout were seen.
The patient was started on indomethacin and vancomycin was added.
The patient also received oxycodone for pain.
Rheumatology was alright with stopping the vancomycin since no organisms grew from the joint fluid, and it was likely only a gout flare.
The patient was restarted on coumadin 2.5mg daily on [**2-4**] and [**2-5**] with a d/c INR of 2.4.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] therapy will continue during weekdays until early [**Month (only) 958**] (28 days total).
He will be scheduled for his second cycle of chemotherapy in two weeks.
He will continue his clindamycin indefinitely until Infectious Disease instructs him otherwise.
He should continue coumadin for at least 6 months with a goal INR of [**1-27**].
He will continue getting bolus tube feeds at home and remain on a full liquid diet.
Extensive instructions were given to the patient both verbally and written, but it is difficult to know how compliant the patient and his son-in-law will be with medications and attending followup appointments.
