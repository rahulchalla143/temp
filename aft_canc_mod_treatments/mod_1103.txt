Pt's fever curve improved with vancomycin, cefepime and azithromycin for a 10 day course (through [**2167-8-6**]).
Pt's dry cough did not improve with cough syrup, tessalon perles and nebulizer treatments and thus had an ENT consult which found mild irritation of vocal cords most likely related to acid reflux or viral infection.
Laryngoscopy did not show vocal cord paralysis and structurally normal.
He was started on prednisone 40 mg PO daily for a 4 day total course to end on [**2167-8-2**].
Pt was rate controlled with metoprolol 50mg TID and was successfully converted to NS rhythm.
Aspirin was held due to thrombocytopenia.
Metoprolol was discontinued given his reactive airways and wheezing.
When his pulmonary symptoms resolve, metoprolol should be considered if his tachycardia/afib persists at rehab.
