He was noted to be hypoxic and placed on NRB satting 94%, HR 160s increased from baseline 120s.
Patient was given IVF and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Past Medical History: # Large B cell lymphoma, s/p sibling-matched allogenic SCT in [**6-/2167**] - c/b severe GVHD of skin, GI/mouth - had been receiving photopheresis - TPN dependent (via PICC) # Migraines # h/o vaso-vagal syncope with blood draws # h/o bacteremia # Steroid myopathy # Moraxella sinusitis # Cardiomyopathy - TTE [**4-5**] EF 45-50% - Likely multifactorial: chemotherapy, radiation, GVHD, tachycardia # Fungemia with [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**] ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: The patient was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in  [**9-/2165**] and treated with eight cycles of R-CHOP and 25 doses of  XRT, finished in 6/[**2165**].
He received one cycle of ICE chemotherapy on [**2166-8-11**], underwent autologous stem cell transplant and was discharged [**2166-11-11**].
Liver biopsy demonstrated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and he was treated with three weekly doses of Rituxan but continued to progress.
He was treated with salvage therapy with one cycle of MINE chemotherapy as an inpatient starting [**2167-4-23**] and CT scan demonstrated response in the lung and liver with stable disease in the spleen.
The patient was admitted for a second cycle of MINE chemotherapy on [**2167-6-4**].
He received a nonmyeloablative sibling-matched allogeneic SCT in 8/[**2166**].
GJ tube in expected location.
If there is continued concern for intracranial abnormalities, MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] can be considered given the hisotry of NHL.
Brief Hospital Course: 33yo M with large B-cell lymphoma s/p allogeneic stem cell transplant '[**66**], complicated by severe chronic Graft vs.
Host Disease of the skin (scleroderma-like) and oral mucosa (now resolved).
Prior to this admission pt was recently admitted ([**4-8**] - [**4-20**]) due to pneumosepsis and tx with ceftriaxone.
He was admitted with a non-rebreather to keep 02 sats in 90s, but eventually went into respiratory failure, and intubated likely due to worsening hypoxia [**12-30**] pulm edema.
Before knowing the final BAL results pt was treated empirically with Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro, then reduced to Cefepime 2 g IV.
Other issued in the ICU included tachycardia, for which he was continued on IV Metoprolol and Hypogammaglobulinema for which he received IVIG on [**5-25**].
Pt also had pain with swollowing, and switched to IV meds, and could not tolerate his Gleevac.
Pt was weaned was off the vent and extubated [**5-26**].
Pt required frequent suctioning but stabalized and came to the floor on [**5-28**].
Our team thought it may have been due to fluconazole and was changed to Caspo.
Pt also has an elevated LDH - differential: wbc/rbc hemolysis vs PCP (but pt gets daily atorvoquone as prophylaxsis), and all appear unlikely - unknown why pt has elevated LDH, but may be related to above issue.
The latest CT chest on [**6-27**] showed "Marked improvement in bibasilar consolidation, with mild residual RLL abnormality with impacted bronchi and peribronchial infiltration.
His GVH is causing (1) scleroderma-like, leathery, thickening of skin on his entire body leading to immobility and pain with movement from his tense skin, and (2) GI effects - pt originally had severe oral ulcerations now resolved, but currently continues to have aphagia and dysmotility.
Pt has not been able to take food by mouth for 1 year, and has been TPN dependent for 1yr.
He had always been able swallow pills by mouth, but this changed during over the course of this admission, and is currently unable even take pills by mouth - therefore completely NPO.
Pt always preferred to be fed by GI tract, and we needed a route to give meds that do not have IV formulations (especially Gleevac).
So pt had a PEG placed by IR on [**6-13**].
Pt had mild improvement with lidocaine patch, but the pain was severe and started on Morphine PCA, and as this was becoming an unresolving pain Pain Service recommended transitioning to methadone.
On [**6-23**] the site was cultured showing only skin flora (4+ G+C in pairs, chains, and clusters).
There was no change and on [**6-28**] swab was repeated again showing skin flora, but continued to have purulent discharge and mild erythema around site.
GI was reconsulted and the attending agreed with us that the PEG is infected, and recommended that we treat with antibiotics before removing the PEG.
Pt was started on Zosyn/Vanco for this PEG infection, and in [**11-29**] days pt's purulent discharge and erythema resolved along with near resolution of pt's abdominal pain at the site.
We are now trying to taper down pt's morphine PCA, and transitioning to methadone elixir and tylenol 1000mg QID per PEG, and once off PCA, at that point will add oxycodone elixir for breakthrouh pain.
Pt's gastroparesis was so severe that tube feeds were stopped.
Pt was restarted on TF and is currently tolerating 5-10cc/hr.
The first two days Gleevac (liquid mixture) was pushed the pt vomitted (but it was thought that since the pt was always lying down it was the gastric residuals were regirgitated and not jejunal tube feeds (and hopefully most of the Gleevac was retained).
Goal is to decrease narcotic requirement as much as possible to help with GI motility.
Pt was already anti-coagulated with Fondaparinox for a PE in [**2-3**] (attributed cause of his persistent tachycardia).
On [**7-25**] he received ~10mg IV Dilaudid during the day for pain control and at 1143 PM he got 1mg of IV ativan.
Patient became tachypneic and with agonal breaths.
He got placed on CPAP and was transfered to the ICU.
Patient required high-dose fentanyl and midazolam as sedation.
Patient was found to have a small consolidate on CXR and was started on Vancomycin for s. aureus pneumonia.
Extubation was tried in multiple times putting patient on pressure support.
He repeatedly retained CO2 to levels similar to intubation, despite [**Last Name (un) 10737**] in very low dose of fentanyl for pain control.
Morphine was tried without any relief.
Patient was explained the risk and benefits of receiving lorazepan (half a dose than before) and wanted his anxiety treated though risks included potential respiratory failure and death.
