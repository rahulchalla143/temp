Admission Date:  [**2112-2-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2112-2-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2040-6-19**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 212**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71 year-old male with a history of end stage renal disease on hemodialysis and a history of gastrointestinal bleed, recent myocardial infarction and hypotension.
The patient went to the Emergency Department with chest pain and received po and intravenous vitamin K, fresh frozen platelets and INR dropped to 1.0.
The patient was given 2 units of packed red blood cells.
The patient had vague intermittent chest pain throughout admission to the outside hospital for which he received morphine and sublingual nitroglycerin.
The patient was in normal sinus rhythm on Coumadin after discharge.
Coumadin 3 mg h.s.
Prevacid 30 mg q day.
Atenolol 50 mg q day.
Amiodarone 200 mg q day.
Isosorbide 20 mg t.i.d.
99% saturation on 2 liters nasal cannula as well as on room air.
IMPRESSION:  Our impression was that this is a 71 year-old man with a gastrointestinal bleed and hypotension whose treatment was complicated by end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis and the patient having a history of congestive heart failure and systolic dysfunction and 3+ mitral regurgitation.
The patient's hypotension was presumed stable and all antihypertensive medications were held.
He received 1 liter intravenous fluid bolus and 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
Over the first night of admission the patient had 10 out of 10 chest pain in the substernal area with burning decreased with two sublingual nitroglycerin.
Bile was seen in the stomach and the esophagogastroduodenoscopy was normal to the third part of the duodenum and colonoscopy was recommended.
The patient received additional bolus of intravenous fluids with no change in saturations.
Cardiology consult was called and they recommended medical management and catheterization when the patient could tolerate anticoagulation.
The patient persistently refused drawing of blood despite the presence of triple lumen catheter in his right groin.
The patient was given GoLYTELY for colonoscopy prep and had persistent maroon stool.
The patient received additional one unit of packed red blood cells when hematocrit dropped again to 30%.
The patient had a polypectomy and there was another ulcer in the hepatic flexure consistent with ischemic colitis after hypotension.
Fem line was discontinued and the tip culture was sent and line was resighted to the left femoral vein with interventional radiology's assistance.
The line placement was extremely difficult given that he had multiple clots in multiple regions including the subclavians bilaterally and very narrow vessels in the femoral region bilaterally not allowing for the normal J wire to be passed through.
After being febrile the patient had persistent rigors and was found to have gram negative rods grow in his blood cultures.
The patient was covered with Vancomycin and Levofloxacin.
The patient was started on Cipro and Zosyn for double pseudomonal coverage.
The following day the patient was noted to be bleeding from his AV fistula site that was oozing stopping with pressure dressings applied.
Antibiotics were changed to Levofloxacin po given sensitivities found on the gram negative rods.
On [**2-19**] repair was attempted with fistulogram.
The patient was sent to the Operating Room with Vascular Surgery to have fistula repaired without difficulty.
Vancomycin was continued for faecalis to be continued renally dosed for two weeks of treatment.
The patient was instructed to follow up with gastrointestinal as an outpatient for additional colonoscopies and management of this potentially cancerous condition.
For non ST elevation myocardial infarction that occurred on [**2112-2-13**] the patient was maintained on beta-blockers by mouth and nitroglycerin prn for medical management to follow up with cardiology a full two weeks after having his polypectomy at which time it was presumed that anticoagulation would be safe.
For end stage renal disease on hemodialysis the patient had a left AV fistula that clotted and led to excessive bleeding after tissue plasminogen activator use and then with repair in vascular surgery.
The patient was maintained on Sevelamer and calcium acetate and aluminum hydroxide to keep his calcium phosphate less then 70.
He was maintained on Nephrocaps and a renal diet and lytes were monitored carefully.
He was in normal sinus rhythm throughout his stay and was maintained on Amiodarone and anticoagulation was held despite concerns for subsequent cerebrovascular accidents.
The patient also had gram positive anaerobic rod in one bottle that was Enterococcus faecalis managed on Vancomycin for a two week course renally dosed.
He was maintained on a diabetic diet and glucose levels were less then 200 throughout his stay.
Obstructive sleep apnea, the patient was maintained on BIPAP each night.
The patient was managed with Olanzapine prn and frequent reorientation.
He had physical therapy and occupational therapy assistance.
The patient agreed to have home VNA as condition for discharge with medical advice and he was set up for physical therapy and occupational therapy at home and he was able to transfer and ambulate with walker at the time of discharge.
Anemia due to blood loss.
Atenolol 25 mg po q.d.
Lipitor 20 mg po q.d.
Amiodarone 200 mg po q.d.
Multivitamin po q.d.
Nitroglycerin prn.
Calcium acetate two tablets po t.i.d.
Trazodone 25 mg h.s.
Sevelamer 1600 mg po t.i.d.
Levofloxacin 250 mg po q 48 hours for a 14 day course.
Tylenol prn.
Lisinopril 2.5 mg po q.d.
Aspirin 81 mg q.d.
The patient was instructed to not take Coumadin until he discussed it with his physician and discussed the benefits and drawbacks of anticoagulation given his multiple illnesses.
Vancomycin 1 gram at hemodialysis for a total of a 14 day course.
VNA was instructed to check the patient's blood pressure, monitor medication use and to help the patient ambulate with walker and transfer.
