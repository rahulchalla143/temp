She then was brought to the [**Hospital **] Hospital via EMS where she received activated charcoal, Mucomyst, Zofran and normal saline intravenous fluid resuscitation.
She was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for further management in the Medical Intensive Care Unit after receiving a reloading dose of Mucomyst.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, her peak Tylenol level was 5.1, peak AST and ALT were greater than 10,000, INR peaked at 4.3, total bilirubin peaked at 2.3.
The patient was continued on Mucomyst, anti-emetics and hydrated.
While her labs indicative of liver function continued to improve, her laboratory values also showed worsening renal function with creatinine on the day of transfer to the Regular Medicine Floor of 3.2.
She was fired recently from a job after management discovered money missing.
There was a right internal jugular central venous catheter in place without erythema or discharge.
Serum chemistry demonstrated a sodium of 141, potassium 3.6, chloride 106, bicarbonate 17, BUN 33, creatinine up to 4.2.
Calcium 7.9, phosphorus 3.6, magnesium 2.3.
HYPERTENSION / DEPRESSION, STATUS POST SUICIDE ATTEMPT WITH INGESTION OF TYLENOL P.M. TABLETS:  Her liver function tests were improving but renal function continued to decline.
As the patient was currently experiencing evidence of acute renal failure secondary to Tylenol induced acute tubular necrosis, Mucomyst was continued at a dose of 4200 mg intravenously q. four hours.
She was followed by the Hepatology Service status post her overdose attempt and her liver function tests and serum tests of liver function including albumin and INR were followed serially.
After several days on the Medicine Floor, her INR stabilized and Hepatology Service signed off.
They recommended continuing Mucomyst until there is no evidence of end organ damage.
At that time, she was also experiencing acidosis in the form of a bicarbonate level of 13 to 14 even with intravenous bicarbonate replacement.
The patient was continued on a regimen of hemodialysis initially daily and was spaced out to every two to three days.
In order to continue further renal protection, any further nephrotoxic agents were avoided.
Prior to initiating hemodialysis she had a temporary dialysis catheter placed which was then switched over to a permanent buried subclavian catheter later in her hospital course.
Per discussions with the Renal Team, the patient's renal function is slowly improving and it is likely she will not need hemodialysis permanently, however, it needs to continue in the interim until her renal function improves.
NAUSEA AND EMESIS:  The patient had persistent nausea and multiple episodes of emesis daily of non-bloody, non-bilious material.
She was managed initially conservatively with symptomatic relief with Zofran, Phenergan and Compazine with intravenous fluid hydration; however, she remained unable to tolerate any oral intake.
TPN was started on [**2127-12-5**].
This was after the patient had placement of a left PICC line with double lumen for TPN, laboratory draws and intravenous access, under fluoroscopy in the Interventional Radiology Suite.
The Gastroenterology Service was consulted for esophagogastroduodenoscopy to rule out gastritis or ulcer.
In the interim, her proton pump inhibitor was increased to 40 mg intravenously twice a day.
There was concern that the patient's persistent nausea and emesis was medication related due to her Mucomyst.
OPIUM ADDICTION:  Per report by the patient's parents and family members, there was evidence of opiate drugs and paraphernalia at her apartment.
She did have an episode during this hospital course where she had received upwards of 10 mg of morphine for her abdominal pain, nausea and emesis.
In response to this, she was administered Narcan times one dose.
There was some concern that she was undergoing acute opium withdrawal; therefore her pain control needs were reassessed and her morphine dose was titrated down appropriately.
If possible, pain relief needs should be managed with non-opiate medications.
Her hemodynamic status and pulsus paradoxus was monitored frequently.
Of note, her dialysis catheter and PICC line did not demonstrate any erythema, exudate or discharge.
For this she was treated with a three day course of Levofloxacin as well as a seven day course of Flagyl.
Initially, the patient was managed with Hydralazine 20 mg intravenously q. six hours.
As her blood pressure improved, Hydralazine was discontinued.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  As the patient was unable to maintain adequate oral intake in the setting of persistent nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, she was nutritionally repleted with total parenteral nutrition.
The dates of [**12-17**] and [**2127-12-18**], she demonstrated markedly improved oral intake and therefore TPN was discontinued.
They will follow serial laboratory evaluations of her renal function as well as her electrolytes.
Of note, they do not expect the patient to require hemodialysis for very much longer as her laboratory evaluations of renal function continue to improve.
