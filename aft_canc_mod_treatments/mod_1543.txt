The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization, which showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%, critical aortic stenosis with aortic valve area of 0.9 cm squared, dilated aortic root and noncritical lesions of his left main and his left anterior descending coronary artery.
Status post myocardial infarction [**2192-9-21**].
Hydroxyurea 500 mg po q day.

Dental consult on [**2192-10-30**] resulted in the decision that teeth #28 and #29 should be extracted prior to aortic valve placement.
Oral surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] for planned extraction.
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2192-11-1**] for extraction of teeth #28 and #29.
It was felt that his leukocytosis was due to his splenectomy and was not a factor in proceeding with surgery as the peripheral smear showed increased neutrophils.
The patient was taken to the Operating Room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] on [**2192-11-2**] for an aortic valve replacement with a 25 mm pericardial [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] valve.
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on Levophed, Milrinone and Aprotinin.
The patient's first 24 hours in the Intensive Care Unit was significant for increased chest tube output.
The patient received multiple blood products and transfusions to control his bleeding in the Operating Room as well as postoperatively.
The patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation on his first postoperative evening.
Milrinone was weaned to off.
The patient required aggressive pulmonary toilet in the Intensive Care Unit.
Hematology felt that his increasing leukocytosis was due to a postoperative leukemoid reaction from coronary artery bypass surgery and was not significant.
Chest tubes were removed on postoperative day number three.
After his chest tubes were removed it was noted that the patient had moderate amount of serosanguinous drainage from the chest tube sites.
This was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] and it was decided to obtain an echocardiogram to rule out the possibility of tamponade as the patient had a large amount of bleeding from his chest tube postoperatively.
Discussion with hematology about the increased drainage from his chest tube sites resulted in suggestion of holding the Hydroxyurea until drainage from his chest tube sites decreased.
Drainage from the chest tube sites subsequently decreased over the next few days.
He was able to ambulate approximately 100 feet using a walker for assistance.
There is a small to moderate amount of serosanguinous drainage from the chest tube site.
