He was on a phenylephrine drip because of hypotension.
He was then taken back to the operating room on [**11-12**], and [**Month/Year (2) **] a portal vein thrombectomy, tru-Cut biopsy of the liver, intraoperative ultrasound, left colectomy for ischemia, andclosure of the abdomen with Silastic (please see Operative note).
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the ICU following the operation in stable condition.
He remained intubated on AC support.
He required a large amount of blood products, as well, including 7 units of FFP, 8 units of packed red blood cells, 2 units of platelets, and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate.
Overnight, his pH normalized, and we had more success oxygenting/ventilating him, without the use of extreme vent settings.
He would continue to require vasopressor support.
His vent settings were adjusted daily, but for the most part, again, without the use of extreme vent settings.
He received TPN for nutritional support.
He continued on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and antifungal treatment.
He continued to make no urine, and required continuous CVVH.
He continued to remain coagulopathic, and required daily transfusions of blood products.
It should be noted that throughout his hospital course, it was insured that Mr. [**Known lastname **] received no heparin products, and the hematology/oncology service was consulted regarding his platelet drop.
The infectious disease team was consulted following positive blood cultures and sputum cultures for stenotrophomonas, and his antibiotic/antifungals were adjusted according to their recommedations, which included a regimen of tobramycin, meropenem, bactrim, vancomycin, and caspofungin.
So on [**11-18**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] an exploratory laparotomy, right hemicolectomy for ischemia, distal sigmoid colon resection for ischemia, liver biopsy, abdominal washout and end ileostomy (please see Operative note).
He required a large amount of blood products for a low hematocrit, coagulopathy, and again, a platelet count less than 5.
He required a bicarbonate drip.
He suffered from cardiac arrest several times throughout the day of [**11-18**], ACLS protocal was initiated each time, including chest compressions, and the use of atropine and epinephrine for asystole.
