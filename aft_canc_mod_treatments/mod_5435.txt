Admission Date:  [**2120-9-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-11-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-5-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Bactrim / Sudafed / Ifosfamide  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: Intractable vomiting  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left subclavian hemodialysis line insertion Hemodialysis Left salpingo-oophorectomy Small bowel resection   History of Present Illness: Patient transfer from OSH .
HPI: Patient is a 57 y/o woman with a PMH of DM type II, HTN, obesity and hyperlipidemia who presented to an OSH on [**9-16**] with complaints of 5 days of intractable vomiting and fatigue.
Initially the patient was given IVF hydration and kept NPO.
She was started on IVF with bicarb.
She was rate contolled with beta-blockers and anticoagulation was not continued because of hematocrit drop.
The decision was made to transfer her to [**Hospital1 18**] for further treatment of her lymphoma.
She was started on chemotherapy for lymphoma and received 4 doses of chemotherapy.
Following her HD treatment on [**2120-9-30**] she spiked to 101.8 and developed new oxygen requirements and placed on 100% NRB.
Ultimately, she was found to have a perforated jejunum and s/p ex-lap/small bowel resection/left salpingo-oophorectomy ([**10-2**]).
She had a CVL placed for CVVH, and was extubated on [**10-4**].
She is currently on TPN, and last PM developed atrial fibrillation, given amiodarone and converted to NSR.
She denies any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, headache, chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, shortness of breath.
Past Medical History: DM type II HTN Obesity Psoriasis h/o GI bleed [**2-8**] AVM on recent colonoscopy h/o squamous cell cancer of R leg   Social History: Lives with husband and step-son in [**Name2 (NI) 10358**] Mass.
A cytokeratin AE1/AE3 is negative.
The above histologic and reported immunohistochemical findings are consistent with a high-grade non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 57 y/o woman with h/o DM type II, HTN with newly diagnosed high grade lymphoma who had hospital course complicated by anuric renal failure requiring dialysis, acute respiratory failure, and jejunal perforation s/p ex-lap/small bowel resection/left salpingo-oophorectomy on [**10-2**].
Ultimately, she was found to have a perforated jejunum and s/p ex-lap/small bowel resection/left salpingo-oophorectomy ([**10-2**]), once the patient was stable she returned to BMT.
On return she was treated with IT-ARA- C ([**10-10**]) and on [**10-12**] IVAC chemo (2 doses of ifosfamide, 2 doses of cytarabine and 1 dose of etoposide).
This is a rare side effect of ifosfamide, and so she was given methylene blue as a treatment and her mental status improved.
During her course her cytogenetics returned and she was c-myc negative and her biopsy was consistent with high-grade non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma.
She remained clinically stable on the floor and given the new diagnosis she was treated with CHOP-R on [**2120-10-29**] (one dose).
Her blood counts were closely followed, and she did not require any interventions after her CHOP.
The patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] regarding future plan of treatment and will also be on filgrastim to prevent neutropenia.
Pulmonary (Cough): As above, the patient was transferred to the ICU for hypotension and respiratory failure, and was treated with oxygen as needed, nebs, and Zosyn for empiric coverage.
She was intubated for her bowel surgery and was successfully extubated.
She was continued on Vanc and Zosyn (which she was on after her bowel surgery).
In addition to the above measures as she was noted to have a persistent cough refractory to many anti-tussives, we stopped her lisinopril on [**2120-10-26**] and switched to valsartan.
She was noted to have enterococcus infection in her peritoneal fluid and was treated with vancomycin.
She was originally on several medications (zosyn, flagyl and vancomycin) for her bowel perforation but as she had no need for these medications they were all stopped.
Later in her course, she spiked a fever to 103 and was restarted on Vanc and Zosyn, and when she spiked again levofloxacin was added to better cover gram negsatives in gut.
Though, as above to cover for possible GI abscess she was remained on zosyn, vanc and levo.
As her abdominal pain and fevers resolved all of the above medications were discontinued.
Finally, in terms of infection, the patient was noted during her course to have oral lesions consistent with HSV (swab was positive), her pain and lesions improved with acyclovir treatment.
She was on an amiodorone drip in ICU, then oral and tapered off.
On the floor she developed afib with RVR and responded to IV lopressor and IV diltiazem.
They did not feel she needed amiodorone and thought once her chemo is finished and her hemotocrit, coags and platelets are stabilized coumadin/anti-coagulation could be readdressed.
The patient was on TPN after her bowel surgery and difficulty with food after her IVAC therapy.
At [**Hospital1 18**], she received rasburicase prior to chemo, and she was started on chemotherapy for lymphoma and received 4 doses of chemotherapy.
In the unit, she was treated with CVVHD (her original line clotted off) and by transfer back to the floor her renal function improved.
By discharge, her renal function was completely stable and no further intervention was needed.
Her psoriasis remained stable, and treatment in the future should be readdressed as an outpatient   Medications on Admission: Medications at home: Lipitor 40 mg QD lisinopril 40 mg QD Avandia 4 mg [**Hospital1 **] Lantus 40 U QHS, Regular ISS MVI Calcium Bowel regimen   Discharge Medications: 1.
