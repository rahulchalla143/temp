He is now POD #4 s/p T12-S1 laminectomy ([**2163-11-25**]).
He was of normal mental status on arrival but has had confusion and delirium since he was extubated which is the reason for transfer to medicine.
Of note, pt was initiated on an anesthesia study protocol post-op due to concern of opiate/alcohol use which included ketamine infusion and ativan scheduled.
He has also been receiving dilaudid po/iv prn and methocarbamol for pain control.
He has very poor dentition but recent dental work (most recently 5 years ago), his only recent surgery was hernia repair 2 months ago with mesh placement and does have urethral implant.
There was question of some nucal rigidity yesterday which has now resolved, no LP done given surgical site.
He received 4 doses gentamicin after his foley manipulation ([**11-24**] to [**11-27**]) and vancomycin post-operatively.
Of note pt had 6 french foley which required intraoperative placement after dilation and rigid cystoscopy by urology due to his urethral implants and artifical sphincter.
Past Medical History: HTN Hyperlipidemia Prostate CA s/p prostatectomy [**2157**] s/p urethral sphincter and penile implants [**2159**] Umbilical hernia repair 2 months ago.
+ Egobronchophonic change at Left lung base Abd: Soft, non-tender, not distended, + bs, no rebound or gaurding.
5/5 strength on plantar flexion bilaterally, [**12-20**] dorsiflex on left, [**4-18**] dorsiflex on right Back: (progressively less) beefy red laminectomy scar with scallopped edges about the suture and no surrounding erythema.
Multiple surgical instruments are projected posterior to the lumbar spine.
Subsegmental branches are well seen except in the inferior lower lobes, particularly on the right, and embolism can not be excluded here.
CXR: [**12-6**] - Left lateral decubitis 1.
Interval removal of a pigtail pleural catheter, with one catheter remaining.
A pigtail catheter remains in situ at the base of the left hemithorax.
Laminectomy is identified at the T11 and T12 vertebrae, following management of epidural abscess.
There are pleural parenchymal changes seen in the left base consistent with previous empyema and prior pigtail catheter placement.
There is a right-sided PICC line with distal lead tip in the distal SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY 61 yo male with PMH significant for HTN, HL, umbilical hernia repair 2 months agos who presented to an OSH on [**2163-11-25**] with severe LBP, fever to 101.3, and left foot drop and was found to have an L3 epidural abscess.
The delirium progressively resolved with rationalization of pain medication and treatment of infection which includes Strep milleri epidural abscess and LLL empyema.
Treated with t12-s1 laminectomy and vancomycin.
Initially treated with 4 day course of Vancomycin/Cefepime, which was switched to ceftriaxone for a six week course (end date [**2163-1-19**]).
Laminectomy sutures removed on [**2163-12-9**].
Patient will require dental care and colonoscopy outpatient for resolution of source issues.
Given recent intubation, patient treated for HAP vs VAP initially with  vancomycin and cefepime.
As it was thought the empyema may have been secondarily seeded from the epidural abscess, he was switched to ceftriaxone for four weeks.
Pulmonary pigtail catheter drains x2 were placed by IR on [**12-3**].
Initially, drainage increased on day 1 and 2.
Another repeat chest CT was performed and it showed resolution of the loculations with minimal fluid in pleural space that the position of the pigtail catheter would not be able to drain.
Thus, the second drain was removed [**12-14**].
Thoracic surgery felt the remaining fluid was likely left over TPA vs. sterile fluid (as pt.
Since he remained afebrile with no elevations in white count, no further intervention was performed.
To be discharged on condom catheter and f/u with urologist for reactivation of urethral stricture.
# Altered Mental Status: This was his reason for transfer to medicine, we feel that it was related to medications with an infectious component.
Those medications include ativan, valium, ketamine and methocarbamol.
To avoid worsening his condition, His pain control escalation was cautious with tramadol on [**11-28**], Oxycodone on [**11-29**] and Oxycontin with oxycodone breakthrough on [**11-30**].
His mental status cleared with pain control on Oxycontin 20/30 and prn oxycodone and resolution of his infection.
# Anemia: Normocytic with normal RDW with obvious drop 37-30 after surgery but still very low to begin with.
folate replacement will confuse folate levels.
Patient needs colonoscopy outpatient  # Hyperlipidemia: Continued statin  # Gout flare: Patient complained of right toe pain similar to previous gout flares.
Resolved with colchicine treatment.

You were noted to have a left lower lobe infection which required placement of a drain in your lung that was placed through your skin.
To ensure full drainage, Thoracic surgery was consulted and placed TPA in your drain and attached it to suction.
Thoracic surgery felt no further intervention was needed at this time, as they felt the fluid was likely left over TPA.
You are to follow up closely with thoracic surgery and have an appointment as below.
