Past Medical History: Coronary Artery Disease Mitral Regurgitation Heart Failure (systolic) Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation Renal Insufficiency Peripheral Vascular disease Hypertension Chronic Anemia AAA s/p Endovascular stent [**2129**] Myocardial Infarction [**2109**] Gout Osteoathritis Venous ligation GI bleeding   Social History: retired, worked in plastics factory, Married lives with spouse [**Name (NI) 1139**] - quit 25 years ago, 80 pack year history Denies ETOH  Family History: Brother and mother deceased from [**Last Name **] problem  Physical Exam: Blood pressure was 170/100 mm Hg while seated.
[**2133-2-2**] Chest X-ray: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: Presented for evaluation of chest pain, started on heparin for atrial fibrillation and underwent cardiac catheterization [**2133-1-30**] which revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.
Cardiac Surgery was consulted and he underwent preoperative workup.
While on heparin he developed both hematuria and bright red blood per rectum.
Heparin and plavix were stopped in anticipation of surgery and given his bleeding.
He went to the operating room on [**2133-2-3**] where coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels was performed as well as a mitral valve repair using a 26mm [**Company **] band.
Of note, left radial artery, internal mammary and saphenous vein was used for bypass conduit.
Postoperatively he was transferred to the cardiac surgery recovery unit for further monitoring.
He required bladder irrigation for hematuria in the OR which was continued in the unit.
Initially he required milrinone and pressors which were weaned off over 24 hours.
Bladder irrigation was stopped and he remained without hematuria.
On POD #2 he had atrial fibrillation which was treated with beta blockers and amiodarone.
As he remained in atrial fibrillation, heparin as a bridge to coumadin was started for anticoagulation.
He continued to make slow progress and remained in the unit for pulmonary care and diuresis until postoperative day six.
He will follow-up with the urology service for further management of his bladder mass.
His coumadin will be managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 24717**] for an INR of 2.0-2.5 for atrial fibrillation.
