Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal Intubation Central Venous Line Occuloplasty: Right Eye Lid approximation   History of Present Illness: 40 yo homeless [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] admitted for workup of acromegaly, found to have laboratory abnormalities consistent with tumor lysis syndrome, also with respiratory distress.
He was admitted on [**2144-7-11**] as OSH transfer for multiple concerns including bell's palsy, urinary retention, pituitary macroadenoma, acromegaly, persistent sinus tachycardia, scrotal pain and swelling, bilateral LE weakness, thecal/ epidural enhancement in thoracic region, and tumor lysis syndrome concerning for underlying malignancy.
Cardiology was consulted for persistent sinus tachycardia non-responsive to IV fluids and he was started on po metoprolol 50mg TID.
He was being treated w/ acyclovir and prednisone for question of viral-induced Bell's Palsy.
Heme/onc on the day prior to transfer attempted bone marrow biopsy but could not obtain due to respiratory distress induced with prone positioning.

RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Intubated on [**7-12**] in the setting of LLL PNA, lactic acidosis, and significant evidence of infiltrative malignant process on CT with peribronchial thickening.
Respiratory status improved on broad spectrum abx and significant diuresis.
Patient was gradually weaned on PSV and successfully extubated on [**7-30**].
Patient received vanco, meropenem, cipro, cefepime, and doxycycline during his stay.
Starting [**7-22**], patient was neutropenic and put on prophylactic fluconazole, acyclovir, and atovaquone.
HIV, HBV, HCV, galactomannan, and B-glucan were negative as was evidence for acute CMV or HHV-6 infection.
Cultures from an A-line and from an IJ both grew coag-negative staph on [**7-25**] and [**7-27**] respectively, which was covered by vancomycin.
Treatment with doxycycline and ciprofloxacin was also continued for mycoplasma hominis pneumonia.
Atovaquone was switched to IV bactrim after extubation.
Tumor lysis labs started to rise again on [**7-21**] with chemo and patient received 1 dose rasbiricase on [**7-24**].
Tumor lysis labs stabilized thereafter and UOP>100cc/hr and allopurinol was maintained.
Hyper-CVAD started on [**7-21**] and intrathecal chemo given 2x/wk alternating methotrexate and cytarabine for + malignant cells on LP.
Future imaging should include gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the head to pursue possible radiation (pt's original complaints of CN V and VII palsies possibly related to lymphoma vs acromegaly).
Patient then started on R-[**Hospital1 **] alternating with HD MTX chemotherapy.
Patient developed lower extremity weakness and severe polyneuropathy (followed by neurology), either from oncovorin therapy or presumed leptomeningeal disease.
As such, oncovorin was held in the R-EP(O)CH therapy.
Patient received his last treatment with HD methotrexate on [**11-6**] and is day 7 at discharge with evidence of his counts approaching nadir.
He will be continued on leucovorin for 2 more days given that he had significant mucositis in the past from MTX.
He should start on neupogen on [**11-13**] and should be stopped as advised by his outpatient oncologist once he is through his nadir.
He should be started on neupogen on [**11-13**].
Patient was maintained on low dose metoprolol.
Patient's heart rate in high 90s, low 100s typically, even on low-dose metoprolol.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Bump in creatinine from baseline 0.6 to 1.6 early in admission, thought to be ATN secondary to tumor lysis with contributions from one episode of hypotension just after intubation and IV contrast.
Abdomen remained soft but no stool for 6 days despite colace, senna, dulcolax, lactulose, SC methylnaltrexone, and PO narcan.
Patient continued to feel constipated but was having BM's - aggressive control of bowel regimen is required for patient comfort - through medications, ambulation, hydration.
Thought to be due to the dexamethasone, antibiotics in D5W and acromegaly.
Maintained with ISS and insulin drip to glucoses < 200.
On heparin gtt.
Transitioned to Lovenox for oupatient management on 10.28.
This should be continued for a minimum 6 months and should be addressed by his outpatient oncologist.
