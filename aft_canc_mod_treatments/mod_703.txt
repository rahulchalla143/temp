A right-sided Port-A-Cath catheter terminates in the distal SVC.
Increased size of subcapsular hepatic collection containing both low-density and high-density material, most consistent with a hematoma.
The external-internal hepatobiliary drain passes through this collection.
[**6-20**] CXR: Port-A-Cath catheter tip terminates at the level of mid low SVC.
NG tube was inserted recently, with its tip most likely in the stomach, although not clearly seen.
Right Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of mid SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: **Patient was made comfort measures only during hospitalization  []BRIEF CLINICAL COURSE: Pt is a 69 yo pancreatic cancer (on paclitaxel, last dose 6/25) s/p Whipple ([**3-/2125**]) originally presented with jaundice and biliary obsruction on [**6-16**].
He failed ERCP decompression and underwent PTBD on [**6-6**].
He also developed MSSA bacteremia on [**6-16**] currently on nafcillin (TTE negative).
Plan was for placement of metal biliary [**Month/Year (2) **] with IR today.
Bladder scan was remarkable for >700cc, although his foley was flushed and exchanged without return.
Coudet was placed given history of prostate cancer and previous radiation therapy, again without return.
Patient's antibiotics were expaneded to vancomycin and cefepime and patient was bolused 2L NS without improvement in BP.
He was bolused with albumin and normal saline, but SBPs were in the mid 80s, and he was started on low-dose Levophed.
He received a paracentesis.
Nephrology thought the etiology of his renal failure was either AIN from Nafcillin vs. ATN from hypotension.
Pt was started on Vancomycin and Cefepime.
Known urinary incontinence following radiation prostate cancer.
# MSSA Bacteremia: Have switched nafcillin to vancomycin and cefepime given hypotension.
Pt was made CMO and antibiotics were stopped.
# Elevated INR: Elevated to 2.1 on transfer to MICU, this reversed with Vitamin K and therefore was thought to be nutritional.
Pt's coumadin was held due to bleeding risk.
# Cough: Significant R sided pleural effusion s/p diagnostic thoracentesis on [**2127-6-18**].
Likely related to underlying malignancy, although could consider pneumonic process as well given current hypotension.
Pancreatic Cancer: patient is s/p Whipple with known mets to regional lymph nodes.
Prostate Cancer: s/p radiation, on dutasteride at home (not on formulary, so held)  #.
Afib: Home regimen includes Carvedilol and warfarin.
Latest coumadin regimen is 2.5 mg one-half tab daily.
These medications were held.
