Admission Date: [**2193-2-18**]        Discharge Date: [**2193-3-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2138-10-6**]        Sex:  M  Service:   HISTORY:  This was a 54-year-old male with past medical history significant for non-Hodgkin lymphoma status post chemotherapy and status post mini-allogeneic BMT complicated by graft versus host disease for skin, liver, GI, and lungs.
He was originally admitted on [**2193-2-18**] for shortness of breath, increasing edema, and change in mental status to the Medicine Service.
His hospital course was complicated by atrial fibrillation and new flutter status post DC cardioversion on [**2193-2-22**].
The patient had recurrence of his aflutter on [**2193-2-26**] on amiodarone associated with hypertension and was transferred to the CCU.
The patient was started on Natrecor and Lasix with minimal diuresis complicated by hypertension and Natrecor was discontinued.
The patient was eventually extubated on [**2193-3-7**] and placed intermittently on BiPAP for hypercapnia and fatigue.
Due to the patient's constrictive pericarditis possibly secondary to his graft versus host disease, a pericardial stripping was performed on [**2193-3-12**] for improvement in hemodynamics by cardiothoracic surgery.
The patient did well post pericardial stripping with excellent diuresis.
The patient was transferred to the CCU for further diuresis after his pericardial stripping.
The patient was complaining of some difficulty swallowing and sore throat on [**2193-3-17**] and his tube feeds were held due to his difficulty swallowing and his need for BiPAP.
It was felt that the patient may had an aspiration event and was started on Flagyl and a speech and swallow evaluation was ordered.
Given the patient's difficulty with his respiratory status, it was unable to perform a swallowing study and the patient was closely monitored with holding of tube feeds.
The patient required emergent intubation in the evening of [**2193-3-18**] for respiratory distress.
Copious thin secretions were removed.
The patient was noted to have secretions of 400 to 500 cc of bloody tube feeds.
The patient was placed on multiple blood pressure support medications including dopamine and Neo-Synephrine drips.
Prior to placing his Swan-Ganz catheter to evaluate likely septic physiology, the patient went into a systolic arrest.
ACLS was performed with multiple epinephrine, bicarbonate, atropine x20 minutes without success.
