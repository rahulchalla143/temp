MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Insulin 70/30, Tagamet, allopurinol, aspirin, Cardizem, Toprol-XL, Lasix, Zestril.
She underwent preoperative right renal kidney embolization followed by going to the operating room on [**2156-3-30**], and underwent a right radical nephrectomy utilizing a thoracoabdominal approach.
She left the operating room with a chest tube, epidural catheter, and Foley.
Urine output for the case was 335 cc, and she was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells intraoperatively.
She was given imipenem preoperatively for a Klebsiella urinary tract infection as well as to empirically cover her embolization procedure, and this was continued postoperatively.
The chest tube was followed serially and had a persistent air leak.
She was originally managed on an epidural and ultimately transitioned to a patient-controlled analgesia and then to oral pain medications including Percocet as needed.
Postoperatively, in the acute period she was treated with Lopressor intravenously and hydralazine, and ultimately was converted over to her Adalat and Toprol-XL.
She did have creatinine values as high as 1.6, but was otherwise making adequate urine, and the Foley catheter was removed postoperatively without any retention problems.
She did notice a gouty flare and was ultimately started on colchicine and Indocin as needed.
She did have some mild congestive symptoms that were treated with empiric intravenous Lasix, and this subsided quickly.
Her blood sugars were well controlled throughout the postoperative course on a sliding-scale, and she was ultimately was put back on her home regimen.
She did have persistent diarrhea, and an Infectious Disease consultation was obtained, and they recommended another course of Flagyl to be continued for 14 days total.
