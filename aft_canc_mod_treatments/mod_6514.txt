We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and Ibuprofen etc.
Continue Sinus Precautions for an additional two weeks.
You are required to take Prednisone, an oral steroid, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as this medication can cause stomach irritation.
Prednisone should also be taken with a glass of milk or with a meal.
