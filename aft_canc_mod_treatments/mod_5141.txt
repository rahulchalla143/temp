A right PICC line is present with tip overlying the expected  region of the mid SVC.
The second two abnormalites suggest a moderate encephalopathy, which may be seen with toxic metabolic abnormalities, medication effect or infections .
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 60 year old woman with a hx of paraimmunoblastic CLL, s/p MUD allo transplant ~ 90 days post, hx of DVTs and PE on lovenox, who presented from [**Hospital **] Rehab having had an acute onset of seizures.
The patient's BP was controlled with metoprolol and nifedipine.
Clinically there were no signs of meningitis, however patient was treated with meningitis doses of ceftriaxone, vancomycin and acyclovir.
Acyclovir, bactrim, and protonix were discontinued due to their possible marrow related effects.
# AMS: The altered mental status was thought to be a combination of her postictal state coupled with reversible posterior encephalopathy and cyclosporin toxicity.
The mental status improved sometime after 48 hours in the ICU, with a decreased level of cyclosporin.
# CLL s/p allo transplant 90 days: the cyclosporin levels were monitored on a daily basis and the patient was also maintained on her outpatient dose of prednisone.
The cyclosporin dose was lowered from 225 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 175 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 75 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Lovenox was briefly held for 12 hours prior to the patient having a lumbar puncture.
She was placed on a ground solid/thin liquid diet.
#ACCESS - as she was afebrile and doing well, permanent vascular access was secured via surgery with the placement of a double-lumen port-a-cath.
