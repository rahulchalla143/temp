STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE.
ERCP was done with biliary slude removal and new stent placement.
Initiall on levofloxacin and flagyl.
tailored to levofloxacin alone per ID recommendations.
TTE was done that showed a small vegetaion on aortic valve vs thickened vale.
Needed prn doses inaddition t standing doses of diltiazem for rate control.
In ICU also started on metoprolol to control RVR.
However, he then became hypotensive after each dose of lopressor and lopressor was discontinued.
He was also started on Coumadin.
He was briefly on a heparin drip, however this was stopped after transfer to the floor since his CHADS2 score is only 2.
Coumadin was however stopped after the results of TTE were obtained as likely vegetation due risk of bleeding.
Levofloxacin can sometimes cause ventricular arrythmias, and ID team was reconsulted about this.
The risk of infective endocarditis, need for potential IV and long term antibiotics, need for TEE, possibility of thromboembolic phenomena due to endocarditis and CVA, bacteremia, speard of infection to other parts of body and potentially death etc was explained to him and he comprehended the risks of leaving AMA.
On the evening of discharge after the patient had left the hospital AMA, I recieved a tel call from [**Location (un) 535**] that levofloxacin is to covered by his insurance.
This was substituted to ciprofloxacin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] and the pharmacist was informed to tell patient to see PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2678**].
