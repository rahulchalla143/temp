Patient was apneic post-operatively attributed to paralytics, for which she was intubated and placed on AC until the paralytic wore off.
She was then weaned to CPAP and extubated to high flow facemask without difficulty.
She was later switched to high flow face tent and then nasal canula 4L->2L and was comfortable sating 92%.

[**2154-8-30**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP) FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal tube has been removed.
[**2154-8-30**] Pathology Tissue: Tracheal tumor Distal ,   [**2154-8-30**] [**Last Name (LF) 829**],[**First Name3 (LF) 828**] C. Not Finalized   Brief Hospital Course: # Apnea/Hypoxia: The patient experienced apnea in the immediate post-operative period following debridement of a tracheal nodule.
The prolonged hypoxia post-operatively was attributed to aspiration pneumonitis likely with an element of post-operative inflammation from the procedure itself.
The patient was eventually transitioned to high flow face mask, followed by high-flow face tent, followed by nasal cannular on 4L.
The patient was taken off supplemental oxygen the following day and sat'ed within her normal baseline range 88-92% on room air without any problems at rest.
However, patient desaturated with physical therapy during activity.
They recommended home oxygen (2L with activity)when ambulating with a walker.
The patient will be discharged with home oxygen as well as VNA services.
The low Hct is most likely attributable to fluids received during procedure and minimal blood loss, however given the 12 point drop, her lab values were followed and the Hct level was stable and began to rise without event or concern for chonic blood loss.
# Non-Small Cell Lung CA: A new tracheal mass identified on CT in [**Month (only) **] was highly concerning for metastasis and likely to grow to occlude airway the airway, so surgical debridement was warranted with interventional pulmonology without intraoperative complications outside of apnea/hypoxia as elaborated on above.
The patient is now POD#2 s/p debridment by IP.
She is followed by interventional pulmonology for continued management.
[**Name (NI) **] quite clearly does not desire intubation or heroic measures.
# IDDM: Continued home glargine and home meds.
# HTN: Continued amlodipine, lopressor and ASA.

You underwent this procedure with the interventional pulmonologists.
After surgery you were found to have difficulty breathing and decreased oxygen levels that were thought to be a result of both the paralytic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] used during surgery as well as the possibility that you aspirated fluids into your trachea/lungs during surgery.
As such, you were intubated and transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for respiratory care and support.
In the MICU, your blood oxygen levels improved over the course of a day on supplemental oxygen and you were transitioned from a face-mask to a face-tent to a nasal cannula on supplementary oxygen.
When your oxygen levels stabilized, you were transferred to the inpatient floor, where you were eventually weaned off of supplementary oxygen.
3) Decreased your metoprolol to 50 mg twice a day from 150 mg  Followup Instructions: Please follow-up with your primary care physician 7-10 days following discharge.
