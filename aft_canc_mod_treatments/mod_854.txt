Admission Date:  [**2104-2-19**]       Discharge Date:   Service:  Medicine/Medical Intensive Care Unit  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 88-year-old female of Philippina origin with a history of bronchial adenocarcinoma, status post right lower lobe and right middle lobe resection in [**2101-12-5**], without chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and with a questionable cerebellar mass, possible metastasis diagnosed in [**2102-6-5**] by head CT which has remained unchanged, and history of mild baseline Alzheimer's dementia who was living at home and fully capable of activities of daily living two days prior to the date of presentation who has a more recent past medical history significant for an appendectomy in [**2103-9-5**] with a perioperative non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, a left femoral popliteal to common femoral lower extremity deep venous thrombosis diagnosed in [**Month (only) **], hypertension, recurrent urinary tract infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus urosepsis in [**2103-10-6**], was in her usual state of health significant for a recent weight loss of approximately five pounds, down to a weight of 65 pounds, until two days prior to admission when she had begun to have a cough productive of some mild sputum and general feeling of malaise with some mild nausea without vomiting, who continued good p.o.
intake (according to the family) who noted urine output drop over the two to three days prior to presentation.
On the way to the Emergency Room via the family's automobile the patient became apneic and the daughter performed mouth-to-mouth ventilation for a few seconds until the patient's respirations started again spontaneously.
She received intravenous fluids through a left femoral triple lumen central catheter which was placed.
The patient was given ceftriaxone 2 g intravenously times one in the Emergency Department and was also given calcium gluconate, insulin, and glucose, and Kayexalate for a high potassium level.
An nasogastric tube was placed.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient was notable for a temperature of 96.7 upon arrival, a heart rate of 68, blood pressure of 52/41, respiratory rate of 28, satting 86% on a nonrebreather.
Head, ears, nose, eyes and throat examination revealed left pupil to be post surgical and difficult to evaluate.
Status post appendectomy with perioperative non-Q-wave myocardial infarction on [**2103-10-9**].
The patient currently on anticoagulation therapy on the day of admission.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  On admission the patient was taking Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Aricept 5 mg p.o.
q.d., Protonix 40 mg p.o.
q.d., magnesium hydroxide 400 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o.
three days per week, lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o.
three days per week, Norvasc 2.5 mg p.o.
three days per week, Imdur 3 mg p.o.
two days per week, Lasix 20 mg p.o.
three days per week, K-Dur 20 mEq p.o.
three days per week, Coumadin 2 mg p.o.
q.h.s., vitamin E 400 IU p.o.
q.d., Tylenol 650 mg p.o.
Urinalysis was notable to 6 to 10 red blood cells, status post Foley placement, 0 to 2 white blood cells, and was negative otherwise with 3 to 5 squamous epithelial cells, and 0 to 2 hyaline casts.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted and taken to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with ventilatory support, status post intubation and continued aggressive fluid resuscitation for hypotensive condition.
The patient subsequently received a bronchoscopy in the Intensive Care Unit that night which showed some small mucous plugging in the right upper lobe with no endobronchial lesions.
Status post bronchoscopy, the patient's saturations markedly improved to 100%, and her peripheral cyanosis resolved, and her arterial blood gas essentially normalized.
The patient continued to improve over the subsequent three to four days of her hospital admission but was difficult to wean off the ventilator with moderate secretions, continued low compliance, and low volumes; although, her arterial blood gases remained relatively normal.
She was started on levofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed community-acquired pneumonia and gentle restriction of her fluids, and diuresis was attempted given the question of possible water overload contributing to her lung difficulties.
On hospital days 12 through 14 she began to have increased sputum production with occasional desaturation episodes resolved with aggressive suctioning and copious removal of secretions via her endotracheal tube.
She was started on vancomycin and Bactrim and showed improved respiratory parameters.
She was weaned to a pressure support of [**9-8**] for 48 hours on hospital day 14.
On hospital day 14, the patient was extubated and initially tolerated this well with a nonrebreather 100% face mask; however, she became progressively tachypneic, and tachycardic, to the 130s and hypertensive to the 180s, with a short period of approximately five minutes of supraventricular rhythm appearing on the monitor.
At this point, the decision for the patient to receive a tracheostomy in light of her failed extubation attempts, her prolonged time on a ventilator, and with endotracheal intubation, and the aggressive suctioning; although, her secretions had significantly decreased since the patient had been started on vancomycin and Bactrim, after culture results indicated a ventilator-associated pneumonia as described above.
The patient underwent a bedside tracheostomy after discussion with the family and the patient on [**2104-3-6**] without incident.
The patient presented as Clostridium difficile positive on hospital day two and was kept on Flagyl throughout her initial hospital stay both for the community-acquired pneumonia and Clostridium difficile.
The patient was started on vancomycin and Bactrim.
At that time Levaquin was discontinued.
Flagyl was continued for Clostridium difficile until hospital day 17 when subsequent Clostridium difficile toxins had been negative, and the patient had been forming formed stools for two weeks; at which point it was discontinued.
The plan was to continue a 14-day course of vancomycin and Bactrim to be completed on [**2104-3-15**].
Efforts to diuresis were limited contraction alkalosis and decreased blood pressures.
The patient was restarted on the captopril for afterload reduction on [**2-24**] and titrated up to a dose of 25 mg p.o.
From that time forward, the patient was not restarted on her beta blocker; however, she probably should be at some point in the near when she overcomes her acute illness.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION/RENAL:  The patient presented with baseline chronic renal insufficiency as indicated by a baseline creatinine of 0.7; given her body weight.
The patient received periodic electrolyte repletion on a p.r.n.
She was treated with Flagyl through hospital day 17, at which point it was discontinued.
KUB films obtained at these times were both negative and within normal limits, and these episodes of mild abdominal pain resolved with bowel regimen and subsequent bowel movements.
The patient received a bedside placement of percutaneous gastrojejunal tube on [**3-6**] through which tube feeds were resumed.
The patient previously had been on a nasogastric tube feeds of Ultracal at a goal of 40 cc per hour since hospital day four with multivitamin supplements and on Zantac prophylaxis.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused with one unit of blood on two separate occasions during her hospital stay for slowly dropping hematocrits which were felt to be consistent with phlebotomy; given an appropriate bump in hematocrit post transfusion and no signs or symptoms of ongoing bleeding.
However, the patient was changed from Zantac to Protonix because of this.
The patient was continued on heparin intravenously per standard protocol from the date of admission throughout her hospital stay for the known diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis in the left proximal vein.
On completion of her procedures, on [**3-6**], the patient was restarted on her Coumadin in anticipation of discontinuing heparin once her INR reached therapeutic levels.
LINES:  The patient had received a left femoral triple lumen central venous catheter in the Emergency Department on the day of admission which was discontinued on hospital day 15 for concern of the patient's rising white blood cell count in that period, although there were no local signs of infection, and culture of the catheter tip was negative.
The patient had a right femoral arterial line placed on the day of admission which was discontinued on [**2104-3-6**].
The patient received periodic glucose monitoring and fingerstick blood sugars which were within normal limits to slightly elevated, but never above 180.
The patient was covered with insulin sliding-scale which was rarely implemented.
PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient received prophylactic Pneumo boots, heparin drip, and Zantac or Protonix throughout her hospital stay.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was stable as of [**3-6**] awaiting placement and transfer to an appropriate rehabilitation facility.
Heparin drip per standard protocol with PTT monitored to keep at a therapeutic level of 61 to 100, common drip rate is 350 units per hour.
Captopril 25 mg p.o.
Prevacid suspension 30 mg per nasogastric tube q.d.
Ultracal tube feeds at a goal of 40 cc per hour.
Multivitamin elixir q.d.
Bactrim 200 mg per PEG q.d.
Coumadin 2 mg p.o.
