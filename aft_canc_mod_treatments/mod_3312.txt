There are several areas of brain edema identified in the left frontal and parietal lobe and both temporal lobes, which are suspicious for areas of metastatic disease with surrounding edema.
There is increased signal seen along the sulci on FLAIR images at the convexity which could be secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage.
A right IJ central venous line is at the level of the mid SVC.
IVC filter and probable NU stent catheter on the left also noted.
Vague right lower lobe opacity most likely represents pulmonary edema though if opacity persistent after diuresis, aspiration and pneumonia will become considerations.
ETT 4 cm above the carina with NG tube advancement into the stomach.
ET tube in standard placement.
Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
The ET tube and right PICC line in standard placements.
Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
The patient's neurologic exam (performed after sedation removed >48 hours) revealed intact brainstem function without evidence of higher cortical activity.
Final neurologic assessment was that the patient was unlikely to regain meaningful neurologic functioning.
# Respiratory Failure - Pt arrived on pressure support ventilation, which was changed to Assist control to make patient more comfortable.
She was originally intubated for airway protection, and it is felt she could likely be weaned from the ventilator although she would be extremely high risk for aspiration.
Due to family request to move patient to a hospital closer to home, she will remain intubated until transfer, with plan to extubate upon arrival to Women and [**Hospital 60658**] hospital with initiation of full palliative care and compliance of DNI status.
At OSH, she was treated with 7 days of vancomycin, as well as 13 days (of 14-day planned course) of Ciprofloxacin and Zosyn.
Could have still seeding of nephrostomy tube.
She was continued on zosyn and vancomycin to complete a >14 day course.
Antibiotics were discontinued on [**3-21**].
Upon discussion with him it was noted that the patient had progression of her disease after systemic therapy with topotecan and cisplatin.
She then proceed to XRT with cisplatin which she was unable to tolerate this secondary to thrombocytopenia (40-50K).
Patient was on pneumoboots while in hospital.
Total body volume overloaded.
Water Deficit 2.5 L. She was continued on free H20 boluses and D5 1/2 NS and corrected.
# Access - R IJ changed sterilly over wire [**3-7**] .
