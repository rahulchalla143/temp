A ventriculostomy catheter is again noted from a right frontal approach terminating in the third ventricle.
IMPRESSION: Multiple parenchymal metastases, grossly similar to the [**2127-1-2**] head MRI allowing for differences in modalities, with unchanged 3 mm leftward shift of midline structures.
During her stay, she was continued on steroids and an uptitrated antiepileptic regimen.
# Seizures/Altered Mental Status: likely due to brain mets and edema.
She was taking Lamotrigine 150mg [**Hospital1 **] at home (though no blood level was obtained on admission) and she was started on here.
In addition, prior to transfer she had been started on Levetiracetam 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] and Dexamethasone 4mg Q6H, tapered changed to Q8H.
She will likely need to stay on steroids in the long run because she has headache when they are tapered off.
