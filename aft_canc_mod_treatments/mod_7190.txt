The pericardial fluid was sent for cytology and a drain was left in place.
He was appropriately pre-op'ed and consented, and underwent a sub-xiphoid pericardial window procedure with placement of IVC filter for DVT prophylaxis (due to the importance of discontinuation of his anticoagulation due to his hemopericardium and drastically supra-therapeutic INR).
By post-operative day 3 the patient was weaned off all pressors, and by post-operative day 4 he was stable for transfer out of the ICU and to the floors following removal of his pericardial drain.
His Metoprolol was increased to 3-time daily dosing and a Cardiology consult was obtained.
Additionally, Cardiology recommended ASA 325mg (daily) alone for anticoagulation due to his risk of bleeding and the low likelihood that his (presumed temporary) post-operative atrial fibrillation would pose a risk for thrombus formation.
Of note, the patient was temporarily placed on a Lasix regimen of 20mg daily for significant bilateral lower extremity edema, but had two episodes of mild hypotension on post-operative days 8 and 10 - both of which responded well to fluid boluses- after which time the Lasix was discontinued.

Discharge Instructions: * You were admitted to the hospital with accumulation of fluid around your heart that resulted in difficulty breathing, and subsequently underwent a procedure to evacuate this fluid called a "pericardial window."
Post-operatively you were also noted to have some changes in the pattern of your heartbeats for which you were evaluated by the cardiologists and prescribed some new medications.
Currently you are recovering well and ready for discharge home * Continue to take your new cardiac medications as prescribed * Your Warfarin was discontinued during your hospital stay due to concern of bleeding.
Do not resume your Warfarin for at least 4-6 weeks or until instructed to do so by your Cardiologist.
Continue taking Aspirin 325mg daily for anticoagulation * Continue to use your incentive spirometer 10 times an hour while awake.
* You may continue to need pain medication once you are home but you can wean it over a few weeks as any lingering discomfort resolves.
Make sure that you have regular bowel movements while on narcotic pain medications as they are constipating which can cause more problems.
* No driving while taking narcotic pain medication.
* Take Tylenol  650 mg every 6 hours in between your narcotics.
If your doctor allows you may also take Ibuprofen to help relieve the pain.
Wash incision with mild soap & water, rinse, pat dry * No tub bathing, swimming or hot tubs until incision healed * No lotions or creams to incision site * Walk 4-5 times a day and gradually increase your activity as you can tolerate.
