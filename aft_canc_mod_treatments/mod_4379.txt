Initial impression was for systolic CHF and patient was given lasix IV.
At the OSH, cardiology consultation recommended a dose reduction in her carvedilol and initiated low dose ACE.
Consideration was given to ICU transfer for dopamine assisted diuresis, but consultation with CHF service lead to referral to [**Hospital1 18**] for milrinone assisted diuresis.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Echocardiogram, transthoracic [**2144-5-4**]: The left atrium is elongated.
Amongst the most common causes of encephalopathy are metabolic disturbances, medications, infection, and anoxia.
At the outside hospital, treatment with furosemide dropped the patient's blood pressure to the 90s, and it was felt that inotropic support would be required for diuresis.
Milrinone was initiated, but this resulted in hypotension and tachyarrhythmias, so it was stopped.
Phenylephrine and vasopression were added, and the patient was diuresed with a Lasix drip.
Between [**2144-4-21**] and [**2144-5-1**], the patient reaccumulated fluid in the setting of blood transfusions and fluid boluses for GI bleeding and low urine output.
Between [**2144-5-1**] and [**2144-5-10**], diuresis proceeded with IV Lasix without any need for pressors or inotropic support.
# Hypotension/pressor requirement: The patient had persistent hypotension, requiring vasopressors between [**2144-4-13**] and [**2144-4-29**].
Phenylephrine was started first, then vasopressin was added.
For the latter, the patient received blood transfusions.
With time the patient's hypotension resolved, and by [**2144-4-29**], she was off of all pressors.
# Respiratory failure: The patient developed hypercarbic respiratory failure, requiring intubation on [**2144-4-13**].
The heme/onc service was consulted, and recommended palliative care.
PET/CT could be considered for further staging, but this might not affect the patient's management.
ERCP was consulted for possibility of endoscopic resection, but given the high risk of complications (10%) and need for emergent surgery that the patient would likely not tolerate, this was thought to pose more risk than benefit to the patient.
The patient was transfused a total of 9 units PRBCs between [**2144-4-19**] and [**2144-5-1**].
Of note, the initial Hct drop occurred in the setting of a heparin drip, with was subsequently discontinued.
Mandibular culture grew [**Female First Name (un) **] and vancomycin-resistent enterococcus.
Enteral tube feeding was initiated, but it was stopped because the patient pulled out her feeding tube.
The patient was treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl.
This was felt to be related to medications and the ICU environment, although the patient's mental status remained significantly altered even after many days off medications.
The milrinone drip was discontinued.
A magnet was placed over her ICD.
