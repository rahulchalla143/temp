A cholecystectomy was performed as well as an open liver biopsy given the nodular appearance of his liver, felt to be consistent with cirrhosis.
He was transferred to the medicine service at [**Hospital1 **] where discussion was held concerning transplant given the extent of his liver disease, based on the liver biopsy which showed cirrhosis with moderate activity.
He was started on Midodrine and Octreotide on [**11-3**] with delay in the progression of his renal failure, though it eventually increased to 5.2 (from baseline 0.8) at the time of transfer.
Patient was also noted to have mental status changes felt to be secondary to uremia and for this reason, an HD line was placed for impending HD.
Since liver transplantation was being considered, the decision was made to transfer the patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and thus patient was    Past Medical History: Alcoholic Cirrhosis s/p repair of liver laceration Hepatorenal syndrome  Social History: Patient reports heavy alcoholism, but stopped approximately 4 months ago.

There is a dual-chamber central venous line with one tip terminating in the cavoatrial junction and the other tip terminating low in the right atrium near the IVC-right atrial junction.
Impression: Normal mucosa in the colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: CT colonography for evaluation of the right colon and cecum  EGD ([**11-25**]): Tortuous esophagus Blood in the stomach body Normal mucosa in the duodenum Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  CT colongraphy ([**11-25**]): Possible flat lesion (vs adherent stool) within the mid to distal one third of the transverse colon.
Please corelate with colonoscopy and if area not reached consider re-endoscopy.
A single-piece polypectomy was performed using a hot snare.
The result of the rest injection study is consistent with the presence of pulmonary arteriovenous shunting (one single bubble in 20 cardiac cycles seen in left atrium).
Brief Hospital Course: At [**Hospital6 **] he underwent an exploratory laparotomy and was found to be bleeding from multiple segments of his liver.
He also experience ARF and was thought to have hepatorenal syndrome therefore he was started on midodrine and octreotide on [**11-3**].
Cr continued to rise and a tunneled hemodialysis line was placed.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-19**] for consideration and workup for liver transplantation.
He was evaluated by the renal transplant team who felt he would need a combined liver and kidney transplantation.
He was listed for transplant with a MELD of 28. .
2 units of FFP and 1 units of platlets were transfused.
Neurology thought he was having a non-convulsive status and ativan was given x 1.
In the MICU he was started on keppra and he underwent an EEG which showed no seizure activity.
Mental status change was partially attributed to hepatic encephalopathy and increased doses of lactulose and rifaximin were given.
This demonstrated four lesions in the brain parenchyma, as seen on the FLAIR sequence, one of which had blood products within and corresponded to the previously noted small intraparenchymal hematoma in the right parietal lobe.
Assessment was somehwat limited due to lack of IV contrast.
An octreotide drip was started.
Dermatology evaluated the drug rash and ordered triamcinolone cream [**Hospital1 **] on the rash.
Derm felt the drug rash was benign and recommended vancomycin for the abdominal cellulitis.
A postpyloric feeding tube was placed for malnutrition.
He underwent transplant of both organs and required hepaticojejunostomy for a bile leak.
Induction immunosuppression was given per protocol.
Two JPs were placed around the liver and one near the kidney.
A ureteral stent was also placed.
He was transferred to the SICU immediately following surgery intubated where vasopressin was weaned off and levophed was increased.
His IV lines were exchanged and the HD line removed.
He received blood products to maintain hemostasis per guidelines.
Albumin and lasix had been given to increase urine output.
IV Vanco and levaquin were stopped on pod 6.
Trophic tube feeds were started.
He pulled out his feeding tube on [**1-8**].
Tube feeds were adjusted per nutrition.
He experienced diarrhea when feedings were cycled so, continuous feedings were resumed.
He required a 1:1 sitter briefly to prevent further inadvertant removal of the feeding tube.
This responded to fluid bolus and po lasix was stopped.
Two units of PRBC were transfused with a hct increase to 31.
The JP drains were removed as output decreased.
The Roux tube was capped after cholangiogram on [**1-5**] that showed Roux tube located in the jejunum, no opacification of biliary tree was likely due to partial withdrawal of the tube into jejunum.
Immunosuppression continued with cellcept 1 gram [**Hospital1 **], tapering prednisone and prograf based on trough levels.
He may have had increased levels due to some diarrhea that he experienced on [**1-13**] and [**1-14**] that resolved with resuming continuous tube feeds vs. cycled tube feeds.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for assist with management of hyperglycemia (due to the steroids) that started immediately postop in the SICU when he required an insulin drip.
This was switched to a sliding scale and later Lantus insulin was added.
