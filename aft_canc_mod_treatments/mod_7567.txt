DDx for ARF included compression of renal veins from ascites (abdominal compartment syndrome), prerenal ARF (high spec gravity on UA) [**3-4**] poor PO intake and/or third-spacing (due to malignancy causing exudative ascites; hypoalbuminemia also decreasing intravascular oncotic pressure), less likely ureteral/renal obstruction from mets (would need to be bilateral to cause Cr bump).
Pt had K of 6.9-7.2 on admission without any EKG changes; he received insulin/D50, calcium gluconate, and Kayexalate x2.

We have corrected these problems with IV fluids and medications and now your potassium level is normal, your blood pressure has improved and your kidneys are functioning back at your baseline.
You underwent a biopsy under CT guidance for furthing testing on your tumor.
The following changes have been made to your medications: STOP: Lisinopril, Tamsulosin because both medicines can lower your blood pressure  START: Furosemide 20mg by mouth daily to decrease potassium levels  Your potassium level was mildly elevated the day you left.
