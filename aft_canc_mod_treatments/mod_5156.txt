[**2176-9-25**] NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: INDICATIONS:  65-year-old man status post ventricular catheter replacement.
Status post ventricular catheter placement with appropriate positioning.
A sella MRI with gadolinium should be obtained for further evaluation.
The integrity of the sinuses cannot be determined on this head CT and a coronal sinus CT should be obtained for evaluation of this region.
Unchanged position of right transfrontal ventriculostomy catheter with interval decrease in pneumocephalus.
[**10-8**] CT head without contrast FINDINGS: As before, there is a right frontal ventriculostomy catheter with the tip in the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
There has been continued evolution in the attenuation pattern of the blood.
Ventriculostomy catheter is unchanged in position.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
A right PICC line terminates in the SVC.
A ventricular drain catheter courses down the right neck, and traverses the abdomen to terminate probably within the right mid abdomen, however, the tip of the catheter is off the area imaged.
A PEG tube is seen within the stomach.
IMPRESSION: Lines and tubes as described above.
Interval placement of PEG tube within the stomach.
Note is made of a VP shunt in the anterior aspect on the right side of the abdomen.
There is a PEG tube placed with bumper abutting the anterior gastric wall.
Normal-appearing PEG placement in the anterior wall of the stomach.
Note made of NG tube as well as VP shunt.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-24**], where he was admitted to the neurosurgical intensive care unit, was intubated, an an intracerebral drain was placed, followed by a VP shunt for persistent hydrocephalus.
He responded nicely to hydrocortisone 50 mg IV tid and has been hemodynamically stable now for several days with SBP from 110 - 130.
# ICH: s/p VP shunt (sutures removed [**10-15**]).
The patient had possible seizure activity [**10-8**] in the setting of a subtherapeutic dulantin level, for which he underwent a dilantin load.
He is a poor anticoagulation candidate, given his recent intraventricular hemorrhage and fall risk, and, therefore, anticoagulation was not initiated.
# Adrenal insufficiency: changed [**10-17**] from hydrocortisone 50 mg IV tid to prednisone 10 mg po qam and 5 mg po qpm.
Has not needed any furosemide since transfer to medicine  # Hematuria: He had several episodes of hematuria during his hospital course but this was thought to be [**2-1**] bladder/urethra trauma from the foley.
Hct 28 on discharge  # Schizophrenia: continue olanzapine, benztropine for prevention of EPS?
(was taking on admission)  # FEN: continue TF with PEG, replete lytes prn, failed speech and swallow eval - speech and swallow video eval should be repeated in one month to see if he could begin to tolerate po - s/p PEG placement [**10-10**]  # Contact: third party guardian [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 68736**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 46208**], cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 68735**] (best number).
