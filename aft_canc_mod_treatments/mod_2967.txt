Admission Date:  [**2131-5-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-7-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-12-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Latex / Adhesive Tape / Magnesium Sulfate / Cyclosporine  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: mini-MUD non-myeloablative transplant with campath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar Puncture Intubation CVVHD  History of Present Illness: 38 year old female with relapsed Nodular-Sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p autoSCT being admitted for a nonmyelablative (mini) allogeneic transplant from a MUD.
She has had chronic sciatic pain for which is on narcotics and that may have been a little worse today.
The patient initially was treated with Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine with subsequent disease recurrence.
Transplant was deferred at that time, and the patient received four cycles of CEPT.
She also received radiation therapy as part of initial treatment for six weeks.
She was then treated with CEPP chemotherapy.
She had a variable response to CEPP and was started most recently on Rituxan and Vinblastine and then just completed 3rd course of ICE.
Splenectomy in [**2126**].
She was on Coumadin for a period of time but this has been held due to her low platelet count.
The tips of bilateral central venous lines project over the SVC.
The findings are potentially concerning for leukoencephalopathy, although, in the appropriate clinical setting, could represent subacute-to-chronic borderzone infarcts.
MRI of the brain without and with gadolinium is recommended for further evaluation.
[**6-15**] MR brain w/ gad IMPRESSION:  White matter edema in the left frontal region, predominantly posteriorly.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 38 year-old female with refractory and recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma, status post auto-[**Month/Year (2) 3242**] in [**2128**], asplenic, and status post multiple chemotherapeutic regimens, s/p Mini allo-MUD [**Year (4 digits) 3242**] on [**2131-5-22**].
Her conditioning regimen consisted of Campath, fludarabine, and Cytoxan.
Her POC remained in place during her transplant given her history of chest wall edema and the risk of poor healing.
She was initially started on Cyclosporine for GVHD prophylaxis but she subsequently developed ARF requiring HD so this was stopped and high-dose Methylprednisolone was started in place.
The pt was also started on clotrimazole, nystastin, and ursodiol for prophylaxis and given a dose of aerisolized pentamadine and then bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
During the [**Hospital **] hospital course, methylrednisolone was tapered due to concerns for steroid induced myopathy contributing to pt's respiratory failure.
Possible contributing steroid induced myopathy was considered and methylprenisilone was tapered.
The pt had no increased secretions suggestive of infection, however completed a course of vancomycin and cefipime for empiric tx of VAP and was placed on voriconazole for fungal coverage.
The trach placement was also put on hold as the family had decided to make the pt [**Name (NI) 3225**].
The pt was started on acyclovir, bactrim for empiric toxo treatment.
The pt never fully recovered to her baseline mental status in spite of sedation weaning as tolerated.
ARF: [**12-28**] cyclosporine which caused HUS/TTP.
The pt was placed on pheresis X 4 days with positive results.
HD catheter was placed by renal and CVVHD was subsequently begun to help remove fluid off pt as BP tolerated.
Hypothyroidism: on IV levothyroxine during hospital stay.
Breast pain: before intubation, she complained of chronic L breast swelling, erythema and pain; thought to be secondary to LN involvement and chest-wall mass; inflammation swelling seemed to correlate to volume status.
FEN: Pt switched to TPN once intubated with electrolytes repleted in TPN.
PPx: No heparin SC given [**12-28**] thrombocytopenia, on pneumoboots, PPI.
Dispo: Given pt's grave prognosis, high tumor burden, lack of further treatment options, and persistent respiratory failure, a family meeting led by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was held in which the family decided to make the pt [**Name (NI) 3225**].
