No acute pulmonary disease   Brief Hospital Course: 31 year-old female admitted day + 231 status post matched allogeneic transplant for [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosome negative ALL in remission, with febrile neutropenia, no clear source.
ONCOLOGY: ALL/Pancytopenia: Patient had allo transplant ~240 days prior to admission but was found to have low counts and found to have graft loss.
Patient had stem cell transplant from  brother (donor) [**3-16**] and had pre-treatment with ATG, fludarabine and cytoxan.
She received stem cells on [**2142-3-16**].
She was discharged on cyclosporin 225 PO BID.
This will need to tapered down in the hopes of getting graft v leukemia effect.
A bone marrow should be performed within the next [**2-5**] weeks.
Receives pentamidine treatment monthly and received last dose while inpatient on [**2142-4-3**].
Patient was put on empiric antibiotics with cefepime and daptomycin (vancomycin allergy and Red Man's), as well as restarted on prophylactic fluconazole and acyclovir.
When she continued to spike, caspofungin was added.
Viral washings x 2 were sent for rapid respiratory antigens and were negative x 2.
IVIG 55,000 mg over 2 days was administered to help fight off infectious process.
Flagyl was added for a couple of days d/t concern for C.diff, but C.diff negative x 2 and this was stopped.
Her central line was removed and a new line was placed.
She again was afebrile for a few days, but spiked again so Aztreonam and Linezolid were added.
While patient continued to spike temperatures she remained clinically stable so antibiotics were pulled back.
We were initially worried about a line infection and she was started on daptomycin.
Daptomycin was stopped because of concern for drug fever.
There was discussion of this being serum sickness (2 weeks after receiving ATG) because complement levels were progressivly going down.
At the same time as being on her antibiotics, the patient was also started on solumedrol 60mg [**Hospital1 **] and tapered down over 10 days to prednisone 20 [**Hospital1 **] on discharge.
She was continued on amlodipine adn then metoprolol for control of her rate and BPs.
Ambisome could have caused some LFT abnormalities, but LFTs trended down while the patient remained on amiodarone.
She was given immodium with some relief of symptoms.
Her symptoms improved on solumedrol and she was therefore, started on Entocort.
She was also started on TPN for persistent nausea and poor PO intake.
She was quickly tapered off the TPN as she began to tolerate PO intake.
