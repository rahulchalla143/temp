The foley catheter was left in place and patient continued to make good urine output.
A foley was replaced and immediately voided over 1L of urine.
Urology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and they indicated that patient should be discharged with a foley and will be seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] in follow-up within the week to address what to do with the foley.
Atrial Fibrilation with Rapid Ventricular Response: Upon arrival in MICU Pt was noted to have rate of 130, found to be be in Afib w RVR, started on a dilt gtt and converted back to SR.
A cardiology consult was obtained and they recommended using metoprolol for the main rate control [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Pt was switched to metoprolol 75mg PO BID with PRN IV pushes.
As a result the evening dose of his metoprolol was changed to 50mg PO.
pt received cefepime and vanco in ED, and was continued on cefepime on arrival to MICU.
When his WBC quickly came back to normal after foley placement and bladder drainage, the ICU service decided that the elevated WBC wsa more likely due to stress from the bladder obstruction.
He were started on metronidazole and levofloxacin to treat suspected aspiration pneumonia with plans to complete an 8 day course if responsive.
When patient's WBC dropped after starting therapy and pt showed greater energy the day after therapy initiated, it was deemed acceptable to discharge him with 6 days of medication left to take as an outpatient.
His warfarin dose was reduced to 1mg PO daily while on the antibiotics due to pharmacy recommendations.

Consider starting PCP prophylaxis with bactrim or atovaquone (as patient has been taking prednisone daily since [**12-28**]).
PCP prophylaxis was started and pt was instructed to follow up with the dermatology clinic upon discharge.
Hypertension: Pt was intermittently hypertensive after ICU discharge with a couple isolated pressures >200 systolic for which IV hydralazine was given.
Because Mr. [**Known lastname 38030**] continued to run elevated blood pressures throughout much of the admission, an addtional anti-hypertensive (Losartan) was started to help with blood pressure control.

You were admitted to the hospital with kidney failure due to obstruction of your bladder, most likely by your prostate.
When after 8 hours you were unable to do so and your bladder contained a large amount of urine, we replaced a urine catheter.
We had to give you multiple doses of medications called metoprolol and diltiazem in order to control your heart rate.
You were briefly on a continuous infusion of diltiazem.
However, you should continue taking this medication at the perscribed doses as you have no symptoms with the slower heart rate while asleep.
Finally, you developed an elevated white blood cell count during your hospitalization and a chest xray showed a possible pneumonia in your right lung.
You were started on two anti-biotics called metronidazole and levofloxacin to treat you pneumonia - you will take these for a total of 8 days.
Your warfarin dose will also be reduced to 1mg by mouth each day while you are taking your antibiotics.
Your blood pressure was also high so we started an additional blood pressure medication called losartan.
