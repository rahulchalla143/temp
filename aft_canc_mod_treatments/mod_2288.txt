Of note ROS also positve for a cough and low grade fevers x1 week for which he was started on levoquin/inhalers on [**2158-10-16**].

This was treated with photopheresis, pentostatin, and Rituxan.
In [**4-/2158**] he was noted to have blasts in his peripheral blood counts and he was re-admitted for reinduction with VP-16 and Ara-C followed by a second allogeneic transplantation with bu/cy.
This transplant was complicated by b/l pleural effusions, pericarditis, and infection.
He was then admitted again on [**11-4**] with hemorrhagic cystitis which resolved with ditropan, pyridium and narcotics.

While in hospital patient with pericardial effusion s/p pericardiacentesis [**2158-10-27**], plueral effusions s/p thoracentesis x 2 most recent on [**2157-11-16**], MRSA bacteremia, GI bleed, increased LFTs.
Patient was started on cefepime/flagyl to cover for possible aspiration PNA.
CXR showed increase pleural effusion and patient underwent thoracentesis on [**2158-11-16**].
Patient got 40 IV lasix earlier in the day and put out 1L and O2Sat improved the previous night.
Cefepime, flagyl, and daptomycin were continued.
Throughout the code, pt was intermittently in PEA, VT/VF, and asystole, and treated appropriately with epinephrine, amiodarone, atropine, and defibrillation as indicated.
Consideration given to bedside pericardiocentesis due to recent evidence of pericardial effusion on TTE; however, pt remained in VF and asystole, and was deferred.
# PERICARDIAL EFFUSION - Etiology likely underlying Malignancy - On acceptance to the CCU, patient had pulsus [**2-28**] mmHg; JVP elevated at 9 cm .
# DYSPNEA - Etioplogy thought to be combination of bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion/echocardiographic tamponade - post procedure, no complaints of dyspnea - considered thoracentesis for diagnostic/therapeutic purposes .
Patient started on Flagyl and IV steroids (?
- Improved diarrhea in evening of [**10-27**] - CDiff neg x 3 - CMV negative on [**10-16**] - NPO, IVF - Repleteed electrolytes PRN - received Loperamide standing .
# AML - [**Month/Year (2) 3242**] followed - Continude Acyclovir/Levoquin/Ursodiol/Cyclosporine/ Diflucan/Prednisone - Monitored lytes - Allogenic transplant precautions - Monitored fever curve and CIS .
Pt then had acute episode of SOB of unclear etiology, and was intubated and transferred to the ICU for mechanical ventilation.
PICC line was pulled and cath tip grew MRSA.
- pt given 1 L NS, cefepime, and daptomycin at time of hypotension.
- transfused PRN - R leg CT was negative for bleed.
- cefepime and daptomycin were started (pt has PCN and Vanc allergy), given new fevers and decreased BP - stat portable CXR shows increased size of R pleural effusion, but no pneumothorax that could be causing hypotension - repeat echo did not show endocarditis or signs of tamponade .
Pt's diarrhea improved markedly, although gradually, with both steroid treatment and with flagyl.
flagyl re-started for 2 wk course of empiric therapy for C.dif, given radiologic findings and GI recommendations.
- pt was also treated with solumedrol and cyclosporine for presumed GVH - weekly CMV viral loads were negative - pt tolerated clear liquids with occasional toast, with only minimal diarrhea.
- CSA was continued throughout the admission, dosed by level .
- acyclovir/CSA were continued - continude ursodiol (was being held [**12-28**] difficulty taking pills) - allogenic x-plant precautions - monitored fever curve .
Although echo was consistent with tamponade, right heart cath did not show tamponade.
- pt underwent multiple thoracenteses during the admission, and 1 L serosanguinous fluid was removed each time - per pulm recs, both pleurodesis and pleurex were considered - CXR showed rapid reaccumulation of pleural effusions - pericardial effusion decreased in size according to last chest CT .
Unclear if pt has hx of htn (he says he was on metoprolol for "irregular heart rhythm.").
- metoprolol 25mg tid was given, with increased dose to 50 tid - nifedipine 10mg tid switched to nifedipine 30mg CR qd, and nifedipine then held in setting of hypotension .
- HIT Ab was negative - decreased platelets also might be secondary to flagyl (however continued flagyl given possible infectious colitis, and pt's intolerance of vanco) - towards the end of the admission, there was more concern for TTP given pt's rising LDH, decreasing platelets, and worsening mental status.
Stopping the pt's cyclosporine was considered, however the CSA was continued because pt was believed to be at risk for worsening GVH.
#) Edema: Pt had significant LE edema, likely secondary to low albumin, GVH, and high volume needed for antibiotics and TPN.
- avoided aggressive diuresis given concern for tamponade and sepsis .
