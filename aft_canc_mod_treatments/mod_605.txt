MICROBIOLOGY Urine culture [**2195-1-14**]- negative Blood culture [**2195-1-15**]- pending   Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE This is a 56 year old gentleman with DLBCL on R-CHOP and HD MTX, here for 3rd cycle of HD MTX, with course complicated by hypotension, Afib with RVR following MTX infusion.
He was treated with diltiazem briefly while hospitalized.
Afib with RVR - Patient has developed Afib with RVR in setting of HD MTX in the past, likely because of stress of high rate infusion of meds and fluids.
Unfortunately, fluid infusion could not be stopped as kidneys need to be continuously perfused in order to prevent MTX crystallizing in renal tubules.
During last admission, patient was started on metoprolol 25mg TID and during this admission, cardiology recommended diltiazem 30mg QID for added rate control.
Patient was also started on lovenox when he had his first episode of atrial fibrillation, and was continued on this during admission.
His heart rate was controlled with uptitration of metoprolol and he was started on diltiazem with uptitration of the dose to 90 qid with prn 10mg IV for heart rate > 120.
He was back in sinus rhythm after discontinuation of requisite IVF for methotrexate.
In addition, hypotension may have been related to calcium channel blocker and beta blocker used for rate control.
Overall outpatient oncology plan is to treat with CHOP/[**Hospital1 **] x 6 with HD MTX x 4 for CNS PPx.
He wa continued on leucovorin rescue.
Mtx levels were followed at 24, 48 and 72 hours and he was continued on bicarbonate @ 100 cc/hr.
Acyclovir and bactrim were initially held but restarted on discharge.
Patient continued on vitamin B6.
On enoxaparin 80 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **] as outpatient.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate Secondary: Diffuse large B-Cell Lymphoma Trilobar Pulmonary Embolisms/History of Deep Vein Thromboses Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
In the ICU, your heart rate and blood pressure was controlled with a medication called diltiazem.
Your heart rate improved as well as your blood pressures.
As your atrial fibrillation occurred in the setting of your methotrexate administration, cardiology felt you could continue to take your metoprolol at 25 mg two times a day while at home.
If you develop any symptoms of atrial fibrillation, specifically rapid heart rate, you may increase your metoprolol to 50 mg two times a day per the cardiology team, and please contact your cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] immediately.
SOME OF YOUR MEDICATIONS HAVE CHANGED STOP TAKING Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5 mg 3x a day START TAKING Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg 2x a day .
PLEASE CONTINUE TO TAKE THE REST OF YOUR MEDICATIONS AS PRESCRIBED.
