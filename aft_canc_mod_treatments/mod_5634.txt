As the tracing progressed, the encephalopathic features appeared more prominently in that there was greater suppression of electrical activity and longer suppressive bursts.
[**2160-6-15**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Indwelling support and monitoring devices remain in standard position.
Alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and bronchial cells.
She was initially treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin but she became more lethargic and so was switched to vancomycin/cefepime/flagyl.
She underwent a thoracentesis that removed transudative fluid, but due to increasing respiratory distress, she was sent to the MICU.
During her MICU course, she initially tolerated and remained stable on BiPAP, but then demonstrated progressive clinical deterioration in respiratory status, hypoxemia and required intubation and mechanical ventilation.
She also developed afib with RVR and was cardioverted successfully, but was continued on a heparin drip for anticoagulation, slated to continue for 1 month after cardioversion.
She developed altered mental status, decreased level of consciousness despite lactulose and rifaximin for possible hepatic encephalopathy.
Overall, she demonstrated continued clinical decline, with persistent respiratory failure, progressive hypotension requiring vasopressor support, oliguric renal failure, and persistent coma (despite discontinuation of sedatives for seveeral days).
Ultimatley, decision to move to focus care on comfort as primary goal was decided, consistent with patients previously expressed wishes.
