Allowing for differences in head position, overall stable appearance to right extra-axial fluid collection, compatible with an evolving subdural hematoma.
Stable position of ventriculostomy catheter, and stable configuration of the ventricles.
Cardiac monitor abnormalities are noted above.
The posterior oropharynx was anesthetized using lidocaine 1% spray, as well as both nostrils using lidocaine 1% spray and lidocaine 1% being given through the tracheostomy tube for local anesthesia.
Conscious sedation was administered intravenously using a total of Versed 2 mg and fentanyl 75 mcg.
A flexible bronchoscope was first introduced through the tracheostomy tube and advanced all the way down into the airway.
We then removed the flexible bronchoscope through the tracheostomy tube and advanced it through the right nostril all the way down into the airway where we first encountered severe supraglottic edema.
Then we were able to advance a flexible bronchoscope through the vocal cords where we saw significant degree of granulation tissue that was non- obstructing at that time, but causing significant narrowing of the tracheal lumen superior to where the tracheostomy tube stoma is.
The tracheostomy tube, at that point, was removed through the skin and full inspection of the area underneath was performed which did not reveal any active bleeding and the stoma itself appeared patent.
The tracheostomy tube was positioned between the third and the fourth tracheal limb deviated more towards the right lateral tracheal wall.
The flexible bronchoscope was then withdrawn after the tracheostomy tube was reinserted through the stoma and position confirmed.
We then performed a bronchoalveolar lavage and the right lower lobe and then removed the flexible bronchoscope and the procedure completed.
The patient tolerated the procedure well without any immediate complications.
IMPRESSION:  Hemoptysis in a patient who is status post percutaneous tracheostomy 2 weeks ago with the source being the carina.
PLAN:  We would recommend that the patient be started on proton pump inhibitor for supraglottic edema.
The patient will also require a long-term followed by Interventional Pulmonary for the possible need of granulation tissue debridement should he fail any attempts for capping of the tracheostomy tube for decannulation.
Patient was initially covered broadly with Vanc/Aztreonam/Levo for pulmonary source - given concern for lowering seizure threshold with Aztreonam, patient was switched to Vancomycin/Cefepime for healthcare associated pnuemonia and possible meningitis coverage (given Neisseria meningitides in sputum).
Neurology did not feel strongly about tapping his VP shunt or doing a lumbar puncture given antibiotics already started.
Infection control also did not feel healthcare providers and family need prophylactic treatment.
Per family he was following simple comands in his native language.
Likely [**1-13**] PNA given thick secretions, rhonchi on exam and CXR with ill-defined retrocardiac opactiy unchanged from CXR seen day prior to discharge.
Patient was treated with antibiotics per above.
Tube feeds were started.
On discharge he was satting 100% on trach mask at 35%.
Follow-up is schedule per Discharge planning sheet with interventional pulmonary.
On first day of admission, abnormal telemetry was noted and 12 lead EKG showed new STE in inferior leads; cardiology was called.
Given normal CE (completely flat troponins) and questionable patient description of chest pain, they recommended holding on heparinizing patient and catheterization.
Pravastatin (and other statins) were held in the MICU given elevated LFTs.
# Seizure d/o: Was persisently subtherapeutic on dilantin while here, level corrects to 4.2 based on albumin.
Neurology was consulted and patient switched to keppra and phenobarbital.
