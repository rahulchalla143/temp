Admission Date:  [**2114-9-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2088-3-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2091-4-26**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 23-year-old man with a diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia, who is being admitted for matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplant.
He was admitted to a local [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 14285**] hospital for workup, including bone marrow biopsy which was also reviewed in Pathology at [**Hospital1 188**], and demonstrated 100% cellularity with left shifted granulocyte hyperplasia.
Granulocytic hyperplasia increased ________________, and less than 5% leukoblasts, increased reticulin fibrosis.
Cytogenetic analysis confirmed translocation of chromosome 9 and 22, consistent with CML, chronic phase.
The patient's primary hematologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 38224**], referred the patient here to [**Hospital1 190**] for transplant evaluation, given his good performance status and health.
Hematologically, the patient has been controlled with oral hydroxyurea since diagnosis except for a drug-free interval to allow for sperm banking.
ALLERGIES:  Quinolones, in particular, erythroderma and azithromycin which led to gastrointestinal upset.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was given chemotherapy per protocol prior to transplant, which included Cytoxan, total body irradiation with MESNA for uroprotection, GVHD prophylaxis with cyclosporin and methotrexate, along with aggressive empiric antibiotic coverage, including intravenous acyclovir, intravenous fluconazole, along with aggressive mouth antibiotic coverage.
The patient's first fever spike was covered with intravenous cefepime.
The second spike, which was on [**9-19**], was covered with intravenous vancomycin, and the third fever spike, which occurred on [**9-20**], was covered with intravenous AmBisome.
The patient was then medicated with hydrocortisone and Benadryl, and received the rest of the AmBisome dose without further events.
The patient was given Peridex and continued on his anti-fungal regimen, however, this did not diminish the pain.
Hematology:  The patient's ANC diminished quickly after the patient finished his chemotherapy and got his donor cells.
The patient required multiple blood transfusions to keep his hemoglobin above 8 and hematocrit above 25.
Additionally, the patient required one unit of platelets on [**2114-9-20**], as his platelet level dropped to 9.
The patient responded appropriately to platelet transfusion.
Their recommendation was to send fungal immunoserology and to continue to try to administer intravenous AmBisome despite the patient's difficulty in tolerating this medication.
Caspofungin was considered, however, this medication was thought to be too hepatotoxic for this patient, and was known to interact with Cytoxan; therefore, this was thought to be a poor choice for broad spectrum anti-fungal coverage.
Matched unrelated bone marrow transplant  Please note that this is not a complete discharge summary, and that an addendum will be needed to complete it when the patient is actually discharged.
