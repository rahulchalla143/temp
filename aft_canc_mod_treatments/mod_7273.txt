So you were transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and started on antibiotics for sepsis, a severe infection of the blood.
They did recommend changing your blood pressure medicine to metoprolol and repeating an echo in one month.
You will need to complete a 3 week course of IV antibiotics for the sepsis.
Although the source of the infection was likely the skin rash, your port was removed in case the bacteria seeded it and when it was removed, it looked like infection may have been present in the area of the port.
You will need the drain managed by home nurses and the Surgery team as an outpatient.
You were also seen by Dermatology, who recommended continuing mupiricin ointment for the rash.
Prior to going home, you were given trastuzumab (Herceptin) chemotherapy for breast cancer.
Followup Instructions: Please call and make an appointment to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] next monday in clinic for wound evaluation and removal of the wound drain.
