She was started on Tamiflu, and Levofloxacin (first dose 3/17 at 2am).

There are no CT findings to suggest an empyema, but correlation with thoracentesis may be helpful if this diagnosis is being entertained clinically.
Brief Hospital Course: 20 yo female college student presents with multifocal pneumonia, with signif white-out of LLL, and also with involvement of RLL and RUL, without pleural effusions, despite levofloxacin which was started approx 36 hours prior to admission.
On arrival patient required a non rebreather to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%.
Patient was electively intubated for hypoxia, requiring high levels of sedation with midazolam and fentanyl, and ultimately paralysis with vecuronium.
Initially, she had oxygen saturations of 80% on mechanical ventilation.
Her ventilator oxygen concentration was steadily decreased, and her tidal volumes were decreased and respiratory rate was increased with the goal of ARDSnet low tidal volume ventilation.
Over the following days, her FiO2 and PEEP were gradually weaned down.
Her tongue swelling resolved with a three day course of IV steroids, and she was successfully extubated on [**4-13**].
She was treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
On day 8, CTX was discontinued as patient had persistent low grade temps and ID felt that CTX could be causing drug fever.
Antibiotics were then stopped and the patient remained subsequently afebrile and stable from a cardiopulmonary standpoint.
She was assessed by physical therapy in the hospital and will not need home oxygen in order to conduct her daily activities.
