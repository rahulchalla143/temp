Subcutaneous fluid stranding around the right shoulder and scapular region incompletely imaged.
Endotracheal tube terminates 3.6 cm above the carina.
A NGT tube is in place that terminates below the gastroesophageal junction and beyond the inferior margin of the film.
Multiple epinephrine injections were attempted at base of clot.
Increasing opacification of LUL is probably a combination of asymmetric residual edema and atelectasis following tracheal extubation.

Brief Hospital Course: ONCOLOGY SERVICE COURSE [**3-12**] - [**3-18**]: 86 yo male, h/o CAD s/p stenting, SVT s/p PPM, with recently diagnosed bronchogenic lung cancer with mets to spine, admitted from [**Hospital3 **] with change in mental status, rash, and right upper extremity swelling.
Overmedication was also a possibility, per daughter, he has been getting PRN morphine IR ATC in addition to standing SR prior to admission.
Pain medications were minimized.
CXR with resolving PNA, and repeat after hydration showed interstitial process .
Squamous Cell Lung CA: was initially undergoing palliative XRT for spine metastasis, and on steroids.
[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]:  [**Date range (1) 38624**] Mr. [**Known lastname 26453**] is an 86 yo male with h/o CAD s/p stent, SVT s/p pacer, AAA repair, recently diagnosed metastatic lung CA who is transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with coffee-ground emesis x 2 days and dropping HCT.
Patient underwent emergent endoscopy early on [**3-15**] which showed large blood clot visible in duodenal bulb- protruding from pylorus.
Multiple epinephrine injections were attempted at base of clot.
Zenker's diverticulum noted-making esophageal intubation difficult.
Pt kept intubated [**2-14**] to tenuous status and difficulty of intubation.
Central line placed and patient started on vanc and zosyn.
NG tube found to have threaded through perforated small bowel, w/ significant leakage of GI contents.
Patch procedure was performed, peritoneal washout, placement of J and G tubes.
Patient quickly became hypotensive after the surgery to SBP of 78, aggressivly resusitated w/ fluids receiving 6L.
Decreased steroids as part of taper, received stress dose in OR.
Continued vanc/meropenem for coverage of GI infectious catastrophy in ICU setting.
2) Hemodynamic Instability:  Patient required significant fluid resuscitation following the OR, with now adequate blood pressures.
Pt Intubated for endoscopy, was difficult to intubate so remained intubated overnight in case that further intervention was required.
Plan to continue vanc and meropenem; hold off on extubation for now; continue to adjust vent settings w/ ABG in response to metabolic derangements; will switch propofol to fentanyl/midazolam, titrate up for better sedation.
Plan to continue to trend Cr and renaly dose all meds .
Plan to rehydrate + IV digoxin load for rate control; cardiology felt rhythm to be afib with ectopy and believed pacer to be functioning adequately; nature of pacer firing different following OR, and was turned off during procedure, EP to interrogate pacer to see if firiting adequatly .
6) Squamous Cell Lung CA:  Stage IV disease with known metastates to vertebrae.
Plan to continue decamethasone 4mg [**Hospital1 **], and down titrate to 2mg; no role for chemotherapy in critically ill patient.
7) Coronary Artery Disease: currently stable.
Plan to discontinue ASA, Plavix in the setting of active GIB; hold Nifedipine in the setting of HD instability; rise in troponins likely from demand ischemia w/ renal failure, as ratio not elevated; continue to trend cardiac enzymes, no evidence of MI on EKG.
SURGICAL SERVICE COURSE [**3-18**] - [**3-26**] On [**3-18**], pt underwent an emergent exploratory laparotomy w/ repair of a perforated duodenal ulcer (please refer to operative note for details).
NEURO: Patient was maintained on adequate pain control post-op with fentanyl and percocet elixir.
CV: Post-op his CV status was stable and did not require any pressors during his initial stay in the TSICU.
He was restarted on ASA and plavix but then stopped after further discussions with team given his recent perforated ulcer.
He was maintained on SQH post-op.
On [**3-25**], he began exhibiting tachypnea and respiratory distress.
He was transferred to TSICU and there is cardiac function rapidly declined requiring ionotropic support.
Cardiology was called to help with further cardiac management.
Resp: Post-op patient was kept intubated but he weaned off the vent progressively and was extubated on [**2161-3-19**].
He had nebulizer treatments and aggressive chest PT by nursing.
He remained in the TSICU for extra pulmonary care and he was maintained on supplemental oxygen of 2L NC when he was transferred to the floor on [**3-24**].
He responded briefly to lasix IV but continued to be in respiratory distress.
GI: Post-op he was started on J-tube feeds and was tolerating them well.
He was maintained on IV PPI throughout his post-op course.
GU: He had a Foley catheter post-op and was auto-diuresing well.
ID: He was continued on vancomycin and meropenem post-op until [**3-22**] when they were d/c'd.
He was continued on fluconazole given yeast from his intra-op peritoneal swabs.
This was changed to caspofungin after blood cultures returned w/ [**Female First Name (un) **] (TORULOPSIS) GLABRATA.
ENDO: He was maintained on a dexamethasone taper post-op.
Medications on Admission: Atenolol 25 mg, Lipitor 20 mg, Plavix 75, Decadron 6 mg [**Hospital1 **], Morphine SR 60/60 mg, Morphine IR PRN, Nifedipine 30 mg [**Hospital1 **], Protonix 40 mg, ASA 325 mg, Senna/Colace/Dulcolax   Discharge Medications: Patient expired  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Delirium 2.
CAD s/p stenting in [**2155**], on ASA and plavix 2.
