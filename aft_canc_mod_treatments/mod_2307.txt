Today, the pt was intubated for Port placement and because of the concern of worsening airway status after initiation of chemo the patient remains intubated.
By immunohistochemistry, the atypical cells are diffusely immunoreactive for LCA (CD45), as well as Pan-B cell marker CD20.
Overall, the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings are of a high-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Right-sided central line tip seen within the atrium.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION PERIPHERAL SMEAR:  (1120B dated [**2199-2-4**]) Smear quality is acceptable.
Red cells show anisopoikilocytosis with occasional red cell fragments and microcytes.
As the pt's dyspnea and tachypnea worsened, he was prophylactically intubated for airway protection due to the risk of his Burkitt's lymphoma compromising his airway during his initial treatment.
He did well on his [**Hospital1 **]  (received 5 days of [**Hospital1 **] R, and 2 doses of intrathecal ara C) therapy and the tumor shrunk significantly.
On chemotherapy day 4, the patient was doing well and tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial w/out problem.
He received treatment with rituxan [**2-8**].
His tumor responded well to chemotherapy and his tumor lysis labs were checked per protocol w/out observed abnormalities.
He should continue allopurinol for 3 days post discharge.
He can take oxycodone for bone pain.
He will also need to complete a 10 day course of levofloxacin 500mg po qd.
Discontinued a week prior to admission as he had drug rash after starting multiple medications - likely etiology was bactrim rather than anti-retrovirals.
