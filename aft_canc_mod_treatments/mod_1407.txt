Has restrictive (charcot-[**Doctor Last Name **]-tooth, left hemidiaphragmatic weakness s/p plication, right upper lobectomy, on CPAP at home at night) and obstructive (COPD) components.
Flagyl was added and he responded well with decreasing WBC and decreased respiratory distress.
He underwent tracheostomy and was able to tolerate minimal pressure support by the time of discharge on PSV 5/5 for period of time and allowed to rest on higher pressure support.
He received steroids for his COPD and which has now been tapered off.
His vanc, levo, flagyl will be continued unitl  [**2158-3-19**].
Given his reestrictive disease (charcot-[**Doctor Last Name **]-tooth, left hemidiaphragm disease, and new right lobectomy) he will liklely need longterm support with ventilation.
## sedation - did well with haldol standing order.
# Hypotension - he was received on pressors, but these were rapidly titrated off and he maintained good blood pressures.
He was given a short course of stress dose steroids (hydrocort 50mg qid both for his hypotension at the OSH and his COPD exacerbation).
He was started on a beta blocker, aggressive statin, ASA.
# Lung cancer-Stage 2-poor prognosis with 20-30% chance for cure with surgery alone.
