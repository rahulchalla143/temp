Pt given benadryl 50 mg, lasix 20 mg, lopressor 5 mg, NTP, tylenol, unasyn 3 gmn, toprol 200 mg, lisinopril 40 mg, and 1 unit prbcs.
became progressively more dyspneic c RR 40s requiring 6 L NC to maintain normal O2 sats.
Received lasix 20 IV x 1 and atrovent nebulizer treatment with good response.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: ONC HX: 65-year-old with renal cell carcinoma diagnosed in [**2085**], status post right nephrectomy.
After radiation therapy to the left humerus, he received high dose IL-2 x 1 in [**2100-5-6**].
He also has received a CyberKnife treatment to his left arm mass.
He began treatment with Avastin off protocol, starting [**2101-12-5**].
His Avastin was stopped secondary to concerns of poor wound healing.
It was also decided to hold off on radiation treatments for this reason.
PMH: # metastatic renal cell cancer # hypertension secondary to Avastin and Sutent # cerebral aneurysm, resulting in lack of smell and taste # recent admit for cellulitis possibly c/b osteomyelitis  Social History: 50-pack-year smoking history.

The pt's course was then c/b thrombocytopenia and cholestasis and low fibrinogen, fevers, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, increasing coags, worsening renal failure, and increasing bilirubin.
He was later found to have a Pseudomonas UTI on [**1-29**] along with a new rash and sore throat.
He was maintained and subsequently discharged home on Nystatin S&S.
Per ID recommendations, aztreonam was changed to ciprofloxacin (Pseudomonas is pan-sensitive).
Has tolerated transfusions well on [**2-20**], and [**2-1**] (did not receive pre-transfusion fluids during last transfusion).
High dose Epogen was also started during this admission.
Initially on meropenem and cipro (with vanco and Flagyl, given febrile and neutropenic).
Antibiotics narrowed to meropenem, then changed to aztreonam on [**2-1**] given more distant from beta-lactams), then changed on [**2-2**] to ciprofloxacin (given development of rash).
Fevers initially thought to be secondary to drug effect (Unasyn); antibiotics (Unasyn/Vanco) were discontinued on [**1-20**].
Started meropenem, cipro (both for Pseudomonas), vancomycin and metronidazole (additional coverage given neutropenic).
Vancomycin d/c'd [**1-29**].
Acute renal failure On admission, creatinine was 1.0, but he developed acute renal failure after CTA (~1.5).
Went into further ARF on [**1-18**] (peaked at 2.9), improved after antibiotics discontinued.
Renal consulted [**1-20**], concerned for AIN from Unasyn vs. ATN from vanco vs. pigment induced renal failure.
By the time of discharge, pt's creatinine returned to normal.
Bone marrow suppression (from Sutent vs. urosepsis) was most likely cause; initially may have been secondary to an autoimmune process, as platelets improved on steroids (but steroids need to be weaned given infection and recent neutropenia).
Started steroids [**1-23**], tapered to 20 mg daily on [**1-28**].
He has been given ethacrynic acid 50 mg IV DAILY for diuresis given likely Lasix allergy.
He had minimal bowel sounds, but continued to have bowel movements.
Renal Cell Carcinoma Considering Avastin as outpatient.
Went back on Sutent with BP's as high as 210 systolic; developed hypotension (90's systolic) on [**1-29**], when urine culture grew Pseudomonas.
Oxycodone for pain management, outpatient follow up.
Enzymes elevated on admission, cards consulted, decided that it was in the setting of demand ischemia (given increased BP) and no heparin required.
Improved s/p 3 week antibiotic course (before abx were d/c'd).
