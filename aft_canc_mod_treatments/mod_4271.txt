He was started on treatment for HAP with Vancomycin, levo, zosyn.
He was also started on Bactrim 3DS tabs TID and prednisone 40mg PO BID.
The patient's respiratory status remained tenuous during the first 5 days of his admission, but then it began to improve with his treatment and he is currently on NC 4L with an oxygen saturation of 100%.
The plan is to continue Bactrim DS 3 tabs 4 times a day for 21 days (D1, [**2102-11-14**]).
The patient is being discharged on prophylactic Bactrim DS 1 daily.
However, patient had a PEA arrest requiring intubation on [**2102-11-23**].
Therefore, he was placed on isolation room.
Therefore, he was kept on mechanical ventilator for respiratory support until [**2102-11-30**] after a day tolerating pressure support.
Very shortly after extubation, patient had a witnessed aspiration of vomitus with initial ABG showing hypoxemia pH 7.49 pCO2 37 pO2 74 HCO3 29 but with improved O2Sat with face mask and repeat ABG shows pH 7.51 pCO2 39 pO2 91 HCO3 32.
At time of transfer pt was satting well with Nasal Cannula 3L and on Day 19/21 for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 31304**].
He will be continued on prednisone 20mg PO Daily after completion of PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 31304**].
It occurred after administration of oxycodone and after his family left and he became disoriented.
He was started on a heparin drip for a few days.
However, he was switched back to heparin gtt after the PEA arrest.
Therefore, patient underwent placement of IVC filter.
Heparin drip was held briefly also because of pancytopenia (including dropping platelet counts).
Pt was switched to lovenox on day of ICU transfer.
Lovenox dosage was reduced by 10% (90 mcg to 80 mcg q12H) due to continued hematuria after traumatic Foley insertion or self discontinuation of Foley catheter.
(5) Hematuria:  Initially, this was felt to be due to traumatic Foley insertion in ICU; continued after patient self discontinued consistent pulling on Foley catheter.
Lovenox decreased by 10%, expect hematuria to improve as thrombocytopenia continues to improve.
Started on banana flakes for stool bulking and given imodium as c. dificile very unlikely.
This was resolved by time of discharge, flexiseal removed 3 days prior to discharge.
(7) Positive AFB on BAL:  Patient had positive AFB from BAL and was placed on respiratory isolation.
Gene probe amplification was negative for TB so was taken off of respiratory precautions.
After the PEA arrest and cooling/rewarming protocol, patient's hyponatremia improved and resolved on continued free water restriction even prior to initiation of Lasix on [**2102-11-28**].
(9) Glioblastoma Multiforme:  Neurological status stable, he has been continued on his home doses of carbidopa-levodopa, valproic acid, gabapentin and has been given stress dose steroids as described above.
Patient will be readmitted in 2 weeks time after pt regains strength at [**Date Range **] for treatment with Avastin per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**].
Patient started on ritalin during admission for improved energy and alertness.
Patient also started on thiamine during admission.
bactrim was not stopped because of need to treat PCP.
Possibly secondary to underlying infectious process as it is now trending up and still on Bactrim and other antiepileptic meds that can cause thrombocytopenia, however, underlying cause still unclear.
Bactrim was not discontinued and rash now significantly improved, likely secondary to artic sun cooling, it began after use of the cooling pads and has since resolved with no changes in medications.
It was unclear whether in the setting of the rash and thrombocytopenia this was related to bactrim treatment.
pt was continued on Bactrim and petechiae resolved.
