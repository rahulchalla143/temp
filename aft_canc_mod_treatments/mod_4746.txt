Resection of third and fourth portions of duodenum and proximal jejunum with duodenojejunostomy reconstruction.
Upper endoscopy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 83752**] is a very pleasant 54-year-old gentleman who presents to the general surgery service for a duodenal resection and re-anastamosis.
IMAGING: [**2131-3-29**] MRCP: WETREAD - The pancreatic duct in the body and tail show no abnormality; the pancreatic duct in the head and periampullary region cannot be assessed due to susceptibility artifact from multiple sutures  Micro/Imaging: [**2131-3-22**] H.pylori equivocal by EIA; Per Micro, repeat test in 2 weeks.

He was intubated in TICU, and returned to OR on [**2131-3-13**] for abdominal washout and evacuation 4L of purulent fluid.
His post-op course was complicated by atrial fibrillation requiring amiodarone gtt and diltiazem gtt for rate control.
On POD 19 from the initial duodenal carcinoma resection ([**2131-3-21**]), he developed coffee ground NGT aspirates that progressed to bloody output with a 5 point Hct decrease.
He was transferred to SICU for further management at that time.
GI injected epinephrine as well as applied four endoclips with partial hemostasis at the anastomotic site.
However, a small but significant amount of residual bleeding was present, so the patient returned to the OR for the 3rd time for oversewing of the anastamosis, as well as J-tube placement.
During this time, he was additionally started on [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI and aggressively resuscitated with IV fluids and blood products (including trasfusion of 5U PRBCs, +antibody positive screen) as needed.
H.pylori Ab was sent in order to evaluate for a possible ulcer as the cause his upper GI bleed, which was equivocal (per Micro, repeat testing should be done in 2 weeks --[**2131-4-5**]).
His hematocrit remained stable after oversewing of the anastamosis and was 29 at discharge.
The patient's duodenal resection was additionally complicated by developement of a pancreatic leak, as noted by milkly white drainage from JP drain with remarkably high amylase level ([**Numeric Identifier **] at discharge).
The patient was started on Octreotide to treat this.
MRCP with secretin stimulus showed normal response to secretin with expected transient caliber change in the pancreatic duct in the head and body, although the study was limited due to artifact from surgical sutures.
During his hospitalization, the patient was given TPN for nutrition, and after J-tube placement was started on tube feeds, which he tolerated well.
He was discharged NPO with on-going tube feeds through the J-tube.
The patient's pain was treated with dialudid PCA during most of his hospitalization.
Despite difficulty with A. fib with RVR during this hospitalization as noted above, his rate was well-controlled on Metoprolol at time of discharge.
