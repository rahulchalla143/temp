She was transitioned to PO diltiazem and beta-blockers were titrated to obtain adequate rate control.
She remained in a-fib, and given the patient's desire to avoid anticoagulation, as well as her fall risk, it was decided by the surgical and cardiology teams not to have the patient on anti-coagulation except aspirin.
