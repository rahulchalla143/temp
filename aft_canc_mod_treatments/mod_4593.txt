Admission Date:  [**2180-8-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2180-8-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2120-4-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**] Chief Complaint: CC:[**CC Contact Info **] Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IVC filter placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 60 year old man with lung cancer with brain metastases previously on anticoagulation for [**Hospital **] transferred to the MICU from the SICU in the setting of arrythmias, most prominently tachyarrythmias, who originally presented to medical care on [**8-17**] late morning after being found by his family, lying down on the sidewalk outside of his home, minimally responsive.
He reportedly started the flight being AOx3 and following commands and then deteriorated into lethargy and minimal responsiveness.
He was intubated for airway protection.
Of note, his INR was 3.7 on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] consistent with coumadin taken regularly at home for known PE in [**2179-12-30**].
He received 2 units of FFP and vitamin K. .
An IVC filter was placed on [**8-21**].
Past Medical History: Stage IV lung cancer with brain metastases diagnosed [**9-5**] after episode of seizures, s/p R craniectomy [**9-5**] for tumor resection, s/p chemo/radiation; oncologist [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1528**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Hospital1 6136**]), rad onc [**Location (un) **] ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **]); per daughter, little effect of chemo/rads, oncologist said emphasis should be on quality of life at this point PE diagnosed in [**1-7**] (on coumadin), diagnosed by routine CT scan, was evidently asymptomatic at that time Hyperlipidemia NIDDM GERD Bipolar disorder diagnosed in [**2174**] after a psych hospitalization for mania, has been on several meds; stopped meds and was rehospitalized; since then has been on seroquel alone Seizure disorder secondary to brain mets only .
He was intubated for a GCS of 7  at arrival and recieved profiline and FFP in ED.
On [**8-19**], the patient was extubated and placed on nimodipine for subarachnoid hemorrhage.
On physical exam, patient was awake, following commands, giving thumbs up and moving R>L.
On [**8-20**], cardiology was consulted for arrthymias seen on telemetry and nimoedipine was discontinued, as no vasospasm was seen on CTA.
Patient's mental status improved over the course of the admission, becoming more interactive, A&Ox2, able to state his address and birthday, following commands and moving all four extremities to command.
Neurosurgery followed the patient while admitted, with recommendations to hold the patient's Coumadin for (at least) 1 month as well as to continue seizure prophylaxis with Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Cardiology was consulted and recommended a low-dose beta blocker for rate control (metoprolol 12.5mg three times daily).
Cardiology was also concerned that additional anti-arrythmic intervention would increase his risk for bradycardia, of which the patient had only one concerning episode but which would ultimately likely be more problem[**Name (NI) 115**] than his well-perfusing tachycardia.
This mass may contribute to future respiratory compromise via obstruction or subsequent pneumonia--however, the patient remained stable from a respiratory stand-point throughout his hospitalization, with 02 saturations >95% on room air and without respiratory distress.
These procedures would require intubation with bronchoscopy.
Although he had no obvious source, with a negative UA and indeterminate CXR showing extensive left lung collapse and effusion, the patient was begun on coverage for ventilator associated pneumonia with IV Cefepime, Vanc, and Flagyl, given his increased risk from recent intubation.
He will continue this regimen at rehab.
He was started on a PM dose of Lantus (14 units) prior to discharge.
However, intensive glucose control may create sharp swings in glucose, could precipitate arrythmias so aggressive glucose control should be avoided.
This was achieved with Metoprolol 12.5mg TID, with the patient's blood pressure ranging from 114-132/60-80 on day of discharge.
Nutrition: The patient was evaluated by the speech and swallow with the recommendation to feed the patient thin liquids/soft solids with 1:1 supervision.

Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, or Ibuprofen etc.
If you were on a medication such as Coumadin (Warfarin), or Plavix (clopidogrel) prior to your injury, you may safely resume taking this on XXXXXXXXXXX.
If you haven been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam), you will not require blood work monitoring.
