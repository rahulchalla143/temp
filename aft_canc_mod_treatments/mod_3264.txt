You received broad spectrum antibiotics and stress dose steroids, but a full workup (including viral swabs, cultures, ECHO, and CT chest) were unrevealing.
CT chest showed resolving infiltrates and your symptoms improved so the antibiotics were switched to azithromycin for presumed bronchitis.
Your prednisone was increased due to presumed mild adrenal insufficiency.
The following medication changes were made: 1) Prednisone increased to 7.5mg daily 2) Azithromycin (antibiotic) started, to be completed as outpatient 3) Your lisinopril (blood pressure medication) and metoprolol were discontinued.
Do NOT resume these medications until speaking to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
