PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic [**Year (4 digits) 499**] cancer to the liver- possible candidate for trisegmentectomy with wedge resection (referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] secondary to rapidly progressing liver metastasis despite recent chemotherapy.
Status post sigmoid colectomy with low anterior resection on [**2178-9-23**] with one moderately differentiated and one poorly differentiated lesion with 11 out of 12 lymph nodes positive, status post adjuvant chemotherapy from [**11-9**] to [**6-10**] consisting of 5-FU plus leucovorin.
Tylenol p.r.n.
Vitamin B6 q.d.
LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC DATA:  Admission white count 9.5 increased to 16.4 during this admission, hematocrit 44.2 decreased to 34.9 during this admission, platelets 265 with a decrease to 85 over his hospital stay.
Troponin 0.16 following episode of hypotension.
Metastatic [**Month/Day/Year 499**] cancer:  The patient is status post 5-FU and leucovorin completed in [**6-10**], however, with rapid development of liver metastases on CT diagnosed prior to admission.
The decision was made that resection is not appropriate at this time given the two sites of metastatic disease.
Thus, Radiation Oncology was consulted with a plan to initiate palliative radiation for pain control.
The patient will likely also undergo further chemotherapy as an outpatient.
Pathologic vertebral body compression fracture:  The patient was started on MS Contin, which was titrated up to permit adequate mobility.
medication, the patient was initiated on palliative radiation.
However, this seemed to acutely worsen his back pain and his MS Contin was gradually titrated up.
In addition to narcotic analgesia, the patient received a dose of IV pamidronate on [**2179-10-27**] and was managed on Vioxx.
He was ultimately discharged on rofecoxib, OxyContin, and hydromorphone p.r.n.
He received IV steroids; however, these were discontinued the following day due to the confirmation of no cord compression, and the approval of Radiation Oncology for the absence of need for steroids with the initiation of palliative radiotherapy.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  The patient was noted to be unresponsive and hypoxic with saturations in the 80s on [**2180-10-30**].
Initial thought for narcotic overdose as the underlying etiology, thus the patient received one dose of Narcan with some improvement in his oxygenation and respiration.
However, he continued to be poorly responsive and agitated with a drop in his blood pressure following intubation, thus suspicious for sepsis secondary to possible aspiration pneumonia in the setting of narcotic analgesia and the patient's supine position, all necessary for control of his back pain.
The patient was initially managed with vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl; and continued on cefepime to complete a total of 10 days of antibiotics following a sputum culture revealing MSSA.
The patient's narcotic analgesia was titrated down prior to discharge.
He responded well to peripheral dopamine and IV fluids.
A central line was placed and he was continued on pressors for two days to maintain his blood pressure while on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
His antibiotics were narrowed to cefepime alone.
Prophylaxis:  Subcutaneous heparin, PPI, aspiration precautions.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Senna 8.6 mg 2 tablets p.o.
Rofecoxib 12.5 mg p.o.
Oxycodone SR 20 mg p.o.
Calcium carbonate 500 mg p.o.
Hydromorphone 1 to 2 mg p.o.
Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
