On admission she was started on a PPI twice per day, carafate slurry and placed on a clear liquid diet.
(25.5 to 36)  After the patient cleared her MTX therapy, she underwent a repeat EGD for reevaluation of continued melanotic stool as well as for biopsy.
Biopsy revealed HSV and she was started on Acyclovir 400mg 5x/day for 14days.
CNS lymphoma: Ms. [**Known lastname 107686**] is s/p several cycles of high-dose MTX and was due for MTX treatment on the day of admission, however treatment was initially held due to acute GI bleeding and recent neutropenia.
She was treated with Ceftriaxone as above for this.
ID was consulted and felt that she was cleared to begin MTX therapy once the remaining 3blood culture bottles remained negative for three days, making the source of the bacteremia less likely to be endocarditis.
She began HD MTX therapy with no signs or symptoms of toxicity.
She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**] on [**2176-8-21**] for an additional cycle of chemotherapy.
She was treated with ceftriaxone in the hospital and will continue on discharge to complete a course of 14 days (To be completed on [**8-18**]).
Given recent neutropenia and presence of 2 central lines, she was treated broadly with cefepime and vancomycin due to concern for sepsis.
She was given 2L of normal saline and 2U PRBCs in the ED.
She was switched from cefepime and vancomycin to ceftriaxone.
She is currently not undergoing active treatment for this cancer, despite the fact that it is likely contributing to current GI bleeding, as she has been consistently guaiac positive and has had melanotic stools in the past.
Once she is clear from a neurooncologic perspective, she should be evaluated by surgery for possible resection of colon CA.
Her medications were renally dosed and with rehydration, her creatinine trended down to 1.2. .
HTN:  Ms. [**Known lastname 107686**] is on metoprolol and amlodipine at NH.
Her anti-hypertensives were held on admission.
However, once she was stabilized her amlodipine was restarted with good response in blood pressure.
Her beta blocker was held throughout the hospitalization secondary to the GI bleed.
She was maintained on a sliding scale on this hospitalization.
Glaucoma: The patient was kept on her home eye drops for glaucoma.
