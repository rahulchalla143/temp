Limited findings are concerning for portal vein thrombus versus undetectable flow, but cannot be further clarified with ultrasound at the present time.
CXR ([**2168-9-7**]): Neg for PNA or effusions  Pending labs: spleen for pathology  Medication changes: none  The patient was admitted for observation after laparoscopic splenectomy that was converted to open.
An epidural was placed by the Acute Pains Service (APS) post-operatively for pain control which provided moderate pain relief.
This was removed and was briefly started on a dilaudid PCA.
However, she developed confusion and this was d/c'd and started on vicodin with IV morphine for breakthrough.
APS was paged and the epidural was removed and she was transferred to the SICU for observation and was started on Heparin drip.
A right IJ CVL was placed for access.
She received pre-splenectomy vaccinations in [**Month (only) **].
Heme/Onc was consulted to assist with management and transfusion requirements in patient post-splenectomy with history of thalassemia minor.
POD#4 she was transferred to the floor and was started on coumadin.
She was placed on regular diet and a morphine PCA for pain control.
POD#5 the foley was removed and she was voiding without difficulty.
She was transitioned to oxycodone and the PCA was stopped.
POD#6 the heparin drip was stopped and she continued on coumadin.
POD#7 her INR returned as 6.6 and all anticoagulation was held to allow her to drift back down.
The oxycodone was stopped because she was overly sedated and she was placed on scheduled Tylenol and PRN tramadol of which she only needed 1 dose.
She was discharged to rehab with appropriate follow up appointments with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from surgery and her oncologist.
She is going to receive 1mg coumadin tonight and should have her INR checked at rehab to titrate coumadin.
