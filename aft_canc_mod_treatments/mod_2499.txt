Started with Solmedrol 100 mg IV dose X 1.
Tumor lysis labs were followed q8hours without issue, and bicarb D5W 75 cc/hr was also given with allopurinol.
She was transferred to the oncology floor on day 1 s/p solumedrol infusion without issue.
She was started on CHOP therapy cycle one on [**2114-12-20**].
Pt required intermittent blood transfusions, although no plts transfusions, while counts were low.
Pt was kept NPO during the first 11 days of chemo over concerns that as her bowel mass shrunk she was at risk for perforation of the bowel.
Decision was made to give 2nd cycle of CHOP, plus rituxan, on morning of discharge ([**2115-1-4**]), because pt unable to receive rituxan at rehab center.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Pt had reported episode of Afib with RVR at NEBH before transfer.
On arrival in [**Hospital1 18**] ICU, pt was initially placed on diltiazem and had dose uptitrated to control rate.
Pt was switched to metoprolol and dose uptitrated to 100mg metoprolol tartrate [**Hospital1 **] to good effect.
At times pt would get dehydrated and HR would bump up but these times usually responded to small fluid boluses (500-1000mls NS.
No issues with initiation of chemotherapy but pt complained of intermittent back pain from old known compression fracture and was given one dose of IV dilaudid as at time had elevated LFTs and questionable renal function.
This cleared slowly over next three days, with the help of IV haldol.
# COPD: Pt with history of underlying lung disease of uncertain severity.
Initially pt was on 6L of nasal cannula in order to keep sats in low-mid 90s.
Increased frequency of albuterol and ipratropium and changed both to standing doses and nebs and resulting improvement in sats so that pt only required 2L NC to keep sats in low to mid 90s.
Due to concern for abdominal source, started initially on Cefepime and Metronidazole and then broadened to Vancomycin when fevers persisted.
# Diabetes Type II: Pt with history of DM II and on insulin at home.
Once TPN started, insulin was placed in TPN but sugars still high so started on NPH and uptitrated to 8u am / 8u pm with resulting sugars in mid 100s with 45 units regular insulin in TPN.
# Abdominal Wound: Ex-lap as part of DX at NEBH on [**12-10**].
General surgery at [**Hospital1 18**] saw pt 12 days later and removed staples.
