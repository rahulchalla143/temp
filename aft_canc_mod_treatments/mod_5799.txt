Peripancreatic stranding, with limited evaluation of pancreas due to lack of IV contrast.
Increase in size of low-density, perinephric fluid collection, with interval increase in number of air foci within the fluid collection following left percutaneous nephrostomy, while this may represent a urinoma, seroma or hematoma, superinfection cannot be excluded.
Interval improvement in multiloculated bilateral perinephric collection, with near complete collapse of the left posterolateral cavity containing a previously placed pigtail catheter in situ.
## Sepsis/pyelonephritis/peri-nephric abscess: When patient was admitted she had fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia with evidence of end organ dysfunction.
Her sepsis was likely due to a urinary source given her history, UA with bacteria, and appearance of left kidney.
On HD2 she had a percutaneous nephrostomy placed to decompress left ureter d/t obstruction with stone.
She was started on a cipro/cefepime antibiotic regimen.
Infectious disease was consulted on HD 8 and followed her through the course of her stay.
Despite the nephrostomy placement and antibiotics, her leukocytosis and intermittent fever resumed on HD11.
Antibiotics were changed to meropenem and vancomycin.
It revealed the abscess with the pigtail catheter was resolving, but that 2 other abscesses were present.
Although the imaging revealed a resolved abscess, her drain was still putting out 20-40ml of fluid/day.
Her vancomycin was stopped because she did not grow out MRSA and her meropenem was changed to ertapenem for ease of dosing.
According to ID, she will stay on this for 1-2 weeks after the pigtail catheter drain is taken out.
She was set up with home nursing care to help with the pigtail catheter drain to her perinephric abscess and the nephrostomy tube at home.
When her drain stops putting out, she is to have it clamped for a day.
There was no evidence of active bleeding with exception of small amount from nephrostomy drainage.
She had an INR of 1.8 on HD4 that was reversed with vitamin K.  Her anemia was microcytic, but iron studies did not reveal iron deficiency.
Her cipro was stopped d/t concern for medication causing hemolysis.
She will follow-up with hematology in clinic and discuss Epo and iron treatment as an outpatient.
Her ARF resolved after the nephrostomy tube was placed antibiotic therapy started.
These lab abnormalities resolved with treatment of urosepsis and IV hydration.
Patient has residual stone burden as was seen previously.
Urology put in her left percutaneous nephrostomy tube, ordered a urine gram stain and culture which grew out Strep Viridians.
Patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] as outpatient to discuss surgical management of her stones after her infection resolves.
The only positive blood cultures revealed organisms suggestive of skin contamination (propionibacterium and corynebacterium).
Patient was found to have hypernatremia (Na: 149) on HD [**1-3**].
With aggressive NS fluid resuscitation it resolved for the remainder of her hospital course.
## FEN: At the time of discharge patient no longer required IV fluids, was tolerating a normal diet, and oral medications  ## Prophylaxis: Patient had heparin injection for the majority of her stay.
## Code: DNR/DNI  ## Disposition: Patient discharged home with IV therapy, VNA for drain care and weekly lab draws, appointments with hematology, ID, discharge clinic, and her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].

You required drainage of your kidney and a nearby abscess and an extended course of antibiotics.
Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you have fever greater than 101, abdominal or back pain, bleeding or pain with urination, difficulties with your nephrostomy tube, or any new symptoms that you are concerned about.
* Iron: these pills will help your anemia and this course will be followed by the hematologists as well.
These medications can cause constipation, so make sure to eat fiber and take medicines like colace and senna to help with bowel movements.
