During hemodialysis, on [**2-7**], he had blood cultures drawn and was given vancomycin and gentamicin, and subsequently referred to the Emergency Department.
In the Emergency Department, he was given Lopressor for a heart rate in the 170s (irregular).
Subsequently, his blood pressure dropped to 54/palp, so he was started on a dopamine drip.
This was later changed to a Neo-Synephrine drip and the patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

Neck revealed left subclavian line in place (Hickman).
G-tube in place.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the right Port-A-Cath was removed due to purulent drainage being present.
Initial antibiotic coverage included vancomycin for a possible line infection, levofloxacin for the question of pneumonia, Flagyl for his history of Clostridium difficile, and gentamicin.
When the patient's urine cultures showed Escherichia coli resistant to gentamicin and quinolones, the levofloxacin and gentamicin was discontinued.
The patient was started on ceftriaxone on [**2-10**].
The patient's fevers defervesced, and he was gradually weaned off pressors by [**2-12**].
The patient required a diltiazem drip for rate control until [**2-12**] when he was transitioned to p.o.
The patient had a temporary hemodialysis catheter in place after the old line was removed.
A Hickman catheter was placed on [**2-11**], and the patient underwent hemodialysis on [**2-11**] and [**2-12**].
Improved control was obtained with the addition of oral diltiazem in addition to his Lopressor.
On [**2-13**], Flagyl was discontinued as there was no evidence that Clostridium difficile was involved in his current infection.
At this time, the plan is for ceftriaxone and vancomycin to be administered at hemodialysis for a total of two weeks of therapy.
His line swab from [**2-8**] showed mixed flora including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
