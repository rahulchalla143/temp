2 brothers and father died of MI.
Cortical defects involving the lateral aspects of both iliac bones, this is of uncertain significance, possibly related to prior bone donor sites or could be related to prior infection.
[**2183-9-2**] CXR: There is an increase  in the left lower lobe predominantly retrocardiac consolidation not fully imaged on the current chest radiograph suggesting worsening of infection and/or aspiration pneumonia.
On [**8-22**], he underwent resection of the 2.5 cm L cerebellar mass without neurologic complication.
He was started on decadron to minimize brain edema.
Over the next week after surgery, his nausea and vomiting was much improved, but he developed vocal cord paralysis with subsequent aspiration pneumonia and PEG tube placement (see below).
In terms of his cancer, it was felt that the patient could not being systemic therapy until he had recovered from his surgery and until his infection had resolved.
The pt will continue oral decadron until he is seen by the brain tumor clinic and further arrangements are made.
Unfortunately he again developed vocal cord paralysis after intubation for his neurosurgery on [**8-22**].
ORL saw him and recommended PPI [**Hospital1 **] and PEG placement for nutrition.
He received clears and pills through his tube for the first 24 hrs, then started tube feeds on [**9-5**] (started at 20 cc/hr, increase by 20cc q6 hrs to goal of 80 cc/hr).
He will continue his 2-week course of Zosyn until [**9-14**] (started on [**9-1**]).
# DM2: Pt is controlled with oral hypoglycemics at home.
In the setting of decadron use, he briefly needed insulin gtt for hyperglycemia, but was weaned from this on [**9-3**].
He was transfered to the floor on NPH plus humalog sliding scale, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs.
He will likely need to continue insulin while on decadron as an outpatient.
# Hypertension: Pt's BPs have been under control on this admission, so he has not been placed on his home antihypertensives.
This will need to be monitored at rehab, as he will likely need to be restarted on his BP meds in the future.
This is likely secondary to chronic disease given his Fe studies and normal B12 and folate levels.
