Cystoscopy & retrograde ureterogram   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 29-year-old G5 P1-1-3-2 thin African-American female with a large symptomatic fibroid uterus, complaining of prolonged menometrorrhagia as well as severe pelvic pain, who presented with severe anemia with a hematocrit of 25.
Given the source of anemia was likely due to her fibroid uterus, the patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells 1 day preoperatively, as well as 125 mg of Ferrlecit IV to try to improve her iron stores and blood supply.
The patient was counseled extensively and she opted for the preop transfusion and IV iron, and to proceed with the surgery.
