Due to her obesity and comorbidities, it was elected to treat her with definitive chemoradiotherapy and not involve surgery.
Given the fact that she has already had radiotherapy for her esophagus, repeat radiotherapy was not an option.
Palliative chemotherapy was the only option other than surgery.
She understands that this is an extremely risky procedure, given the fact that it is a salvage esophagectomy several years after chemoradiotherapy and her co-morbidities.
Admitted to the TSICU after undergoing esophagastrectomy, jejunostomy, and pylorplasty with j tube placement.
She was also maintained on neosynephrine and levophed throughout the case.
