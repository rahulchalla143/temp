IMAGING: -[**2158-6-24**] CXR:  FINDINGS:  There is a new left-sided PICC line with tip in the low SVC.
IMPRESSION:  Patent basilic and cephalic veins bilaterally, with diameters as described above.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 year-old gentleman with history of bladder cancer with bilateral ureteral stents, CKD Stage IV, PVD s/p b/l LE amputations, CAD who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU from [**Hospital1 **] with MRSA pyelonephritis, likely aspiration pneumonia with acidosis and hypoxia, and NSTEMI thought to be due demand ischemia in setting of infection.
CXR showed RLL pneumonia (required Bipap at OSH, but discontinued on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]).
In the ICU, he was treated with vancomycin and zosyn (latter changed to cefepime) to cover both urinary and respiratory pathogens.
His outpatient urologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 91657**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] who recommended bilateral ureteral stent exchange.
His condition remained stable and he had PICC line placed for nafcillin treatment (commenced after completion of an 8-day course of linezolid/cefepime for aspiration PNA, per ID recs).
Concern was for complicated cystitis/pyelonephritis as patient has bladder cancer and ureteral stents.
Patient was empirically treated with zosyn and vancomycin at OSH.
Per ID, we started nafcillin (d1=[**6-24**]) for 14-day course for ongoing treatment of MSSA UTI.
Plan was for urology to perform ureteral stent exchange on [**6-23**], but procedure held [**2-23**] SBP's in 200s.
He was d/c'd on a total 14-day course of nafcillin to treat the MSSA.
# aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis: This was likely the cause of his dyspnea/hypoxia, and R-sided infiltrate was seen on CXR at OSH.
Patient initially required non-invasive ventilation for respiratory acidosis and required frequent suctioning for secretions.
It is unclear what precipitated the aspiration event; possibilities include narcotics as the patient was receiving IV morphine Q2H.
He completed a course for HCAP coverage with Cefepime (d1 = [**6-18**], treated for 8 day course), and linezolid (switched from vanc on [**6-22**] per VRE in urine and ID recs).
On metoprolol, lisinopril, simvastatin at home.
Following acute decompensation at OSH, patient with elevated troponin at OSH to 6.46.
Aspirin allergy not real (upset stomach) so okay to receive.
We continued ASA 81mg daily, simvastatin, beta blocker.
PICC line was placed for naficillin treatment (PICC can be d/c'd after final infusion of naficllin).
Prior to PICC placement, pt was eval'd by renal eval regarding possible HD access; renal requested b/l UE venous mapping and recommended PICC placement on dominant (pt's LEFT) arm.
Recent exposure to broad spectrum abx, significant WBC elevation not responding to appropriate treatment for pneumonia.
Flexiseal was placed due to high vol stool in non-ambulatory pt; loperamide given negative cdif, and diarrhea improved quickly thereafter.
# Hypertension: Had to increase metoprolol given NSTEMI, as well as Nifedipine and lisinopril 20mg daily.
Possibly in setting of normal saline administration.
Got 1 unit of PRBCs at [**Hospital1 18**] and Hct remained stable.
# DM: Patient with insulin dependent DM.
# HL: Continued simvastatin 40 mg daily  # Depression: Continued Sertraline 125 mg daily .
Patient to receive infusion services, to get Nafcillin 2g IV q6hrs x 13 days for a total 2week course.
Patient's PICC line can be d/c'd after final infusion is given.
