She was hydrated gently with D5 half normal saline at 50 cc an hour, and received antibiotics (vancomycin, Flagyl, ceftazidime) as well as PPI (Protonix) for stomach discomfort.
Her pain was controlled with a Fentanyl drip (175 micrograms per hour, which was titrated to 0) as well as a Fentanyl patch (100 micrograms q.
A Palliative Care consult was placed for the patient, Palliative Care was to help with social as well as supportive care in dealing with her pain as well as terminal illness.
She was able to review the options of continuing hemodialysis-needing a permanent catheter placed, as well as a possible need to remain inpatient for her hemodialysis.
After discussing this with the patient, it was arranged for the patient to have a permanent hemodialysis catheter placed.
The patient's condition at this point in time was discussed with the attending, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], as well as the Renal Fellow, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1860**], and the consensus was to continue the hemodialysis as her blood pressure tolerated.
On the day after this event, the events were discussed with the patient and she stated "I don't know if I can do this anymore".
Her physical examination had not changed at this point in time and her ascites/anasarca still remained from her costal margin to her toes.
The patient had initially hoped to be discharged to home, with transport to hemodialysis three times per week.
This was discussed with Palliative Care, and it was decided that the patient would be discharged to home, and at that point in time the family and the patient could decide on hemodialysis if it was still desired.
On [**2128-6-5**], the patient received her last dialysis treatments as an inpatient which she tolerated quite well.
Her blood pressure predialysis was 120/75, pulse rate 111, and her blood pressure postdialysis was 107/59, pulse 124; 2.7 kilograms were removed from the patient, and she tolerated this procedure well without any shortness of breath.
The patient was given prescriptions for all of her pain medications (Oxycodone elixir/Fentanyl patches) as well as her nausea and anxiety (Ativan).
