Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 66 year old male with multiple medical problems including diabetes, COPD on oxygen at baseline, hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented to the [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes clinic complaining of increased fatigue, shortness of breath and cough for the past three weeks.
Accordingly, pt began a one week course of azithromycin, started high dose IV steroids, combivent nebs, home-dose flovent/advair/spiriva, and was placed on BiPAP for improved ventilation/oxygenation.
As pt continued to improve, his steroids were transitioned from IV to po with subsequent taper, and mask ventilation was transitioned to nasal cannula w/o issue.
Pt was discharged on prednisone taper, azithromycin, home resp meds, with recommendation for close PCP/pulmonology f/u.
# Diabetes: [**Last Name (un) **] continued to follow during admission, adjusting insulin dosing as needed in the face of inflammation and steroid use.
Pt will continue to f/u with [**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient as he tapers off of the prednisone.
# Hypertension: BP was well-controlled on home meds (Toprol XL 50 mg, Norvasc 5 mg, Lisinopril 20 mg); lasix, diovan, and spironolactone were held during this admission due to thickened resp secretions suggesting the need for hydration.
# A-Fib - chronic coumadin for anticoagulation, toprol for rate control; INR 1.3 at discharge, so returned to home-dose coumadin schedule (initially altered due to INR 4.5 on admission).
