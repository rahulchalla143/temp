Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: S/P Frontal craniotomy for removal of brain mass.
He had erratic behaviors and drove to another state for unclear reason.
He received phenytoin and had a partial surgical resection on [**2198-3-2**] by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D., Ph.D.  Past Medical History: He previously was on medication for hypertension.
Other findings unchanged compared to the most recent CT as described above with subfalcine and uncal herniation.
Continued involutional changes from prior ACA infarct and left MCA infarct.
Medications (including propofol), metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
Postoperative change underlying left frontoparietal craniotomy with persistent pneumocephalus and blood and edema in the surgical bed, unchanged.
Right ventriculostomy catheter with unchanged caliber of the ventricular system with persistent ventricular blood as described.
HEAD MRI [**2198-3-3**] 1) Status post resection of a frontal lobe mass.
Blood products are seen at the surgical site.
Continued involutional changes from prior ACA infarct and left MCA infarct.
Status post resection of mass in the left frontotemporoparietal region with perilesional parenchymal hemorrhage and edema.
Stable position of right transfrontal ventriculostomy catheter with near complete interval resolution of intraventricular hemorrhage.
Status post resection of mass in the left frontotemporoparietal region with perilesional parenchymal hemorrhage and edema.
Stable position of right transfrontal ventriculostomy catheter with near complete interval resolution of intraventricular hemorrhage.
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST [**2198-3-3**] Status post resection of a frontal lobe mass.
Blood products are seen at the surgical site.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2198-3-2**] Status post left frontotemporal craniectomy with expected post-surgical change.
Differential consideration for this mass favor primary neoplasm of the brain.
However it has been suggested that immunoreactivity for synaptophysin alone is insufficient basis for recognizing a distinct neuronal component, that if looked for some synaptophysin immunoreactivity can occur in gliomas, and the biological significance remains a matter of debate.
Additional immunocytochemistry: Synaptophysin ??????
| AMPICILLIN------------  =>32 R LINEZOLID-------------     2 S PENICILLIN G----------  =>64 R VANCOMYCIN------------  =>32 R  Brief Hospital Course: NEUROSURGERY COURSE: Mr [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a emergent craniotomy for tumor removal and a placement of an External Ventricular Drain.
He remained intubated for approximately two days.
His EVD was weaned removed on [**2198-3-8**] and he was transferred to the step down.
He has been following commands including opening his eyes, moving his legs and sticking out his tongue.
The neurology team thought that he should remain on two antiepileptic agents (dilantin and keppra) - these were continued.
On [**2198-3-27**] the patient's family, after meeting extensively with social work decided that they would like to initiate the first round of therapy and also requested another meeting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26803**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] to pose additional questions about prognosis of this tumor and whether there are any experimental therapies or trials that [**Known firstname 53228**] could be enrolled in.
After discussion between Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] and the patient's parents, Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 724**] was made comfort measures only and aggressive care was withdrawn.
He continue to receive anti-epileptics Keppra and Dilantin to prevent seizures.
He was given morphine for comfort.
