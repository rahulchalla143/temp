A nasal splint was applied and eventually removed.
Acute Pain Service consulted for epidural catheter placement given her rib fractures.
She is receiving Tylenol prn; was receiving Fentanyl prn for pain in the Trauma ICU, but will be discharged on prn IV Morphine.
She should be changed to oral narcotics that can be given through her PEG once pain better controlled while at rehab.
