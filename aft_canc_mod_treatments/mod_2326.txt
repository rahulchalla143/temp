Admission Date:  [**2185-10-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2185-11-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2124-5-5**]       Sex:  F  Service:  FUNARD ICU  REASON FOR ADMISSION: Management of hypoxemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a sixty-one-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatitis C and positive CA-125 with cystic ovarian disease who was originally admitted to the Gynecologic service on [**2185-10-18**], for elective total abdominal hysterectomy bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for work up of ovarian cystic disease.
On postoperative day number two after an uncomplicated surgery, which revealed only benign cystic disease, the patient was noted to be acute hypoxic and an arterial blood gas at the time was 7.43/30/62 on four liters of nasal cannula oxygen.
No history of delirium tremens or hospitalizations for detoxification.
3) History of chronic low back pain on Fentanyl patch.
4) Status post cholecystectomy in [**2181**].
5) Status post left breast lumpectomy in [**2180**].
MEDICATIONS: Medications at the time of admission, Zyrtec, Ativan, Effexor XR, Trazodone, Combivent, AeroBid, Prilosec.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs, temperature 100.3 F, blood pressure 100/48, pulse 107, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation 90% on four liters nasal cannula oxygen.
1) Neurologic, the patient required heavy sedation with Benzodiazepines and Fentanyl throughout her hospitalization with an underlying concern for development of alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
She manifested no signs or symptoms suggestive of withdrawal syndrome and was maintained on Benzodiazepines throughout her hospitalization.
She was also given Folate and Thiamin daily.
2) Cardiovascular, the patient developed a high cardiac output, low SVR state on [**2185-10-21**] and after aggressive volume resuscitation required vasopressors and vasopressin to support her blood pressure.
vasopressin was ultimately discontinued on [**2185-10-31**].
The patient developed atrial fibrillation on [**2185-10-24**] and was loaded on Digoxin and maintained on a therapeutic dose thereof.
She was begun on basic strip after vasopressin was discontinued on [**2185-11-1**] with moderate success, secondary to borderline low venal arterial pressures.
On [**2185-10-31**], the patient was diagnosed with a ventilator associated pneumonia in the setting of developing a new retrocardiac opacification and increased purulent secretions.
After treating her initial aspiration pneumonia with Levaquin and Flagyl, for a ten day course from [**2185-10-19**] to [**2185-10-29**], she was restarted on [**2185-10-31**] with Vancomycin and Ceftazidine.
The patient received a tracheostomy after sixteen days of endotracheal intubation on [**2185-11-4**], with a #8 French forceps tube.
The procedure was complicated by inability to pass the original Shiley tracheotomy tube.
Surgery was consulted emergently at the bedside for placement of the tracheostomy.
The patient has been switched from assist control ventilation to pressure support ventilation, which she is tolerating well from the ventilatory pattern and gas exchange as the end point.
5) Infectious Disease, the patient's aspiration pneumonia was initially managed with Levaquin and Flagyl from [**2185-10-19**] to [**2185-10-29**].
Vancomycin was added empirically on [**2185-10-22**] for clinical decompensation.
All antibiotics were discontinued on [**2185-10-29**].
Vancomycin and Ceftazidine started on [**2185-10-31**] for suspicion of a ventilator associated pneumonia.
The patient's right IJ initially had an introducer with a Swan-Ganz catheter placed on [**2185-10-20**].
This was traded out over a wire for a triple lumen catheter on [**2185-10-23**].
6) Endocrine, the patient initially underwent a high dose ACCH stimulation test at the time of admission, which was negative.
The patient was subsequently started on Hydrocortisone and Fludrocortisone for a seven day course to be completed on [**2185-11-6**].
The patient has had elevated glucose throughout her hospitalization, which has been managed successfully with an insulin drip.
7) Nutrition, the patient was initially on hyperalimentation which has since been transitioned to tube feeds which were our goal at the time of this dictation.
DIAGNOSES: Diagnoses at the time of this dictation, 1) status post aspiration pneumonia.
6) Ventilator associated pneumonia.
MEDICATIONS: Medications at the time of this discharge summary dictation, 1) Ativan GGT 1 mg per hour.
2) Fentanyl GGT 50 mcg per hour.
3) Insulin GGT 3 units per hour.
4) Heparin GGT 1200 units per hour.
5) Lasix GGT 2 mg per hour.
6) Digoxin 0.125 mg intravenous every day.
7) Hydrocortisone 50 mg intravenous every six hours to be completed on [**2185-11-6**].
8) Fludrocortisone 0.1 mg by mouth every day to be completed on [**2185-11-6**].
9) Vancomycin 1 gm every twelve hours to be completed on [**2185-11-10**].
10) Ceftazidine 2 gm every eight hours to be completed on [**2185-11-10**].
