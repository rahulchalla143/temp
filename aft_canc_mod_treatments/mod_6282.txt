Patient received supportive care with transfusions of red cells and platelets as needed.
The patient was placed on oxygen and [**Last Name (STitle) **] cultures were drawn.
He was continued on voriconazole for history of disseminated fusarium and linezolid for history of VRE empyema.
Ertapenam was changed to Cefepime given history of E. coli bacteremia in order to broaden for possible Pseudomonas.
The infectious disease team was consulted, who recommended switching cefepime to meropenem.
On [**6-13**] antibiotics were changed to voriconazole, cefepime, metronidazole, linezolid and levaquin.
The patient was supported with albuterol nebulizers and ipratropium for obstructive lung disease along with [**Month/Year (2) **] suppressants.
Respiratory status declined acutely on [**2158-6-17**]; the patient desaturated to 84% and was placed on a non-rebreather briefly and then transitioned to a mask on 6 liters.
The patient and family wished to persue BiPap and the patient was transferred to the ICU for continued care.
While in the ICU, pt was briefly on BiPaP overnight but was soon able to be on shovel mask.
He was gently diuresed and his respiratory status remained stable on shovel mask O2.
While on the floor he received a prednisone taper (40mg x2days, 30x2days, 20x2days, 10x2days).
Pt was switched to xopenex from albuterol nebs due to tachycardia.
His IV antibiotics were taken off and he remained afebrile for several days prior to discharge.
Rate control has previously been difficult with hypotension on beta blockade.
