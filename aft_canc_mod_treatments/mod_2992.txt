After the administration of gadolinium contrast, the T1-weighted images were repeated in axial T1, sagittal MP-RAGE and multiplanar reconstructions.
Brief Hospital Course: 63-year-old male with DM-II, HTN, CAD, CKD, non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma s/p chemotherapy (no radiation therapy),  s/p kidney transplant (on Rapamune & Prednisone) who presented with worsening HTN urgency and 2 weeks of throbbing headaches and found to have extensive bihemispheric white matter lesions on MRI (R temporal and L parieto-occipital).
He was treated with methotrexate.
The patient also recieved leucovorin, bicarb and CVVHD to aid in renal protection.
He was given steroids and had repeat imaging which showed worsening of mets in increased brain edema.
The decision was made to start whole brain radiation as treatment.
After two treatments with whole brain radiation, and worsening of clinical condition, the family decided to make the patient comfort measures only.
He was started on a morphine drip and standing ativan.
Patient was treated initially with tylenol for pain, however required IV pain medications for severe headaches.
#Hypertension: Prior to admission, pts SBPs have been intermittently in the 170s over last month per OMR notes and his usual lisinopril and lasix have been discontinued for unclear reasons (likely related to his chemotherapies).
He was treated with PO labetalol and clonidine while in the ICU; pt also required labetalol gtt to achieve post-surgical BP goals of 130-160.
Pt was transitioned to home regimen of carvedilol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] and clonidine 0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **].
He is on sirolimus and prednisone for immunosuppression which were continued in the ICU.
He underwent CVVHD following methotrexate therapy to preserve remaining renal function.
CVVHD therapy was complicated by filter clotting but was continued to achieve a methotrexate level of <0.05.
Due to concern of worsening thrombocytopenia, sirolimus (switched to tacrolimus), bactrim and acyclovir were discontinued.
[**Month (only) 116**] also be a result of sirolimus treatment so switched to prograft on [**8-18**] for immunosuppression.
Also d/ced bactrim (switched to atovoquone) and acyclovir.
Empiric therapy with vancomycin was switched to ampcillin.
Usually on home Lantus with humalog sliding scale.
# Coronary artery disease: status-post 3V CABG in [**2173**].
#Phantom limb pain: continue tylenol as needed, recently stopped taking Vicodin.
