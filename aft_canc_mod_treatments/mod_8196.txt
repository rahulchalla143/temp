He was started on prednisone taper for his gout.
He continued on warfarin, and his INR remained stable at 1.5 and he remained on the heparin drip.
His anticoagulation will likely take several days given a recent course of vitamin K last week.
He was to continue on the heparin drip as written and warfarin for an anticoagulation goal INR of 2 to 3.
The patient remained stable with no other active issues over the weekend, and is awaiting placement at a rehabilitation facility as soon as a bed is available.
