She responded to 91-95% on a non-rebreather.
She received 10mg IV furosemide given that she likely had a positive fluid balance not well recorded since admission.
She presented initially with complaints of abdominal pain, dysphagia and generally not feeling well.
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 16549**] and on [**2164-4-30**] underwent an excisional biopsy of a right axillary lymph node which confirmed high grade small cell lung cancer.

She began cisplatinum and etoposide on the evening of admission.
The patient was started on chemotherapy with the goal of reducing tumor burden.
She received 3 days of cisplatinum and etoposide.
In addition, the patient was diuresed as much as possible though she required fluid boluses with chemotherapy administration and therefore was only negative 1.6L during her stay in the ICU.
The patient and her family clearly wished for the patient to be DNR/DNI with palliative therapy as possible.
Her oxygen was weaned down and her respiratory status improved.
A decision was made to initiate a second cycle of chemotherapy with 3 days of etoposide and cisplatinin which she tolerated without difficulty.
She is scheduled to unergo the third cycle of chemotherapy on Monday, [**6-18**].
TSH and cortisol were normal.
She was placed on fluid restriction.
She was given Filgrastim for two days after the first cycle of chemotherapy with improvement in her white cell counts.
Her white count was monitored closely after second cycle of chemotherapy and became neutropenic with lowest measured ANC of 144 at time of discharge.
She will need to have a recheck of her white count on Friday, [**6-15**] prior to starting her third cycle of chemotherapy on Monday, [**6-18**] to ensure that her counts have recovered.
# UTI: A screening urinalysis with culture showed enterococcus in the urine on [**5-26**] and vancomycin was given empirically.
Final culture results showed sensitvity to macrobid, ampicillin and vancomycin and patient was started on IV ampicillin.
Patient was switched to oral therapy with macrobid and will continue on this for a total of four doses to complete a 10-day course of antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection.
# Diarrhea: Developed diarrhea several days after cycle 2 of chemotherapy with multiple watery bowel movements daily (up to 10 bm's per day).
