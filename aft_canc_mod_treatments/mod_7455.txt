Patent aortobifemoral graft with a right groin collection most likely seroma, although an abscess cannot be excluded.
Alternatively multiphasic CT could also be performed (less desirable given multiple prior CT's) or this could be followed on subsequent imaging.
She was started on chemo/radiation therapy and transferred to [**Hospital1 **] to complete her treatment .
# Hypotension: On arrival to the hospital, patient was normotensive, in the emergency department, she was given valium and fentanly for sedation prior to MRI and became hypotensive to 60/40, she was bolused 4 L NS in the ED and admitted to the MICU.
Hypotension is of unclear etiology  likely hypovolemia versus medication side effect (occured following valium and fentanyl).
She was discharged OFF her home Metoprolol, which was not restarted.
No further imaging was done as the patient was claustrophobic and does not tolerate sedating medications well.
Her Foley was discontinued when she arrived to the floor and was urinating without issues.
Her case was discussed during GI rounds and it was decided to start neo-adjuvant chemo/radiation therapy.
5FU and radiation therapy was started [**2177-5-7**], the plan is for her to continue radiation for 30 treatments and 5-Fluorouracil for 6 weeks however duration of therapy will be guided by outpatient oncologist.
Port appears to be placed for chemo but patient was unclear of plan.
[**Hospital3 **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] for medical records and Onc and Rad Onc were consulted.
Pain control with tylenol, prn oxycodone.
Please see course and plan for treatment as above.
# UTI: on [**5-8**] patient had dysuria and grossly positive UA, she was treated with ciprofloxacin and will need to continue for a total of 7 days.
# Diabetes: Insulin sliding scale.
Aspirin was continued once it was decided there would be no further procedures.
Was on standing tylenol, gabapentin, lidocaine patch, oxycodone prn.
