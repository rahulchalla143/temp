Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 42 yo woman with PMH significant for morbid obesity with gastric bypass who presented from OSH ED with acute monocytic leukemia, she was treated with 7+3 and her course was complicated by pericardial tamponade and febrile neutropenia.
# Acute Leukemia: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was diagnosed with acute monocytic leukemia and initiated 7+3 induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin and cytarabine which she tolerated well.
The patient's hypoxia resolved with simultaneous treatment with antibiotics (see below) and chemotherapy.
A pericardial drain was placed and removed the next day as little drainage was noted overnight.
She was initially treated with Vancomycin and developed a rash she was then pre-medicated for subsequent doses which were tolerated without issue.
She was treated with Vancomycin and cefepime and continued to have low grade fevers.
Micafungin was added and low grade fevers continued.
Antibiotics were again broadened to include vancomycin, cefepime, voriconazole, and metronidazole.
Potential sources included central line (removed and tip culture negative) pulmonary, pericaridal fluid or malignancy.
ID was consulted who recommended sending pericardial fluid for fungal, bacterial and viral (EBV, Coxackie, Enterovirus, adenovirus) culture and Acid fast (TB) culture & smear; Cytologic exam; Cell Count and Differential; Enterovirus RNA, Qualitative, RT-PCR; EBV PCR, Coxackie PCR, Adenovirus PCR, all of which were negative.
Antibiotics were changed again to Voriconazole, meropenem, and vancomycin nad metronidazole.
Antibiotics were held and fevers resolved.
# Menses: Patient was treated with Provera during her chemotherapy to prevent menses.
# Hyperlipidemia: Held statin during admission.

You were found to have acute myelogenous leukemia and were treated with chemotherapy you had a repeat bone marrow biopsy prior to being discharged and the results are pending.
While your white blood cell count was low, you developed fevers and were treated with antibiotics, no source of fever was identified and the antibiotics were stopped.
Your medication list has changed substantially since your admission.
Please see the attached list for the medications that you should be taking.
