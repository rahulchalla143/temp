HOSPITAL COURSE:  As stated, the patient was admitted directly to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting.
In summary, he had a LIMA to the LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the OM.
His bypass time was 52 minutes with a cross-clamp time of 38 minutes.
He tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the operating room to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit.
He had epinephrine at 0.012 mcg per kilogram per minute, Neo- Synephrine at 0.5 mcg per kilogram per minute, and propofol at 30 mcg per kilogram per minute.
He was weaned from his epinephrine drip.
Initial attempts to awaken the patient and wean from the ventilator were discontinued as the patient became increasingly agitated as the sedation was weaned to off.
He, therefore, was resedated and remained intubated throughout the night on the day of surgery.
On postoperative day 2, it was again attempted to wean the patient from sedation and the ventilator.
Additionally, patient had episodes of postoperative atrial fibrillation for which he was started on amiodarone.
His chest tubes were removed.
The sedation was changed to Precedex following which the patient was able to be successfully weaned from the ventilator and extubated.
Therefore, a Dobbhoff feeding tube was placed and tube feeds were initiated.
He received vigorous chest physiotherapy.
His tube feeds were advanced to goal and on postoperative day 9, he was transferred to the floor for continuing postoperative course and cardiac rehabilitation.
It should be noted that during the patient's stay in the intensive care unit, his creatinine which has a baseline of 2.3, had risen to [**Location (un) **] of 3.3 at which point the nephrology service was consulted.
