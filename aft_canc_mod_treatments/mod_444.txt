Pt initially evaluated following IR line placements.
With review of systems negative for fevers, chills, dizziness, headaches, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, dysuria, but mild LE swelling but less than prior per pt.
Past Medical History: Oncologic History: The patient was first diagnosed with MM 4 years ago, at which point he underwent VDD chemotherapy and an autologous SCT in [**2148-7-14**].
The patient responded well to this transplant until [**2150-6-13**].
At this point, he was noticed to have an increase in his IgG level and was started on Thalidimide and Decadron.
The patient continued on this regimen until [**2151-9-13**], at which point he was started on Revlimid daily due to disease progression.
The  patient was then started on Valcade in [**2152-3-14**] and Cytoxan in [**2152-5-14**].
The patient's IgG continued to increase, and he was thus switched back to high-dose Revlimid and Decadron in [**2152-8-14**].
The patient was thus electively admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for PACE chemotherapy prior to SCT.
<br>  TREATMENT HISTORY per OMR records including present:  4 Cycles of DVD(Doxil, Vincristine, Decadron which he completed in [**5-17**].
[**2148-6-26**]- High-dose Cytoxan for stem cell mobilization.
[**6-18**]- Due to relapsed disease initiated Thalidomide with periodic Decadron pulses.
[**4-20**]- Revlimid was added with second cycle of Velcade and Decadron  [**5-21**]- Revlimid held with 3rd cycle but Cytoxan was added to Velcade and Decadron therapy.
[**5-21**]- Revlimid was added with 4th and 5th cycle of chemotherapy with Velcade/Decadron/Cytoxan  [**7-21**]- Day 12 Velcade was held with 5th cycle d/t worsening neuropathy.
[**Date range (1) 13041**] - Pt received Revlmid and Decadron.
[**11-20**]-Pt received 1 cycle of Doxil/Revlimid/Decadron  [**12-22**]- Completed 2 cycles of DT-PACE (Decadron, Thalidomide, Adriamycin, etoposide, Cytoxan, and cisplatin)-Of note, Thalidomide was ultimately held part way through the 2nd cycle d/t bradycardia.
Also, the continous infusion of adriamycin was also held for a little over a day of the second cycle.
[**2153-1-31**]- Admit for allogeneic stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor with Antigen A mismatch to receive Bulsulfan (dose adjusted for goal of 900) and Cytoxan for conditioning.

Dependent high density within the gallbladder, probably due to gallbladder sludge as reported on prior abdominal ultrasound.
Some clips are noted around the distal esophagus suggesting prior surgery here.
The small bowel is also decompressed but again appears relatively featureless, but subtle disease within the bowel would be difficult to ascertain given the absence of oral and intravenous contrast.

After a conversation with his family, it was decided to make the patient DNR/DNI, and non-invasive ventilation was used.
His hospital course to date is below:  # Multiple Myeloma:  He underwent allogenic stem cell transplant with Bulsulfan (dose adjusted for goal of 900) and Cytoxan for conditioning.
Immunosuppression was mantained with cyclosporine until [**3-2**] when it was stopped due to concern that it's vasoconstricting effects led to acute tubular necrosis.
Steroids were started in its place once the cyclosporine level downtrended out of the theraputic range.
After approximately 2 weeks of steroids and discussion with renal, steroids were stopped and cyclosporine was reinitiated.
Steroids were then added back 8 weeks after transplant in addition to cyclosporine due to concern for the development of acute graft versus host disease manifested by increasing bilirubin, diarrhea and a very mild rash.
His course of defibrotide was complicated by bloody bowel movements.
Anticoagulation was avoided given the patients' severe thrombocytopenia.
# Thrombocytopenia, GI bleeding, CMV viremia: The patient's platelet levels remained slow to improve, even after WBC engraftment.
Given concern for medication-induced BM suppression/thrombocytopenia, vancomycin was changed to daptomycin and protonix was changed to ranitidine.
Bleeding ceased with platelet transfusions and aminocaproic oral rinse.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for EGD and aggressive blood product support with goal platelet count >50K.
While in the ICU, the patient continued to bleed with hypotension requiring pressor support and intubation.
EGD was done on multiple occasions and revealed large clots resting on a highly friable mucosa.
His CMV viral load returned positive and he was started on ganciclovir.
Goal platelet count >50K was maintained once the patient returned from the ICU with continued need for frequent replacement of unclear reason.
Repeat CMV VL were negative twice (separated by 5 days), however, patient was continued on treatment level dosing given LP suggestive of viral meningitis.
The differential for his ATN included cylosporine vs micafungin (started for febrile neutropenia) vs vancomycin (started for febrile neutropenia).
Vancomycin was switched to dosing via HD protocol.
Micafungin was switched to anulidafungin.
The patient remained on HD three times weekly for several weeks until the third week in [**Month (only) 547**] during which he demonstrated an overwhelming post-ATN diuresis with rapid decrease in his creatinine towards normal.
The BUN elevation was felt to be secondary to TPN and steroids, and was not felt to be indicative of renal dysfunction.
Adenosine was used to break the rhythm during initial presentation early in [**Month (only) 958**].
PO metoprolol regimen used thereafter with occasional seconds-long episodes of rates to the 130s with almost immediate spontaneous resolution.
Rate was well-controlled on diltiazem drip, and thus decision was made to switch from metoprolol to standing oral diltiazem.
With this treatment, his rate was well-controlled, although he continued to have runs of irregular narrow complex tachycardia, most frequently in the setting of bladder spasm/pain which eventually resolved with oxybutynin and patient remained rate controlled on oral diltiazem.
# Febrile neutropenia, Fevers post-engraftment, Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: Prior to engraftment, the patient was covered broadly with antibiotics and antifungals for febrile neutropenia of unknown source.
No source was identified but coverage remained broad and all lines were removed and later replaced.
He was noted to have a HAP/VAP at that time and coverage was re-expanded in plans for a 10-day treatment course with vanc and meropenem.
Once back on the floors, he was noted to have diffuse ground glass infiltrate and underwent bronchoscopy with broncheoalveolar lavage.
He was treated was IV boluses of 80 mg Lasix and his antibiotics continued with vancomycin, meropenem, and voriconazole (the vori was switched to micafungin when it was felt vori might be contributing to his hyperkalemia).
He was transferred back to the floors with adequate oxygenation on nasal cannula.
Meropenem was discontinued with goal of stopping antibiotics but patient spike a fever again and it was restarted.
Given his delirium, dilaudid and acyclovir were held with improvement in his mental status.
While in the ICU (for respiratory distress), he was treated with ipratropium (anti-cholinergic) nebs and noted to have anisocoria.
A repeat MRI after transfer back to the floor again was difficult to read given motion artifact but showed no diffusion abnormality or abnormal enhancement.
While he was able to continue to work with physical and occupational therapy, his recovery will require extensive future therapy in a highly skilled environment.
They recommended oxybutynin for bladder spasm and bladder ultrasound.
His pain improved with anticholinergic tx, and eventually the foley was removed.
