The patient still complained of mild stomach pains in the upper abdomen prior to this antibiotic treatment and then stated that after Ceclor, he began having diffuse abdominal pain with tenderness and nausea but not vomiting.
At the outside hospital, he was noted to be tachycardiac with shortness of breath, unable to take a deep breath secondary to pain, as well as being febrile.
MEDICATIONS:  Atenolol 10 mg once a day, Naproxen p.r.n., Ceclor as mentioned above.
LABORATORY DATA:  On presentation to [**Hospital6 649**] his white blood cell count was 12.8, 53% neutrophils, 27% bands, 10% lymphocytes, hematocrit 38.3, platelet count 610; PT 15.2, PTT 26.2, INR 1.5; sodium 133, potassium 4.9, chloride 99, bicarb 24, BUN 19, creatinine 1.8, glucose 132; ALT 61, AST 79, alkaline phosphatase 139, total bilirubin 0.9, amylase 22, albumin 2.3; urinalysis on [**9-25**] showed a large amount of blood with trace amounts of protein, ketones and leukocytes.
The patient was admitted to Surgery, made NPO with intravenous fluids, given intravenous antibiotics, and blood cultures were sent.
In placed on CIWA prophylaxis for his alcoholism.
Subsequently this liver biopsy revealed a significant amount of fibrosis and inflammation but no tumor etiology.
After being appropriately consented, the patient was taken to the Operating Room for exploratory laparotomy where lysis of adhesions were also performed.
The patient was noted during this surgery to have 4 L of pus within his abdominal cavity, as well as three large hepatic abscesses.
The patient was left packed, and drains were placed to allow drainage of the abscess cavities.
The patient's course in the Intensive Care Unit over the next two days was uneventful except for several fluid boluses, as well as several transfusions of packed red blood cells.
During the rest of the Intensive Care Unit stay, the patient was again monitored with a Swan-Ganz catheter for volume status and hemodynamics.
He had fluid repletion for his hypervolemia and also had electrolyte repletion multiple times for hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.
Since the patient's hematocrit at this time was stable, this hematoma was managed conservatively and subsequently continued to drained out blood but soon dried up, and the drain was removed shortly after on [**10-6**].
His central line and Foley were both discontinued.
The patient was continued on pulmonary treatment with nebulizers to assist his saturations, as well as BIPAP machine at night to help his oxygen saturations.
Stool was sent for C-diff while the patient was on the floor but was negative.
A disposition screen was performed by Physical Therapy who stated that the patient would do well from a short stay in a rehabilitation facility.
He still has a drain that is putting out serosanguinous fluid with a slight greenish tinge that may be bilious, and we will therefore keep this drain in.
Status post ultrasound-guided liver biopsy.
Status post exploratory laparotomy times two.
Status post lysis of adhesions.
Status post suction bulb placement times four.
Chronic blood loss anemia requiring multiple red blood cells transfusions.
Hypovolemia requiring fluid resuscitation.
Hypokalemia requiring Potassium repletion.
Hypomagnesemia requiring Magnesium repletion.
Exchange of central line over the wire.
