# Stage IV lung CA: On presentation, Mr. [**Known lastname 28145**] had an apical mass expanding, adrenal mass on CTA suspicious for metastasis and radicular symptoms in right arm likely [**1-3**] nerve compression but per Pain Clinic.
Radiation Oncology evaluated him and determined that re-radiation was unlikely to improve his symptoms because of poor tumor response in the past.
Pain control was maintined and he with his mother decided that inpatient hospice with a change of code status to DNR/DNI would be best for Mr. [**Known lastname 28145**].
He recieved 7 days of imperic antibotics with azithromycin, ceftriaxone and flagyl which seemed to have resolved the pneumonia, but he continued to [**Known lastname 28148**] difficulty oxygenating.
He was aided by albuterol nebs Q2 hours and ipratropium nebs Q6H PRN.
In the setting of his lobectomy and recurrent lung cancer, his new hypoxia was believed to represent a new baseline oxygen need.
