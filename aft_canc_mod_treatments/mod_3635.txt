Mr. [**Known lastname **] was recently started on antibiotics for a bronchitis infection.
He was treated with 1gm of dilantin and 1mg of ativan.
He was sent for an MRI in the ED but was unable to tolerate the study due to too many secretions in his trach.
He was not treated with any antibiotics.
Medullary Astrocytoma: s/p stereotactic endoscopic ventriculostomy on [**2186-1-25**] and surgical debulking of the fourth ventricular exophytic pilocytic astrocytoma on [**2186-11-24**].
Status post suboccipital craniectomy with extensive post-surgical changes and suggestion of possible residual tumor at the caudal aspect of the fourth ventricle without significant interval change.
MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM [**2187-1-17**] Comparison is made with [**2186-11-25**].
Interval enlargement of non-enhancing lesion in the right frontal lobe of uncertain etiology.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50 year-old RH man with a PMH of a pilocytic astrocytoma s/p partial surgical resection who presented with a seizure from an OSH.
He was initially covered with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and acyclovir.
Given that he remained afebrile, normal EEG and clearing of mental status with no growth on CSF culture, his ABX were discontinued on HD #3.
The following other issues were addressed during his stay:  # Medullary Astrocytoma: s/p stereotactic endoscopic ventriculostomy on [**2186-1-25**] and surgical debulking of the fourth ventricular exophytic pilocytic astrocytoma on [**2186-11-24**].
He was continued on Keppra [**Hospital1 **].
Due to increased ventricular size, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from Neurosurgery was called to place a VP shunt on [**2187-1-26**] which went well.
He was given 3 days of gentamicin and vancomycin for prophylactic therapy.
MR head on [**1-17**] showed ventricular dilatation and a VP shunt was placed on [**1-26**].
He was continued on Zyprexa qhs, given 10 days of thiamine 100mg IV daily per his Neurononcologist Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 724**].
Lines / tubes / meds were minimized as able.
# Secretions/bulbar dysfunction:  For this patient was treated with chest PT, suction q2H and PRN.
He was also given a scopalamine patch but developed delirium related to this.
The team and family considered replaceing his tracheostomy but it was felt this will not prevent aspiration.
A video swallow study on [**2187-1-24**] showed aspiration of nearly everything and patient was kept NPO with tube feeds via PEG.
# Acute renal failure: Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed ARF with Cr bumping up to 2.6 likely due to acyclovir +/- vancomycin given FENa 5%.
Cr improved to 1.8-2.0 with hydration and remained stable at that level.
Given that he had peritonitis, replacement of the PEG was deferred for 1 week and in the meantime, he was given nutrition through NGT which needed to be replaced x3 times given that he pulled it out during confusion.
Following PEG placement pt complained of abdominal pain and CT was done which was not indicative of acute issues but patient did have bilateral free air likely due to insufflation during PEG replacement.
Patient has been receiving tube feeds since that time, gradually increasing to a goal of 65cc/hr, currently at 35cc/hr.
# Tracheostomy:  On HD#7, he also removed his own trach but because he had good cough reflex without respiratory distress, his trach was not replaced.
# Aspiration PNA: He completed 8 days of Vancomycin and cefepime for hospital acquired aspiration pneumonia.
He was started on diltiazem QID with good rate control.
Patient subsequently converted to sinus rhythm.
It was decided to hold anticoagulation at this time due to risk of intracranial hemorrage.
# Positive UA: Patient had foley catheter placed for incontinence on [**2187-1-20**] and d/c'd on [**2187-1-23**].
A Pre-operative U/A showed 11 WBC and patient spiked fever to 100.7 and so treated with Bactrim for 7 days, ending the day of discharge.
PEG replaced and tube feeds continued.
