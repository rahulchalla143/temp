Of note, at baseline the patient has chronic diarrhea, stool has been sent for O&P and culture, which have been negative.
Attempts to place an IV were unsuccessful, and the patient's family requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
She was given a dose of vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl for concern of an intra-abdominal infection.
A left IJ was placed for access.
On presentation pt appeared to be septic with possible sources including GI (Cdiff), skin ulcers, pneumonia (effusion may have been parapneumonic).
Due to persistent hypotension, hypoperfusion (altered mental status, anuria and ATN, elevated lactate), pt required fluid resuscitation and pressor support.
She was treated empirically with vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl to empirically cover for  hospital acquired PNA and C. diff.
Given difficulty finding infectious source, pt had CT scan - which showed incidental finding consistent with endometrial cancer, local metastases to bone and possible uterine infection.
Pt was then extubated, started on Morphine drip and quickly passed away.
