Occasional ovalocytes, dacrocytes and polychromatophilic cells seen, 2 nucleated RBCs, 100 nucleated cells seen.
There is a predominance of large, immature forms with high nuclear cytoplasm ratio, scant agranular cytoplasm, prominent nucleoli and fine chromatin consistent with blast forms.
Erythroid precursors show normoblastic maturation with occasional megaloblastoid forms, irregular nuclear contours, and rare nuclear buds.
Erythroid precursors are decreased and exhibit normoblastic maturation.
A normal EGR1 FISH finding can result from absence of a 5q deletion, from a 5q deletion that does not involve the region to which this probe hybridizes, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
FISH evaluation for a 7q deletion was performed with the Vysis D7S522/CEP7 Dual Color Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for D7S522 at 7q31 and CEP7 (D7Z1) (chromosome 7 alpha satellite DNA) at 7p11.1-q11.1 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
A normal D7S522 FISH finding can result from the absence of a 7q deletion, from a 7q deletion that does not involve the region to which this probe hybridizes, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
FISH evaluation for a 20q deletion was performed with the Vysis LSI D20S108 Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) at 20q12 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
Two hybridization signals were observed in 98/100 nuclei examined, which is within the normal range established for this probe in the Cytogenetics Laboratory at [**Hospital1 18**].
A normal 20q FISH finding can result from absence of a 20q deletion, from a 20q deletion that does not involve the region to which this probe hybridizes, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
Erythrocytes are decreased and exhibit moderate anisocytosis and poikilocytosis.
Scattered microcytes, echinocytes, elliptocytes, dacrocytes and red cell fragments are seen.
- Bone marrow [**2158-8-16**]: <<<<      >>>  .
Right subclavian PICC line extends to the mid portion of the SVC.
Right PICC tip is in the mid SVC.
Stable right-sided pulmonary nodules as detailed above; can be followed in six months as suggested on initial [**2158-7-24**] CT chest.
E-cadherin expression is present in scattered clusters of early erythroid precursors, while Glycophorin A highlights numerous maturing erythroid forms.
A triple lumen subclavian CVL was placed on [**7-14**].
He was started on 7+3 induction therapy on [**7-14**].
He tolerated the infusion well and his ANC fell to 0 on [**7-22**].
Repeat bone marrow showed hypercellularity.
Patient was started on MEC therapy and tolerated it well.
Repeat bone marrow on D14 of MEC showed hypocellularity.
His counts gradually increased and antibiotics were discontinued, he had been on broad coverage with vancomycin, cefepime, and ambisome (spent a lot of time in [**State 15946**]) and remained on these antibiotics until he was no longer neutropenic or febrile.
Considering his bone marrow response and the resolution of this rash, it was thought to be rseolved.
# Febrile Neutropenia: As counts decreased, the patient was febrile without obvious source in urine or lungs and was started on cefepime and vancomycin and levofloxacin which had been prescribed for cough was discontinued.
Given the concern for hemorrhoids and possible minor anal mucosal tear, see below, Flagyl was added.
Micafungin was added on day 4 after first spike given continued fevers.
Patient clinically improved, but then developed high fevers, rigors, and whole-body rash, respiratory distress (see ICU course below).
ID was consulted and suggested removing cefepime and micafungin as they might cause rash.
He was placed on vancomycin, meropenem, and ambisome (for aspergillus and coccidiomycosis coverage).
He improved clinically and antibiotic coverage was stopped on [**8-26**] when patient had been afebrile for several days and ANC >1000.
ID was consulted again and advised to recheck beta glucan, as it may have been an erroneous result, since he was asymptomatic and had stable lesions on chest CT from [**8-26**], and also requested a mycoF/lytic culture.
Bowel regimen increased and further BMs were guaiac neg and soft for the rest of his hospital course.
Hematuria resolved as thrombocytopenia resolved, platelets were transfused for <10.
#Acute kidney injury: Patient's creatinine was elevated starting [**8-24**] from baseilne of 0.9 to 1.8 on [**8-29**] despite removal of nephrotoxic vancomycin and ambisome on [**8-26**].
MRI T and C spine and brachail plexus were ordered to eval for CNS spread of disease, in addition LP was done.
Pt was initially given nebs, changed from NC to facemask, and given IV lasix.
He was redosed with lasix with good urine output.
Broad spectrum antibiotics were continued but elevated LFTs raised concern over the administration of fluconazole.
Because of the pts significant travel history to some fungal endemic regions it was determined to treat emperically with Ambisome so this was started and Fluconazole D/Ced.
This calmed down with demerol and tylenol and was thought likely due to the infusion vs an infectious cause.
Over brief ICU course 1 unit of PRBC was initially given followed by 2 units PRBC the next day.

You were started on chemotherapy.
We did CT scans of your sinus, chest, and abdomen to look for a source of infeciton.
We continued with medications to treat bacterial or fungal infections.
Your sutures can be taken out in one week (around [**9-7**]), this can be done at clinic.
We made the following changes to your medications: stop taking diovan start taking nifedipine (procardia) start taking acyclovir  Followup Instructions: Provider: [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1220**].
