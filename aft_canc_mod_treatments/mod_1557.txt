Admission Date:  [**2144-5-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-5-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-1-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**] Chief Complaint: Nausea, vomiting, hematemasis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD, arteriovenous graft revision, placement of tunnelled dialysis catheter, central line placement   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 32034**] is a 74 year old man with DM II c/b triopathy, CRI on dialysis (baseline Cr 4), aortic stenosis, dilated CMP (EF 60%), and recent GI bleed who presents with nausea, coffee ground emesis, poor po intake, increasing confusion, and foul-smelling urine.
[**Name (NI) **] his son, both EGD and colonoscopy showed a source of bleeding, but the patient did not require any transfusions.
He was discharged, and was initially incontinent of stool and still confused but then began to be more active with improved appetite after a week.
He still required his son to administer medications, a task the patient had been able to do before.
He was described as endorsing chest discomfort but not true chest pain.
1st set of cardiac enzymes showed Troponin 0.10, which was decreased compared to prior Troponin levels and consistent with decreased clearance [**12-28**] to his poor renal function.
He received 4mg Zofran IV and 40 mg pantoprazole.
U/A was obtained given his foul-smelling urine, which was positive for UTI.
He received ciprofloxacin IV 400mg.
He is admitted for r/o MI, hydration given inability to tolerate POs, w/u of GI bleed, and UTI.
The patient was unsure of prior chest pain, SOB, hematemesis, foul-smelling urine, or dysuria.
CXR [**5-3**] CHEST, THREE VIEWS: There has been interval placement of an OG tube with tip and side hole projecting below the diaphragm.
KUB [**5-5**] ABDOMEN, TWO VIEWS: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with stool and gas seen in the large bowel.
Possible precipitation of retained barium in the stomach, with refluxed contrast material in the esophagus.
[**5-14**] CXR Right internal jugular vascular catheter is unchanged in position, but new right internal jugular dialysis catheter has been placed, with tip terminating in expected location of proximal right atrium.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 year old man with DM II c/b triopathy, CRI on dialysis (baseline Cr 4), aortic stenosis, dilated CMP (EF 60%), and recent GI bleed who presents with nausea, coffee ground emesis, poor po intake, increasing confusion, UTI, and ?chest discomfort.
Briefly, pt was being treated for upper GI bleed and suspected severe gastroparesis when he missed an oral dose of amiodarone and went into rapid ventricular rate atrial fibrillation.
He was then transferred to the CCU, where he was placed on an amiodarone drip until rate controlled.
Pt was started on erythromycin with some improvement in vomiting, but this was d/c'd as pt's QT became more prolonged.
GI recommended restarting reglan and continued to follow pt.
TPN was also started on HD#13.
He had an endoscopy and colonoscopy at that hospital which showed prepyloric antritis consistent with gastroparesis, esphagitis with mucosal ulceration, moderate-severe ischemic colitis, sigmoid diverticulitis, and internal hemorrhoids.
Pt with significant emesis, missed one dose of PO amiodarone and was found to be in asymptomatic rapid a fib on HD#6.
He was transferred to the CCU, where he was quickly stabilized on amio drip then transitioned back to PO.
A few hours later, he returned to this irregular rhythm, which was then unresponsive to 10mg metoprolol and 30mg diltiazem, with resultant hypotension.
He was evaluated by transplant surgery and taken to the OR on HD#11 for revision of the fistula, which subsequently re-thrombosed in dialysis that day.
A tunnelled catheter was then placed for continued dialysis.
His medications were renally dosed while in house.
He was started on a heparin gtt on HD#13, as the risk of hypercoaguability was determined to outweigh the risk of further GI bleed.
Received ASA in ED.
# DM II: Pt was on lantus and ISS at home.
His lantus dose was decreased given poor PO intake.
With the addition of intravenous nutrition, his blood glucose increased and dosages of insulin were appropriately adjusted.
Pt was started on ceftriaxone, but urine cx negative so abx d/c'd.
ASA 81 mg held due to concern for GI bleed.
Amiodarone, metoprolol, and atorvastatin were continued.
*) Hypothyroidism: Pt had elevated TSH, thought to be secondary to decreased absorption of levothyroxine in setting of prolonged gastric emptying.
Levothyroxine dose was increased and changed to IV in setting of poor tolerance of POs.
*) FEN: Pt NPO for first few days of admission.
Nutrition recommended tube feeds, but pt declined.
After dialysis was reiintiated, TPN was started.
