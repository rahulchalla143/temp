Patient was C. difficile positive by PCR at OSH and had been started on IV flagyl prior to transfer as she was unable to take oral vancomycin.
An nasogastric tube was placed at OSH, and she continued to have non-bloody, bilious output from NG tube with no signs of acute abdomen on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
Colorectal surgery and GI were consulted as was [**Hospital1 **].
Given metastases, palliative surgical resection was considered, but the decision was made to treat the C. difficile infection and see if surgery could be avoided and colonic stent could placed given it being a lower risk procedure.
The patient was continued on treatment with IV Flagyl with improvement in abdominal pain and was able to take clear liquids and move her bowels.
Based on this improvement, the decision was made to defer palliative surgical resection and a colonic stent was placed on [**2149-12-12**] with good effect.
Following the procedure the patient was able to tolerate a soft low residue diet.
Once able to tolerate orals, the patient was started on oral vancomycin to complete a total of a 2 week course from the date of the colonic stent placement, last day of therapy [**2149-12-26**].
Pt tolerated oral diet for 3-4 days prior to DC.
Pt was converted to her home regimen of morphine SR 15mg [**Hospital1 **] with prn percocet which controlled her symptoms well prior to DC.
In addition, pt was started on PPI therapy during admission.
#FEN: Patient was started on TPN due to obstruction.
Following stent placement, patient was able to take increased oral diet.
Pt stated that she did not want to receive TPN at home.
#Colorectal adenocarcinoma with liver and lung metastases/anemia/thrombocytopenia: Chemotherapy was held during hospitalization.
Pain control as above.
Patient remained in sinus rhythm since admission.
