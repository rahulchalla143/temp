Brief Hospital Course: This is an 89 year old woman with CAD (BMS vs. DES in [**2105**] S/P dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and plavix for one year), CLL on observation without prior treatments, and cholecystectomy who presented with choledocholithiasis (2 stones in the CBD) and underwent an ERCP with stone removal and sphincterotomy complicated by subsequent bleed requiring transfusion and cauterization via repeat ERCP and [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] hemodynamic monitoring.
The bleeding was likely secondary to sphincterotomy procedure given active bleeding seen on repeat endoscopy and the need for hemostasis with cautery.
She was treated with empiric IV PPI, empiric Unasyn, and bowel rest.
Her ASA was held in setting of GI bleed.
We restarted her diet and BP  medications after few days.
After transfusion and transfer to the floor, she had continuous melena and small decrease in her HgB and Hct from peak of 10.5 to 9.5 and 31.7 to 27.4 respectively that was concerning for continued bleeding, however, no overt continued bleeding was seen after several days and her hematocrit began to improve.
Antibiotics were stopped as there was no clinical cholangitis.
Her aspirin was restarted as her bleeding had abated, and she has a history of CAD and coronary stents.
