The patient had bilateral partial nephrectomies at that time for chromophobe oocytic component tumor (grade II to III) with 4.5 cm skin size with capillary penetration but negative margins.
The patient denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, and palpitations.
In the Emergency Department, the patient responded to 3 liters of oxygen with oxygen saturations coming up to 92% but had an increasing oxygen requirement.
The patient was seen by the Primary Medicine team at 4 a.m. and was short of breath on 100% nonrebreather but was mentating well.
The patient has been on dialysis since [**2135**].
Celexa 20 mg p.o.
Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o.
Metoprolol 75 mg p.o.
Isosorbide mononitrate 90 mg p.o.
Zantac 150 mg p.o.
Zestril 20 mg p.o.
Clarinex 5 mg p.o.
Ticlid 250 mg p.o.
Renagel 21 mg p.o.
Phos-Lo 3 p.o.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on admission revealed temperature was 96.3, heart rate was 76, blood pressure was 190/80, the respiratory rate was 21, and the oxygen saturation was 80% to 92% on a 100% nonrebreather mask.
HYPOXIA ISSUES:  The patient was admitted with hypoxia with an oxygen requirement, but his saturations improved on 100% nonrebreather mask to the 90s.
Of note, the patient came to the Intensive Care Unit on a nitroglycerin drip and had been taking isosorbide mononitrate, and this may have worsened his respiratory status as it may have dilated pulmonary vasculature that was contracting to try and keep his V/Q match.
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient continued to improve his oxygenation and was switched to 6 liters nasal cannula and was breathing comfortably.
This likely was an iatrogenic elevated bicarbonate level due to either over bicarbonated dialysis solution and/or his Phos-Lo and/or Renagel.
Those two medications were held in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, and he was dialyzed again with a low bicarbonate solution, and his bicarbonate resolved down to 27 after that.
The patient was initially placed on a labetalol drip with good affect.
This was after the nitroglycerin drip was stopped.
The next day we attempted to take the patient off the labetalol drip and maintain him on his metoprolol 75 mg p.o.
twice per day; however, this was not sufficient overnight, and the patient was placed on hydralazine 20 mg intravenously every six hours for blood pressure maintenance which worked well.
The patient was also switched from Ticlid to Plavix for an anti-platelet [**Doctor Last Name 360**] which the patient is presumably on in lieu of aspirin which he is allergic to.
TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on an insulin sliding-scale and a diabetic diet with fingersticks four times per day.
PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on subcutaneous heparin and ranitidine for gastrointestinal prophylaxis.
