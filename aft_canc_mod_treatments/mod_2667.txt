An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedure was performed, and a stent was placed initially.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, and an open cholecystectomy was performed in addition to a pylorus preserving Whipple procedure.
The procedure was done under general anesthesia, and the patient did not require any blood products.
The patient's condition was stable at the conclusion of the operation, and he was brought to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit.
The plan at this point was to keep the patient intubated until the next morning, and replete electrolytes as needed, and to continue expectant management.
The [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Service was consulted, and the sliding-scale insulin was adjusted accordingly.
On postoperative day three, the patient's nasogastric tube was removed.
A peripheral intravenous line and the central line was removed.
On postoperative day five, the patient was started on Reglan 10 mg q.6h.
and was started on Percocet.
The patient was also given Ambien as a sleep aid at night.
