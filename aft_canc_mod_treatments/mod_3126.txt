Altered mental status: Well below baseline at presentation.
On admission he was started on meropenem, vancomycin and acyclovir given concern for meningitis/encephalitis.
He did not have an LP night of admission because of concern for baclofen pump related complications.
He clinically improved after recieving lorazepam but had already been started on Abx.
Meropenem and Flagyl were stopped after seven days as he had clinically improved, and the inflammation seen on CT abd/pelvis was non-specific and thought unlikely to be contributing.
Vancomycin was continued to treat for Enterococcus and he should complete a 2-week course.
He had not been treated for Stenotrophomonas with Bactrim but as he had clinically improved by the time this result returned in the urine culture, it is doubtful that it contributed significantly to his presentation.
Heme thought likely underlying MDS worsened by acute infection, and his platelet count improved with ongoing treatment of infection.
He was treated with Vancomycin for the Enterococcus, but as he had improved clinically by the time the Stenotrophomas grew out and had not been treated with Bactrim, this was not initiated.
OSA: Continued on home CPAP but pt.
taking oxcarbazepine for Sz's at home.
Carbamazepine level here undetectable, most likely because pt.
Unknown etiology given no Hx of DM and not taking insulin or hypoglycemics.
Possibly surreptitious insulin administration, insulinoma or more likely poor PO intake.
C-peptide pending, insulin level and IGF levels normal.
Given that his mental status does not seem to necessarily improve when he is not bradycardic, there is no indication for pacemaker so cardiology consult for this issue was deferred.
