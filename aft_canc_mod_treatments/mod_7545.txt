Admission Date:  [**2174-3-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2174-4-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-12-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: 66% atypical white blood cells and low platelets on a routine CBC.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation  History of Present Illness: History of Present Illness: The pt is a 78 yo M with a h/o CAD, HTN, HL, DM who presents from his PCP's office after routine CBC showed 66% atypical white blood cells and low platelets on a routine CBC.
He initially sought care from his PCP after he had noticed that he had noticed increased bleeding from the site of a removed childhood skin tumor which had been severely pruritic, causing him to scratch it with a sharp back-scratcher repeatedly.
He was given 10u of cryoprecpitate and transfused platelets.
He also received 50 mg PO of all-trans retinoic acid.
Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: Received radiation as child to back for "tumors".
He has had several prior employments, including journalism, dance, stage management, and travel reporter.
Pertinent Results: Admission labs: [**2174-3-17**] 04:55PM BLOOD WBC-5.3 RBC-3.96* Hgb-11.9* Hct-32.8* MCV-83 MCH-30.2 MCHC-36.4* RDW-14.9 Plt Ct-22*# [**2174-3-18**] 10:00AM BLOOD PT-16.1* PTT-22.0 INR(PT)-1.4* [**2174-3-17**] 04:55PM BLOOD UreaN-22* Creat-1.2 Na-137 K-4.5 Cl-99 HCO3-28 AnGap-15 [**2174-3-17**] 04:55PM BLOOD Glucose-143* [**2174-3-18**] 05:32PM BLOOD ALT-24 AST-33 LD(LDH)-483* AlkPhos-68 TotBili-1.0  Brief Hospital Course: 78 yo male with distant history of stable angina, new diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia, transferred to the ICU with tachycardia after ATRA treatment on the hematology malignancy floor, with DIC, pulmonary edema, and delirium.
He was treated with ATRA and subsequently suffered from ATRA syndrome with an acute elevation in his WBC to >50 K. He had significant pulmonary leak.
He was treated with ATRA throughout and received Idarubicin which had to be stopped secondary to elevated bilirubin.
His blasts and WBC subsequently decreased, and on smear [**2174-4-4**] his myelocytes showed differentiation with improving status of his leukemia.
He was treated with allopurinol initially, and required a 1x dose of Rasburicase which led to the resolution of his TLS.
He was maintained on his allopurinol for continued treatment.
His mental status was the largest obstacle to extubation and he was taken for tracheotomy tube placement by Thoracic Surgery on [**2174-4-8**].
He tolerated the procedure well, and was able to be transitioned to trach collar starting on [**2174-4-10**] for periods of time.
He was intubated due hypoxia and increased work of breathing on [**2174-3-26**].
His CXR after intubation showed a fluffy infiltrate suggestive of either ARDS or hemorrhage (likely both).
# Toxic Metabolic Encephalopathy: He started experiencing a decline in mental status 2 days prior to intubation with severe asterixis and confusion.
He required several doses of Haldol and intermittent restraints for safety prior to intubation, when he was put on midazolam and Fentanyl drips.
5 days after intubation his was sedation was discontinued and he remained obtunded.
He was treated with dialysis for a uremia over 200.
He was treated allopurinol and Rasburicase for TLS with good resolution as well as with CVVH initially (1 day) for fluid removal.
Shortly after he began autodiuresing He was initiated on dialysis for AMS as described above and a BUN of greater than 200.
He was treated with dialysis with a fall in BUN to 113, however, he had a fever to 100.6 and cultures came back positive for GPC in chains from dialysis catheter [**2174-4-9**].
# Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: In the setting of acute volume overload from large volume transfusions given DIC as above.
Surgery was consulted and felt that as long as he was making urine there was no need for surgical intervention (as well as given his critical illness, it was not indicated).
He was started on CVVH as above and had 3L removed.
His CVVH was stopped and he was allowed to diurese on his own with support of lasix and metolazone as needed.
His HR did not respond to Diltiazem drip or multiple subsequent IV boluses of Diltiazem and Metoprolol.
He was loaded with Amiodarone drip and bolus of 150 mg x2.
He was cardioverted on [**2174-3-22**] and continued on Amiodarone.
He got an extra 150mg of amiodarone on [**3-25**] with minimal effect on tachycardia.
In the setting of controlling his blood pressure with IV medications he received multiple doses of metoprolol and labetalol, and he converted to NSR.
However, [**4-1**] he converted back to rapid a-fib with RVR and required uptitration of his B-blockade and a diltiazem drip which was eventually converted back to PO.
Neurosurgery preferred medical management with antiepileptics and reversal of his coagulopathy.
They felt that medical management and blood pressure control were the best means of treatment.
# Positive Blood Cultures: Blood cultures were positive in [**2-16**] bottles from his PICC line on [**2174-3-22**].
He was started on Vancomycin / Meropenem on [**2174-3-22**] after spiking a fever to 102.5.
This was changed to Vancomycin / Cefepime the next day.
Given the concern for translocation of gut bacteria with his compromised immune system, he was switched to Vancomycin / Zosyn on [**2174-3-24**] for better coverage of gut pathogens.
Micafungin was added to cover for fungal pathogens.
He had multiple sets of negative surveillance cultures, and his antibiotics were continued while he remained neutropenic.
He had a fever to 100.6 on [**2174-4-9**] and cultures were drawn from his dialysis catheter which were positive for GPCs in chains.
His catheter was pulled and he was continued on vancomycin.
He initially required 10 mg IV diazepam several times and started on a CIWA scale.
On RUQ imaging for persistent elevation of his bilirubin, cirrhosis was noted.
More than likely his cirrhosis was secondary to alcoholism and he had poor clearance of his bilirubin (from reabsorption from pooled blood).
His insulin coverage was briefly switched to an insulin drip, and he was subsequently converted to subcutaneous insulin based on his requirements.
His overall clinical status continued to decline over the course of hospitalization, with evolution of multi-system organ failure including increased pulmonary ventilatory requirements, persistant renal failure, LFTs continued to increase and he developed recurrent bacteremia (initially MSSA, then VRE).
He was given 1 dose of daptomycin for VRE coverage.
