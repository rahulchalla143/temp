He had been experiencing fever to 102 and worsening, "unbearable" myalgias at home, and ID and Rheum outpatient providers recommended inpatient eval for FUO.
Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who followed him through the admission and brokered the transfer to our ICU, an extensive infectious workup including several blood cultures, TTE, negative-quantiferon, bronch, fungal Cx, malaria, babesiosis, erlichia, mycoplasma, and more, was unrevealing, with the exception of "possible PCP" on a bronchial washing that was otherwise "benign" (he was started on atovaquone, with uncertain clinical response).
He was given IV levofloxacin, vancomycin and doxycycline for about a week, with no response (persistent fever).
With the lack of identified infectious etiology and the lack of response to broad-spectrum antibacterial treatment, and with the background of undifferentiated autoimmune vasculitis (he was continued on 20mg daily prednisone through all this), they tried an empiric 3-day course of IV methylprednisolone followed by 80mg prednisone daily.
He exhibited an excellent clinical response, per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to the steroids, although it is not yet clear to me based on the timing whether giving atovaquone for PCP may have played a role.
For this, he was treated with 40mg [**Hospital1 **] Lovenox for the past ~5 days.
OSH had planned to discharge him on Lovenox and prednisone taper and atovaquone (in addition to prior meds), but then the aforementioned hemorrhagic stroke occurred, so he was put in the ICU, re-imaged and then transferred here.
Before transfer, his Lovenox was held and he was given FFP x3U and protamine IV as well as a platelet transfusion due to mild thrombocytopenia to the 70s-80s.
Arterial and venous mid-to-small vessel vasculitis, on chronic prednisone.
Gout on colchicine 4.
History of gadolinium IV infiltration in fall of [**2189**]; patient and family think his soft tissue swelling and "migratory thrombophelbitis" has 5.
The patient had been hospitalized for investigation of a fever of unknown origin in the setting of his vasculitis on chronic prednisone therapy and his MDS with interval finding of a BAL suspicious for but not confirmatory of Pneumocystic jirovecii infection (for which he was switched from Atovaquone daily to [**Hospital1 **] dosage) and a left gastrocnemius vein DVT, left deep brachial DVT, and left median cubital superficial thrombophlebitis for which he was started on Enoxaparin 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].
He was on anticoagulation with aspirin for five days up until the day of expected discharge when he developed the aforementioned symptoms.
His initial NCHCT showed a small inferior left frontal IPH with small associated SDH that on repeat imaging that evening appeared to have an interval progression in size (1x2cm to 2x3cm) without any change in neurologic exam.
His anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy were stopped.
While on the floor, he was continued on his prednisone/atovaquone/colchicine regimen and his speech continued to improve.
He received a formal speech/swallow evaluation who advanced his diet to regular foods and recommended an extended course of speech rehabilitation which he will continue as an outpatient.
We had recommended a conventional angiogram to obtain a precise picture of his intracranial vasculature out of concern for a vasculitic process versus AVM/vascular anomalies that may explain his parenchmyal hemorrhage.
Our recommendations were made clear to the patient and his family, that he receive a conventional angiogram in the immediate future ESPECIALLY if he is to resume anticoagulation.
- He was continued on atovaquone therapy, and this was switched to once daily dosing on discharge as a part of his PCP prophylaxis regimen.
He remained on prednisone 60mg on the day of his discharge, and was given instructions to downtitrate to 20mg daily over the next 3-4 days based on recommendations from our rheumatology colleagues.
