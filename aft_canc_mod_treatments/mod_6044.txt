HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58 year old male with a history of stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer treated with multiple modalities who presents with one week history of shortness of breath.
During clinic visit on [**2156-3-25**], plan was to further look into radiation therapy as treatment, as well as to perform full staging with magnetic resonance scan of the head as well as bone scan.
The patient was taken to the catheterization laboratory and pericardiocentesis was performed with subsequent placement of a pericardial drain.
Stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2154**], with metastases to the brain, status post right upper lobe wedge resection with preoperative chemotherapy and postoperative radiation therapy, status post thoracic radiation therapy, status post solitary brain metastasis resection with whole brain radiation, status post chemotherapy with Carboplatin/Taxol times three.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Lopressor 50 mg p.o.
The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly, subxiphoid drain in place, clean, dry and intact.
Right groin catheter removed, no bruit or hematoma noted.
Pericardial fluid with a total protein of 6.2, LDH 3960, albumin 3.6, glucose 34, amylase 33 and culture and cytology were pending.
Pericardiocentesis was performed with removal of approximately 500 ccs of bloody fluid.
IMPRESSION:  A 58 year old male, with history of stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2154**], metastatic to brain, status post multiple modality treatment, presents with five week history of hoarseness and subsequent detection of a right upper lobe mass with lymph node involvement.
The patient studied for radiation therapy mapping and noted to have large pericardial fluid collection in the setting of recent shortness of breath requiring pericardiocentesis and subsequent drain placement.
Cardiac - Pericardium - Pericardial drain was left in overnight on hospital day number one.
The patient at this time continued to have moderate output of fluid and decision was made to continue drain placement until the following day at which point if fluid output had decreased, the drain would be pulled.
On hospital day number three, minimal drainage was noted and the drain was removed and the patient was transferred to the medical [**Hospital1 **].
In addition, lastly the patient was initially well hydrated with intravenous fluids to maintain preload in light of his tamponade physiology.
Oncology - As above, the patient with a history of nonsmall cell lung cancer and was being mapped for radiation therapy secondary to recurrence and now with a malignant pericardial effusion.
In speaking with the patient's outpatient oncologist, the patient to receive chemotherapy and radiation therapy as treatment for his recurrence in the setting of mild superior vena cava compression.
Hypertension - The patient's Lopressor dose was initially held on admission to the CCU, however, with slightly elevated blood pressure off his medication, Lopressor was restarted and at the time of discharge, the patient was at his usual outpatient dose of 50 mg Lopressor p.o.
Stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Lopressor 50 mg p.o.
FOLLOW-UP: 1.
Follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], oncology, for further management of the patient's oncologic issues.
