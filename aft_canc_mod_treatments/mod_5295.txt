Patient will need maintenance chemo, but was awaiting stabilization of ID status prior to starting further chemo.
They asked for several cultures including acid fast bacilli, legionella, etc.
Patient underwent thoracentesis on [**8-30**], which showed exudative fluid that grew afb in cultures, although the afb smear was negative.
Patient started on 4 drug anti-tuberculosis regimen on [**9-8**].
When patient returned to BMT, he was placed on Rifabutin, Ethambutol, Pyridoxine, Clarithromycin for MAC coverage, as TB+ blood cxs likely MAC vs. TB, anti-TB meds d/ced, other atypical mycobacteria was also a consideration.
Patient was started on Vanc empirically on [**9-17**] as blood cultures from [**9-15**] returned [**2-14**] gram + cocci=coag neg staph and those from [**9-17**].
In addition, pleural fluid from [**9-12**] returned TB PCR positive, therefore patient's abx regimen changed back to 4 drug anti-tuberculosis coverage.
Patient underwent repeat thorax CT, which showed enlarging abdominal LN and an increasing number of splenic and liver lesions.
Amikacin was added to help potentiated anti-TB drug effects, however this was later discontinued, along with the clarithromycin, so that patient was only on anti-TB coverage.
The patient was placed on an 11 week steroid taper (beginning with 60mg prednisone daily) per ID recs to help lessen risk of constrictive pericarditis.
Patient was arranged with follow-up in the [**Hospital **] clinic in [**Month (only) 359**], and will be followed by the state center for tuberculosis as well for medication administration.
Cardiology: Patient developed AFib w/ rapid response to 180's, and unstable BP (SBP=90's) - therefore was transferred to the ICU on [**9-11**] where he underwent unsuccessful attempts at cardioversion x3.
He was intubated and brought to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
He was found to be hypotensive, probably due to the decreased preload in the setting of intubation and the use of Propofol for intubation.
BP improved when he was switched over to Fentanyl for sedation.
He was started on Levofloxacin, Flagyl and Vancomycin for tx of an suspected pneumonia.
A therapeutic thoracentesis was done the next day and respiratory state improved significantly.
The ARF resolved within a day and was attributed to intravascular fluid depletion.
Cardiology also recommended continued diuresis for pleural and pericardial effusions.
Patient was monitored by glucose FS TID and covered with RISS and Lantus.
On [**8-20**] pt seen by [**Last Name (un) **] team and recs for BG control changed, scale adjusted and FS levels improved.
[**Last Name (un) **] followed patient throughout hospitalization and upon discharge, patient was given diabetic education by nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] monitoring and insulin administration.
A PICC was therefore placed and pt was started on TPN w/ boost supplementation and liberal po intake as tolerated.
A calorie count on [**10-9**] per nutrition showed that patient was eating 1450 calories per day, and TPN was discontinued on [**10-10**].
As such, on [**9-22**] a mixing study was sent (elevated PT), vit K given - mixing study negative.
