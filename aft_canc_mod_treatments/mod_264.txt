Congestive heart failure, with multi-chamber cardiac enlargement and bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette is unchanged, with left pacemaker and two intracardiac leads.
Fluid overload, with anasarca and moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
Metoprolol and terazosin were held throughout admission which patient tolerated well.
He has had several positive C Diff toxin assays, and had one course of treatment after an [**Month (only) 547**] admission.
He was C diff toxin positive again and he was treated with IV flagyl and PO vancomycin as his diarrhea was severe and there was concern about the vancomycin working in the setting of a rapid transit time.
Antibiotics were started on [**7-2**] with a plan to complete a 21 day course of flagyl and vanco as an outpatient.
#Perirectal Abscess-Seen on CT, non-symptomatic but on exam he had tender fluctuance in the posterior rectum.
Gen [**Doctor First Name **] was consulted and stated I&D at this time is not necessary as it could not be performed bedside, because of the position of the abscess they may have to use a percutaneous approach which would raise concern about creating a colon-skin fistual tract.
They recommended added cipro for gram negative coverage but given concern over exacerbating his c.diff which was already slow to improve, it was not added and conservatively management was pursued.
He has a normal LVEF, but has had recent issues with fluid overload-likely [**2-23**] MR, TR.
He was diuresed with IV lasix 4-5L, now patient is lasix dose of 40mg daily.
He had a CTA with bilateral subsegmental PEs, nonobstructive and an IVC filter was placed on [**7-10**] given inability to anticoagulate due to known colon malignancy.
He was continued on home amiodarone.
