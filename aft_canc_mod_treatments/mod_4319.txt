Brief Hospital Course: 87 yoM with CLL with baseline WBC around 50,000, HTN, prior TIA (unknown details), DM, CRI, dementia, transferred from [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] with new right leg weakness; .
Since pt was unable to follow directions for an MRI without sedation and possible intubation, and the management would not be affected, the MRI was not done at the OSH.
The patient was continued on aspirin 325 mg qday.
He ultimately required transfer to the MICU and intubation for ventilatory support.
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for a possible aspiration pneumonia and improved gradually over the ensuing days.
He was later started his amlodipine at 5mg.
# Nutrition: The patient was supported with enteral feeding via NGT due to his risk of aspiration s/p CVA.
Hypernatremia was attributed to volume depletion and improved with IV fluids and NG tube free water flushes.
Treated with beta-blockade.
# DVT prophylaxis was with subQ heparin.
Prior to the transfer, however, the patient was to have a Dobhoff tube placed so that he could receive post-pyloric tube feeds theoretically lowering his risk of subsequent aspiration.
The [**Name8 (MD) 228**] RN was settling him back in bed when ~4:30 pm the RN ([**Doctor First Name **]) witnessed the patient to be snoring and then take a deep breath and stop breathing.
Oxygen was placed on the patient but he had ceased to breathe.
