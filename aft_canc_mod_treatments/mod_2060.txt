A right internal jugular Cordis catheter and right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter are present.
IMPRESSION: Tubes and lines as described above.
A pre-procedure time checklist confirming patient identity and the procedure to be done was performed.
Under sterile technique and ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle and a wire was passed into the superior vena cava (SVC) under fluoroscopic guidance.
The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture sheath.
Venograms were obtained in two projections (AP and LAO caudo- cranial) with the catheter tip in the right hepatic vein.
Then, transcatheter pressure measurements were obtained at multiple levels in this vein and in the IVC.
The catheter was then exchanged over the wire for a 5 French pigtail catheter, which was advanced under fluoroscopy in the IVC up to the level of the renal veins, and a cavogram was obtained.
The findings were then discussed in person with the transplant team and no intervention was performed.
