She recently was found to have a right sided pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis with 2100 ml of fluid removed on [**2119-11-29**].
Her week 3 Taxol dose was held this day due to the pleural effusion.
Past Medical History: - Metastatic breast cancer (1) a right frontal craniotomy for resection of the metastasis by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 548**], M.D.
on [**2117-12-23**] (2) Cyberknife radiosurgery to the 1-right frontal lobe resection cavity to 2400 cGy (800 cGy x 3 fractions) at 84% isodose line from [**2118-1-26**] to [**2118-1-28**] (3) lumbar puncture on [**2118-6-23**] showed 0 WBC, 31 protein, and negative cytology for malignant cells (4) status post Cyberknife radiosurgery on [**2118-7-6**] at 2-right frontal metastasis to [**2108**] cGy at 70% isodose line and 3-left frontal metastasis to 2200 cGy at 77% isodose line.
She does not have headache, nausea, vomiting, seizure, imbalance, or fall.
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19**] will change her navelbine treatment to possibly Doxil.
She underwent a left mastectomy with none of 11 lymph nodes positive for tumor.
She was then treated with Faslodex from [**2114-11-6**] to [**2115-8-13**].
A right upper lobe transbronchial biopsy on [**2115-6-26**] showed adenocarcinoma, and her treatment was switched to Xeloda on [**2115-12-18**].
A gadolinium-enhanced head MRI on [**2117-12-21**] showed a right frontal enhancing mass with surrounding cerebral edema, mass effect, and 2 mm of midline shift.
She had a craniotomy by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 548**], M.D.
on [**2117-12-23**] for resection of the right frontal mass.
She then had another session of Cyberknife radiosurgery on [**2118-7-6**] at 2-right frontal metastasis to [**2108**] cGy at 70% isodose line and 3-left frontal metastasis to 2200 cGy at 77% isodose line.

Right chest tube has been inserted in the interim after pleuroscopy with interval decrease in the right pleural effusion.
Talc pleurodesis was performed on [**2119-12-4**] by the IP service.
She was drained daily, however got to the point where her drain was not removing fluid on 3 consecutive days so her PleurX catheter was removed by the IP service on [**12-12**].
A stitch was placed that needs to be removed in 2 weeks.
# Hypotension: Following the procedure, the patient was still sedated and hypotensive and started on neo drip.
Antibiotics were not started given lack of fever and no localizing symptoms.
The patient was volume resuscitated while being maintained on pressors.
Because of her prolonged pressor requirement and use of steroids as an outpatient, she was also started on hydrocort in the event of adrenal insufficiency despite normal AM cortisol.
The patient's blood pressures were stable on the Oncology floor off of hydrocortisone and a random cortisol was 25 - it was felt it would be very unlikely for her to have adrenal insufficiency in that setting.
She required periodic fluid boluses to keep adequate urine output.
The patient was hypoxic post procedure, and initially needed supplemental O2.
Continue PO diet of thin liquids and regular consistency solids.
This was likely related to her poor PO intake and continued use of Glimepiride at home.
Her Glimepiride was held during her stay and she was placed on a Humalog insulin sliding scale.
Her Glimepiride was stopped on discharge pending PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 4939**].
# Seizure History: She was continued on Levetiracetam 1000 mg QAM, 500 mg at noon, and 1000 mg QPM.
# Depression / Insomnia: She was continued on her home Sertraline 150 mg PO daily and Lorazepam 0.5 mg PO Q6H PRN.
# DVT Prophylaxis: Heparin 5000 units SC TID .

The effusion was drained and talc pleurodesis was performed to help prevent the fluid from reaccumulating.
Your chest tube stopped draining fluid so it was removed.
As you are not a candidate for surgery at this time, they felt that stool bulking agents such as fiber and loperamide are the best options at this time.
