The patient was restarted on the Decadron that she was noncompliant with.
The patient was started on Mannitol and Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis and transferred to the ICU for bedside bur hole drainage of these mets because she was becoming bradycardiac and hypertensive.
The patient was intubated and remained intubated for two days following the procedure and then was extubated without difficulty.
She became more competent to discuss her medical care at that point.
The Dilantin was changed to Keppra because she continued to receive whole brain radiation treatment during these episodes and the goal is to complete a course, three from the outside hospital and seven while she is here in the hospital.
There has been association between Dilantin and whole brain radiation leading to [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome so she was switched to Keppra.
BREAST CANCER:  The patient, as she became more alert, expressed her wishes that she would not like to proceed any further with chemotherapy treatment and that she felt that she could not handle any more treatments.
PAIN:  Well controlled with the Fentanyl patch 75 micrograms and Dilaudid was used for breakthrough pain as needed.
