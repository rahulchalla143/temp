He was referred to Cardiac Surgery for a possible aortic valve replacement plus or minus CABG.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  His past medical history is as follows:  Coronary artery disease status post MI in [**2195**] and PCI/stent to the LAD; aortic stenosis, [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.6 centimeter squared in [**2195**]; hypertension; acute renal failure after PCI in [**2195**], he was on dialysis, but not presently, with a creatinine of 2.5 to 4.0; hypercholesterolemia; prostate cancer status post radical prostatectomy and radiation treatment; anemia, the patient is on Epogen; COPD.
He is also status post MRSA UTI.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  The patient is status post cholecystectomy, status post right THR x2, status post urinary tract revision with sphincter.
Lopressor 5 mg q.d.
Allopurinol 150 mg q.d.
Casodex 150 mg q.d.
Felodipine 5 mg q.d.
Humulin 70/30 25 units q.a.m.
and NPH 20 units at dinner.
So, on hospital day number 2, the patient was seen by Infectious Disease for a possible source of infection secondary to increased hematuria and fever, and Cardiac Surgery continued to follow up until given consent was okayed for surgery.
There were no DVTs found on the Doppler examination, no evidence of abnormality, and the day earlier, the patient was seen by Dental and was cleared for surgery as per Dental.
On hospital day number 9, which was [**2197-9-26**], the patient appeared to be ready for his CABG and AVR in the near future.
Following a Urology consult, the patient will need a suprapubic tube placed as a urethral catheter could cause erosion of urethra and also need recommendations from Urology to comment on when full authorization for cardiopulmonary bypass is safe status post a placement of the suprapubic catheter.
Throughout the last nine days of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, he has been followed by Medicine, Cardiology, Nephrology, Infectious Disease, Physical Therapy, and Hematology/Oncology in the need to find any source of infection following his renal status and following his CHF status and his anemia.
The patient has also received several blood transfusions secondary to a decreased hematocrit during the last week.
On [**2197-9-28**], which was hospital day number 11, the patient had a Foley inserted with the help of cystoscopy and pelvic ultrasound guidance, and was planned for surgery the next day, which would be [**2197-9-29**].
Cardiac Surgery had done this.
The procedure was coronary artery bypass graft x2.
The grafts were LIMA to LAD and saphenous vein graft to OM.
The patient also received aortic valve replacement with a 21-mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial tissue valve.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
He was receiving epinephrine drip of 0.02 mcg/kg per minute, nitroglycerin at 0.5 mg, insulin at 2 units per hour, and propofol 20 mg en route to the CSIU.
On postoperative day number 1, the patient was still receiving the following drips:  Insulin of 1 unit, milrinone of 0.5 mg, Natrecor of 0.01 mg, and propofol of 25 mg.
On postoperative day number 2, the patient was still receiving milrinone at 0.3 mg now, which was down from 0.5 mg, insulin of 4 units, Natrecor of 0.01 mg, and he was on 40 mg of Lasix intravenously.
He had received 1 unit of packed red blood cells secondary to a decrease in his hematocrit, and we have been slowing weaning his milrinone.
On physical examination, he was unremarkable, and his milrinone was decreased to 0.2 mg.  On postoperative day number 3, the patient was still receiving insulin drip before milrinone of 0.2 mg and Natrecor of 0.01 mg.
Urology recommended to remove his Foley today, which was done so, and a condom catheter with artificial sphincter in the open position was in place.
The plan was to recheck a x-ray to see if there was any expansion, which was not of his pneumothorax, and to wean his milrinone and to check the hepatic panel.
On postoperative day number 4, which was hospital day number 12, the patient was transferred to the Inpatient Telemetry floor, and his milrinone was weaned off.
He was still receiving Natrecor at 0.1 mg and Lasix at 40 mg t.i.d.
The plan was to discontinue his Natrecor, start Lopressor, and remove his epicardial pacing wires.
The plan was to increase his Lopressor to 50 mg b.i.d., decrease his Lasix to 40 mg b.i.d., continue monitoring of his creatinine, and have Rehab Physical Therapy screen the patient in Cardiac Intensive Care.
The patient was also being seen by physicians from [**Last Name (un) **] secondary to his blood glucose and diabetes management better under control.
His sternum was stable, and incision was clear, dry, and intact.
Lasix was changed to p.o., and the plan was to have Urology consulted to see the patient again secondary to the urinary sphincter, and now that the patient was on p.o.
His Lopressor was increased to 75 mg p.o.
Following cardiac surgery, his course improved dramatically, and he was discharged postoperatively from cardiac surgery on day number 10.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  His discharge diagnoses are as follows: His coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft x2, aortic stenosis status post aortic valve replacement with 21-mm pericardial tissue valve, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal insufficiency, prostate cancer status post radical prostatectomy and radiation treatment, anemia, and the patient is on Epogen, urinary tract revision with sphincter.
RECOMMENDATIONS:  The patient was recommended a follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two to three weeks, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25059**] in two to three weeks, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in four weeks.

Hydromorphone 2 mg p.o.
Insulin 70/30 units per millimeter suspension.
The    patient was told to take 32 units subcutaneously once a    day, and insulin NPH, the patient is told to take 18 units    subcutaneous at bedtime.
