She was made NPO, and was started on IV fluids, pantoprazole 40 mg IV BID, and Q6H Hct checks.
# Sepsis: Based on her HR and WBC count, she met SIRS criteria on admission with the most likely source of her infection being a UTI given her positive UA.
She was treated with ciprofloxacin x 5 days.
She completed a course of ciprofloxacin with extended coverage of her prior c-diff infection with oral vancomycin.
Since she was receiving transfusions and taking iron supplementation, her iron was discontinued to prevent iron toxicity from repeated transfusions.
She was seen by heme-onc during this admission, who recommended additional blood tests.
She previously was thought to have coagulalopathy of anoxeria on previous admission.
She received vitamin K with improvement in her INR.
# Chronic DVT/PE: Her home lovenox was held because of her presumed GI bleed.
She was restarted on enoxaparin on discharge.
# C. diff: She was started on oral vancomycin on [**6-14**] at [**Hospital1 95707**], given need for abx for her UTI.
Her vancomycin course for c. diff needs to be extended with a start date when she finishes her cipro course.
She is set to finish her cipro on [**2123-6-26**] and oral vancomycin should continue until [**2123-7-10**].
She was continued on antibiotics and anti-coagulation for management of her chronic issues.
