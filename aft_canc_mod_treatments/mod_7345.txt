She has required previous transfusions related to decreased hematocrit from CLL.
Urology evaluated the patient and recommended watching the cultures and fever curve and continuing antibiotics and intravenous hydration.
Her tuberculosis medications were discontinued, secondary to concerns for INH exacerbating her acidosis as well as concern that multiple medications have been previously implicated as a cause of acute interstitial nephritis.
The Ciprofloxacin was dosed for her estimated creatinine clearance for her urinary tract infection.
She received intravenous fluids with b1 to attempt to compensate for her acidosis and her chemistries and arterial blood gases were monitored.
Renal felt there were multiple possible causes for the acute episode of renal failure, including infection, dehydration, medications and chronic obstruction.
The patient continued to receive intravenous fluids with bicarbonate as well as Ciprofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection and her creatinine continued to improve.
There was an ongoing discussion between the renal service, urology service and medicine service, with regards to help as to handle this episode of renal failure.
There was discussion of a possibility of a percutaneous nephrostomy for the right kidney, in order to attempt to relieve the obstruction and hence preserve some kidney function and stave off the need for ultimate dialysis.
This option was presented to the patient and a discussion of the risks and benefits of that procedure was discussed.
Over the week-end of the [**11-16**], the patient developed persistent wheezing that was not particularly responsive to Albuterol and Atrovent nebs.
Since her bicarbonate had normalized, intravenous fluids with bicarbonate were held.
Given the absence of history of lung disease, the wheezing was preliminarily presumed to be a cardiac wheeze, as a result of hydration for the renal failure.
By this point, her creatinine had continued to fall and was now under 3.0 so the decision was made to add some Lasix diuresis prn in order to improve her congestive heart failure.
The patient responded beautifully to small doses of intravenous Lasix in the range of 20 mg and was easily diuresed about negative half a liter per day for several days.
She was maintained on oxygen at all times, including during ambulation, given her low P02.
The leading theory was still that intravenous fluids with bicarbonate as well as the transfusion she had required early in her stay for anemia had caused a fluid overload and the heart failure was the cause of her respiratory difficulty.
She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit that evening for her respiratory distress and maintained on ventilatory support.
A right internal jugular line was placed and she was briefly put on pressors for low blood pressure.
The patient was started on Meropenem while in the unit, in order to cover for possible pathogens.
The patient improved and was weaned off pressors and was extubated on [**11-23**].
She did very well on nasal cannula oxygen following extubation and was transferred back to the floor on [**11-24**].
She was maintained on her nebs, continued on Lasix diuresis, and given chest physical therapy.
The patient was placed on intravenous Ceftazidime and thought that perhaps this represented a pneumonia and that she might improve with antibiotics.
Nevertheless, empiric trial of Flagyl was tried in an attempt to improve her symptoms.
The care team felt that a short stay in pulmonary rehabilitation would be beneficial to her and she agreed.
