Patient required pressors and was intubated in anticipation for ERCP.
On [**2119-11-10**] a percutaneous cholecystostomy was placed by IR.
Patient had a CT a/p on [**2119-11-12**] to r/o RP bleed due to hematocrit drop which was negative for bleed however did show that perc chole drain was in atypical position.
IR evaluated imaging and determined that drain has been dislodged.
New drain not placed as would be difficult per IR now that gall bladder decompressed.
Bilirubin had improved but then began to increase again over past two days, now 5.
Patient has been on empiric broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin/cefepime/flagyl.

Cholecystostomy tube appears in an atypical position; a call to the team confirmed that it was draining large amount of bilious fluid; if clinical concern for it becoming displaced increases (ie, drainage ceases), a tube check should be considered.
Small-to-moderate intraabdominal fluid is simple in nature and tracks along paracolic gutters and into the pelvis.
For cholangitis, had ERCP, which did not show definitive source; later had PTC placement given diverticulum and possible etiology of infection.
Surgery did not feel cholecystectomy was indicated because repeat imaging did not suggest cholecystitis.
Pt's vanc/cefepime/flagyl were discontinued on [**11-20**] due to absence of signs or symptoms of infection.
Patient was treated with 4 ventilator associated pneumonia.
The patient was started on IV micafungin.
The patient continued to require IV pressors throughout her entire hospital course and medical ICU.
We were unable to successfully wean the patient off her pressor support.
A percutaneous cholecystostomy tube was placed a second time by interventional radiology.
[**Month (only) 116**] represent ARF from septic shock, resolved to Cr 1.0, however elevated again in setting of diuresis to 1.4.
She required both hemodialysis and CVVH throughout the stay.
The renal service was following the patient and provided recommendations for her dialysis treatments.
# Anemia: pt required 1 unit PRBC on [**11-11**].
CT a/p was done to eval for RP bleed in setting of intra-abdominal procedures above.
Patient required multiple blood transfusions throughout her stay for a slow down-trending hematocrit.
The patient was started on Keppra with some minimal improvement in her mental status.
The patient was sensitive to carotid massage.
She required both IVP to blockade and calcium channel blockers for rate control if carotid massage did not lower her heart rate.
#Nutrition: The patient was started on tube feeding shortly after arriving in the medical ICU.
She was eventually extubated but remained somewhat hypoxic and required high oxygen requirements most of the time she was in the medical ICU.
The patient's fluid status was maintained by hemodialysis and she received a treatment of antibiotics for ventilator associated pneumonia.
Throughout most of the family meetings the daughter maintained that she wanted to continue full treatment of the patient.
At that time the daughter agreed that the patient should be made comfort measures only.
The patient was weaned from the pressors and given IV analgesia for comfort.
