She was admitted to the ICU and was aggressively rehydrated for hypernatremia, and was started on an insulin drip with subsequent resolution of her hyperglycemia within 24 hours.
She was transitioned to a subcutaneous basal/bolus insulin regimen on HD 2 and was transferred to the floor on HD3.
While tapering her steroids was initially considered, after speaking to her neurologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**], it was decided to continue her decadron at her previous dose of 4mg [**Hospital1 **], as she has significant cerebral edema related to the meningioma that would likely worsen in the event of a taper and lead to further neurologic deficit.
# Hypernatremia - Her corrected sodium 167 on admission.
Her acute unresponsiveness was related to her hyperosmolar state, which recovered with appropriate treatment.
She does have baseline dementia, which after speaking to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] and [**Location (un) 1131**] OMR notes, was thought to be related to XRT therapy for her meningioma.
Goals of care: Patient was receiving hospice care at home at the time of admission, however, she remained a full code throughout the hospitalization which was confirmed with her HCP.
She will continue her dexamethasone per recommendation of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] and will follow up with him as an outpatient.
# Hyperlipidemia - her lipitor was held due to elevated LFTs as described above.
