An Argon-Plasma Coagulator was applied for hemostasis successfully.
Lower GI bleed: With BRBPR seen on digital rectal exam, negative NGL in ED, increased vascularity of distal rectum consistent with known radiation proctitis (also seen in [**3-/2158**] colonoscopy) and also grade 1 internal hemorrhoids seen on colonoscopy 2 wks ago, most likely source is lower GI tract/rectum.
Hct was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells and the hematocrit bumped appropriately to 25 at time of discharge.
GI was consulted and felt that the bleeding was likely due to scar tissue breaking off from the rectum after the recent argon-plasma beam coagulation treatment for the radiation proctitis.
Hypotension also resolved quickly with IVF resuscitation.
Home beta blocker and ACEi held but were held initially but can be restarted after discharge.
