She was also started on Solu Medrol on [**11-15**] for four days for unclear reasons.
She became less ventilatory dependent and tolerated pressure support of 5 with a PEEP of 0.
Was restarted on Dopamine and Dobutamine on [**11-24**] through [**11-27**].

Hypotension - initially responded well to intravenous fluids but remained hypotensive despite CVP's in the 20's.
By [**2145-12-6**] she was still requiring Levo and Dopamine to maintain pressures.
Holding Digoxin and had pacer pads placed in case she bradycardia down again.
However, by [**12-6**] she had no bradycardiac episodes in the last 48 hours and was off the Heparin because she had a bleed at the right IJ Swann site a few days ago requiring one unit of packed red blood cells for a four point hematocrit drop.
Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] - with leukocytosis and thrombocytosis.
She was started on Hydroxyurea to treat the platelets and white blood cell count.
This did not improve even with a Lasix drip, Dobutamine or dopamine initially.

TSH was 20 on admission, did not get Synthroid for one month at the outside hospital.
Was loaded with intravenous Levoxyl and the T4-T3 came back to normal range on [**12-4**] therefore she was switched to p.o.
Stress dose steroids were weaned completely by [**2145-12-7**].
We attempted to minimize Ativan and Morphine throughout the admission.
Finally as recovery seemed futile and the patient had not responded to many days on antibiotics the decision was finally made to change her care to comfort measures.
This was done and the patient passed away peacefully on [**2145-12-8**] on a Morphine drip for pain.
