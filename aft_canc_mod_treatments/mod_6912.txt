She was started on vancomycin and meropenem.
Given she was afebrile, no leukocytosis and was hemodynamically stable vancomycin was discontinued two days into admission meropenem was continued for a 10 day course.
She was transferred to the ICU for further management.
She was started on BiPAP until her blood gas improved.
Her lasix was continued at 10mg daily and intake/output was monitored as well.
She continued to do well without need for further intervention.
Prior to discharge she was restarted on her home beta blocker (metoprolol succinate 12.5mg PO bid) with good BP control.
With conservative treatment creatinine improved to 1.4.
Ciprofloxacin and mesalamine was continued.
# MDS and Related Anemia: She was given 1U PRBC for hct 24, and weekly epogen was restarted on this admission.
The patient's daughter refused heparin (previous history of worsening thrombocytopenia w/use although HIT Ab negative) and pneumoboot to arm given patients poor skin condition.
Given her anemia and thrombocytopenia, her previous bloody stools, it was felt the risk of bleeding with anticoagulation was highter than her risk for worsening DVT or PE at this time.
Nursing wound care was continued per previous recommendations.
