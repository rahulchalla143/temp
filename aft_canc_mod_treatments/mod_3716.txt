Increased secretions likely secondary to radiation-induced scarring of upper airway and/or use of passe-muir valve and lack of humidified air through trach.
Levo/Flagyl started at [**Hospital1 **] switched to Zosyn, as well as improved trach care with humidified O2, q1-2hr suctioning, and trach change with inner cannula allowing frequent cleaning.
She should continue Zosyn for 4 additional days for a total 7 day course.
She should continue trach care as above with constant humidified O2, frequent suctioning and cleaning of inner canula, and spiriva nebulizers.
She should not use a Passe-Muir valve as this inhibits clearing of secretions.
She should then have speech and swallow evaluation for aspiration risk.
When previously seen by speech and swallow at [**Hospital1 18**] at last admission, she was deemed to be an aspiration risk, but this may have improved after radiation and chemotherapy.
Received 3 doses of XRT while inpatient.
She should continue chemo and XRT as per her primary oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

Needs speech and swallow evaluation at [**Hospital1 **]   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for increased secretions into your tracheostomy tube.
These may have been due to a combination of infection perhaps due to aspiration, drying of secretions due to radiation therapy, lack of humidified air through the trach, and use of passe-muir valve.
Your tracheostomy was changed to one with an inner canula which will allow for more frequent cleaning.
When previously seen by speech and swallow at [**Hospital1 18**] it was felt that you were aspirating secretions, but that may have improved now with radiation and chemotherapy.
You were started on an IV antibiotic called Zosyn which you should continue for 4 more days.
