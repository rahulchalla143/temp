On [**12-24**], pt was started on PO diltiazem for rate control in the setting of atrial flutter.
His oxygen has been weaned down to 2L NC with stable sats.
However, on [**12-28**] he became hypoxic due to a mucus plug and subsequent LUL collapse.
He recieved 2 bronchosopies which removed mucus plugs and relieved his LUL collapse.
He was hypotensive requiring dopamine for a short time.
Hydralazine was added for BP control.

He finished his ten day course of meropenem and vancomycin for a presumed pneumonia, and was to finish a ten day course of levaquin started later for double coverage of a presumed pneumonia.
He requires 4L NC for his O2 sats to be 95% resting.
He will be on a slow steroid taper to end at a maintence dose of 20 daily.
He should be maintained on BIPAP at night with the settings of [**10-31**].
He will continue with aggressive tx of COPD with albuterol, atrovent, advair, and prednisone to decrease inflammation in airways.

His Epo and Fe supplements were increased.
6. h/o DVT in [**2183**] - [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] team started holding lovenox on [**12-31**] due to decreasing HCT.
He was on lovenox 150mg sc daily on discharge from last hospitalization for DVT in [**10-2**]  His lovenox was restarted [**2185-1-1**] as Hct stable at very low dose 50 mg SC daily.
The level was 0.21 on this dose, therefore will increase Lovenox to 60 SC daily on discharge.
