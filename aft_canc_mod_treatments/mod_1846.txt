She was kept in the PACU overnight, and required pressor support initially.
Her post op CXR showed pneumothorax and extensive sub-q emphysema, so an additional chest tube was placed.
This tube put out 300 cc of fairly bloody output upon placement.
She did well there, and her pressor requirement was weaned off.
On the night of POD 1, she had an episode of acute delirium, which was controlled with anxiolytics and antipsychotic medications.
She had one episode of mild confusion and medication refusal, but this resolved on it's own.
When her chest tube was placed to water seal on POD 4, a pneumothorax reaccumulated, so it was put back to suction.
Throughout the admission pain was controlled with a thoracic epidural, until POD 5, when she was transitioned to PO pain medication.
Once on the floor she did much better, having her [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drains removed on POD 4, her chest tube was d/DC'ed on POD 5, with the resulting pneumothorax described above.
She was discharged home on POD 6 tolerating food, on oral pain medication with all her tubes d/c' ed.
