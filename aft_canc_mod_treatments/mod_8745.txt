There is an NG tube seen with its tip either in the stomach antrum or first portion of the duodenum.
Sternotomy wire is seen.
- MRI C-spine without contrast Impression: 1.
- CT guided drainage of right-sided perianastomotic fluid collection Impression: 1.
Successful placement of an 8-French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] pigtail catheter within the fluid collection.
Brief Hospital Course: 81 yo M with history of ESRD s/p renal transplant, recent hemicolectomy for stage 1 colon cancer presented with altered mental status.
Course complicated by septic shock, respiratory failure requiring intubation and subsequently trach, and bowel perforation.
Ventilation was discontinued, and patient was started on morphine gtt.
Requiring IVF boluses and pressor prior to arrival to the MICU.
Initial source was thought to be pneumonia based on clinical findings and imaging.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl initially to cover HCAP and aspiration pneumonia and fluconazole for possible infected fluid collection in the abdomen, as it was previously found to have yeast.
Azithromycin was also added to cover possible atypical pneumonia.
Colorectal surgery evaluated patient for possible infection of the fluid collection and sent a swab that was done around the fluid collection, and it was unable to be probed through.
The swab essentially had coag negative staph, likely result of colonization of skin flora.
The bronchoscopy and BAL was unrevealing except for possible CMV, but it was thought to be non-specific given his transplant status.
With multiple antimicrobials, otherwise negative microbiology data, and improving clinical status off pressors, infectious disease recommended narrowing antimicrobials to fluconazole only after completion of a week course of antibiotics for pneumonia.
Fluconazole was changed to micafungin for concern of rising alkaline phosphatase.
He was peri-septic again in the setting of bowel perforation (see below), requiring IVF boluses.
Antibiotics were again broadened to daptomycin, metronidazole, zosyn, and continued micafungin.
Discontinued antibiotics when patient was made comfort measures only.
This was discovered as part of the work up for his worsening leukocytosis after a period of improvement, abdominal tenderness, and worsening hemodynamics (AF with RVR, new borderline hypotension) requiring fluid boluses.
Therefore, a drain by IR was placed.
Patient was intubated given concern for tiring out and inability to maintain airway.
However, he was unable to be weaned off of the ventilator due to tachypnea/respiratory alkalosis and also ICU myopathy.
s/p trach placement.
Required prolonged period of sedation holiday.
Patient was on Digoxin and Metoprolol - discontinued when heart rates dropped to the 30s.
Patient received vitamin K during his initial stay.
Warfarin was held.
He was switched to heparin gtt for anticoagulation given underlying AF, history of DVT, and the frequent possibility of requiring procedures.
However, it was transitioned to heparin subcutaneously after discovery of the perianastomotic leak, requiring the possibility of surgical intervention.
Suggested by his inability to be weaned off ventilator and persistent weakness.
