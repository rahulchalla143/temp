Admission Date:  [**2164-6-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2164-6-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2090-2-27**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with a history of type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease (status post myocardial infarction), and cerebrovascular accident who originally presented on [**6-11**] from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with painless jaundice and a 55-pounds weight over the past year here for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
A paracentesis was performed on [**6-13**] which showed no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
On [**6-14**], a Quinton catheter was placed in the right femoral vein, and the patient underwent hemodialysis.
During the course of hemodialysis the patient became hypotensive in the 80s/40s, and was subsequently volume resuscitated with 2.2 liters of fluids.
The patient was originally saturating 96% on room air but then desaturated to 93% on 2 liters of oxygen and then 95% on 4 liters of oxygen.
Fresh frozen plasma was given prior to line placement as the patient's INR was 1.7.
Additionally, the patient was started on ampicillin, gentamicin, and Flagyl for presume cholangitis.
Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography performed on [**6-11**] revealed intraductal mass, stent placed.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen performed on [**6-11**] (although limited by the patient's claustrophobia), revealed massive ascites, left greater than right small bilateral pleural effusions, liver nodularity (consistent with cirrhosis), 3.6-cm X 4.8-cm mass with increased signal in segment 4A liver, spleen mildly enlarged, varices along the stomach (portal hypertension), gallbladder with no stones and no ductal dilatation.
HYPOTENSION ISSUES:  Hypotension was treated with pressors (Levophed).
The patient was weaned off Levophed with gentle fluid boluses.
PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient remained stable on 4 liters nasal cannula and was saturating well.
The patient's pulmonary status was monitored closely while receiving fluid boluses for blood pressure so as to prevent a flare of pulmonary edema.
Albuterol nebulizers were given for wheezing.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE/CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES: No aspirin was given at this time as the patient was coagulopathic with an increased INR.
No beta blocker were given during this time as the patient was hypotensive.
If these values were to increase significantly, could possibly replace stent with a more permanent stent via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography to relieve obstruction.
RENAL ISSUES:  Acute renal failure; question as to etiology - acute tubular necrosis; status post contrast for computed tomography versus hepatorenal syndrome.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was originally started on ampicillin, gentamicin, and Flagyl for presumed cholangitis causing a septic picture with increased white blood cells, hypotension, and hypothermia.
This antibiotic regimen was changed to vancomycin, ceftazidime, and Flagyl so as to provide more protection for the kidneys.
The patient was oozing from intravenous site.
Thus, the patient was given three days of subcutaneous vitamin K to correct for the increased INR.
The patient received two units of packed red blood cells while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit for a hematocrit of less than 30.
The patient also received one unit of fresh frozen plasma prior to internal jugular central vein line placement on [**6-14**].
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient received fluid boluses for a decreased blood pressure; yet remained saturating well on 4 liters nasal cannula oxygen and had no complaints of chest discomfort.
ACCESS ISSUES:  The patient has a right internal jugular central line which was placed on [**6-15**], and a right femoral Quinton catheter which was placed on [**6-14**], as well as two peripheral intravenous lines.
The patient and the patient's family expressed a wish to not be started on pressors if the patient's blood pressure were to fall.
The patient will most likely go home with antibiotics for presumed cholangitis and other comfort medications.
