At that time, the decision was made to pursue internal stenting via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography at a later date.
The patient's oxygen saturation dropped to less than 90%, and the patient was given intravenous Lasix.
Postoperatively, the patient was put on levofloxacin and metronidazole.
She was still on levofloxacin on transfer to [**Hospital1 69**], where she was meant to undergo an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
Status post two cycles of Navelbine, status post two cycles of Taxol and carboplatin (last cycle ended on [**2144-2-24**]).
Status post radiation therapy for brain metastases.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Outpatient medications included Percocet, Decadron, Ativan, Zofran, Duragesic patch.
Ascorbic acid 500 mg intramuscularly q.d.

The patient's Intensive Care Unit course was notable for decreased urine output which responded to intravenous boluses.
Previous cholecystectomy with a leak through the cystic stump was noted.
At that time, the patient underwent successful sphincterotomy with successful metal-covered Wallstent placed in the common bile duct.
The patient was maintained on intravenous antibiotics for approximately 24 hours post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
Thereafter, she was switched to levofloxacin and metronidazole.
Due to its exudative nature, and the patient's diagnosis, it was felt that the patient's pleural effusions would continue to recurrent despite any efforts at repeated thoracenteses.
The patient was given a contact number for Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 31343**] should she desire pleurodesis or other intervention in the future.
The patient's pain was well controlled on her intravenous patient-controlled analgesia.
This was subsequently switched to her outpatient regimen of analgesics.

In the meantime, the patient should have her platelets checked periodically while on subcutaneous heparin.
The patient was also to follow up with the surgeon who performed her cholecystectomy (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
