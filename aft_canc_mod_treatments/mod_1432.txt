He was discharged on prednisone and MMF.
We started him on solumedrol 30mg IV BID, cylosporine 50mg [**Hospital1 **], and continued him on his MMF and budesonide.
He required a switch from PO to IV cyclosporin because he was not registering a detectable level while on PO.
Hepatology was consulted in the setting of his acutely elevated bilirubin (peak 29.0 on [**11-23**]) without response to IV steroids, MMF, and CSA.
The continued elevation in bilirubin was thought to be in part caused by infection.
He had been on acyclovir, atovaquone, and micafungin ppx.
In light of his fever, he was started on cefepime and vancomycin.
Liver recommended a re-biopsy of the liver, which was scheduled, and ultimately postponed on the afternoon of [**11-30**] because he went into a-fib with RVR and was transferred to the unit.
He was started on lactulose, and his other possible psychoactive medications were held.
His infection was being treated with cefepime (which switched to meropenem on [**11-30**]) vancomycin and micafungin, which was changed to ambisome on [**12-1**].
He was started on cefepime and vancomycin, and was continued on treatment with micafungin.
He was transferred to the ICU for further management [**11-30**].
He was put on telemetry and found to be consistently between 140-160 BPMs.
5mg IV metoprolol x 3 was given with no effect.
He was transferred to the ICU for further management shortly thereafter.
However, the abnormal plasma cells on BAL were concerning.
#  Hypertension: He was initially continued on his home dose of amlodipine 5mg PO daily which was subsequently increased to 10mg.
#  Pain: Pain from his multiple myeloma was controlled on Oxycontin 30mg [**Hospital1 **] and oxydcodone for breakthrough pain, which was his home regimen.
He was tapered off of his oxycontin and was not requiring any pain medication as his pain level was zero.
He was given stool softeners for constipation.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course  Patient presented with atrial fibrillation with RVR not responsive to IV beta blockade.
He was initially given IV diltiazem followed by initiation of ditiazem drip and digoxin load.
Afib became rate controlled on this regimen with HR <100 consistently.
His cyclosporin was held during his [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course.
Lactulose was stopped and rifaximin was started.
He was continued on mycophenalate and steroids.
Despite continuation of broad spectrum antibiotics for his worsening bilateral mulitfocal pneumonia, he developed worsening hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated.
Bronchoscopy was completed which showed gram negative rods for which tobramycin (for double negative coverage) and ciprofloxacin (atypical coverage) were added to his vancomycin and meropenum.
He was also switched from micafungin to amphotericin for empiric fungal coverage.
He became pancytopenic and neutropenic after intubation and was started on neupogen and received several transfusions of platelets.
Despite this treatment he progressed into septic shock and required full doses of phenylephrine and levophed.
With worsening pressures, his family voiced that he would not have wanted to continue with aggressive treatment considering his grave prognosis.
He was terminally extubated the evening of [**2162-12-2**] and passed away 30 minutes later with cardiopulmonary collapse.
The family was called regarding grief counseling services (phone for counseling [**Telephone/Fax (1) 35567**]), and his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
