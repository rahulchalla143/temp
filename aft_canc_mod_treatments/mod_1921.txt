He was scheduled to have an outpatient right femur stabilization procedure to help his pain on [**6-7**] but the pain became too much to bear at home and he required admission for pain control.
At home he takes oxycontin 140mg TID and Dilaudid 8mg q3 PRN pain which has not been enough to maintain his comfort.
He had a recent admission for similar hip pain from [**Date range (1) 27916**] during which time his pain meds were titrated up.
He was clearly uncomfortable and given IV Dilaudid with minimal effect on his pain.
He was transferred without any further intervention to the floor for further pain management.
He underwent pancreatectomy, cholecystectomy and splenectomy on [**2136-6-26**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
-In [**11/2137**], he developed recurrent disease in segment VI of the liver, which was treated with radiofrequency ablation.
In [**7-/2138**], he underwent right hepatectomy pathology demonstrated almost completely necrotic 2.8 cm focus of metastatic adenocarcinoma.
-In [**6-/2139**], he developed recurrence disease at the resection site within the right lobe of the liver and underwent radiofrequency ablation again.
-In [**11/2139**], he developed upper back pain and was found to have large destructive metastatic disease at T5 causing compression of the spinal cord.
-In [**12/2139**], he underwent T5 vertebrectomy and posterior lateral arthrodesis T2 through T8 with local autograft and completed radiation therapy in [**1-/2140**] involving the T3 through T7 area.
-In [**2-/2140**], PORT was placed and he was started capecitabine and oxaliplatin on clinical protocol which was complicated by development of severe enteritis and colitis.
-In [**5-/2140**], he started gemcitabine and erlotinib and completed a total of eight cycles until new disease was demonstrated in the twelfth rib with increased FDG avidity of widespread osseous metastatic disease.
Monthly Zometa infusion was added to his regimen on [**2141-1-20**].
-He underwent radiation therapy of the right clavicle, right iliac bone and left hip, which was completed on [**2141-3-3**].
The patient has not received further Zometa in the setting of renal insufficiency.

Brief Hospital Course: This is a 54 year old male with pancreatic cancer diagnosed in [**2136**] s/p total pancreatectomy, CCY, splenectomy; solitary recurrence in liver in [**2137**] s/p RFA/hemihepatectomy; second liver recurrence in [**2139**] s/p RFA; T5 metastasis induced cord compression in [**2139**] s/p partial vertebrectomy and XRT; refractory to treatment with cycles gemcitabine, erlotinib, and capecitabine; presenting now with severe refractory right hip pain related to a right femur met.
He was scheduled to have an orthopedic procedure as an outpatient on [**6-7**] to help stabilize the femur with the goal of helping to improve his pain; however, his pain became too much to bear at home on his oral pain regimen and he required admission for IV pain control.
He was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 27916**] for pain control related to this same pain in his right leg/back which required Dilaudid PCA.
The ortho/oncology service was consulted and recommended right femur plain films which ruled out pathologic fracture.
He was started on a Dilaudid drip in the ICU and his delirium quickly resolved.
He was then transitioned from a Dilaudid drip back to Dilaudid PCA at 0.37mg q6min and then to 4-8mg of PO Dilaudid q3 hours PRN.
Lovenox 40 mg SC QD was started for DVT ppx starting [**6-9**] which was one day post-op.
He was continued on his home oxycontin 140mg TID and baclofen 5-10mg PRN spasms.
His home anagrelide for essential thrombocytosis was held during his hospitalization for pre- and post-op prevention of bleeding, but the surgery service recommended restarting it on day of discharge.
He will need to remain on anagerlide given his high risk for clot with essential thrombocytosis.
Pt was also on Lovenox for DVT ppx, which needs to be continued for 1 month post-op.
Pt's pain regimen was ultimately titrated up to Oxycontin 180mg TID plus Dilaudid 12-20mg q4h PRN which gave adequate control, ensuring that the pt does not require any IV Dilaudid.
Pt was also given bowel regimen.
He was continued on verapamil 240mg daily and hydralazine 25mg was administered q6 PRN for BP>180 as the patient had an allergy documented to labetalol.
Pt was also started on Lisinopril 10mg daily for better BP control.
No antibiotics were initiated.
Pt was on a regular diet, on Lovenox for DVT ppx.
