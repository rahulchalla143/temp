He endorsed [**Hospital1 **] aspirin for a recent URI.
Interventional pulmonology was consulted and the pt was taken for urgent rigid bronchoscopy on [**2126-4-30**].
A dual-lumen ET tube was placed to occlude blood from R lung from entering L lung, and the patient was transferred to the TSICU for further monitoring.
In the TSICU the pt is intubated and sedated on propofol and paralyzed with rocuronium.
Blood pressures had begun to drift down in the OR, and peripheral neosynephrine was at 1mcg/hr.
Physical Exam: Afebrile, BP's 110-120/60, P 50-60, RR 12, 100% on AC 500/12/5/100% General: Intubated and sedated HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, ET tube in place Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, ?
Modest inferior lead ST-T wave changes may be primary and are non-specific but baseline artifact makes assessment difficult.
Bronchial washings [**2126-4-30**]: (From RUL) Atypical epithelial cells, favor reactive bronchial cells.
Right precordial lead ST-T wave configuration may be primary and is non-specific but cannot exclude possible ischemia.
No evidence segmental/larger PE; limited for eval of small/subsegmental PE.
Spiculated 3.7 x 2.9 cm mass in the right upper lobe causing obliteration of the anterior segmental bronchus, with associated right hilar lymphadenopathy.
Double-lumen ETT in left main bronchus.
Trans cath embo therapy [**2126-5-1**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Embolization was performed by placing multiple Hilal coils in the intercostal artery beyond the origin of the right bronchial artery and then using 500-700 micron Embospheres to embolize the right bronchial artery with successful angiographic result.
However, MRI is more sensitive in detection of intracranial metastases.
# Hemoptysis: The patient was transferred to the trauma SICU post bronchoscopy with placement of double lumen ETT tube.
He underwent pulmonary angiogram with coil embolization of the right bronchial artery without further epidodes of significant hemoptysis.
The thoracic surgery service was consulted for possible urgent lobectomy but given stabalization in his clinical status this was deferred.
He is scheduled to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Thoracic Surgery for further evaluation and management of suspected lung cancer.
# Hypertension: His antihypertensives were initially held given concern for hemodynamic instability but were restarted as the patient's clinical status improved.
His home dose of amlodipine was increased to 10mg daily prior to discharge.
# BPH: Finasteride and flomax were continued     Medications on Admission: finasteride 5 mg daily flomax 0.4 mg daily amlodipine ?5 mg daily captopril ?dose TID omeprazole 20 mg QOD multivitamin daily calcium daily recent ASA - 2 tabs daily of unknown strength robitussin prn no other NSAIDs  Discharge Medications: 1.
