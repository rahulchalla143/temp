[**2201-1-1**] 9:15 AM Successful placement of right IJ triple-lumen VIP catheter which can be used for dialysis and IV access with tip at the cavoatrial junction.
The patient presents for conversion of a temporary hemodialysis catheter to a tunneled hemodialysis catheter.
Successful conversion of a temporary double-lumen VIP dialysis catheter to a tunneled 14.5 French, 19 cm tip-to-cuff dual-lumen dialysis catheter via the right internal jugular vein, with tip at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium.
FINDINGS: Again note is made of central venous catheter terminating at the junction of SVC and right atrium.
IMPRESSION: Central venous catheter terminating in the junction of SVC and right atrium.
Upon Discharge/Interval Data: WBC 6.9 Hb 11.6 Hct 31.6 Plts  92 Ca: 7.9 Mg: 1.7 P: 3.0   Brief Hospital Course: Dr. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 yo gentleman with critical aortic stenosis, chronic renal failure admitted with mental status changes in the setting of uremia and hypertensive emergency.
ED course: Patient received Lopressor IV 5mg x 4 and Hydralazine 10mg IV x 1 to control BP down to 130-150.
Neurology therefore recommended BP monitoring in ICU.
In the MICU: Patient was admitted to MICU with neurology consult recommendations to keep MAPS <130 with SBP <140, goal achieved with IV hydralazine which was then changed to Metoprolol IV.
Renal was consulted, patient was started on HD with HD catheter placed by IR, DDAVP was given for uremic coagulopathy, and bicarb drip started for acidosis.
Patient was started on Levofloxacin for concern of PNA on CXR.
Patient also required total of 4 units of pRBCs for anemia.
In addition, Cardiology was consulted for troponin leak, thought to be [**3-5**] to demand ischemia, treated with beta blocker, Statin.
Nutrition eval recommended Dobhoff tube feedings.
Patient received Dobhoff tube feedings for less than 48 hrs then started on regular diet with aspiration precautions which he tolerated very well.
Patient continued to have transiently elevated blood pressures prior to hemodialysis and therefore required ongoing dialysis for fluid management.
On [**2201-1-6**] patient had a permanent HD catheter placed.
Repeat CXR on [**2201-1-6**] showed partial resolution of PNA and therefore the patient was continued on Levofloxacin to complete a 10 days course.
The patient hyponatremia resolved promptly with normal saline IVF and he no longer requires ongoing IVF given good PO intake.
Patient oozing from line sites and ear (basal cell CA on right ear) likely secondary to uremic coagulopathy.
Patient was initially managed with pressure dressings and thrombin applied to the catheter site.
Patient also received a one time dose of DDAVP per renal recommendations which also assisted in diminishing his oozing.
Patient also noted to have an elevated PTT to a max of 150 thought to be potentially secondary to heparin given with hemodialysis.
Patient was not given any heparin products on the floor given his bleeding tendency.
Initially required IV Hydralazine, Lopressor IV and Labetalol gtt with poor control.
HD required for fluid management and BP control.
Blood pressure came under good control with HD and all antihypertensive medications where discontinued.
Patient is currently off ALL antihypertensive meds which should be avoided given his severe aortic stenosis.
Blood pressure should be managed with dialysis alone.
Patient with worsening renal failure over several months, now presenting with uremic symptoms, started on hemodialysis during this admission with improvement in blood pressure and Bun/Cr.
Mental status improved with ongoing HD, likely secondary to treatment of uremia.
Patient initially had a temporary HD catheter placed which was then changed for a permanent line.
He is discharged with a right subclavian tunnelled catheter for permanent HD.
His blood pressures have been controlled with HD since patient has tight aortic stenosis (as above).
Patient is to continue with permanent HD in rehab.
Neurosurgical evaluation did not feel that the patient required any operative intervention.
Neurology was consulted and recommended blood pressure control in an ICU setting.
Blood pressure was managed with HD as mentioned above.
Anion gap closed with hemodialysis and ultrafiltration x 2. .
Hct 22 on presentation requiring one unit of pRBCs initially.
Patient was started on Levaquin however, given that the patient was very ill on presentation and the underlying cause of his change in mental status was not clear.
Patient completed a 10 day course of Levaquin (started [**12-31**]).
Patient as maintained on telemetry throughout admission.
This has resolved with treatment of the underlying cause, primary with HD.
Patient responded well to IV NS with improvement to 137.
Patient was initially given a beta blocker and statin currently off all antihypertensive medications.
ASA was held in setting of bleeding which can be restarted as needed after evaluation by his PCP.
This was treated with pressure dressings and thrombin.
Patient required a Dobhoff feeding tube temporary and then advanced to regular diet after speech and swallow evaluation.
Venodynes, aspirin and heparin held given bleeding, PPI, bowel regimen.
