He was evaluated by urology and maintained on continuous bladder irrigation.

Given this history, he was treated with a 7 day course of ceftriaxone for empiric UTI coverage, though his urine culture was negative.

On discharge, he was restarted on his home lasix dose.
His creatinine improved to baseline after IVF repletion.
He was intermittently diuresed with lasix for volume overload.
