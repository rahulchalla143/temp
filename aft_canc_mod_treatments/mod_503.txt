Admission Date: [**2102-2-8**]        Discharge Date: [**2102-2-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2031-8-15**]        Sex:  M  Service:  [**Last Name (un) 7081**]   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70 year old male with Stage 2A esophageal cancer status post chemo and radiation treatment.
Also of note, this patient has myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] status post thymectomy and apheresis, transient ischemic attack in the past, silent myocardial infarction in [**2092**], hematuria and rosacea.
The patient is admitted at this time for planned laparoscopic and thoracoscopic esophagogastrectomy to be performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**].
Biopsy and esophagoscopy by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15908**] confirmed esophageal carcinoma.
Skin revealed minimal bilateral nasal rosacea, a well- healed mid sternal scar, minimal erythema on the back from radiation skin changes and a port site that was clean, dry and intact with no erythema and was nontender.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Thus, at this time, the patient was admitted for further treatment and evaluation at the [**Hospital1 1444**] in the form of a laparoscopic/thorascopic esophagogastrectomy and on [**2-8**], the patient was brought to the operating room after having been fully preoperatively evaluated where the patient underwent laparoscopic/thorascopic esophagogastrectomy performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was brought to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit after also having received 750 ml of albumin, 500 mcg of fentanyl and 7 mg of vecuronium.
He was extubated shortly after the operation on the afternoon of [**2102-2-8**] and was complaining of only peri-incisional pain and tenderness near the right posterior back incision.
On postoperative day 1, the patient required a bolus of 500 cc of Lactated Ringers for mean arterial pressure near 65 and an elevated lactate, responded well to this and the patient was continued on maintenance level IV fluids.
The patient was on a planned six doses of Kefzol and Flagyl during this time.
The patient was also seen by the Nutrition Service on postoperative day 1 and suggested jejunal tube feeds progressing from half to three-quarter strength.
The Neurology Service was consulted at once and suggested that the vital capacity and negative inspiratory force be checked every 2 hours and that the patient may need intubation and diuresis.
He did receive Lasix 10 mg IV times two overnight and was on a nonrebreather mask with an FIO2 of 100 percent.
His urine output was noted to briskly increase after both doses of Lasix with some improvement in symptoms and exam.
Trophic tube feeds were also started at this time.
His central venous line was also removed during this time.
On [**2102-2-10**], postoperative day 2, the patient received a bronchoscopy and there was noted to be multiple plugs of mucus in the lower lobes, right greater than left.
The patient required intubation as well on the second postoperative day due to increased oxygen requirement and fatigability.
The patient was pancultured at this time, was continued on fluids and vancomycin and Zosyn were started empirically.
On postoperative day 4, the patient was noted to have had episodes over the last 24 hours of hypotension, again requiring fluid boluses with fever to 102 degrees.
The patient at this time also had bilateral chest tubes with the left putting out copious drainage and the patient was also transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells at this time.
On postoperative day 5, the patient underwent a Cortrosyn stimulation test that was normal and then on Monday, [**2102-2-13**], a percutaneous tracheostomy was performed as the patient was appearing to require the vent for a significantly longer period of time at this point.
There were no complications to the procedure and the tracheostomy was placed carefully and safely.
Tube feeds were at goal at this point and the goal continued to be to wean the ventilator if possible.
The patient was started on physical therapy at this point and was consistently out of bed to the chair during this time.
On postoperative day 7, his right jugular venous line was changed for fevers and he was noted to be tolerating a pressure support wean fairly well and was down to pressures [**4-4**] and PEEP of 5 at 50 percent for 4 hours.
On [**2102-2-15**], the patient had received bronchoscopy again and the patient tolerated this well.
The patient received another transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells at this time for a hematocrit of 28.7.
His aspirin was restarted at this point and the patient was out of bed and continued to exercise with Physical Therapy.
Vancomycin and Zosyn were continued and the goal at this point was to establish a trach mask.
The patient had not had a bowel movement and a Fleet enema was instituted.
On postoperative day 10, a trial of trach mask was attempted that failed.
A chest tube was placed on the right and the hematocrit came back at 26.1 and 1 unit of packed red blood cells was given.
The patient then received bronchoscopy again on postoperative day 10, [**2102-2-18**].
The patient tolerated this procedure well and seemed to benefit from it.
He was receiving chest physical therapy also at this time.
On postoperative day 12, the patient was noted to be tachypneic with decreases in pressure support and attempted weans.
Also, of note, the patient's central line was removed for these fevers.
The patient received a bedside swallowing evaluation on [**2102-2-20**] and was noted to be doing well, but to be maintained NPO until an upper GI study ruled out free reflux or regurgitation of material into oropharynx in regards to maintaining a safety against aspiration.
The patient received a Passy-Muir valve also at this time and appropriate Passy-Muir precautions were observed.
On postoperative day 13, pressure support was noted to be at 10.
The barium swallow had been normal with normal gastric emptying the previous day and nystatin was started for an oral thrush that was observed on physical examination.
On postoperative day 14, the patient had another chest x-ray done after the removal of the right chest tube.
On postoperative day 14, later in the day, the patient suffered another right-sided pneumothorax requiring placement of a chest tube that was placed mid clavicularly in the second intercostal space.
The lung was noted to re-expand well on chest x-ray that followed the placement of this tube.
Diuresis was continued at this point with Lasix and Diamox.
All antibiotics were stopped at this time.
On postoperative day 16, the patient was started on cycled tube feeds, running from 5 p.m. to 9 a.m. and a rehabilitation screen at this point was in progress.
The patient received another bedside swallowing evaluation on [**2102-2-24**] that showed him to be a risk for aspiration of thin liquids and pureed solids.
The patient was recommended to remain NPO until a further study had been performed.
This chest tube was then again placed back on suction and the lung was noted to re-expand on chest x-ray that followed.
Tube feeds were resumed at this time.
Tube feeds were advanced to goal.
