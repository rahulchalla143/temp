Admission Date:  [**2138-9-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-10-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-11-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Oxycodone  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: thoracentesis (left and right) dialysis catheter (right IJ) CVVH dialysis chest tube (left) pigtail catheter right HD catheter removed [**10-15**] left subclavian removed [**10-15**] left IJ placed on [**10-15**] right IJ placed on [**10-27**] Picc line (left) Art line x 2 (right and left radials)   History of Present Illness: The pt is a 74-yo woman w/ hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and a recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer vs. lymphoma, who presented to the ED for evaluation today for acute renal failure.
She had an abdominal ultrasound done on the day prior to admission for evaluation for paracentesis, and labs drawn that day showed worsening renal function, so she was called to come in to the ED today for evaluation.
She was treated with IVF, calcium gluconate, insulin w/ dextrose, Kayexelate, and albuterol nebs.
She was also given levofloxacin x1 for ?
She is being admitted to the MICU for evaluation and treatment of her hyperkalemia and acute renal failure.
Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: Normocephalic, Endotracheal tube, NG tube  Cardiovascular: (S1: Normal), (S2: Normal)  Peripheral Vascular: (Right radial pulse: Not assessed), (Left radial pulse: Not assessed), (Right DP pulse: Not assessed), (Left DP pulse: Not assessed)  Respiratory / Chest: (Expansion: Symmetric), (Breath Sounds: Rhonchorous: throughout)  Abdominal: Rigid and distended  Extremities: Right: 4+, Left: 4+ lower.
Last 2-3 days prior to leaving the MICU for the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she tolerated several hours without pressors; however, she received albumin or blood during these periods.
Line infections: changed HD cath over the wire on [**9-23**] and art line was d/c??????ed.
Will monitor PICC line for signs of infection.
Consulted ID for evaluation of whether hypothyroidism could cause shock.
Endo also concerned because pt had one episode of paroxysmal a. fib on [**9-20**] and increased dose of synthroid may precipitate further episodes.
- Cardiogenic-  Originally, was concerned for tamponade.
Throughout her course in the MICU, have considered V/Q scan to r/o PE as a possible cause of hypotension however, given her echo findings, the pretest possibility remains equivocal.
- On [**9-22**], SVV (from Vigileo) suggested intravascular depletion, and repleted pt with crystalloid and colloid.
However, she did not require pressors for much of that day.
Prior to first thoracentesis, pt required BiPap but upon transfer, pt has been satting well on only 1.5L NC for several days.
Underwent both chest tube and pigtail placement for left sided effusion.
Chest tube was removed early in course of stay because it was extrathoracic and not draining but pigtail (placed by IP) continues to drain serosang fluid.
Has also used bronchodilators for wheezing.
On [**10-3**], chest tube fell out.
Pleural effusion should be responsive to chemo if tumor is.
However, if reaccumulates, will need pleurex catheter v pleurodesis.
Held on dialysis for a few days but CVVH was started on [**9-16**] but had to be stopped temporarily on [**9-20**] [**2-22**] poor access.
Urology will place a stent in the right ureter.
Na corrected slightly following initiation of insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemia.
Pt was placed on insulin sliding scale for the elev glucose.
Initially, pt was hyperphosphatemic but on the day of transfer pt required repletion of phos.
Used Na-Phos for added sodium benefit.
Have held home Lasix and ACE-I in setting of ARF.
# Metastatic ovarian cancer: cardiopulmonary status has been too tenuous for treatment during this admission.
Heme onc is following closely and feel that pt will require inpt palliative chemotherapy, most likely carboplatinum.
Also, on allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome.
Hyperkalemia, resolved: Was most likely due to worsening renal function, esp in setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I.
Treated w/ Ca gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment  and has remained wnl.
Hyperlipidemia - Taking home statin dose.
She responded well to albumin and IV fluids however the response was short-lived.
She was eventually weaned off pressors and started on corticosteroids which improved her pressure significantly.
However, during her ICU stay she began to deteriorate and her course was complicated by C. diff colitis tx with IV flagyl po/pr vancomycin.
Additionally, she developed a VAP w/ pseudomonas and was treated with ceftazidime.
The patient's [**Female First Name (un) **] fungemia was treated with caspofungin.
The patient was maintained and three pressors and remained intubated.
Maximal treat was administered, but the patients status continued to decline and she remained pressor dependent.
# Renal failure: Post stent placement by urology the patient's urine output did not improve significantly.
She was subsequently tried on HD, given albumin and fluids for volume, and eventually maintained a low but steady blood pressure with concominant tachycardia.
Cardiology consult felt this was consistent with NSVT, started patient on amiodarone IV overnight with good response.
#Pleural effusions: Patient had chest tube placement with initial high output which eventually tapered off.
Several days post admission to ICU the patient's chest tube fell out while moving from chair to bed.
IP was consulted but did not feel the tube needed to be replaced at that time and serial CXR were indicated to r/o PTX.
The patient's chest tubes were removed on [**10-24**].
The option of chemotherapy was discussed which the patient agreed to a trial of carboplatin.
Steroids and antiemetics were given as per oncology protocol during her chemotherapy.
She tolerated the course well and was maintained on HD throughout.
Tumor lysis labs were followed and allopurinol was started prophylactically.
