For exon 19, capillary gel electrophoresis is used to determine the size of the PCR product.
INTERPRETATION: These results indicate a missense substitution of arginine for leucine at codon 858 in EGFR exon 21 (L858R mutation).
These include missense substitutions at codon 719 in exon 18 (responsive) and at codon 861 (L861Q) in exon 21 (responsive), insertions in exon 20 (primary resistance), and T790M missense mutation in exon 20 (secondary resistance).
ACID FAST CULTURE (Pending):  Imaging: EGD [**2-9**]: Impression:	 - Blood in the stomach - Ulcer in the fundus (injection, thermal therapy) - Diverticulum in the fourth part of the duodenum - Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations:	 - Cannot exclude possibility of another lesion underneath clot.
- Keep NPO and continue IV PPI drip - Serial HCT - Check H. pylori serology  CT Chest ([**2-17**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Right IJ central catheter extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 YOM with h/o NSCLC, CAD on aspirin presenting with melena, nausea, vomiting with signs suggestive of UGIB.
Patient was started on PPI drip IV and anticoagulation was held.
The patient required 8 PRBC transfusions during hospitalization, the last on [**2-13**].
He was found to be H pylori negative, so no triple therapy was pursued.
Plavix and aspirin were restarted when bleeding was stabilized.
Beta blockers were also held during bleeding, and were not restarted on discharge due to continued low blood pressure (SBP 110s).
He was treated with vancomycin/cefepime for a presumed aspiration HCAP with a 7 day course from [**2116-2-10**].
This was treated with Tylenol and improved during his stay.
Terazosin was held due to low BP (SBP 110s), may be restarted as an outpatient.
Continue artificial tears.

secondary: coronary artery disease, s/p drug-eluting stent placement x2 NSCLC   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Given your recent cardiac stent placement, we worked with the Cardiology team to determine how to balance anti-coagulation with bleeding risk.
We made the following changes to your medications: - STOP codeine-guaifenesin cough syrup - STOP atenolol and terazosin due to low blood pressure; Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] may restart these medications as your blood pressure rises - STOP nitroglycerin - STOP prasugrel - START Plavix, a different blood thinner - CHANGE aspirin to 81mg daily - START pantoprazole twice a day to prevent gastric irritation - START [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] antibiotic, for a planned 7 day course - START erlotinib, a chemotherapy for your lung cancer - START loperamide (Immodium) for loose stools that can be a side effect of erlotinib  Please follow-up with your treating physicians as listed below.
