Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on [**2112-9-29**] for treatment of a cancerous head of pancreas mass.
On [**2112-9-29**], the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, double bypass consisting of choledochojejunostomy with a Roux-en-Y formation and gastroenterostomy, excision of stomach lesion, placement of gold fiducial seeds for CyberKnife radiation therapy, and open cholecystectomy, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO with an NG tube, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter and a JP drain in place, and an intra-thecal Morphine injection and either Morphine or Dialudid IV PRN for pain control.

Twenty-four hours after intra-thecal injection, the patient was started on a Dialudid PCA, which was subsequently converted to oral pain medication when he was tolerating clear liquids.
He pain control was consistent and adequate.
The NG tube was discontinued on POD#3, and the foley catheter discontinued the morning of POD#3.
