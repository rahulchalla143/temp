Aspirin, metoprolol and lisinorpil were held on admission.
IR angio embolization was deferred because of the negative RBC scan.
General surgery was also consulted, but felt emergent surgery was not indicated beause she remained hemodynamically stable.
She was sent home on metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] (compared to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] that she was on at admission), but lisinopril and aspirin were held.
Ultimately, it was suspected that her bleeding was secondary to diverticulosis, although the source was never definitely found on colonoscopy or tagged RBC scans.
A higher transfusion threshold was kept (at Hct 28) given the cardiac ischemia.
She was initially treated empirically with ciprofloxacin, but was changed to Bactrim when sensitives were returned and showed ciprofloxacin resistance.
(3) Aspirin and lisinopril were held and not restarted at discharge.
Her dose of metoprolol on discharge was also kept low at 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Titration of her BP meds and the decision to restart aspirin will be left to her PCP.
(4) Ms. [**Known lastname 5903**] needs a follow-up colonoscopy in one year with Dr.[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 172**] to remove sigmoid polyp (area was not biopsied at time of in-patient colonocopy given bleeding risk).

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a bleed from your GI tract which was likely from your diverticuli, although the exact source of the bleeding could not be found on the colonoscopy or tagged red blood cell scans.
You should follow the medication given to you on discharge.
Your aspirin was stopped because of your bleeding; you should ask your primary care doctor when this should be restarted.
One of your blood pressure medications (lisinopril) was also stopped because of the risk of low blood pressure with bleeding.
Your dose of metoprolol was decreased to 12.5 mg twice a day.
You will talk to your primary care doctor on [**6-12**] about restarting the lisinopril and increasing the metoprolol dose (she will check your blood pressure to see if the medications need to be increased).
You will also have home physical therapy for strengthening and balance exercises.
Please take your insulin at the same dose you were taking before you came into the hospital.
