The MRI was unchanged, and she has been followed with surveillance MRI by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] for surgery in [**Country 651**].
On [**2120-4-4**], she had an increase in the size of her tumor on routine MRI.
Repeat MRI done on [**2120-8-14**] showed  progression of the tumor as well again of her right cerebellar-pontine angle tumor on [**2120-9-18**].

On [**9-25**], the patient's repeat head CT showed increased ventricular size after drain was clamped.
Ventriculoperitoneal shunt placed without complication on [**9-26**].
Patient tolerated procedure well.
Neurologically unchanged after V-P shunt placement.
Repeat video swallow done revealed that the patient should remain NPO because of severe dysphagia and nonfunctional swallow mechanism.
Possible need for PEG tube discussed with family and patient, who refused initially.
Patient's steroids continued to be tapered on the 7th.
