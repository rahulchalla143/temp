HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 53-year-old female with past medical history significant for Stage III-B nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed in fall of [**2142**] with recurrent C, Factor VIII deficiency, and epilepsy, who presents with hemoptysis, and excessive secretions status post right main bronchus stent removal.
Originally patient was diagnosed with nonsmall cell lung cancer in fall of [**2142**], and was treated with XRT and chemotherapy with carboplatin and Taxol.
Her disease reoccurred in [**2143-5-5**], and she was again treated with XRT with minimal response.
On [**2145-5-3**], the patient underwent bronchoscopy (via cytology revealed nonsmall cell lung cancer) with stent placement in the bronchus intermedius.
She presents today for elective stent removal.
The procedure was complicated by 150 cc of hemoptysis poststent removal which was controlled with suctioning and airway protection.
Stage III-B (T4 M0 N0) nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed in fall of [**2142**] treated with carboplatin/Taxol induction with low dose XRT.
She also had a second XRT treatment in [**2143-5-5**] and had suffered some radiation pneumonitis.
Klonopin 0.25 mg po q4h, 0.5 mg po q hs.
Estrogen 0.3 mg po q day.
Progesterone 200 mg po q day.
Albuterol prn.
On [**2145-4-5**] chest CT scan status post stent showed stent in the right upper lobe bronchus marked with narrowing of origin in the right middle bronchus, moderate pericardial effusion, small partial loculated right pleural effusion, right middle lobe opacity, and diffuse emphysema.
Her secretions and cough were managed with Fentanyl and saline nebulizer treatments.
Her hematocrit remained stable and her hemoptysis decreased in frequency from seven episodes a day to just five episodes a day with sputum production consistent with a rust colored phlegm.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was aggressively attempted that the patient could not be revived.
In regards to her pulmonary effusion, it was thought that there was no need for a thoracentesis at this time.
She was initially treated with Vancomycin 1 gram [**Hospital1 **] and continued on Vancomycin given that she might develop sensitivities to other types of antibiotics and the fact that she was tolerating Vancomycin quite well.
