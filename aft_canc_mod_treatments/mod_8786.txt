Unclear if patient received benadryl and pepcid.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs [**Known lastname 107121**] was intubated for airway protection for angioedema/tongue swelling (as above) most likely secondary to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency.
She did receive 2 units FFP and diphenhydramine as well as minimal steroids.
Use of steroids was minimized given her history of steroid psychosis.
In addition, there is little evidence to support the use of diphenhydramine or steroids in the setting of acquired angioedema.
She was quite distressed by having to remain intubated for a second day and required sedation with fentanyl and midazolam.
Regarding her C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, as noted above, Mrs. [**Known lastname 107121**] had not been taking her danazol for the week prior to admission.
Her outpatient allergist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2603**], was involved with her care during this admission, and recommended that she be re-started on danazol at 200mg TID after she was extubated and tolerating PO's.
She was discharged on this regimen and scheduled for follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2603**] as an outpatient.
Regarding her CLL, her last treatment was [**7-15**].
She is on bactrim and acyclovir prophylaxis as an outpatient.
