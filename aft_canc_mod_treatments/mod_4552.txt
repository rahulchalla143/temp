She was treated with vancomycin, moxifloxacin, tamiflu.
She required high doses of propofol for sedation, and eventually became hypotensive, requiring pressor support.
Past Medical History: -hypertension -anxiety disorder -depression -PTSD -alcohol abuse s/p detox one month ago- during which she had a seizure  Social History: 1ppd smoker but no current alcohol or IVDA   Family History: father had CAD, also alcoholism  Physical Exam: Physical Exam on Arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Vitals: T100.2 axillary P107  BP121/61  R19  O2 sat92% on100%GENERAL:  patient is sedated, intubated, unresponsive HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  Pertinent Results: Imaging: [**2108-5-22**] - CXR: Supine positioning increases the cardiomediastinal caliber and causes pleural effusions to obscure large areas of lung.
ET tube tip with the chin down is less than 15 mm from the carina, approximately 2 cm below optimal placement.
Nasogastric tube ends in the upper stomach.
She initially required heavy sedation as well as paralytics to allow proper ventilation setting.
She was also started on very broad spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, levofloxacin, Flagyl (for aspiration), and Tamiflu (for possible viral etiology).
She was eventually narrowed to cefepime and finished 8-day course.
Esophageal balloon was used to allow better estimation of the need for her PEEP.
Ultimately, she was able to tolerate off paralytics and then extubated successfully.
She presented on norepinephrine support for hypotension.
A line was placed for better monitoring and then eventually removed.
She was weaned off norepinephrine and was able to maintain her BP with good urine output.
She was noted to have right eye ptosis and disconjugate gaze; MRI of the head was performed which did not show lesions to explain symptoms.
No other electrolyte or vital sign abnormalities were noted so we held off further workup and she improved.
Of note, after extubation, she had clear delirium and toxic metabolic encephalopathy from all medications used for sedation during her prolonged intubation.
When this normalizes or at least stabilizes she can be restarted on losartan, but while recovering from ATN she was placed on norvasc 5mg po daily in replacement of her home antihypertensive regimen.
We continued on home Buspar 10 mg daily and prozac 40 mg daily.
She was continued folic acid while in the hospital, this was discontinued at the time of discharge.
She should continue thiamine for an additional 1 month.
OT was consulted for cognitive evaluation and recommended outpatient occupational therapy.
She was ambulating well at the time of discharge and does not require physical therapy.
She also was treated with gabapentin and baclofen for chronic low back pain, tramadol was added given worsened back pain in the area of a decubitus ulcer.
