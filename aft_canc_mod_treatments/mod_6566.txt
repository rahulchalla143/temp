Her VS were stable at the time (BP 148/78) She reports 3 bloody BMs at her nursing home after being given lactulose 2 am, another 2 at [**Hospital3 4107**], and 1 in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Her coumadin was held from [**4-28**] - [**5-2**] for her supratherapeutic INR.
She was transferred to [**Hospital3 **], where she recieved 1 U PRBCs.
Patient was crossmatched for 4 [**Location 16678**] and PRBCs, and was given 10 mg IV vitamin K in the ED.
GI was consulted in the ED, who recommended INR reversal and NPO for possible colonoscopy tomorrow vs. tagged RBC scan.

Pt will need repeat colonoscopy in near future for removal of polyps.
Recieved 2U more prbc for active hematochezia and 2U FFP and Vitamin K for INR 2.5 at OSH.
Finally underwent colonoscopy on [**5-17**], EGD not done due to high risk procedure and low suspicion for UGIB.
Will reccommend it should be safe to resume prior dose of coumadin after 1week (so less risk for bleeding from rectal ulcer biopsy site).
She was total body volume overloaded [**1-23**] acute dCHF (hypoxia, UE/LE edema, wheezing) and got IV lasix X2 with neg 5L and creat remained stable.
She will be discharged on lasix 40mg daily and her creat should be followed.
Kept on lisinopril at higher dose.
Her Afib was not rate controlled and she was started on dilt which was titrated to 240mg (HR 80s).
Also her BP was not controlled and her lisinopril was increased to 10, dilt added as above, and lasix added as above.
Asthma was stable on claritin and inhalers.
INR reversed with ffp and vit K. -C-scope [**5-17**] with diverticulosis, rectal ulcer (would not have expected such a brisk bleed), and polyps (nonbleeding)-->still suspect was a diverticular bleed -needs f/u C-scope for removal of polyps in future -GI will contact with biopsy of rectal ulcer to r/o bleed -EGD not done because high risk, again, very low suspicion for UGIG, d/c IV PPI, place on oral -resume coumadin in 1 week -can resume ASA now .
Pt is total body volume overloaded and has effusions on CXR -no more fluids -s/p lasix 40mg IV [**5-15**] and 20mg IV on [**5-16**], creat 0.8--> so far pt about negative 5L -start on lasix 40mg QD-can titrate to [**Hospital1 **] as BP and creat tolerates -lisinopril-titrate dose .
clinically overloaded with edema, hypoxia -s/p lasix IV [**5-15**] and [**5-16**].
-start lasix 40mg daily--titrate as BP, creat tolerates -O2 sats good during day but needs O2 at night -dilt started and titrated to 240mg-->HR is now in 80s -unclear why not on BB, but possible due to recurrent asthma exacerbations.
-d/c foley .
no clear asthma flare, more likely fluid component as above -continue duonebs prn, advair, claritin 10mg daily .
Coumadin was held in setting of acute GI bleed.
-will resume coumadin in 1 week given they biopsied rectal ulcer yesterday--notify [**Hospital1 1501**] -dilt started and titrated to 240mg-->HR is now in 80s .
