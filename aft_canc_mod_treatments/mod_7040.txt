He received Q10 minute doses of valium for his withdrawal and his mental status did not improve, despite high & frequent dosing.
His delirium was later thought to be potentially due to benzo toxicity.
While intubated, he was treated with multiple sedatives when he appeared agitated.
He was extubated on [**3-25**] but continued to require occasional sedatives.
His delirium was likely exacerbated by pain, given his multiple spine surgeries, and he was treated with PRN IV narcotics.
He continued to be tachycardic and hypertensive for the majority of his time in the MICU, and he was started on a clonidine patch, in addition to his withdrawal medications.
Upon stabilization he was transfered to the medical floor where he continued to have improving delirium but still requiring occasional sedatives.
His delirium resolved on [**3-31**], he was able to tolerate a regular diet, and TPN was stopped.
# Urinary retention: Patient had a Foley catheter placed at the time of surgery.
This remained in place for ~2 weeks while the patient was intubated and during his prolonged delirium.
Once his MS was back to baseline the catheter was taken out but the patient was unable to void and was found to be retaining urine.
The catheter was then replaced and this was intented on 3 different occasions but the patient failed to void during all even after starting treatment with Flomax.
# Spinal Stenosis: The patient underwent anterior and posterior spinal surgeries.
His pain was treated as above during his MICU dose but these medication were changed to PO once his mental status was improved and patient able to take PO.
- Needs to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] 2 weeks after discharge  # VAP: The patient had fevers and CXR concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia, and he was started on vancomycin and cefepime on [**3-22**].
This was thought to be due to a combination of VAP, surgery and pain.

This subsequently resolved and patient was weaned off these medications.
