Admission Date:  [**2188-3-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2188-4-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2124-10-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8790**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left Brachial Plexus Radiation (2 sessions)   History of Present Illness: 63 YO F with metastatic adenocarcinoma, likely from a NSCLC primary, who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**3-29**] with her wife after experiencing increasing somnolence for two days and difficult breathing since the evening prior to admission.
On Wednesday, [**2188-3-26**], the pt was initiated on her first cycle of palliative chemotherapy with carboplatin-paclitaxel-bevacizumab.
The following day, [**2188-3-27**], she also received Zometa and Neulasta.
She was treated with IV Lasix and morphine.
She was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for ongoing medical managment and intensive nursing care.
Due to the patient's symptoms, she was started on palliative radiation without a diagnosis.
Unfortunately, shortly after completing the initial palliative radiation, the patient developed upper left extremity neurologic complaints that prompted initiation of palliative radiation therapy to the C6 to T5 spine.
The lack of ER/PR staining makes hormone therapy not an option.
PMH: *extensive skeletal metastises with resultant left upper and lower extremity weakness, pathologic fracture of right acetabulum, presumed spinal instability *s/p XRT to sacrum and pelvis, C6 and T5 *osteoporosis *prior premalignant oral lesions in both her buccal mucosa and the floor of the mouth, treated with topical ablations >10 years ago depression *GERD *allergic rhitis *prior laparotomy for lysis of adhesions after IUD associated pelvic inflammatory disease   Social History: Smoked 1.5 ppd x 21 years.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender and non-distended.
[**2188-3-30**] CXR: Again seen is enlargement of the mediastinum consistent with known left-sided mass; upper zone redistribution and vascular blurring, suggesting superimposed CHF; increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and elevated left hemidiaphragm; and patchy opacity at the right base.
Given limited testing ability, the patient was treated for hypervolemia with diuresis as well as aspiration/post-obstructive pneumonia given her depressed mental status and lung mass.
She responded well to nebs and lasix with a CXR c/w continued volume overload.
She was also given a total course of 10 days of levofloxacin and flagyl for possible aspiration or post-obstructive pneumonia.
Much of this cleared with treatment of her hypoxia, however, she remained somewhat altered with concern that she experienced permanent mental status changes during her several days of hypoxia or, alternatively, may have had a thromboembolic event or CNS spread of her malignancy.
Further diagnostic testing such as head CT, MRI and/or LP were not completed given HCP-wishes and significant improvement in mental status in the setting of a seemingly clearing delirium.
Given limited testing ability and with improvement in hypoxia, no Q1S3T3 on EKG, and patient having been on prophylactic lovenox as an outpatient, a decision was made to not empirically treat for PE.
Radiation oncology was consulted and the patient received one treatment to her left brachial plexus prior to discharge.
Her pain was controlled with up titration of fentanyl patch and prn morphine IR.

You were treated with lasix to remove the extra fluid and antibiotics to treat pneumonia.
You were also given nebulizer treatments which helped to open your airways.
You may continue to take lasix as needed at home if you, your family, or your hospice nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] in your legs or crackles on your lung exam.
You should continue to take flagyl and levofloxacin until your prescription runs out.
This will complete a 10 day course of antibiotics for pneumonia.
You should continue to do nebulizer treatments at home if you become short of breath or notice any wheezing.
It may have been related to the bone medication you received with chemotherapy or from leaky blood vessels from chemo causing lung congestion.
There are many other factors that may have also contributed which include pain medications and a possible aspiration event when your mental status declined.
You should continue this treatment for 3 more sessions per the radiation oncologists.
Your fentanyl patch was also increased from 75 to 100 mcg daily in an attempt to reduce your breakthrough pain needs.
You should otherwise continue your home medications as prior to this hospitalization.
