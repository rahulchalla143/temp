He was admitted to the ICU and started on vanc, cefepime, and cipro; he received flagyl as outpt which was not continued.
Vanc and cefepime were d/c'd, and ciprofloxacin was continued for a 4 day course in house (given its uncertain indication and course for him prior to hospitalization).
He received a speech and swallow evaluation that was largely unchanged from previous.
His aspiration diet was continued without changes.
He was also total body volume overloaded with 3+ pitting edema throughout.
He was on a minimal lasix regimen as an outpatient, apparently because he had little to no edema, but he was treated in the ICU with iv lasix, and this was continued as iv and po on transfer to the floor.
Although he is listed to have chronic renal insufficiency, his creatinine tolerated diuresis well with no elevation.
On discharge, he required no O2, but he should continue diuresis with daily weights and urine output monitoring .
Pt did have loose stools on arrival to floor and has been on antibiotics recently, though one of these antibiotics has been flagyl.
Likely in setting of fluid overload.
# Atrial Fibrillation: His rate was relatively well controlled after 1-2 days with iv metoprolol, transitioned to po metoprolol (he previously was not on metoprolol as outpt).
Pt's INR was 1.9 on day of discharge, but this was likely due to coumadin being held 2 days ago.
He will continue his coumadin and was recommended to have INR checked in 2 days.
S/p lovenox bridge to coumadin.
Memantine was not on formulary and was held while inpt.
