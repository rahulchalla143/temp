The patient was transferred to the floor and started on antibiotics for treatment of a possible aspiration pneumonia.
Of note:  The patient was still on a Prednisone taper from a recent admission at the time of arrival.
Traumatic brain injury in [**2190**] complicated by a seizure disorder status post right temporal lobe lobectomy.
Baseline pCO2 have been 65 to 75 in the past.
Last summer, the patient had a repeat swallowing evaluation during which he was able to tolerate soft solids and subsequently underwent removal of the trach and PEG an allowed to take POs primarily for quality of life issues.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction.
Chronic bradycardia and hypotension, baseline heart rate in the 50s and 60s, both of which have been attributed to a central process, status post brain injury.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o.q.d.
Lasix 20 mg p.o.q.d.
Levaquin 500 mg p.o.q.d.
Flagyl 500 mg p.o.
Singular 10 mg p.o.q.d.
Colace 100 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Haldol 2.5 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Alphagan ophthalmic drops to the left eye t.i.d.
Neurontin 300 mg t.i.d.
Lamictal 150 mg p.o.q.d.
Phenobarbital 60 mg p.o.q.d.
Prevacid 15 mg p.o.q.d.
Prednisone taper being weaned from the prior admission, currently at 20 mg p.o.q.d.
ALLERGIES:  Allergies include the following:  TAPE, ATIVAN, DILANTIN, OXACILLIN, TEGRETOL, SEAFOOD, CODEINE, AND MEROPENEM.
The patient was continued on steroids initially, IV hydrocortisone and ultimately PO prednisone, as well as bronchodilator therapy.
On [**2201-2-17**], the patient was intubated for airway protection.
We felt that he was unable to protect his airway with his heavy secretions given his depressed mental status.
ABGs pre-extubation and postextubation were not significantly changed in terms of oxygenation and ventilation.
From previous admissions, the patient was noted to have a baseline core-body temperature of approximately 93 to 94, which had been attributed to a central process, status post a traumatic brain injury.
The patient was ultimately given a trial of thyroxine IV given consideration that hypothyroidism might be contributing to his depressed mental status as well as to the other hemodynamic abnormalities, which were more chronic.
The patient did not improve substantially after the administration of IV thyroxine.
Ultimately, we attributed the patient's depressed mental status to a resolving pulmonary process, which may have tipped him over given his baseline brain dysfunction.
As per the neurology recommendations, we loaded him on phenobarbital and then continued his prior dosing.
He was treated with Ceftriaxone and Clindamycin initially.
The patient did develop a rash on his chest and upper arms later in his MICU course, which looked consistent with a drug rash.
We did push him from Clindamycin to Flagyl at that time out of consideration that the Clindamycin might be the culprit.
His rash subsequently resolved on its own, despite continued treatment with Ceftriaxone.
The Citrobacter species was initially read as being sensitive to Ceftriaxone and Ceftriaxone was, therefore, continued.
The Klebsiella was essentially resistant to everything except for Imipenem and Amikacin.
Given his overall clinical improvement at that time and the thought that the Klebsiella and the Citrobacter might be chronic colonizers more than anything else, no further antibiotics were added.
The patient will complete a 14-day course of Ceftriaxone and Clindamycin/Flagyl.
Lasix to maintain him at that goal-body weight.
Regarding the patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease he was maintained on bronchodilators and steroids.
He was initially given IV hydrocortisone thinking that he might have panhypopituitarism explaining his relative hypotension.
We ultimately transitioned him to PO Prednisone for better anti-inflammatory coverage of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
He should undergo a slow taper off the Prednisone and he was at 30 mg p.o.q.d.
He would likely not tolerated beta blockade given his chronic bradycardia.
The patient was noted to experience approximately six hours rate-controlled atrial fibrillation in the setting of IV Levoxyl therapy.
The Levoxyl was held for the remainder of the hospitalization.
free-water boluses and his sodium subsequently normalized.
We will plan to recheck the hematocrit and initiate a full anemia workup and consider transfusion given his coronary artery disease history.
Regarding the guaiac-positive stool, he should likely receive an outpatient colonoscopy.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient was maintained at a dry body weight of approximately 103 kg.
Lasix to keep him at that weight.
He was followed by the nutrition service and kept on tube feeds at goal.
We would recommend a repeat swallowing study and revisiting the issue of a chronic PEG tube with the family prior to discharge.
PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was maintained on Protonix and subcutaneous heparin.
ACCESS:  The patient had a right PIC line placed during this hospitalization for the administration of antibiotics.
