ALthough limited by lack of contrast, esophageal-gastric anastomosis appears intact.
Small amount of simple fluid just distal to the anastomosis of uncertain clinical significance.
Specifically, evaluation for upper abdominal lymphadenopathy is suboptimal.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 65 year old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and esophageal ca s/p surgerical intervention/chemo/radiation, admitted to the ICU with SOB, fever, orthopnea.
Patient was initially started on VANC/levo/flag then switched to Levo/flagyl to cover for aspiration pneumonia.
A thoracentesis was performed to alleviate some of his SOB/O2 requirement and assess for a malignant effusion.
A trial of prednisone was started for his SOB and appetite.
He did well and will continue a taper.
He was given morphine as needed for SOB.
Still prescribing meds for comfort.
Dobhoff tube was placed via IR due to anatomy of his espohagus.
Pt was started on tube feeds.
The dobhoff tube was pulled.
# Goals of care: as noted above, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] discussed likelyhood of recurrence of cancer given elevated CEA and continued loss of appetite and weight.
