Of note, the patient was treated with radiation and Taxol/Carboplatin from [**2149-10-1**] through [**2149-11-6**] with a seemingly good response.
Given the complex vascular supply of the tumor, however, the procedure was aborted.
On the night prior to transfer to the [**Hospital6 1760**], the patient had an additional 300 cc of hemoptysis with an associated drop in his systolic blood pressure to the 80s and was therefore started on a Dopamine drip.
Stage 3A nonsmall cell (squamous type) lung cancer diagnosed in [**2149-8-11**], status post Taxol/Carboplatin as above, status post radiation, status post bone scan [**2149-9-15**] (no metastases), pulmonary function tests with a FEV 1 of 1.0 (not a surgical candidate); 2.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Midazolam GTT titrated to sedation; Dopamine GTT at 10 mcg/hr; Metronidazole 500 mg intravenously q.
8 hours; Ceftriaxone 1 gm intravenously q. day; Ranitidine 50 mg intravenously q.
8 hours; Albuterol metered dose inhaler 10 puffs q.
1 hr prn; Epotropium 10 puffs q.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial physical examination the patient's temperature was 98.0??????
He was on a mechanical ventilator set at assist control 350/20/0.50/5, and arterial blood gases done on those settings was 7.34/38/82.
His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, and there were normoactive bowel sounds.
A 10 by 40 Ultraflex left lower lobe stent and a 12 by 40 Polyflex left main stem bronchus stent were placed with visualization into good position; the patient was reintubated bronchoscopically with the endotracheal tube at 25 cm following this procedure.
He was therefore started on Clindamycin 600 mg intravenously q.
8 hours for anaerobic coverage; this antibiotic was continued throughout his hospitalization.
He was also continued on the Ceftriaxone 1 gm intravenously q.
Airway obstruction - The patient had a significant airway obstruction from his tumor that was largely relieved by the tumor destruction and airway debridement during the initial bronchoscopy as noted above; in addition, two stents were placed in an attempt to maintain airway patency.
A post procedural chest x-ray demonstrated increased aeration of the left lung, and breathsounds were heard over the left anterior chest wall following this initial procedure.
He was successfully extubated on [**2149-11-18**], and remained on oxygen by nasal cannula ranging from 4 to 6 liters following his extubation.
He required minimal suction with the Yankauer catheter following his extubation; the patient was capable of clearing his own secretions with this catheter.
His oxygen saturation remained between 94 and 98% on 4 to 6 liters of nasal cannula following his extubation.
Hypotension - The patient reportedly became hypotensive on the morning of [**11-14**], after having a second episode of massive hemoptysis at the outside hospital and he subsequently required Dopamine to maintain his blood pressure.
He was transfused a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells at the outside hospital, and he did not have evidence of hypovolemia on admission to the [**Hospital6 1760**].
He was gradually weaned off of the Dopamine drip during his hospitalization and he required no further blood transfusions, as his hematocrit remained above 30 throughout this hospitalization.
Blood loss anemia - The patient had a drop in his hematocrit following his hemoptysis at the outside hospital; following transfusion of 4 units of packed red cells at the outside hospital, the patient's hematocrit improved to 32.5.
He was administered Vitamin K times one with resolution of his coagulopathy.
Both the patient and the family agreed that once the patient had been taken off of the Dopamine drip and once he was prepared for extubation, the patient would be made Do-Not-Resuscitate/Do-Not-Intubate.
Neither the patient nor the family wished for any further aggressive interventions in terms of his medical care.
Therefore, once the patient was successfully extubated on [**2149-11-18**], his code status was changed to Do-Not-Resuscitate, Do-Not-Intubate.
DISPOSITION:  At the time of discharge from the hospital the patient was aspirating all foods and liquids he attempted to consume, however, given that the decision had been made to transfer the patient to home hospice medical care, the patient was sent home only on medications as needed for pain as well as Scopolamine for minimization of oral secretions.
He was not sent home on any oral antibiotics given his inability to take p.o.
Status post bronchoscopy times two with placement of stent into the left lower lobe and left main stem bronchus  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.
72 hours prn for excessive oral secretions 2.
Fentanyl patch 25 mcg/hr q.
Sublingual Lorazepam 1 mg tablets to 2 mg tablets every 2 to 4 hours as needed for agitation 4.
