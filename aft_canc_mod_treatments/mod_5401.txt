Heterogeneous 6.3 x 2.5 cm fluid collection posterior to the right hepatectomy resection margin could represent post-surgical change and material such as Surgicel, although it is difficult to exclude abscess formation.

IV cipro and flagyl was started, an NGT and Foley were placed, and she was kept NPO with IVF.
A heterogeneous 6.3 x 2.5 cm fluid collection posterior to the right hepatectomy resection was noted.
Interventional pulmonology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and on [**Name (NI) 58274**] a right pleurex catheter was placed and attached to a pleuravac and suction.
She remained on O2 nasal cannula with diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes.
On [**4-13**], 700cc of serous fluid was removed from the pleurx tube.
The pleurx catheter was removed on [**4-14**] due to persistent leaking at the connection site to the pleuravac.
A right pleural 14 french pigtail catheter was placed at the 5th ICS.
This fluid was cultured and grew two species of E.coli resistent to ampicillin and cipro, but sensitive to Bactrim.
Therefore, Bactrim DS [**Hospital1 **] was started on [**4-11**].
The JP drainage averaged approximately 70cc/day.
Sphincterotomy was done with stent placement.
She had a second ERCP on [**5-7**] and she had a stent exchanged.
She will remain on Bactrim on discharge.
The JP drain remians in place.
She should be encouraged for frequent toileting and bladder training.
Given bile leak, infection and effusion repair was deferred at this time.
The plan was for her to go to rehab facility for further rehab, as she is requiring assistive devices and has increased O2 requirements with activity.
