Minimally-invasive esophagectomy with intrathoracic     anastomosis.
The patient underwent endoscopic mucosal resection on [**2107-5-12**] with pathology as low grade well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, at least intramucosal, multifocally extending to specimen margins with concern for invasion, possibly into the muscularis mucosae.
He presents to discuss the possibility of surgical resection.
Mr. [**Known lastname 19219**] explains that he had some mild heartburn in the past but has difficulty remembering exactly when he was first started on antacid medication.
He reports having been followed with serial endoscopy for at least 3-5 years for what sounds like Barrett's esophagus likely found at the time of his initial GI workup in the past.
Denies heart disease, MI, has never needed oxygen therapy, never been hospitalized, never taken inhalers or steroids for his lungs.

Old rib fractures on the right are again seen   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 19219**] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the Operating Room where he underwent a laparoscopic esophagectomy.
He tolerated the procedure well and returned to the PACU in stable condition.
His tube feedings were started via J tube on post op day #1 and he was eventually cycled over 18 hours.
He was able to use his incentive spirometer effectively and his oxygen was gradually weaned off with room air saturations of 94%.
His epidural was removed and he was treated with oxycodone for pain via the j tube.
A barium swallow was done on post op day #6 which confirmed no anastomotic leak and he began a liquid diet which he tolerated well.
Unfortunately his J tube site started to leak some purulent material and some erythema was noted around the tube.
The J tube was removed on [**2107-7-4**] and his diet was advanced to soft solids along with Ensure supplements which he continued to tolerate well.
He was also placed on Keflex and the wound was monitored for another 24 hours.
