Pt was referred to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 86316**],ENT, in [**11-1**] for a rt neck mass.
After multiple attempts to perform a fiberoptic intubation, pt underwent a tracheotomy for airway protection.
An FNA of the rt neck mass was also done and positive for poorly differentiated SCC.Post procedure he required pressors for a short time.
At the ICU pt monitored closely adn remained stable.pain manged with a morphine PCA.
He denies HAs, n/v, chest pain, sob, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria/frequency.All other ten point ROS is negative.
CAD s/p STEMI s/p stents x 3 to mid LAD [**4-1**] 2.
Hypercholesterolemia 3. s/p ankle surgery   Social History: Pt lives alone, works in food service at [**Hospital1 778**].
Neck: Supple,trach in place, rt cervical mass extending to supraclavicular region,left cervical enlarged lymph node measuring 3 cm palpated.
There is subcutaneous air in the lower neck and upper mediastinum probably related to placement of the tracheostomy tube.
This mass measures 6 cm AP  by 4 cm TV by 3 cm SI, though these measurements are approximate as the mass is difficult to measure given irregularity and lobulation.
A right retropharyngeal lymph node measuring 1.4 cm x 1.19 m is seen posterior to the mass.
Note: Immunohistochemical staining shows that the tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin cocktail, CK5/6, p63, and p16, and are negative for chromogranin, synaptophysin, NSE, and LCA.

Alt 24 Ast 21 AP  43 TB  0.2   Brief Hospital Course: 62 yo man with new diagnosis of SCC of the oropharynx Stage IVB s/p tracheotomy transferred from [**Hospital1 2025**] for further management.
Admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for initial management and subsequently transferred to the floor to start his chemotherapy with TPF which he tolerated well [docetaxel 75 mg/m2 day1 , cisplatin 100 mg/m2 day1, and continuous infusion 5FU 1000mg/m2 per day days [**11-26**]].
His course was complicated by upper airway infection with fever and purulent trach secretions and bleeding/skin breakdown around his trach site.
He had transient changes in mental status attributed to the high dose steroids that he received as premedication for the docetaxol in his chemo regimen which were treated with haldol and DC of steroids.
HE WILL REQUIRE NEULASTA INJECTION ON [**2166-8-23**].
Side effects of chemotherapy were reviewed with the patient and he was consented with chemotherapy.
Pt started on decadron 8 mg [**Hospital1 **] x4 days [**2166-8-15**] and DC'd for agitation [**2166-8-18**].
Protocol reviewed with pt, chemothrapy to include docetaxel day1 , cisplatin day1 and continuous 5fu infusion days [**11-26**].
Fitted with Passy-Muir valve [**2166-8-21**].
Treated with allopurinol because of large tumor burden.
Peg tube placed [**2166-8-11**].
-Will need neulasta support in AM of [**2166-8-23**] ~ 24 hours after chemo has completed late night [**2166-8-21**].
-Will need dental eval in preparation for xrt in the future-after completion of induction chemo.
#CAD: MI in [**3-/2165**] with stent placement.
Continued  metoprolol, aspirin and simvastatin.
Metoprolol at home was 100mg metoprolol succinate.
However, given hypotension at OSH and sinus bradycardia dose decreased to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **].
D/C'd plavix per cardiology recommendations since patient is more than a year from stent placement and requiring peg tube placement and chemotherapy in the near future as well as recent hemoptysis and continued evidence of blood in trach secretions.
Seen in consultation with cardiology and treated with decrease in metoprolol and transient DC of fentenyl patch used for his cancer pain and trach site pain.
Metoprolol decreased to 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Restarted fentanyl patch [**8-19**] since this does not seem to be the culprit med and no further bradycardia on telemetry.
# Hyperglycemia: transient, mild, likely due to steroid premedication for chemotherapy.
DC'd decadron and treated with Haldol QHS and prn.
#Pain:- Not as good control since restarting fentanyl patch and morphine per G tube.
Restarted fentenyl 75 mcg patch [**2166-8-19**] and increased to 112 mcg just prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 **].
Increased morphine to 30-60 mg per G tube Q2H prn pain just prior to transfer.
Had been on a morphine PCA with good control prior to starting fentenyl patch at basal rate of morphine at 2 mg /hr with 2 mg bolus doses Q10 minutes.
#Fever: Patient had fever, leukocytosis, and purulent trach secretions in the ICU.

Discharge Instructions: You were transferred from [**Hospital1 2025**] after undergoing urgent tracheostomy for bleeding from your tongue cancer that was causing you to have problems breathing.
[**Name2 (NI) **] were initially seen in the intensive care unit and then transferred to the floor where you got TPF chemotherapy for your cancer.
You tolerated your chemotherapy well and will need a neulasta shot when you get to [**Hospital6 **].
While you were in the hospital you had a slow heart rate that was treated with decreasing your metoprolol and stopping your fentenyl patch.
Your fentenyl patch was then restarted without further heart rate problems.
[**Name (NI) **] also had an upper airway infection that was treated with IV antibiotics.
You were treated with dexamethasone steroid medication during your chemotherapy which caused you to be confused.
Your confusion was treated with haldol and stopping the dexamethasone.
After discussion with the heart doctors, your plavix was stopped because you had some bleeding around your tracheostomy site and also needed your PEG tube placed for nutrition.
You will continue to take a low dose aspirin daily.
