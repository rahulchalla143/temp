She was noted to have coffee ground emesis through her OG tube, with guiac negative stools, and was given 40mg of IV pantoprazole.

Apparent thrombosis of the distal right subclavian vein around the CV catheter with extensive collateralization in the right chest.
The left ostiomeatal complex, and bilateral fronto-and spheno-ethmoidal recesses appear occluded.
Very poor dentition as described, with findings strongly suggestive of periapical abscess involving a left maxillary molar and, perhaps, right maxillary incisor with evident cortical breakthrough.
Opacified mastoids, bilaterally, with fluid in the right middle ear cavity, which may relate to the combination of prolonged intubation and supine positioning; however, an inflammatory component cannot be excluded.
This episode occured temporally after being restarted on Valsartan so angioedema was on the differential but given history of multiple recent intubations, laryngeal edema was thought to be the most likely etiology.
She was started on steroids on admission which were stopped after a brief course.
Decision was made for tracheostomy and PEG tube placement.
Family was in agreement with this plan and the patient tolerated the procedure well; she was able to be weaned to a trach collar over the following two days.
Patient was transferred to the floor and continued to do well from respiratory standpoint, satting 100% on the trach collar with supplemental oxygen.
Speech and swallow saw her in consult and she was fitted for a PM valve with good results.
- we recommend avoiding ARBs and ACEi in the future given possible contribution to resp issues - Will complete antibiotic course for ?
VAP was also on the differential but was thought to be unlikely given short duration of intubation.
She was empirically started on Vancomycin for a planned 8 day course.
Vancomycin was continued for an 8-day course (finished [**2173-9-27**]), and levo/flagyl were continued for a planned 10 day course (to be finished [**2173-10-2**]).
She was transiently started on a Labetolol gtt and then transitioned to an oral regimen of PO Labetolol and clonidine (hydralazine also used transiently).
Low dose amlodipine was added to her regimen as well.
Her blood pressure was well controlled on these agents throughout her hospital stay.
The pt has  prior history of gastritis resulting in an UGIB, however no further intervention was persued on this admission.
She was continued on HD on her regular schedule (Tu/Th/Sat).
The pt is known to have thrombosis around the distal portion of her HD line, for which renal has currently elected not to treat.
- discuss with outpt nephrologist regarding indication for anticoagulation for thrombosis.
6)Type II DM: She was continued on NPH at half dose while NPO as well as insulin sliding scale.
7)FEN: Patient was started on tube feeds after she was intubated.
Nurses noted high residuals so she was started on standing Reglan with mild improvement.
She then had a PEG tube placed and tolerated subsequent feeding well.
Speech and swallow saw her in consult and she passed a PO trial and was started on a diet of pureed solids and thin liquids in addition to tube feeds per S/S recommendations.
8) PPX: Patient was kept on bowel regimen, heparin SC.
10) Psych/neuro: Pt's home meds of celexa, namenda, and risperdal were not continued while in the ICU given use of other sedating meds.
Consider restarting namenda and celexa after d/w PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] does become slightly delirious on occasion at nights and even needed restraints at one point.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Laryngeal Edema causing acute respiratory failure Dental infection now s/p extraction Thrombosis of HD line - plan to hold on anticoagulation for now Hypertension: s/p new medication regimen Possible [**Last Name (un) **] and ACEi allergies  Secondary: ESRD on HD qTues, Thurs, Sat Type II Diabetes mellitus Vascular dementia s/p CVA Osteoarthritis   Discharge Condition: Stable, satting well on trach collar, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because of unresponsiveness and difficulty breathing.
We think this is likely due to a combination of swelling in your airway from previous times when you had a breathing tube as well as possible medication side effect of swelling from one of your diuretics.
In the hospital, we needed to put in a breathing tube so that your airway would function properly.
We did a surgery to insert a tube through your airway (tracheostomy tube) so that you would not need to be on the ventillator, and also placed a feeding tube so that you would get adequate nutrition.
Please take all medications as directed.
