Admission Date:  [**2126-11-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-12-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2053-10-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3376**] Chief Complaint: vertigo and imbalance  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Suboccipital decompression/craniotomy Colonic mass resection Diagnostic cardiac catheterization IVC filter placement  History of Present Illness: Per admitting resident: 73 year old R handed woman with PMH of HTN who p/w acute onset vertigo and nausea.
Her hospitalization has been complicated by Afib with RVR requiring IV metoprolol and PO metoprolol for rate control.
General surgery was consulted for possible surgical resection.
Currently, the patient denies any CP, dyspnea, abdominal pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.
Of note, patient reports she had not been taking any medications prior to admission.
The patient denied fever, wt loss, appetite changes, cp, palpitations, DOE, sob, cough, wheeze, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abd pain, fecal incont, dysuria, nocturia, urinary incontinence, muscle or joint pain, hot/cold intolerance, polyuria, polydipsia, easy bruising, depression, anxiety, stress, or psychotic sx.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the mid to distal anterior septum, and the distal anterior wall, apex, and distal inferior wall.
Status post suboccipital craniectomy and decompression, with right transfrontal placement of EVD with tip at the third ventricular floor, and short-interval improvement in hydrocephalus.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management on [**11-25**].
She was admitted to Neuro ICU and treated per stroke protocol.
She was started on heparin gtt for likely artery to artery embolism, however, she was noted to deteriorate with R VF loss, inability bisect the line and dysmetria.
She was noted to have progression of edema and infarcts on repeat CT and thus heparin was discontinued.
She was started on ASA, and statin given LDL of 201 and NSTEMI (see below).
HOB was maintained at 30 degrees, ISS and tylenol were used for euglycemia and normothermia.
BP was maintained at goal with IV hydralazine to 120-140 mm Hg SBP.
ECHO did not show a source of a thrombus, but did show extensive hypokinesis in the  mid to distal anterior septum, the distal anterior wall, apex, and distal inferior wall without an overt evidence of an embolism.
She was taked to OR for suboccipital decompression on [**2126-11-27**] and EVD placement.
Given this, she started heparin on [**12-2**], however, as noted below heparin was eventually stopped secondary to bleeding complications.
Pain was typical for unstable angina (SOB, diaphoresis, pressure like) and resolved upon receiving morphine at OSH.
Due to progressing cerebellar infracts, heparin gtt was stopped.
She was started on ASA 81mg, Statin and BB with goal of HR to 60-70s.
This was felt to be due to either central/CVA induced demand or an NSTEMI in setting of prior stenosis.
She was treated on BB with good effect (amiodarone was intermittently used which resulted in hypotension).
For risk stratification after her troponin leak,  she underwent cardiac catheterization which showed 20% mid-LAD stenosis and 80% D2 stenosis.
She had an episode of flash pulmonary edema which resolved w/ Lasix/BB/Hydralazine treatment.
Because of hematochezia (see below) she was not anticoagulated and instead an IVC filter was placed on [**2126-12-3**].
Her O2 sats were stable at 95-99% on 2L NC prior to transfer to the surgery service on [**2126-12-6**].
GI consultants felt that the likely cause was C.Diff (given ABx exposure); she was started on PO Vancomycin.
She was transferred to the surgery service on [**12-6**] for resection of her colonic [**Hospital 83631**] Surgery course: Operative course uncomplicated.
Pain controlled with IV pain medication.
IV fluid discontinued.
Medications switched to oral, including antihypertensive regimen (conversion to PO medication discussed with Cardiology, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 640**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]).
Pain well controlled with oral oxycodone and Tylenol.
Coumadin dose titrated according to INR.
Lovenox discontinued.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 7749**] should eventually have her hytertension and antocoagulation managed per her PCP.
Medications on Admission: prilosec 20mg daily  Discharge Medications: 1.
Acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for pain: Do not exceed 4000mg in 24hrs.
Metoprolol Succinate 50 mg Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr PO DAILY (Daily).
Aspirin 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily): Decrease to 81mg daily once INR therapeutic.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain for 2 weeks.
Omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)
Simvastatin 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Coumadin 1 mg Tablet Sig: titrate dose per INR Tablet PO once a day: Goal INR [**2-12**].
Status post posterior fossa decompression 3.
Status post colonic mass resection 7.
Status post IVC filter placement .
For this, you required a surgical decompression.
You tolerated the surgery well.
You were started on coumadin (a blood thinner), which you will need to continue for at least three months.
Your primary care doctor will manage your coumadin dosing and INR level (a measure of how thin your blood is).
NEW MEDICATIONS/MEDICATION CHANGES: -aspirin (decrease to 81mg daily once INR therapeutic) -coumadin (titrate dose according to daily INR, goal= [**2-12**]) -toprol xl (extended release metoprolol) -simvastatin .
*Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while taking pain medications.
* Please resume all regular home medications and take any new meds as ordered.
-You may shower, and wash surgical incisions.
