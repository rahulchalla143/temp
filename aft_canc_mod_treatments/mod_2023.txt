From a respiratory standpoint the patient was extubated on the following day but required re-intubation after three days secondary to increasing secretions and need for pulmonary toilet.
Sputum culture from [**12-18**] subsequently grew MRSA and the patient was treated with a 10 day course of Vancomycin for presumptive MRSA pneumonia.
The patient was finally extubated on [**1-5**] after aggressive diuresis.
Per the surgery service, the collection was thought to be draining into the rectal stump and no further surgical management was indicated.
Blood culture from [**12-18**] subsequently grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**] and the patient completed a 14 day course of Fluconazole on [**1-5**].
There was also concern about coronary artery disease.
The patient reportedly had a cardiac catheterization at an outside hospital with a 30% LAD and 50% RCA occlusions.
She had been treated with Amiodarone and Lopressor with good effects.
The decision was made to not anticoagulate her given her recent surgery and the risk for bleeding.
From a nutrition standpoint the patient was initially on TPN after her surgery but this was discontinued after the [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**] fungemia was found.
The patient has since been on tube feeds via NG tube and is at her goal.
She has been tried on Celexa and Ritalin without benefit and is currently on Wellbutrin.

From an infectious disease standpoint, the patient completed a 10 day course of Vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia and MSSA sepsis as well as a 14 day course of Fluconazole for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**] fungemia.
Given her complicated history and tenuous condition, we opted to treat her with a single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] Ciprofloxacin for two weeks.
They felt that since the abdominal collection was draining into the rectal stump, no further surgical management was indicated.
She had a GJ tube placed on [**2121-1-5**] for further tube feedings.
She tolerated this procedure well.
We treated her with Amiodarone and Lopressor.
Only opted to continue the Amiodarone load as well as continue her on the oral Lopressor for rate control.
She was aggressively diuresed with Lasix in the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient did well off the Lasix with a decreasing bicarbonate level.
She was continued on Lopressor and was started on enteric coated Aspirin 81 mg q day.
She had been started on Wellbutrin per the psychiatry service.
The patient was continued on her ProMod with fiber tube feeds at a goal rate of 60 cc per hour.
After a discussion with the family, we opted to have a PEG tube placed for ease of medication and tube feed administration, however, we recommend that the swallowing study be repeated in approximately one week.
We had physical therapy and occupational therapy consult and both agreed that the patient would benefit greatly from inpatient rehabilitation.
