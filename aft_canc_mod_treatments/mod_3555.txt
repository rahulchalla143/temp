Course complicated by Portal Vein Thrombosis, Cholelithiasis with likely choledocholithiasis, transudative pulmonary effusion s/p tap, concern for DIC physiology (though thought unlikely given lab derrangements in context of cirrhosis), as well as hypercalcemia.
The stone as removed and a filter was placed, but bilirubin remained high (50s).
Of note, CT Abd reveals 8MM stone noted in CBD and ductual dilitation, but no improvement s/p ERCP with stent placement on [**11-30**].
Finally, labs further described below concerning for DIC (though subsequent factor assays--Factro VIII at 172 and ten and 7 93 and 16, respectively, suggest otherwise).
Lacutlose and Rifaximin given good results with these medication on last admission with same presentation.
