ENT was consulted for SOB, and found normal vocal cords, normal posterior pharynx, no lesions on vocal cords, +mediastinal lymph nodes.

BETA STREPTOCOCCI, NOT GROUP A.
CXR upon discharge: Tracheostomy tube and G-tube seen in relatively stable position.
There is improved aeration of the left lung with persistent atelectasis and consolidation with air bronchograms noted.
IMPRESSION: Improved aeration in the left lung with persistent atelectasis and consolidation   Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo former smoker admitted for workup of L lung mass after presenting w/ c/o dysphagia, hemoptysis, and weight loss x 2 months, admitted to the ICU for acute SOB.
Sputum cultures did not, however, yield growth in order to guide antibiotic coverage.
He was continued on zosyn and vancomycin x14 days then switched to meropenem for 1 week to treat possible ESBLs.
On [**2-16**] he did very well on a trach collar and remained off the vent for >24 consecutive hours.
We recommend continued lasix 40mg PO daily for approx 1-2 weeks as he was quite volume overloaded during this admission.
Given his poor respiratory status and extensive disease burden, the heme/onc service did not feel that he would benefit from surgical resection or high dose chemo.
We did however treat him for a 5 day course of chemoradiation to help decrease the size of the mass in an attempt to assist with weaning off the vent.
.. # Left pneumothorax: Patient had a PTX s/p CT guided biopsy.
He had a chest tube placed on the left.
It remained in place for approx one week.
He did undergo VATS with pleurodesis on [**2-8**] given his signifant pleural effusion.
- lopressor 37.5 tid achieved good rate control .
-continue lopressor 37.5 tid, -lorazepam 0.5 prn .
This appeared to be combination of sedation for intubation and hypovolemia.
However, for at least 10 days prior to discharge, his blood pressure was well controlled on metoprolol 37.5 tid.
# FEN: A peg was placed on [**2-8**].
Tube feeds were started.
He tolerated these well.
# Anxiety: ambien and/or ativan prn .
