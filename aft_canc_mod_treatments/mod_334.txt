Cardiovascular:  The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and was admitted and placed on telemetry and monitored with serial CKs and troponin.
The patient actually did rule in for inferior myocardial infarction and was started on Plavix as the patient is unable to take aspirin and given her coagulopathy was not started on heparin, also with the possibility of there being some kind of mass lesion in her brain the patient was not given any heparin.
The Plavix was discontinued secondary to hematemesis with coffee ground emesis and the patient was not placed on any anticoagulation after this point or antiplatelet agents as she was at significant risk for further gastrointestinal bleeding.
She was started on a beta blocker as well as an ace inhibitor and nitrates, which she will continue as an outpatient.
After much discussion it was decided that if no further surgical workup was to be planned and no further chemotherapy would be planned the patient was to continue on Tamoxifen and would be offered radiation therapy with the understanding that this may not be a tumor, however, the benefits of palliating her symptoms would out weigh her chances of getting morbidity from the radiation itself.
The patient would like to continue her radiation treatment at [**Hospital3 2358**] where she had it in the past.
The patient went to the Intensive Care Unit for a day to monitor her for further bleeding, however, her hematocrit and hemodynamics were stable and she was not transfused and not endoscoped as she had just suffered an myocardial infarction.
