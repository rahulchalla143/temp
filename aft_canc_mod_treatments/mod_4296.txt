History of Present Illness: This is an 80 year old male with a history of BPH, urethral stricture, HTN, valvular heart disease, who presents with one to two months of vague abdominal discomofor and the slow onset of jaundice over the last 3 weeks.
The patient went to an OSH for elective ERCP on [**2177-3-11**] at which time a ulcerating mass was identified at the ampulla which could not be passed by scope and the procedure was abandoned.

Status post interval Whipple procedure, with mild thickening of the proximal Roux limb, likely post-surgical.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2177-3-24**] the non-specific ST-T wave changes noted in precordial leads V2-V6 are less prominent and the rate has decreased from 140 to 123.

WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2177-4-1**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
[**2177-3-30**] MRSA SCREEN-FINAL: Negative.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient was transfered from an Outside Hopsital and admitted to the General Surgical Service on [**2177-3-12**] for further evaluation and treatment of a newly discovered ulcerating ampullary mass on ERCP at the OSH.
He was made NPO, and he was started on IV fluids and empiric IV Unasyn.
Given his history of BPH and urethral stricture, Urology was consulted to place a foley catheter.
A 6-French external biliary drain was placed with the pigtail loop in the dilated common bile duct; unable to place an internal biliary drain due to the obstruction.
On [**2177-3-19**], the patient underwent open cholecystectomy, pylorus-preserving Whipple resection, jejunostomy tube placement, and reduction of left inguinal hernia, which went well without complication (see Operative Note).
He was NPO with an NG tube, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter, J-tube to gravity, JP drain to bulb suction, and capped PTC in place, and he received a dose of intra-thecal Morphine for pain with good effect.
On POD#2, the patient was transferred to the inpatient floor, but was returned to the SICU that same day for an episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR and hypotension, which did not respond to Metoprolol IV alone.
Converted to NSR on an Amiodarone drip.
Neuro: Once the intra-thecal Morphine timed out, the patient received Dilaudid IV PRN for post-operative pain with good effect and adequate pain control.
By discharge, the patient only required Acetaminophen PRN for disconfort with good effect.
He wears hearing aides at baseline for hearing deficit.
Changed to Amiodarone drip and continued on Metoprolol IV for rate control with good effect and conversion back to NSR.
At discharge, atrial fibrillation and HTN were controlled on Amiodarone 400mg PO BID.
GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV fluids.
The NG Tube was initially discontinued on POD#3, but replaced on POD#5 and POD#8 due to recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting.
Trophic tubefeeds via the J-Tube was started on POD#6.
The Nutritionist placed post-discharge tubefeed recommendations in the discharge paperwork for management at rehabilitation.
The JP drain to bulb suction remained in place; a culture sent on [**2177-3-31**] grew moderate [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans; treatment of this was deferred.
The JP drain and J-Tube remained.
The foley catheter, placed by Urology due to his history of BPH and urethral stricture, remained in place at discharge.
Of note, at home the patient self-catheterizes beyond the urethral stricture with a urethral stent to urinate.
He was started on Ciprofloaxacin on [**2177-3-30**] for a pan-sensitive E. coli UTI for a total of 7 days.
Wound care: Middle apsect of the subcostal transverse incision was opened, and saline wet-to-dry dressings started on POD#11.
He will continued to receive wound care at the rehabiliation facility.
Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout his stay; sliding scale insulin was administered as indicated.
He did not require exogenous insulin at discharge.
Prophylaxis: The patient was started on a Heparin drip on POD#5 given the atrial fibrillation.
Once the afib was controlled on the oral Amiodarone, a risk analysis was performed, and it was determined to discontinue the Heparin drip on POD#8, and start the patient on Aspirin 325mg PO daily plus the Amiodarone.
When not on a Heparin drip, the patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay; Physical Therapy was consulted to get the patient up and ambulating as early as possible.
The patient was tolerating clears for comfort and continuous tubefeeds via the J-tube, ambulating with 2 person assist, voiding via foley catheter, the JP to bulb suction, and pain was well controlled.
