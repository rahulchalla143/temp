She    was admitted for Antastan and Cytoxan with the course    complicated by neutropenia.
She subsequently    went to [**State 108**] for the winter and was recently admitted    [**5-10**], for a cycle of CEPP with Cytoxan, Etoposide,    Prednisone for presumably large B cell lymphoma    transformation.

Pulmonary/infectious disease - The patient had febrile    neutropenia initially treated with Vancomycin, [**Month/Day/Year 18517**] and    AmBisome, as well as Flagyl.
She developed some diffuse    erythema of unclear etiology and her [**Name (NI) 18517**] was changed to    Levofloxacin and AmBisome was changed to Voriconazole    although a clear allergy had not been documented.
At that time, the patient was switched to    Vancomycin, Meropenem and Voriconazole as there did not    seem to be added benefit of Levofloxacin or Flagyl with    this regimen.
She continued to have an increasing oxygen    requirement and at times required a nonrebreather.
She    had been getting nebulizers and steroid treatments because    of a possible history of chronic obstructive pulmonary    disease and chronic outpatient steroid use.
Code Status - It was explained to the patient that as her    white blood cell counts increased and that we now    beginning to treat this pan-resistant Klebsiella that her    pulmonary status may decline in the short term until this    pneumonia resolves.
Pain control - The patient had been on outpatient    OxyContin and her dose was lowered because of her tenuous    respiratory status.
She was initially placed on Ativan and was given Ativan    prior to procedures.
Bladder spasms - The patient was continued on Detrol as    she was taking as an outpatient.
