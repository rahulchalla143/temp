Mild pelviectasis on the right,and more prominent pelvocaliectasis on the left, with additional multiple parapelvic cysts bilaterally.
The patient was treated with oxygen, lasix, nitro, morphine in the ED with little result.
On arrival to the floor, the patient was breathing comfortably on 4 L supplemental O2 which was successfully weaned on the day prior to admission.
After initial diuresis, the patient was thought to be euvolemic and diuresis was stopped prior to transfer to the floor.
In house, the patient was treated with metoprolol, aspirin, nitrates/hydralzine.
It is recommended that the patient begin an ACE inhibitor when renal function returns to baseline.
On HOD#5, the patient had bilateral ureteral stent replacement and the creatinine subsequently continued to normalize to a level of 1.5 on day of discharge.
The patient will follow-up with urology for outpatient management and likely restenting in a few months.
A left femoral vein DVT was found on MRI on HOD #4.
At this time, the patient was begun on heparin for anticoagulation.
Given the patient's history of GI bleed on coumadin, the decision was made not to initiate coumadin for outpatient anticoagulation.
Instead, an IVC filter was placed with the assumption that the long-term complications of clot may not be as significant in this patient with a somewhat limited life expectancy.
