She was intubated with etomidate and succinylcholine, and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management of likely aspiration event.
She was anuric on arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], and did not put out significant urine to 500mL NS bolus.
She was given albumin 12.5gm and an additional 500mL NS bolus, with little effect.
Her BP also fell to SBP 80, with little response to 2L NS wide open.
A subclavian central line was placed, and neosynephrine and, eventually vasopressin, were required to keep her MAP>65.
Due to suspicion of hepatorenal syndrome, octreotide and albumin 25gm [**Hospital1 **] were started.
It was explained that to continue aggressive treatment would entail further invasive procedures, such as additional paracenteses, continued endotracheal intubation, and a likely very prolonged ICU course.
She was started on a morphine drip, and all unecessary medications and tests d/c'ed.
