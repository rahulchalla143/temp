Admission Date:  [**2127-9-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-11-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2088-5-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: Fever and Abominal Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cholecystectomy, G-Tube Placement and Removal, J-Tube Placement and Removal, Bone Marrow Biopsies.
OSH Course ([**Hospital3 417**]): RLL pneumonia per CXR - Levaquin commenced.
URINE TOX SCREEN: + benzos and opiates, - PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 57131**], amphetamine, marijuana, barbiturate, tricyclic  ECG REPORT: 'NSR, nonspecific ST/T wave changes.'
One population, identified within the "blast gate," comprising 80% of gated (17% of total) bone marrow cells expresses immature antigens CD34, HLA-DR, myeloid associated antigens CD33, 13, 11c, and 117, a small subset CD64 and CD71, and lack CD4, 14, and 56.
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
A bioprosthetic ttricuspid valve is present.
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
A bioprosthetic tricuspid valve is present with mildly thickened, but mobile leaflets.
2) Status post J-tube removal.
3) Stable appearance of subhepatic gas-containing fluid collection.
Low density focus in the left internal capsule that is of uncertain etiology.
AML: On routine labs at the outside hospital, the patient was noted to have an elevated WBC (>60) with blasts (50% of the WBC).
Upon stabilization she was started on the (7+3) chemotherapeutic regimen for her AML.
She was prophylaxed with acyclovir (she developed an HSV lesion on her upper lip during her course), vancomycin, along with the empiric fungal (caspofunging or ambisome) and gram negative (which included imipenem, amikacin, cefipime and levofloxacin at different times in her course).
An initial plan for percutaneous placement of a cholecystostomy tube for stabilization was pursued, but due to imaging findings revealing the unlikliehood of successful drainage of her gallbladder contents, surgical cholecystostomy and intrahepatic biliary stenting was pursued.
Jejunal and Gastric tubes were placed intraoperatively [which were removed late in her course after clinical improvement and improving PO intake.]
Post-operatively, the patient had excessive amounts of bilious drainage from her surgical wound.
After unsuccessful attempts, the procedure/sphincterotomy was complicated by a large gastrointestinal bleed and the patient required monitoring and blood/volume resucitation in the ICU.
A repeat ERCP was pursued and epinephrine injection and biliary stenting resulted in tamponade of the bleeding site and successful diversion of biliary drainage.
Her cholecystectomy was also complicated by post-operative hemoperitoneum requiring repeat laporatomy.
Fortunately, after continuous empiric antimicrobial coverage along with bone marrow recovery from chemotherapy (rising ANC), her clinical picture improved dramatically late in her course.
On discharge, her nausea and vomiting had resolved and her abdominal pain was controlled with low-dose narcotics.
She was discharged with surgical follow-up for biliary stent removal.
She was empirically covered on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin (given her history of MRSA) as noted above.
There was a concern for an infectious (toxic-metabolic encephalopathy) or possibily malignant etiology.
Early in her course, her HCV viral load was two million.
Anti-HCV therapy was not instituted.
Her native aortic and mitral valves were surgically replaced with porince prosthetics.
Of note, her infective endocarditis was complicated by stroke.
