Initial ABG in ED was likely falsely hypoxic as obtained at parallel time with intubation and repeat gas 90min later with no sig change in vent settings much improved an no longer with PaO2/FiO2 consistent with ARDS.
Patient received 1 dose of levofloxacin in the ED.
She was intubated in the ED and was extubated the next morning after she was net negative 2.5 L with diuresis with iv lasix.
