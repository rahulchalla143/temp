Admission Date:  [**2112-6-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-7-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-8-18**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Penicillins / Cephalosporins / Ciprofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 17813**] Chief Complaint: hypothermia, increased seizures  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 42 yo W with h/o with a refractory seizure disorder (on 3 AEDs and w/[**Known lastname 15741**]; followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 16883**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 85740**]) following resective and radiation therapy for [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 111222**] in infancy, multiple meningiomas, MR/ID and pan-hypopituitarism with chronic hypothermia, obesity with OSA (no CPAP) presents with hypothermia and increased seizure frequency.
She was treated for PNA, and given stress dose steroids.
Her baseline seizure frequency until recently had been around five to six per month.
[**6-9**]- 8pm, eyes rolling, face stiff/distorted, head and bilateral extremities shaking, body stiffened, face red, screaming, 40 sec [**6-15**]- 2:25pm, similar to [**6-9**], 1 min 20 sec [**6-18**]- 6:30pm, eyes rolling, generalized stiffening/shaking, 15 sec with 30 sec postictal  The patient presents today because caretakers noted her to be hypotherma to 92-[**Age over 90 **] F. She had not had any infectious symptoms such as cough, SOB, rhiorrhea, congestion, sore throat, foul smelling urine, N/V/D.
She had been taking prophylactic med (methanamine) to prevent UTI for about 1 month, ending [**6-11**].
ROS: per parents No headache, change in speech or comprehension, dysphagia, new focal weakness, fevers, sweats, cough, SOB, N/V/D, abdominal pain, rash.
Right parietal [**Month/Day (3) 111222**]- age 1.5 yrs, s/p resection and radiation (so baseline left hemiparesis), complicated by hydrocephalus s/p VP shunt 2.)
Refractory seizures on multiple AEDs, s/p [**Month/Day (3) 15741**];  about 5 times per month with a variety of manifestations (turns red in the face; brief movements of her eyes, brief moments of non-responsiveness).
Panhypopituitarism (hypogonadism, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism); on glucocorticoid and thyroid replacement, progesterone) 5.)
s/p Mohs surgery for a recurrent nodular basal cell cancer on the left occiput; also s/p BCC Tx with Aldara.
h/o VPS in RLV, reportedly removed in [**2091**] (but seen on current and prior head imaging, with dilated ventricle) 11.)
s/p cholecystectomy in [**2099**]   Social History: Patient lives in a group home (Open [**Doctor Last Name 7730**]).
Brief Hospital Course: 42 yo F with hx of refractory seizure disorder (on 3 AEDs and w/[**Month/Year (2) 15741**]; followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 16883**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 85740**]) following resective and radiation therapy for [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 111222**] in infancy, multiple meningiomas, MR/ID and pan-hypopituitarism with chronic hypothermia, obesity with OSA (no CPAP) who presents with hypothermia and increased seizure frequency.
Etiology of hypothermia - likely hypothalamic, prophylactic steroids unlikely to help.
A Bair Hugger was placed and she was slowly rewarmed.
Continuous video EEG recording captured 2 seizures with brief behavioral arrest, electrographically associated with electrodecrement then fast activity.
She is unlikely to attain better seizure control with adjustments to her AED regimen, and there will be a balance between side effects/drowsiness and seizure control, so no changes in her seizure medications were made during this hospitalization.
*ENDOCRINE: Endocrine was consulted and her Hydrocortisone was increased to 25 [**Hospital1 **] for the first two days of hospitalization, however this was generally empiric to cover her for potential infection or increased seizures and not meant to specifically improve her temperature stability.
She was returned to her home dosing of hydrocortisone 15/5.
She was continued on the rest of her home endocrine regiment: levothyroxine 112mcg daily, progestin 100mg.
It was determined that her variable temps should be treated empirically with NSAIDs unless there were other clinical signs of infection.
A screening WBC, UA and CXR would be reasonable if there was any other clinical concern for infection (O2 demand while awake, change in HR or RR, etc),  *PULMONARY: O2 sats were monitored and she was given supplemental O2 as needed (hx of OSA not on CPAP).
There were a few nights when her O2 sat would dip into the low 90s, high 80s and she was placed on nasal cannula.
She had previously been living at a group home, however it was decided by the parents that she was not receiving adequate supervision while there.
- Please treat low or high temperatures with ibuprofen 600 mg q6 hours.
consideration should be given for a screening CBC, CXR and UA.
If these are normal, her temperature fluctuations should be treated with regular NSAIDs.
Please note that the patient can become more somnolent or have slightly increased seizure frequency with abnormal temperatures and this alone may not be indicative of an infection.
