PENDING RESULTS Pericardial Fluid Cytology Pending Abdominal Fluid Cytology Pending Final Culture data from Blood, Urine, Pericardial Fluid and Abdominal Fluid not all finalized  Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE This is a 77 year old gentleman with complex medical issues, including recent hospitalization for medically managed cholecystitis, presenting with chest pain, found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and admitted to Medicine.
Patient was transferred to the CCU for monitoring after pericardiocentesis (no tamponade physiology on echo, procedure performed for diagnostic purposes), who subsequently developed fever and hypotension requiring pressure support with phenylephrine.
He ultimately opted for re-focus of medical management to pain management and positioning therapy and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility.
ACTIVE ISSUES # GOALS OF CARE: After significant discussion with both his family and his medical providers the patient voiced his desire for re-focus of his medical management to control of his pain, and focus on comfort.
The patient stated he understood that termination of dialysis would not be compatible with life.
Since the patient had been having transient episodes of hypotension during HD sessions, and in order to better clarify the etiology of the pericardial fluid, a pericardiocentesis was performed.
Two hours post-procedure the patient became hypotensive, initially responding to fluid boluses, then requiring Neo for pressure support.
He was pan-cultured and started on broad antibiotics- vancomycin, cefepime and metronidazole.
He then became febrile, and received more volume resuscitation for likely septic shock.
Studies were consistent with an exudative effusion and culture grew vancomycin resistant enterococcus.
Broad spectrum antibiotics were discontinued and daptomycin was started.
The source remained unclear, given nothing on imaging to support contiguous spread, and highly unlikely that the procedure introduced the organism.
Repeat imaging showed the effusion was resolved and the pericardial drain was removed.
He was treated with a 5 day course of Daptomycin before antibiotics were discontinued on discharge following the wishes of the patient.
He also had a recent history of transient hypotension during hemodialysis for which he was started on midodrine.
Post-pericardiocentesis the patient was treated with fluid resuscitation and broad antibiotics for presumed septic shock.
Given his history of recent medically-managed cholecystitis, and known intra-abdominal fluid collections, a CT torso was obtained to investigate potential sources of infection.
His HD catheter was removed.
Surgery was consulted to investigate possible cholecystitis (details below), and IR performed a drainage of an intraabdominal fluid collection, a hematoma.
His hypotension resolved, and he was weaned off phenylephrine prior to discharge.
His midodrine was increased to 5 TID.
Medical management was discontinued as the patient declined further medical management.
On admission he was initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, which were then narrowed to Levaquin.
Given our clinical concern for sepsis, a RUQ ultrasound was obtained and demonstrated a sludge-filled gallbladder and a small, unchanged fluid collection.
HIDA scan was positive and a percutaneous drain was attempted; however, the procedure was complicated by collapse of the gallbladder (inconsistent with acute cholecystitis) and development of a small hematoma.
A drain was placed in the abdominal fluid collection, which appeared to be an old hematoma.
The drain was removed.
# ESRD on HD: The patient normally receives HD on T/Th/Sat.
Given concern for sepsis, the tunneled dialysis catheter was removed and replaced with a temporary catheter.
Once stable, the patient received CVVH with phenylephrine for pressure support.
A permanent catheter was not placed as the patient declined further dialysis.
The patient has [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] S2 score of 3; however, given his history of intraabdominal hematomas, we elected to continue aspirin 325 for anticoagulation.
Medical management was discontinued as the patient declined further medical management.
We continued his aspirin and statin.
Medical management was discontinued as the patient declined further medical management.
He required a transfusion of 1 unit of pRBCs with appropriate response.
# PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY: Continued on gabapentin 100 qhs.
Medical management was discontinued as the patient declined further medical management.
# GASTROPARESIS: Continued on metoclopramide 5 mg PO QIDACHS.
Medical management was discontinued as the patient declined further medical management.

After a discussion with you, your providers and your family you decided you did not want any further medical treatment and wanted to transition care to management of your pain and positional discomfort.
We have reconciled your medications to be more concurrent with your goals of care.
We changed your medications as noted in the discharge summary.
