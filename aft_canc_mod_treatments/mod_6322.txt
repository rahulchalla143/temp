Seen here by ortho, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**], with planned repair and ?IVC prior to surgery "murmur" "mild CHF"   Social History: Pt lived in FL, now moved to [**Hospital1 **] Home for the Aged, an [**Hospital3 **] facility.
At discharge:: 97.8 / (129/61)  /  84  /  97% on room air -I/VI holosystolic murmur -lungs clear bilaterally, poor effort, distant -abdomen obese, soft, nontender -scar on right hip with staples, minimal erythema, overlying sheets stained with yellow serous fluid -legs are obese and symmetrically large.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 yo F with hx of CHF, dementia and hip fx s/p ORIF on Coumadin presented with asymptomatic anemia and supratherpeutic INR, found to have 6 cm fungating mass in sigmoid colon on colonoscopy.
Pt underwent substantial surgery of the right hip (description attached).
Surgical and medical oncology agreed that the pt must recover functional status (ie be able to walk) in order to be a candidate for surgical resection of her colonic mass and subsequent chemotherapy.
Coumadin was discontinued and the pt was stater on lovenox (prophylactic dose) prior to discharge.
Pt was also found to be iron deficient and she was started on supplemental iron.
General surgery and oncology were consulted.
Per oncology, pt is unable to receive chemotherapy until she can walk.
Given pt's recent DVT and high risk for thrombosis given malignancy, she was started on lovenox at prophylactic dose (30 subQ [**Hospital1 **]).
# Hip repair: Surgical intervention is outlined in "major surgical procedures" section.
Overling sheets become damp with serous discharge--this is expected to the current degree.
# Hx of "mild CHF": pt was on Lasix at home, but this was held on admission due to GI bleed.
She received 20 IV Lasix and O2 sats improved.
Given good response to Lasix IV, would dose on a prn basis for low 02 saturation and dyspnea.
