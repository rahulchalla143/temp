Atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right middle lobe.
Resting hemodynamics revealed hemodynamic evidence of pericardial tamponade, with equalization of the end-diastolic pressure contours.
After removal of 500 mL of dark sanguinous fluid, pericardial  pressures decreased to < 5 mmHg, although right heart pressures remained elevated with PCWP of 18mmHg, RVEDP of 14mmHg, and RA pressure of 16mmHg, with a prominant 'Y' descent and square root sign, consistent with residual effusive-constrictive picture.
Atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right middle lobe.
Pericardial drain in place.
During the examination interval two chest tubes have been placed in the left hemithorax pleural space.
One of these tubes meanders in cranial direction and terminates in a loop shape in the upper lateral pleural space overlying the anterior third rib frontal view.
IMPRESSION: Two chest tubes in place, small 1.5 cm apical pneumothorax is present.
Tamponade supported by findings of electrical alternans on EKG.
Unable to measure accurate pulsus paradoxus due to frequent coughing, however most likely elevated.
Differential for pericardial effusion is broad including viral pericarditis, HIV, autoimmune, hypothyroidism however based on patient's prior history of breast cancer and recent weight loss is very concerning for metastatic malignancy.
Patient went to the cath lab and had a pericardial drain placed.
Patient treated with indomethacin for her chest pain, as well as opiates and anxiolytics as needed.
Once the drainage from the pericardial drain diminished, surgery created a pericardial window during a L VATS procedure.
Thoracentesis done in the CCU to drain the right pleural effusion ([**9-16**]), with cytology & laboratory studies sent.
During surgery's pericardial window creation procedure, the left pleural effusion was also drained and a talc pleuradesis was performed.
Patient's last appointment [**2115-1-30**] reports she is to continue Aromasin (aromotase inhibitor) which she is currently not taking and is over due for mammagram.
Once patient's hypotension resolved (s/p drainage of pericardial fluid), patient restarted on home lisinopril.
Patient treated with albuterol NEBs, ipratropium NEBs, continued outpatient singulair.
