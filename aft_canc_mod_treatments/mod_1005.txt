His 6[**Hospital **] hospital stay included a brief ICU stay for respiratory distress while receiving idarubicin for 7+3 induction, and then his post-chemo course was complicated by C. [**Hospital 563**] candidemia.
He was initially started on Micafungin for the candidemia, however LFTs were noted to rise with a new abdominal pain.
Although it was felt unlikely that micafungin caused the LFT elevation, it was switched to anidlofungin per ID recs and was discharged home with 2 more weeks of anidlofungin.
Diabetes Mellitus; followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3636**] at [**Hospital **] Clinic; was started on insulin during last admission in Efb [**2194**] however it was stopped on [**2194-5-13**] per patient request (did not like the [**Last Name (un) **] of checking FS and giving injections) 3.

MICU course:  On [**6-6**] he spiked a temperature to 102.8F overnight, with SVT to the 140's responsive to diltiazem, and cefepime was started given functional neutropenia.
Given concern for leukostasis, preparations for initiation of pheresis were made.
Pheresis line was placed and leukoreduction therapy undertaken.
Hydroxeaurea and hydration were contineud to protect against tumor lysis.
He was afebrile but was given levaquin + vancomycin + zosyn for recent fevers and functional neutropenia.
Pt underwent pheresis without incident and was transferred to the floor.
He was continued on Decitabine chemo per protocol (total 5 days) and high dose hydroxyurea.
He was on allopurinol to reduce risk of hyperuricemia.
It responded well on Dilt IV (5 mg very slowly as BP would transiently drop).
Pt was maintained on Dilt 30 mg PO QID with holding parameters.
Lasix IV bolus was effective in managing his respiratory distress.
Pt was deemed to require insulin however pt refused it at home due to the rigors of checking blood sugars and giving appropriate doses of insulin.
Thus he was on glyburide instead at home.
# Past hepatitis B exposure: HBV surface antigen negative, HBV surface antibody positive, HBV core antibody (IGM) positive - Pt was started on Lamivudine for concern of HBV reactivation during prior admission.
