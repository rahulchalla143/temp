Admission Date:  [**2102-4-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2102-4-25**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86 year-old woman with a history of CLL, breast cancer and gallstones status post cholecystectomy who comes in with right upper quadrant pain, nausea and vomiting.
She reported that one week ago she had suprapubic tube replaced, which she has chronically for a history of post obstructive bladder obstruction.
The patient noted that the tube replacement was painful and this was unusual for her.
Her urine became dark colored and the tube was replaced again.
She had pain in the axilla and back, which was now improved after the tube had been changed.
The patient was transferred from [**Hospital3 4527**] for concern of cholangitis and started on Amp, Levo and Flagyl with blood cultures drawn prior to antibiotics initiation.
MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION: Coumadin 1 mg q.d.
The patient had 1+ pitting edema bilaterally with chronic venostasis and lower extremity skin changes.
LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count was 40.8 consistent with her history of CLL, hematocrit 30.4, platelets 152, INR 2.3, PTT 30.1, potassium 3.7, bicarb 24, creatinine 1.7, total bilirubin 9.8, direct bilirubin 8.2, alkaline phosphatase 309, ALT 170, AST 117.
Her urinalysis was positive with protein greater then 300, 50 to 100 white blood cells, 5 to 10 red blood cells.
The patient's obstruction was removed and a stent was placed in the common bile duct to facilitate drainage.
No acute source of bleeding was found and the patient was transfused 2 units of blood and her hematocrit responded appropriately and was stable throughout her hospitalization.
All heparin products were withheld and the patient's thrombocytopenia was resolved.
The patient was briefly put on neutropenic precautions, but then was taken off after hematology/oncology decided that this was a chronic neutropenia and the patient did not require neutropenic precautions unless she were to spike another fever.
The patient's antibiotic regimen was tailored to the Klebsiella that grew out of her blood and was tapered down to Levaquin alone, which was to be continued for a ten day course after discharge.
The patient received 400 mg once and then 200 mg po q other day for a three week course to be completed after discharge.
The patient's Coumadin dose was decreased to 0.5 mg per day to account for the fact that she was both on Levaquin and now Fluconazole, which could increase her INR.
The patient was arranged to be followed up with her primary care physician on [**2102-5-1**] at which time an INR could be rechecked as the patient is on multiple new medications that could increase her INR.
The patient was discharged to home despite a physical therapy evaluation that recommended rehabilitation as she had become deconditioned during her hospitalization and was having difficulty getting around and getting up.
Levaquin 250 mg po q day times seven days to complete a ten day course after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
Lopressor 12.5 mg po b.i.d.
times two weeks status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
The patient had a brief run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and will therefore receive beta blockade for two weeks postoperatively.
Docusate 100 mg po b.i.d.
Protonix 40 mg po q.d.
Coumadin 0.5 mg po q.d.
Fluconazole 200 mg po q other day times 21 days.
