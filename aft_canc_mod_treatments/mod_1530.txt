Admission Date:  [**2172-10-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-10-30**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vancomycin / Oxycodone / Lorazepam  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**] Chief Complaint: Failure to decanulate  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: T-tube and Y-stent placement - [**10-19**] T-tube and Y-stent removal - [**10-26**] Trach tube placement - [**10-26**] Bronchoscopy Trach change to Portex # 7 after patient pulled out trach balloon during agitation   History of Present Illness: This is an 88 year old male with history of COPD and CHF presenting for failure to decanulate tracheostomy tube at rehab with need for T-tube placement, with anatomy such that the distal end of the T-tube will be telescoped into the Y stent.
Two months ago he was also admitted to [**Hospital1 **] with respiratory failure and had a tracheostomy placed at that time.
At baseline, he is on a 50% trach mask with sats around 95%.
He is now being admitted for changeover of tracheostomy to a T-tube with placement of its distal end into a Y stent.
The procedure was accomplished this morning and he is doing well on the floor.

Tracheostomy tube remains in place and the midline sternal wires are intact.
On [**2172-10-20**] he had worsening of his secretions and was started on vancomycin and levofloxacin.
Bronchial washings came back with Staph aureus coag+, E. Coli, and stenotrophomonas  He is known to be a colonizer with MRSA and Stenotrophomonas.
His respiratory status progressively worsened on [**2172-10-22**] and his antibiotics were broadened to Vanc/Cefepime/Levo.
ICU Course 11-26-12/2: 88 year old male with tracheal stenosis, tracheobronchomalacia s/p placement of Montogmery T-tube on [**10-19**] and revision on [**10-20**] admitted to MICU with increased secretions and hypoxia with coughing following procedure ([**2172-10-26**]) s/p Y-stent and T-TUBE removal, mucous plugging s/p bronchoscopy and Portex trach tube re-insertion ([**9-29**]) after patient agitated and pulled out balloon.
# Tracheobronchomalacia with respiratory distress On [**10-26**], the patient underwent removal of his T-tube and Y-stent given minimal symptom improvement and hoarseness, and a [**Last Name (un) 295**] # 7 trach was placed.
Following the procedure, the patient had an episode of respiratory distress, and he was placed on pressure support ventilation.
He was ultimately weaned off pressure support ventilation, and placed on a TM, which he tolerated well.
Subsequently that evening, he became extremely agitated despite zyprexa and haldol thought to be sundowning and pulled out the balloon from his trach tube.
This was replaced overnight with a brief period of sedation with precedex.
There appears to be minimal options for further treatment as he is not a stent candidate given he failed trials and likely not an operative candidate.
In the ICU, CPAP settings of 10 with FiO2 of 50 %  He was continued on xopenox and acetylcysteine nebs and will need continued attention for secretion management.
Patient's antibiotics were broadened from cefepime to meropenem for E. coli EBSL and vancomycin was switched to linezolid for history of vancomycin associated ototoxicity.
Levofloxacin was discontinued.
*He is to continue on meropenem and linezolid until [**2172-11-1**]*.
This was attributed to effect of medication, and specifically his benzodiazepenes, codeine, and guiafenisen along with scolpamine patch were stopped.
He has a PARADOXICAL reaction to ativan causing agitation, so ativan should be avoided.
He will continue on olanzapine, avoid delirium-inducing drugs.
He was responsive to haldol during agitation episodes.
There were no active signs or symptoms of bleeding except some bloody secretions after a procedure early in the hospital course.
He was continued on amiodarone and metoprolol for his rate control.
# Hypertension: treated as above  # Hyperlipidemia: He was continued on atorvastatin at a decreased dosage of 40 mg given concern of high dose statin with amiodarone.
# Coronary Artery Disease: s/p CABG [**2156**]( LIMA->LAD, SVG-diagonal,  SVG-OM, SVG-LPL).
On statin and BB, ASA.
# Depression: Continue olanzapine  # Vit B12 deficiency: Monthly injections as outpatient  # Access: peripherals, PICC (discontinue after antibiotic course).
# Code: DNR but ok to undergo short periods of ventilation via tracheostomy if needed.
The patient's code status was re-adressed during his ICU stay and his current status is DNR, but willing to undergo short periods of ventilation via tracheostomy if needed.
