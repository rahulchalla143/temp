Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  Recommendations: Protonix 40mg IV BID Unclear source of bleeding.
Hospital course was complicated by cholangitis with subsequent biliary stent placement and profuse GI hemorrhage.
He was intubated for airway protection given his hematemesis.
The cause for the bleed was not definitively identified after 2 endoscopies, however, large clot burden was found in the biliary stent placed for cholangitis.
He was treated with IV proton-pump inhibitors and octreotide.
He also received several units of packed RBCs, however, he continued to pass blood per rectum and had increasing IV fluid and vasopressor requirements to maintain his blood pressure.
Because of his worsening clinical status and subsequent decompensation, a goals of care discussion was had with the family and he was ultimately made DNR/DNI with comfort measures only.
This found extrinsic compression of the biliary tree by tumor burden and a plastic stent was placed to open the drainage.
He was also started on ciprofloxacin and metronidazole and later broadened to Vanc/Zosyn.
He was treated with IV fluids with bicarbonate and allopurinol.
