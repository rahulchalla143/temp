B. CXR CHEST RADIOGRAPH  INDICATION: Status post left shoulder repair.
Brief Hospital Course: 48-year-old male with alcohol abuse that presents with resolved polysubstance withdrawal, confabulation, resolved delirium, resolved acute kidney injury secondary to pre-renal etiology and elevated CK, baseline tachycardia at 100 that is status post left proximal humerus ORIF/K-Rod ([**2139-10-28**]) and repair ([**2139-11-4**]) secondary to repeat fall vs. non-adherence to sling.
There was concern for thiamine deficiency and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and aggressive thiamine repletion was undertaken.
Given left humerus fracture, polytrauma was ruled out with CT Head not suggestive of bleed, CXR showed no evidence of traumatic injury, MRI of C-spine showed cervical spondylosis with a variety of abnormalities not suggestive of acute abnormality.
He has been working with addiction specialists at [**Hospital1 778**] but dropped out last Fall.
He was given appropriate nutrition, weaned off delirium-causing medications, and psychiatry was consulted for assessment.
He was initially placed on seroquel that caused orthostatic issues.
He was subsequently switched to abilify 5 mg with good effect and resolution of orthostasis.
Given this current issue, medication side effect with seroquel was found to be the likely etiology resulting in orthostasis.
It was likely attributed to a medication side effect.
# Left humerus fracture status post ORIF ([**2139-10-28**]) and status post repair ([**2139-11-4**]) after fall The patient had suffered a left humerus fracture from his fall.
He was made non-weight bearing on his LUE with a shoulder immobilization device.
He refused to wear his shoulder sling during his hospitalization and was warned about further injury.
He was discharged on motrin for pain.
In the post-op period, aspiration pneumonia and UTI were ruled out in addition to wound infection.There has been no identifiable source of infection with cultures, and UE US for DVT has been negative given Left > Right upper extremity swelling.
# Left extremity swelling and erythema Given warm and left greater than right upper extremity swelling, surgery was called to re-evaulate wound on initial surgery.
He extremity edema has nearly resolved on discharge.
# Neck pain, resolved The patient had complained of neck pain and was placed in a c-spine collar.
A JAK2 mutation was ordered to rule out underlying myleoproliferative disease, and he was placed on aspirin given platelets greater than 1090.
In addition given macrocytosis and B12 < 400, he was empirically treated for B12 deficiency in setting of folate therapy in order to avoid masking underlying neurological symptoms.
# Tobacco abuse Patient was counseled about tobacco abuse and given nicotine patch.
# Pending tests - BCx x 2 ([**11-7**]), Bcx x 2 ([**11-5**]), JAK2 mutation  # Outpatient considerations - Uptitration of Abilify to 15 mg based on symptoms (akathisia would be main side effect that can be treated with ativan).
