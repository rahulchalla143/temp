She was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma in [**1-/2196**] after having shortness of breath and anemia refractory to intravenous iron.
POST SURGICAL CARE AFTER HER NEPHRECTOMY ON [**2196-7-18**]: 1.
A left IJ clot after line placing requiring anticoagulation and leading to hematoma at nephrectomy site that required a 10-unit transfusion until stable.
A 21-day intubation with multiple failed attempts secondary to pulmonary edema.
On transfer to the Oncology Medicine service the patient was on 4 liters of oxygen nasal cannula, had sats in the high 90s but desaturated frequently overnight, requiring BIPAP, which she often refused.
She tolerated only honey nectar diet and was on aspiration precautions.
She was also being treated for a urinary tract infection.
VITALS ON ADMISSION TO THE ONCOLOGY MEDICINE SERVICE: Temperature 96.6, blood pressure 119/58, pulse of 114, respirations 28, and a 97% saturation on 4 liters of nasal cannula.
The impression was that she was an unfortunate 58-year-old woman with right renal cell carcinoma and metastases to her lung and newly diagnosed metastases to her brain status post nephrectomy for 29 days, severely malnourished, and deconditioned.
Neurosurgery was considering stereotactic surgery for the metastases, and Radiation Oncology was following the patient through the CCU stay into the OMED stay.
Her CHF was compensated, but she has hypervolemic, but diuresis was continued with Lasix and well maintained.
She was maintained on BIPAP every evening and nasal cannula throughout the day.
Endocrine:  The patient was hypothyroid, and Levothyroxine was continued.
She was maintained on iron every day and was given only prophylactic doses of Heparin subq given her risk of bleeding at her nephrectomy site.
For gastrointestinal she had no acute concerns, but she was covered with a bowel and nausea regimen and Protonix prophylaxis.
She was given tube feeds to improve her nutrition and was tolerating these well.
For deconditioning Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy were consulted to improve her status and set up home services for when she was ready for discharge.
As her diuresis was maintained and she was preparing for discharge, the patient was continuing to receive tube feeds, and on the evening of [**2196-8-20**] she was found, by the nurse, unresponsive in her room.
Patient was found to have vomited on her tube feeds.
She was resuscitated and intubated and taken to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
She was maintained on pressors and mechanical ventilation until her family arrived, at which time a plan of care was discussed with them and the medical time.
