He completed hemodialysis without any complications and had 2.5L of fluid removed.
His physical exam was normal; orthostasis, valsalva were not done.
He received aspirin 81 mg. Hct was at his baseline of 35, cardiac enzymes were CK: 103, MB: 7 and Trop-T: 0.27.
At that time he was treated with atropine and ended up with a wide-complex tachycardia requiring intubation and pressors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
LYMPH - no cervical, axillary, or inguinal LAD NEURO - awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact, muscle strength [**5-16**] throughout, sensation grossly intact throughout, DTRs 2+ and symmetric, cerebellar exam intact, gait not assessed PULSES:  Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ (DP and PT not assessed due to wrapping, will do in am before procedure)  Pertinent Results: Admission Labs ([**2169-8-9**]): WBC-7.1 HGB-11.3* HCT-35.6* PLT-207 GLUCOSE-88 UREA N-24* CREAT-4.3* SODIUM-140 POTASSIUM-3.9 CHLORIDE-98 TOTAL CO2-28 ANION GAP-18 CALCIUM-8.9 PHOSPHATE-3.2 MAGNESIUM-1.7 CK-MB-7, cTropnT-0.27*, CK(CPK)-103 PT-13.2 PTT-39.1* INR(PT)-1.1  CXR ([**2169-8-11**]): Compared with [**2169-8-10**], a single lead right-sided pacemaker is in place, with lead tip over right ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known firstname 1975**] [**Known lastname 5512**] is a 74 yo [**Known lastname 595**]-speaking male with h/o ESRD on HD, HTN, HL, and mild CAD who presented with asymptomatic bradycardia and underwent pacemaker placement.
He received a [**Company 1543**] single-lead pacemaker.
He had difficult access for the pacemaker, and required multiple sticks on the right side.
His pacemaker was in the correct place via follow-up CXR and an interrogation the morning after the procedure showed a normally functioning pacemaker.
His BP was highest post-dialysis, as he does not take his medications the morning before dialysis.
We increased his dose of clonidine 0.2mg po daily to 0.2mg po bid.
His BP stabilized by the time of discharge on these medications, although he would likely benefit from outpatient BP monitoring.
He was continued on aspirin 81mg po daily and he was started on simvastatin 40mg po daily.
# Chronic Kidney Disease Stage V on HD - patient dialyzed MWF while in house, and has follow-up with dialysis clinic.
His electrolytes were monitored and repleted, and calcium acetate and nephrocaps were continued.
Aspirin 81mg po daily was also continued.
He presented with diffuse wheezing that improved with his home medications and albuterol.
