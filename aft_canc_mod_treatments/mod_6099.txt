Rarely, however, LP HL can behave clinically in a more aggressive manner with widespread dissemination to bone marrow and other sites.
HIV-1 Viral Load/Ultrasensitive (Final [**2130-3-21**]):       HIV-1 RNA is not detected.
Histoplasma Quantitative Antigen EIA Result:  None Detected ng/ml(-)   Brief Hospital Course: 33M with a history of narcotic abuse who presented w 3 months of fevers, nightsweats, LAD and splenomegaly found to be pancytopenic upon presentation and subsequently diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma.
The patient was placed on steroids and then received one cycle of [**Doctor Last Name **]-dexa.
He tolerated this regimen without significant complication although he became quite uncomfortable once steroids were stopped.
As a result, he was placed on a steroid taper which he was instructed to continue to taper at his time of discharge.
Infectious Disease was consulted and recommended several viral PCRs as well as serologies be sent.
Given concern for non-specific infectious process status-post chemotherapy, the patient was started empirically on fluconazole and levofloxacin.
He was discharged on levofloxacin and asked to continue taking it until further discussion with his outpatient oncologist.
The patient had daily fevers until after completion of chemotherapy during which time he defervesced until his time of discharge.
Given his defervescence after chemotherapy in the setting of multiple negative cultures, it was felt that his initialy fevers were related to his lymphoma.
The patient clearly had significant pain related to his abdominal distention from his spleen which required low dose morphine SR with IR for breakthrough pain.
He was discharged with a limited script for these medications with a plan for down-titration with resolution of his HSM in the setting of lymphoma treatment.
