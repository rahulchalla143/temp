He received CTA for PE and ruled out MI, but did not want to be admitted for workup and left ED AMA.
CXR suggested possible post obstructive pna so he was placed on levaquin and flagyl.
Epinephrine 1:10,000 applied followed by argon plasma coagulation done, followed by coring out and excision of the tumor.
The LUL and LLL showed near complete obstruction, So mechanical debridement and argon plasma coagulation done to the distal left mainstem and LUL and LLL bronchi with only mild improvement of the patency.
Balloon dilation within the stent also done.
Bronchoscopy was performed again, and an occlusive mucuous plug of the left mainstem stent site was removed.

Past Medical History: -Cervical spinal laminectomy in [**2144**] and [**2146**] -Spinal fusion in [**2149**] -[**10/2156**], surgery for thyroid mass at [**Doctor Last Name 15594**] Medical Center -[**2168**], surgery for mass on his skull -[**2171-7-26**], brain tumor metastasis removed.
[**2171-11-8**] CXR There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax with deviation of the cardiomediastinum towards the left consistent with a new left upper lobe collapse.
ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.
Interval placement of a left main bronchus stent with opacification within the distal aspect of the stent and resorptive atelectasis of the left lower lobe with mediastinal shift to the left.
EGD [**2171-11-10**]: Blood in the esophagus Blood in the stomach Abnormal mucosa in the stomach Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: Prilosec 40mg [**Hospital1 **] for gastritis.
The ET tube tip is in appropriate position.
The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm with its tip not included in the field of view.

The mass was debrided and a stent was placed on [**11-9**].
The patient remained intubated and stayed in the MICU for a few days.
He will require home oxygen therapy with ambulation.
He is also using albuterol and atrovent PRN along with mucinex [**Hospital1 **] .
Patient will be seen by RadOnc to determine if he is a candidate for radiation treatment.
