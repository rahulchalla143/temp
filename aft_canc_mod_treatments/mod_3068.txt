Patient has a history of being heterozygous for Factor 5 Leiden and had a pulmonary embolism 7 months prior to admission and stopped anticoagulation 1 month prior to admission.
He was started on a heparin drip in the ED.
He remained on heparin gtt for treatment of his PEs except for during his colonoscopy.
He also was started on coumadin 5 mg daily for a goal INR of 2.0-3.0 per Heme-Onc.
The patient was offered lovenox or a lovenox bridge, but he declined and stated that he would rather be on coumadin.
Chest pain/pressure was relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin.
Patient was started on heparin drip in the ED and was started on Integrillin drip on hospital day 2 due to dynamic EKG changes.
He was started on pravastatin.
Patient was found to have guaiac positive stool before starting heparin drip.
Surgery was consulted for surgical management.
After this, he was taken to colonoscopy/EGD after turning off his heparin for 6 hours.
He returned after his procedure and re-started on his anticoagulation.
His goal INR was deemed to be [**12-29**], and he was offered Lovenox by Heme-Onc.
He is to follow up with surgery in [**Month (only) 1096**] for scheduling his laporascopic colectomy in [**Month (only) **]-[**2143-12-27**].
During hospitalization, his creatinine peaked at 2.0 after contrast dye loads but decreased to his baseline of 1.7 on discharge.
His outpatient furosemide dose was held while his Cr was elevated.
He will be scheduled with sleep study for possible evaluation of CPAP or BiPAP use in hopes of improving his pulmonary hypertension for his impending surgery for colorectal cancer.
His Imdur was held for a short time for his renal failure but was restarted on discharge.
His ACE-I was restarted and titrated during his hospitalization.
Patient takes NPH, glipizide and metformin at home.
He was given NPH plus ISS while in hospital.
His NPH was increased from his home dosing to 64 units in the morning and 37 units in the evening.
To stage colon cancer, it would be ideal to get CT lungs with contrast as outpatient.
The patient was kept on a heparin drip for treatment of his pulmonary embolism and this was bridged to coumadin at discharge.
