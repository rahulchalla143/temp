On [**2104-1-25**], he went to see his PCP for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] routine visit and because he had conjunctivitis.
He was started on Avelox for PNA, and referred to a pulmonologist.
His pulmonologist noted peripheral eosinophilia and started him on a course of prednisone 80mg PO daily x 3 days with a 20mg taper every 3 days which ended about a week ago.
He was started on IV heparin.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, melena, hematemesis, hematochezia.
PMH: HTN s/p T&A at age 4 .

Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %) secondary to hypo- to akinesis of the mid-distal anterior septum, apex, and distal lateral wall (anterior/inferior walls not well visualized).
Successful Export thrombectomy and PTCA only of proximal LAD thrombotic lesion.
Successful hemostasis of right radial arteriotomy with TR band.
Successful export thrombectomy and PTCA only of proximal LAD.
ASA while ok with heme/onc; integrilin for 12 hours; restart heparin per CCU team.
He was transferred to the CCU after patient developed an acute STEMI; cath demonstrated an acute thrombous in the LAD and he underwent PTCA and thrombectomy; no stents were deployed.
His CCU course was notable for tachycardia, volume overload (requiring IV lasix prn), several fevers with an episode of hypotension prompting the initiation of Abx in the setting of neutropenia, and initiation of chemo with etoposide and cytarabine for his AML.
His course was c/b ARDS and hypoxic respiratory failure, renal failure and volume overload requiring CVVH, and pericardial tamponade.
After the pt had been intubated for several weeks, he was transitioned to tracheostomy.
We d/c'd Allopurinol 300mg PO daily given uric acid levels <4 for about 2 days.
Pt was treated with etoposide and cytarabine given cardiotoxicity from anthracyclines (Etoposide 100 [**12-13**]/cytarabine 200 [**12-15**]).
In the cath lab he was found to have an acute thrombous in the LAD and underwent PTCA and thrombectomy; no stents were deployed.
On BMT, we stopped atorvastatin on [**3-27**] given possibility of drug-drug interaction with chemo drugs after consulting with cards.
Pt was not given heparin and ASA given falling PLTs.
A pericardial drain was placed on [**4-24**] and 500cc of bloody fluid was removed and drain left in place.
No right heart cath was done.
Drain put out 150mL bloody fluid overnight and then stopped draining the morning after it was placed.
Drain was pulled and pt was transferred back to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Prior to CMO status, the pt was being treated with amikacin, ambisome, Zosyn, linezolid.
Pt required pressors especially during CVVH volume removal.
Although CVVH was able to remove volume occasionally, volume removal was limited due to tenuous BP's.
He was maintained on a heparin drip.
#DVT and PE: Dx'd at OSH, initially was on heparin upon admission, until PLT's started to drop.
