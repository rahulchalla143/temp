She states that her symptoms did not improve, so she presented to an [**Hospital **] Care center on [**1-20**] and was started on Tamiflu for presumed influenza.
At [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital, she developed ARF with a creatinine peak of 2.4, which improved with aggressive hydration.
She had two CT abdomens, which were unremarkable, and she was started on Levofloxacin for a presumed CAP.
Yesterday, she developed a purpuric rash on her lower extremities, so she was started on IV Solumedrol for a presumed vasculitis.
Given her uncertain diagnosis, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup and evaluation.
She was continued on Levofloxacin and Solumedrol.
She was given Diltiazem 30 mg PO x1 and then developed a 7 second pause.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

PATHOLOGY: [**2106-2-1**] Skin Biopsy, right leg: Leukocytoclastic vasculitis with thrombi containing deposits consistent with cryoglobulinemia.
Right internal jugular line ends in the low SVC and nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
Monitoring and support devices remain in place and diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications persist.
Patient was intubated, put on ARDS low tidal volume protocol, though eventually required increased vent support and paralysis.
She was diagnosed with cryoglobulinemia by serum test as well as skin biopsy and was treated with solumedrol, underwent 5 sessions of plasmapheresis and received 1 dose of rituxan per rheumatology and heme/onc recs.
Pulmonary edema was felt to be a possible contributor so the patient was gently diuresed on a lasix drip with minimal improvement.
She eventually stopped diuresing to lasix and required CVVH to remove volume.
Fungal markers were sent (concern increased in setting of her immunosuppression) and were negative.
Micro data was notable for yeast on sputum and BAL, as well as a positive influenza A assay.
She was started on oseltamivir per ID recs.
She was also empirically started on antibiotics (first broadly w/ vanco and cefepime, then narrowed to levofloxacin) to treat a possible superimposed ventilator associated bacterial pneumonia.
She did not improve on the oseltamivir and was switched to zanamivir for a 10-day course, out of concern for possible drug resistance.
Was diagnosed with serum test as well as skin biopsy.
She was treated with high dose solumedrol, which was eventually tapered.
Completed 5 sessions of plasmapheresis per rhematology, heme/onc and derm.
She also received one dose of rituxan per rheum, but this was later discontinued as it was not felt to be indicated for her pulmonary distress.
Urine output improved with fluid rehydration, but then dropped again and azotemia was then attributed to steroids and later acyclovir.
# AFib with RVR: Throughout the hospitalization she had numerous episodes of AFib with RVR requiring boluses of IV metoprolol.
She was started on amiodarone.
Hepatology was consulted and did not recommend acute treatment of HCV.
She was treated with 1 dose of rituximab per heme/onc and rheumatology, with hepatology's support that therapy would not worsen viral hepatitis.
Rituximab was discontinued when it was felt that the primary pulmonary process was not cryoglobulinemia.
Patient was treated with a course of acyclovir.
Received a dose of fluconazole but felt that was likely fungal colonization of the Foley.
Foley catheter was changed.
# On [**2106-2-24**] following extensive discussions with the family, consistent with the patient's previously expressed wishes, decision to move to focus on patient comfort as the priority.
