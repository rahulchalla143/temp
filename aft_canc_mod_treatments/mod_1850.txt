male with h/o rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical mvr/avr, afib (s/p VVI PPM); CAD s/p x 2 with stenting of RCA and LAD; h/o CHF with preserved EF 55%; 2+MR around [**Location (un) 31820**] leakage around mechanical valve, recently discharged for severe CHF requiring natrecor, lasix and dopamine drips, chronic anemia, MDS, and more recent d/c for fall and ARF admitted to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital on [**2-10**].
Pt placed on BiPAP and transferred to ICU.
He was maintained on BIPAP, and diuresed on a natrecor drip, lasix drip, and dopamine for BP support .
He was started to be treated to a CAP but this was stopped secondary to decreased suspicion with Abx d/cd [**2129-2-14**] (do not know which abx).
Additionally, pt's coumadin was held there as pt got thoracentesis and he was bridged on a heparin gtt.
Pt also found to be c. diff positive and started on flagyl [**2129-2-15**].
Pt tells team that he has been compliant with low sodium diet and there have been no recent medication changes.
CAD - s/p cath [**2128-10-20**] with 3VD:  99% distal LAD, 60% LCx at origin of prior PTCA, RCA 50% distal with 70% RPL.
Prior LAD and RCA stents widely patent.
[**2128-7-30**]:stenting of the RCA with 3 overlapping cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] -[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] [**2128-8-11**]: rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the LAD/LCX.
PAF s/p VVI pacemaker [**7-28**] 5.
of perirectal abscess s/p surgery 9.
Also with mechanical click S2.
CHF- On the floor, he failed to diurese to natrecor and lasix, with dopamine for BP support.
Since he was also clearly volume overloaded, he was given diuril to augment diuresis with Lasix, which was effective.
The patient was ultimately controlled with levophed and a lasix drip alone which were both successfully weaned off.
His management was optimized with diuril 250 mg daily, lasix 100 mg [**Hospital1 **], digoxin 0.125 mg QOD given his renal dysfunction, and spironolactone 50 mg daily.
He was not placed on an ACE-I or beta-blocker given his relative hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the high 80s and 90s - which is his baseline blood pressure.
CAD- The patient was continued on a statin, plavix and ASA.
He was not placed on a beta-blocker given his low blood pressure.
Rhythm- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was monitored on telemetry with no issues.
He was placed on coumadin after his swan was discontinued and a heparin drip to bridge to coumadin.
He was continued on metronidazole 500 tid for 10 days treatment ([**2129-2-15**] 1st dose).
He was continue on iron/folate and transfused one unit during his stay.
The patient was restarted on epoetin 20,000 MWF.
Our goal Hct for him is to transfuse for Hct <27 as his hematocrit drops within a few days post transfusion regardless.
Nosocomial pneumonia - The patient was presumed to have a nosocomial pneumonia and placed on Zosyn for a 7 day course.
He was at first treated with diamox which had little effect on his serum bicarbonate and was thus, discontinued.
