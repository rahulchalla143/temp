Name:  [**Known lastname **],[**Known firstname **] A                 Unit No:   [**Numeric Identifier 10059**]  Admission Date:  [**2168-2-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-5-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2113-2-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ipratropium And Derivatives / Peanut Containing Products / Acyclovir  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2211**] Addendum: Please use Hospital course summary in addendum  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 54-year-old man w/ history of plasma cell leukemia/multiple myeloma who has hx of PE during treatment with  Revlimid, s/p recent DPACE treatment here with febrile neutropenia.
He was started on Cefepime monotherapy for febrile neutropenia and Bactrim and Valacyclovir were continued for PCP and HSV prophylaxis respectively.
He was also started on lovenox for DVT prophylaxis given his history of PE while on Revlimid.
Patient was started on pentostatin/TBI mini-allo SCT.
Revlimid and lovenox were stopped  prior to transplant.
Patient was given pentostatin and TBI.
He tolerated the transplant well but had muscle pain.
The patient remained AF post transplant, but had signs of worsening disease: (IgG increased to ?9000 and right middle lobe mass thought possibly to be a plasmacytoma showed increasing size on repeat CT.  Due to concern for recurrent disease, he was started thalidomide [**4-28**] for treatment of myeloma as his disease was previously responsive to this.
Given that he previously had a DVT/PE on this regimen, he was started on heparin gtt with a goal of 50-70  and give platelets with goal of >50.
He was started on posaconazole therapy at that time.
He required BiPAP at one point during his ICU stay but otherwise improved and his O2 requirement decreased with diuresis.
On [**5-3**] the patient was deemed to have disseminated aspergillosis and was started on voriconazole and caspofungin.
Ambisome was not started at this time because the patient was in acute renal failure from other causes.
On [**5-10**], due to progression of his renal failure the patient was started on dialysis and at this point ambisome was started in addition to continued voriconazole.
His renal failure was thought secondary to cyclosporin toxicity.
His cyclosporin was discontinued and he was started on cellcept and steroids.
A head CT w/ and w/out contrast was performed which showed "large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right parietal-occipital lobe region,  with extension into the right lateral and fourth ventricles, effacement of the basal cisterns, right hippocampal and subfalcine herniation.
The patient was not a candidate for aggressive surgical management and remained unresponsive.
He was made comfort measures only and expired at 1:32 on [**5-17**].
# GVHD: The was initially on IV cyclosporin for his transplant and his dose was titrated according to daily levels.
Cyclosporin was discontinued and cellcept/steroids started due to renal failure as described above.
The patient developed a new skin rash on [**5-10**] which was Day +34 post transplant that was thought consistent with GVHD.
His cellcept and solumedrol doses were adjusted in the days afterward to manage this problem.
On [**5-15**] he developed increasing bilirubin, the differential of which included GVHD and antifungals therapy.
Was started on metoprolol and eventually achieved control at metoprolol 75 mg. .
He was initially placed on Cefepime and Vancomycin, however after his cultures grew out he was changed to Meropenem and Vancomycin.
Multiple blood cultures were  negative and cefepime and vancomycin were stopped after he was afebrile for 2 weeks.
He went on to receive blood transfusions for the remainder of the hospitalization.
He developed a second rash on [**2-25**] which seemed related in timing to the initiation of Meropenem and Vancomycin.
As this was deemed the most appropriate antibiotic regimen, he was started on atarax 4x/day with good response in the rash.
Vorinconazole was stopped after 2 days and LFTs continued to rise for days and then trended down.
He was treated  with ursodiol as well.
