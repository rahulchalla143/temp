Prior to being transported from the ER, the patient was noted to have systolic pressures in the 60-70s, and was fluid resuscitated and transfused with packed red blood cells.
In Interventional Radiology, the source of the bleeding could not be identified despite the CTA, but due to deteriorating vital signs, the patient was electively intubated and transported to the MICU for further volume resuscitation.
In the MICU, the patient required pressors for a brief time to support his pressure, but was easily weaned soon after arrival.
On the day of discharge, the patient was taken for colonoscopy by GI who again noted extensive diverticular disease in the setting of only a fair prep, but did not identify a source of bleeding.
GI recommended a repeat colonoscopy in one year's time.
