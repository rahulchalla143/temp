On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to akinesis of the anterior septum, anterior free wall, and apex; and hypokinesis of the inferior septum and basal inferior free wall.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid- anterior and anteroseptal walls, as well as all distal LV segments.
