The patient was continued on Protonix 40 mg p.o.
In addition, he was found to have possible varices surrounding the ileostomy site and is to be started on Nadolol 20 mg p.o.
Although he remained afebrile, the patient was treated with clindamycin which will be continued for a total of a ten day course.
His white blood cell count decreased following the initiation of clindamycin and the patient's left elbow was clinically improved with decreased edema and erythema.
Furthermore, since he had no protein in his urine, the etiology of the edema was likely to be hypoalbuminemia from his poor nutritional state, combined with volume overload from his initial resuscitation.
The patient was diuresed using initially 40 mg of Lasix p.o.
He was diuresed roughly a total of 8 kilograms over four to five days and tolerated the diuresis well.
He had one brief episode of his blood pressure dropping into the high 80s systolic two days prior to discharge but this was presumed secondary to starting of Nadolol for ileostomy varices.
The patient's diuretic regimen should be 40 mg of Lasix p.o.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION: The patient, as mentioned, remained total body overloaded.
He had significant hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia with his diuresis and required aggressive potassium and magnesium supplementation during the diuresis.
From a nutrition standpoint, the patient is malnourished and was continued on a high protein diet with t.i.d.
The patient received 1 unit of packed red cells on the floor and his hematocrit was otherwise stable, ranging between roughly 26.5 and 30.
The patient was continued on erythropoietin and iron.
