On [**2164-9-17**] the patient was continued on total parenteral nutrition and continued to have laboratories checked.
On [**2164-9-19**] the patient was continued on total parenteral nutrition and was on the floor at this time receiving wound care to her stoma site with Nugauze.
She continued on total parenteral nutrition throughout this period and was then prepared for eventual abdominal closure and likely fistula take-down.
The important aspects of her care at this point were improving her nutritional status through the use of total parenteral nutrition.
Albumin, transferrin, ferritin and iron every Monday.
Of note, the patient was also on Lovenox for anticoagulation at  this time for atrial fibrillation.
She was eventually converted to warfarin and her INR was checked 3 times a week during the period leading up to surgery as she was prepared.
She was also on Digoxin at this time with levels being checked routinely and had been placed on Levofloxacin on [**2164-10-20**] for a urinary tract infection.
She underwent a 5 day course and the infection was noted to have resolved and the antibiotics were able to be stopped.
For both of these events she was treated with Vancomycin and fluconazole in addition to Flagyl and Levofloxacin.
She continued to be prepared for surgery which was supposed to take place at the end of [**Month (only) **].
The peripheral inserted central catheter from 2 months before ended up growing back staph enterococcus that was presumed to be possibly Vancomycin resistant.
The patient was started on linezolid during this time and completed a 2 week course.
The bulk of the management for the interval from [**9-17**] into early [**Month (only) 1096**] was for this complex wound management and optimization of her nutrition prior to the embarkment upon repair of such complicated fistulae and hernias.
It was determined that the patient was adequately preoperatively prepared and having been treated for her line complication.
She was brought to the operating room on [**2164-12-25**] and underwent an enterectomy with anastomosis with enteroenterostomy, excision of enterotomies, jejunostomy tube placement, adhesiolysis of abdominal adhesions of extensive nature, repair of incisional hernia and implantation of mesh for repair of incisional hernia and myocutaneous fascial flap for repair of incisional hernia.
The case went as planned and the patient was able to tolerate the procedure well with blood loss of approximately 150 ml.
Significant findings during the case were 4 separate enterocutaneous fistulae with resulting 8 separate small bowel openings, a large area of incisional hernia secondary to dehiscence and removal of prosthetic mesh following her previous repair and a total of 24 inches of small intestine that were removed.
She was able to be extubated on postoperative day 2 without any difficulties and was weaned and her nasal cannula oxygen was weaned during this time.
Her tube feeds were then restarted at a trophic rate of 10 ml per hour and gradually increased to 60 ml per hour at a rate of increase of approximately 10 ml per increment every 1 to 2 days.
Also of note the patient was started with physical therapy again after her operation to increase her activity and to improve her likelihood of success in terms of her rehabilitation.
She had some occasional issues with pain that was treated with Percocet elixir as well as occasional issues with anxiety for which she received lorazepam 0.5 mg IV q 8 hours as needed.

From a gastrointestinal standpoint she was on lansoprazole oral suspension given once daily for acid suppression.
She was on tube feeds, Impact with Fiber at half strength that is 60 ml per hour with feedings held for residuals for 100 ml checked very 4 hours.
She was on Boost breakfast, lunch and dinner supplements as tolerated.
Genitourinary: Patient was without Foley catheter at the time of discharge and was urinating without issue at the time of discharge and making between 1-1/2 and 2 liters a day.
However, the goal was to bring her international normalized ratio up to 2.5 or thereabouts on warfarin and on the day of discharge she still had not achieved that goal and was receiving 2 and 5 mg of warfarin dosage daily with the goal INR as stated before.
Endocrine: Patient was on a regular insulin sliding scale postoperatively.
She was also on levothyroxine which was continued throughout the postoperative period with plans for her to be discharged on 100 mcg once daily.
The patient had had several infections during her hospital stay that were treated with various and sundry antibiotics such as linezolid, levofloxacin, fluconazole, Vancomycin, metronidazole, etc.
For prophylactic regimen the patient at this time was on lansoprazole oral suspension 30 m daily as mentioned before.
The patient was on heparin 5,000 units subcutaneously 3x a day.
