She is, therefore, being admitted now for surgical excision of a right occipital lesion.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Hernia repair in the past.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Due to the clinical findings, the patient was seen as an outpatient previously by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] and, therefore, admitted and taken to the Operating Room on the morning of [**2144-8-12**] where under general endotracheal anesthetic the patient underwent a right occipital craniotomy and excision of tumor.
The patient tolerated the procedure quite well overnight in the PACU and was subsequently transferred to the floor.
Her course was subsequently complicated by some coffee ground emesis and drainage on a NG tube and she was seen by the GI service for an upper GI bleed.
She was given a tapering dose of steroids as well as a prescription for analgesics.
