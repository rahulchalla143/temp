Admission Date:  [**2128-10-30**]     Discharge Date:  [**2128-11-16**]  Date of Birth:   [**2076-2-29**]     Sex:  F  Service:  Surgery, Purple Team  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old female, status post right cephalic vein port placement and laparoscopic-assisted jejunostomy tube placement on [**2128-10-29**].
The patient presented on [**2128-10-30**] with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Medications included Prevacid, Roxicet, multivitamin, and calcium.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Purple Surgery Service and treated with antiemetics, and medication, as well as intravenous hydration for possible postoperative ileus.
On hospital day two, she was noted to have increasing amounts of gastric dilatation and increasing amounts of discomfort, starting at approximately 11 o'clock that afternoon.
She was subsequently taken to the operating room for re-exploration and revision of her jejunostomy tube placement.
Approximately 2 liters of gastric content was estimated to have entered the lungs and was rapidly suctioned out; however, attempts at extubation failed, and the patient was ultimately transferred to the Intensive Care Unit with a presumed diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to her aspiration.
On [**2128-10-31**], the patient was maintained intubated in the Intensive Care Unit.
She was gradually weaned from the ventilator over the next several days until she was extubated on postoperative day eight.
She was started on ceftazidime and Zosyn that was ultimately converted from Zosyn to ciprofloxacin.
Tube feeds were started on postoperative day eight and were brought to goal by postoperative day thirteen.
The patient was started on a heparin drip at that time, and over the next several days was converted toward Coumadin.
She was discharged home on tube feeds at 120 cc per hour times 15 hours.
She was given oxygen therapy; predominately because of anxiety that she was dealing with over feelings of air hunger.
She was also given Lovenox injections.
All of this was accomplished through the aid of a visiting nurse who was going to help the patient with delivery of medications, the Lovenox injections, and the tube feeds, as well as assisting with monitoring Coumadin in concert with the local physician.
Status post jejunostomy tube placement and port placement complicated by small-bowel obstruction requiring re-exploration and jejunostomy tube revision, complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome subsequent to aspiration.
