MRI is more sensitive for evaluation of the thecal sac and its contents.
The left kidney measures 10.5 cm.
UNRESPONSIVENESS: Given known CNS lymphoma, the pt's altered mental status was concerning for hemorrhagic event or critical mass effect, which were not found in the original CT scan and appeared  unlikely given overall regression on imaging and lack of systemic anticoagulation.
Seizure activity was considered, however she had been on Keppra and  Dilantin.
Her unresponsiveness was likely multifactorial with strong contribution from low dose IV Ativan and IV Morphine given for tachypnea.
Respiratory failure: Patient had respiratory distress and then respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation.
She completed a 7 day course of vancomycin and zosyn on [**2116-3-10**].
Hypernatremia: The patient was diagnosed with central DI supported by urine osms and lytes which required DDVAP and later improved.
She further received desmopresin at 2 mcg daily.
She required levophed to maintain her BP.
Based on the recent history of UTI, she was given a 7-day course of vanco and zosyn that she completed on [**2116-3-10**].
She was given stress dose steroids which were being tappered upon discharge.
The target was prednisone 5 mg daily.
Her dilantin was originally held due to supra-therapeutic levels.
She was given dilantin 100IV on [**2116-3-9**].
Dilantin takes several days to reach steady state so on Dilantin levels were on target at 12.6 (total dose corrected for albumin).
She required transfusion while in the ICU.
Initially no further treatment was considered, due to multiple medical comorbidities.
After patient recovered from the hypotension episodes and after multiple family meetings assessing goals of care, on [**2116-3-12**] decision was made to pursue whole-brain radiation salvation therapy, despite the low probability of recuperating.
# HTN: Early in the hospitalization, blood pressure was controlled with alpha-methyl dopa.
Arrangements were made for PEG placement on [**2116-3-13**], but patient expired prior to procedure.
# PPX:  DVT ppx with SQ Heparin  and a bowel regimen.
