The presumed diagnosis at that time was overdose of suboxone or other substance abuse.
Pathology: pineocytoma or pineoblastoma, limited by available tissue - s/p one treatment of radiation [**2186-11-6**] at [**Hospital1 2025**]  OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: Asthma Appendectomy Parinaud syndrome PFO   Social History: Currently lives with mother; recent homelessness.
Continues to take Suboxone (buprenorphine) prescribed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**University/College **], MA; continuse to have polysubstance use at this time.
Per patient, has been trading Suboxone with friends.
Denies other illicits, specifically including heroin or IVDU.
Dad, alive at healthy in his 60s Mom, alive and healthy at 57 y/o (anxiety disorder)   Physical Exam: VS: T 96.5, BP 143/78, HR 80, RR 18, 98%RA Pain: none GEN: young man lying in bed awake HEENT: EOMI, sclera anicteric, conjunctivae clear, OP moist and without lesion NECK: Supple, no JVD CV: Reg rate, normal S1, S2.
Status post externalization of the right transfrontal ventricular drain, with expected small amount of hemorrhage along the tract, small pneumocephalus and trace intraventricular hemorrhage.
Correlate clincially for catheter function and if the position of the tip is desirable.
Pineal mass, unchanged  [**1-20**] - [**1-22**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG due to the presence of a slow background which reached a maximum of a 6 Hz frequency.
Persistent hydrocephalus, increased compared with prior despite presence of VP shunt and recent shunt exchange.
Brief Hospital Course: 26 yo M with pinealoma s/p VP shunt presenting with altered mental status including lethargy and marked psychomotor slowing.
The patient was cocaine positive in the urine and given his known history of polysubstance abuse including marijuana, barbituates, suboxone and alcohol, a toxic ingestion initially was felt to be the most likely explanation.
However, his mother and sisters relayed a history of subacute or chronic lethargy and psychomotor slowing for many weeks with intermittent exacerbations requiring hospitalization including in mid [**Month (only) 1096**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] when he was barbiturate positive.
With conservative management including hydration and supportive care, the patient failed to show significant improvement.
Concern was also raised by the neurology resident about the possibility of a melatonin dysregulation syndrome associated with his pinealoma - continued research on this possibility is ongoing.
Psych consult felt there was no role for physicatric medication while in house and that he should be followed as an outpatient.
The patient will continue to follow-up as an outpatient for ongoing care of his pinealoma including consideration of future proton beam therapy through the [**Hospital1 2025**] as well as a drug rehab program at the same site.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] in preparation for surgery to revise his VP shunt.
Upon entering the operating room, it was felt his shunt may have not been functioning distally so the proximal portion was removed and a new catheter was placed as an EVD.
He tolerated the procedure well and was trasnferred to the ICU post-operatively.
On [**1-7**] he began to wake up a bit more however became increasingly tachycardic and diaphoretic and as such was started on Bromocriptine for "brain storm" in conjunction with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 87490**] the neurointensivist.
EEG leadsd were also placed to monitor for seizure activity.
He continued wtih brainstorms which were being treated with dilaudid and hydralazine/metoprolol.
He was started on decadron to see if it would assist with awakening.
Brainstorm treatment was changed to versed prn and all long acting benzo's and narcotics were discontinued.
Neuro and rad onc saw the patient and felt that he would benefit from proton beam radiation which will occur after his shunt is revised and he will be trasnferred to [**Hospital1 2025**].
On [**1-10**] he remained stable in the ICU and was pre-op'd for his shunt revision.
A strata valve was placed and set at 0.5 initially.
He was transported to the ICU for furthe management and observation and remained stable while there.
He was planned to have a PEG placed and free water was started through his NG tube for a serum sodium of 156.
He awaited PEG placement on [**1-18**] and received his PEG on the morning of [**1-19**].
The neurology team noticed that the patient had some facial twitching therefore they ordered a continuous EEG and an MRI.
He was discharged to [**Hospital1 2025**] on [**2187-1-26**]  Medications on Admission: albuterol inh prn  Discharge Medications: 1. thiamine HCl 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
