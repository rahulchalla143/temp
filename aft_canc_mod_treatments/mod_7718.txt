The patient was treated with Vancomycin which was later switched to Linezolid secondary to rash with Vancomycin.
The patient was admitted to the Fenard ICU service and started on Ceftazidine, Bactrim and prednisone for presumed PCP which was later changed to Clindamycin primaquine due to fear of bone marrow suppression, Levaquin and Linezolid.
The patient was also given 6 liters of normal saline with increased in blood pressure to 94/58.
Ceftazidine was discontinued and induced sputum sent for PCP.
Treatment was complicated by PIC line associated septic thrombophlebitis treated with Vancomycin initially which was then changed to Linezolid due to diffuse macular papular rash.
History of prostate adenocarcinoma status post radical prostatectomy.
Vancomycin causes rash.
Questionable reaction to Oxicillin and Allopurinol as these were all given at the same time Vancomycin was given and is questionable whether these were responsive for the patient's initial rash.
