A nasogastric tube has also been placed with the distal tip just reaching the gastroesophageal junction.
IMPRESSION: Endotracheal tube in satisfactory position as above.
A wide stent has replaced a biliary drainage catheter since [**2116-6-25**].
A nasogastric tube is coiled in the upper stomach.
Brief Hospital Course: 86M w/ cholangiocarcinoma s/p metal biliary stenting, now with hematemesis and likely aspiration pneumonia .
Two large bore peripheral IVs were placed, blood was typed and crossmatched but pt did not require transfusion as serial Hct was stable.
BP was maintained with IVF with central venous pressure monitoring, and once CVP >12, norepiphrine was administered to maintain MAP >65.
For the bleeding, octreotide and pantoprazole drips were administered and gastroenterology was consulted for EGD.
Broad spectrum antibiotics including coverage for aspiration pneumonia were administered.
Arterial line for BP monitoring was placed and central venous line for CVP monitoring and medication infusion was placed.
Pt received volume resuscitation with IVF to goal CVP 12 and then norepiphrine was administered to keep MAP goal >65.
A cosyntropin stim test showed relative adrenal insufficiency, so stress dose hydrocortisone was administered.
Pt initially had acute respiratory acidosis and a large A-a gradient; consistent with aspiration, but during the 12 hour period after admission, lactic acidosis developed and worsened despite treatment of septic shock.
Minute ventilation was increased to compensate, but PCO2 continued to rise with falling pH despite these measures.
Not on beta blocker at home.
# HTN: hold spironolactone, lasix, given shock.
# Parkinson's disease: continue outpt sinemet  # Depression: continue home regimen of bupropion, methylphenidate  # Goals of Care: DNR, discussed with daughter/HCP on admission.
As the patient's clinical status continued to deteriorate despite aggressive medical supports, the family, after consultation with the MICU team and the GI consult team, decided that Mr [**Known lastname **] would prefer to be made comfortable rather to undergo further invasive procedures with a low likelihood of benefit in terms of survival and quality of life if he did survive.
Therefore, with his family gathered at the bedside, all medications except analgesics and anxiolytics were stopped and the ventilator was changed to a T-piece with humidified O2.
