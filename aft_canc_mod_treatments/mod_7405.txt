On [**2122-10-1**], the patient had bilateral mastectomy and lymph node dissection.
On [**2122-2-13**], the patient had one cycle of Taxol complicated by pulmonary edema.
The patient also has received Arimidex briefly and Femara on [**4-24**].
On [**2122-2-14**], the patient was admitted to [**Hospital 2725**] Hospital with congestive heart failure and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and was started on Amiodarone.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, this is a 55 year old female with a past medical history of breast cancer, status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy who presented on [**2122-10-4**], with hypotension and delirium.
She is status post bilateral mastectomy with five out of twelve positive lymph nodes on the right and three out of nine positive lymph nodes on the left.
The patient had four cycles of Adriamycin and one cycle of Taxol which was complicated by pulmonary edema.
Four days before admission, the patient initiated radiation therapy times four days.
Antibiotics with Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin and Flagyl were started before blood cultures were sent.
The patient responded to multiple fluid boluses and antibiotics were continued.
After Adenosine was initiated, the patient converted to sinus briefly and then a wide complex tachycardia.
Lidocaine was given and a drip was started.
The patient was then bolused with Amiodarone and started on Amiodarone drip.
The patient was also intubated for lactic acidemia.
Electrophysiology felt that the patient had atrial fibrillation with aberrancy and was recommending continuing the Amiodarone drip.
After approximately one week, the Amiodarone drip was changed to p.o.
Amiodarone 300 mg p.o.
Anticoagulation was not started since the patient was thrombocytopenic at the time (platelets nadired to 32,000).
The patient was started on Lopressor 12.5 mg t.i.d.
The patient was started on Dobutamine and Levophed.
The patient continued to remain hemodynamically unstable and was started briefly on Dopamine and Neo-Synephrine.
The patient then improved and eventually all drips, Lidocaine, Levophed, Dobutamine, Dopamine and Neo-Synephrine were discontinued.
The Swan was discontinued and diuresis was initiated.
The patient's respiratory status improved postthoracentesis and aggressive diuresis was again initiated with Lasix 120 mg intravenously t.i.d.
The patient was extubated on [**2122-10-19**], but did require BiPAP overnight.
On [**2122-10-20**], a Lasix drip was started.
The patient was also started on Captopril and titrated up to 100 mg t.i.d.
