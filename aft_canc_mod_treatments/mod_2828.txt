Admission Date:  [**2166-6-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-7-4**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**] Chief Complaint: Fall down stairs  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p C3-7 posterior laminectomies and fusion  History of Present Illness: 82year old man with a past medical history significant for cervical spondylosis, a.fib, and renal cell ca who presents [**6-15**] with a fall at home and C3-4 cord contusion (with baseline exam of plegic LUE, mild finger flexion in RUE, and could bend both knees against gravity), who is now 1day postop C3-7 laminectomies/fusion and was found this am by the nurses to be "unresponsive."
His coumadin was stopped as well.
Medicine and cardiology consults were called for pre-op evals - recommended bp control (hydral and lopressor for sbp > 160, and aspirin post-op.
Patient underwent laminectomy yesterday, arriving in the PACU at 1pm, course unremarkable and transferred back to floor.
Therefore, he was given total of 2mg of ativan empirically, and patient became more drowsy with eyes now rhythmically moving right and left.
So far no treatment as he was deemed not candidate for nephrectomy given cardiac status.
4.bph s/p turp 5.right lung nodule - stable in size for over 2yrs 6.family reports history of "tortuous" carotid with episodes of syncope in past when he turned head to right- was on dilantin/phenobarbital per family.
The surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures appear unremarkable  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: The patient is an 82yo man with a h/o a.fib, htn, and cervical spondylosis who p/w fall down stairs, and C3-4 cord contusion.
One day s/p cervical laminectomies and C3-C7 fusion pt was found non-response.
MRI C-spine showed increased signal C3-4 c/w cord contusion/edema, given dx of central cord syndrome, Coumadin d/ced, and pt was started on steroids in ED.
He was transferred from SICU to floor on [**6-18**] where pt was cleared by cardiology perspective for C3-C7 laminectomy except BP diff to control on hydralazine, clonidine, and lopressor.
Differential dx at that time included ?embolic vs hemorrhagic CVA vs nonconvulsive seizures.
Due to concerns for possible nonconvulsive status epilepticus, he was given 2 mg ativan and dilantin load with improvement in eye deviation though as yet no significant improvement in mental status.
Neurology felt that pt may have likely had status epilepticus possibly from old R frontal infarct or alternatively, he may have suffered a new infarct related to his a.fib given his known afib and need to hold coumadin prior to surgery (although INR was 2.0 [**6-23**] AM).
Pt was maintained on ASA 325 mg qd for the remainder of admission.
At midnight, pt found to have increased work of breathing and using accessory muscles with RR high 20s with O2 sats high 80s on NRB.
Placed on AC TV 600 x16 (actually breathing at 22), FIO2 100%, PEEP 5.
Pt was transferred to MICU for further management.
He was covered from [**6-24**] by clindamycin 600 mg tid and levofloxacin 250 mg qd.
FEN: Pt was NPO on admission and placed on maintenance fluids.
Pt was placed on tube feeds per nutrition recommendations in the MICU.
PPx: Pt was maintained on pneumoboots and protonix throughout his admission.
The pt's family, including the pt's wife (also his health care proxy), decided that a continued trial of tube feeds via Dobhoff tube was the most appropriate next step for his care.
Pt is to be transferred to Sunny [**Hospital **] Hospice care with NG tube in place.
The family will continue to discuss the option of removing tube feeds.
