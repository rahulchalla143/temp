This persisted for two weeks prompting him to go to an OSH where a chest X-ray appeared consistent with RLL pneumonia and was started on antibiotics.
At this point, the patient was electively intubated for flexible bronchoscopy; this showed carinal mass with active slow bleeding that was refractory to cold saline and epinephrine.
Ablation and excision of the lesion was performed along with stenting.
There was brisk bleeding at the site of excision necessitating maintenance of endotracheal intubation.
