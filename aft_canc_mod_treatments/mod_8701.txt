She notes these are the same exact symptoms she had when she was first diagnosed with lymphoma in [**2148**].
Approximately 1 month ago, she underwent a bone marrow biopsy and mediastinoscopy with subcarinal node biopsy that were, per the patient's report, unrevealing.
She established care here at [**Hospital1 18**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] shortly after these studies, and underwent rigid bronchoscopy [**2160-8-6**] for lymph node biopsy (around the RLL).
The day of her procedure she was NPO all day, and only received 700cc fluid in the OR.
She was given demerol and tylenol for rigors, started on vanc and zosyn, then sent to the MICU.
As for recent infections, she was treated at [**Hospital1 2177**] for PNA in [**5-8**], and was treated with a z-pack without resolution of symptoms.
**Of note, she has port in place from [**Location (un) 745**] [**Location (un) 3678**] from [**2149**], which has not been accessed since her chemotherapy treatments finished.

[**2160-8-6**] Cytology EBUS TBNA LEVEL 7 Lymph node (Level 7), EBUS-TBNA: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.Bronchial epithelial cells and polymorphous lymphocytes consistent with lymph node sampling (see note).
[**2160-8-8**] Pathology Tissue: right cervical lymph node SPECIMEN: RIGHT CERVICAL LYMPH NODE, BIOPSY.
Special stains for mycobacterial ([**Last Name (un) 18566**] and AFB), AND fungal (PAS, Mucicarmine and GMS) organisms are negative.
Only rare cells exhibit immunoreactivity for CD20, BCL6, MUM1, or CD30.
[**2160-8-9**] Pathology Tissue: BONE MARROW CORE BIOPSY SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY.
DIAGNOSIS:CELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH MATURING TRILINEAGE HEMATOPOIESIS AND NO MORPHOLOGIC EVIDENCE OF INVOLVEMENT BY LYMPHOMA, SEE NOTE.
Note:  The findings of increased macrophages with ingestion of cells and debris, as well as an increased cytotoxic T cell infiltrate with concurrent markedly elevated ferritin level, raise the possibility of a primary, or more likely secondary, macrophage activation syndrome.
The aorta and pancreas were not adequately imaged due to body habitus.
Prominent 9-mm portal venous lymph node is non-specific and may relate to underlying lymphoma or liver disease.
[**2160-8-9**] Radiology CHEST FINDINGS:  As compared to previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.
DLCO: The Diffusing Capacity corrected for hemoglobin is moderately reduced.
[**2160-8-16**] Radiology UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS FINDINGS:  Evaluation is limited due to patient body habitus and overlying edema.
Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral common femoral, right superficial femoral, and right popliteal veins were performed.
Right calf veins were not clearly visualized.
Diffuse interstitial lung abnormality with traction bronchiectasis and fibrosis which is may be due to NSIP is similar compared to the prior study except for new bilateral pulmonary nodules.
The findings are similar to those present on a previous biopsy of a right cervical lymph node (S12-31209A).
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 55yoF with a h/o Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed in [**2148**], treated with 6 cycles of chemotherapy [**2149**]-[**2150**] (no radiation), and asthma who presents with 5 months of B-symptoms (afternoon fevers to 102, chills, night sweats, progressive shortness of breath, easy bruising); admitted after developing tachycardia, hypotension, and fever in the PACU status post rigid bronchoscopy for mediastinal LN biopsy.
Following extensive work up, patient was found to have hypogammaglobulinemia and prolonged EBV viremia, possibly resulting in her abnormal LFTs, nephrotic syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome.
Active Diagnoses:  # Macrophage activating syndrome: Cellular debris within macrophages on bone marrow biopsy, admission ferritin 11k.
Extensive W/U including multiple lymph node biopsies all inconclusive.
-Patient had persistent pleural effusion following video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.
Chest tube was removed [**2160-8-27**] for decreased drainage, but drainage persisted for [**3-30**] days after but had resolved by time of discharge.
-Patient has an appointment with thoracic surgery for follow up and suture removal.
Patient with [**Last Name (un) **] on admission (Cr 1.5), developed extensive anasarca with 24 hr urine protein 8 grams and hypoalbuminemia.
She did have one isolated episode of leg pain, ultrasound with doppler did not show DVT, leg edema remained symmetric.
Renal was consulted, advised treatment with lasix and lisinopril.
- Continue lisinopril 5mg, hold for SBP <100 - Continue diuresis with 40 PO lasix [**Hospital1 **], hold for SBP <90 - Elevate legs, wrap as needed - Follow up with nephrology as scheduled [**2160-10-8**]  # Hypogammaglobulinemia: Acquired vs. inherited, possible common variable immune deficiency (CVID).
Normal IgG, low IgA and IgM, no response to pneumococcal vaccine given [**5-21**].
Immunology was consulted, agreed with trial of monthly IVIG infusion with goal of eradicating EBV viremia.
- Patient should avoid hepatotoxic medications and alcohol  # Pancytopenia: Most likely related to EBV or macrophage activation syndrome.
CBC was trended, she required transfusion of platelets only on one occasion and transfusion of pRBC on two occasions.
Chronic issues: #Asthma: Patient was treated with albuterol and ipratroprium nebs.
She was treated with supplimental O2 as needed.
The DLCO was reduced out of proportion to the reduction in  TLC, consistent with an interstitial process, likely due to bleomycin toxicity.
Transitional Issues: # Outpatient follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] to discuss possible initiation of steroids # Will have outpatient follow up with renal # Monthly IVIG infusion at heme/onc clinic # Access: Hickman catheter in place- 10 years per hx # Patient has been spiking low grade temps likely related to her underlying disease process, please call Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3760**] if temperature above 101F or change in clinical status.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mrs. [**Known lastname **],  It was a pleasure taking part in your care during your hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**].
You had a procedure called a bronchoscopy to obtain a biopsy of your enlarged lymph nodes, following which you had low blood pressures and difficulty breathing, for which you required a brief stay in the intensive care unit.
To further investigate the cause of your symptoms you underwent biopsies of your bone marrow, kidney and lymph nodes in your lung and neck.
You were treated with a medicine called IVIg to give you extra antibodies, and were stable to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility to improve your strength.
You should continue to take the lisinopril and lasix as directed in your medication list to decrease the swelling in your legs, and follow up with the kidney doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) **].
Wash incision with mild soap & water, rinse, pat dry * No tub bathing, swimming or hot tubs until incision healed * No lotions or creams to incision site * Walk 4-5 times a day and gradually increase your activity as you can tolerate.
Someone from his office will call you to notify you of the time and date of your appointment.
