The patient reportedly found by police unconscious on her living room floor with multiple empty bottles of vodka in the house.
The patient was found hypothermic with a body core temperature of 86 degrees Fahrenheit and hypoglycemic with a fingerstick blood glucose brought to [**Hospital 26200**] Hospital where she was found to have a blood alcohol level of 320 with a persistent temperature in the mid 80s degrees Fahrenheit.
In the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 69**], the patient was treated with warming blankets, warm saline infusions, and warm bladder irrigation, and her body core temperature subsequently rose to 92 degrees Fahrenheit.
The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications were also unknown at the time of admission; however, subsequent to conversation with the primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was noted that the patient was prescribed enalapril 5 mg p.o.
The patient's speech was slurred; however, the patient was noted to be following commands and in no acute distress.
Initial cardiac enzymes revealed creatine kinase was 162, CK/MB was 6, and troponin was less than 0.3.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was initially admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where the patient's core body temperature normalized with continuous warming measures without noted cardiac complications.
An arterial line and central venous access (left subclavian) were placed for close monitoring and rapid treatment.
The patient's hypothermia on admission was of unclear etiology with a differential diagnosis including hypothyroidism, sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, alcohol intoxication, hypoglycemia, as well as insulin overdose.
The Hematology/[**Hospital **] Clinic was consulted and suggested chronic lymphocytic leukemia as the most probable diagnosis based on smudge cells found on peripheral blood smear, the absence of bands on white blood cell differential, and the absence of obvious lymphadenopathy.
However, Hematology/Oncology could not rule out other etiologies; and blood work was sent for cytology and cytogenetic studies.
The patient was noted to have a macrocytic anemia during the hospitalization with an initial hematocrit of 41, with a mean cell volume of 108; which, following intravenous fluid repletion, subsequently decreased to a hematocrit ranging from 29 to 31.
A subsequent vitamin B12 level (300) and folate level (6.1) were within normal limits; making nutritional causes a less likely factor.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable within the range of 29 to 31 throughout the remainder of the hospitalization, and did not require transfusion support.
The patient was subsequently started on heparin; and following the placement of a peripheral intravenous line, the subclavian line was pulled without complications.
The patient was maintained on heparin for 24 hours before changing to Lovenox therapy.
The elevated INR was felt likely related to the supratherapeutic PTT; however, the patient was also on antibiotics which may have contributed.
The patient was started on vitamin K 10 mg p.o.
Although the lymphocytosis was potentially related to a profound viral illness, it was felt more likely related to a primary hematologic process.
The patient was subsequently started on empiric levofloxacin for concern of potential pneumonia in an amino-compromised patient.
The levofloxacin was continued for empiric coverage/prophylactic coverage for a total of a 7-day course.
ENDOCRINE SYSTEM:  An assessment of the etiology of the hypothermia, thyroid studies, as well as hemoglobin A1c were measured.
NEUROLOGY/PSYCHIATRY SYSTEM:  The patient was found unconscious on admission; however, regained consciousness following administration of dextrose, intravenous fluids, as well as rewarming.
The lactic acidosis slowly resolved with fluids with a closure of the anion gap on hospital day two.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient was initially placed on half normal saline with potassium repletion for maintenance fluids.
The fluids were discontinued on transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit with the resumption of the patient's normal diet.
The patient required minimal electrolyte repletion throughout the hospitalization.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Enalapril 5 mg p.o.
Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
Thiamine 100 mg p.o.
Folic acid 1 mg p.o.
Multivitamin one tablet p.o.
Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous q.12h.
Vitamin K 10 mg p.o.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was to be discharged to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital for acute rehabilitation with continued Physical Therapy as well as Occupational Therapy.
The patient has a number of social issues to work out with regard to her living situation status post rehabilitation hospital discharge.
The patient's two sons are aware of the patient's current situation, and it was hoped that the patient's son would become increasingly involved in her post rehabilitation care.
