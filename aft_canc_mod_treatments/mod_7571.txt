[**2146-6-27**]: Exploratory laparotomy with washout, repair of perforation in ileum, placement of vacuum-assisted closure dressing.
Jejunoileal bypass, [**2109**] (16 inches of jejunum anastomosis     to the last 6 inches of ileum) appendectomy was performed at      that time.
Open cholecystectomy with choledochostomy tube and     gastrostomy tube for acute gallstone pancreatitis, [**2109**].
Cystoscopic attempted stone extraction and stenting,     [**2145-5-21**].
Surgical extraction of right renal stone, [**2145-6-4**].
Pt was evaluated by anaesthesia and taken to the operating room where a laparoscopic adjustable gastric band placement was performed.
Pain was well controlled with IV pain medications.
Following that the patient was placed on multiple pressors by the ICU team.
He was intubated and his PEEP was optimized using an intraesophageal balloon.
He remained intubated until the decision of comfort measures only was executed terminally extubating the patient.
GI/GU/FEN: He was kept NPO with NG tube to suction.
This was adequately replaced with IV fluids.
The patient was later decreasing his NG tube outputs to 4 liters by day 6 post-operatively.
TPN was started due to the elevated NG outputs (dark green bile).
POD#12, the patient decompensated with sudden onset chest and shoulder pain, shortness of breath, tachypnea, new oxygen requirement, EKG new right bundle branch block, and transient abdominal pain.
3 drains were placed.
Subsequently the patient developed multiple organ system failure, with acute renal failure requiring continuous venovenous hemodialysis.
Worsening refractory metabolic acidosis requiring multiple boluses and IV drip bicarbonate.
The patient developed sepsis as discussed above with multiple organisms (K. pneumonia, B. fragilis,...) The patient was placed on broad spectrum IV antibiotics.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and [**Last Name (un) **] dyne boots were used during this stay; he was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.
