He tolerated the procedure well and returned to the SICU in stable condition.
He required reintubation for hypercarbia but was easily extubated on post op day #1.
During his ICU stay he developed rapid atrial fibrillation and was started on Lopressor and amiodarone which eventually controlled his rate.
He was started on Vanco and Zosyn prophylactically but sputum culture grew only a sparse growth of GNR's.
He continued to progress daily and was started of cyclic tube feedings on [**2134-12-20**].
Unfortunately his blood sugars were not controlled and the [**Last Name (un) **] service was consulted to help with insulin recommendations as pre operatively he was managed with Metformin alone.
He was started on Lantus along with sliding scale regular insulin and with gradual adjustments came into better control.
Following transfer to the Surgical floor his nasogastric tube was removed and he had a barium swallow on post op day # 8 which revealed no leak.
His Amiodarone dose was increased to TID and anticoagulation was recommended with baby aspirin daily along with Coumadin as his [**Country **] score was 3.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was out of town but his office staff was very helpful in reviewing his past history as there was a question of a GI bleed on aspirin in [**2131**].
On [**2133-12-28**] his Amiodarone was decreased to 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 1 month then 200 mg daily.He also was diuresed with Lasix 20 mg daily with dramatic effect on his peripheral edema and therefore was discharged on lasix 20 mg daily for 3 days.
From a pulmonary standpoint he used his incentive spirometer effectively and his oxygen was gradually weaned off.
Both he and his wife were taught insulin administration as well as care of his feeding tube including flushing and starting and stopping feedings.
