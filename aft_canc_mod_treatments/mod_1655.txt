Infectious etiologies were also considered, including bacterial pneumonia, PCP (given that that the patient had been on chemotherapy), fungal infections, and tuberculosis.
Initially, the patient was treated with levofloxacin for community acquired pneumonia.
When the patient continued to be febrile, ceftriaxone and azithromycin were started for community acquired pneumonia, and coverage was then broadened to zosyn and vancomycin to cover nosocomial pneumonia as the patient's infiltrates on chest xray were worsening while the patient was hospitalized.
However, the PCP screen in patients with malignancy is not always reliable, so bactrim and steroids were started to cover PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient was also continued on isolation precautions for TB until additional sputum samples could be obtained, for similar reasons.
After PCP was ruled out steroids were d/ced.
Thoracic surgery was consulted for a VATS procedure to obtain tissue to help confirm the diagnosis.
The main concern, other than the above differential, was lymphangitic spread of his tumor, which could be confirmed with tissue, as well as BOOP, which was a concern given recent chemo therapy with tor-inhibitor, which has a known association with BOOP.
Thoracics recommended repeat Chest CT before considering VATS, and when this showed improvement in GGO they recommended continuing antibiotics and steroids and deferring VATS.
was stabilized and transferred back to the floor VATS was again considered given uncertainty in the diagnosis (repeat CTA had showed resolution of PEs, however pt.
was still very SOB, and the team was not confident that his SOB could be contributed to pulmonary edema and PE alone)  It was also noted that pt's decompensation happened after steroids were d/ced, and so a steroid responsive process like BOOP was considered.
improved with steroids and diuresis, and was discharged home with home O2 and close follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his oncologist.
was discharged on Prednisone, Lovenox and Coumadin, a BB and ACE, and home O2.
The second happened several days after Bactrim was tarted and was felt to be [**1-18**] AIN from Bactrim and resolved with discontinuation of this.
We continued aspirin and ACE inhibitor per his outpatient regimen, and added a beta blocker for better BP control.
#HTN -- We continued lisinopril, and doxazosin, which the patient was on as an outpatient, and added a beta blocker for better BP control, particularly given the patient's history of coronary artery disease.
He received 1 unit of PRBC on [**2-3**] and another on [**2-9**].
We continued with silvadene [**Hospital1 **] per outpatient regimen.
Celebrex was initially held due to elevated creatinine, but was restarted after a few days.
