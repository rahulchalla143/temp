The patient wears 2L NC at home at baseline.
On presentation to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the HCP decided that she believed the patient would not want to have aggressive care, including central line placement or pressors.
She agreed to continuing with IVF resuscitation and antibiotics.
Mot importantly, she wanted to keep the patient comfortable   Past Medical History: renal cell cancer L nephrectomy [**2081**] Hypertension Hypothyroid constipation dyslipidemia angina depression   Social History: No living family  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Vitals 97.0  150/80  73  18  99%3Lnc Pain: still grimacing to palpation of abdomen (before BM) Access: PIV Gen: lying in bed, mild resp distress, awake but not oriented or communicating HEENT: mm dry CV: RRR, no m appreciated Resp: CTAB, anterior crackles b/l, no wheezing, no accessory muscle use Abd; mild distended, +mild tenderness to palpation diffusely, no guarding, +BS Ext; no edema Neuro: unable to fully assess, awake, not communicating GU: foley with dark urine .
After discussion with HCP, it was decided not to escalate care with placement of central line or pressors, okay to continue supportive care with fluids, antibiotics and oxygen, and low threshold to shift goals of care to CMO.
She appeared to stabilize with improved BP and urine outpt and was transfered to Gen Med [**3-6**] for further management.
Blood cultures eventually grew out strep pneumonia and [**Month/Day (4) **] changed to ceftriaxone 1g q24 (PICC placed) for plan 2week treatment given bacteremia.
Severe Sepsis, strep PNA with bacteremia: WBC 30s, hypotension, hypoxic, lactic acidosis, ?ARF->severe sepsis, s/p approx 5L IVFs, now HDS.
s/p Vanc/Zosyn X3days, changed to ceftriaxone 1g q24 with plan for total 14day coruse, PICC placed today.
Goal per HCP is for supportive care with [**Name (NI) **] and fluids but no aggressive measures.
If pt appears dyspneic, give morphine, liberalize O2, overall goal for comfort precedes treatment.
CT w/o any acute abnormalities other than GB dilation w/o evidence of cholecysitis and fat containing inguinal hernia that doesnt appear incarcerated.
Cont aggressive bowel regimen with enema, laxatives, balance narcotics for pain control with worsening constipation .
s/p L nephrectomy [**2071**] so likely has some CKD.
Rising BUN and hypernatremia suggests  volume depletion but crackles on exam, on lasix as outpt, and BNP 15K, not sure if carries diagnosis of heart failure.
Given very low PO intake and clinically appears dry, will give 500cc more IVFs and hold lasix for a couple days.
On Morphine for pain symptoms, complicated by constipation despite aggressive bowel regimen Continue with pain regimen with morphine IR 15mg [**Hospital1 **], 5mg PO prn breakthrough and 1-2mg IV prn if not taking PO, bowel regimen with colace/senna/MOM/lactulose/enema.
Hypertension: Resume lisinopril and atenolol, hold lasix for a couple of days .
Pulm Edema: Unclear if has h/o heart failure (on lasix as outpt), CXR with pulm edema here and BNP 15K.
Resume lasix in a couple days or sooner if pt appears dyspneic or increased O2 requirements.
Hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine PO .
FEN/proph: HLIV, small fluid boluses prn hypotension, general diet when awake, TEDs, heparin, aggressive bowel regimen .
