She works in retail and has 6 grandchildren   Family History: noncontributory  Physical Exam: On admission: Vitals: 98.1 74 94/64 16 97 RA GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: soft, mildly tender to palpation in the LUQ, no hernias or masses, well-healed midline incision Ext: No LE edema, LE warm and well perfused   Pertinent Results: CXR [**3-1**]: new left-sided effusion with possible underlying atelectasis or airspace disease CT Abd/Pel [**3-1**]: enlarging complex ascites, hemorrhage without clear source of bleed; rapid progressive metastatic disease in pelvis, liver, splenectomy bed, stomach, mesentery, peritoneum CTA [**3-2**]: no active extravasation, loculated fluid, large complex masses in splenectomy bed, pelvis, omentum, peritoneum Abdominal XR [**3-4**]: no e/o obstruction, contrast in colon, pleural effusion CXR [**3-4**]: substantial L pleural effusion, compressive atelectasis, low lung volumes CXR [**3-5**]: no PTX, substantial decrease in L pleural effusion GIB study [**3-6**]: no evidence of active bleeding within the splenic resection bed CTA [**3-6**]: Acute pulmonary Emboli in RLL and RUL, new nodular opacity in R apex concerning for early PNA.
Extensive metastatic dz in abd, perihepatic ascites CXR [**3-7**]: PICC in place, L effusion returned CXR [**3-8**]: L effusion   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 6607**] is a 53yo woman with a history of metastatic uterine carcinosarcoma who was admitted from the emergency room to the ICU for hypotension secondary to hemorrhage into splenectomy bed lesion.
However after two family meetings, her daughter, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1169**] was named as her healthcare proxy and her code status was changed to comfort measures only on [**2136-3-8**].
It was decided that she would be receive a fentanyl patch daily and oxycodone as needed for breakthrough pain.
Her PICC line and foley catheter were left in place.
Her family received teaching about managing her indwelling catheter prior to discharge.
On hospital day 2, after receiving renal-protective bicarb infusion given her Cr 1.5, a CTA abdomen showed no active extravasation.
We therefore transfused her 2 more units of blood for a HCT of 25.7.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Given her creatinine of 1.5 on admission, she received renal-protective bicarb infusion prior to her CTA abdomen.
After her CTA abdomen, her creatinine increased from 1.1 to 1.8, and she was oliguric.
A FeNa was 0.3% consistent with pre-renal acute kidney injury, likely caused by a combination of IV contrast and anemia.
However, we stopped giving her boluses because there was concern that the fluids were adding to her left lung pleural effusion.
Urine output monitoring was stopped and her foley discontinued after her code status was changed.
She was maintained on nasal canula oxygen with acceptable oxygen saturations.
Given the inability to wean her from oxygen and dyspnea on exertion on hospital day 4, a repeat chest x-ray was performed which demonstrated a substantial L pleural effusion, compressive atelectasis, and low lung volumes.
Given her symptoms, interventional pulmonology was consulted.
On hospital day 5, she underwent an uncomplicated left thoracentesis by interventional pulmonology, with 300cc of fluid removed.
She continued to require oxygen and was continued on this for comfort.
# Pulmonary Embolism: Lovenox 80mg SC daily was started after diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
# Right apex pneumonia: Given the fact that Ms. [**Known lastname 6607**] was newly diagnosed with this while in house, it was treated as a hospital acquired infection with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime and levofloxacin.
She did have a PICC line placed because of her antibiotic requirement and for blood draws.
The antibiotics were discontinued per her code status.
# E. coli UTI: In the ICU, she was started on bactrim due to a urinalysis with positive nitrites.
She was then started on ceftriaxone for her urinary tract infection.
Her final blood cultures were negative and her ceftriaxone was discontinued on [**2136-3-7**]  # Metastatic uterine carcinosarcoma: In the emergency room a CT abdomen/pelvis demonstrated enlarging complex ascites, hemorrhage without a clear source of bleeding, and rapid progression of metastic disease in pelvis, liver, splenectomy bed, stomach, mesentery, and peritoneum compared to a CT scan performed a week prior.
Her code status was therefore changed to comfort measures only.
# Prophylaxis: Given her bleed risk, she did not receive subcutaneous heparin DVT prophylaxis.
She did have sequential compression devices and received intravenous pepcide for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
She also received an aggressive bowel regimen for constipation and this has continued for comfort measures.
