There are aortic calcifications and coronary artery calcifications.
The liver demonstrates a somewhat lobulated contour, which may be related to the patient's heart failure and hepatic congestion, though other forms of liver disease cannot be excluded and should be evaluated.
These lesions may represent areas of heparin injection in this inpatient, but clinical correlation is requested.

[**2114-4-16**] Cardiology ECHO [**2114-4-16**] Conclusions: 1.
She had missed a dose of zyprexa at [**Last Name (un) **].
She was given her Zyprexa and returned back to baseline.
After cardiology evaluation, the decision was made to perform balloon pericardiostomy to prevent reaccumulation.
Post procedure echos showed a minimal effusion, and she should continue to have serial echocardiograms weekly or every other week as an outpatient until follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who performed the procedure.
6) Atrial fibrillation - She is not on anticoagulation given her iron deficiency anemia with multiple potential GI sources, risk of bleeding into her pericardium, and fall risk.
She was continued on aspirin which has modest stroke prevention benefit and also metoprolol was titrated up for rate control as tolerated by blood pressure.
The cause was unclear, possibly due to total body volume overload, with R-sided CHF.
Her sodium level normalized with fluid restriction and lasix.
10) h/o glaucoma - She was continued on eye drops.
11) h/o hypothyroidism - She was continued on synthroid.
12) Skin - she was noted to have superficial excoriations on her sacral area and on her back.
