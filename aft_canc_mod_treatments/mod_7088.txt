Admission Date:  [**2109-6-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2109-7-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2047-12-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5547**] Chief Complaint: Dysphagia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Exploratory laparotomy, radical resection of liposarcoma en bloc including total gastrectomy and roux-en-y esophagojejunostomy, reimplantation of right common hepatic artery onto the celiac origin of the abdominal aorta, and partial resection of L hemidiaphragm with primary repair, L chest tube thoracostomy [**2109-6-27**] Bronchoalveolar lavage, [**2109-6-30**] PICC line placement, [**2109-7-7**] L chest pigtail placement, [**2109-7-11**] Exploratory laparotomy, attempted repair of aortoenteric fistula with attempt at primary repair and attempt at endovascular stent placement [**2109-7-12**]  History of Present Illness: 61-year-old female had previously undergone resection of a left retroperitoneal liposarcoma with an en bloc distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, left adrenalectomy, and left nephrectomy in [**2104-8-20**].
Initial workup, including an upper endoscopy and barium swallow, was unremarkable.
Patient received preoperative radiation therapy, which she tolerated well with improvement in her symptoms of dysphagia, although the mass appeared to increase slightly in size on cross-sectional imaging.
Given the lack of other effective treatments for a well-differentiated liposarcoma and the low likelihood of developing distant metastatic disease in the near term, she was offered an attempt at en bloc resection for local control, which she agreed to do.
Past Medical History: Liposarcoma s/p en bloc retroperitoneal mass resection (distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, L nephrectomy, L adrenalectomy) [**2103**] s/p tonsillectomy, ~40yrs ago L shoulder inflammation, tx'd with cortisone injection  Social History: The patient is married with two stepchildren and one other child.
She remained intubated with light pressor requirements that were weaned off by the first post-operative day, when she was successfully extubated.
She remained with a CVL, NJ tube, Chest tube, JP drain, and Foley catheter.
On POD 3, the chest tube was placed to water seal but a LLL collapse was noted on CXR, prompting a bronchoalveolar lavage for successful clearance of a mucus plug, which improved her respiratory status.
She was transferred to the floor on the following day, and the chest tube removed on the day after that.
Her pain control remained the PCA, with fentanyl patch added.
The NJ tube was removed and, on POD 6, an UGI demonstrated no anastamotic leak, permitting intiation of an oral diet with sips progressing to clears.
An operative exploration for repair of the enterotomy was offered to the patient, who declined, and local control of the leak was managed with the existing JP drain.
Antibiotic coverage consisted of Vanco, Cipro, Flagyl, coincident with a coag-negative staph UTI.
A PICC line was placed on POD 10 for administration of TPN as the patient's oral intake remained insufficient.
Thoracic surgery was consulted for the persistent pleural effusion, with concerns of possible feculent spillage, so a pigtail catheter was placed by interventional pulmonology on POD 14, finding clear serous fluid.
A few hours later, around noontime, another episode of hematochezia occurred, this time more significant, and she was intubated for profound hypotension.
She required more transfusions and crystalloid to maintain a sufficient blood pressure; a femoral arterial line and internal jugular central venous line were placed.
Because of her hemodynamic instability, it was decided to bring her to the operating room, in conjunction with discussion and consent from the family, with involvement of vascular surgery for question of arterioenteric fistula.
Given the dire situation, discussion was held with the family, and no further measures were to be attempted.
