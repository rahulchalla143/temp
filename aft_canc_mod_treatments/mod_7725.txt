Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements, heel to shin  Discharge exam: Pt is aaox3, PERRL, EOM intact, mild short term memory loss, Left hemineglect, motor is full   Pertinent Results: [**2134-6-25**]: CXR IMPRESSION: Widened right paratracheal stripe may represent a combination of vascular structures and mediastinal fat, although underlying lymphadenopathy cannot be excluded.
Status post ventricular catheter placement with the tip in the region of the septum pellucidum.
[**2134-7-5**] MRI Brain Wand study FINDINGS: The patient is status post right frontal ventriculostomy with the tip of the drainage catheter abutting the septum pellucidum.
Small extraaxial right parietal and temporal, but moderate bifrontal pneumocephalus, correlate clinically and repeat CT is recommended to monitor for tension pneumocephalus.
[**2134-7-5**] CXR FINDINGS: In the interval, the patient has received an endotracheal tube.
The patient has also received a nasogastric tube.
The course of the tube is unremarkable, the tip of the tube projects over the distal parts of the stomach.
[**2134-7-6**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and peroneal veins were obtained.
[**2134-7-6**] MRI brain with and without contrast IMPRESSION: Evidence of residual tumor at the medial and caudal margin of the resection cavity.
Unchanged position of extra-axial ventricular drain position.
No change in enlargement of the lateral and third ventricles following removal of the external ventricular drain.
Pt was admitted to the ICU for initial observation and placed on antiepileptic agents.
He was prepped for stereotactic brain biopsy.
On [**6-30**] he underwent the biopsy without difficulty and he tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the ICU for Q1 hour neurochecks and SBP control less than 140.
On the morning of [**7-1**] he underwent a fMRI with tractography to aid in planning for a potential resection of the lesion.
He underwent placement of a right frontal EVD in the OR on [**7-1**] for hydrocephalus by radiographic imaging.
CT head demostrated catheter placement within the right lateral ventricle without interim hemorrhage.
A pre-op work up and consent for surgery was done on [**7-4**].
On [**7-5**] he underwent Craniotomy for debulking of tumor.
He remained intubated until POD1 after a postop MRI could be done.
MRI demostrated subtotal resection as exoected witout stroke.
EVD was raised to 20 for attempted wean on [**7-7**] but patient became more lethargic and so the drain was dropped back down to 10.
He was scheduled for XRT planning on [**7-15**].He was seen by the physical therapy team and the plan was for a rehab facility to continue with mobilization and further care.
