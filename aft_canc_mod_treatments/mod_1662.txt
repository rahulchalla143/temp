A mid-cavitary gradient is identified (61 mmHg).
He received 6L NS IVF resuscitation and transferred to the unit for further management.
He was started on levaquin/flagyl to cover GI organisms and cover for ?
c.dif given a recent course of Levaquin for an enterococcal UTI.
Pt was continued on IVFs in the ICU, and briefly started on pressors to maintain his MAPs >65.
He was quickly weaned off pressors and transferred to the floor on [**7-18**].
On the floor, he was evaluated by GI who felt it was likely infectious vs ischemic and recommended adding cholestyramine +/- flex-sig if his diarrhea did not resolve.
A R SC line was urgently placed and patient received 1L IVF bolus which raised his BP to 110/68 prior to transfer to the ICU for further observation.
Of note, patient had received Lisinopril 5mg x1 and Metoprolol 12.5gm x1 that AM as well as Lasix 20mg IV x1 at 1440.
He otherwise was started on a heparin gtt for atrial fibrillation.
Pt appeared hypovolemic per exam likely from combination of diarrhea, aggressive diuresis and antihypertensive medications.
Placed CVL and given 2L NS resuscitation with improvement of BP to 110/68 prior to tx to ICU.
Antihypertensives were initially held and IVF resuscitation continued.
Once BPs were stable, lopressor 12.5 BIB was started for rate control as this was thought to be contributing to his hypotension.
The patient failed [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test so stress dose steroids were started and cont.
Pt with an extensive infectious workup, including (-) c.diff, O&P, and stool cultures.
was switched to flagyl PO for better c.diff coverage.
Ceftaz and Vanco were then started for better nosocomial gram (-), gram (+) coverage given recent hospitalizations.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Pt with known hx of atrial fibrillation in setting of prior dehydration and ?
pt started on anticoagulation on the floor but was held in ICU (pt with documented fall risk in prior d/c summaries).
ASA, statin were continued.
On morning of [**7-26**] the MICU team was alerted that the patient was becoming SOB with tachypnea into 40s and hypotensive.
At this time, BP responded to IVF boluses.
His hypotension was not responding to IVF and the patient was started on pressors again to maintain SBP>90.
After a long discussion, it was decided to make the patient CMO as he did not want to be intubated or resuscitated and he was quickly decompensating.
He was given Morphine IV for comfort and he expired on [**2165-7-26**] with his family present in the room.
