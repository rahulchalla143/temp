Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**12-1**] SVC venogram with initiation of TPA therapy [**12-2**] PICC line placed in IR [**12-2**] TPA cath check  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 1683**] is a 71-year-old man with adenocarcinoma of the rectum (diagnosed in [**6-/2131**]) who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by proctosigmoidectomy and a left lower lobe resection for pathologically confirmed lung metastases.
Following two cycles of FOLFOX chemotherapy, he underwent resection of a 1.7 cm solitary liver metastasis in [**2132-6-29**].
He then began further adjuvant therapy with 5FU/LV at 500 mg/m2.
Oxaliplatin was eliminated due to neuropathy.
He was admitted to OMED for prehydration and CTPA following discovery of non-occlusive thrombus around his port and finding of hypoxia with tachycardia in clinic on day of admission.
The plan had been to start lovenox with IR clot stripping.
He denies symptoms of CHF, including orthopnea, PND, lower extremity swelling.
Polyp: Adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.
Multiple low-attenuation lesions seen within the liver, the largest of which may represent cyst, smaller lesions are not fully characterized.
- [**2131-8-14**] to [**2131-9-25**]: Neoadjuvant chemoradiation with continuous 5-FU at 225 mg/m2/day and radiation therapy five days weekly.
- [**2131-12-10**]: Proctosigmoidectomy with stapled coloanal anastomosis and diverting loop ileostomy.
The resection margins were uninvolved.
- [**2132-2-13**]: Ileostomy takedown with simultaneous flexible bronchoscopy and VATS with left lower lobe resection.
It was felt that the lesion was amenable to surgical resection, and it was planned that the patient would undergo two cycles of chemotherapy prior to proceeding with hepatic resection.
- [**2132-4-9**]: FOLFOX chemotherapy initiated.
The patient completed two cycles of therapy on [**2132-6-3**].
- [**2132-10-22**]: Cycle 1 Day 1 5FU/LV for further adjuvant chemotherapy.
Oxaliplatin eliminated due to neuropathy.
New and enlarging lung nodules, worrisome for metastasis.
Venous angioplasty with balloon dilation with further improvement of the flow in the SVC.
PLAN: Heparin infusion to further declot the residue clots in the SVC and may switch to Coumadin in the near future to prevent the development of clots in the SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, this is a 71 year-old man with history of metastatic colon cancer s/p multiple surgeries, including proctosigmoidectomy, lung and liver resections, now on cycle 2 of 5 FU/LV presenting from clinic with hypoxia, tachycardia and dyspnea with mild exertion.
After prehydration, CTPA was done that showed SVC thrombosis with extension into the right and left brachiocephalic veins.
Patient was started on heparin drip.
IR was then consulted and planned for intravenous thrombolysis to break-up clot.
On [**12-1**], patient underwent local thrombolytic tx to the SVC clot and was transferred to the ICU for overnight monitoring.
He is discharged on Lovenox injections 1 mg/kg [**Hospital1 **], which he will likely need to continue for 6 months.
There is concern of HIT given that he was on heparin throughout hospitalization, although his platelet count is still high at 117 (and there were several fluctuations in platelet levels from day to day).
If his platelet count continues to fall, he may need readmission and bridging to coumadin with DTI like argatroban.
METASTATIC COLORECTAL ADENOCARCINOMA On cycle 2 of 5FU/LV; further plan for chemotherapy is per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
HYPERTENSION We continued his outpatient beta-blocker while hospitalized.
ACEI was held for concern of worsening renal failure in setting of multiple contrast loads for CTPA and intravenous thrombolysis.
He required 12 units of glargine HS and was placed on humalog sliding scale.
Hemoglobin A1c came back at 7.7.
I spoke with him regarding follow-up with his primary physcian and told him there are medications that could help with blood sugar control.
Heparin drip was given for SVC thrombus with switch to Lovenox at discharge.
