Status post Whipple with serpiginous hypodensity seen in the left lobe most consistent with retraction injury.
Additional Pathologic Findings:  Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia -- highest grade: PanIN:  III; chronic pancreatitis.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2108-4-4**] for Whipple procedure, necessitating right hepatic artery reconstruction with gonadal vein for which the vascular surgery service was consulted intraoperatively.
She received 6 u pRBC, 2 FFP, and 500 of albumin in the OR, and was left intubated on pressors, and taken to the surgical ICU post operatively.
In brief: she required frequent blood transfusions of pRBCs, FFP, and albumin, with a persistent pressor requirement; she developed acute renal failure requiring CVVH, had persistent elevations of LFTs, had a persistent leukocytosis and in total the cardiology, infectious disease, renal, and hepatology services were consulted.
Given down-trending platelets, HIT panel was sent and returned positive on POD5, and the patient was begun on a bivalirudin drip per hematology recommendations.
On POD8 a left brachial vein clot was found on non-invasives and she was initiated on fondaparinux, subsequently discontinued.
On POD11 the patient was noted to have QTC prolongation, for which the cardiology service was consulted, and recommendations were followed regarding medication adjustments.
She was found to have SBP, and begun on meropenem in consultation with the hepatology and ID services.
Lactulose was initiated given poor mental status (AOx1 initially), on which she seemed to initially improve.
On POD20 the patient failed a speech and swallow evaluation, and continued on tube feedings.
