He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on the [**Hospital Ward Name **] between [**3-22**] - [**4-13**] for a massive GIB, DVT, and cholecystitis.
He received a total of 10 U pRBC and 10 U FFP while in the MICU.
He was restarted on coumadin before discharge.
He underwent cipro, flagyl, and unasyn and then underwent an ERCP in which a stone was removed from the biliary tree, a sphincterotomy was performed, and the CBD was noted to be dilated to 12 mm.
PNA: he was treated for PNA with ceftriaxone and azirhtomycin via PICC on discharge to finish the course on [**4-19**].
He was discharged to a NH on [**4-13**] with a PICC in place for abx.
He was transfused 1 unit of PRBC on [**4-18**] to which his HCT did not respond (know to be very difficult crossmatch).
He was continued with an infusion of TPA overnight that was infused through a catheter extending the length of the clot and then was taken back to the IR suite on [**4-20**] and imaging showed that the clot had broken up a little.
Influenza A--> "coma" for 21 days ([**2100**]) Pt admitted to [**Hospital1 **] for respiratory distress.
Incidentally was diagnosed with Anemia and manocytosis so got Bone Marrow Biopsy.
HTN: well controlled with Tiazadone 8.
Essential thrombocythemia: normally on antiplatlet agents, held in anticipation of surgery   Social History: 1-2 packs per day for > 50 years (began whe he was 9 and just stopped 9 months ago).
#) DVT s/p thrombolysis: Required thrombolysis since his clot burden was rising above the filter in the IVC.
The patient was taken off of coumadin and started on lovenox with the thought that this might be slightly better at preventing further extension of clot.
For now he will continue on lovenox, aspirin, anagrelide and hydrea.
Lovenox levels should be checked periodically by measuring Factor Xa levels (therapeutic is between 0.6 and 1.0).
O2 sats to high 80s when sleeping on 2 L NC and increased to 4 L NC in the setting of SOB and satting in high 90s.
He was intubated for IR procedure on [**4-25**] and TEE, and after extubation required facemask ventilation.
His breathing seemed to improve with diuresis (was given 20IV lasix daily for approx a week) and he required less oxygen.
Lasix was held but volume status needs to be repeatedly evaluated with further diuresing as needed.
He did not aspirate on a formal speech and swallow eval, but given these episodes were intermittent he was placed on a thickened liquid diet (soft solid) diet with aspiration precautions.
#) UTI: UA [**4-27**] w/ mod bacteria, pt has dysuria, started Cipro for 7 day course (last dose 4/19) and pyridium for dysuria, considered FC change but deferred given possibility of not being able to replace because of edema.
#) Scrotal swelling: likely from poor venous and lymphatic drainage in legs from extensive DVT's.
The patient seemed to have substantial pain with this which was treated with judicious use of lidocaine jelly, miconazole powder, and elevation as possible.
Oxycontin and breakthrough oxycodone were also used.
The scrotal swelling did gradually improve but will still require aggressive management of pain.
#) chest pain: occurred transiently in the setting of pt lying on his stomach during an interventional radiology procedure.
Likely skin contaminant, but d/c'ed PICC from R arm anyway since it was present when the positive blood cultures were drawn.
ID was consulted and recommended Vanco for 2 weeks s/p removal of R PICC (last dose will be [**5-7**]).
#) PNA: Pt had this diagnosis during last admission: completed azithro and cetriaxone to complete 10 days per ID recs (finished on [**4-22**]).
He was started on zosyn and should complete a 7 day course (finish [**5-9**]).
He requires intermittent transfusions.
Recently had severe GIB which required an SMA angiogram which showed bleeding at the distal ileocolic branches, which underwent successful embolization.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] d/c'd epopoetin for now but restarted hydrea and anagrelide.
Were holding aspirin and anagrelide while awaiting cholecystectomy, but now seems like this is not going to happen.
Aspirin was to reduce clotting of plts that are present, and this was restarted after his last IR procedure.
#) HTN: - continued metoprolol and diltiazem.
#) Gout: allopurinol 100 mg daily .
