Brief Hospital Course: This is a 54-year-old right-handed man with a h/o recurrent GBM, s/p resection, XRT, chemotherapy.
His treatment is complicated by pulmonary embolism, seizure, and steroid myopathy resulting in frequent falls who presented to clinic on [**2194-2-5**] with increased somnulence, weakness, and episodes of syncope.
Given these profound lab abnormalities, he was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring, where Na and K were repleted and he clinically improved; he was then transferred to the Oncology floor for further management.
He was restarted on Decadron with further improvement of his energy level and return to his baseline mental status (awake and oriented x 2).
He was also started on Ritalin which also decreased his somnulence.
This condition resolved with aggressive repletion.
His Lasix and Zaroxylyn were held and were NOT restarted at discharge.
This condition resolved with holding of his diuretics and IVF hydration.
(4) History of Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's INR was elevated on admission (likely due to poor PO intake causing alteration of gut flora), therefore his Coumadin was held until [**2194-2-9**] when her was restarted on his prior regimen (5 mg 4x/week and 4 mg 3x/week).
The patient was continued on temozolamide and decadron.
He was maintained on fall precautions.
