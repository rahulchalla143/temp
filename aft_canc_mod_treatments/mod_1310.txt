Pulmonary angiography, s/p bilateral bronchial artery embolization 3.
Right hip long stem bipolar hemiarthroplasty 4.
Curretage right proximal and distal femur lesions  History of Present Illness: 66 yo M with history of thyroid ca metastatic to lungs bilaterally and to brain and bone, presents to the ED after presenting to OSH with hemoptysis.
A surgical resection demonstrated a papillary carcinoma.
He subsequently received radioactive iodine therapy for this disease and appeared to have tolerated it well.
His treatment was complicated by atrial fibrillation, and was placed on atenolol.
He subsequently required repetition of his radioactive iodine treatments because of elevated thyroglobulin levels as well as because of the appearance of new lung metastases.
He was started on coumadin in [**1-28**] for a PE and in the summer of [**2159**], the patient had two episodes of hemoptysis during exertion, which required a bronchoscopic evaluation and ablation of the lesion.
He was subsequently admitted with hemoptysis and underwent a bronchoscopic evaluation and control of his bleeding.
A Thyrogen scan did not reveal Iodine uptake.
He was admitted to the MICU for further work-up and management after rigid bronchoscopy.
Tip of ET tube not visualized.
Bronchial artery embolization was performed bilaterally.
PET [**11-28**]: IMPRESSION: Diffuse abnormal FDG uptake in the lungs and bone consistent with metastatic disease, which compared to prior exam shows slight increase in disease burden.
Bilateral bronchial artery embolization was performed without complication, and he was extubated several hours after the procedure.
Of note, as an outpatient he was on lovenox at treatment doses for a PE that he had in [**1-28**].
Bilateral bronchial artery embolization was performed without complication, and he was extubated several hours after the procedure.
Post-procedure, he was hemodynamically stable except for an episode of difficult to control Afib with [**Month/Day/Year 5509**] (max rate 200's) thought to be precipitated by beta-blocker withdrawal that converted with esmolol gtt, digoxin, and reinstitution of metoprolol.
As his hematocrit remained stable and he was without further episodes of hemoptysis x 48 hours, he was transferred to OMED for consideration of chemotherapy.
Before transfer he did spike a fever to 101 and was pan-cultured but no antibiotics were started.
Of note, he required no blood product transfusions this admission.
On the floor, the patient began again to have small volume hemoptysis (dark blood mixed with sputum per report) and was noted to be hypoxic to 76-77% on 4L NC which improved to the 90% on NRB.
He was starting sorafenib therapy rather than chemotherapy (tumor is iodine neg) as of [**11-28**]; he had two doses of the medicine, the last of which was taken around [**2160-1-8**].
# Atrial Fibrillation: Mr. [**Known lastname 20598**] has a history of AFib and was on atenolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for rate control (as well as BP control).
Atenolol was held upon admission for relative hypotension in teh setting of hemoptysis.
His HR improved to the 130 - 140 BPM range with 25 mg IV of lopressor and 20 mg IV of diltiazem; atenolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] was then restarted.
HR remained in the 140-150s range and esmolol gtt was started.
The pt was also started on a po digoxin load and spontaneously broke out of afib in NSR in the 70s.
Atenolol was also switched to metoprolol to allow better in house titration of his HR.
When transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he had a number of additional episodes of atrial fibrillation with [**Hospital Unit Name 5509**] which were controlled with IV diltiazem or IV metoprolol.
Early in his [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission he actually had to be intubated given his unstable hemodynamics; we attempted electrical cardioversion on [**1-21**], but this was only very briefly successful.
We continued to use digoxin and metoprolol but we were initially concerned about the possibility of using amiodarone because of its iodine content.
Ultimately after much discussion with endocrine and oncology, we judged use of the amiodarone to be worth the potential cost (namely, decreasing the possibility of radioactive iodine, a treatment which had already failed him).
As we loaded him on amiodarone we ultimately discontinued the digoxin, without any further significant episodes while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Metoprolol was discontinued because of some intermittent hypotension.
Anticoagulation was not started because of his hemoptysis.
# h/o PE: The pt was on lovenox as an out-patient, which was held on admission in the setting of the bleed.
The risk vs. benefits of restarting the pt on lovenox will need to be determined.
# Cytopenia: Patient with anemia (baseline Hct 30) and thrombocytopenia, possibly from bone marrow supression from malignancy and chemo.
Currently on gabapentin, fentanyl patch and dilaudid PRN.
Hypotension: pt had multiple episodes of hypotension during his [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay requiring fluid bolus, though has been stable x 72 hours.
In the latter part of his [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay his pressure was stable, and he had not required further fluid bolus.
Patient was taken to the OR on [**2160-2-4**] for R hip long stem bipolar hemiarthroplasty, tolerated the procedure well without complications.
