He was started on a 14-day course of unasyn & doxycycline but was ultimately discharged on augmentin.
He did not, however, complete a 14-day course; opting to stop antibiotics on [**4-18**] in hopes of being considered for a clinical trial.
Subsequent to his penultimate admission, he was screened for a clinical trial for a novel anti-PDL1 antibody that required him to hold his tarceva for 3 weeks.
He was started on 5L oxygen via FM and his oxygen subsequently rose to 97%.
he was given 1 L NS but his BP persisted in the 80s/40s.
As such, IP was called and a thoracentesis was performed.

Brief Hospital Course: REASON FOR ICU ADMISSION:  45 M with metastatic RCC s/p multiple chemo regimens p/w fevers, cough, SOB, hypotension as well as abdominal pain with diarrhea x 2-3 days.
He was seen by interventional pulmonology, with no recommendation for bronchoscopic treatment given distal nature of obstruction.
He was also treated with small volume thoracentesis in the ED.
Given recent hospitalization and antibiotic administration there was c/f C.Diff and he was started on IV flagyl and PO vancomycin.
He was treated with flagyl, and cefepime was moved to Levofloxacin, for presumed infectious colitis.
He is now s/p multiple rounds of chemotherapy with progression of disease.
