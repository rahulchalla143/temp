Within the abdomen, there is diffuse bowel wall thickening involving the entire colon with pericolonic fat stranding.
No focal fluid collection is identified though evaluation is somewhat limited due to lack of intravenous contrast.
The gallbladder is mildly distended and there is suggestion of mild prominence of the CBD (601B:20), though again evaluation is limited in the lack of intravenous contrast.
Given distribution and clinical findings, findings are consistent with infectious colitis, less likely inflammatory.
There is diffuse transmural wall thickening, mucosal enhancement and wall stratification after administration of intravenous contrast.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 30689**] is a 55 year old male with human immunodeficinecy virus (HIV) (CD4 224, viral load 277 [**1-/2104**]), Hepatitis C (VL 1,350,000 IU/mL [**11/2103**]), and gastric lymphoma that was diagnosed 8 years ago who presented with nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, episodes of bright red blood per rectum, and increased confusion; he was found to have Shigella enteritis with bacteremia, as well as acute kidney injury, hyponatremia, anion gap acidosis and transient hpoxia.
Patient has documented history of being noncompliant with his medications and indeed his CD4 was down to 121 with an elevated viral load to about 4,000 copies.
Shigella enteritis could also account for the bloody stools.
The patient was treated empirically with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole to cover broadly for bowel flora, but this was tailored to ciprofloxacin alone after Shigella was isolated.
MRI pelvis confirmed absence of other rectal pathology, such as rectal abscess or fistula formation as a result of flexiseal presence.
He was treated with ciprofloxacin, initially IV then PO.
# GIB: BRBPR on presentation was most likely a consequence of Shigella enteritis.
This was accompanied by a drop in hematocrit that required blood transfusion while in the ICU.
Improved with IV fluids and increased PO intake to 0.7 at the time of discharge.
# Hypoxia:  The patient was desatting in the ED to the low 80s and was started on Bactrim.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] Bactrim was stopped upon transfer to the ICU.
His home Truvada and Viarmune were continued.
