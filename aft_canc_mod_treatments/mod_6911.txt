Brief Hospital Course: An 82 year old lady with multiple medical problems recently discharged for PNA presents with 3 days of diarrhea accompanied by tachycardia & fever with concern for new left pneumonia despite levaquin therapy.
She was started on vancomycin/zosyn 2 week course, albuterol and ipratropium neb treatments and supplemental oxygen.
IV fluids were administered for her acute on chronic CKD (see below) which may have lead to some pulmonary edema.
Lasix was held in the setting of her ATN thus some fluid overload may be present, and prior to discharge she was slowly restarted on lasix for diuresis.
Prior to discharge a repeat chest xray showed a stable left-sided pleural effusion, new small right sided pleural effusion (thought to be secondary to holding lasix for hypotension for over a week), and stable retrocardiac opacity.
The patient was discharged on 2.5-3L of oxygen, with saturdations 90-93%.
It was unclear if this was a [**Name (NI) 4522**] flare of small bleed from anticoagulation (on heparin at the time) or thrombocytopenia.
She was started on pulse dose steroids and tapered down to prednisone 60mg daily.
The patient's daughter and HCT did not feel her mother could tolerate a procedure at this time and opted for medical management.
She will continue her prednisone taper while at rehabilitation.
Given she has been on steroids for many years, calcium and vitamin D therapy was initiated during this hospitalization.
Her lasix and metoprolol were held on admission for hypotension and renal failure.
Lasix was restarted prior to discharge for diuresis and improve her respiratory status.
Metoprolol should be restarted when appropriate, given she is on a prednisone taper.
Prior to discharge a transthoracic echo was performed so that it can be used for comparison in the future.
Witholding lasix and gentle diuresis, the patient's renal function improved.
Her medications were renally dosed and nephrotoxins avoided where possible.
5) Crohn's Disease: Initially the patient was continued on prednisone 18mg daily as per her home regimen.
However with hypotension and respiratory failure, she was started on stress dose regimen which was eventually tapered.
She was switched from IV to po prednisone and is currently on a long taper.
She will continue on prednisone, mesalamine and cipro twice daily to prevent a flare.
6) MDS and Related Anemia: The patient is known to have chronic anemia secondary to both MDS and CKD.
She is followed as an outpatient by hematology and received weekly Epogen treatment prior to her multiple admission.
In the setting of acute renal failure she was switched to heparin for approximately 2 days at which point her thrombocytopenia became significantly worse (plt 49 at lowest).
Given her risk of bleeding (anemia, thrombocytopenia) it was felt the risk of anticoagulation was greater than the benefit, despite her underlying PE/DVT history.
The issue of anticoagulation should be readdressed once her more pressing issues, namely intermittent bloody stools and thrombocytopenia are resolved.
Lovenox was not restarted prior to discharge.
Of note, a thyroid cyst was identified on this study, which it appears has been seen on prior imaging but should be further evaluated if concerns arise in the future.
Both wound care consult and vascular surgery were asked to comment and felt surgical intervention or debridement were not warranted, but good wound care and close monitoring should be instituted.
The patients legs were wrapped daily, adaptec applied to wounds, and lotion applied to decrease the risk of further skin tears.
9) GERD: In the setting of guaiac positive stools she was switched from omeprazole to protonix IV for two days while concern for active bleed was ruled out.
Once stable, she was restarted on omeprazole 20mg twice daily.
10) Osteoporosis: Calcium and vitamin D were continued during admission.
Her diet was switched to lactose free and high calorie supplements were provided.
