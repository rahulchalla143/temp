Brief Hospital Course: 82 yo man with a complicated PMH including Afib on coumadin, prior strokes, vasculopathy (s/p right CEA, CABG, AAA), malignancy (prostate cancer s/p resection and XRT, cholangiocarcinoma s/p biliary stent with possible metastatic disease, as well as colonic mass path pending), hypothyroidism, now off coumadin since [**2-27**] after a recent GIB with a Hct of 20 in the setting of significantly supratherapeutic INR ~8, who presents today with 5 discrete episodes of a non-fluent aphasia with reported return to baseline between events.
He proceded to have a cluster of at least five of these within a few hours, which were all stereotyped, and so after speaking to his [**Hospital3 **] Gastroenterologist who felt that his bloody bowel mvts were most likely related to hemorrhoids rather then the hepatic flexure polyp, we decided that the risk-benefit ration was in favor of anticoagulation for these presumed TIAs in the context of his vasculopathy to prevent stroke and so we started him on a Heparin drip with goal INR 50-70.
He developed fluid overload and was transferred to the cardiology floor for diuresis prior to GI surgery, which was acheived with IV lasix.
On [**3-19**] he went to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy, right colectomy, open cholecystectomy and his care was transferred to the general surgical service.
He was continued on flagyl for a +Cdiff on [**3-14**] for a total of 2 weeks.
He was fluid resuscitated for hypotension and low urine outbut and was continued on lopressor IV for heart rate control.
He was continued as NPO with IV fluids.
He was maintained on CPAP+PS and diuresis was started with lasix.
On POD 4 ([**3-23**]) he was started on TPN while awaiting the return of bowel function and later in the evening he was extubated.
He was started on tube feeds via an NGT on POD 6 ([**3-25**]) and the TPN was discontinued.
Diuresis was continued as tolerated with intermittent lasix and later a continuous lasix IV drip.
On POD 10 he continued to be unable to wean from the ventilator with failed spontaneous breathing trials.
He tolerated the procedure well and was started on tube feeds via the PEG on [**4-1**].
Cardiology again saw the patient for occasional episodes of SVT and the patient was continued on lopressor and diuresis as tolerated.
His ventilatory settings were weaned down and he was able to tolerate trach collar on [**4-1**] for a short time.
Diuresis was continued with a lasix drip.
He was found to be Cdiff positive again on [**4-5**] and was started on flagyl and oral vancomycin.
On [**4-8**] he tolerated trach collar x 24 hours with no vent rest and the lasix drip was discontinued.
He continued to auto-diurese and was continued on intermittent lasix IV BID and later TID.
