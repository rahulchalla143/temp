Brief Hospital Course: Summary & Formulation on Presentation, [**2196-7-28**]: 40 yoM with HIV, metastatic lung CA with brain metastases, s/p first whole brain radiation treatment, now with nausea, vomiting, headache, confusion, amnesia, and a syncopal episode prior to admission.
# Headache/nausea/vomiting/confusion/amnesia/syncope - After an extensive work-up including multiple CT-scans of the head with and without contrast, MRI of the head with contrast, EEG x 3, and LP x 2 - both of which revealed elevated ICP and were palliative for the patient's headache, and the first of which grew out negative cultures and demonstrated malignant cells - neurology diagnosed the patient's constellation of symptoms to be caused by progressive metastatic leptomeningeal lung metastases in the setting of whole-brain XRT-associated cerebral edema; seizure and stroke were ruled out.
During the hospitalization, the patient was started and continued on anti-seizure medication, titrating Keppra up to 1250mg twice daily.
Dexamethasone was also started and continued to treat cerebral edema in the setting of ongoing whole brain radiation.
The patient is being discharged on these medications to a rehab facility with hospice.
Following this episode, after which the patient recovered some function, the patient's cognitive function precipitously and progressively declined, presumably due to the natural history of leptomeningeal metastatic lung cancer and due to superimposed cerebral edema caused by what was at the time ongoing daily whole brain radiation as well as superimposed hyponatremia secondary to SIADH, itself caused potentially by pain or some other unclear etiology.
# Leptomeningeal metastatic lung cancer: The patient received 13 out of 15 daily scheduled whole brain radiation treatments in conjunction with daily dexamethasone for cerebral edema.
He tolerated the treatments reasonably well.
# Transient unresponsiveness - On [**2196-8-14**] the patient was found unresponsive on the floor and was intubated for airway protection and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
In the ICU, the patient received neuro checks q2hrs and his anti-sz medications, including Keppra and steroids, were given by iv.
He was administered hypertonic saline and PO salt tabs.
For DVT prophylaxis the patient was maintained on pneumoboots and famotidine for GI ppx.
# Hyponatremia - Analysis of serum and urine osmolality in the setting of euovolemia pointed to a diagnosis of SIADH.
The patient's hyponatremia was managed conservatively in collaboration with the consulting Nephrology team with fluid restriction titrated to 2L daily and salt tabs titrated to 2 gm PO every 6h.
The patient required no supplemental oxygen.
# HIV/AIDS- We Continued home HIV meds and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]; CD4 count on admission was 84 and 46 on discharge.
Patient had thrush detected on [**8-2**] and was treated by nystatin swish and swallow.
# Bacteremia - The patient had gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters growing in his blood early in the hospitalization; it most likely was a contaminant because of only one positive culture and no signs of clinical infection, Vancomycin was started and discontinued on [**8-2**].
# C.Dif - The patient developed loose stool over the course of the hospitalization, was placed on contact precautions and started empirically on oral flagyl, which was subsequently discontinued after cultures were negative for C.Dif.

You were brought to the hospital because of a chronic severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and memory loss after you had started whole brain radiation treatment for known metastatic lung cancer in your brain.
You were started on medications to prevent seizure and reduce the brain swelling normally caused by whole brain radiation.
Your symptoms improved on these medications as well as analgesics and they improved further after the neurology physicians drained fluid from around your brain on two occasions.
We continued the radiation to your brain at the hospital to treat the tumors and you tolerated these procedures well; we also continued your anti-seizure and anti-swelling medications and started you on a salt tablet and fluid restrictions to maintain normal electrolyte levels, which are important to brain function.
As we have already discussed with your family, we are unable to provide further treatments that may reverse the progression of your brain metastases and we anticipate that your mental functioning will continue to decline.
