It started at 5pm and went away with SL nitro at home.
EMS gave ASA 325mg, morphine 4mg, and another SL nitro.
CT surgery felt emergent bypass was not possible.
He was admitted to the CCU, started on nitro gtt and lasix.
Not anticoagulated given his thrombocytopenia and hx of HIT.
Episode of chest pain leading to first [**Hospital1 2025**] admission was also preceded by chemotherapy that day.
Labs and imaging significant for lactate 4.1, trop 0.65, glu 381 with gap 13, UA with trace ketones and large glucose, calcium 10.9, WBC 2.5, Hct 30.8, Plt 92, and INR 1.4.
In the ER, the patient still c/o of CP after additional SL nitro.
Chest pain finally resolved with nitro gtt.

EKGs: 2-3mm ST depressions in V3-V6 on admission; these decreased to ~1mm ST depressions on discharge when patient was asymptomatic  Brief Hospital Course: 76M with extensive hx of CAD including multiple CABG with most recent cath on [**9-23**] c/b rotorblade impaction in the LCx presents to ED with chest pain, elevated troponin, and EKG changes.
The chest pain appears to be associated with the timing of his chemotherapy for multiple myeloma.
# Chest Pain: Suspect demand ischemia secondary to chemotherapy agents (direct effect or volume induced pulmonary edema).
Based on literature review, cardiac effects commonly seen with Revlimid/Velcade, and given his EF 45%, some aspect of overload could also contribute to this problem.
This resolved with Lasix, nitro drip, beta blocker, and morphine.
Nitro gtt was weaned later the day of admission, and he was placed on Imdur 30mg/day (in place of home isosorbide dinitrate).
Pt was continued on ASA 81, but Plavix was held given thrombocytopenia (PLT in 50s).
We continued his home BB (Metop tartrate 50 [**Hospital1 **], which was eventually switched to metop succinate XL 100mg daily), [**Last Name (un) **] (Valsartan 20 daily), and statin (pravastatin 80mg, increased from home dose of 40mg daily).
We spoke with oncology, and they recommended holding chemotherapy in case it is implicated in the patient's demand ischemia.
The oncologist may need to adjust the chemotherapy regimen to avoid further cardiac issues.
On the first morning of his admission, he had what appeared to be an episode of flash pulmonary edema, which resolved with metoprolol, nitro drip, morphine, and Lasix.
Pt was started on PO Lasix 40/day prior to discharge.
Pt received Revlimid/Velcade/dex for MM (cycle 2, day 1 [**2163-10-13**]).
The patient will meet with his oncologist on the day following discharge to discuss the potential impact of his chemotherapy on his cardiac disease and whether there are alternative agents.
# DM2: Patient was on high doses of home insulin with blood sugar in 300s and glucose in his urine.
TRANSITIONAL - Will need to avoid prior chemotherapy regimen (he has appointment with Dr.[**Name (NI) 7517**] the day following discharge) - Will need to follow his blood sugar control with outpatient PCP and home [**Name9 (PRE) 269**] - Will send d/c summary to cardiologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 79852**] at [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 745**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 20468**] (he has an appointment with him in early [**Month (only) 359**]) - Patient is confirmed DNI/DNR  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
