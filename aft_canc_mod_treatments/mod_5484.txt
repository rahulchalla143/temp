Preoperative staging suggested a T2 N0 lesion and given his good performance status he was recommended for primary resection with a decision regarding adjuvant therapy based on true pathologic stage.
Invasive CA of GE junction, Barrett's esoph s/p remote fundoplication (20 yrs ago @[**Hospital1 **]) 2.
Esophageal tissue pathology: [**2110-8-20**] DIAGNOSIS: A.  Distal esophagus (A-C): 1.
Three chest tubes in the right hemithorax are identified and one chest tube on the left is identified.
A jejunostomy drain is in place.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are visualized status post esophagectomy and gastric pull-up.
ERCP [**2110-9-17**]: ERCP: Two spot fluoroscopic images were obtained during endoscopy for guidance of procedure without a radiologist present and was subsequently sent for review.
The images demonstrate endoscope within the region of the esophagus with a stent in the upper portion of the esophagus.
Per endoscopy report, the stent was removed with a new stent placed successfully.
IMPRESSION: Per endoscopy report, a previously placed stent in the upper third of the esophagus was removed and was replaced by a new esophageal stent successfully.
Slight decrease in amount of periesophageal stranding with interval replacement of esophageal stent which contains debris distally.
Remaining right- sided chest tube tip is retracted when compared to prior examination.
Persistent peripancreatic inflammatory changes with identification of known leak/small fluid collection and tract anteriorly where the surgical drain now terminates.

Fluconazole SENSITIVE BY [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **]   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2110-8-5**] and underwent attempted transhiatal esophagectomy with conversion to Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **] transthoracic esophagectomy and a feeding jejunostomy.
He tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the SICU intubed.
Neurological:  Pain control was initially achieved with an epidural and dilaudid PCA.
Cardiovascular:  He went into rapid a-fib and was placed on a diltiazem drip in the ICU, which converted him to sinus rhythmn.
He was later switched to IV Lopressor which provided adequate rate control.
In the ICU his hypotension was managed with fluid boluses rather than vasopressors.
Pulmonary:  On [**2110-8-20**] he underwent a right thoracotomy, right decortication, and drainage of right chest empyema.
On [**2110-8-21**] he underwent an exploratory thoracotomy for evacuation of a hemothorax and control of bleeding.
Gastrointestinal:  A JP drain was left to drain the abdomen just superior to the pancreas.
Tube feeds were started on POD #4 and advanced to goal rate.
On POD #15 ([**2110-8-20**]) he was taken to the OR for an esophagogastric leak where he underwent an anastomotic revision.
On [**2110-8-21**] during an exploratory thoracotomy, an intercostal muscle flap reinforcement of the esophagogastric anastomosis was performed.
On [**2110-9-8**] an EGD showed a chest tube in the esophageal lumen, which was pulled back and an ERCP was performed on the same date and a pancreatic stent was unable to be placed due to papilla edema.
On [**2110-9-10**] an esophageal stent was placed via EGD and a pancreatic duct stent was placed via ERCP.
On [**2110-9-16**] the esophageal stent was removed via EGD.
On [**2110-9-17**] a new esophageal stent was placed via EGD.
On POD #57 he passed a bedside swallowing test and was started on clear liquids.
On [**2110-10-17**] the esophageal stent was removed via EGD.
On [**2110-10-22**] the esophageal stent was replaced and the pancreatic stent was replaced.
Hematologic:  He was started on SQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
He was transfused 3 units of PRBCs on [**8-5**] for his initial operation and 2 units of FFP on [**2110-8-7**].
He received 3 units of PRBCs and 4 units of FFP on [**2110-8-20**].
Infectious Disease:  An ID consult was obtained and he was placed on an antibiotic regimen of Vancomycin, Cipro, and Fluconazole for the anastomotic leak and MRSA and non-fermenting gram-negative rods isolated on pleural fluid culture.
On [**2110-9-13**] he developed a [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the Cipro was discontinued and Meropenem was added.
On [**2110-9-15**] vancomycin was stopped and Daptomycin was started to cover enterococcus and MRSA; the meropenem was continued to cover GNR's in pleural fluid.
On [**2110-9-30**] fluconazole was discontinued and Caspofungin was started.
The course of antibiotics was completed on [**2110-10-10**].
Infectious disease was reconsulted and recommended restarting Daptomycin until cultures return.
The PICC line was changed and the tip culture revealed no growth.
Infectious disease recommended changing Daptomycin, Meropenum to Unasyn 3gms and starting Diflucan 200 mg once through [**2110-10-31**] for a three week course.
Infectious disease recommended to continue present course of antibiotics and follow cultures.
Disposition: He continued to work with physical therapy and was transferred to [**Hospital1 700**].
