Standard position of the ET tube and NG tube .
Low position of the endotracheal tube with its tip just above the carina.
Evaluation for metastatic disease limited due to lack of intravenous contrast.
Brief Hospital Course: 89F with COPD, HTN, DM, with mediatinal mass s/p intubation on arrival for airway protection and s/p extubation on [**2191-11-22**] and reintubation for excessive secretions on [**2191-11-24**].
Patient with normal TFTs, Thyroglobulin 1170.
Followup appointments were scheduled in near future to discuss plan of care: surgical resection vs. observation.
# Respiratory Failure: Initially intubated for airway protection given stridor.
She was also on a prednisone taper for COPD (last dose 11/8).
She intermittently tolerated trach collar but was largely vent dependent with PS 10/5 FiO2 0.50 especially when lying flat.
# DVT from LUEx PICC and right CVL IJ: treated with heparin gtt until platelets fell.
Then changed to argatroban given concerns of HIT.
We restarted heparin gtt and coumadin on [**11-28**].
Plan: bridge with heparin and continue with coumadin until INR [**2-26**].
We monitored her for several days after coumadin given and saw no allx reaction.
Monitor INR closely - Please pull right IJ CVL when heparin gtt no longer needed since it has a clot alongside it.
# Thrombocytopenia: in the setting of heparin and vanc, and improving since Vanc has been discontinued.
Patient started on Argatroban empirically, although HIT Ab returned negative; resend HIT was also negative.
Also received fluconazole for tracheitis and vanco for MRSA PNA (8d).
Then had recurrent sputum pos for MRSA PNA so started on linezolid on [**11-27**].
She intermittently was in afib with RVR requiring dilt gtt and increasing doses of dilt PO.
BP tolerates and her HR improves.
We gave lasix 20 IV.
At home she takes lasix 80 daily.
