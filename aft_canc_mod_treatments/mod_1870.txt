[**2174-3-9**] CXR AP - IMPRESSION: Relatively stable x-ray examination given differences in depth of inspiration and technique.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
Bilateral renal cysts, not fully evaluated given lack of IV contrast.
[**2174-3-17**] PICC line placement - ADDENDUM: On review of this study in conjunction with the frontal and lateral chest radiographs, the right PICC is identified terminating in the lower SVC or cavo-atrial junction.
Per recommendations from the infectious disease team, the patient was empirically treated with nafcillin for 6 days and then switched to a combined regimen of ciprofloxacin, cefepime, and flagyl starting the evening of [**3-15**] when his surveillance blood culture from the day prior grew gram negative rods in the anerobic culture bottle (eventually grew B. fragilis).
The patient also required aggressive IV fluid resuscitation on presentation to support his blood pressure and intermittantly required pressors as well.
The patient was started on amiodarone and metoprolol and cardioversion was planned as it was felt that he was likely not a candidate for coumadin given his recent GI bleed and colon cancer.
He then spontaneously converted to NSR after correction with D50, sodium bicarbonate and insulin.
Metoprolol was discontinued due to hypotension and the patient was continued on low dose amiodarone per EP recommendations.
Metoprolol was unsuccessful and the patient was reloaded with IV amiodarone and spontaneously converted back into NSR.
He has COPD at baseline and had recently been treated for a COPD exacerbation and was on a prolonged steroid taper.
Subsequently, he had difficulty weaning from the ventilator, initially due to fluid retention in the setting of agressive IV fluid hydration required to support his blood pressure (he was 17L positive over his length of stay), as well as underlying COPD.
They recommended phosphate binders to treat the patient's hyperphosphatemia and also considered performing renal biopsy, but deferred when the family decided not to persue any further interventions on [**3-18**] and declined dialysis.
All medications were renally dosed during the patient's stay.
On presentation he was initially given colchicine and prednisone was increased to 40 mg for presumed gout attack.
Colchicine was stopped due to worsening renal failure.
He was transfused with 1 unit of PRBCs on [**3-13**] units on [**3-14**], and 1 unit on [**3-21**].
# Thrombocytopenia: The patient did have a decrease in his platelets which may have been multifactorial, including HIT, uremia and DIC.
Local wound care, frequent turns, special mattress, and close monitoring for areas of peripheral necrosis were performed.
He was placed on an insulin sliding scale which was stopped on [**3-21**] as he was no longer taking steroids and was not tolerating tube feeds at goal.
# Glaucoma: Eye drops were continued per home regimen.
However, as the patient continued to do poorly despite antibiotic therapy and additional support, the family eventually decided not to persue further agressive therapy and provide comfort measures only.
