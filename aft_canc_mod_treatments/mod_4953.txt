Admission Date:  [**2198-5-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-6-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2128-11-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14255**] Chief Complaint: Acute Renal Failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2198-6-1**] Diagnostic Paracentesis [**2198-6-21**] EGD: feeding tube placement, duodenal polyp biopsy [**2198-6-22**] EGD: duodenal stalk identified as source of melena, endoclip placed  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 69yo F with history of schistosomiasis cirrhosis c/b diuretic refractory ascites, portal hypertension and encephalopathy currently on transplant list, IDDM, HTN and HLD who was directly admitted from home by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], outpatient Hepatologist for acute renal failure.
ROS: per HPI, denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 69yo F with history of schistosomiasis cirrhosis c/b diuretic refractory ascites, portal hypertension and encephalopathy currently on transplant list, IDDM, HTN and HLD who was directly admitted from home for acute renal failure.
Patient received albumin 1g/kg (62.5grams) on HD 1 and morning after creatinine improved to 1.7.
On HD 2 H/H was low so instead of albumin patient was volume challenged with 1 unit PRBCs and 25grams of albumin (1 unit PRBCs=25 grams albumin).
Diagnostic paracentesis ruled out SBP.
Creatinine worsened after initial volume challenge and did not respond to second round of 1g/kg albumin.
After failed improvement diagnosis of hepatorenal synrome was made and midodrine/octreotide were started and uptitrated without improvement in creatinine.
Initially, plan was for pt to have HD line placed in IR and start dialysis.
# Cirrhosis: Chronic, related to schistosomiasis complicated by diuretic refractory ascites, chronic renal failure, portal hypertension, thrombocytopenia, prior SBP and encephalopathy.
Continued Rifaximin 550mg PO BID and Lactulose TID for HE prophylaxis.
Continued Ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis.
No GI endoscopy in our system but patient being evaluated for transplant, cannot be on transplant list without endoscopy so presumably completed somewhere.
Attempted to diurese with Lasix 20 iv then 80, put out very small amt of urine, incontinent.
Plan was made for dialysis as above.
This was likely [**2-15**] mild oral trauma in the setting of coagulopathy--INR 3.6, platelets 75.
Per discussion with ENT and OMFS, attempted to stop the bleed with afrin soaked gauze, topical thrombin, silver nitrate, aminocaproic acid.
Also transfused with platelets, FFP, and RBCs (as hct was 22 down from 25 at last check).
Tamponaded bleed for ~10 minutes, but again continued to have uncontrollable bleed and was transferred to SICU on the transplant surgery service for elective intubation and packing.
Albumin and PRBCs given for intravascular volume and patient kept on 1.5L fluid restricted diet.
# Acute anemia: Patient with chronic anemia related to cirrhosis though with acute drop on HD 2.
Unknown if patient has varices without endoscopy in our system and is not on beta-blocker so presumably none on prior endoscopy.
# DM: Insulin Dependent, Type II.
Continued Glargine 12 units qHS and HISS  # HLD: Chronic, stable, continue zetia  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Continue holding diuretics - Recommend tracking down endoscopy report, unknown where completed  ICU Course ([**2198-6-22**] to [**2198-6-28**], date of death) Ms [**Known lastname 89252**] was transferred to the surgical ICU the morning of [**2198-6-22**] after developing worsening melena.
She had an EGD the day prior for the purpose of Dobhoff feeding tube placement, and during that EGD a duodenal polyp was noted and biopsied.
Of note, she had an INR of 2.5 and fibrinogen of 59 prior to the procedure so snare removal of the polyp was deferred.
The first few days in the SICU she remained HD stable, but continued to have melena with an unstable hematocrit.
She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics (vanc/zosyn/mica) and a CT torso showed severe pneumonia with very little residual aerated lung volume.
She became hypotensive despite increasing her pressor doses.
She was not responding hemodynamically to significant product transfusion, and her ventilator settings were increased with more oxygen needed.
She was transitioned to comfort care at 7pm, though the endotracheal tube was left in to prevent aspirating blood which we felt would cause her too much discomfort.
She was started on a morphine drip.
