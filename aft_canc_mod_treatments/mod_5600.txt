Tylenol [**1-12**] p.o.
Loxapine 25 mg p.o.
Risperdal 1 mg p.o.
ALLERGIES:  Prolixin, Stelazine, Flonase, Ativan, Dimetapp, Trilafon, lithium, aspirin, Persantine, Relafen, ranitidine, Prilosec, Procardia, strawberries, Sudafed, tofu.

Low anterior resection of the rectosigmoid.
Excision of cul-de-sac and completion hysterectomy with partial vaginectomy.
The patient was initially treated with fluid restriction with gradual improvement of her sodium.
It remained within the 125 to 135 range and oscillated with treatment with intravenous fluids and p.o.
The patient had her urine sodium and osmolality checked on multiple occasions and her urine sodium was usually low and urine osmolalities were usually high.
Shortness of breath:  The patient was intermittently treated with oxygen via nasal cannula and maintained oxygen saturations greater than 92% during her hospital course.
The patient was seen by the CT surgery service and eventually had a video-assisted thoracoscopic procedure with drainage of a right hydropneumothorax, pleurodesis, pulmonary biopsy and two chest tubes that were placed.
The procedure was uncomplicated.
The patient had good resolution of her shortness of breath secondary to drainage of the fluid.
She was initially treated with a five-day course of azithromycin (patient has a history of prolonged QT and we did not want to use levofloxacin).
The patient had multiple sputum Gram stains which were possibly contaminated with oral flora and which did not grow out any specific pathogens.
However, given the development of right hydropneumothorax it is possible that the patient redeveloped consolidation of the right lower lobe and thus she was treated with intravenous Zosyn for a full seven-day course.
The patient was treated with supportive blood transfusions and was kept on strict bedrest for this.
She received a total of eight units of packed red blood cells for the fall in her hematocrit.
The patient subsequently did not need blood after [**2102-3-16**] and the surgery service signed off.
Bipolar disorder:  The patient was continued on her home dose of loxapine and Risperdal with no complications.
However, subsequent blood cultures remained negative that were drawn from the Port-a-Cath and the patient was treated with intravenous vancomycin.
The patient was started on Flagyl 500 mg p.o.
Acute renal failure:  The patient had a stable creatinine throughout her hospital course however subsequent to her video-assisted thoracoscopic procedure and subsequent to being n.p.o.
As the patient was intravascularly volume depleted the patient was treated with intravenous fluid hydration and eventually her creatinine improved to 1.0 which is her baseline.
If pulmonary biopsy result returned as ovarian carcinoma plans for outpatient chemotherapy with carboplatin would be initiated.
The patient was deconditioned at the time of discharge and will need physical therapy for rehabilitation.
