T4 bilateral laminotomy, medial facetectomy.
T5 bilateral laminectomy for removal of extradural     lesion.
T6, T7, T8 bilateral laminectomy, medial facetectomy,     foraminotomy for extradural mass.
History of Present Illness: 68 yo M w/ HTN, DM, CAD s/p CABG, and recently dx metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, unknown primary possibly lung, w/ mets to spine, s/p cycle 6 of carboplatinum, taxol (last [**3-13**]) presented cord compression at T6 on MRI spine s/p T5-8 laminectomy, transferred to MICU for hypotension and fever.
He was taken to the OR for laminectomy of T5-8, medial facetectomy, foraminotomy for extradural mass on [**4-29**].
He received total 2.5L IVFs, and was started on vanc and ceftaz.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

[**5-7**] SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST: The endotracheal tube ends at the level of thoracic inlet, approximately 7.5 cm above the carina.
Endotracheal tube ends at the level of thoracic inlet.
Recommend further evaluation with chest CT. .
The tip of the endotracheal tube is at the level of the thoracic inlet, unchanged from prior.
Endotracheal tube at thoracic inlet, unchanged.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service and taken to the Operating Room for the above procedure without complication.
Intravenous antibiotics were continued for 24hrs postoperatively per standard protocol.
The patient's pain was controlled with IV pain medications followed by oral analgesics once tolerating POs.
The foley was removed on POD2.
He was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring given his metastatic CA history and started on empiric IV antibiotics.
He was stable in the ICU and improved with IVF and transferred out to the floor.
Pain control became an issue, particularly left shoulder pain.
He required enough short-acting pain morphine to warrant starting MS Contin, which was uptitrated.
He ultimately was given Narcan for his somnolence.
He woke immediately, but began to complain of chest tightness.
As stated above, he was immediately intubated upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and continued on broad antibiotics.
He remained on mechanical ventilation.
It was then noticed that his endotracheal tube appeared high.
He was given two 1L NS fluid boluses without change in his hemodynamics.
Transient hypotension was initially attributed to the use of Propofol for sedation (subsequently changed to Fentanyl/Midazolam) and perhaps large amounts of pain medication that were slow to clear secondary to impaired liver and renal function.
He was started on peripheral dopamine for pressure support.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Thought likely secondary to Contrast Nephropathy based on timing and urine electrolytes.
He also underwent a T5-8 laminectomy for suspected cord compression secondary to a spinal met on [**4-29**].
He suffered tremendous pain from his extensive disease, which was controlled with Fentanyl boluses in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
# Coronary Artery Disease: EKGs obtained were consistent with prior and showed no evidence of acute ischemia.
He was ruled out for myocardial infarction with two negative sets of cardiac biomarkers.
# Diabetes Mellitus: On oral anti-hyperglycemics at home, which were held.
Fingersticks were checked q6h and insulin provided as needed.
