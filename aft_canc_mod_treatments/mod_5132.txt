She had been on long course of antibiotics since [**7-15**].
Stools were C.diff positive and patient was started back on course of PO vancomycin.

An abdominal CT showed findings consistent with colitis, and your stools were positive for C.diff, so you were started on oral Vancomycin for treatment, with a plan to continue this medication for at least 6 months after discharge.

Bronchoalveloar Lavage was done on [**2158-10-24**], which showed evidence of Pneumocystis pneumonia, so you were started on treatment with Bactrim.
An EEG was done which showed continued sharp spikes, consistent with an encephalopathy, and the neuro-oncologists believed that you had continued underlying seizures, so you were started on Lamictal with a plan to uptitrate this dose.
You were also started on Seroquel nightly.
These medications greatly improved your mental status.
You should continue to take your medications as prescribed below.
