If clinically feasible, consider PA and lateral views for further evaluation.
There is an indwelling Foley catheter balloon within the thick-walled bladder.
The findings are highly suggestive of carcinoma pf the sigmoid colon with a possible contained inflammatory component extending to and possibly locally invading the dome of the bladder.
Degenerative changes are noted diffusely throughout the thoracolumbar spine with multilevel bridging osteophytes are seen in the mid thoracic spine.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 87M with long and complicated past medical history admitted from the ED with new onset confusion, hypotension, and fever.
HYPOTENSION/SEPTIC SHOCK: He presented with SBP to 70s systolic, fevers, and eventually mounted a leukocytosis to 22.7 in the setting of a lactate greater than 5.
A central venous line was placed in the ED.
He was started on vanco/zosyn to cover potential bowel pathogens, with a translocation event suspected in light of abdominal pain on exam.
He briefly required pressor support with aggressive fluids with normalization of his blood pressure.
On [**5-25**] the patient was transferred to the surgical service and taken to the operating room where a sigmoid colectomy and reduction of type IV hiatal hernia was performed.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the TSICU for further management.
