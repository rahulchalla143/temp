Brief Hospital Course: 60M CLL, CNS lymphoma diagnosed in [**2122-11-26**] status post multiple treatments now with progressive disease and increasing seizure frequency.
Seizures:  Patient was initially admitted for seizure management and was given lorazepam as needed to terminate seizures.
Following rituxan and high-dose AraC therapy, patient began to experience twitching of his left lower extremity, which he and his family thought were the prodromal effects of seizures.
Following two EEGs, it was determined that patient was not in fact in status, and that sedative medications should be minimized.
Dilantin was titrated to a serum level of 19-20, and Lamictal was continued and no further seizures were noted.
CNS lymphoma:  Patient was initially treated with rituxan and high-dose AraC for the synergy.
Cerebral edema was managed with standing dexamethasone with intermittent increases as needed.
However, despite treatment and lack of change on repeat MRI, patient's mental status began to worsen.
Further chemotherapy was felt to be futile.
In preparation, patient underwent endoscopic placement of a jejunostomy tube for continued PO medications (especially anti-epileptics).
