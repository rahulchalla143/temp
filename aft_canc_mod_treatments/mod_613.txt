The patient had recently been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus three months ago and started on insulin.
There was also concern for a possible biliary obstruction given the elevated alkaline phosphatase of 1,818 and total bilirubin of 12.4 and so the procedure was also for the purpose of decompression.
On the day after admission, the patient had received 2 units of packed red blood cells and had a CT of the abdomen which revealed a 3.2 cm mass in the head of the pancreas with clear fat planes between the mass and all surrounding abdominal organs with vascular structures intact with the exception of the mass which abutted and possibly invaded the duodenum.
The patient had episodic desaturations to the low 70s to 80s which improved to 90s with supplemental oxygen.
The patient received a trial of IV Lasix and concern for ongoing clinical deterioration led to the consideration for ICU level care.
The patient had been started on ceftriaxone and Flagyl for antibiotic coverage.
Infectious Disease was consulted and recommended that the patient undergo treatment with Zosyn 2.25 grams IV q. eight hours.
The patient's hematocrit was noted to continue to be low and he was given 3 units of packed red blood cells along with vitamin K 10 mg subcutaneously for an elevated INR.
Renal was consulted for further evaluation of the patient's acute renal failure and it was felt that the patient's acute renal failure was secondary to acute interstitial nephritis in the setting of treatment with Zosyn.
The Zosyn was discontinued and the patient underwent supportive care with avoidance of nephrotoxins and discontinuation of the patient's angiotensin receptor blocker.
The patient was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics.
There was inability to place this biliary stent on the first attempt.
The patient returned to the ERCP Suite on [**2178-5-11**] and sphincterotomy was performed with a coated walled stent placed in the distal common bile duct.
Surgery was consulted for a possible Whipple procedure; however, given the patient's current clinical status at this time, no surgical intervention was needed at the time.
The patient was followed by Renal who recommended the use of diuretics for volume control.
He transiently required pressors consisting of Levophed but this was eventually able to be weaned off.
The patient's volume was able to be controlled with intravenous diuretics.
The patient required an insulin drip for glycemic control which was worse in the setting of infection.
The patient underwent diuresis to try to decrease the amount of FI02 that he was requiring.
The Renal Service recommended a short steroid course of prednisone to treat the patient's acute interstitial nephritis.
He was started on vancomycin for treatment of this.
Given the possible presence of a drug reaction and some decreased urine output and difficulty controlling the patient's volume, the patient was diuresed with ethacrynic acid with good response.
The patient developed hematuria for which Urology consult was obtained and this was thought to be secondary to ethacrynic acid which is associated with gross hematuria and the patient was diuresed further with Lasix in place of ethacrynic acid.
The patient developed a contraction alkalosis for which he received Diamox with a good improvement.
The patient underwent weaning from the ventilator and his sedation was changed from Ativan to propofol in the hope of achieving sustained extubation.
He remained with a relatively high oxygen requirement post extubation.
He continued treatment for MRSA pneumonia with vancomycin for a total course of ten days.
He developed oral lesions shortly after extubation which were thought to be secondary to HSV.
Humalog/Humulin sliding scale 17 units in the a.m., 8 units at h.s.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was an 84-year-old male with a pancreatic mass status post ERCP and stenting for biliary obstruction with a complicated ICU course significant for respiratory failure and acute renal failure.
PULMONARY:  The patient underwent extubation on [**2178-6-4**] and had ongoing difficulties with secretions and aspiration.
He was initially able to be weaned to 4 liters of nasal cannula.
He completed a ten day course of vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia.
He continued to have aggressive pulmonary toilet and continued to do well from a respiratory standpoint.
He completed a short course of steroids which were tapered and continued to make adequate urine output over the course of his admission.
The patient had some hypertension after extubation and was initially started on Lopressor.
The use of beta blocker will be helpful in limiting ventricular ectopy.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient was maintained on a regular insulin sliding scale and fingerstick blood sugar monitoring for his diabetes mellitus.
After extubation, he did not require an insulin drip and was able to be maintained with subcutaneous insulin.
Discussion was held with the patient and his family including his son, [**Name (NI) **], and wife and he elected not to consider surgery for his pancreatic malignancy.
It was stressed that based on the CT abdominal findings of his recent examination that the tumor may be resectable and Surgery confirmed this.
Gastroenterology was consulted because of the patient's intolerance of tube feeds after extubation.
alimentation and underwent a video swallow examination which showed that he could tolerate thin liquids with a chin tuck and ground solids.
If the patient is not able to nourish himself orally, a permanent enteric feeding tube would need to be considered versus chronic total parenteral nutrition.
Multiple attempts were made to pass a NG tube in the postpyloric position and were met with difficulty suggesting the possibility of the pancreatic mass limiting the ability to achieve a postpyloric tube even through interventional radiology.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient initially received tube feeds while intubated and then after extubation was not able to tolerate even 10 cc an hour.
The patient also had his course complicated by hypernatremia which was treated with free water boluses initially and then IV D5W.
PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was maintained on subcutaneous heparin, Venodyne boots, and a proton pump inhibitor.
ACCESS:  The patient has a left PICC line in place.
The patient should be discharged on 4 liters of supplemental oxygen nasal cannula.
