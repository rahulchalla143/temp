Rectal adenocarcinoma; status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy - status post abdominoperineal resection on [**2192-4-5**].
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 56-year-old female with a history of rectal adenocarcinoma who had undergone a course of chemotherapy and radiation therapy who presented for elective abdominoperineal resection on [**2192-4-5**].
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2192-4-5**] and on that same day underwent an abdominoperineal resection by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].
She remained intubated and was taken to the Postanesthesia Care Unit postoperatively, where it was noted she was in significant metabolic acidosis.
Given her history of heart disease, and the fact that it had been trending down, she was given several transfusions of packed red blood cells.
It was felt that given the perioperative period, beta blockade would be suitable for blood pressure control and rate control; for which she was started on Lopressor which she tolerated well.
The patient remained intubated until postoperative day three.
From a gastrointestinal perspective, on postoperative day four, the patient was started on clear liquids and subsequently advanced on days five and six to the point where she was on a general diet on postoperative day six, which she was tolerating.
Otherwise, we attempted to remove all nephrotoxic drugs and gently hydrated her.
In total, the patient had received 4 units of packed red blood cells during her postoperative course.
At one point, a heparin-induced thrombocytopenia panel was checked.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Overall, she was given physical therapy each day which she tolerated, but it was felt that she would benefit from rehabilitation.
Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously q.8h.
Albumin/ipratropium inhaler.
Lasix 30 mg by mouth twice per day.
Percocet (for pain).
Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  Note also to the rehabilitation facility to watch the patient's potassium as she may need some repletion given her potassium as she continues to diurese.
