Although nondistention of large bowel past the sigmoid may represent physiolgic process, peritoneal spread of tumor or nondistention from chronic inflammation, with obstruction at this level cannot be entirely excluded.
CXR [**2166-1-26**]: There is a new right IJ line with tip in SVC.
The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.
The NG tube tip is in the stomach.
Brief Hospital Course: 79F with locally advanced pancreatic CA on Xeloda and oxaliplatin (C2D1 [**2166-1-8**]) admitted with diarrhea.
After cdiff was negative x 1, she was given symptomatic treatment of her diarrhea with loperamide.
She continued to have nausea and profuse diarrhea, and she was given tincture of opium as well as octreotide.
She was emergently transferred to the ICU, where NG tube was placed with immediate output of almost a liter of feculent material.
She was put on broad spectrum antibiotics and central line was placed for aggressive fluid repletion.
She was intubated for airway protection given concern for aspiration pneumonia.
Surgery was consulted and did not feel that the patient was a candidate for surgical intervention.
Patient remained intubated and on pressors for several days.
Antibiotics were selected to cover possible bowel pathogens given concern that she could have had microperforations or perhaps SBP given new finding of ascites on imaging.
Her daughters (and health care proxy) agreed that the patient would not wish to continue aggressive care given her poor prognosis.
Cr quickly improved with IV fluids and support of MAPs.
Chemotherapy was held and patient's family agreed upon comfort care after discussing the matter with her oncologists, the ICU team, and palliative care.
Patient's INR improved with FFP and vitamin K.  #.
