Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: =================================== 63M with ALS, HIV on HAART with undetectable VL (per pt), hepatitis C (written in records, antibody positive, reported by primary care physician as not having hepatitis), recent diagnosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma admitted to [**Hospital 2725**] Hospital  and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] following presumed episode of ventricular tachycardia.
Regardless, the patient had anterior EKG changes and an elevated Troponin indicating myocardial infarction likely in the LAD territory versus myocarditis.
We empirically heparinized him given concern for coronary ischemic prior to his cardiac catheterization, but this was discontinued.
We maintained him on Aspirin 325 mg PO daily.
We also considered placement of an ICD given his inferior or inferolateral hypokinesis and presumed V.tach event, but this must be weighed against life expectancy given his esophageal adenocarcinoma and progressive ALS diagnosis.
Held antibiotics on admission.
We did start utilizing his PEG tube this admission and speech and swallow evaluation noted the need for thin liquids and soft-moist consistency diet given his risk of aspiration.
Although he intermittently remained alert and oriented to time, place and location, his wife noted that this is not atypical for him during prior hospitalizations.
She notes that in the past he has needed benzodiazepines and other sedating medications.
