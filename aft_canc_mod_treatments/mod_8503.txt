HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2158**], insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who had a recent colonoscopy in [**2165-5-30**] with three polypectomies who had been doing well post procedure and presented to the Emergency Department on [**7-16**] with black stools times 10 to 12 days and increasing fatigue.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2158**], status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2158**].
Colonic polyps status post polypectomy times three in mid [**2165-5-30**].
Lasix 20.
Allopurinol 300 daily.
Lipitor 10.
Plavix 75.
He was placed on intravenous proton pump inhibitor and aspirin and Plavix were held.
The patient continued to require transfusions off and on throughout his hospital course.
He bled intermittently with melanotic to maroon liquid stools with clots requiring up to five units of blood within one 24 hour period.
The patient continued to bleed after the colonoscopy and the patient continued to receive multiple units of blood in order to keep his hematocrit above 30.
He was found to have a significant amount of protein in the urine based on the SSA study.
The patient was started on therapy for his multiple myeloma.
He also received five treatments of plasmapheresis in order to decrease the load of light chains in the serum.
This was found to be secondary to myeloma kidney and overwhelming light chain protein load on the patient's kidneys.
He was started on hemodialysis and was seen by the Renal consult team.
He required hemodialysis on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and his kidneys did not respond to therapy for the myeloma nor did they respond to the hemodialysis because patient continued to have virtually no urine output throughout his hospital stay.
This was found to be secondary to the plasmapheresis and the patient was treated with subcu and oral vitamin K.  He was given fresh frozen plasma and the last two sessions of plasmapheresis were followed by fresh frozen plasma transfusions.
He was taken off all heparin products including heparin flushes and heparin with dialysis.
Heparin antibody was ordered.
He was transfused with platelets twice while bleeding.
The decreased platelets were felt to be secondary to nutrition, uremic platelets and bone marrow infiltration.
