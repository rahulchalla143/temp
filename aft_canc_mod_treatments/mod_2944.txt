Bilateral thyroid nodules, when feasible,U/S recommended.
However, the patient has recently been intubated and these findings could be due to that procedure.
Brief Hospital Course: 52 year old male with hyponatremia, possible aspiration on CT, intubated for airway protection.
patient was initially given hypertonic saline for short interval.
He subsequently corrected himself rapidly ([**1-17**] requiring large volumes NS due to hypotension); concern was raised for central pontine myelinolysis.
Sodium was monitored closely and fluid restriction was discontinued.
He likely has greater than 4L free water requirement and should be allowed to drink to thirst only instituting fluid restriction if Na<130.
It was likely that his hypotension was [**1-17**] both volume depletion, sepsis, and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
He was started on levofloxacin and flagyl to cover for aspiration pneumonia which was switched to vanco/zosyn as below.
As his blood pressure improved with IVF beta blockers were started to prolong filling time and improve his cardiac output from his HOCM.
# Airway protection - patient intubated, was weaned and extubated after prolonged wake up phase but was not able to adequately clear copious secretions and was reintubated.
Treatment for VAP was started with Vanco and Zosyn.
# Altered mental status: difficulty to wean of sedation with intermittent unresponsiveness.
He was restarted on all home medications with good effect.
# Pnuemonia: Mr [**Known lastname **] was treated for aspiration pneumonia on admission with levofloxacin and flagyl; he later developed fevers refarctory to this and was changed to vancomycin and zosyn for empiric VAP.
# hypertension: later in Mr. [**Known lastname **] course he developed severe hypertension in the 200/110 range and was started on a labetalol drip which was eventually weaned and he was changed to a regimen of amlodipine 100po tid + captopril 25 tid + amlodipine 10.
EP was consulted who felt that he was a candidate for ICD placement in light of his HOCM, however other medical issues including renal mass as above needed to be evaluated prior to any intervention, and that he can follow up in their outpatient clinic.
