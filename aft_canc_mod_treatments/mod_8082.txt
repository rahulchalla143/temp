The patient is a 63 year old woman with h/o stage I lung cancer, GERD, HTN, thromboembolic disease, ex-smoker, admitted for worsening dyspnea in background of traceobronchomalacia.
The patient underwent removal of Y-stent and placement of a new longer stent reaching up into cervical trachea.
However, the patient remained symptomatic with paroxysms of acute wheezing/stridor despite stenting of cervical trachea, making her a poor candidate for surgical intervention as the cause of these paroxysms are less likely to be associated with tracheobronchomalacia in the absence of improvement with stent placement.
She was started on mucomyst therapy, continued albuterol, ipratropium, mucinex, hypertonic saline nebulizer treatments, and BiPAP, and was able subsequently to tolerate the stent with no subsequent episodes concerning for mucous plugging.
ENT was consulted for evaluation of potential vocal cord dysfunction as etiology of symptoms, and found no evidence to support this diagnosis.
# Hyperglycemia - The patient has diabetes, managed with glyburide at home, and was maintained on an insulin sliding scale during this hospitalization.
# GERD - The patient was continued on her home omeprazole, simethicone, and TUMS.
Her regimen was enhanced with [**Hospital1 **] PPI and addition of H2 blocker given risk of increased reflux with tracheal stent.
# Depression - The patient was treated with her home citalopram.
