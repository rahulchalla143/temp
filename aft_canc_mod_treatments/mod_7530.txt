Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 yo woman with ovarian cancer transferred from the surgical service for febrile neutropenia in the setting of bowel perforation secondary to a duodenal ulcer.
She was not a surgical candidate, so a drain was placed into the intra-abdominal abscess adjacent to the duodenal perforation with the initial plan to keep the drain in place x 6wks.
She was also started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for peritonitis and TPN while left NPO.
Oncology consultation recommended starting G-CSF for developing chemo-induced neutropenia and transfer to the Oncology service.
Cultures from the abscess drainage grew coag-negative Staph, Enterococcus, and yeast.
ID was consulted and antibiotics eventually narrowed to cipro/metronidazole/vancomycin in addition to fluconazole.
A PPD with Candidal Ag control were placed and a quantiferon gold assay was indeterminate.
She required a short (two day) stay in the ICU [**Date range (1) 42061**] for worsening hypoxemia despite furosemide the same day after placement of a G-J tube for tube feeding.
She was treatd with further diuresis and lower extremity doppler U/S was negative.
Her subsequent course was notable for copious, frequent stools in the setting of increasing her tube feeds to their target volume that improved somewhat when the tube feed rate was decreased.
Nutrition was consulted and tube feedings were changed.
Repeat C. difficile toxin assays and PCR were negative and she was treated supportively with banana flakes in her tube feeds and loperamide.
Current regimen is ciprofloxacin PO, metronidazole PO, IV vancomycin, and fluconazole PO per ID.
Work up for recurrent fevers ~ [**2166-4-21**] ultimately revealed that her J tube had migrated.
In the last week of her hospitalization, abscess drainage had markedly decreased.
Interventional radiology was consulted and a pleurex catheter was placed [**2166-4-29**].
She was not a surgical candidate, so CT-guided drain into abscess was placed [**2166-3-31**].
It is not clear how long abscess drain will need to stay in place and will be dependent on follow-up abdominal/pelvic CT post discharge.
The persistent LUL infiltrate on CXR may be a malignant process given that it has not resolved on broad spectrum antibiotics and pulmonary workup has been negative for infection although a tissue diagnosis has not been pursued.
No surgical intervention at this time.
TPN was converted to tube feeds after G-j tube was placed [**2166-4-11**] for feeding and for perforated ulcer bypass.
After D/W surgery and GYN ONC, fistulogram/sinugram to eval for site of perforation, which showed that J tube tip had migrated to site of perforation.
Sinugram also showed that perforation at mid duodenum-resection would require a Whipple's procedure which pt would not tolerate.
She will have a repeat CT 10 days after discharge and be seen in surgical follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2028**] (GYN ONC) for consideration of further management.
Thoracentesis [**2166-4-7**] drained 1.3L from left side, complicated by small pneumothorax now resolved.
The etiology of worsening hypoxemia requiring a brief 2 day [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission [**Date range (1) 90111**] was likely  multifactorial: LUL infiltrate, recent PEs, atelectasis, splinting from right abdominal pain s/p J tube placement, recurrent malignant pleural effusions.
# Ovarian cancer: s/p cycle 1 carboplatin/paclitaxel [**2166-3-26**], but held on additional chemo until ulcer/perforation was healing.
Treatment for malignant effusions would be chemotherapy, but this was on hold due to her bowel perforation.
The patient underwent pleurex catheter placement by interventional pulmonary service on [**2166-4-29**] for recurrent malignant pleural effusion.
Treated with elevation and intermittant diuresis.
# Thrush: Nystatin swish and spit temporarily given in addition to the fluconazole.
# PE: Enoxaparin has been held as necessary for procedures and then restarted when procedures are completed.
# FEN: Sips and tube feeds.
Enoxaparin for PE treatment.
# Pain (abdominal pain): Hydromorphone IV prn for most of hospitalization, switched to oxycodone per J tube prior to discharge.

Chemotherapy induced neutropenia (low white blood cells).
Left Upper Lobe Infiltrate that has not cleared with antibiotics suspicious for malignancy.
H. pylori infection.
An abdominal abscess formed from the perforation and needed a drain placed to help clear the infection along with IV antibiotics and G-CSF (Neupogen), a medication to help produce white blood cells, as your white blood cell count was initially very low due to chemotherapy.
While the ulcer was healing, you were fed with high calorie fluids (TPN) through the vein and then through a J-tube placed in your small intestine.
The tube feedings caused you to have diarrhea that was treated by changing the type of feedings, adding banana flakes, and occasionally using anti-diarrhea medicine after tests showed the diarrhea was not infectious.
Because the fluid came back after drainage, you had a pleurex catheter placed [**2166-4-29**].
You were continued on your enoxaparin (Lovenox) for blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary emboli), identified on your last admission.
The enoxaparin was held when procedures were necessary (bronchoscopy, pleuracentesis, PICC line placement, pleurex catheter placement, J-tube placement, placement of abcsess drain) and then restarted as soon as possible.
You will need to remain on antibiotics until the abscess and ulcer resolve, as determined by future CT scans (ideally with oral gastrograffin to evaluate the ulcer perforation; contrast through the J-tube will not reach this location).
These antibiotics will also treat the H. pylori infection, a bacteria that often causes ulcers.
While you were in the hospital, you developed thrush and were temporarily treated with nystatin swish and spit.
Your chemotherapy is on hold.
*** PLEASE ALERT THE RADIOLOGIST THAT ORAL GASTROGRAFFIN SHOULD BE USED TO EVALUATE THE ULCER PERFORATION.
