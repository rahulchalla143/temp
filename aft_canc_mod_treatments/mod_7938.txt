His mental status gradually improved with treatment of hypercalcemia in the ICU and he was tranferred to the floor.
His course of the floor was complicated by an episode of acute altered mental status thought to be due to seizure and he was started on keppra.
He started treatment for his multiple myeloma with good response in his SPEP and IgG Kappa labs and ultimately decided to undergo surgery to stabilize his femur fracture on [**4-21**] which was complicated only by some mild post-operative anemia requiring 4 units of pRBCs over 3 days.
He is due for his second cycle of chemotherapy on [**4-30**] of velcaide/dexamethasone.
Appeared intravascularly depleted on admission and sustained aggressive volume resuscitation with improvement in metabolic derangements.
Responded well to ECV repletion with IV fluids, IV bisphosphonate therapy and calcitonin SC.
Calcitonin was discontinued and calcium remained within normal range up to discharge.
Attempted IV naloxone infusion given opioid use and renal insufficiency which provided a quick response initially but did not clear the delirium.
Overall mental status improved with hydration and improvement in electrolyte imbalances.
24 hr EEG did not show any epileptiform featurs or electrographic seizures, however per neuro the decision was made to continue to treat with keppra 750 mg by mouth [**Hospital1 **].

He underwent palliative XRT of a lytic lesion in his femur.
He then underwent orthopedic surgery on [**4-21**] for repair and tolerated this well, only complicated by mild anemia post-operatively requiring 4 units pRBC over 3 days.
He will require extensive physical therapy both for his femur repair as well as his overall deconditioning (bedbound for ~34 days).
started vanc and zosyn for concern of possible aspiration pneumonia however CXR concerning for volume overload.
Abx dc'd on [**4-12**] and patient continued to remain afebrile.
He was continued on beta blocker, statin, aspirin, and imdur.
# OSA - Continued home bipap.
[**Date range (1) 92436**] ICU course: Patient was admitted with respiratory distress.
He was placed on CPAP and suctioned with removal of large mucous plugs.
He was taken off of narcotics and given IV tylenol.
