Admission Date:  [**2166-3-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-4-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2097-3-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Levofloxacin / Lisinopril / Diphenhydramine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3531**] Chief Complaint: S/p arrest in the OR during IP stent procedure.
Endotracheal intubation.
Left femoral tripple lumen catheter placement.
History of Present Illness: 69 y/o F with PMHX of COPD and Small Cell Lung Cancer (diagnosed [**2159**]) s/p XRT/chemo/tumor debridement/R mainstem bronchus stent placement ([**2164**]) and recent LUE DVT on Coumadin who initially presented to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital on [**3-27**] with 3-4 episodes of hemoptysis, increased cough, wheezing and shortness of breath.
She was started on IV SoluMedrol 125mg IV q6hrs, Nebs and tessalon pearles.
She was supratherapeutic with an INR of 4.1 and Coumadin was held.
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] and was continued on steroids, nebs and cough suppressants.
She went for flexible bronchoscopy on [**3-30**] which revealed normal trachea, extensive tumor at carina obstructing both mainstem bronchi, extrinsic mediastinal compression of L mainstem and unable to visualize stent in right mainstem due to intraluminal tumor.
Pt was taken to the OR on [**4-1**] and had stent placed in the left mainstem with good result.
There was attempted argon plasma coagulation inside of the right stent to remove intraluminal obstruction.
Pt was given an additional bolus of Midazolam and some neosynephrine for BP support prior to transfer to the ICU.
On arrival to the ICU, pt was intubated and sedated with HR >100 and BP 140/90s.
Sedation was rapidly weaned and pt was clearly responding to commands and moving all extremities.
Coumadin 5mg was started.
COPD - longstanding, unknown date of diagnosis 4.
Lupus - diagnosed 8 years ago after work-up for painful knee and finger joints (L finger joints > R finger joints) - treated with "pills" but not prednisone 5.
Shingles infection in T10 dermatome in [**10/2165**] - treated with acyclovir and recovered within 1 week 5.
Right eye cataract surgery 2.
Bronchial stent placement in [**2165-2-20**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] 3.
She drinks alcohol only on social occasions and uses no other drugs.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, pupils equal round & reactive to light, mucous membranes moist, no jugular venous distention, mucous membranes moist, oropharynx clear without thrush, no oropharyngeal source of bleeding seen Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no lymphadenopathy, no carotid bruits, loud and harsh inspiratory upper airway stridor heard, trachea not deviated Lungs: Nasal cannula intact, patient sitting upright with audible upper airway inspiratory and expiratory stridor.
Scattered inspiratory and expiratory wheezes but not consistently.
Stable appearance of bilateral bronchial stents and port with tip terminating within the upper SVC.
Consideration could be given to neck MRA or CTA to evaluate the cervical circulation, though the pattern suggests a proximal source.
[**2166-4-2**] Radiology BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS P Grayscale and color Doppler images of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed.
Upon initial placement small air bubbles visualized in ascending aorta.
PE also on the differential but no signs of significant RV failure, however inotropes (epinephrine) were administered.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 y/o F with PMHx of large mediastinal SCC s/p right mainstem stenting who presented with recurrent compressive symptoms who underwent OR placement of left mainstem stent and right mainstem APC complicated by hypoxia and PEA arrest.
Pt thought to have had PEA arrest after rigid bronchoscopy was removed, subsequent to L main stent placement for SCLC and use of argon anticoagulation.
Anticoagulation was initially held (For DVT) and patient was extubated succesfuly 3 days after initial intubation.
Her ventilatory support was minimal, RISBI was <105 with air leak and she was extuabted 24 hours after procedure.
Unfortunately, she developped stridor and increase number of secretions in the upper airways with respiratory rate in the 40s and SpO2 in 70s.
She required emergent re-intubation.
High-dose steroids (methylprednisolone 125 mg q 6hrs) were started and continued for 48 hours and patient was succesfully extubated on day 3.
Due to long standing disease with e/o hyperinflation on CXR and report of bronchospasm on presentation, she was also treated for COPD exacerbation with standing and prn nebulizers.
Thoracentesis was also performed.
Anticoagulation was held prior to procedure and re-started 24 hours afterwards (with lovenox) given her malignancy and higher bleeding risk.
Due to h/o DVT and atrial fibrillation as well as evidence of embolic stroke, anticoagulation was continued upon discharge.
Patient was hydrated and tachycardia did not improve.
She was started on metoprolol and it was titrated up to 50 mg TID which maintained a HR of 100 as monitored on telemetry.
Metoprolol was not further uptitrated as sinus tachycardia was thought to be secondary to her illness.
Would consider uptitration of metoprolol if rate requies better control.
SCLC: Pt with SCLC s/p chemo/radiation and now with L and R main bronchus metal stents.
Given that she has already received max radiation doses plan is to do brachitherapy and chemo as outpatient.
brachytherapy in the Bronchus intermedius in the next week.
Bacteremia: Pt grew STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE from a-line, which was removed <24 after positive blood culture and started on Vancomycin (Day 1 [**4-2**]).
Then, patient grew MRSA from sputum and plan was to treat with Vanc for 2 weeks given endovascular infection.
UTI: Pts urine was growing GNRs so ciprofloxacin was started.
She was switched to bactrim to continue treatment for 7 days (D1 [**4-5**]).

You were to have one of your stents reopened and have another stent placed in your lungs.
However, shortly after the procedure you developed very low blood pressure and required ICU hospitalization.
You were treated with steroids and nebulizers.
Your vocal cords show a candidal infection (thrush) so you should continue to gargle with nystatin swish and swallow.
You will require oxygen for some time until your lung function improved.
Also during your hospitalization you were found to have Staph aureus infection of your blood stream and possibly a Staph aureus pneumonia.
You will complete a 14 day course of Vancomycin (antibiotic).
You were also treated for atrial fibrillation (irregular heart rhythm) which requires medication to control the heart rate and continuation of blood thinners to prevent strokes.
You were previously on coumadin and this is being switched to lovenox.
At that time, the matter of continuing blood thinners can be readdressed.
Regarding treatment - you should discuss further treatment of your lung cancer with your pulmonologists and your primary oncologist.
Many medications were changed during this hospitalization: - you will start prednisone taper, ipratropium and albuterol for treatment of COPD - guifenessin has been added to break up mucus - bactrim and vancomycin have been added for treatment of urinary tract infection and blood stream infection - nystatin swish and swallow for treatment of oral and vocal throat [**Female First Name (un) **] infection (yeast).
Please gargle with this medication for most effective treatment.
- metoprolol has been started for better heart rate control.
stop taking diltiazem - lovenox has been started to thin the blood.
- aspirin has been discontinued due to increased risk of bleeding.
- lorazepam may be used as frequently as every 6 hrs as needed.
