She was recently discharged form the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2168-11-10**] after presenting with 1 day of blood-streaked sputum, mild dyspnea and wheezing in the setting of 6 months of a non-productive cough.
She was sent home with ten days of levofloxacin 500mg po daily for the pneumonia.
The CT on [**12-7**] showed bulky mediastinal adenopathy with collapse of the right middle bronchus, occlusion of the right superior pulmonary vein, encasement/constriction of the right main pulmonary artery and inferior pulmonary veins, displacement/deformation of the left atrium, and narrowing/invasion of the superior vena cava.
She received 40 mEq of PO KCl due to a level of 2.3 and was put on telemetry.
Past Medical History: hypertension GERD uterine fibroids hyperlipidemia anxiety disorder macular degeneration urinary incontinence pancreatitis in [**9-/2167**] colonoscopy on [**2168-11-30**] showed several adenomatous polyps normal EGD on [**2168-11-30**]   Social History: Ms. [**Known lastname 83347**] grew up in [**Location (un) **].
She has been smoking 3-4packs of cigarettes for 53 years.
Physical Exam: T 96.8  BP 156/100  HR 96  RR 20  Sat 96% on 2L Gen: mildly Cushingoid, pleasant, no acute distress HEENT: clear OP, no icterus, EOMI, PERRL Neck: no carotid bruits, no wheezing/stridor, no thyromegaly Chest: faint expiratory wheezing in right middle lung field Breasts: patient declined examination CV: regular rate/rhythm, normal S1S2, no murmurs, no S3 or S4 heard Abd: protuberant, soft, nontender, moderately distended, tympanic, ?dullness to percussion in R flank Back: no CVA tenderness Extr: no edema, 2+ PT pulses Neuro: A&O x3, CN 2-12 intact, [**6-17**] grip strength bilaterally, [**6-17**] arm and shoulder flexion/extension bilaterally, [**6-17**] hip/knee/ankle flexion/extension Skin: ?mild hyperpigmentation, no rashes/lesions  Pertinent Results: CT Chest ([**12-7**]): The hilar component of a 6 x 5cm, mass involving the right hilus and middle mediastinum, obstructs the right middle lobe bronchus, producing collapse of the RML, significantly narrows the upper lobe bronchus and protrudes into the bronchus intermedius, narrowing it as well.
Pt was seen by Interventional Pulm who placed a stent in her RML bronchus ~[**12-8**] and obtained a biopsy which revealed small cell carcrinoma.
She received 3 doses of carboplatin and etoposide on [**11-9**], and [**12-14**].
She was therefore given an additional 2 Units [**12-14**].
[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]: # GIB: Pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**12-17**] for repeat EGD in the setting of GIB.
As such, lower GI source was suspected, given recent polypectomy on [**11-30**].
However, pt's diarrhea contained only modest melena/red streaks.
Pt continued to require multiple transfusions to maintain HCT > 25, suggesting ongoing bleeding, thus she remained in the ICU and received an additional unit of PRBC on [**12-18**] and [**12-19**], in addition to 1 bag platelets.
Her atenolol was held in the setting of GIB.
pt was also evaluated by surgical service with regard to operative management of lower GIB, with decision to defer surgical intervention given lack of definitive source of bleeding.
# Hypokalemia/Hypernatremia - most likely secondary to ACTH-secreting SCLC (cortisol 167).
Spirinolactone was continued as pt's SBPs remained stable throughout her GIB episode.
Pt continued to have [**Hospital1 **] lytes and active repletion of K.   She was also continued on spironalactone (started [**12-9**]), at 50mg qdaily.
In addition, she was started on glypizide on [**12-21**] given her likelihood of continuing to have elevated FSBS [**3-17**] ACTH secretion.
# Hypertension: BP well controlled despite holding atenolol for active GIB.
Good UOP after foley placement (pt was incontinent x 3 [**12-17**]), and creatinine remained at baseline throughout [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course.
pt was continued on spirinolactone for hyperaldosterone state as above.
As such, low dose ativan 0.5 mg IV prn was used.
Did not feel ativan was contributing given she has been receiving this throughout hospital course in low-dose form.
No intervention was felt necessary, and pt was subsequently intubated and sedated for colonoscopy.
# COPD: pt continued on Albuterol/Atrovent nebs.
Will hold tiotropium while hospitalized .
however on [**12-22**] pt was prepped for colonoscopy and remained NPO until she expired.
# PPX:  No heparin given compromise of great vessels by tumor; pneumoboots, IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].
Medications on Admission: atenolol 50mg daily augmentin (since [**12-1**]) celexa 20mg daily ferrous sulfate 325mg daily ativan 2mg qhs nexium 40mg qhs  Discharge Medications: none.
