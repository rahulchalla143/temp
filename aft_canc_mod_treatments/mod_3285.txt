The patient received 20 mg IV lasix on the floor and urinated about 550 cc prior to moving down to the ICU.
At that time, he was initiated on hyper CVAD chemotherapy.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course has been complicated by tumor lysis syndrome which has been treated with aggressive IV fluids.
Metoprolol was gradually uptitrated but he experienced increasing dyspnea.
There was also interlobular septal thickening at the right base, and small bilateral effusions with ddx including pulmonary edema, DAH, and infection.
He was empirically treated with vanc, levo, and voriconazole.
On the evening of [**8-14**], Mr. [**Known lastname 5395**] continued to be tachycardic to 140s in AF despite up-titration of metoprolol to 100mg PO.
At that time, he was diuresed with 20 mg IV lasix and sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where bronchoscopy demonstrated previous pulmonary hemorrhage but no active bleeding.
He was diuresed effectively and actually converted out of afib while on diltiazem gtt.
At the time of transfer back to the flor, the patient was comfortable on 3 L NC with oxygen saturations in the mid 90s.
FH: non-contributory  Physical Exam: PE: T 97.5 BP 175/88 HR 81 O2 96% on NRB, 88% on RA Gen: alert, middle-aged male, slightly cachectic, in slight respiratory distress with alopecia HEENT: [**Last Name (un) 2599**] dry, wearing NRB, PERRL, scattered petechiae on face Neck: JVP at 10 cm, no lymphadenopathy Chest: diffuse wheezing throughout, crackles at right base CV: RRR, no murmur appreciated though heart sounds difficult to hear due to wheezing Abd: normoactive bowel sounds, nontender to palpation throughout Ext: 1+ peripheral edema to the knees, warm & well perfused throughout Neuro: grossly intact, face symmetric, moving extremities without difficulty   Pertinent Results: Imaging:  [**8-12**] MRI HEAD HISTORY: 55-year-old man with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with tumor lysis syndrome, and now numbness of the right jaw concerning for cranial nerve involvement.
TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1; axial post-gadolinium T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI, DTI of the head as well as axial 3-mm T1, post-gadolinium T1 with fat sat, T2; coronal T2 with fat-sat and post-gadolinium T1 with fat-sat images of the skull base were obtained.
The visualized oral cavity, oropharynx, and nasopharynx are normal.
The right inferior turbinate is not seen, which may be due to prior surgical resection.
There is decreased T1 signal of the visualized bone marrow of the calvarium and cervical spine which is a nonspecific finding but may represent involvement by lymphoma or marrow reconversion.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT imaging of the chest was performed without intravenous contrast.
CT CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: A right PIC catheter terminates within the right atrium, and repositioning is recommended.
A representative right paratracheal node measures 6 mm in short axis, previously 9 mm.
Additional lymph nodes are equally decreased in size.
Calcified granulomas in the right lower lobe (3/36, 3/41) are consistent with prior granulomatous infection.
Right PIC catheter terminates in the right atrium.
[**2184-8-30**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM  The left atrium is normal in size.
FISH was carried out and was positive for c-myc rearrangement, as well as IgH.
He tolerated the chemo well, but required close monitoring of his volume status (diastolic HF) and his oxygenation, as well as tumor lysis status.
It was somewhat challenging to keep his platelets up and he required numerous transfusions of platelets and RBCs.
Upon stabilization and return to the floor, the patient received prophylactic intrathecal methotrexate.
Etiology of SOB was initially not clear, but includes pulmonary edema, pneumonia (aspergillus), PE, and MI, DAH.
The patient's respiratory status improved with an increase in his daily dose of lasix, and he remained asymptomatic once transferred to the floor, on no oxygen.
His blood pressure medications were uptitrated with good response.
Hemoptsysis did not recur.
Creatinine improved on lanthanum and aluminum hydroxide with resolution of the syndrome and close monitoring of fluid balance.
Patient was started on antifungal therapy with voriconazole and maintained on that regimen until time of transfer.
Therefore patient was started on flagyl and three stool samples had been sent for C. difficile toxin.
However had received ifosfamide with Mesna and cyclophosphamide.
