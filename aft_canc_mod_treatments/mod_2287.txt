HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old male with an extensive past medical history, as noted above in the admission and discharge diagnoses, who has been having recurrent right pleural effusions postoperatively after his coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement in [**2129-10-15**].
Initially, this was attributed secondary to Dressler's syndrome which he had postoperatively which was treated successfully with Lasix and prednisone.
The chest was notable for prior sternotomy scar and right posterior incision from prior surgery.
He was subsequently taken to the Operating Room on [**2131-6-6**] where intraoperatively, the patient went into sudden asystole which was treated by intraoperative atropine and chest compressions.
Epinephrine was subsequently given.
This occurred towards the end of the procedure and the incision was subsequently closed and the patient was taken to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit where he remained intubated, sedate, and V paced with a stable blood pressure.
While in the CSRU, the patient continued with temporary pacing wires pending further evaluation by the Electrophysiology Service.
These were switched to stable 6F pacer wires on the evening of postoperative day number zero.
He did have an episode of acute renal insufficiency which was thought to be prerenal secondary to dehydration in which the patient's creatinine did subsequently recover after hydration was given.
Protonix 40 mg once a day.
Lipitor 20 mg once a day.
