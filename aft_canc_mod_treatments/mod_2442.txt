Admission Date:  [**2198-9-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2198-10-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2122-4-3**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Urology  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman with a history of diabetes for 63 years, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, who on work-up for hematuria was noted to have a right feeling defect in the renal pelvis.
The brush biopsy of renal pelvis was suspicious for transitional cell carcinoma and he came back for elective right nephrectomy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes, who is managed in the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center, also Paget's disease status post open reduction and internal fixation in [**2198**], hypertension, hypercholesterolemia.
MEDICATIONS:  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q day, Cardia 120 mg q day, Aspirin 81 mg q day, Pravachol and Insulin.
The operation was complicated by excessive bleeding with estimated blood loss of 3,500 cc.
The patient received 10 liters of crystalloids during the operation.
That required nitro drip to obtain adequate control.
He required multiple doses of IV fluid bolus.
However, he responded to IV doses of Lasix for diuresis.
Renal consult was obtained and the decreasing renal function was felt to be due to the transient hypoperfusion during the operation when his blood pressure was dropped to low 100's for approximately an hour.
He required several doses of IV Lopressor and IV Diltiazem to slow down his heart rate and convert it back to sinus rhythm.
He was then transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit for continuous IV infusion of Diltiazem to control his heart rate.
The etiology of this episode of atrial fibrillation without prior history remained unclear, however, it was thought that his status of fluid overload may contribute to the cause.
He started to pass gas and diet was slowly restarted.
On the day of discharge he tolerated a full diet without any problems.
His central line and Foley catheter was discontinued on postoperative day #8.
He required a minimum amount of pain medication and made good amount of urine.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q day, NPH insulin 10 units in the morning, 6 units in the evening, insulin sliding scale with regular insulin, Lopressor 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], Percocet [**2-14**] po q 4-6 hours as needed and Diltiazem long release 240 mg every morning.
