Brief Hospital Course: Assessment/Plan: 50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2, mini-allograft SCT, DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary fibrosis on home 02 presents with sepsis.
- IVF resuscitation for MAP>65 - Vanc, zosyn, levofloxacin, bactrim, caspofungin to cover broadly for now given critical illness - Blood, urine, sputum cultures - Legionella antigen, glucan, galactomannan - CT chest and possible bronch when more stable - Follow WBC count, fever curve - PPD to be read [**4-17**] .
Avoid high pressures given fibrotic lungs, will attempt pressure control to limit.
- Continue mechanical ventilatory support, wean as tolerated .
[**Month (only) 116**] require paralysis for adequate ventilation.
- Continue to trend enzymes and treat underlying cause - ASA, hold on beta-blocker and statin - TTE to eval for wall motion abnormality - Repeat ECG .
# Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte transplant [**12-8**].
- BMT to follow - Avoid steroids given risk to graft - Continue acyclovir ppx for now, will discuss with BMT .
Patient remained intubated throughout hospital stay.
Was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for sepsis.
Given his immunocompromised status empiric anti-[**Month/Year (2) 1065**] therapy was begun as well.
Baseline lung disease with fibrosis [**2-3**] to GVHD and need for aggressive fluid resuscitation lead to increasing difficulty with ventilation.
In setting of hypotension developed shock liver with transaminases in 1000's.
