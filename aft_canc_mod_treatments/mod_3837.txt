He had wheezes on exam and was given bronchodilators with some improvement.
The patient had elevated CE at the OSH, he was started on Heparin despite the most likely diagnosis being demand ischemia in the setting of hypoxia.
He was on BiPap at the OSH for his decreased saturation.
Chronic back pain s/p laminectomy 6.
Splenectomy s/p motor vehicle accident 7.
A CT showed tracheal compression and compression of [**Last Name (LF) 17911**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he underwent a tracheal stent and inominate stenting.
He was trasiently intubated for hypoxia but improved.
However, following his first treatments of chemo and radiotherpay the patient requested to have his code status changed to DNR/DNI on [**2160-9-28**].
Therefore, at night he had been on face mask with FiO2 titrated to keep his oxygen saturation at 90 or above.
During the day he had been satting in the mid 90s on nasal cannula oxygen.
Tissue was obtained from both bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy.
He will be treated with a 5 week course of radiotherapy four times per week along with weekly radiosensitizing chemotherapy of carbaplatin and paclitaxel.
He received his first dose of radiation therpay on [**9-24**] and his first dose of chemotherpay on [**9-25**].
He was also put on atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
Vena Cava Syndrome: Shortly after arrival to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU, the patient had a stent placed in his right inominate artery.
The patient was also anticoagulated with heparin with a goal PTT of 60-80 for the vascular stent, however this was discontinued on [**2160-9-26**] after the patient developed a retroperitoneal bleed.
It is possiblke that the poneumonia was postobstructive from the lung cancer or alternatively from aspiration following the tracheal stent placement.
His hct dropped 10 points, and his heparin was discontinued.
