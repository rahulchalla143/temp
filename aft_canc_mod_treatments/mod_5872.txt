Patient was initially treated with the following antibiotics:  Zithromax, cefepime, and Vancomycin.
There was concern regarding her relative immunosuppression and therefore, the patient was started on Bactrim treatment and was transferred to the MICU for management of hypoxia, possible intubation, and concern for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].
She continued to complain of sensation of shortness of breath, but denied any chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
She was maintained on triple antibiotic regimen, however, persistently spiked and without any change in her chest x-ray or symptoms.
The patient had a history of oral herpetic lesions in the past and was started on acyclovir as well.
The patient's family agreed to pursue comfort measures only.
In summary, given the patient's overall poor prognosis and ongoing hypoxia despite very broad coverage with antimicrobials, a family meeting confirmed the patient's code status DNR/DNI as well as pursuing comfort measures only.
All of her antibiotics were withdrawn and the patient was put on a Morphine drip titration to comfort measures.
