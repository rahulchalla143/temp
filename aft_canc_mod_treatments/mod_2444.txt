Appearances are most consistent with a Klatskin- type cholangiocarcinoma which does not appear amenable to resection given the involvement of all the right and left main biliary ducts.
She developed GI bleeding in setting of supratherapeutic PTT requiring 3U PRBC transfusion and monitoring in the ICU.
This resolved with stopping the heparin and holding her coumadin.
After family meeting on [**5-30**] goals of care were changed to palliation and since she had no further GI bleeding or pain with stable bilirubin, it was decided that should would have the ERCP and stent placement in the future if she developed any symptoms which can be arranged required no pain medication when in hospital but they can likely .
Coumadin was held due to supratherapeutic INR and need for interventions.
She remained supratherapeutic with elevated PT and PTTs after vitamin K orally.
Subcutaneous vitamin K was also administered.
She had the UGIB as describe above so the decision was made to hold her coumadin and aspirin indefinitely due to risk of GI bleeding.
She should continue on protonix twice a day since there was no clear source of GI bleeding.
Her INR was 1.5 and PTT was in the 70s from subcutaneous heparin administration for DVT prevention.
A right IJ TLC was placed, she was resucitated with IVF and 3 units prbcs.
After hematocrits were normal for 24 hours she was sent back to the flood with a left picc line in place which we will leave in place and removal can be determined at rehab.
# Hypotension: Patients blood pressure was noted to be lower 90-110s/60s after admission without signs of cardiac dysfunction or infection.
Her lisinopril was held with good effect but restarted along with lasix due to symptoms of volume overload.
# CAD: presumed stable ECG with evidence of previous ischemia, patient had no pain, she but asprin was stopped due to GI bleed.
# Metabolic acidosis without gap: Due to saline IVF, once these were stopped, bicarb levels improved.
