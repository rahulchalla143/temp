An anterior cervical fusion device is partially imaged.
Interval partial decompression of the ileal conduit, status post percutaneous placement of a large-bore conduit catheter.
Large parastomal mass, several omental metastases, and retroperitoneal/pararectal lymphadenopathy, though unchanged compared to CT from earlier today, are new compared to the [**3-26**], [**2196**] study.
Brief Hospital Course: 44 year old man with past medical history of metastatic bladder cancer s/p neoadjuvant chemo, followed by radical cystoprostatectomy with ileal conduit urinary diversion, radiation who was brought in for AMS and found to have [**Last Name (un) **] and bilateral hydronephrosis secondary to a high density obstruction temporarily relieved with red [**Doctor First Name **] catheter awaiting further management.
The patient was treated with IV fluids.
Pt had IR placement of percutaneous catheter into ileal conduit on [**2196-8-11**].
Sensitivities showed VRE, and Linezolid was not an option given multiple interactions with patient's other medications.
Therefore, the patient was offered the option of having a PICC placed for home IV therapy.
#Metabolic Derangments: Patient initially presented with anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and hyponatremia.
It resolved after volume resuscitation.
#Goals of Care / Pain Management: Goals of care were discussed between the patient, his family, the MICU team, the [**Location (un) 2274**] Palliative Care attending, the Hospice nurse, the Urology team, the patient's primary urologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the Hem/Onc Consult Service, Interventional Radiology, and the patient's primary oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Therefore, percutaneous catheter was placed by IR, as discussed above.
The patient's pain was managed with fentanyl patch, which we increased in dose from 150mcg Q72H to 200mcg Q72H at the recommendation of the Atrius Palliative Care attending.
For break-through pain, the patient was first treated with IV fentanyl, then with PO oxycodone (which was discontinued due to myoclonus), and finally PO Dilaudid 4mg 1-2 tabs q4h PRN.
