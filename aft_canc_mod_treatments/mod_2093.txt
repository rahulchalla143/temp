Admission Date:  [**2120-9-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2120-9-28**]  Date of Birth:   [**2058-6-2**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Company 191**]  PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old male with a history of metastatic malignant melanoma metastatic to liver, lungs, and brain and small bowel who was admitted with right flank pain times two days and shortness of breath times two days.
Patient was first diagnosed in [**2107**] with melanoma and has been complicated by cerebral hemorrhage in [**12/2119**] with associated seizures status post craniotomy and also by the aforementioned metastases to liver and small bowel.
Patient most recently has been treated on Dilantin, thalidomide, Temozolomide.
This patient is status post numbers of years of chemotherapy and adjuvant treatment, including Interferon, IL2, and the most recent therapy listed above.
Patient was enrolled in the current clinical trial in [**2120-6-30**], which has included whole-brain radiation, Temozolomide, and thalidomide.
Patient was not started on anticoagulation given his past medical history of spontaneous bleeding and his melanoma metastases to the brain.
Brain metastases status post XRT whole-brain radiation in the spring and summer of [**2120**].
Dilantin 300 b.i.d.
Chemotherapy with Temozolomide and thalidomide, as mentioned before.
EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  94% Oxygen saturation on two liters nasal cannula.
Patient also went directly to Interventional Radiology as he was not a candidate for coagulation for aforementioned spontaneous intracranial bleed.
In [**2119-12-31**] patient had IVC filter placed as well as an echocardiogram to evaluate the hemodynamic effects of the pulmonary embolism and to guide IV fluid therapy.
Patient had successful placement of Gunther-Tulip vena cava filter just below the level of the renal vein from the common femoral approach.
Again, the issue of anticoagulation was addressed on [**2120-9-25**] with differing specialists suggesting alternative approaches.
The results of the CT were no acute hemorrhage or mass effect, stable appearance of the right frontal lobe resection bed, and left cerebral hemorrhage likely due to punctate left cerebellar tonsillar metastases.
This result like the issue of anticoagulation remaining complex.
Patient was loathed to begin anticoagulation and wanted to wait and see if he had more sequelae from clotting before addressing anticoagulation, especially given that he had a filter placed to prevent further pulmonary embolus from the lower extremities.
Pulmonology does not recommend anticoagulation with the idea that Heparin would not significantly affect propagation of the existing clot and the clot would eventually be reabsorbed and the patient would still have significant risk of bleeding into his metastatic lesion.
Given these results pain was attributed to the existing pulmonary embolus, and pain was eventually controlled on intravenous Dilaudid.
Phenytoin 300 mg p.o.
Colace 200 mg p.o.
Benadryl 25 mg p.o.
Dilaudid 4 mg tablets, three to five tablets p.o.
Zofran 8 mg tablets, one tablet p.o.
