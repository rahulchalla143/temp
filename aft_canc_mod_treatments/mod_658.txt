Interventional radiology was consulted for possible repeat thoracentesis or pleurX catheter placement but did not feel there was enough fluid on ultrasound to safely attempt thoracentesis.
Patient has remained comfortable with her breathing despite her oxygen requirement.
Given history of liver mets near the IVC there was concern for obstruction of venous return, though abdominal imaging did not demonstrate any IVC obstruction though the read did comment on intra-hepatic attenuation of the IVC likelyy due to extensive liver metastases.
(3) METASTATIC BREAST CANCER:  OMED team in contact with primary oncologist Dr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15759**] who did not support further chemotherapy given patient's poor prognosis.
