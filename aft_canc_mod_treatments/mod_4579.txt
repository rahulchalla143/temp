She was treated with combinations of velcade, decadron, cytoxan, Revlimid from [**8-/2149**] thru [**4-/2150**] with a decrease in paraproteinemia, but without significant response on bone marrow biopsies.
She began the mobilization and harvesting phase of autologous bone marrow transplant on [**2150-9-10**] with high dose Cytoxan.
Her autologous transplant was on [**2150-10-19**].
Her transplant occurred as per protocol with Melphalan conditioning; and she received supportive consults with nutrition and social work.

Bones of the skull and of the visualized cervical vertebrae show heterogenously hypointense marrow signal on T1-weighted images, which likely represents diffuse marrow infiltration by multiple myeloma  [**11-11**] EEG: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of rhythmic and sharply contoured epileptiform discharges which evolve in frequency consistent with non-convulsive status epilepticus.
This abates after administration of lorazepam, then recurred for about two hours, and remitted again after lorazepam and levetiracetam.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo woman with rheumatoid arthritis and multiple myeloma now s/p autoSCT D+22, presenting with weakness, chills and fever to 101.0F.
Started on empiric aztreonam and vancomycin.
Patient was given supportive care.
Patient was loaded with keppra and dilantin and seizures had resolved x 4 days prior to transfer out of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2150-11-17**].
She was continued on Dilantin and Keppra throughout her course and was followed by neurology.
#MM s/p SCT: Patient s/p recent autostem cell transplant (discharged the day prior to this admission), admitted from Hope Lodge.
Continued Atovaquone and Acyclovir prophylaxis, CBC monitored.
She required 2 units PRBCs and 1 unit plts throughout her stay to keep hct >21, plts >11.
She was discharged with a plan to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic the following day for continued care for her multiple myeloma.
# Candidal esophagitis:  developed a severe case of candidal esophagitis that prevented her from taking PO meds or nutrition for 1-2 days.
She was started on metoprolol at 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with improved control of her rate and pressures.
TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES: - Needs a follow up dilantin level sometime between [**Date range (1) 87667**] (5-7 days after last change in dosage) - Will need to follow up with neurology for further care and monitoring for her seizures - Follow up BP and HR control on metoprolol  Medications on Admission: 1. levofloxacin 750 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q24H (every  24 hours) for 3 days: take on [**2150-11-9**], [**2150-11-10**], [**2150-11-11**].
