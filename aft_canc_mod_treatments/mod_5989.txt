Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo F with multiple myeloma on Thalidomide and Decadron who presents with progressive DOE x 6 weeks, hypoxia, hypotension, and ARF.
Given her hypoxia, elevated A-a gradient (297), history of multiple myeloma and her treatment with Thalidomide and Decadron (known to be thrombogenic and pt.
Her Thalidomide was discontinued and she was started on a Heparin drip.
The Heparin drip was continued and she was started on Coumadin.
recent long car ride and thalidomide), will anticipate ~6 months of anticoagulation with INR [**3-4**].
She was continued on ASA 81 mg. Metoprolol 12.5 was added once her BP could tolerate it.
A statin should perhaps be considered given an LDL in [**March 2112**] of 131; this can be revisited as an outpatient.
She also has a history of chronic LE edema for which she takes Lasix and Triamterine as an outpatient.
Given her ARF, her diuretics were held.
On transfer to BMT, she was restarted on her outpatient dose of Lasix since she had some trace LE edema and b/l pulmonary crackles.
Her Ace-inhibitor was still held because of her resolving ARF.
She was initially treated empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn for concern of sepsis given the high lactate.
She was never febrile and her vitals stabilized so the antibiotics were d/c'd on day 2 of hospitalization.
Her BP meds (Diltiazem and Lisinopril) were held, but a Metoprolol 12.5 was started on [**10-5**] because her blood pressure had improved and because of her cardiac risk factors.
All diuretics were held as was Metformin for concern of lactic acidosis in the setting of ARF.
Outpatient Metformin was held because of ARF.
FS were done QID with humalog/SSI until all blood sugars were normal.
She did not require insulin while on the medical floor.
8 Prophylaxis: PPI (on steroids), heparin gtt, bowel regimen.
