Given 1L NS and 1 unit pRBCs and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.
Motor: [**5-8**] in elbow flexor/extensor, finger grips, [**5-8**] in hip flexors, knee flexors/extensors, ankle plantar flexor/dorsiflexor.
If there is clinical concern for acalculous cholecystitis, HIDA scan is recommended.
Percutaneous cholecystostomy tube remains in place within a decompressed gallbladder without evidence of adjacent fluid collection.
No evidence of complication of the percutaneous cholecystostomy tube which is within a decompressed gallbladder.
The possibility of a CT guided biopsy can be discussed with the cross-sectional interventional radiologists.
As stated on prior report, these can be followed up with a CT chest within four weeks or the possibility of biopsy can be considered.
No specific pathogen is suggested but a right-sided thoracentesis may be considered for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
An echodense structure is seen in the right atrium suggestive of a catheter tip.
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells in the CD45 moderate/dim , moderate side scatter "blast" gate express immature antigens CD34, HLA-DR, myeloid associated antigens CD13, CD15, CD117, CD11c, TdT (dim, subset), lymphoid associated antigens CD2 (dim, subset), CD7 (dim) lack other B and T cell associated antigens are CD10 negative, and are negative for CD14, CD41, CD56, CD64.
[**2128-3-25**] BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY.
Red blood cells are markedly reduced in number, variably hypochromic with anisopoikilocytosis including occasional dacrocytes and elliptocytes seen.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: It consists of a 0.7 cm core biopsy of periosteum, cortical bone and trabecular marrow with a cellularity of 70-80%.
[**2128-3-25**] CYTOGENETICS: KARYOTYPE: 47,XY,+14[13]/46,XY[7] INTERPRETATION: Of 20 cells studied, thirteen comprised an ABNORMAL clone with trisomy 14.
Trisomy 14 is not associated with a particular cytogenetic prognosis.
Red blood cells are hypochromic and normocytic with anisopoikilocytosis including elliptocytes, rare dacrocytes and target cells.
[**2128-5-7**] BONE MARROW CORE BIOPSY: HYPOCELLULAR MARROW WITH RESIDUAL BLASTS AND SCANT ERYTHROPOIESIS (SEE NOTE) Note: The marrow aspirate and core biopsy reveals residual blasts (~40-50%).
In a patient with chemo-ablation, these residual blasts may indicate residual leukemic blasts, some undergoing chemotherapy induced cell death.
While highly consistent with residual / recurrent / refractory disease, the clinical course is best assessed by following peripheral blood counts and cytogenetics in conjunction with clinical correlation.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The core biopsy material is adequate for evaluation with a core biopsy approximately 1 cm in length.
Erythroid precursors are seen scattered in small pockets within the marrow fat.
Special Stains: Iron stain reveal mostly storage iron within empty appearing spicules.
[**2128-5-27**] BONE MARROW BIOPSY: MARKEDLY HYPOCELLULAR ERYTHROID-DOMINANT BONE MARROW WITH LEFT-SHIFTED HEMATOPOIESIS AND SCANT MEGAKARYOCYTES.
Differential shows 100% lymphocytes  BM Biopsy [**2128-6-9**]: MARKEDLY HYPOCELLULAR ERYTHROID DOMINANT BONE MARROW WITH DYSPLASTIC HEMATOPOIESIS AND INCREASED BLASTS, SEE NOTE.
Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material shows numerous markedly hypocellular spicules consisting of stromal cells, histiocytes, and plasma cells.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material consists of core of about equal parts cortical bone and subcortical trabecular marrow space that is virtually acellular, precluding blast count by immunohistochemistry.
Note: The findings are consistent with a hypoplastic marrow after multiple rounds of induction chemotherapy.
BM Cytology [**2128-6-9**] KARYOTYPE: NO ABERRATIONS DETECTED; SEE BELOW KARYOTYPE: 46,XY[8].nuc ish(CCND1,IGH@)x2[100] Cell culture of this specimen yielded only eight metaphase cells for chromosome analysis.
Interphase FISH did not detect any evidence of the trisomy 14 present in prior specimens.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION Peripheral Blood Smear: Red blood cells are normochromic with anisopoikilocytosis including macrocytes, elliptocytes and spherocytes seen.

Differentiating myeloid cells present.
Displaced percutaneous cholecystostomy tube terminating anterior to the liver, similar to [**2128-10-10**].
Colonic intramural fat is similar to prior and may represent chronic colitis but this finding can also be observed as a normal finding-epsecially in patients with intrabdominal fat   Brief Hospital Course: = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ================================================================                       PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ================================================================ [**3-25**]: Admitted with 1-2 months of progressive fatigue, found to have acute leukemia - WBC 68k (96% blasts), hct 10%, plt 85k.
[**8-12**]: Began granulocyte infusion x 5 days.
[**8-13**]: Central line removed for concern for line infection, no growth from line.
[**8-14**]: PICC placed [**8-15**]: EEG for altered mental status, dysarthria - generalized periodic epileptic wave forms.
PICC repositioned, but consistently has problems drawing back requiring tPA.
Given the degree of leukocytosis, he was started on hydroxyurea overnight.
Thus, he completed another round of chemotherapy (MEC D1C1 [**2128-5-15**]) after which repeat biopsy revealed that the bone marrow had been ablated.
Persistently neutropenic on filgrastim until WBC counts began to recover [**2128-8-12**] to > 0.1 and continued to uptrend to 2.5 by [**8-27**].
Consulted psychiatry on [**6-11**], who recommended starting mirtazapine qhs for appetite and sleep, which was started but then discontinued on [**6-13**] given concern for increased somnolence.
TPN was discontinued on [**6-23**] in an attempt to stimulate appetite.
He was also started on a calorie count and ritalin on [**6-24**].
Ritalin increased to [**Hospital1 **] dosing on [**6-25**].
Pt did ~300Kcal/day on calorie count and received Megace for appetite stimulation.
TPN was not restarted.
Flagyl and megace eventually discontinued, but meropenem continued in setting of persistent neutropenia.
He was initially started on Cefepime ([**2128-3-25**]) for febrile neutropenia (WBC was high, but had 0% neutrophils) without improvement in his fever curve.
FEVER CLUSTER #1 - Vancomycin was added on [**2128-3-26**] for continued low grade temperature.
Vancomycin was discontinued [**4-10**] given no fevers.
FEVER CLUSTER #2 - Vancomycin was added on [**6-8**] and fungal coverage was broadened to Ambisome on [**6-9**] given subpleural based opacity and multiple pulmonary nodules.
Daptomycin converted to vancomycin for increased lung penetration.
Vancomycin was DC'd on [**6-25**] as pt was persistently afebrile and acyclovir was DC'd on [**6-29**] for the same reason.
Perc chole tube placed [**8-9**].
Repeat echocardiogram on [**8-31**] showed no valvular abnormalities suggestive of endocarditis, EF >55%.
#) ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: Baseline creatinine 1.0.
Etiology was likely multifactorial including dehydration from discontinuation of TPN/poor po intake and multiple nephrotoxic medications (vancomycin, ambisome and acyclovir).
[**Last Name (un) **] #2: Creatinine increasing around [**8-18**] after VRE grew from blood likely sepsis related with peak at 2.0.
Gentamycin started for synergy which likely worsened [**Last Name (un) **] but eventually downtrended back to baseline on IVF.
S/p _______ units of blood and ________ units of platelets.
Patient received biliary drain placement on [**8-9**] as non-operative intervention for cholecystitis.
General surgery saw patient, felt patient needed cholecystectomy but not a good surgical candidate.
General surgery reevaluated the patient on [**9-1**] and commented that the perc chole is draining well; cholecystectomy not indicated at this time due to poor health status and other foci of infection.
Patient not following commands and alert and oriented only to self.
No bony erosion was evident and therefore no ENT intervention needed.
ICU Issues: ================ 62yo M with refractory AML admitted on [**3-24**] and now s/p double cord SCT on [**2128-7-30**].
In [**Month (only) 216**], had severe biliary sepsis (not choly candidate, so perc tube placed).
Readmitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**10-11**] - [**10-17**] for biliary sepsis/peritonitis and hypoxic respiratory distress post ERCP stent placement procedure on [**10-11**].
His mental status was worsening, Tbilis trending up, increasing abdominal pain and distention, worsening sepsis despite broad coverage antibiotics and antifungals.
Decision was made to intubate the patient and go for a CT guided paracentesis and perc chole drain interrogation study with IR.
Paracentesis showed that fluid in the abdomen was bile   and the tube interrogation demonstrated that bile was leaking into the peritoneum  and that the perc tube was displaced and terminating anterior to the liver.
He was given 150 of bicarb in hopes that pressors effectiveness would improve.
His vent settings was changed to pressure support to allow him to increase his respirations and help decrease his acidosis.
He had a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placed.
His mental status improved with continued treatment and given his prior RUQ pain, suspect biliary souce w/ possible biliary sepsis.
No organisms grew probably because he was on very broad antibiotic coverage.
Pt tranferred back to the floor but returned to the ICU on [**10-11**] for biliary sepsis post ERCP procedure where stent was placed to redirect bile from gallbladder to the bowel.
Unclear etiology, but likely due to sepsis and was very broadly covered with abx as above.
Thoracentesis contraindicated given bleeding risk with thrombocytopenia.
RSBI 27, satting well on PEEP 5, RAS -1.
He was continued to be broadly covered for possible pneumonia with micafungin, bactrim ppx, dapto, and [**Last Name (un) 2830**].
Thought to be multifactorial including ATN/prerenal secondary to sepsis and AIN secondary to CMV and/or meds (foscarnet).
Continued to fluid resuscitate as needed.
All medications were also renally dosed.
# cholecystitis/biliary leakage/biliary peritonitis: percutaneous tube placed on [**8-/2128**] given that patient was not candidate for cholecystectomy.
Drain put out about >1L per day and there was concern for nutritional and medication losses in bile.
He was continued on ursodiol.
#AML: Pt is s/p double cord allo transplant with evidence of engraftment.
Pt previously unable to tolerate PO meds and was transitioned from tacto to cyclosporine IV.
Initially on gancyclovir but viral load continued to rise and was switched to Foscarnet, which was renally dosed.
# PRES: diagnosed on MRI head on [**9-30**] and emperically treated for HSV encephalitis.
Cyclosporine was titrated to goal of 200.
Indirect bili 0.9 and haptoglobin 212, thus unlikely to be hemolysis.
The patient received a one time dose of IVIG on [**9-15**] 500mg/kg IV (sucrose-free IVIG) X 1 dose  #Adrenal insufficiency: Diagnosis based on hypotension and random cortisol level of 8.6.
Rechecked cortisol was 12.5  ISSUES ONLY PERTAINING TO [**9-10**] - [**9-17**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission  #Skin ulceration: Pt noted to have ulceration on L forearm with surrounding erythema.
EEG on [**2128-9-6**] did not show epileptiform activity and levetiracetam was discontinued.
Mental status has greatly improved therefore we will not pursue LP at this time given bleeding risk with thrombocytopenia, although ID recommends further workup rather than keeping on high dose acyclovir due to fear of inducing renal failure given Pt is also on ambisome and cyclosporine.
Doubt HSV encephalitis given rapid changes in condition.
-continue diuresis with furosemide 20mg iv (possibly [**Hospital1 **]) goal neg 2 L daily -Check pm lytes  # GIB: Resolved.
Likely [**2-5**] instrumentation from OG tube placement in setting of thrombocytopenia.
- Trend H/H [**Hospital1 **], goal >21 -Continue PPI [**Hospital1 **], carafate -f/u w/ GI regarding duration of PPI and carafate  # elevated alkaline phosphatase:  unclear etiology, but peaked at 900 on [**2128-9-5**].
Pt has a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube in place, which continues to drain small amounts of bilious fluid.
# refractory AML: s/p multiple rounds of chemotherapy and double cord SCT on [**2128-7-30**].
Pt does require frequent RBC and platelet transfusions.
-transfuse with goal Hct > 25, Plt > 15 -continue ursodiol for [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease prevention -continue prior mycophenolate for GVHD prophylaxis -transition from tacrolimus to cyclosporine today -f/u tacrolimus and cyclosporine levels -f/u oncology recs  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: ==================== - Will need colonsocopy for transverse colon focal thickening once clinical status improves (i.e non-neutropenic)  Medications on Admission: None.
