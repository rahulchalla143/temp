Thoracic surgery as well as a Heme consult were called at that time.
Following an extensive workup which includes ultrasound, TEE, MRA and cardiac catheterization which showed normal coronaries and a large calcific plaque distal to the pulmonary vein, the patient was ultimately scheduled for pulmonary vein homograft repair with excision of the pulmonary artery mass and on [**10-8**], the patient was brought to the operating room.
In summary, the patient had a pulmonary artery resection with excision of a mass and replacement with a 27 mm homograft.
She tolerated the operation well and was transferred from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.
At the time transfer, the patient had milrinone at 0.25 mcg/kg/min, Neo at 1.5 mcg/kg/min and propofol at 30 mcg/kg/min.
Ultimately on postoperative day three, the patient successfully weaned from the ventilator and extubated.
Following extubation, the patient's milrinone infusion was also weaned as were her Neo-Synephrine infusion.
Her Swan-Ganz catheter was removed.
The chest tubes, Foley catheter and temporary pacing wires were also removed and the patient was begun on beta blockade as well as standing diuretics.
On postoperative day five, the patient continued to look well and was transferred to the floor for continuing postoperative care and rehabilitation.
