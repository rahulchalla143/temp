Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right heart catheterization Pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain placement [**2153-1-1**] Right thoracentesis [**2153-1-3**] Left thoracentesis [**2153-1-5**]   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old male with history of hyperlipidemia and GERD, who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital1 **] for urgent pericardiocentesis with drain placement.
A CXR revealed RLL and RUL infiltrates, and his wbc count was 13.2 with mild L shift.
Rapid influenza was negative, and he was started on levaquin, later changed to ceftriaxone and zithromax.
Clinically he worsened rapidly; on the second day of admission he was noted to be dyspneic, cyanotic, with ABG 7.45/19/65, and patient intubated with serosanguinous secretions.
An echo done later that night showed a large pericardial effusion, and decision was made to transfer patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for pericardiocentesis and pigtail catheter placement.
Uncertain PPD status.
Chest: Pigtail catheter site clean/dry, dressings in place.

IMAGING:  Cardiac cath [**2152-12-31**]:  COMMENTS:   1.
Baseline right atrial pressure was markedly elevated with a mean pressure of 30 mmHg.
Successful pericardiocentesis with drainage of approximately 800 cc of grossly bloody fluid.
Post-pericardiocentesis hemodynamics demonstrated marked respiratory variation in the intracardiac pressure tracings, with pericardial pressure of 10mmHg, and RA pressure remaining elevated.
Note: Immunocytochemical studies were performed on cytospin   slides.
The malignant cells are immunoreactive for   monoclonal CEA, cytokeratin 7, and focally TTF1 (nuclear   pattern).
Endotracheal sputum [**2153-1-4**]:  DIAGNOSIS: Atypical.
A few atypical but degenerated epithelial cells present in a   background of pulmonary macrophages, bronchial cells,   squamous cells and inflammatory cells.
Rare highly atypical epithelial cells present, especially in   additionally prepared cytospin slide and Heme slide (1403D;   [**2153-1-3**]).
Note: Immunostains performed on cytospin slides including   monoclonal CEA, calretinin, CK7 and CK20 are not   contributory due to scant atypical cells and high background   staining.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 year old male ex-smoker with hyperlipidemia and GERD, who presented to OSH with multilobar pneumonia, large pericardial effusion, desaturation requiring extubation, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for urgent pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain placement.
He received fluids and his hemodynamics markedly improved after drainage of his pericardial effusion.
2) Pericardial effusion:  On arrival, 850 cc of hemorrhagic fluid were drained in cath lab.
He had a pericardial drain placed in the cath lab that was left in for 2 days and subsequently removed.
As above, the cytology from his pericardial effusion was consistent with a poorly differentiated non-small cell lung cancer, making bronchoscopic biopsy unecessary.
4) Post-obstructive pneumonia:  He was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin, later changed to levaquin for a total of 10 days.
Troponin was elevated at 0.13, however given his normal CK-MB, this was attributed to impaired clearance with renal failure, and the stress on the heart given his effusion and cardiogenic shock.
9) Ventilation:  He was intubated at the OSH, and extubated successfully on his 5th hospital day.
