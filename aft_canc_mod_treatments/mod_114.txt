Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 5066**] is an 84 year old man with history of COPD, dCHF, AF, Aortic Stenosis valve area 0.7, s/p superior segmentectomy of right lower lobe [**12/2158**], transfered from OSH with very mild troponin elevation, transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac evaluation, admitted to the MICU with pneumonia and heart failure.
He was started on levofloxacin for pneumonia, transitioned to ceftriaxone and azithromycin in the ED, then transitioned back to levofloxacin on the floor for treatment course of 7 days total antibiotics, finished during hospitalization.
# Acute on Chronic dCHF: Baseline weight of 214 lbs per son.
[**Name (NI) **] was felt to be in acute on chronic heart failure in the MICU where he was given IV lasix as needed for diuresis.
Patient was discharged on furosemide 40mg every Other day in setting of elevated bicarbonate and limited fluid buildup after two days of holding diuretics, felt to have contraction alkalosis.
# Troponin elevation: Very mild troponin elevation to 0.08 at OSH, normalized on admission, likely secondary to demand ischemia.
He was changed back to ASA 81 (from 325 initiatially) and Atorvastatin 10mg (from 80mg initially).
Most likely due to prune juice/oral medications including miralax per daughter.
This level of elevation unlikely to only be secondary to acute illness, so low dose levothyroxine started at 25mcg daily.
Hypothyroidism may contribute to functional decline over last couple of months and depressive symptoms.
Initially held coumadin because of elevated INR, then restarted.
Warfarin should be continued at 2.5mg daily for 2 more days then decreased to half tab (1.25mg), then back to home dosing of alternating 2.5mg and 1.25mg.
# BPH: Continued finasteride, held terazosin given BP effects.
Terazosin may be restarted and uptitrated back to home dose by PCP.
