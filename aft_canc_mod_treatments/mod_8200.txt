Respiratory Failure/hypoxia due to pleural effusions - Patient found to have large bilateral pleural effusions after aggressive fluid administration during urology procedure.
Pleural effusions were thought to be due to volume overload related to aggressive volume given during urology procedure combined with low albumin state.
Patient responded well to IV diuresis (20 mg IV Lasix) and was able to wean to low-mid 90s on room air without evidence of respiratory distress.
She was not discharged on oral Lasix given that she was orthostatic on exam.
If she gains more than 5 pounds, develops worsening lower extremity edema, or respiratory distress, would restart Lasix at either 20 mg IV or 40 mg oral.
She was found to have positive C. diff toxin and initiated on IV Flagyl.
We recommend continuing PO vancomycin to complete a full course and monitoring her WBC for resolution.
--she was discharged on oral vancomycin every 6 hours for at least a 14 day course (day 1 was [**5-22**]).

She maintained adequate rate control between 60-80 with diltiazem alone.
Her metoprolol and nifedepine were held and blood pressures maintained in low 100s.
6. squamous cell carcinoma - s/p chemo and radiation with evidence of metastatic disease on imaging, with LAD and pulmonary nodules.
Patient was started on long acting pain control with OxyContin and continued on oxycodone prn for breakthrough.
She was also given standing Tylenol.
She should follow up with her oncologist to discuss further treatment and goals of care.
Poor Nutritional Status: Patient with poor appetite and albumin notably was 3.2.

If she gains more than 5 pounds, develops worsening lower extremity edema or respiratory distress, would restart Lasix at either 20 mg IV or 40 mg oral.
- patient will need to follow up with her oncologist regarding her leukocytosis and metastatic disease to address further treatment and goals of care.
- Patient will need to follow up with urology for management of her ureteral stents.
