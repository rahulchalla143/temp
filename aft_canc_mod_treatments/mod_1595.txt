Admission Date:  [**2120-2-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-2-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2049-2-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**] Chief Complaint: Hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old man with CLL, known lung masses and recent brochial artery bleed, s/p embolization of LLL bronchial artery [**1-17**], who presents with hemoptysis.
He was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab [**2-1**] after an extended admission for hemoptysis during which he underwent rigid broncoscopy demonstrating no endobronchial source followed by angiography showing a bleeding LLL bronchial artery, which was successfully embolized.
He was also diagnosed with HAP during that admission, and treatment with vanc/cefepime was begun [**1-28**].
IP saw him in the ED and felt that, given no visualization of endobronchial source at the time of recent scope, it would be more useful to go directly to IR for repeat guided embolization.
They also recommended advanced ET tube to R side to protect his lung, which was done.
He was reportedly hypotensive to 80/50, femoral line was placed, and levophed gtt was started with improvement in BP to systolic in the low 100s.

Brief Hospital Course: 70 year old male with known CLL presents with hemoptysis in setting of known LLL mass; now s/p embolization of bronchial artery with recurrent hemoptysis.
# Goals of Care - After prolonged hospitalization and no clear clinical response to treatment, discussion of goals of care were initiated with the family of Rabbi [**Known lastname **].
[**Name2 (NI) **] was initially made DNR/DNI with no escalation of care, then placed on morphine for comfort and control of his tachypnea, finally antibiotics were discontinued.
IV hydration and nutrition was continued throughout admission until Rabbi [**Known lastname **] passed away on the morning of [**2120-2-26**].
Due to hypotension, he was started on pressors on arrival in the ED at [**Hospital1 18**].
Due to previous embolization, IR was contact[**Name (NI) **] and felt that since hemostasis was alrady obtained, there was no indication for IR intervention.
After completing stabilization in the ICU, he was transferred to the BMT (bone marrow transplant/heme malignancy) unit for further management.
Rad-Onc was consulted and decision was made to undergo radiation therapy to left lower lobe and mediastinal masses for definitive treatment of hemoptysis.
He underwent XRT without complications.
Differential included flash pulmonary edema vs. acute intrapulmonary hemorrhage vs compressive pathology of airways from mediastinal lymphadenopathy/inflammation from XRT vs. mucous plugging.
The patient was diuresed, given pulmonary toilet with albuterol/ipratropium, and was continued on vanc/zosyn.
He was transferred to the unit with quick resolution of symptoms once placed on BiPAP.
Rabbi [**Known lastname 24239**] antibitoics were continued until the day prior to his passing to treat any residual pneumonia.
Rabbi [**Known lastname 24239**] CLL was not actively treated during admission, however, he did recieve XRT for definitive treatment of his hemoptysis.
Metoprolol was held during intial hypotensive episode.
Metoprolol was restarted on transfer to the floor and titrated as tolerated.
# Recent HAP:  Vancomycin and cefepime were continued on admission until [**2-5**] to complete antibiotic course for hospital acquired pneumonia from previous admission.
Transfused 2 unit PRBCs in ED.
Prednisone was continued.
# Diabetes Mellitus Type II - Mr. [**Known lastname **] was placed on QID fingersticks and sliding scale insulin.
