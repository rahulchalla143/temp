Admission Date:  [**2117-10-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-11-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-9-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5547**] Chief Complaint: hypotension, sepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IR - pigtail catheter placement  History of Present Illness: 54 year old female with GIST chief complaint of nausea/vomiting/ diarrea/high fever for 24 hours.
Was diagnosed with GIST (gastro intestinal stromal tumor) a month ago and was started on therapy with Gleevec with the hope to move on to surgery later.
She was found to be hypotensive (sbp 70's) and febrile requiring IVF boluses and pressors (levophed and dopamine).
They drew cultures and started empiric broad spectrum antibiotics (amp/gent/flagyl).
CXR confirmed line placement but did not see pneumonia.
She received ~5L NS total and continued on levophed/dopamine with improvement to 100/50.
She was oxygenating normally on nasal cannula.
started on Gleevec on [**2117-9-27**].
Physical Exam: V: 100.2F HR 125 BP 83/55 RR 22 100%/4L n.c. Gen: awake, alert and oriented, appears somewhat scared and curled up in bed HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric sclera, OP clear, MMM CV: regular, tachycardic, no murmurs appreciated Pulm: CTA-ant Abd: hypoactive BS, softm mild distension, mild epigastric TTP, no rebound or guarding Ext: WWP, no edema Neuro: AOx3 Skin: mild rash vs sun exposure on upper chest   Pertinent Results: CT Abdomen ([**2117-10-16**]): 1.
# Sepsis: Given interventional radiology drained over 1 liter of foul smelling blood from a necrotic area of GIST tumor ([**10-16**]) which is growing gram negative rods, highly suspicious for source of sepsis.
Patient was given fluid boluses as needed to stabilize blood pressure.
Patient slowly weaned off all pressor support, including phenyl ephrine (off [**10-16**]), levophed (off [**10-17**]), vassopressin (off [**10-19**] 0300) - CT abd/pelvis: necrotic fluid filled mass c/w GIST tumor, fluid collection is multiloculated and pigtail catheter appears to be in one of the loculations - With aggressive flushing [**10-19**] pigtail catheter began draining copious amount of sanguinous fluid, after draining a scant amount over the past 24 hours.
- Consulted surgery as feel definitive treatment will be surgical removal of the mass - Cont vanc/zosyn/flagyl as patient is improving from septic stand-point do not feel indicated to double-cover for GNR at this point - Continue to follow fever curve (pt afebrile *24 hours) - Cont to monitor BP, as per family patient hypertensive at home.
Given the possibility of surgery and the patient's continued low blood pressures, will hold on further diuresis at this point - Xopenex q4hr as needed for SOB - I/O: even, to slightly negative - Continue to wean O2 as able .
Initially post-IR catheter placement,pt experienced HCT drop (28.8-23.8)concerning for internal bleed from necrotic tumor mass.
Bilirubin was rising which increased concern for bleeding/hemolysis.
Patient was treated with 2 units of pRBC and 2 units FFP resulting in a HCT 28 which has been stable for the past 2 days.
T-bilirubin began to trend downward [**10-19**].
- given increased pigtail catheter drainage, cont to monitor q12hr HCT .
- Consult surgery for resection of mass.
- cont antiemetics, pt with nausea from tumor - on PPI .
# Pain Control: patient with abdominal pain due to tumor and new pigtail catheter - Morphine IV prn for pain .
- monitor stool output - Ct Flagyl for intraabdominal pathology, not for concern for C.diff.
# Renal failure: Resolved with fluid resuscitation, likely acute kidney injury from sepsis/ATN.
# Nutrition/Electrolytes: NPO for now, replete electrolytes as needed .
# Prophy: PPI, pneumoboots given concern for evolving coagulopathy .
Radical resection of necrotic, perforated,     gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the lesser curvature     of the stomach.
Subtotal gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y retrocolic     gastrojejunostomy.
Drainage of intra-abdominal abscess in the lesser sac.
She was tolerating a soft, post-gastrectomy diet at time of discharge.
She received 2 units of PRBC and her HCT responded to 32 the next day.
Post-op Fever She was restarted on VAncomycin and Zosyn after spiking a temperature to 101 on POD 1.
IMPRESSION: Status post subtotal gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy and removal of previously seen large intra-abdominal mass with air- fluid levels.
She received Adenosine for rate control.
Otherwise asymptomatic and HD stable.
Given 6 mg amiodarone with HR to 110s.
Gleevec 400 mg once day.
Omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)
Hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q3H (every 3 hours) as needed.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
