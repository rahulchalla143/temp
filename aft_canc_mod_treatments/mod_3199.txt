From the nursing home, the patient had a short stay at rehabilitation and back to the nursing home on the day prior to admission where she developed nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
Prior to the procedure, the patient denied recent fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or change in bowel habits.
The plastic stent was left in place and a new wall stent was placed to relieve the obstruction of the ampulla of VATER.
The patient was given Lopressor 2.5 mg IV times one and the heart rate dropped to the 150s.
The patient was given 0.5 Versed, 25 mg of Fentanyl for the procedure.
