The patient continued however to have melanotic stools and required additional blood transfusions although his vital signs were stable and he was asymptomatic throughout.
He was maintained on a PPI drip initially, and then transitioned to a [**Hospital1 **] oral PPI post endoscopy.
Given the refractoriness of his ulcers to endoscopic intervention, he was transferred to the surgical service for surgical intervention.
On [**2131-11-24**], the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, ligation of duodenal [**Date Range **] with biopsy, vagotomy and J-tube placement.
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient was transferred to the SICU intubated secondary to his lung disease, NPO, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and on propofol/fentanyl for pain control.
He was extubated and tube feeds were started.
Neuro: The patient received roxicet with good effect and adequate pain control.
He received aggressive diuresis with effect.
He received diuretics with all blood transfusions preoperatively.
Because of his GI bleed,  he was initially started on lower doses of his beta blocker, however he did not achieve good rate control on  these lower doses, and so he resumed his home dose of metoprolol with effect.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; Pulmonology service was involved in his care and they made recommendations regarding his steroid regimen that he is currently on for his lung disease.
GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV fluids.
