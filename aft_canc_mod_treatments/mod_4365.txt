He reports intermittent cramping abdominal pain with loose stools since increased feeding with via NG tube (replaced [**7-20**]) in the last 5 days since paracentesis and discharge.
Patient developed what was determined to be an SVT to the 150s and was given adenosine 6mg x1 which converted him to a junctional rhythm in the 30s.
Cards and EP reviewed his EKGs and tele strips and diagnosed him with atrial flutter, recommending low dose 2.5mg of metoprolol followed by 5mg with control to the 120s and 2L NS, morphine & dilaudid.
HCV cirrhosis, HCC: - HCV dx [**2150**], genotype 3, presumably [**1-19**] IVDU - [**11/2169**] liver biopsy showed cirrhosis, s/p Pegylated Interferon-Ribavirin x48 weeks, became aviremic but lost to f/u x1 year, no documented SVR - abnl LFTs noted [**9-/2172**] when hospitalized for unrelated illness - AFP [**2172-11-6**]: 14.8 - CT [**2172-11-20**]: ill-defined 5.6cm mass in superior right lobe of liver - Bx [**2172-12-4**]: moderately-differentiated HCC, with broad bands of fibrosis - Not transplant candidate (lesion outside [**Location (un) 6624**] criteria), not resection or chemoembolization candidate (tumor thrombus) - s/p CyberKnife [**1-/2173**] to tumor thrombus - Cirrhosis well-compensated, with evidence of portal hypertension (varices) and ascites seen on last CT scan 3.
Biliary colic since [**11/2172**] (on ursodiol) 4. peripheral neuropathy - he has numbness of the soles of his feet and the tip of his second toe bilaterally, appears to be [**1-19**] interferon treatment 5.
Seasonal allergies 9. s/p knee surgery age 16  Social History: He is married and has one daughter, age 24.
Jaundiced HEENT: Sclera icteric, MM dry, oropharynx clear, NG tube in place Neck: Prominent Carotid pulse, JVP elevated.
EKG: Multiple EKGs include: NSR at 74, atrial flutter at 121, and sinus arrythmia with PVCs  Brief Hospital Course: 1) Atrial Flutter with rapid rate: The patient's rate was initially tachycardic with a rate in the 130s associated with continued discomfort that did not initially respond to 10mg of Metoprolol IV.
His tachycardia improved after a therapeutic paracentesis was performed, but returned shortly thereafter.
2) Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain improved slightly with therapeutic paracentesis but eventually required high doses of dilaudid for pain control.
Once comfort care was initiated he was transitioned to a morphine PCA with great improvement.
3) Dyspnea with pleural effusion: Dyspnea improved initially with therapeutic paracentesis but returned with recurrence of his tachycardia.
Improved with heart rate control with metoprolol and transition to morphine PCA.
After discussion with patient, family, oncology and hepatology, decision was made to transition to comfort measures only and DNR/DNI.
7) Chronic Pain: Initially managed on dilaudid, then transitioned to morphine PCA followed by morphine drip.
