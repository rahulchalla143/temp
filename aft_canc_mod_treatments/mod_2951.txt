Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC placement Pheresis catheter placement and removal  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 35 y/o F with h/o AML M5a s/p MUD in [**6-13**] who returns to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] today because of nausea, emesis, and worsening productive cough.
She was placed on a higher dose of steroids and antibiotics and discharged.
Past Medical History: AML, M5a first diagnosed in [**2134**], treated with chemotherapy and MUD peripheral stem cell transplant in [**6-13**].
She is currently being treated with Rituxan every 2 months.

She doesn't drink, smoke, do any drugs  Family History: Mother with uterine or cervical cancer requiring hysterectomy.
Pertinent Results: Micro (summary): Stool cx [**9-3**] and [**2138-9-17**]: Adenovirus Blood: Adenovirus VL 3900([**9-23**])-> 5400([**10-1**])-> 600([**10-8**])-> <250([**10-9**]) Blood [**2138-9-14**]: MRSA Sputum [**2138-9-14**]: MRSA and Pseudomonas (Gent and Cipro resistant)  .
Imaging: CT abdomen [**2138-10-19**]: Large extracapsular liver hematoma with a large amount of intra-abdominal and intrapelvic hemorrhagic ascites which is highly concerning for active bleeding given the patient's coagulopathy and dropping hematocrit status post liver biopsy.
The absence of bile duct proliferation does not support an extra-hepatic cause/obstruction of cholestasis.
Given appearance and the patient's history, atypical infection such as fungal infections (such as aspergillosis) are a primary consideration.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Patient is a 35 y/o F with GVHD on immunosuppresion now w/ a productive cough, nausea, emesis and acute renal insufficiency .
She was placed on higher doses of steroids and was started on antibiotics given travel history.
She had a total of 7 plasmapheresis treatments (last [**2138-10-3**]) and improved symptomatically.
She was then found to have disseminated adenovirus infection (isolated from blood and stool).
Transaminitis: Her hospital course was also complicated by MRSA bacteremia (TEE negative, treated with Vancomycin x 4 weeks), and PNA (Pseudomonas and MRSA in sputum) treated with Abx.
Hct was 23 post-procedure but she subsequently required 2 units of pRBCs ([**10-16**]) then 2 unitsp RBCs ([**10-18**]) then 1 unit this am ([**10-19**]) and most recent Hct is 21.
Surgery was consulted and recommended conservative management with serial Hct, transfusion support and close monitoring in the ICU.
Diarrhea: Patient has had frequent episodes of diarrhea and restarted Flagyl on [**9-16**] for explosive diarrhea.
Started prednisone 30mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**9-17**], which ?may have improved diarrhea.
Stopped flagyl on [**9-18**] and started PO vanco.
Adenovirus POSITIVE on [**9-23**], started tapering prednisone (now at 10mg QD).
She was treated for [**4-17**] weeks of vancomycin for treatment of MRSA, port presumably infected.
Repeat U/S revealed no evidence of thrombus and vancomycin stopped.
