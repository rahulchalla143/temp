Admission Date:  [**2106-4-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-6-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2052-5-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation and mechanical ventilation Plasmapheresis catheter placement Plasma exchange  History of Present Illness: 53 year-old right-handed woman with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] who presented with increasing weakness and dyspnea.
Mom had lung cancer with brain mets and died at 52.
Two brothers - one with hypercholesterolemia and one with obesity and diabetes.
Micro: Ucx [**4-29**]: pan-sensitive E coli Ucx [**5-9**]: pan-sensitive (except to gentamycin) E coli Ucx [**5-22**]: pan-sensitive (except to gentamycin) E coli Sputum cx [**5-10**]: MSSA, resistent to penicillin BAL [**5-11**]: MSSA as above Catheter tip [**5-11**]: gram positive bacteria Blood cultures 5/28, [**5-12**]: NGTD .
Endotracheal tube tip 1 cm above the clavicular heads.
Respiratory mechanics were performed immediately and she had a NIF of -34 and FVC of 550cc (which is in [**Doctor Last Name 29943**] contrast to reportedly normal values during admission in late [**Month (only) 547**]).
She was electively intubated for airway protection as respiratory failure was deemed imminent given her examination and respiratory mechanics.
She was admitted to the Neurology ICU for further management.
1. myasthenia crisis: After admission to the ICU, a plasmapheresis catheter was placed and plasma exchange was initiated on [**4-30**].
She was also started on prednisone at 10mg every other day with increase by 10mg every three days (at 90 mg QOD on discharge, with goal to titrate to 100 mg QOD on [**6-2**]).
She was also started on cellcept with titration after one week to a goal of 1000mg [**Hospital1 **].
Her mestinon was initially held given that it was felt to increase her risk of secretions while intubated.
2. ventilator dependence: Ms. [**Known lastname 35087**] failed spontaneous breathing trials after her first plasmapheresis sessions.
She was not felt safe to be extubated and a tracheostomy was placed on [**2106-5-17**].
Our goal is to wean her entirely off of the vent as her myasthenia continues to improve.
3. infection: Initial UTI was treated with bactrim for 3 days.
This was thought to be ventilator-associated and vancomycin and zosyn were initiated.
She was treated with vancomycin and meropenem, changed to nafcillin and meropenem after sputum cultures grew methacillin-sensitive staph aureus.
She finished a course of Nafcillin and Meropenem, and had no further fevers or leukocytosis.
Her foley was therefore d/ced and she was treated with a 3rd course of Abx (Cipro x 5 days, [**Date range (1) 14706**]) .
Zosyn was changed to meropenem.
Her plasmapheresis line was discontinued and another central venous catheter was placed.
6. mild ARF: She had mild elevations in her creatinine after she became hypotensive from sepsis; she was treated with IV fluids and lasix was held with resolution of the ARF.
She was not started on iron due to constipation, but this could be restarted after discharge.
