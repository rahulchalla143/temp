Her Echo showed frank tamponade physiology, and CT surgery was immediately consulted and took her for emergent pericardial window in the OR.
After her drain was d/c'd she was transferred back to the OMED service.
She was set up with CT surgery follow-up as an outpatient.
She had a left pleurex placed in the ED as well as drainage of a large volume from her right side via a thoracentesis and began to desat with a wet cough productive of a small volume of frothy, blood-tinged sputum which raised concern for re-expansion pulmonary edema.
She did well and was called out to the OMED service when her above tamponade was discovered necessitating emergent surgical intervention.
On return to OMED, she had exam and imaging finding consistent with significant re-accumulation of her pleural effusion on the right side and underwent R-sided pleurex placement.
She maintained her sats in the mid-high 90's on 2-6LNC (requiring a 10L facemask at one point) with her home O2 dose being 2LNC.
The endocrine team from [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and recommended a battery of tests including anti-TPO, anti-TG, serum aldosterone, and plasma renin levesl as well as continued urine lytes monitoring.
The final assessment of her electrolyte derangement was SIADH and she was treated with salt tabs .
She was continued on her home Exemestane 25 mg once a day.
Surgical course: The patient showed tamponade physiology on echo and was brought urgently to the operating room for a pericardial window with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**].
Overall she tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for observation and recovery.
The patient did require neosynephrine for blood pressure support initially.
This was weaned and the patient was started on beta blocker for rate control.
Pericardial drain was discontinued on POD 4. .
Transitional Issues: This patient had follow-up arranged with her oncologist, with interventional pulmonology, with cardiothoracic surgery, and with the endocrine team at [**Last Name (un) **].

You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation and treatment of shortness of breath.
As a result, you underwent thoracentesis (needle insertion into the chest to drain fluid) and later pleurex drain placement in the area of your right lung.
Additionally, you were transferred to cardiac surgery for a short time to undergo emergent surgery for fluid build-up around your heart called a pericardial window.
You were also found to have mild electrolyte disturbances including low sodium and high potassium and were found to have hypothyroidism.
The team from [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted to help us identify the causes of your electrolyte changes and based on the testing they recommended we currently think you would benefit from taking a low dose thyroid medication called Levothyroxine.
