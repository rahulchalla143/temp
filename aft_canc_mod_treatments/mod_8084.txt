Her GCS per EMS was 3, and on evaluating her, witnessed a systolic blood pressure drop to 89 with respiratory rate decrease.
A CT scan obtained at [**Hospital3 **] was negative for hemorrhage or acute process (comfirmed upon [**Hospital1 18**] review), but because she was intubated [**Hospital1 487**] reported inability to obtain a clear exam to warrant tPA administration.
She arrived intubated and sedated at [**Hospital1 18**] ED, with right-sided weakness when weaned off of sedation.
She was started on tPA and taken to the neurointerventional suite where intraarterial tPA was administered.
Past Medical History: - HTN - chronic back pain - tripped down stairs 1 month ago resulting in L shoulder fx - Thyroid cancer s/p lobectomy - COPD - chronic leukocytosis  Social History: lives with husband, independent quit smoking 1 year ago  Family History: no history of neurologic diseases  Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.0  P: 68  R: 20  BP: 110/62 SaO2: 98% on ETT General: somnolent, intubated, even off sedation, slow to arouse to sternal rub HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, ETT in place Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.

Enteric catheter terminates in the distal esophagus and should be advanced.
Brief Hospital Course: Neuro: The patient presented with sudden onset aphasia and right sided weakness at approximately 1730 on [**2115-6-5**].
Patient transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]; OSH concerned with administering thrombolytics in setting of sedated patient without conclusive exam.
Emergent CT/CTA performed revealing left MCA clot at bifurcation with perfusion mismatch consistent with territory stroke.
Thrombolytics were administered at [**2111**] on [**6-5**] and patient sent to interventional suite where intraarterial thrombolytics were administered.
The patient was seen to have failed several speech and swallow evaluations for which her family authorized the placement of a PEG tube, accomplished on [**6-13**].
During this procedure, anesthesia noted a traumatic intubation and as a result the patient could not be immediately extubated and required mechanical ventilation in the ICU with plans to attempt later extubation.
The patient was sedated with seroquel and propofol for a short course and was able to be successfully extubated on [**6-16**], at which point repeat neurologic evaluation revealed her to remain globally aphasic with minimal responsiveness to command, but showed increased strength in her right extremities.
She was placed on long term EEG monitoring.
We did start lower doses of her home antihypertensives after the acute post-stroke period and titrated up for goal blood pressure less than 140.
Heme: The patient was noted to have anemia with hematocrit to the mid-low 20s so CT abdomen and pelvis was obtained to assess for source of bleed but none was noted.
They felt the patient's leukocytosis and thrombocytosis are most likely reactive, perhaps due to continued aspiration while she was in the hospital.
ID: A urine culture was obtained grew enterococcus requiring a course of Amoxicillin therapy.
Endocrine: The patient was covered with sliding scale insulin, and an HgB A1c was obtained measuring 5.6%.
GI: The patient was started on prophylaxis against gastroesophageal acid reflux and after several failed attempts at swallow evaluation, a PEG tube was placed for enteral feeding successfully.

You were continued on Aspirin for stroke protection.
Your cholesterol was 77 You were continued on a statin.
You were checked for blood glucose control with a HgB A1c.
Because you were unable to swallow safely you received nutrition through a tube in your mouth and then a PEG tube was placed directly in your stomach through the skin.
You need to continue your blood pressure control.
