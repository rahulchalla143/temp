He also recounted that he had a history of a number of months, including several admissions to [**Hospital3 1196**] for GI bleeding at which time at one point he required 6 units of packed red blood cells which finally became quiescent.
His medications on admission included digoxin 0.125 p.o., metoprolol  25, and Lipitor 10.
IMPRESSION:  Dr.[**Name (NI) 6275**] impression at the time of his office evaluation was carcinoma of the sigmoid colon, residual carcinoma, following polypectomy with a return, he would be admitted to hospital for sigmoid resection.
On [**2179-4-13**] he underwent an operation.
The procedure performed was rectosigmoid resection with coloproctostomy, intraoperative sigmoidoscopy was performed.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
He was using a PCA well, no flatus was reported on the night of the operation.
The patient was on telemetry and the patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] on rounds and he was doing quite well.
Their assessment was that the patient was a 78-year-old status post sigmoid colectomy who presented, that he was doing well, was ambulating, and needed follow up for transfer training and functional mobility and improved endurance.
Disposition by the urologic staff, was to leave the Foley catheter indwelling and was planned to book a cystoscopy several weeks after discharge and the patient was to begin Flomax to help aid with voiding after catheter was to be removed.
He was placed on maintenance IV.
He was out of bed and using incentive spirometry.
Dentures were removed and given to the RN and a rapid sequence intubation was used, passed easily through the vocal cords.
The patient was intubated and the patient was transferred to the ICU.
After intubation the patient's oxygen saturation rose to approximately 97 %.
A- line was started and the patient was started on Levophed for hemodynamic support .The patient's ABG at the time of preparation for intubation was 7.34, 91, 27, 15, with a base deficit of 9.
That was after intubation and CVL.
There was concern for potential rupture, as for Vascular Surgery was notified and discussion undertaken about the possibility.
Cardiology came and saw the patient, because the patient had acutely developed tachycardia, respiratory distress, and had continued to be hypotensive despite Levophed with blood pressure 73/88 in the ICU on pressor medications.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**], the attending surgery staff, evaluated the patient, gathered all the appropriate information and realized the patient was on pressors and his abdomen was distended and he had guarding and rebound and he wrote that barring some other septic foci which is not apparent at this time, it was likely that an anastomotic leak was the cause and recommended emergent exploration.
The procedure was an exploratory laparotomy  with a wash out and the patient was left with a left transverse colectomy and ostomy and drains were placed x4 and the abdomen was left open.
Discussion was that the patient would need more volume for resuscitation, add fluconazole, and given albumin.
On [**4-20**], postoperative day #7, and take back postoperative day #1, the patient was on vancomycin, levofloxacin, Flagyl, and fluconazole.
His needle was weaned to off and Xigris drip was started.
On [**2179-4-20**], the patient was prepped and draped and additional large-bore access was performed.
A right subclavian Cordis catheter was placed with Seldinger technique without difficulty.
Procedure performed was an exploratory laparotomy and completion total colectomy, abdominal washout, omentectomy, and end ileostomy creation.
The patient continued to deteriorate from a septic shock due  to the leak from his anastomosis characterized by overwhelming sepsis, metabolic lactic acidosis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and the patient's metabolic acidosis could no longer be compensated despite bicarb drips and boluses.
Per family's wishes no DC cardioversion or compressions were initiated and the patient was pronounced.
