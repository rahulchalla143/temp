This confusion continued for a couple of hours (he again knew her but did not know how to find the bathroom from the garage), during which time they had called his transplant surgeon at [**Hospital1 18**] and made arrangements to come in for evaluation.
The pt's wife reported only soft, loose stool that he has had since starting tube feeds in [**Month (only) 547**].

His chevron incision is well-healed with staples in place.
He was placed on Keppra IV for seizure prophylaxis along with Ativan 2 mg IV prn for seizures lasting > 5 minutes or more than 3 seizures per hour and received EEG.
Neurology recommended repeat EEG to evaluate focality initially documented and determine if Keppra should be continued.
Immunosuppression - prednisone and MMF continued, FK held until HD 2.

Rectal tube was additionally placed due to copious output per rectum.
Nasointestinal feeding tube placed [**9-10**] for nutritional support.
Nutrition has recommended increasing tube feed goal to 45 cc/hour.
He was started on Remeron as well as he has been evaluated by our Psych service and has been followed by the Transplant social worker who have found him to be depressed and have recommended the initiation of Ritalin in addition to the Remeron that was started on [**9-23**].
The Ritalin does have a risk of lowering seizure threshold, so we have elected not to start Ritalin at this time.
There was concern for a biloma and a drain was placed.
About 250 cc of yellow clear fluid was removed and the drain was left in place.
Drain output was low, the repeat CT showed interval improvement so the drain was removed.
Fevers defervesced, antibiotics that had been started empirically were discontinued.
His testosterone level was found to be low and he was started on a transdermal patch.
He was started on low dose aspirin due to his thrombocytosis.
