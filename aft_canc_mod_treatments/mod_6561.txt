Our Interventional Pulmonary team performed a bronchoscopy and determined that the stent should be left in place, and a CT scan was done to confirm placement.
While you were here you developed an episode of fast heart rate called a Superventricular Tachycardia which was controlled with an extra dose of your home metoprolol.
