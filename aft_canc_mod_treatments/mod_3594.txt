Metastatic Kaposi's sarcoma, no skin lesions, Stage IIIB, plan to proceed with Cytoxan, vincristine, Doxil, and prednisone along with Rituximab 4.
G6PD deficiency 11.
ET tube in place.
Mild increased metabolic activity seen in the lymph nodes of the paraaortic, left and right hilar, and subcarinal lymph nodes.
CXR [**2181-7-29**] Findings most consistent with diffuse pulmonary edema likely due to fluid overload in the setting of apparent anasarca and ascites.
Underlying infectious process such as PCP is not excluded and correlation with initial outside hospital radiographs as well as follow up after diuresis may be helpful in this regard.
He was initially started on broad spectrum ABx given concern for an infectious etiology for his respiratory failure and clinical decompensation.
The patient was eventually weaned off of the ventilator and was transferred to the OMED service.
The patient continued on his HAART therapy and continued to improve until dishcage.
On [**2181-8-2**], he underwent chemotherapy with DR[**Last Name (STitle) 74584**].
He did not receive vincristine [**1-5**] to his liver failure.
Thus far, he has tolerated the chemotherapy well.
He no longer required pressor support for his hemodynamic.
The patient will continue his current HAART therapy and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**] as an outpatient.
He was started on broad spectrum ABx (vanc, zosyn, azithromycin x 1, and levofloxacin).
He was started on a brief course of doxycycline for concern for tick borne illness but this was also D/C.
# HIV The patient was continued on his HAART regimen at the OSH and during this admission.
His HAART regimen dose was adjusted for his renal function.
He was started on Mepron for PCP Px as he has a h/o G6PD deficiency and Bactrim would not be the best choice.
He continued his HAART therapy, and at discharge was given prescriptions for all of his medications.
There was a question of TROLI at the OSH after receiving blood; however this is unclear and a full panel of tranfusion reactions labs were ordered at the OSH.
He has also received 3 PLT transfusions thus far.
As his bone marrow recovered, the patient's counts improved and he was no longer required transfusions at discharge.
He was given aggressive IVF along with diuresis to maintain adequate renal perfusion in light of his recent chemotherapy treatment.
At discharge, the patient's mental status was at baseline and he was completely congnizant of his surroundings.
