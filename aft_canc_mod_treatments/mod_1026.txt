Due to multiple transfusions, he has develoepd Fe overload, and has been on chelation therapy with deferasirox.
He is admitted for protocol driven reduced intensity MUD allo.
The conditioning is to inlcude clofarabine, total nodal radiation and ATG.
He was treated with vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin, no pathogen was isolated.
During that hospitalization, he was diagnosed with HSV 1 outbreak on his neck (no lesions in his mouth or periorally), and was also diagnosed with insulin dependent DM-2.

Brief Hospital Course: 66 year old M with transfusion dependent MDS, D+7 s/p allo SCT, normal pressure hydrocephalus, CAD, HTN and diabetes, who was initially electively admitted for allo SCT with clofarabine, total nodal radiation and anti-thymoglobulin.
His creatinine was 1.1 on admission and rose to > 5 following administration of clofarabine per SCT protocol.
On SCT day +1, he was febrile and started on vancomycin and cefepime.
He remained febrile and was seen by the ID consult team and transitioned to meropenem + levofloxacin + voriconazole.
He was intubated electively for multiple procedures including MRI, VP shunt tap (by neurosurgery), and bronchoscopy and extubated the following day.
He was started on ambisome in place of voriconazole for positive galactomannan on BAL (presumed aspergillosis pneumonia).
He was seen by the neprhology team and started on HD for presumed clofarabine toxicity.
In addition, he became hypotensive requiring pressors for a few hours; pressors were eventually weaned off, although he then developed shock liver and probable DIC requiring multiple transfusions.
His abx were broadened to double cover aspergillus (posaconazole+ambisome), vanc was changed to dapto for VRE coverage, bactrim was added for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 21150**].
He received epinephrine 1 mg IV x 2 doses at five minutes apart.
At this time, CPR was stopped and he did not receive further vasopressors.
The monitor continued to show pulseless electrical activity for several minutes with slowing heart rate until asystole.
