Focal hematoma at the liver RFA site, with dependently layering blood products within the abdomen.
Cirrhosis, splenomegaly, and varices.
Placement of triple-lumen 12 French trauma central venous access line into the right subclavian vein under ultrasound and fluoroscopic visualization.
Decompression of the right-sided tension hemothorax by placement of 12 French pigtail catheter into the right pleural cavity under fluoroscopic visualization.
On [**2155-2-13**], patient arrested, whereby ACLS protocol was initiated along with transfusions of blood products.
12F pigtail catheter placed as right chest tube (1500 cc blood removed).
Of note, at this time, patient had received massive blood product resuscitation related to ongoing hemorrhage.
Patient then brought emergently to OR for decompressive laparotomy (see Op note for details).
In the OR, multiple attempts at line placement in bilateral IJs failed, leading to concern of PTX that required bilateral placement of chest tubes via thoracic surgery intra-operative consult.
A triple lumen femoral central line was placed.
Upon arrival, pt persistently hypotensive - despite continued transfusion of blood products and multiple pressor agents.
Though prognosis was grim, decision was made to return to OR with thoracic surgery to evaluate for large vessel intra-thoracic injury.
Pulse returned and patient returned to SICU for further management.
Of note, resuscitation over course of various procedures [**2-13**] included approximately 70 pRBC, 35 FFP, 7 plts, 6 cryo.
Upon return to SICU with patient on multiple pressor agents and requiring massive transfusion of blood products to maintain volume in setting of diffuse massive hemorrhage/coagulopathy, family meeting was further undertaken with multiple attendings present.
Ultimately patient made DNAR with cessation of blood product transfusion.
