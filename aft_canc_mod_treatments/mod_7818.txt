He received CTX and Vancomycin.
Interventional pulmonology (IP) was called as well as oncology and both recommended IV heparin to treat the PEs.
On the floor, initial PTT was 48 at 8PM and he received a 1300 unit bolus.
Past Medical History: hx of Hodgkin's disease, stage IIA, dx [**2141**] s/p radiation therapy.
Relapsed in [**2146**], s/p chemotherapy with alternating doses of MOPP and ABVD.
s/p splenectomy as part of staging laparotomy.
A PET scan on [**2166-12-24**] revealed confluent FDG uptake surrounding the right upper lobe bronchus and right main stem bronchus, felt to be related to an infiltrating mass versus post-bronchoscopy change (SUV max 14.1).
Additional involvement includes a left adrenal nodule, a right mandibular lesion, a distal sternal lesion, the left sacral body, a lytic lesion in the left femoral head, the right lesser trochanter, and destructive lesions of the T10 and L1 vertebral bodies, which demonstrated possible spinal canal extension.
On [**2167-1-7**], the patient began palliative chemotherapy with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab  Social History: The patient is married and has three children, ages 8, 12 and 16.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 93447**] is a 46 year old man with remote h/o Hodgkin's lymphoma, s/p splenectomy, with new stage IV NSCLC with bone mets s/p 1st round of chemo [**2167-1-7**] who presents with hemoptysis, found to have bilateral PEs and post-obstructive pneumonia.
He was initially continued on heparin gtt for b/l PE seen on CTA.
His heparin was stopped given concern for further bleeding.
Pt then taken for rigid bronchoscopy in the OR at which time blood was evacuated.
Pt then developed recurrent hemoptysis and interventional radiology and radiation oncology were consulted and pt underwent radiation therapy.
Pt also had IVC filter placed as it was felt that it would not be safe to anticoagulate at that time.
However, preliminary read (above) was discussed with family and risks and benefits of anticoagulation considered.
Pt and family prefer not to proceed with anticoagulation at this time.
If pt decides he would like to try anticoagulation again, he would need to be admitted for heparin gtt with close supervision .
Pt recieved a dose of vancomycin/ceftriaxone on admission, then switched to ceftriaxone/levofloxacin, then switched to augmentin and finally to unasyn for the rest of the course.
Pt initially started on vanc/cefepime for potential pulmonary source.
Given this information vanc/cefepime were discontinued and fever curve remained constant (temps of 98 c occasional spikes to 100 to 101).
He was started on [**2167-1-7**] palliative chemotherapy with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab.
He had a total of 6 radiation tx, after which he refused further radiation [**1-6**] esophagitis (goal had been 11).
Pt was seen by vascular surgery who recommended conservative management with thigh-high teds.
Pt started on bblocker but he felt that this gave him a depressed mood and it did not slow his HR significantly at dose of metoprolol 12.5TID.
Pt felt to have likely radiation esophagitis, he was started on sodium and baking soda as instructed by rad onc as well as magic mouth wash and symptoms subsided.
# GIB: Pt had guiac positive stool on week 2 of hospitalization and was started on protonix.
# Insomnia: pt experienced insomnia and was started on trazadone and mirtazapine at night.
# prophylaxis: pt initially started on heparin gtt.
When heparin gtt discontinued, pt encouraged to use pneumoboot on the leg that did not have a DVT, however, pt refused pneumoboot on multiple occasions.
Initially pt and family were certain that they wanted aggressive treatment for his cancer and any potential complications of his cancer.
Given this, they began to refuse certain interventions (further radiation, anticoagulation) that they felt would be uncomfortable for him or that had the potential to keep him hospitalized for longer.
Pt and family plan to continue to consider chemotherapy, anticoagulation, radiation, as well as more comfort-oriented measure.
