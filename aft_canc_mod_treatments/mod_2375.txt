He had had recent outpatient treatment for pneumonia starting [**1-21**], briefly interrupted due to elevated bilirubin.
During his hospital course, he was treated with cefepime and levofloxacin (now day 14).
Got chest PT, lasix 20 mg, vancomycin, and nebs.
Immediately prior to intubation he was apneic and required bag ventilation.
- Treated with six cycles of CHOP/Rituxan with good response, but showed evidence for relapse in [**12/2154**] and was treated with MINE chemotherapy for two cycles.
- [**2156-7-29**]: Nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant with a [**5-30**] HLA-matched unrelated donor with Campath conditioning  - Six-month follow-up CT noted for disease progression.
- [**1-/2157**]: Received donor lymphocyte infusion in , complicated by acute liver/GI GVHD grade IV, for which [**Known firstname **] required a prolonged hospitalization in the summer of [**2156**].
- [**2157-12-28**] Photophoresis was d/c'd due to episodes of bacteremia and eventual removal of his apheresis catheter.
- undergone phlebotomy due to iron overload with corresponding drop in his ferritin.
He has continued with transient rises in his transaminases and bilirubin and has remained on varying doses of CellCept and prednisone which has been slowly tapered over the time.
After extensive workup, this was felt related to an infection and required several admissions with completion of antibiotics in 03/[**2158**].
- [**2160-10-20**]: URI and treatment with course of Levaquin.
- [**2160-11-13**] completed a 4 week course of Rituxan to treat his GVHD.
-In [**5-/2161**], noted to have tiny echogenic nodule on abdominal [**Year (4 digits) 950**].
MRI of the liver also showed this nodule but was not as concerning on review and he is due to have a repeat MRI imaging in early [**Month (only) **].
He has been on a low dose beta blocker as well as simvastatin, which was started on [**2161-7-7**] to help with medical management of his varices.
This has essentially resolved over time - Issues with weight loss (followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]); multiple tests done with no etiology found; question malabsorption related to GVHD - Has on and off respiratory infections and has been treated with antibiotics with possible pneumonia.
Grade 4 Acute GVHD of GI/liver following DLI with GI bleed, chronic transaminitis, portal HTN with esophageal varices (not able to band) 3.

Post intubation with some posturing and tremors of RUE in particular, ?tacro effect.
Tip of the new tracheostomy tube is just a few millimeters above the carina, probably not optimal.
Feeding tube ends in the stomach.
Right PIC line ends in the upper right atrium.

Therefore, although vanc, levo, and cefepime were continued, pt was started on methylprednisolone 50mg IV Q12H.
After discussion with his oncologist and the primary medical team, CT surgery was consulted for tracheostomy and GI was consulted about placing a PEG tube.
PEG and trach placement was tentatively scheduled for [**2162-2-26**] but the patient's condition improved and he was extubated on the morning of [**2162-2-26**].
He intermittently required NIPPV for respiratory fatigue but in general his ABGs were reassuring enough for him to remain on oxygen supplementation alone.
He was kept on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage and was switched to Meropenem when BAL cultures showed Klebsiella pneumoniae sensitive to this antibiotic.
He was able to tolerate breathing without ventilatory support for 1.5 hours by [**2162-3-14**], but otherwise was on pressure support, with a PSV of 12 and PEEP of 5.
He completed an 8 day course of meropenem on [**2162-3-15**].
[**Date Range 3242**] was consulted and recommended that we check CT sinus, CT chest, and start empiric antibiotic treatment with vanc/cefepime/voriconazole.
The patient was started on this antibiotic with resolution of his fevers.
Just prior to discharge, the patient thought he may have aspirated some contents of his NG tube which had been dislodged overnight.
A new Dobhoff was placed by IR on [**3-10**].
C. difficile toxin was negative x 2, and vancomycin was stopped on [**2162-3-12**], with no further fevers.
He was started empirically on po vanco, per [**Month/Year (2) 3242**] recomendations, and stopped once C. Diff toxin was negative.
Normotensive prior to intubation but had some prolonged low BPs most likely secondary to positive pressure effects and sedation.
Neosynephrine quickly weaned off.
# Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p allo [**Month (only) 3242**]: Most recent PET scan with no evidence of recurrent disease and he remains in remission.
Respiratory plan as above, prednisone and MMF per above, PPx with bactrim DS and Acyclovir.
Levothyroxine 125 mcg daily M-Saturday was continued.
Metoprolol restarted at 12.5 mg PO BID.
# Nutrition: Patient was advanced to a regular diet with supplemental Ensure on [**2162-2-26**] after extubation.
A Dobhoff was placed by IR on [**3-10**] as patient was unable to keep up with adequate po intake for caloric needs.
He will require tube feeds based on nutrition recommendations until he is able to maintain adequate po intake.
