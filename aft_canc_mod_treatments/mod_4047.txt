Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 81-year-old female status post fall and hip fracture about a week ago, after which she had been placed on lovenox for prophylaxis, and subsequently developed an acute on subacute and chronic subdural hematoma with significant midline shift and mass effect.
She was intubated, given aggressive hydration and begun on pressors.
The risks and benefits of surgery were discussed, and the family decided to proceed with an urgent craniectomy for evacuation of the subdural hematoma.
The patient was identified and taken to the operating room already intubated, and the surgery was performed without intraoperative complications.
Her kidneys deteriorated, and a subsequent chest x-ray following swan-ganz catheter placement showed possible pneumothoraces.
