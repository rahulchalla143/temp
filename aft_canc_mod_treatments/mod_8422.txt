1) Fevers: Patient has been intermittently febrile since admission and overall picture concerning for underlying infection vs. malignancy given pulmonary, liver, and splenic lesions, ?BM infiltrative process leading to pancytopenia.
For now, continue coverage with Vancomycin for positive blood culture on [**1-17**], source probably line infection.
Will complete 2 week course of Vancomycin on [**2-1**].
Also, persistently colonized with E. Coli on sputum cultures, but has received several courses of antibiotics, including Ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin/tazobactam.
Meropenem was started empirically for a seven day course (to be completed on [**2-1**]) but pt continued to spike through this medication.
She was started on a heparin gtt which was stopped due to thrombocytopenia and positive HIT assay.
Continues to have difficulties with weaning on pressure support ventilation, with RSBI consistently greater than 200. .
of drug fever was proposed so RIPE was held for three days, pt given STM/levaquin instead of rifampin, but she continued to spike.
She has received treatment continuously since [**12-22**] (>2 weeks) and has no clinical symptoms of TB at this time.
HIT positive and all heparin products discontinued.
6) ARF: Creatinine elevated to 1.6 (up from 1.2; baseline 0.9 - 1.0).
Likely prerenal although concern for amphotericin effect.
Well controlled on glargine and humalog ISS.
