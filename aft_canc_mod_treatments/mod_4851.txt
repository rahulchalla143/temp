Patient presented for direct admit for stent placement but CT scan showed pericardial effusion and pulsus was reportedly measured on the floor to be 15-20.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
[**5-18**]: reduction in mass, persistent subtotal central occlusion of LUL bronchus, reduction in constriction of pulmonary artery to the LUL and reduction in central adenopathy, reexpansion of LUL.

A central airway stent is visible.
Brief Hospital Course: 65yo M with metastatic SCLC admitted for tracheal stent placement, found to have pericardial effusion with concern for early tamponade physiology on TTE, hemodynamically stable now.
A drain was kept overnight, with drainage overnight.
After multiple hours of no output, the drain was pulled.
# Small Cell Lung CA: He is undergoing palliative measures as an outpatient.
He was admitted for elective tracheal stenting.
He was very sedated after the procedure, and required intubation overnight, for airway protection post procedurally.
Metastatic disease also on the differential.
Treatment was started with Levaquin for postobstructive pneumonia.
# Follow-up: Mr. [**Known lastname 88214**] has a few pending labs that will need to be followed-up by his primary care physician or [**Name9 (PRE) 269**] service and faxed to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 64198**]:  Blood cultures - no growth to date Respiratory culture - no growth to date Broncoalveolar lavage fluid cultures - no growth to date  Medications on Admission: Megace ES 625mg prn Atenolol 25mg QD aspirin 325 prn mucinex 600mg prn guaiatussin AC 20-200 prn  Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: angels visiting nurse  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Left main bronchus obstruction Small cell lung cancer Pericardial effusion  Secondary: HLD Alcoholism Hepatitis C   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to have a procedure called a pulmonary stenting.
You had a procedure called a pericardiocentesis.
You tolerated the procedure well.
You required intubation (a breathing tube) overnight to help you rest and breath.
On discharge you were doing well, and your breathing was improved.
However, you may need oxygen at home to help you breathe better.
You should continue to take antibiotics for a total 10-day course, for what we believe may be a pneumonia.
We have made the following changes to your medications: 1) START Levofloxacin 750mg daily until [**2180-12-10**] 2) STOP atenolol and aspirin, until advised to restart by your physicians 3) START Percocet at night as needed for pain.
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO NOT DRIVE WHILE TAKING A SEDATING MEDICATION LIKE THIS.
