Pt has history of severe Chron's complicated by ostomy placement and multiple surgeries for enterocutaneous fistulas.
Pt had recent ICU admission one month ago for abdominal cellulitis after presenting with abdominal pain and rash/cellulitis, was treated with cipro/flagyl.
Went home off antibiotics but nausea/vomiting/diarrhea persisted.
1 wk ago was started on cipro/flagyl as outpatient.

Surgery saw the patient and felt this was unlikely to be nec fasc Pt was started on vanc/zosyn/clinda with plan for IR drainage in the AM.
Colostomy noted to have diarrhea.
For hypotension she received 4L NS with good effect up to low 100s systolic For her elevated INR of 4.9 she was given 10mg IV vit K. Received at total 400mcg fentanyl in several 50mcg q1hr doses for abdominal pain.
On arrival to the ICU, pt c/o severe abdominal pain, was given 50mcg fentanyl with plan to transition to IV morphine.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

Ostomy bag located in right lower quadrant with bright light green liquid stool no blood.
Discharge Exam: Normal Vitals Abdomen with colostomy bag surrounding midline fistula.
Colostomy in RLQ.
A suitable point for percutaneous catheter placement was identified slightly to the right of midline to avoid the adjacent ostomy.
A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 18**] protocol.
The tract was dilated using a 7 French fascial dilator and an 8 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] pigtail catheter was then advanced into the fluid collection with the pigtail formed.
A sterile dressing was applied and the catheter was secured using adhesive StatLock device ( the catheter was not sutured given the surrounding cellulitis).
Overall, the patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no early complications.
The patient was then transferred in stable condition to the ICU for further post-procedure monitoring.
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated placement of an 8 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] pigtail catheter into the complex air and fluid-containing anterior abdominal wall collection.
Overall, the patient tolerated the procedure well with no early complications.
It demonstrates dependent air and an 8 French catheter noted in situ.
Visualized portion of the liver, gallbladder, kidneys, retroperitoneum, and bowel are unremarkable.
The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure were explained to the patient and written informed consent was obtained.
A pre-procedure timeout was performed using three patient identifiers.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7648**] wire was advanced into the pre-existing 8 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheter and its placement within the collection was verified under CT fluoroscopic guidance.
A 10 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheter was then placed over the [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire and its position was confirmed with fluoroscopic guidance.
The catheter was then left on suction drainage and was secured.
Moderate sedation was provided by the radiology nursing staff using divided doses of midazolam 1.5 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg with a total intraservice time of 10 minutes.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.

Initially concern for necrotizing fasciitis and she was started on vanc/zosyn and clindamycin.
Clindamycin was DCd as there was progressively lower suspicion for nec fasc.
Transferred from the ICU to the floor on [**5-24**] after she had a perc drain placed.
Repeat CT and colonoscoyp confirmed this.
She had an upsizing of her drain on [**5-29**].
However, following this procedure the patient had leakage around the drain and thus the general surgery team exchanged this drain at the bedside.
A Coloplast pouch has been placed over the drain site and is intact.
I have contact[**Name (NI) **] her ostomy supplier and ordered her more of the Coloplast pouches.
MCV is chronically in low 100s suggesting a large component of this is nutritional deficiency which seems logical in setting of diverting ileostomy and diarrhea.
On warfarin at home.
Received 10mg IV vit K with INR down to 1.9 the following morning.
Prior to IR drainage of abscess she was given 1u FFP.
Prior to discharge the patients INR was 1.6 and she was continued on Warfarin.
Decreased with fluid resuscitation and treatment of infection .
# Atrial Fibrillation: rate around 100s.
Digoxin was continued while home dilt and metop were held initially in setting of hypotension.
#DMII - on metformin at home and insulin lantus + SSI humalog.
Has not been taking insulin consistently at home over the last month as she has had decreased po intake.
Was placed on SSI to determine basal insulin needs.
Metformin was held as pt required contrast for CT guided abscess drainage.
Patient restarted on home meds at discharge.
Maintained on albuterol nebs prn with good effect.
