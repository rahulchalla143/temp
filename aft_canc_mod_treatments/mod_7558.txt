If he becomes short of breath, he should drain the catheter rather than increasing his oxygen requirement to relieve his symptoms.
Can drain as often as once daily, but will need to monitor closely for hypovolemia if he is requiring daily drainage.
Drainage should be stopped is patient experiences chest pain.
