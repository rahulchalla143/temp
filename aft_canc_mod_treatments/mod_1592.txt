Admission Date:  [**2193-2-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2193-2-14**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: SOB, chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization w/ [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5175**] to LMCA, LAD and LCx IABP placement Swan-Ganz catheter placement Intubation and mechanical ventilation R IJ placement  History of Present Illness: 82 yo F with known CAD (details unknown) who is reported to have developed SOB without chest pain/pressure on [**2193-2-7**] p.m. although with GERD like symptoms.
The patient was taken to [**Hospital 487**] Hospital and given lasix and SL nitro on arrival.
Given LBBB and hypotension there was concern for ACS for which the patient was given a 25cc bolus of integrillin with subsequent gtt, Heparin, Plavix 300mg, ASA and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath.
In the cath lab the patient was noted to have pressure of 60/48 for which she was started on double pressor therapy with Dopamine gtt (13mcg/kg/min) and Levophed (12mcg/min) with an ABG notable for 7.13/53/86 on AC 100%, PEEP 2.5 600 x 12. .
In the cath lab Right heart cath was performed with the following pressures: RA 26 ; RV 63/25 ; PCWP 46 ; PA 66/44/54 with hemodynamic measurements revealing a CO of 4.26 and CI 1.96 on pressors.
CT surgery was consulted given the extensive CAD but did not feel the patient was an operative candidate given the hypotension, acidosis and poor distal targets.
Repeat Right cath pressures after intervention revealed CO of 6.21 with CI of 2.91 on Pump and 10 Dopamine.
The patient was bolused with 150mg amiodarone and 100mg Lidocaine and initially continued on lido gtt which was discontinued on transfer to the floor.
Hypoactive bowel sounds Ext: Right groin: IABP line in place, dressing saturated with sanguinous fluid Left groin: Dressing in place over swan and a-line - mod/severely stained with sanguinous fluid.
Pertinent Results: Labs on admission: WBC 16.0, Hct 32.8, MCV 88, Plt 183# (DIFF: Neuts-66 Bands-1 Lymphs-11* Monos-10 Eos-0 Baso-0 Atyps-11* Metas-0 Myelos-0 Other-1 Hypochr-1+ Anisocy-1+ Poiklo-1+ Macrocy-NORMAL Microcy-NORMAL Polychr-1+ Ovalocy-1+ Stipple-OCCASIONAL) PT 15.8*, PTT 36.1*, INR(PT) 1.4* Fibrinogen 446* Na 141, K 3.8, Cl 110, HCO3 17, BUN 28, Cr 1.2, Glu 176 ALT 24, AST 93*, LD(LDH) 773*, AlkPhos 69, TBili 0.8 Calcium 7.9*, Phos 3.7, Mg 1.7 ABG: 7.09/46/81 (on vent Vt 600, FiO2 100%) Lactate 7.7* freeCa 1.16 .
Intra aortic was placed with improvement of augmented pressures to 121/53 and cardiac index to 2.91.
Endotracheal tube tip 3 cm from the carina.
NG tube courses through the stomach.
CXR [**2193-2-9**]: The endotracheal tube is at the level of the aortic knob and unchanged.
Blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles are identified consistent with pleural effusions.
The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are appropriate sited and unchanged in position.
During cath, results showed 3VD with critical left main disease, and severe cardiogenic shock.
A balloon pump was placed in the CCU for cardiogenic shock, and the balloon pump was successfully removed with good hemodynamic control.
The patient remained sedated and intubated, so whether the patient was experiencing CP or symptoms could not be assessed.
[**Name13 (STitle) **] was maintained on dopa and IABP in the CCU.
Dopamine was switched to levophed because of signs of sepsis, and was gradually weaned off.
Because of signs of sepsis, the IABP and PA catheter were removed, and an IJ line was used for CVP monitoring, which was kept around 12.
Swan-Ganz was placed in the CCU for monitoring.
ARF: Baseline Cr for patient was 1.1, and Cr was up to 1.4.
Etiology was likely multifactorial, due to prerenal state, ATN and contrast nephropathy contributing.
Patient was given antibiotics including Ceftriaxone, Levo, Vanco, Flagyl.
Source of sepsis was not found, and IABP and PA catheter were appropriately removed.
Patient was not given synthroid inhouse because of ventricular arrhythmia early during admission.
The HCP agreed to withdraw care, morphine gtt was started, and patient passed in comfort surrounded by family.
Medications on Admission: Levoxyl 75 QD Lipitor 20 QD Metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] Ranitidine 300 QD Salsalate 750 [**Hospital1 **] Triamcinolone 0.025% [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Medications: Patient passed away.
