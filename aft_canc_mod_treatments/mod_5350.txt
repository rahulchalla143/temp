Admission Date:  [**2145-12-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-1-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2068-10-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2090**] Chief Complaint: bilateral ophthalmoplegia   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 77 yo man with Alzheimer's disease, myelodysplastic syndrome and papilledema admitted [**2145-12-28**] with diplopia.
Patient was given Zithromax x 5 days.
Patient flew back home with his wife for assessment and management of symptoms.
Neurology was consulted and made the diagnosis of [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] variant of guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome (acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy) and the patient was transferred to the neurology service and treated with a 5-day course of IVIG.
They felt his MDS was stable and platelets were decreasing due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, as his titers were borderline positive.
HE SHOULD THEREFORE NOT RECEIVE HEPARIN PRODUCTS - THIS WILL REQUIRE VIGILANT CARE TO PREVENT DVT'S BY OTHER MEANS (boots, exercises, etc).
Heparin products were discontinued.
However, given his fall risk due to severe dementia, and dysfunctional platelets due to MDS, and given the borderline positivity, anticoagulation with argatroban/coumadin was deferred, as the risk of bleeding was considered substantial.
He was put on IVF with subsequent improvement.
