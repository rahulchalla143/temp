Pelvic lymph node dissection   History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 75 year-old gentleman who has been followed for nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer for several years.
He has received 2 rounds of intravesical therapy including BCG, alpha interferon, gemcitabine and Adriamycin.
Patient subsequently underwent cystoscopy and bladder biopsy.
Given that risk factor the patient was counseled as to the risks and benefits of surgery versus watchful waiting and the decided to opt for surgical intervention prior to development of muscle invasive disease.
Chest: CTABL CV: RRR S1S2 Abd: Midline incision with steri strips covering incision.
