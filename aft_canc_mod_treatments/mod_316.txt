Admission Date:  [**2129-5-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-5-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-7-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cefepime / Latex / Mycostatin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**] Chief Complaint: hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 56 woman with [**Location (un) 5622**] chromosone positive ALL in remission presented to clinic with fever to 103 and BP 92/58.
She  underwent induction therapy with daunorubicin, vincristine, l- asparaginase, and prednisone and responded well.
Recently, she has been on velcade and cytoxan, with most recent dose 4/9.
It showed ground glass opacities and she then underwent a bronchoscopy that was unrevealing.
In clinic, she was given 100mg IV hydrocortisone, Ertapenem 1gm IV, tylenol 650mg po after blood and urine cultures obtained.
Past Medical History: ) borderline hypothyroidism 2) Osteopenia 3) L fibula fx [**11-4**] 4) Chronic constipation 5) Chronic HA's 6) Right basilic vein thrombosis [**7-6**] 7) Lung nodules, presumed aspergillus, as above 8) Anxiety 9) C. Difficile infection [**7-6**] 10) Contrast nephropathy in [**7-6**] 11) VRE bacteremia [**8-5**] 12) Neuropathy secondary to vincristine 13) cardiomyopathy secondary to anthracycline   Social History: denies tobacco/EtOH.
She received stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q8) and spent one night in the ICU, not requiring pressors.
Although she was not neutropenic, she was started on broad antibiotic coverage, including vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl given her history of C.Diff, and caspofungin.
She was also receiving her standing prophylactic dose of oral vanco and had been receiving monthly pentamidine.
Given the lack of improvement on antibiotics and the negative cultures, the fevers were thought most likely due to either Velcade (last dose on [**5-9**]) or desatinib.
She was started on treatment dose Bactrim and her Fevers immediately subsided (see ID).
ID: ID consult service was involved and based on beta-glucan and CT findings and resolution of fevers on Bactrim, determined that the diagnosis could be made without doing another bronchoscopy.
She was started on Bactrim 2 DS tabs TID and prednisone 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].
She was switched from the Bactrim to Clindamycin Q6 and primaquine 15 mg QD dosing and had been on these medications for >48hrs prior to discharge with no fevers.
The patient was also discharged on a quick taper of steroids from 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] to a standing dose of 10 mg QD, to be continued on an ongoing basis until further adjusted by her outpatient oncologist.
A longer taper of high dose steroids was not considered necessary given her good O2 sats, no desatting on ambulation, and not as much data on this protocol in non-HIV patients.
CHF: The patient's cardiac medications, metoprolol and lisinopril, were held when she presented with hypotension.
These long-term benefit medications could be restarted as desired by her outpatient HCPs.
