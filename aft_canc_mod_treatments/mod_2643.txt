Brief Hospital Course: 77 yo female with history of stage IIIA colon cancer s/p resection who is admitted for restrictive cardiomyopathy suggestive of cardiac amyloid.
Pyrophosphate scan showed update throughout mycardium, suggestive of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis.
She was treated with a lasix gtt, metoprolol, and fluid/sodium restriction.
Case management and social work were both working with the patient and coordinating her ultimate disposition.
This continued to rise during the first several days of the hospital course, elevating as high as 3.1 with anuria, but Cr began to decline and urine output began to improve with aggressive diuresis (lasix gtt).
Patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with IV vancomycin and ciprofloxacin (day 1=[**6-5**]).
Symptoms improved and she was transitioned to oral anitbiotics: PO doxycycline and Cipro, with a total tx of 10 day course for each.
She remained free of chest pain and shortness of breath, and given her [**Last Name (un) **], this was likely due to her renal dysfunction and not a cardiac cause, and so her heparin gtt and plavix were discontinued soon after admission.
She was discharged on Metoprolol Succinate 200mg daily.
# Thrombocytopenia - Patient's platelets initially dropped (200->85) while on Heparin SQ (prophylaxis).
Heparin could continue to be used for the patient as prophylaxis and was used in her port a cath.
# Pituitary adenoma s/p transphenoidal resection in [**2160**] - continued on home levothyroxine and prednisone.
During hospitalization, housestaff reached out to [**Hospital 3278**] Medical Center to perform [**Country **]-red stain on removed colon cancer from patient's previous surgery.
# Colon cancer s/p resection in [**2179-3-7**] - stage IIIA cancer (pT2N1bM0 per [**Hospital1 3278**] pathology report).
Port in place for chemotherapy, though she has not received it until this point.
Superficial masses palpated in abdomen, possibly due to multiple heparin injections but potentially due to abdominal metastases.
PF4 antibodies came back positive so all heparin prophylaxis was stopped but hematology thought that due to the low optical density it was a false positive and that heparin could be used.
Heparin was restarted to keep her port-a-cath open and then also was given heparin subcutaneously for prophylaxis.
We suggest she continue subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis during rehab with a change depending on the results of the release assay.
# Patient's UTI was positive for Proteus mirabilis which was sensitive to ciprofloxacin which she was started on a 10-day course on [**6-4**].
Her last day of treatment will be [**2179-6-13**].
The stoma itself looked clean and without infection, but due to its proximity, her presumed cellulitis was treated with coverage for GPC's with Vancomycin and GNR's with Ciprofloxacin which had just been started as stated above.
Her tenderness on her flank subsided and her GPC coverage was meant for 10-days.
Day 1 of Vancomycin was [**6-5**] and she has been switched to PO Doxycycline with her last day being [**2179-6-14**].
During her second to last night, she had her longest episode which was 25 beats and she was then increased on her Metoprolol Tartrate to 100mg [**Hospital1 **].
The following night, her ectopy decreased, and as an outpatient she was put on Metoprolol Succinate 200 daily.
