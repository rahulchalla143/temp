Briefly he was diagnosed with two seperate primaries last year (lung adenocarcinoma treated with a lobectomy and an astrocytoma).
He was on high dose steroid therapy to reduce the cerebral edema and developed a myopathy which prompted the gradual tapering of his steroids.
He was recently enrolled in the Xerecept clinical trial and his decadron dose was reduced from 12mg qd down to 6 mg qd.
He was recently diagnosed with a right lower extremity DVT for which he was started on lovenox therapy.
Pt discussed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] and given dose of Dexadron (10 mg IV).
Astrocytoma, grade III:  Now, status-post:    - Open Brain Biopsy on [**2171-7-11**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]    - Cyberknife SRS [**2171-10-2**] to left temporal area to 1800 cGy    - [**Doctor Last Name **] + Navelbine started [**2171-10-3**] for 3 cycles    - Involved-field radiation (3.5 wks) + Temodar 12-1/04/07 2.
Lung cancer:  Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma    - VAT lobectomy [**2171-8-23**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] 3.
CVA ([**2171-6-20**]): internal capsule stroke with residual neurological deficits including aphasia 5.
Worsening vasogenic edema and midline shift (subfalcine heriation) secondary to large known GBM.
There is similar effacement of the ipsilateral lateral ventrical, although the degree of subfalcine herniation has increased.
Given this, he was given 10 mg IV decadrom in the emergency room with continuation of IV steroids thereafter.
He was seen by neurosurgery and taken to the OR on [**2172-4-21**] for left temporal craniotomy for tumor debulking.
He was seen by physical and occupational therapy and they felt he would benefit from rehab.
At the time of discharge, the plan was for: - Continued dexamethasone, with taper - Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**] on [**5-5**] for chemotherapy - Monitoring of mental status - Metoprolol was started for blood pressure control  2.
Given the amount of edema seen and the symptoms secondary to this, steroids were increased at the time of admission and were continued; upon discharge, plan was for a steroid taper.
Post-operatively, the lovenox was held for two days and resumed on discharge.
