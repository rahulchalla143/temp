[**8-20**] CXR: The ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carina.
She underwent ERCP and sphincterotomy which was complicated by hypoxia and hypotesnion.
Her post-procedure course was complicated by multiple episodes of melena with progressive anemia.
Cipro was discontinued and vancomycin was started at 1500mg q24h.
PICC line was pulled, and central line was placed.
Empiric treatment with Zosyn was started.
She was bolused 4L NS w/ little response, a CVL was introduced for monitoring and she was started on pressors.

She underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy and removal of two stones.

However, despite fluid resuscitation, creatinine continued to increase to 3.9 on [**8-20**].
# Progressive anemia with melena:  She had three episodes of melena after ERCP with a four point hematocrit drop, but her hematocrit later stabilized at 25-26 g/dl without transfusion.
Vitamin K was administered to correct her coagulopathy (INR 2) and her melena resolved, with brown stools that were still guaiac positive as of [**2182-8-11**].
Coumadin was stopped despite the high risk of stroke because of the GI bleeding.
# Atrial fibrillation:  She was on warfarin at home but this was held at the time of admission because of the need for a procedure (ERCP).
She will be discharged without warfarin because of her high risk of bleeding, despite her high CHADS score, and this was discussed with her family and her home nurse.
Wafarin can be restarted as an outpatient after her hematocrit stabilizes.
OT consult on [**8-19**] for short open splint for wrist, and ROM as tolerated.
