Discharge Instructions: -You were admitted with severe back pain and was found to have dangerous compression of your spine (in the cauda equina, or tail, end) by cancer metastasis.
You underwent immediate spine surgery to stabilize/fuse the bones in your back and take the pressure off your spinal cord.
The surgeons also took bone samples during surgery that suggests you have lung carcinoma.
Your pain was managed, you worked with physical therapy and was prepared for Cyberknife to the metastasis to your brain.
-It is important that you continue to take your medications as directed.
We made the following changes to your medications during this admission: --> START Dexamethasone taper as follows: Dexamethasone 4mg twice daily for four more days, Dexamethasone 4mg daily for four days after that.
