Admission Date:  [**2171-9-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-9-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2149-1-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**] Chief Complaint: mediastinal [**Hospital3 32582**] failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endobronchial/endotracheal stenting  History of Present Illness: 22 yoM with a h/o Germ cell tumor of mediastinum with airway obstruction s/p 2 rounds of chemotherapy complicated by pancytopenia, pseudomonal pneumonia, and pseudomonal abscess at the site of a central line who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital1 2177**] for airway stent placement.
At [**Hospital1 2177**], patient was intially intubated with double lumen ETT for acute respiratory distress and started on APRV ventilation.
Patient had multiple episodes of desaturation requiring intervention with bronchoscopy for better ET positioning.
pneumothoraces requiring bilat chest tubes which were d/c'ed on [**8-24**] and [**8-25**].
Patient was extubated on [**8-23**] but then required reintubation on [**8-30**] due to hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Given elevated AFP (4093 on [**7-23**]) and biopsy of undifferentiated carcinoma, patient was treated for germ cell tumor with neoadjuvant cisplatin and etoposide from [**Date range (1) 73635**].
Patient prophylaxed for TLS with alopurinol, dexamethasone, and IV fluids.
Chemotherapy complicated by pancytopenia and neutropenic fever, requiring PRBC transfusions on Neupogen.
Cycle 2 of chemotherapy delayed due to development of Pseudomonas sepsis and ARF.
However, with stabilization, patient underwent cycle 2 of carboplatinum and etoposide [**Date range (1) 73636**].
From an ID perspective, following cycle 1 of chemotherapy, patient was diagnosed with a VAP on [**7-28**] and was started on vanco and cefepime.
Cefepime was changed to Zosyn when patient's sputum culture was (+) for Achromobacter on [**8-7**].
He completed a 15 day course of gentamicin and cefepime, despite nephrotoxicity as pseudomonas in wound culture was only sensitive to Gentamicin.
Patient was then started on Vancomycin secondary to coag negative staph growing on quinton tip culture.
Also started on Amikacin for Pseudomonas in sputum and urine.
Also on empiric flagyl for diarrhea and elevated WBC.
Tube feeds were held with minimal improvement in diarrhea.
Patient then had temp spike through above broad antibiotic coverage and empiric caspofungin started on [**9-15**].
Patient developed poor UOP and lasix gtt started with poor response.
Patient eventually required CVVH for volume overload on [**8-11**] with 6L removal, and on [**8-15**] with 4L removal.
R Quinton placed in R IJ and patient was started on HD on [**8-17**].
He eventually responded to 140 mg IV lasix with good UOP on [**8-29**] and the L femoral line was d/c'ed to prevent further infection.
Past Medical History: # Germ cell tumor in mediastinum - s/p 2 rounds of chemotherapy # pancytopenia [**3-15**] chemotherapy   Social History: unobtainable.
intubated and sedated.
DR. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16277**]  CT Chest [**2171-9-18**] - PRIOR to stent placement: Final Report CT CHEST REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of patient with known anterior mediastinal germ-cell tumor.
The NG tube tip terminates in the duodenum.
Large anterior mediastinal mass consistent with known diagnosis of germ- cell tumor, which significantly deviates posteriorly the mediastinal structures with subsequent tracheal encasing and narrowing up to almost complete occlusion of left main bronchus.
CT Chest [**2171-9-18**] - s/p stenting: Final Report CT CHEST REASON FOR EXAM:  S/P placement of airway stent.
FINDINGS: In the interval, there has been placement of a Y-tracheobronchial and left bronchial stents.
Tip of an endotracheal tube is 15 mm above the carinal bifurcation of the tracheal stent.
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of tracheobronchial y-stent and left main bronchhus stent.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 22 yoM with a h/o Germ cell tumor of mediastinum complicated by airway obstruction, pseudomonal pna and groin abscess transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for airway stent placement.
- NPO p MN.
Hold TFs - CBC and coags for pre-op work up - to OR for stent placement .
- Check baseline CXR - cont AC support pending stent placement - sedation with fentanyl, midazolam - albuterol/atrovent MDIs .
# Germ cell tumor: s/p 2 rounds of chemotherapy as above.
Currently afebrile on cefepime and amikacin.
Will continue prior antimicrobial regimen for now.
- vanco for staph on Quinton tip - cefepime, amikacin for pseudomonas - caspofungin for empiric fungal coverage - pan-culture if spikes - ID consult if patient remains in house after tomorrow .
- cont wound care per [**Hospital1 2177**] recs - cont cefepime, amikacin .
Presumed secondary to chemotherapy but NPO for now and on TPN.
- cont flagyl - cont NPO - consider checking C diff toxin B .
- cont IV antibiotics - serial abdominal exams .
- cont diazepam, olanzapine standing - cont haldol, ativan prn .
Can increase prn as BP will tolerate - treat pain with methadone, fentanyl gtt .
heparin sc.
No bowel regimen in setting of diarrhea.
