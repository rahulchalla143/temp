She was given 3 units PRBCs with stabilization of her hematocrit in the intensive care unit.
She was also placed on an IV PPI.
She remained stable in the MICU with plans to have push enteroscopy for biopsy after transfer to the medicine floor.
A biopsy was obtained; the final pathology report was pending on day of discharge, but prelim results showed poorly differentiated carcinoma, unclear if adenocarcinoma or lymphoid in origin.
Cardiology was consulted to determine if the patient needed revascularization given the persistent T wave inversions on EKG.
Cardiology recommended no revascularization at the present time, given the presence of the mass in the patient's small bowel and that revascularization would delay work-up of the small bowel mass.
The patient was treated medically with beta-blocker, aspirin, and statin.
The patient underwent nephrostomy tube placement on the left.
The patient's serum creatinine trended downward with placement of the nephrostomy tube on the left, which initially had bloody output that cleared to essentially normal urine with trace bloody streaks by discharge.

Her Hctz was held, but her losartan was restarted on discharge.
HLD: The patient's home atorvastatin was continued through the admission, but the dose was increased in the setting of the patient's NSTEMI per cardiology recommendations.
