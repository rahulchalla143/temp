Both limbs were traversed with a duodenoscope.
A stiffening wire was used and the duodenoscope was able to move nearly to the area of fluoroscopically-noted hemoclips, but the limb was too long to completely navigate with a duodenoscope.
No stent was placed because of free flow of bile and contrast, with no visible stricture or filling defect.
