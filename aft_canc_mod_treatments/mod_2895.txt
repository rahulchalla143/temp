Admission Date: [**2188-11-12**]        Discharge Date: [**2188-11-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2164-12-27**]        Sex:  F  Service:  CSU   BRIEF CLINICAL HISTORY:  Ms. [**Known lastname 59870**] is a 23 year old Haitian woman who presented originally to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2188-11-12**], with approximately two to three week history of mid sternal chest discomfort which had been treated with codeine.
She had had a prescription for codeine which she had taken with her.
Respirations 30s, sating 100 percent on a nonrebreather mask but 91 percent on room air.
LABORATORY RESULTS ON PRESENTATION:  Sodium 135, potassium 8.8, chloride 100, carbon dioxide 23, BUN 10, creatinine 0.5, glucose 92, white blood cell count 14.4, hematocrit 26.9, platelets 720, lactate 1.2, liver function tests pending at the time of admission.
Shortly after arrival, therapeutic thoracentesis was performed.
She was shortly intubated thereafter with confirmation of placement of an endotracheal tube via chest x- ray.
Bronchoscopy performed soon thereafter likewise showed good placement of her endotracheal tube.
Initial consultation by Cardiac Surgery for possible extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was obtained and Cardiac Surgery deemed the patient an appropriate candidate and emphasized their readiness to perform procedure as necessary.
By mid morning, the patient had been maxing out all of her ventilation possibilities and oxygenation was still extremely challenged.
The procedure was performed at the bedside under ultrasound guidance.
In the Operating Room a midline sternotomy was performed and a pericardial tamponade was repaired.
Given the unclear etiology of these lesions and the patient's overall presentation, decision was made to continue aggressive treatment and while in the Operating Room the patient was catheterized per the right femoral vein and artery and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was started.
Over the next 48 hours, the patient remained reasonably stable on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
The patient was started empirically on Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone and Levofloxacin.
While on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, the patient's sedation was lightened intermittently and she was confirmed to be able to move all four extremities.
She likewise underwent daily bronchoscopy and several mucous plugs and purulent material was removed from her lungs.
On [**11-21**], [**2187**], after intensive optimization of her ventilator settings, fluid status and introduction of nitric oxide, attempt was made to wean the patient from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
Over the next two to three hours, the patient required increasing pressure support, maxing out Levophed, epinephrine, Natrecor, Neo-Synephrine and ventilator settings, none of which were to maintain a blood pressure compatible with life.
