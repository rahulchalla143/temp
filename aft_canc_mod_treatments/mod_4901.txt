She has been taking lasix 80mg Qam and 40mg Qpm (recent increase) and was started on O2 at home for hypoxia 4-5L/min.
She had a presycnopal episode last night at dinner table, worsening lethargy, daughter reports that she will make something to eat but then fall asleep before she eats it, desats if O2 is off with perioral cyanosis.
Supposed to have pacer upgraded in [**Month (only) 404**].
In the ED she got 80mg IV lasix x1 and put out 700cc.
Is on 80/40 PO lasix at home.
CARDIAC HISTORY: -CABG: none -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: none -PACING/ICD: Pacer [**1-15**] syncope/block 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Osteopenia Cataract Blepharitis PNA in [**2126-8-14**] SCC skin Basal cell carcinoma scalp s/p excision Pseuophakia diastolic CHF Pulmonary hypertension Detrusor instability Breast cancer s/p lumpectomy and radiation Spinal Compression fractures  Social History: -Tobacco history: None Currently living in senior housing, walks with a walker since PNA in [**Month (only) 462**].
Evaluation is limited given the low lung volumes and the patient's kyphotic and slightly rotated positioning.
There is a single-lead pacer device projecting over the left chest wall with single lead tip terminating in the expected location of the right ventricle.
No visible pneumothorax, but extreme right lung apex is partially obscured by the flexed position of the patient's chin and neck.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo F with dCHF p/w worsening SOB and LE over last 3 weeks with increasing O2 requirements whose hospital course included aggressive diuresis with lasix gtt, pacemaker exchange, and transfer to the CCU for increasing respiratory distress.
# Hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: After pacemaker exchange, the patient required noninvasive positive pressure ventilation to oxygenate properly with hypercarbia to the 90s.
She did not require intubation and was able to be weaned to a Venti mask and eventually to high-flow O2 through a nasal canula.
Her respiratory issues were multi-factorial: (1) large plerual effusion, with a thoracentesis that showed malignant cells consistent with adenocarcinoma and minimal symptomatic relief.
# CHF exacerbation with hypotension: Though she was volume overloaded on exam from heart failure, she could not tolerate any appreciable diuresis due to her low blood pressures, requiring increasing amount of peripheral dopamine for support.
EP replaced the pacemaker, but the patient's respiratory status required CCU transfer and her cardiac and pulmonary comorbidities did not allow for any true resolution of her symptoms despite a well-functioning pacer.
