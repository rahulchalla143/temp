He was initially admitted 3 days after initiating topotecan therapy for small cell cancer recurrence due to diarrhea, fatigue, and anemia.
Patient had been on ciprofloxacin for neutropenic fever prophylaxis.
His diarrhea was thought secondary to chemotherapy, and was treated with symptomatically.
He received a total of 3 litres of saline in boluses.
Although he denied dyspnea or chest discomfort, patient was also noted to have new hypoxia to 85% on room air after receiving IV fluids, and was placed on nasal cannula with improvement of saturation to mid-90%.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended deferring anticoagulation for the moment until mesenteric ischemia was ruled-out.
He is chronically on oxycodone SR [**Hospital1 **] for diffuse pain related to his malignancy.
Endotracheal intubation was performed for progressive respiratory distress.
Post-intubation, patient required escalating dose of sedation, and received 100mcg fentanyl and 3mg midazolam.
Peripheral dopamine was started, with MAPs improving to 65.
With subsequent fluid boluses, dopamine was downtitrated and turned off.
Central venous catheter was inserted and demonstrated a CVP of 7.
Limited stage small cell lung CA diagnosed in [**7-/2199**] ----[**7-/2199**]/[**2199**] carboplatin etoposide and radiation from [**2199-8-6**] ----[**1-/2200**] frontal lobe metastases, S/P whole brain radiation ----[**5-/2200**] soft tissue metastases and started on topotecan #.
Anemia post chemoRx requiring transfusions   Social History: Married, lives with wife and 2 children.
Origin of SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**], and renal arteries are patent.
Due to intermittent episodes of hypotension and lactic acidosis, sepsis was a presumed diagnosis and a central venous line was placed.
Presumed source was pulmonary due to infiltrates on chest x-ray.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and oral vancomycin to cover C. difficile.
Due to concern for ischemia, he was started on heparin and cardiology was consulted.
Ultimately, it was felt that the biomarker elevation was secondary to demand ischemia rather than a thrombotic process and heparin was stopped.
He was given 300mg amiodarone and then went into PEA.
He received several doses of atropine and epinephrine.
