The patient is a 61 year old male with a history of a recently diagnosed by CT scan of the chest on [**2187-5-15**] RCC measuring 15 x 4 x 13.8 cm with extensive metastatic disease including extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, multiple pulmonary nodules, bone mets, ascites, and soft tissue attenuation within the region of the greater omentum suspicious for peritoneal carcinomatosis on Sutent chemotherapy who presented to the ER on [**2187-7-14**] with the chief complaint of lightheadedness, dizziness and increased shortness of breath.
The patient has had a chronic cough since [**11-27**] but over the past 5 weeks has noted increased shortness of breath which he dismissed as he felt better on Sutent (Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor) for his RCC.
His definition of diarrhea is [**1-23**] small bowel movements ranging from loose to watery in nature that began when he started antibiotics in [**Month (only) 547**] for a presumed pneumonia.
Of note, the patient takes atenolol, lisinopril and triamterene/HCTZ at baseline and was taking these until 2 days ago as he felt his BP might be low.
The patient had 2 18 gauge peripheral IVs placed and was given a total of 3 liters of IVF with a systolic blood pressure in the low 100s.
Cardiology was consulted in the ED for a stat echo to assess for RV strain with concern for PE in the setting of dyspnea but it was unclear at the time if it was necessary.
Oncology requested that if his BP resolved with IVF, that heparin not be initiated unless clearly indicated.
The patient had been hospitalized at [**Hospital 42317**] Hospital in [**4-28**] for ?pneumonia for which he was treated with levaquin and had a chest CT which diagnosed the RCC with mets.

Brief Hospital Course: MR. [**Known lastname 3748**] is a 61 yo male with recently diagnosed metastatic RCC on Sutent who was admitted for presumed PE s/p IVC filter because unable to be anticoagulated because of active hemoptysis.
Because he is not a candidate for anticoagulation given his extensive lung mets with hemoptysis, an IVC filter was placed.
Patient failed a voiding trail after removal of foley, so started on lasix and aldosterone to improve UOP and to treat abdominal ascites.
Was sent home on aldactone and lasix to improve abdominal ascites and UOP.
He has RCC with bone, lung, and peritoneal metastases.
