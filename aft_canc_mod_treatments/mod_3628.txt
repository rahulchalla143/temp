# Septic Shock:  Met criteria for septic shock.
On admission patient had central line placed, CVPs maintained [**7-15**].
Patient needed pressors to maintain BP initially.
Initially covered with Zosyn, levoflox and vanco.
Patient was continued on atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 6187**].
Patient was also intubated on presentation, and maintained on AC.
Pressors were largely weaned by HD #3.
He was maintained on a 6week course of Nafcillin for this staph infection.
Infectious disease was consulted and assisted with his antibiotic regimen.
The patient completed a full 14d course of Levoflox for pneumonia.
Once more, the nafcillin was continued for 6week total course.
A [**12-21**] culture grew out yeast and he was started on a course of fluconisol as per ID.
He recieved a full Ophtho eval which demonstrated no ocular involvment.
Planned course of treatment is for nafcillin for total of 6 weeks to end [**1-30**], fluconazole for 2 weeks total to end [**1-9**], and ceftriaxone to end [**1-10**].
Patient initially controlled with boluses of Diltiazem or Lopressor.
Used neosynepharine which seemed less arrhythmagenic.
Amiodarone was tried initially for control, but the patient became to bradycardic on this [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
As patient was weaned from pressors he was begun on a regimen of metoprolol which seemed to control his rate well.
He did ocassionally return to RVR, which was treated with boluses of dilt or lopressor with good effect.
He was then restarted on amiodarone [**1-1**] and responded to it well.
It was felt that the risks of ICH outweighed the benefits of stroke prevention at this time.
Nafcillin x6weeks per ID started on [**12-19**].
His L knee healed well and the staples and drain were removed without incidence.
#Respiratory status:  Patient was maintained on ARDS-style ventilation while on the ventilator.
By [**12-19**] the patient was changed to pressure support ventilation.
On [**12-25**] the patient was noted to have an increasing o2 requirement and a CXR demonstrated a moderate-sized R pneumothorax.
Thoracic surgery was consulted and placed a chest tube.
This tube was intermittantly to wall-suction, water-seal or clamped.
He was maintained on his baseline 3mg of Dexamethasone while inpatient here.
We were unable to contact primary neuro-oncoligist to discuss steroid taper but this should be discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] when he becomes available.
#Anemia/thrombocytopenia:  Had anemia of chronic disease, admitted with thrombocytopenia attributed to Avastin and timador.
His anemia was mild, and did require occasional transfusion.
# Hyperglycemia:  Intitally hyperglycemic in face of sepsis, controlled with SS insulin and resolved on its own.
#R Chest wound:  Con't to drain purulent material s/p removal of port.
#Prophylaxis: Patient was initially on pneumoboots and then Heparin SC, a bowel regmimen and a Gi prophlyaxsis throughout his hospital course.
# Electrolytes:  The patient required extensive repletion of his potassium during his ICU course, often requiring q6hr lyte checks and 100-200meq of K+ per day.
# Nutrition:  The patient was maintained on TF while intubated, and also s/p intubation as he failed his initial speech and swallow exams.
He should continue on weekly LFT checks due to his continuing nafcillin.
