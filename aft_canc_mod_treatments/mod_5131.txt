Admission Date:  [**2158-3-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-6-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-3-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Heparin Agents / Motrin / Phenobarbital / Vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**] Chief Complaint: (1) Planned admission for autologous SCT on BEAM regimen (2) left intraparenchyma bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Autologous stem cell transplant  Left craniotomy and evacuation of hematoma x 2  History of Present Illness: This is a 65-year-old woman with Stage III high grade B cell lymphoma admitted for autologous stem cell transplant on the BEAM regimen.
She is off anticoagulation given her thrombocytopenia and h/o HIT.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: - Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as outlined above.
- Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia - Hypertension - Osteoarthritis - s/p Tonsillectomy - s/p Cholecystectomy - s/p Removal of a benign tumor from her right lower abdomen - s/p suprarenal IVC filter [**2158-2-10**]: Large thrombus (chronic) involving the infrarenal IVC as well as a thrombosis of the left common iliac vein and left femoral veins.
She was found to have bilateral pulmonary emboli on CTA and was started on heparin.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was initiated on heparin therapy and underwent a left inguinal lymph node biopsy on [**2157-10-25**], which revealed high-grade large B-cell lymphoma with immunohistochemistry study strongly positive for BCL-2 and CD20.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was then discharged on Lovenox and Coumadin.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was started on R-CHOP chemotherapy which was planned on a dose-dense schedule with her first cycle on [**2157-11-2**].
Her sixth cycle was delayed by one week due to an admission for fever and neutropenia with completion of chemotherapy on [**2158-1-17**].
Her treatment was otherwise supported with Neulasta along with Aranesp.
In [**11-14**], patient was found to have worsening swelling in her left lower extremity and was found to have heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
She was started initially on lepirudin and then transitioned to Coumadin.
Additionally, she also was found to have staph infection of her finger requiring surgical drainage and antibiotics and a subsequent staph infection of her right toe.
She had a POC placed for venous access but this became clotted and did not function.
She then had a double lumen PICC line placed for the remainder of her treatment.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] underwent a PET scan after four cycles of her chemotherapy on [**2158-12-9**].
A PET scan at the completion of treatment showed no FDG-avid disease.
This, however, presented with some difficulties due to her history of HIT and the fact that there would be periods of thrombocytopenia during her treatment course.
The stem cells could be collected without the use of heparin and her [**Known lastname **] catheter could be maintained using sodium citrate instead of heparin flushes.
In preparation for her chemotherapy for mobilization and stem cell collections and subsequent autologous transplant, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was seen in interventional radiology on [**2158-2-10**] for Port-A-Cath removal and IVC filter placement.
Because she would require periods of being off her Coumadin, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] would continue anticoagulation with fondaparinux 7.5 mg subcutaneous daily.
She tolerated this relatively well with some diarrhea, but developed profound pancytopenia as is expected requiring platelet and red cell transfusions.
She also required an admission on [**2158-3-1**] due to fever and chills.
Her stem cell collections were completed in eight days with over 5 million CD34 cells/kg collected.

Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 65-year-old woman with Stage III high grade B cell lymphoma admitted for autologous stem cell transplant on the BEAM regimen.
(1) Stage III High-Grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma: The patient was admitted for autologous stem cell transplant with BEAM therapy.
She tolerated her chemotherapy well.
She was continued on Ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis.
Her counts were supported with PRBCs and platelets as needed.
In this setting, she was started on PO Vancomycin for possible treatment failure C dificile.
The patient received 9 total bags of stem cells and was found to be approximately 15 pounds up from her admission weight after getting IVFs during chemotherapy and her stem cells.
She was started on Neupogen on Day +4 and continued for a total of 9 days.
(2) Abdominal Pain: As the patient's counts trended down, she complained of right sided abdominal pain and was started on Cefepime/Flagyl for concern of an infectious process in the setting of treatment failure C dif.
The patient was given suppositories with some relief.
She was started initially on PO Vancomycin for possible Flagyl treatment failure.
The diarrhea resolved over a 5 day period with antibiotics and assistance of loperamide.
(4) h/o Pulmonary Embolus and HIT: The patient was diagnosed with heparin induced thrombocytopenia during her inital workup and presentation at [**Hospital6 2561**].
A filter was placed and she was put on Fondoparinux for a period of time.
All heparin products were avoided given history of HIT.
Patient was not treated with any anticoagulation throughout her stay.
Her platelets had a small drop after the initiation of famotidine treatment and this medication was discontinued the day prior to her discharge.
The patient was treated with warm compresses and PRN Oxycodone.
She takes a Vitamin B complex as per outpatient regimen which was discontinued temporarily during her autologous transplant.
Patient was taken emergently to Or for L craniotomy and evacuation of hematoma; her post-op CT was not significantly changed, so she returned to the OR later that same day ([**4-13**]) for repeat evacuation.
She was put on a nitro drip for her HTN.
We checked her daily dilantin level corrected for albumin for goal 15-20.
She was weaned of her nitro drip and started on metoprolol 25 mg PO TID to keep SBP<160.
PT was working with her and her Wernicke's aphasia was also improving.
She was given platelets to increase her platelet count from 70 to > 100.
She was kept on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
Thought to be possible aspiration event, but her respiratory status was not compromised and she continued to spike fevers despite treatment.
Initially this was attempted to be controlled with Dilaudid and Ativan.
She was uptitrated on Keppra and downtitrated on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxys.
Agitations finally improved on standing low dose haldol (1mg every 8 hours) and keppra.
All narcotics were held to prevent further mental status depression.
(9) Transaminitis: The patient developed transaminitis in the setting of abdominal pain, delirium, and expressive aphasia.
Her fluconazole and acyclovir were held as these were possible sources of her transaminitis.
(10) Thrush: The patient developed thrush and was started on fluconazole.
(12) Nutrition: Status post J-tube placement and tubefeeds (concentrated TFs to keep rate less than 40ml/hour; higher rates caused emesis.).
Improved with antibiotics and diuresis.
All antibiotics were held and GCSF restarted.
WBC finally recovered, and GCSF could be held again.
Of note, during the course of cytopenia antibiotics had to be restarted again without negative effect on cell counts.
