The patient had recent admission on [**4-/2182**] when a right bronchial stent was placed.
A tracheal stent was removed and replaced and the patient received Photofrin therapy.
The patient was CT angio on [**2182-5-10**], which did not reveal a pulmonary embolus, but did show tumor progression with compression of trachea and bronchi and a right subclavian deep venous thrombosis.
The patient was started at that time on Lovenox and Coumadin, which was discontinued on [**5-12**] in preparation for her procedure.
Non small cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2178**], status post right lobectomy in [**2178**] with metastases in [**2182**] in right axilla, thyroid and bone.
She is status post radiation therapy, status post carboplatin times six cycles, last cycle on [**1-5**].
Status post Photofrin injection and stent placement in [**4-6**].
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in [**2144**] status post radiation therapy.
Status post total abdominal hysterectomy in [**2165**].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Serevent one puff b.i.d., Albuterol two puffs q 4 to 6 hours prn, Lovenox and Coumadin, which were discontinued on [**5-12**].
CT angiogram on [**5-10**] revealed no PE, but did reveal extensive mediastinal disease with distortion and compression and invasion of the airway with interval increase since [**4-6**].
Small pulmonary nodules likely lymphangitic and hematogenous metastases as well as a right chest wall mass and right breast lesion with skeletal metastases.
IMPRESSION:  This was a 64 year-old woman with nonsmall cell lung cancer and right subclavian deep venous thrombosis here for stent placement secondary to disease progression.
Pulmonary, nonsmall cell lung cancer with increased mediastinal burden, increased shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion with recent right bronchial stent placement.
The patient had a stent placed in the trachea as well as in the left main bronchus and the right upper lobe revealed obstruction in the posterior apical and anterior segments.
The patient was continued on ventilatory support and was followed by arterial blood gas and ventilatory parameters.
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] for palliative radiation therapy to her mediastinal mass for which she received on [**5-17**].
The patient, however, continued to have worsening oxygen requirements as well as had respiratory acidosis and at this time the patient and her family discussed with the attending changing her aim of care toward comfort measures only.
The patient was started on a morphine drip.
Her oxygen level was brought to room air and ventilatory support was continued.
The patient's Lovenox and Coumadin were held during her hospital stay.
The patient's A line did not always correlate with her manual cuff, but her maps remained above 65 until her aim of care changed at which time the patient became hypotensive.
