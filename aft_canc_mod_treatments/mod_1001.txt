He denies other associated symptoms including cough, sob, fevers, chills, doe, leg swelling, nausea, vomitting, sore throat, myalgias, arthralgias.

He does not recall taking bactrim at a ppx dose after completing treatment in [**Month (only) **].
CXR was concerning for multilobar pneumonia and thus patient was given Bactrim DS three tabs, prednisone 40 mg PO, Vancomycin 1 g IV, Cefepime 1 g IV, levofloxacin 750 mg IV.
He was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, osteltamivir, and bactrim.

He is at high risk for recurrence of PJP given was not taking his prophylactic Bactrim and may or may not be compliant with his HAART and known to have very low CD4 (LDH also very elevated c/w PJP).
Was initially on broad spectrum antibiotics (including cefepime, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and oseltamivir).
DFA for flu was negative and oseltamivir was discontinued.
Cefepime and vancomycin were also discontinued as he improved (and in the absence of any discovered bacterial etiologies).
He will complete a 7 day course of levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia.
He will continue on Bactrim until [**1-2**] along with a prednisone taper (40mg [**Hospital1 **] through [**12-17**], 40mg daily through [**12-22**], and 20mg daily through [**1-2**]).
Improved with treatment of pneumonia.
High risk for OI, likely not taking [**Month/Day/Year 33337**] as prescribed including HAART and prophylaxis.
He was continued on his home regimen of Atazanavir, Ritonavir, Tenofovir, and Zidovudine.
Prophylactic azithromycin and itraconazole were continued, and he will require Bactrim prophylactically once he completes his treatment course.
