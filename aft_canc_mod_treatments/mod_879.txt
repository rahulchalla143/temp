HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86 year old woman with a history of moderate/severe aortic stenosis, pulmonary embolism, non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma and status post CVP chemotherapy two weeks ago.
The patient was receiving intravenous fluid and intravenous pain medications.
The patient was followed by the Pain Service and was tried on numerous therapeutic modalities including Dilaudid PCA, a neuropathic pain [**Doctor Last Name 360**], and subcutaneous and intravenous narcotics.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed mild dilatation of the common bile duct status post cholecystectomy as well as a heterogenous liver which was a non-specific finding.
The patient was empirically placed on Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
The patient was placed on Ampicillin but continued to have difficulty with pain control due to the trigeminal neuralgia.
She attempted a nerve block adn a variety of medications for neuropathic pain without success.
The patient's O2 saturations decreased to 50% on room air, increasing to the mid 80s on a non- rebreather.
The patient had crackles in the left lower lobe and she was given intravenous Lasix with 1.0 liters of urine output.
Due to the patient's aortic stenosis, the patient's systolic blood pressures decreased to the mid-80s and she was brought to the Intensive Care Unit for management of her aspiration pneumonia and her hypotension.
The patient was initially volume resuscitated and was treated with Levaquin and Flagyl in addition to ampicillin both for her enterococcal urinary tract infection as well as for the aspiration pneumonia.
All sedative medications were held and the patient was transferred back to the floor.
At that time, the patient had been restarted on tube feeds and the thought was that the patient had aspirated a great deal of her tube feeds.
Low grade lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's Grade 1 out of 3, treated with Rituxan, status post one dose of CVP on [**2-12**]; diagnosis of lymphoma was made in [**2188-11-22**].
Left hip surgical repair in [**2187**].
ALT 25, AST 22, LDH 218, alkaline phosphatase 116, total bilirubin 0.3, calcium 9.6, magnesium 1.6, lactate 1.3.
During the second Intensive Care Unit admission, the patient's systolic blood pressure was extremely low and the family had requested no heroic measures including cardioversion, intubation or pressors.
The patient's mental status completely returned to [**Location 213**] and the patient was weaned from 100% nonrebreather after two liters nasal cannula.
The patient was placed on aspiration precautions.
She was treated with Vancomycin and given Gram positive cocci found in the sputum as well as a course of Levofloxacin and Flagyl times ten days.
Due to her aspiration events, the patient was considered for a PEG tube.
The patient deferred given the fact that her husband had a PEG tube and had numerous complications from it and had died due to the complications of infection from the PEG.
As far as the patient's trigeminal neuralgia, the patient was considered for vascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve as well as gamma knife therapy since the patient had failed medical therapy.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] believed that the patient was not a good candidate for further decompression surgery for two reasons; first, the patient would have to be intubated for the procedure which she refuses, and secondly, the patient would be undergoing the third decompressive procedure and if the first two had not provided significant improvement, the third was unlikely to do so.
Given this fact, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] believed that neither surgical procedure could delivery the desired outcome and these were deferred.
The pain service continued the patient on a Lidocaine drip for 48 hours in the Intensive Care Unit since there have been few studies which have revealed that 48 hours of Lidocaine infusion can cause the trigeminal ganglion be deactivated, resulting in substantial benefit in the patient's pain.
The patient was continued on the Lidocaine drip with substantial decrease in her pain and was able to speak once again.
The patient was also placed on a Fentanyl patch which was titrated up to 50 micrograms at the time of discharge from the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient was also placed on three days of Toradol and it was decided that the patient should not have any intravenous narcotics whatsoever and the patient should only have subcutaneous medications at a very low dose given her age and her inability to clear these medications effectively, and the problem with decreased mental status.
The patient was placed on a beta blocker, aspirin could not be started given her inability to take any p.o.
The patient's intravenous fluids were increased to D5 normal saline at 125 cc an hour with improvement in her urine output.
The patient did not want a PEG tube to be placed and J-tube placements had been considered and tried on the floor, but during the patient's mental status changes, she had a tendency to pull out the NG tube and it was decided that this was unsafe.
The patient was started on TPN and a PICC line was to be placed to that effect.
If this does happen, the family has a strong desire to pursue Hospice level of care and does not wish the patient to have recurrent aspiration pneumonias, and understands that if her oral secretions cannot be controlled quite well with medical therapies due to her trigeminal neuralgia, that Hospice care would be preferable to recurrent aspiration events.
