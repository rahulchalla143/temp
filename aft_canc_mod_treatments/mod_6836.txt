Admission Date:  [**2153-8-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-10-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-10-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: Fever, night sweats, cough  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Lumbar puncture Bone marrow biopsy x 3 Right subclavian central line x 2 PICC line insertion   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 83420**] is a 45 year old female with no significant past medical history who developed B symptoms of fevers and night sweats as well as some cough and progressive dyspnea.
Thus, she was started on levofloxacin and ceftriaxone.
She was hypoxic, requiring supplementary oxygen by nasal cannula on arrival here but denied other complaints.
Her antibiotics were switched to vancomycin, cefepime, and oseltamavir.
After arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] a repeat CT showed similar findings to those seen on the [**Hospital3 **] scan and she was started on hydroxyurea for her initial leukocytosis of 120,000.
Despite broad antibiotic coverage, her O2 requirement began to increase and micafungin was added empirically [**8-10**] for fungal coverage.
She was given lasix 10 mg IV with ~1.5L urine output.
Bicarb gtt was discontinued to improve metabolic alkalosis.
She was noted to have a temperature of 104 and standing tylenol was ordered.
Due to lack of improvement in respiratory status, and also with plans to initiate chemotherapy for presumed component of infiltrative leukemia adding to worsening respiratory status, she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was started on vancomycin and Bactrim and was transfused platelets and blood.
The bronch later was galactomannan positive and the pt was started on voriconazole.
She denied fever, chills, HA, vision changes, SOB, Chest pain, Cough, abdominal pain, diarhea, constipation, or urinary symptoms.

Central lymph node enlargement in the left paratracheal, subcarinal, paraesophageal, and pretracheal regions.
PET and Thallium scans can be performed to further assess.
As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities, predominating at the lung bases, but also seen in the lung apices, show minimal regression.
The visualized heart and pericardium are unremarkable.
This finding is also well appreciated on coronal reformatted images (6:25 and 6:19).
The differential diagnosis includes infections likely fungal given the presence of blood products or subacute infarct which is less likely given the duration of enhancement.
A right central venous catheter terminates in the lower superior vena cava.
While it does appear to be markedly decreased compared to older prior studies, this may be related to differences in technique given that all the other prior imaging was performed at 3 Tesla compared to the current and most recent prior study which were both performed at 1.5 Tesla MRI.
Brief Hospital Course: After arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] a repeat CT showed similar findings to those seen on the [**Hospital3 **] scan and she was started on hydroxyurea for her initial leukocytosis of 120,000.
Despite broad antibiotic coverage, her O2 requirement began to increase and micafungin was added empirically [**8-10**] for fungal coverage.
She was given lasix 10 mg IV with ~1.5L urine output.
Bicarb gtt was discontinued to improve metabolic alkalosis.
She was noted to have a temperature of 104 and standing tylenol was ordered.
Due to lack of improvement in respiratory status, and also with plans to initiate chemotherapy for presumed component of infiltrative leukemia adding to worsening respiratory status, she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was started on vancomycin and Bactrim and was transfused platelets and blood.
The bronch later was galactomannan positive so the patient was started on voriconazole.
On [**8-16**] she developed hypertension with bradycardia and suspicion for [**Location (un) 3484**] triad led to getting a head CT.  Pt underwent head CT [**2153-8-17**] which demonstrated L cerebellar lesion, initally concerning for infarct.
She reached the floor in stable condition and did not have any symptoms of infection including fever, chills, HA, vision changes, SOB, Chest pain, Cough, abdominal pain, diarhea, constipation, urinary symptoms.
She was started on clindamycin and pyrimethamine to empirically treat toxoplasmosis.
A repeat MRI was performed on [**8-31**] to evaluate if the empiric treatment for toxoplasmosis was helping.
Nuerology and infectious disease were still following the patient and it was decided that she would have a repeat MRI in one week to evaluate change in the microbleeds and another MRI in one month to evaluate for change in the ring enhancing lesion; these were found to be stable on repeat imaging.
Ms. [**Known lastname 83420**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8337**] her reinduction with Ara -C well with only mild nausea, headache, and weakness.
She was evaluated by ophthalmology and started on tobramycin ointment, which controlled the swelling.
Over the next several days, her physical condition and respiratory status began to deteriorate and she required a non-rebreather O2 mask to maintain oxygen saturation > 90%.
On [**2153-9-15**], Ms. [**Known lastname 83420**] began her first cycle of chemotherapy with dacogen.
Although her cell counts were slow to recover, she improved significantly over the ensuing weeks, becoming afebrile and no longer requiring oxygen to breathe.
She will be discharged to home with services to receive her second cycle of Dacogen as an outpatient.
She was continued on IV vancomycin (dose was ultimately increased to 1g Q6H when troughs returned low) and converted to IV voriconazole (from oral) and meropenem and IV bactrim (treatment dose of 6 mg/kg) were added to broaden coverage.
After ~3 weeks, Bactim was stopped as it was felt that the organisms uniquely covered by this drug were unlikely pathogens in the setting of a stable patient.
Just over a week after her treatment with Dacogen, the fevers resolved.
However, per ID recommendations,treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics will be continued until her absolute neutrophil count is above 500.
At the time of discharge, she was switched to po Voriconazole and Moxifloxacin per ID recommendations.
GIVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE MEDICATIONS TO CAUSE QT PROLONGATION, the patient should have a repeat EKG on MONDAY, [**2153-10-15**].
Her baseline EKG on [**2153-10-11**] showed a QT interval of 398, any increase >25% over baseline should be concerning for QT prolongation and these medications should be discontinued with resumption of other antibiotic coverage.
Further, the patient should have daily serum potassium and magnesium levels drawn, and these should be repleted immediately as needed to prevent any cardiac complications on these medications.
Microperforation of the ascending colon: The patient was kept NPO and this was medically managed without surgical intervention.
The patient was maintained on broad spectrum antibiotics and voriconazole.

You were started on chemotherapy.
A repeat bone marrow biopsy showed that this chemotherapy did not work completely and you still had some cancer cells in your bone marrow.
You were started on a different regimen of chemotherapy.
A repeat bone marrow biopsy showed that the second dose of chemotherpy was also ineffective at controlling the leukemia, so you were started on a third regimen.
During your hospitalization you also had worsening shortness of breath and required a breathing tube in the intensive care unit.
Your pneumonia improved and you did not need the breathing tube anymore.
You were started on antibiotics to treat toxoplasmosis or fungal infection in case this was what you had.
You should continue to take antibiotics for this until your absolute neutrophil count (ANC) laboratory test is higher than 500 or as directed by your physician.
We have made the following changes to your medication regimen: NEW MEDICATIONS: Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet.
Lorazepam  0.5 mg Tablet.
Folic Acid  1 mg Tablet  Sig:  One (1) tablet daily.
Cyanocobalamin  100 mcg Tablet.
