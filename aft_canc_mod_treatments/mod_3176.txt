He presented to PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**11-18**] and was found to have B basilar consolidations c/w PNA and started on levo (day#3 on admit) without improvement of symptoms.
Labored breathing and SOB possibly infectious (although no cough/fever), recurrence of lymphoma, or progression of bleomycin toxicity.
Admitted on [**2131-11-23**] and treated empirically with ctx and azithro for presumed community acquired pneumonia; brochoscopy on [**11-27**] performed to evaluate for other infectious etiologies or recurrence of lymphoma.
He initially did well post-bronchoscopy but then had an episode of desaturation and hypotension and transferred to the ICU for further evaluation; intubated [**11-29**] for persistent respiratory distress and hypoxemia.
Started on levophed [**11-29**] for persistent hypotension which was not responsive to fluid boluses and antibiotics changed to vanco/zosyn for broader empiric coverage.
Transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] on [**12-3**] for lung biopsy; post operatively, Mr. [**Known lastname **] remained intubated given poor oxygenation; blood pressure remained pressor dependent.
Extensive family discussions were held post-operatively as patient remained ventilator and pressor dependent and following a family meeting on [**12-11**], aggressive care was withdrawn the evening of [**12-11**] and patient was extubated and placed on a moprhine drip.
