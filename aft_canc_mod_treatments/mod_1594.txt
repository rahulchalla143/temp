He was started on levo initially, and vanc/cefepime were added for broader coverage.
He underwent bronchoscopy complicated by massive bleeding from thrombus / mass lesion in LLL lobe which initially required intubation; he then underwent IR embolization of bronchial artery with injection of alcohol into the tumor with stabilization of the bleeding.
# Fever: Patient had been febrile 1 week prior to admission and was treated empirically with Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Cefepime as well as Voriconazole.
For that reason he was started on Vancomycin and Cefepime for HAP on [**1-30**] for a planned 7-day course through [**2-5**].
He should be given Tylenol for fever>101.
# AIHA: Patient has known AIHA related to CLL and HCT 25 from baseline 28-30 with increased hyperbilirubinemia possibly related to hemolysis.
A CXR showed increased congestion and patient received iv lasix.
He was continued on Prednisone.
Given thrombocytopenia, recent bleeding and active CLL, patient is not a candidate for antiplatelet therapy (aspirin / clopidogrel) and this likely represents a demand related event and not platelet related coronary thrombosis, however troponins did increase during this admission, suggesting NSTEMI.
# Pancytopenia: PLT and WBC at baseline.
Patient was given neuopogen on [**1-26**] and [**2-1**] and transfused 3U PRBC during his floor course.
Patient's labs should be drawn twice weekly starting [**2-3**] and he should be transfused for platelets <30, Hct<25 unless he has symptoms of dyspnea/chest pain (in that case, <30).
He should be given neupogen for ANC<1500.
# DM2: [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted throughout hospital stay, he was given insulin sliding scale throughout stay.
