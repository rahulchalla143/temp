You were also on a prednisone taper when you came into the hospital that was started last Friday ([**6-12**]).
However, the steroids were making your white blood cell count high, and was clouding you lab tests and making it difficult for us to treat you.
Please follow up with orthopedics for care of your osteomyelitis.
Please also follow up with your primary rheumatologist for re-initiation of your prednisone taper.
