Left subclavian central venous catheter remains malpositioned  demonstrating a curve and the tip positioned in a cephalolateral orientation.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 year old male with past medical history of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (s/p CHOP, now in remission) who has had weekly tick bites and chronically on doxycycline until two months ago with history of two possible prolonged tick bites with one of them a deer tick.
He presents with two week history of malaise and five day history of high grade fever, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, anemia with possible hemolysis along with hypotension not responsive to IVF resuscitation requiring pressors.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Severe Babesiosis: Thrombocytopenia/transaminitis/fever/anemia/hemolytic anemia with history of tick bite is consistent with severe babesiosis in immunocompromised patient with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p chemotherapy who presented with fever, myalgias, hemoglobinuria, jaundice with transaminitis, hemolytic anemia.
He was treated with clindamycin 600 mg IV q8 and quinine 650 mg po q6 for severe babesiosis as well as doxycycline 100 mg po BID for other co-infections with tick borne illness.
Plasmapheresis was initiated given parasitemia >10%, and this resolved to 2% the following day.
He was initially continued on Levophed gtt to keep MAPs>65.
A left subclavian central line was placed, but curled up and around and was never used to medication administration.
Because of his significant improvement, and the development of hallucinations, he was switched from quinine to atovaquone; clindamycin was changed to azithromycin.
He was continued on doxycycline until ehrlichiosis returned negative, at which time the ID team recommended stopping the doxycycline.
There was concern that quinine may have been the cause of his hallucination so he was switched to atovaquone.
# Hearing loss: Pt began describing "muffled" hearing on HD 2.
It was thought that this may also have been secondary to quinine and hearing returned to [**Location 213**] once quinine was discontinued.
He was not started on heparin SQ given concern for bleeding with severe thrombocytopenia.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # HTN: Lisinopril was held during hospitalization because of initial presenting hypotension.
Pt should follow up with physical therapy as an outpatient for treatment of chronic vertigo.

Outpatient Physical Therapy Please evaluate and treat, pt with recent diagnosis of babesiosis.
You were admitted for high fevers, low platelets, and problems with your kidneys and liver.
Your kidney and liver function responded appropriately, though your liver enzymes are still mildly elevated.
Your medications were changed at that time and the hallucinations resolved and hearing returned to [**Location 213**].
Start azithromycin 250mg by mouth daily until [**1-5**] 2.
Start atovaquone 750mg twice a day until [**1-5**]  Continue all other medications as prescribed.
