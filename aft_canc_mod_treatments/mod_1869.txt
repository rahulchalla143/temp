Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for a craniotomy and resection of a brain mass in the left temporal region.
The surgery was complicated by a severe word finding difficulty, which markedly improved over several days.
High-dose methotrexate chemotherapy was given [**2166-3-5**] and you tolerated this well, but will need to take an additional day of sodium bicarbonate and leucovorin to help the kidneys continue excreting the chemotherapy.
This was treated with DDAVP and careful monitoring of sodium levels.
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) & Senna while taking narcotic pain medication.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and Ibuprofen etc.
