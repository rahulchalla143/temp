Overall, the patient tolerated the procedure well and was brought back to the floor with a thoracic epidural catheter for post-operative analgesia, foley catheter, and JP drain x2.
Following the procedure, UOP was 50cc/hr with Foley in place (Cr=0.6).
She was subsequently referred for angiography and percutaneous intervention.
The patient received Heparin IV 4000U and 1U pRBC, sodium bicarbonate 150mEq (200cc bolus and then 100cc/hr x6h), and mucomyst x4 doses.
Findings revealed: small pseudoaneurysm at the common hepatic artery origin just distal to the take off the GDA, luminal narrowing of the common and right hepatic artery origin consistent with stenosis, patent intrahepatic right hepatic artery distal to aforementioned area, no active extravasation of contrast, possible small focal dissection involving the proximal GDA, patent intrahepatic left hepatic artery, perfusion abnormalities consistent with infarction involving segments VII and V with the branch of right hepatic artery supplying these areas extending to the resection margin, marked gallbladder luminal distension and wall edema, and small bilateral effusions, right greater than left, with adjacent compression atelectasis.
Heparin 5000U SC bid was administered on POD#1 and changed to heparin gtt on POD#2, which was then temporarily held on POD#3 in order for the epidural to be removed and was then restarted following catheter removal.
Due to temperature of 101.7, she was started on zosyn, vanco, and flagyl on POD #3, and blood and urine cultures were taken.
At this time, she was tolerating a regular diet, and medications were switched to orals.
She was initially placed on vicodin due to percocet allergy, but then changed to po dilaudid due to complaints of nausea despite zofran and compazine.
The following morning, she received another dose of IV ativan (1mg) and again, became increasing somnolent, confused, and incontinent.
Ativan was subsequently held; her home dose (0.5mg po q4-6hr) was given later that evening on an as needed basis and IV ativan was avoided.
Due to these findings, she was taken back to the operating room and underwent an open cholecystectomy on [**2176-8-16**].
She tolerated the procedure well with no complications and was taken back to the floor post-operatively.
She received Toradol and Dilaudid IV for pain control, in addition to ativan po prn.
Heparin gtt was continued with goal INR 60-80.
She was switched to coumadin on POD #9/#1 and heparin gtt was continued until discharge on [**2176-8-21**].
On discharge, she was tolerating a regular diet, denied nausea, reported adequate pain control with tylenol and ativan prn, and was ambulating independently.
She was discharged on coumadin 5mg daily in adddition to her previous home medication regimen.
She was scheduled to have PT, PTT, and INR drawn on Thursday [**8-22**].
