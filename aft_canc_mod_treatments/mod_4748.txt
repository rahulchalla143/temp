She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and on [**2104-12-16**] underwent a redo sternotomy and redo mitral valve replacement with a 29-mm St. [**Hospital 923**] Medical Biocor tissue valve.
Her bypass time was 108 minutes with a crossclamp time of 66 minutes.
She tolerated the operation but required inotropic and pressor support post operatively, she was transferred from the operating room to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition on epinephrine, Milrinone and Levophed.
Vasopressin was added and Levophed was weaned to off on the operative day.
On the morning of POD1 sedation was weaned and she was extubated.
She was continued on milronone until post operative day 4 due to right ventricular dysfunction.
The patient was started on Natrecor and Lasix drips with increased diuresis.
The drips were discontinued on post operative day 4 and she continued to diurese with Lasix daily.
Her renal function continued to improve with creatinine returning to baseline prior to discharge.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per cardiac surgery protocol.
The patient continued to progress slowly with physical therapy and was found ready for transfer to rehab on POD 8.
