In the intensive care unit her prednisone was increased to 20 mg p.o.
and her diet was changed to a lactose-free, red meat-free diet.
She was ordered back to the regular floor on [**9-19**] where here abdominal pain she graded as 2 to 3 out of 10, however, it still required Dilaudid 2 to 3 mg IV q2 to 3 hours.
Dilaudid 1 to 2 mg every 2 to 3 hours.
She was given two tablets of Percocet and after 5 minutes she said the pain had gotten worse to 7 out of 10.
We talked to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21721**], who faxed an up to date listing of her psychiatric medications and advised that we do not let her sign out in a distraught state.
He informed us that she is under many psychosocial stressors with a strong psychiatric history, so therefore she was a suicide risk, even she denied any suicidal ideation at the time.
Regarding her chest pain an EKG was done and it showed no changes from previous exam, so it was decided that this chest pain was not of cardiac origin, but merely referred pain from her abdomen.
The psychiatric consult recommended that we re-start the patient's medications that she never informed us of, which include Klonopin 0.5 mg q.a.m.
and q.afternoon with 1 mg of Klonopin before bedtime, also Remeron 15 mg p.o.
That night the patient's pain was controlled with Percocet one to two tablets every 4 to 6 hours and breakthrough pain was controlled by 5 mg of Oxycodone every 4 to 6 hours, however, the Percocet was the first line medication.
