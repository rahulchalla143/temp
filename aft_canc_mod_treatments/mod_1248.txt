PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 6314**] is a 70 yo female with MMP, including CHF with EF 30-35%,including PEG tube for achalasia & esophagitis, osteoporosis c/b compression fractures, and pituitary adenoma s/p radiation (last treatment [**2161-5-26**]) who presented from rehab w/ lethargy and fatigue.
Per rehab records, patient was on fluid restriction x24 hours on [**6-4**], then given lasix 100mg IV BID which was decreased to daily and was continued on fluid restriction of 1 liter.
She received 1 liter NS and levofloxacin 500 mg IV x1.
Coronary artery disease with history of V. fib arrest, S/P LAD stent and repeat cath in [**10/2159**] The LAD had patent stnets with 50-60% proximal moderate instent restenosis.

Her SBP trended down from 90s-110s to 80s which was initially responsive to IVF and then unresponsive.
Given concern for potential early urosepsis patient was transferred to the MICU for further management on [**2161-6-12**].
She was continued on vanco, ceftaz, and flagyl (?
aspiration on CTA chest) as well as Bactrim for stenotrophomonas.
On [**6-14**], patient had an episode of increased RR, increased O2 requirement, hypertensive requiring NTG gtt, lasix, lopressor, and morphine.
Treated with asa/plavix, heparin given h/o GI bleeding and Hct drop.
Cardiology was consulted for NSTEMI and recommended medical management.
Neuro attributed to toxic metabolic derangements vs. watershed infarct but no further intervention entertained.
Today [**6-17**], received 20 mg IV lasix w/ brisk diuresis leading to tachycardia to 120s (baseline has been 90s-100s) which resolved back to baseline w/ 250 cc NS.
Also attempted to increase beta blocker but systolic BPs dropped to 90s which returned to the 100s with IVF.
Back pain has also [**Last Name 19301**] problem throughout admission on multiple pain medications and lidocaine patch.
Denies back pain, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, N/V, diarrhea.
Patient currently afebrile with fluctuating but currently improving Completed 7 day course of ceftaz/bactrim for UTI.
Hct stable following PRBC transfusion so less likely bleeding.
She was continued on antibiotics for her enterococcus bacteremia.
She was started on low dose captopril, 3.125 mg QID which was decreased to TID due to more frequent low BPs in the 80s.
# NSTEMI: cardiology consulted and recommended medical management.
Anterior LV aneurysm as well.
Tenuous volume status intermittently requiring lasix and IVF to manage hypotension in the ICU.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient's volume status remained stable and only intermittently required small NS boluses for poor po intake and low SBPs into 80s (although always asymptomatic).
Digoxin was started following drop in EF post NSTEMI.
Low dose ace inhibitor started as described above.
She was otherwise continued on her low dose beta blocker.
She should follow up with her outpatient cardiologist as scheduled and may benefit from evaluation by EP for potential AICD placement.
It was noted that she could benefit from anticoagulation given her LC aneurysm but given her history of GI bleed and guiaic positive stools in house, this intervention was not pursued.
It was thought that these could potentially be acute, but as above, GI bleeding precluded anticoagulation and she was already on antiplatelet therapy.
She was therefore continued on her aspirin and plavix without further intervention.
# UTI: discharged on ciprofloxacin for 2 days to complete a 7 day course.
No active bleeding currently on asa, plavix but did continue to be intermittently guiaic positive.
She was transfused 1 additional unit of PRBCs on the floor and following, Hct remained stable.
She was continued on PPI and iron supplements throughout.
She was continued on standing tylenol and lidocaine patch with oxycodone prn with reasonable control of her pain.
Back to baseline after the above interventions.
She was continued on her mirtazipine and Cymbalta.
# PPx- SC heparin, PPI, fall precautions, bowel regimen .
