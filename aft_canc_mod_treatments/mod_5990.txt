# acute renal failure: etiology of ARF was unclear but was likely multifactorial, with post-renal, as patient voided 1L after placement of foley in ED; prerenal, as dry on exam at admission, has increased volume loss with ostomy and had volume-responsive hypotension; and intrinsic, as creatinine was slightly elevated at 1.6 3 weeks pta.
Of note, the renal ultrasound the patient had was after decompression with Foley catheter and given possibility of post-XRT scarring may not have shown hydroureter.
Metformin held during admission and should not be restarted at rehab given impaired renal functinon.
Stooling significantly from both ileostomy and rectum.
Discussed with surgery, who confirmed that patient's GI tract is intact, with anastomosis; ileostomy was planned to temporarily decrease stool passing new anastomosis.
Restarted effexor and geodon after mental status cleared, but holding klonopin as patient became very sedated after receiving single dose of this.
After receiving amp of D50 and bicarb in D5W, glc up to 400s.
Briefly on insulin drip for euglycemic control, transitioned to sliding scale insulin.
Holding metformin given lactic acidosis in the setting of elevated creatinine; can re-evaluate and likely restart this after renal function has normalized.
When transferred to floor, maintained on 10units glargine qHS plus humalog sliding scale which was titrated for good blood sugar control.
Held metoprolol initially but restarted at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
Olmesartan (Benicar) can also be restarted once renal function stabilized.
# pancytopenia: WBC, Hct, and Plts all down on HD 2.
Supportive transfusion (1 unit given in MICU) to keep Hct >24.
# FEN: - hyperkalemia: QRS slightly widened and T waves peaked on presentation, after calcium/insulin + D50/bicarb, QRS has normalized and T wave peaking less marked.
