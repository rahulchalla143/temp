His pain was controlled with ativan, fentanyl gtt, and a morphine gtt.
The following issues were addressed during his brief hospitalization:  # Acute anemia:  Possible etiologies of blood loss included GI bleeding from the tumor at the esophageal stent or hemobilia with recent stent placement are both highly possible, especially in the setting of his coagulopathy and recent lovenox administration.
He was given a total of 4 units pRBCs during this hospitalization with Hct resolving to 26.
He was given vitamin K and FFP for elevated INR and DIC labs were checked.
He was started on an octreotide and protonix gtt's for GI bleeding prophylaxis.
With elevated WBC and biliary obstruction, cholangitis was considered a likely cause, despite the lack of RUQ pain and fevers.

Since he was not responsive to IVF boluses and 5% albumin, he was started on Levophed due to persistent hypotension.
