The patient denied fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or change in her fingerstick blood glucose.
Nonsmall cell lung cancer, status post chemotherapy and XRT.
Diverticulitis, status post sigmoid resection.
Rectal cancer, status post low anterior resection with ileostomy.
DVT, status post [**Location (un) 260**] filter placed in [**2109**] with recurrent extensive left lower extremity DVT seen on admitting ultrasound.
Percocet p.r.n.
GI:  Soft, nontender, well-healed surgical scars, and a ileostomy bag.
Chemistry panel revealed a sodium of 128, potassium 6.1, chloride 98, bicarbonate 22, BUN 57, creatinine 1.6, glucose 102.
She was placed on a heparin drip for the deep venous thromboses and conservative measures were utilized to improve the bilateral lower extremity edema.
Subsequently, the patient was known to have decreasing platelet counts and was switched from heparin to lepirudin on [**2128-12-18**].
On the following day, [**2128-12-19**], the patient was found hypotensive in respiratory distress and was intubated on the floor and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.
Her initial ICU course was notable for CT of the chest revealing right lower lobe consolidation, bronchoscopy with bronchial alveolar lavage yielding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus for which she was started on vancomycin and levofloxacin.
The patient required inotropes during her ICU stay which were finally weaned off on [**2128-12-22**].
On [**2128-12-29**], the patient again required noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for an additional attempt for persistent desaturations.
The patient did not tolerate this procedure and required endotracheal intubation.
The patient's ICU course was further complicated by acute renal insufficiency and GI bleeding requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells while anticoagulated for the previously identified deep venous thromboses.
