Na 139 K 4.3 Cl 108 BUN 23 Creat 0.5 Gluc 155 WBC 7.5 Hct 27.3 Platelets 389  Brief Hospital Course: 80 yoF with DM, HTN, dementia, diverticulosis/GIB who was admitted to SICU after found to have perforated diverticulosis/abdominal abscess/fistula which is now s/p drainage/I&D and 3 wk course of vanc/zosyn, whose post-op course complicated by re-intubation for CHF vs aspiration PNA, extubated after diuresis; also with tachy-brady (atrial tach, asymptomatic bradycardia) syndrome and malnutrition.
During this hospitalization, her goals of care were changed to be DNR/DNI and goals were shifted towards comfort care after discuassion with hospice and family.
She was kept on aspiration precautions, had S/S evaluation showing that she can tolerate soft solids and should have nutritional supplement with meals and 1:1 supervision during eating.
She was discharged with an ostomy bag draining the fistula.
Tachy/bradycardia: Pt noted to have runs of narrow complex SVT through SICU and started on Metoprolol; then noted to have bradycardia and beta blockade held.
EP was consulted and did not feel any intervention warranted.
After transfer to the CCU, a family meeting was held to discuss the possibility of pacemaker placement, however not consistent with goals of care which are to avoid further interventions and procedures.
Pt was discharged off of her bblocker given risk of bradycardia, and HRs in the low 100s were tolerated.
In discussion with surgery, she was a poor candidate for PEG placement her hx of pulling tubes.
HTN/Pump: She was continued on Metoprolol (as above, continued on it after pacer placement), Lasix, Valsartan, Simva, baby ASA.
Her bblocker was held due to her bradycardia, and simvastatin and asa were dc'd on discharge given newly defined goals of care.
DM: Continued on regular insulin sliding scale with good control.
Ostomy contents were guaic and were positive, so likely having chronic slow ooze from GI tract.
Therefore, pacemaker and peg tube placement were not done and medications were minimized on discharge.
Hospice has been notified at her rehab facility and the family will follow up with them on discharge.
