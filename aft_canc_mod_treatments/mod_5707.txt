Briefly Ms [**Name13 (STitle) 98372**] was diagnosed with metastatic Colon cancer in [**2148**] and treated with resection and 5FU / Leucovorin.
Her chemotherapy regimen has been held for the past several weeks due to the elevated bili and it was recommended that she have the percutaneous biliary procedure which was performed on [**6-6**].
Previously placed metal stent was seen in the major papilla with distal occlusion.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a balloon catheter using a free-hand technique.
The left hepatic system was dilated with the external biliary drain in place.
ROS: Feels sleepy after procedure but otherwise well.
Onc Hx: Metastatic colon cancer; stage C when diagnosed in [**8-/2148**] and treated with resection and 6 cycles of adjuvant 5-FU and leucovorin.
Has been treated with FOLFOX/Avastin since 1/[**2153**].
s/p chole s/p hernia repair   Social History: Patient lives at home with her husband.
Percutaneous drain in place with no evidence of erythema, bleeding or drainage at site.
Previously placed metal stent was seen in the major papilla with distal occlusion.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a balloon catheter using a free-hand technique.
The left hepatic system was dilated with the external biliary drain in place.
[**6-19**] Tube cholangeogram IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 8.5-French right biliary drainage tube, placed through the stent within the common bile duct into the duodenum for internal drainage.
Successful replacement of pre-existing left biliary drainage tube with a 6F nephrostomy catherter for external drainage.
Tip of right- sided Port- A-Cath type catheter overlies the SVC/RA junction.
The ampullary area was examined using a duodenoscope.
The ooze was flushed several times and seemed to be originating from the periampullary area secondary to trauma from IR stent insertion +/- metal stent change of position.
[**6-21**] GI Bleeding study: INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for 90 minuteswere obtained.
The patient is status post PTC and two catheters are seen within the liver entering via frontal and right lateral approaches.
A common bile duct stent is unchanged in appearance.
Bilateral cholangiograms performed demonstrate decompressed system and right-sided biliary catheter retracted into the liver parenchyma.
The left- sided biliary catheter presents in good position and drainage of the left- sided biliary ducts.
Successful exchange for right-sided biliary catheter for a 10 French biliary catheter, the pigtail was coiled in the duodenum.
She was started on Levofloxacin after this procedure.
- On [**6-19**], IR placed a drain to her R biliary system that was also internalized to her duodenum.
They also replaced her L- biliary drain (this could not be internalized).
Her hct was stable and she did not require any transfusions during her hospital course.
On approximately [**6-27**], Vancomycin was stopped and she was switched to unasyn, based on sensitivities (her biliary fluid grew out enterococcus and K.
On discharge, she was sent out on augmentin and cipro to be taken ongoing.
- On [**6-26**], IR performed another cholangiogram as her bilirubin was persistently elevated and her drains seemed only to be intermittently draining.
They stated that they could offer her a surgical procedure to attempt to provide better drainage but based on the fact that here bili began to trend down and her drains seemed to be working, she decided to defer surgery for now.
- She is at very high risk for infection given her 2 biliary drains.
# HTN: atenolol held during her gi-bleed and for approx 6 days after and re-started at a lower dose prior to d/c - d/c of quinipril as did not seem to need it .
# Metastatic colon cancer: tx per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] covering initially and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] took over her care prior to D/c) - her colon cancer does not appear to be very agressive but she likely cannot receive any further chemotherapy [**2-15**] hyperbilirubinemia - [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] will continue to follow her bilirubin/CBC as an outpatient.
