He was started on Lasix and Spironolactone to prevent reaccumulation and these doses were increased to Lasix 80 mg and Spironolactone 200 mg.  4.
He was treated with a 1.0 liter per day fluid restriction.
Other possibilities included Heparin induced thrombocytopenia however the patient's platelet count remained stable in the 80,000 range and had no clinical signs of bleeding.
It was determined that Heparin will be continued while HIT antibody is pending.

He does wish to continue Lovenox and Coumadin to treat his pulmonary embolus and hypercoagulable state.
He should have a Coumadin level check q OD while adjusting Coumadin and fax to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6902**].
