Admission Date:  [**2166-7-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-8-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2093-12-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**] Chief Complaint: hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronchial stent revision  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 90972**] is a 72 yo F with a history of stage IIIb squamous cell carcinoma (dx [**1-/2166**], s/p chemo/radiation in [**State **], recently c/b bronchial obstruction in right mainstem and bronchus intermedius requiring stenting).
She came to the hospital today for scheduled bronchial stent revision.
She was also given 40mg of solumedrol out of concern for adrenal insufficiency (was recently on a short course of prednisone several weeks ago, not currently on steroids).
She was mentating well and oriented X3  Past Medical History: -Depression -Stage IIIb squamous cell carcinoma s/p chemo/rads  -Diagnosis [**2166-1-30**]  -Chemotherapy and Radiation in [**State 108**], details not currently available  -[**2166-6-20**] underwent cryodebridement of the RMS tumor and balloon dilatation of the right main stem and right upper lobe bronchus.
She also had a thoracentesis with 800mL removed, cytology negative.
12x30 mm Silicone stent was placed in the RMS and [**Hospital1 **].
Approximately 2 months ago she moved back to [**Location (un) 86**] to be closer to her son [**Name (NI) **] who is undergoing a stem cell transplant at [**Hospital1 18**].

The PleurX catheter ends in the right posterior costophrenic sulcus within a small amount of fluid.
Brief Hospital Course: 72F with stage IIIb squamous cell carcinoma (diagnosed [**1-/2166**], s/p chemo/XRT) recently c/b bronchial obstruction in right mainstem and bronchus intermedius requiring stenting and multiple IP procedures, with R PleurX catheter in place, transferred to ICU for hypotension post-bronchoscopy, currently off pressors.
ACTIVE ISSUES  #) Hypotension: Patient with baseline blood pressures in the systolic 80s-low 100s per her report and OMR notes.
She was started on neosynephrine, which was eventually able to be weaned for goal SBPs 90-low 100s.
She was emperically covered with vancomycin and zosyn but all cultures were negative and she was narrowed to augmentin to cover for post-obstructive PNA, however re-started back on vanc/zosyn when she decompensated after a further bronch procedure.
After transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she did not require pressors and her hypotension resolved.
Patient was weaned off pheylephrine, midodrine, and fludrocortisone and her BP has been stable on the floor.
Completed a 2 week course of antibiotics including vancomycin/Zosyn x 8 days (in addition to Augmentin x5 days earlier).
She received Advair and albuterol nebs with good relief.
She has PleurX in place for palliative drainage of her right pleural effusion.
The patient was offered palliative thoracentesis for the left pleural effusion by interventional pulmonary and she has declined.
She has continued O2 requirement of [**3-7**] L NC and desats easily with minimal exertion.
Have discussed with interventional pulmonary and it is unlikely that further procedures would greatly change her course given her end-stage disease (see goals of care below)  We have initiated oral morphine for relief of dyspnea and she feels it does help her symptoms somewhat.
Not a candidate for further radiation therapy.
No further interventions possible by interventional pulmonary for her extensive disease, including right mainstem bronchial lesion.
Seen by oncology in-house who felt that benefit of further outpt chemo would likely be limited.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (hospitalist) spoke with her oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 58562**] at [**Hospital3 **] [**Company 2860**], who agreed that she is a poor candidate for further systemic therapy.
#) Depression: Continue home regimen sertraline.
Palliative care was consulted and they recommended oral morphine prn dyspnea, as above.
Her treatment is palliative only, focused on relieving symptoms and helping her regain mobility if possible.
Further hospitalizations would likely not reverse the course of her illness, as she is a poor candidate for further invasive procedures (such as interventional pulmonary).
#) Patient coping, family stressors: Pt was most recently living in [**State 108**], but traveled back to MA to support her son who is currently undergoing bone marrow transplant at [**Hospital1 18**].
She also received Reiki session for relaxation and seemed to benefit from this as well.
