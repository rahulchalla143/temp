He was given Unasyn, dialaudid, Demerol, and transferred here via med flight for definitive management given that his care has been here.
With respect to the percutaneous drain, a decision was made not to internalize the drain with a stent with the rationale that if the underlying etiology of compression truly was lymphoma, this would likely improve with chemotherapy and the drain could subsequently be removed.
Patient here had initial PTC drainage bag replaced, as it had been capped when he was discharged.
Abd/pelvic CT shows multiple ground glass opacities in lung bases increased from prior study, multiple pulmonary nodules, small new right pleural effusion, worsening of small left pleural effusion, intrahepatic bilary duct dilation improving, PTC drain tip coiled in duodenum, multiple enlarged lymph nodes as on prior study.
Overall evaluation showed LAD compression on duodenum - and then obstucting on drain - went to IR - replaced drain w/ 10F double pigtail catheter.
Afebrile now, off pressors since 1h in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] - on zosyn/cipro - growing pan-sensitve GNR here (need to get speciation) - FNA flow - showing lymphoma - BMT service did BM bx tonight prior to tx to BMT floor- had Chest/Neck CT to look for assessible exisional bx.

Percutaneous biliary drain in place with the tip coiled within the duodenum.
Diffuse clustered nodular opacities in the lung parenchyma, assuming a distribution that suggests non-recent infection, compared with areas of parenchymal fibrosis and traction bronchiectasis as well as paramediastinal fibrosis.
They do not express any other characteristic antigens including CD5, CD23, FMC-7.
Pathology [**10-26**]: DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal lymph nodes, incisional biopsy      Diffuse & Nodular large B cell lymphoma (See note) .
CSF FLOW CYTOMETRY [**11-9**] Diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by B-cell lymphoma are not seen in specimen.
Stable position of a right external internal transhepatic biliary drain (NU stent due to duodenal obstruction)with distal pigtail tip in the proximal jejunum.
Marked improvement of extensive periportal, paraduodenal, mesenteric, and paraaortic conglomerate adenopathy.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary reason for hospitalization: Mr. [**Known lastname 28445**] is a 75 year old man with history of panhypopituitarism and suspected pituitary lesion status post undiagnostic transphenoidal biopsy who presented with sepsis due to biliary obstruction from mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
Patient recieved a percutaneous biliary drain and underwent a laparoscopic lymph node biopsy, results show diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
He underwent therapy with R-CHOP.
Laparoscopic excisional LN biopsy definitively characterize as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
TTE for baseline cardiac assessment was grossly normal with EF>55% and no valvular abnormalities or focal hypokinesis.
e was kept in the hospital for to assess need for CNS treatment for lymphoma as well given his pituitary problems below, however, it was finally decided that the pituitary is not due to lymphoma.
TLS labs were checked twice a day and the patient was continued on acyclovir prophylaxis and provided with caphosol mouth care.
He should take filgrastim at home in between chemotherapy treatments.
Percutaneous biliary drain and biliary stent were placed during last hospitalization and capped prior to that discharge; perc drain was revised after patient presented again in sepsis.
Unfortunately, once he became neutropenic, he again developed sepsis and a cholangitis picture with right upper quadrant pain and elevated liver enzymes especially alkaline phosphatase.
The drain was uncapped and 650 cc of cloudy fluid was drained with immediate relief of pain, recovery of blood pressure, and resolution of fever.
He was treated with cefepime/flagyl and then stepped down to cipro/flagyl by mouth for 14 days upon discharge.
The biliary drain was exchanged for a different type by interventional radiology after the 2nd episode of sepsis.
Interventional radiology recommended that the drain remain in place for 3 months until the lymphadenopathy has shrunk enough for the biliary system to stay open without the drain.
Patient was diagnosed with central DI shown by DDAVP test where he had 3X concentration of urine osm after DDAVP prior to admission.
He was maintained for several days on desmopressin 0.05 mg once at night with normal serum sodium levels.
Was started on hydrocortisone by [**Hospital3 **] endocrinologist and levothyroxine.
Total T4 ok (on replacement), but very low TSH on replacement levothyroxine.
He was discharged on prednisone 10 mg daily to support his adrenal function and his levothyroxine was increased to 100 daily due to constipation and 4 low-normal.
Hypercalcemia resolved with IV hydration for hypernatremia.
# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY ([**Last Name (un) **]): Patient's Cr was initially elevated to 1.5, likely mixed ATN/pre-renal process as patient was septic.
He was aggressively volume repleted in ICU and Cr normalized(baseline 1.0).
He was restarted on his home lisinopril, amlodipine, and metoprolol one at a time.
# Pulmonary Nodules:  Patient had CT chest that showed diffuse and partly clustered micronodules with tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] distribution, as well as airway wall thickening and mild irregularities.
# Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): Continued on home omeprazole.
# Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH): continued on home finasteride 5mg daily.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Please ensure that he continues to stay on schedule with R-CHOP cycles (cycle 1 completed during this admission) for his DLBCL.
He has been stable on desmopressin 0.05 mg PO at night - Please check hematocrit, calcium, and creatinine at follow-up to ensure that these are remaining normal - He should have a repeat MRI in [**4-13**] weeks and follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] (neuro-oncologist) to make sure no tumor appears.

You were treated with antibiotics for the infection and a drain was placed in your gallbladder to open up the blockage.
You were treated with more antibiotics and the drain was changed for a different type.
The drain will need to stay in place for the next 3 months because that is how long it will take for the lymphoma to shrink so that your intestines can open up again.
Also, you recieved some chemotherapy for your lymphoma, called R-CHOP.
You will follow your lymphoma with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
You will also use injections called filgrastim at home in between chemotherapy to build up your body for the next round of chemotherapy.
You should continue taking the steroids and thyroid hormone replacement for the low pituitary.
The following changes were made to your medications: START TAKING THE FOLLOWING MEDICATIONS:    - filgrastim 300 mcg every day for 10 days in between chemotherapy    - prednisone 10 mg daily    - desmopressin  0.05 mg at night, your dose might be adjusted by      Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4160**], his office will call you everyday    - lidocaine gel apply topically to drain every 24 hours under       dressing    - oxycodone 5 mg every 6 hours as needed for pain    - acyclovir 400 mg every 8 hours to prevent viral infections    - ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily until [**11-25**]    - metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours until [**11-25**].
