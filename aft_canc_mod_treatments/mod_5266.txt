Your INR was high on admission, which can predispose to bleeding, and your coumadin was held.
You were restarted on heparin after the EGD, which will be continued until your coumadin level is therapeutic.
You were given a medication called metoprolol to control your heart rate from going too fast.
This medication will be continued when you leave the hospital.
