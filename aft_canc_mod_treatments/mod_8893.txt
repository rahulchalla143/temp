Brief Hospital Course: 47F with PMH of chronic depression, hypothyroidism, and alcohol abuse presenting with hematochezia and abdominal distension and signs of acute liver injury with secondary portal hypertension/ascites.
1) Portal hypertension complicated by ascites due to acute or chronic hepatitis:  Pt presented with thromobocytopenia, increased transaminases with AST>ALT, elevated bilirubin, and elevated INR that did not normalize with vitamin K.  She also had ascites that was eventually revealed to have a SAAG of 1.3 suggestive of being due to portal hypertension.
She remained with an elevated bili, INR, and low platelets suggesting chronic cirrhosis but given she was otherwise stable she was discharged to follow up in liver clinic for further management and work up.
Colonoscopy did not show any colitis and C diff negative so metronidazole stopped.
SBP was also entertained as a source of fever but by time of paracentesis (deferred due to bedside procedure being technically infeasible and the deferred for endoscopies) she had received four days of antibiotics.
Therefore she completed five days of ciprofloxacin for possible SBP.
Patient has hx of anemia from folate deficiency.
She felt considerably better after transfusion and with higher Hct.
5) Hypothyroidism: Pt acknowledged taking levothyroxine irregularly at best.
