Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted for elective right colectomy for colonic polyp that could not be removed  on colonoscopy.
He tolerated the procedure well and was extubated and transferred to the PACU in good condition.
On POD 0 he was transferred to the floor, was kept NPO with IVF running.
He had an epidural placed for the operation and needed it replaced in the PACU.
Neuro: Epidural was placed initially for pain management and was removed on POD 3 and patient was transitioned to IV then PO pain medications.
He was started on a CIWA scale but was not noted to score until overnight POD3 into POD4.
He was put on standing Ativan Q4 on POD4 and POD5, required 2 point restraints and was transferred to the unit on POD6 for concern that patient would not be able to protect airway with increased work of breathing.
In the ICU he did not require intubation and was weaned off ativan with haldol used for agitation.
He was given an appointment for [**Hospital1 **] Substance Abuse Group on Monday to discuss outpatient treatment for his ETOH dependence.
He was on telemetry and this was thought to be sinus tachycardia.
He was given IV lopressor then PO diltiazem to control this heart rate but his heart rate was noted to rise up to 130 on POD 5.
He had his diltiazem stopped and focus was placed on his withdrawal.
He had an echo done on POD 5 that showed an EF of 60-65% with hyperdynamic LV function.
Resp: He has underlying COPD and was noted to be wheezy requiring frequent nebulizer treatments with both ipratropium and albuterol.
On POD 3 he was noted to become [**Month (only) **] rile to 102 and was started on cipro for presumed HAP in setting of a CXR that showed question of PNA.
At this point he was switched to vancomycin and later broadened with zosyn.
He was given a neb treatment and RR reduced to 20s.
He was started on low dose budesonide and was slowly weaned from face mask 50% oxygen down to room air, requiring minimal nebulizer treatments.
He had good O2 sats on room air after 2 days of budesonide treatment.
He had no respiratory distress after his time in the ICU and was discharged on budesonide until he sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his pulmonologist, on discharge.
Soon after it became clear that he was withdrawing from alcohol and he was kept NPO until POD 8.
He was given TPN on POD 7,8,9 and was restarted on clears after his NGT was removed and advanced to regular diet on POD 10.
The next day patient had IR drain placed next to anastomosis, enterocutaneous fistula was confirmed, and a VAC was placed on the opened vertical abdominal incision.
He had one episode of emesis on POD 15 and was moved back to clears with Enlive supplements and given some MIVF.
After this he was scanned again and found to have a more organized additional collection in the pelvis for which he underwent drain placement that same day.
He was bolused and given albumin on POD2 with good urine response.
In the setting of wheezing and a chest x-ray that appeared wet he was then given Lasix on POD 3 with good response.
A foley was placed and his urine output returned to [**Location 213**] with gentle hydration.
ID: He was started on ciprofloxacin initially for presumed HAP on POD 3.
He was then transitioned to vancomycin on POD4 and was broadened to zosyn on POD5.
On POD 13 the peri-anastomotic collection was cultured and showed [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Albicans, sensitive to fluconazole and patient was continued on vanc/zosyn until he had acute drop in renal function with subsequent decrease in his WBC.
Vanc and zosyn were stopped as stated above and patient remained afebrile off antibiotics.
He continued on fluconazole throughout this episode until the day of discharge.
He was also restarted on cipro/flagyl for persistent leukocytosis after his ATN began to resolve.
All antibiotics and fluconazole were discontinued on discharge and patient had lowest WBC of 13 at this time.
He was started on aspirin but had this stopped during the ATN episode.
He was then restarted on aspirin 325mg daily at discharge.
He had a PICC line placed as well for TPN and this was taken out before he went home.
