Blood Gas [**2126-6-19**] 08:07    ART             108* 52* 7.36 31* 2 NOT INTUBA1 [**2126-6-18**] 17:17    ART             97 47* 7.38 29 1 NOT INTUBA1 O2   Brief Hospital Course: This is an 80 year old female with PMH of metastatic small cell lung cancer who presented for evaluation of left sided weakness and confusion and was found to have a right frontal lobe brain mass for which a craniotomy and resection was performed by neurosurgery on [**2126-6-14**].
Her post-operative course was complicated by respiratory failure requiring transfer to the MICU from the neurosurgical service for initiation of biPAP, steroids, and an empiric course of antibiotics which resolved her respiratory distress.
She should be continued on a maximal bowel regimen for her comfort.
She was started on Keppra and Decadron and taken to the OR by neurosurgery for a craniotomy and right frontal lobe mass resection without complication.
Post-operatively she was alert and oriented x3 with left facial droop/pronator drift and 4/5 weakness of the left upper extremity.
She became unresponsive for several days in the ICU, but her mental status improved spontaneously with treatment of her respiratory failure detailed below.
She was continued on steroid taper per recommendations of neurosrugery and discharged on dexamethasone 2mg PO BID to continue indefinitely.
She was also continued on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
Her craniotomy sutures are dissolvable and will not need to be removed, but a follow-up appointment has been made with neurosurgery for her convenience if she would like to follow-up for any questions.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  The patient began desatting to the mid 80's overnight on [**6-18**] which was rectified temporarily with 3L NC, deep nasal suctioning, and albuterol nebulizers.
Significantly improved after course of steroids and empiric antibiotics for HAP.
She has been weaned from biPAP to 2L nasal cannula.
Less likely PE or CHF as the patient has improved dramatically with abx and steroids alone.
Ciprofloxacin was also initally given for a 3 day course.
Albuterol/ipratropium nebs were administered on a PRN basis.
Solumedrol 125 mg IV q8H was initiated on [**6-19**] for presumed COPD flare as well as anti-inflammatory effect following extensive neurosurgical procedure, which was tapered to dexamethsone 2mg PO BID indefinitely per neurosurgical recommendations.
An EEG was performed on [**6-18**] and showed evidence of a moderate encephalopathy perhaps stemming from metabolic derangements, medications, infection, anoxia, or hypercarbia.
She is s/p multiple chemo/XRT regimens and heme/onc was involved in her initial care this admission.
No anticoagulation was given due to multiple brain mets and recent post-op status.
HTN: Continued home regimen of terazosin and lisinopril with goal SBP<160.
# DM: The patient had increased hyperglycemia secondary to steroid dosing which responded to increased glargine up to 20 units and Humalog insulin sliding scale.
Her home oral hypoglycemics of Avandia and metformin were continued at discharge.
Her home glipizide was discontinued given her poor PO intake.
