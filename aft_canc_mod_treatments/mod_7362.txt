Today, the nephew picked up the patient for a routine visit with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3759**], his Oncologist where it was noted that the patient was having increased dyspnea on exertion and new bilateral ankle swelling.

He was transferred to the CCU for closer monitoring and remained hemodynamically stable with a pulsus paradoxus <10 mmHg.
Therapeutic/diagnostic thoracentesis performed on [**2120-1-25**] with 1450 cc out.
HR improved with IV metoprolol and he was given PO metoprolol for rate control.
Pt was sent home on metoprolol with cardiology follow up in 1 week.
The primary oncology team felt that although his CHADS score was 3 he was not a candidate for anticoagulation with warfarin given recent history of intracerebral hemorrhage and would not be a good candidate for aspirin given his low platelets in the setting of chemotherapy with likely continued chemotherapy in the near future.
Out of concern for progression of disease (most likely pericardial/pleural effusions reflecting this, and evidence of lymphoma cells on pleural fluid analysis), rituxan was started [**2120-1-28**].
He was given solumedrol and he tolerated the rest of the effusion without problems.
[**Name (NI) **] was to continue with bendamustine, but pt became hypotensive and was transferred to the CCU out of concern for progressive pericardial effusion.
Will continue with bendamustine as an outpatient.
PLTs initially trended down with administration of rituxan, with a nadir at 15 on the 3rd day after rituxan administration.
3 way foley was inserted and pt was continuously irrigated for >24 hours, eventually no clots were passing and foley was DCd.
This was managed with trazodone and prn haldol.
Home lisinopril was changed to captopril as captopril has shorter half-life and in the setting of tamponade physiology there was concern of inducing futher hypotension.

Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent, but should be using a walker whenever possible to steady gait.
We drained the fluid from your lungs but felt it was too dangerous to drain the fluid around your heart.
Regarding your lymphoma, we treated you with rituximab while you were in the hospital.
You had a fever and chills as a reaction, but we were eventually able to finish the whole dose of medication without problems.
Your platelets dropped very low which is to be expected with chemotherapy.
While you were here, we put in a foley catheter to drain your bladder because you were not making very much urine.
The foley catheter was accidentally pulled out while you were moving around in the morning and caused a significant amount of bleeding.
We used another catheter to irrigate the bladder and this healed without problems.
We made the following CHANGES to your medications: STARTED metoprolol CHANGED your lisinopril to captopril (DO NOT TAKE LISINOPRIL ANYMORE.
STARTED albuterol nebulizer IF NEEDED for trouble breathing or wheezing STARTED senna for constipation  Followup Instructions: Department: HEMATOLOGY/BMT When: WEDNESDAY [**2120-2-7**] at 1:30 PM With: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 3750**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3885**], NP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3886**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) **] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  Department: CARDIAC SERVICES When: FRIDAY [**2120-2-9**] at 1:40 PM With: [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**] Building: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) **] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage  Department: [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 2352**] When: FRIDAY [**2120-2-16**] at 8:10 AM With: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1575**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1576**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1144**] Building: [**Location (un) 2355**] ([**Location (un) **], MA) [**Location (un) 551**] Campus: OFF CAMPUS     Best Parking: Free Parking on Site                                [**Name6 (MD) 11021**] [**Name8 (MD) 11022**] MD [**MD Number(2) 38620**]
