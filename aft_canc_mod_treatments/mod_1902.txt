He was initially placed on vancomycin (history of MRSA PNA), levaquin, and flagyl and the flagyl was d/cd.
On discharge day, we changed his antibiotics to doxycycline and flagyl and d/cd the levaquin as QTc ~510 and this would provide adequate coverage for aspiration and communication acquired pneumonia.
-The patient was ventilated on AC which was changed to pressure support.
He had a hematoma drained by thoracic surgery on [**2190-5-20**].
He will continue vancomycin for a 14 day course.
Gets [**Hospital1 **] wound packing to it and has follow up with thoracic surgery in 1.5 weks.
Was on lovenox and coumadin when came in and lovenox d/cd as INR was  >2 (goal [**2-20**]).
Will need to adjust coumadin accordingly and monitor INR closely.
Diabetes Mellitus- Maintained on insulin sliding scale while pt was here.
Mental status/agitation- initially unresponsive when he came here though quickly improved.
He was on haldol IV bid.
We continued mirtazapine qhs.
Atrial flutter- continued pt's metoprolol, aspirin and amiodarone.
The plan is to keep patient on amiodarone for possible cardioversion in the future.
CHF- initially held lasix but then continued it per outpatient dose.
F/E/N- tube feeds.
