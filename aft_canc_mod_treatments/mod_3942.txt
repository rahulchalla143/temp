Apparently, he refused central line (sepsis protocol).
Received IVF through peripheral IV, and repeat lactate was 2.4.
CT of the abdomen and he was admitted to OMED for further observation.
Treated with Avastin (bevacizumab), 5FU, and Leucovorin.
URINE  COLOR-Yellow APPEAR-Clear SP [**Last Name (un) 155**]-1.021 URINE  BLOOD-NEG NITRITE-NEG PROTEIN-TR GLUCOSE-NEG KETONE-TR BILIRUBIN-NEG UROBILNGN-NEG PH-6.5 LEUK-NEG RBC-0 WBC-0-2 BACTERIA-RARE YEAST-NONE EPI-0-2  Brief Hospital Course: 61 y/o male with metastatic rectal ca diagnosed [**3-26**] s/p xrt (last [**6-25**]) and chemo (last [**2120-9-25**]) who was admitted with diarrhea, fever, and neutropenia who developed hypoxemia, lactic acidosis, and confusion.
Since his admission, the patient's diarrhea and fevers had progressively improved on cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole as well as Lomotil.
In this setting, he denied pain (including abdominal) as well as dyspnea despite obvious tachypnea and mild accessory muscle use.
He was started on IVF with 3 amps bicarb, lactate trended down, acidosis resolving.
CT abdomen showed SBO with no obvious cut off for obstruction a NGT placed and medical management recommeneded by surgery.
He was treated with TPN given his poor nutritional status.
He was treated with octroetide per surgery recs with no improvement.
At that meeting it was decided to continue with fluids and analgesia but to limit other medications and TPN.
The patient was covered with cefepime, vancomycin, and flagyl given neutropenic fever.
The patient was given supportive care with IVF and Lomotil once obtained stool samples for cultures which were negative and his diarrhea improved with lomotil.
NGT was placed and surgey was consulted but did not feel that the patient was a good surgical candidate.
Patient was continued on medical management.
Octreotide was added to his regimen to help to relieve obstruction.
After several bloody stools and rectal tube placement his bloody bowel movements slowed, his coags improved and his hematocrit was stable.
He devloped GI bleed as mentioned above and was transfused several units of FFP and pRBCs and 1 unit of platelets.
The patient and family did not want any further transfusions as their goal was comfort and this would require daily monitoring of his CBC and coags.
# NEUTROPENIC FEVER: The patient was started on cefepime, vanco, and flagyl on admission.
He because hypoxic and acidotic and a CT chest was otained which revealed likely aspiration/pneumonia.
He was continue on his antibiotics to complete a 14 day course and received daily neupogen injections.
By the 11th day of his antibiotic course he was no longer neutropenic.
His neupogen was discontinued and he remained afebrile.
Patient refused central line/sepsis protocol in ED.
He then became more hypoxic and acidotc and was tranferred to the ICU.
It was felt that the lactic acidosis ,may have been secondary to the extreme distension of his stomach given the rapid decline in his lactate on decompression with NGT.
# RECTAL CANCER: Last chemotherapy was last avastin/5FU on [**9-25**].
Given that he did not tolerate this well, no further chemotherapy was planned.
He was continued on IVF and the NGGT was kept in place to prevent worsening pain from his SBO.
He was continued on IVF given his SBO.
Given his poor prognosis and that comfort was the goal, he was not started on TPN, but rather hydrated with IVF in the setting of SBO.
