Admission Date: [**2187-8-22**]        Discharge Date: [**2187-8-26**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  M  Service:  ENT   CHIEF COMPLAINT/HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 46185**] is a 78-year-old man with a history of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma status post x-ray therapy initially in [**2184**] with a subsequent left-sided partial laryngectomy due to local recurrence, ultimately receiving a total laryngectomy in [**2186-2-20**].
Tracheostomy site clean, dry and intact with tracheostomy collar, a large anterior mass inferior to the left tracheal wound.
He was started on Verapamil, racemic epinephrine p.r.n., a full liquid diet, plus all of his home medications, and placed on Ancef empirically.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was seen by Thoracic Surgery on the day of admission, who recommended Oncology consultation, steroids and continuous O2 saturation monitoring.
He received Decadron 10 mg IV q.8h.
Thoracic Surgery recommended consulting Interventional Pulmonology for stenting and rigid bronchoscopy.
He was seen on [**8-23**] and was made NPO for possible stent placement.
He had a tachy arrhythmia that was not atrial fibrillation and was continued on Verapamil and cleared for surgery.
An 18 x 40 mm covered stent was placed in the trachea and balloon-dilated to 20 mm.
He was seen by Radiation Oncology on [**8-23**] and was planned for palliative x-ray therapy to the upper mediastinal mass to relieve airway compression, after review of prior radiation history.
The location of the mass outside the original localized laryngeal radiation in [**2184**], may make him a candidate for additional radiation therapy to this mediastinal mass.
Depending on his condition following hospitalization and radiation therapy, he may be a candidate for concurrent chemotherapy, typically cisplatin, depending on medical status.
A milder, gentle sensitizing chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin and Taxol may be indicated depending on his physical status following hospitalization.
His Foley catheter was removed.
Thoracic Surgery signed off.
A [**7-/2138**]-mm Bloom- Singer laryngectomy tube was passed by the Otolaryngology Chief Resident after a discussion with the Pulmonary fellow, about where exactly his stent was.
The tube was trimmed so that it did not overlap the stent and the stoma was widely patent with the new tube.
He was on a low-sodium, low-fat diet, with activity as tolerated.
Furosemide 80 mg p.o.
Roxicet 5/325 mg per 5 ml, [**4-9**] ml p.o.
