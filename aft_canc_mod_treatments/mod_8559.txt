CT abd/pelvis without contrast [**2130-3-31**]: Evaluation of visceral organs is limited due to lack of intravenous contrast.
The left axillary, basilic and one of the left brachial veins are normal with appropriate compressibility and wall-to-wall flow on color analysis.
She had recent laparotomy for perforation of duodenal ulcer at OSH on [**2130-3-10**] so initially there was concern for possible intraabdominal bleed.
Both ASA and coumadin were held.
She received 4 units of blood and 3 units of FFP.
She received one dose of coumadin 2.5 mg on [**4-2**] while in the ICU for history of DVT.
They felt that the increase was due to coumadin, given recent antibiotics use and poor nutritional status.
Of note, several days prior to admission she was initiated on cipro for pyuria, although this proved not to be a bacterial infection.
Losartan was discontinued and received several doses of kayexalate.
Her home lasix was held at nursing facility but we increased the dose as she had severe edema up to the chest wall and hypoalbuminemia (anasarca; bilateral pleural efusions and ascites).
Because of her low GFR, lower doses of Lasix are usually ineffective.
We stopped the Losartan, Clonidine and Hydralazine and increased the Metoprolol and she remained normotensive.
If she becomes hypertensive hydralazine 50 mg Tablet every 8 hours can be restarted.
She was DNR/DNI but family needs to consider comfort measures only.
Potassium should be monitored with her low potassium diet.
