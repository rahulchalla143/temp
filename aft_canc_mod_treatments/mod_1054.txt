She subsequently completed a Decadron prior to considering chemotherapy.
The procedure was complicated by a small persistent right apical pneumothorax.
On the day of admission, the patient was watching television at home.
She later received an additional 3.0 mg of IV Ativan.
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, her blood pressure responded to intravenous fluid resuscitation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Metastatic cancer, brain and liver, presumably from the right lung mass.
Dilantin 17.7 (normal value of Dilantin is [**11-3**]).
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the OMED service for further management of her adenocarcinoma.
She was started on Decadron and Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis and reduction of cerebral edema associated with her metastatic disease.
It was thought that her initial decline in mental status was due to the combination of the high dose of intravenous Ativan she received immediately following her seizure and the effects of cerebral edema.
She did not require any intravenous fluid or medications.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Decadron 6.0 mg qid, Protonix 40 mg q day, Dilantin 300 mg q HS.
