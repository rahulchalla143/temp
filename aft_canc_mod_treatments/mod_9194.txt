Name:  [**Known lastname **],[**Known firstname 1340**]                  Unit No:   [**Numeric Identifier 10590**]  Admission Date:  [**2100-12-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-1-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2029-8-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1472**] Addendum: HPI: 71 y/o man with prior history of CLL s/p 1 month of cytoxin and five cycles of fludaribine (year [**2096**]) on chronic oral steroids for CLL and COPD developed progressive SOB beginning 2 months prior to admission.
He was started on levoquin and his prednisone was increased to 40mg [**Hospital1 **] from 20mg [**Hospital1 **].
Prior to his discharge he developed a fever, but left for home AMA as opposed to a rehab hospital.
He was started on empiric therapy: VAncomycin for MRSA cavitary pneumonia, acyclovir ?
HSV pneumonia, and bactrim for PCP coverage given his immunosuppression from CLL and chronic steroids.
HE was started on lovenox then transferred to [**Hospital1 8**] for management and diagnosis of the cavitary lesions/dyspnea.
He is followed by a pulmonologist who has treated him with Tio, albuterol nebs/MDI, salmeterol, fluticasone, and chronic steroids.
He has been unable to be weaned from steroids secondary to exacerbations of his COPD.
He has never been intubated for exacerbations.
He was seen by Oncology, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who started him on chemotherapy and radiation.
He completed 5 cylces of fludaribine which was stopped secondary to granulocytopenia.
He then underwent 1 month of cytoxin which was discontinued secondary to hemolytic anemia.
Since that time he has been on chronic steroids for dual management of his CLL and COPD.
He has a known reaction to IVIG (known after discussion with his nurse following his reaction to IVIG in the MICU hereat [**Hospital1 8**]) and gets premedicated with benadryl and decadron.
Hospital Course: He was admitted to the medicine service and started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation of his PE.
All antibiotics except for bactrim (PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2515**]) were discontinued given the lack of support for any particular organism and his stable respiratory function.
Given it's pleural base we consulted Interventional Radiology.
He initially improved off antibiotics, on anticoagulation only.
He was started on voriconazole and cipro for treatment of invasive aspergillus and nosocomial pseudomonas pneumonia.
