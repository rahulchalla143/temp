In [**Month (only) 956**] of this year, the patient was diagnosed with a right lateral seventh rib fracture following incidental trauma (leaning over the arm of a chair).
He was therefore restarted on pulmicort.
Coags and fibrinogen were WNL, so he initiated IVF's, but then triggered on [**4-15**] for increasing O2 requirement, somnolence and AMS and he was transferred to the ICU for further management.
He was continued on aggressive IVF's, Lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **], Allopurinol, Pamidronate (last dose on [**4-15**]), Calcitonin, & Dexamethasone 40mg IV (first dose on [**4-16**]).
Over the course of his ICU stay, his serum Ca trended down to 13.7, but his serum phosphate & uric acid continued to climb.
His O2 requirement also continued to rise and a CXR on [**4-17**] suggested a right middle lobe pneumonia so he was started on Ceftriaxone & Azithromycin for CAP.
Oncology recommended initiation of chemotherapy and he was therefore transferred to BMT.
On arrival to the floor, the patient immediately triggered for an O2Sat of 88-89% on 6L NC, so he was switched to a NRB sat'ing 97%.

He was vigourously hydrated with intravenous fluids and given lasix to maintain a urine output of over 200cc/hr.
He was given pamidronate, steroids, and calcitonin in the ICU.
His calcium level dropped with this regimen and at time of discharge from the ICU was low-normal.
# Multiple Myeloma/ Plasma cell leukemia: Patient with M-protein in both urine & serum identified as IgG kappa as well as end-organ damage manifested as ARF and anemia, diffuse lytic lesions on CT and hypercalcemia suggested a diagnosis multiple myeloma.
He was started on Dexamethasone therapy in the ICU on [**4-16**].
Patient had a normal serum viscosity and was without signs or symptoms of hyperviscosity syndrome, but a beta-2 microglobulin was 6.8.
Patient was treated with Dexamethasone 40 mg IV qd x 4d and then started on Velcade.
Subsequently, his therapy was switched to a modified hyper-CVAD regimen with Cytoxan/Doxorubicin and Dexamethasone.
The patient tolerated cycle 1 of this therapy well and responded appropriately with complete clearing of plasma cells from peripheral blood.
Tumor lysis labs were monitored [**Hospital1 **] during treatment, and whiel LDH and Uric acid where transiently elevated, the patient never required Rasburicase treatment.
Neupogen was initiated 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy at a lower dose of 300 mcg due to profound splenomegaly in this patient.
Oxycontin with Oxycodone PRN for breakthrough pain was initiated prior to discharge.
The patient was started on Acyclover, Atovaquone for prophylaxis.
At the time of discharge, neutropenia has resolved and neupogen was discontinued.
The patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for subsequent treatment of his PCL.
MRI of thorasic and lumbar spine as well as left hip was performed and revealed significant disk disease and hyperdensity at femoral neck region which could represent an area more suscpetible to pathological fracture.
In order to evealuate further for pathologic fracture, ORTHO CT of the pevis without contrast was performed and did not reveal any pathologic fractures, however revealed areas of possible cortical interruption in right iliac region and femoral neck, which may be susceptible to pathologic fracture.
# Dyspnea/Respiratory Distress: Early in the course of his hospitalization, the patient developed an increasing O2 requirement in the setting of known asthma, aggressive fluid therapy, and a new right middle lobe pneumonia with pulmonary edema on CXR and CT chest.
For the pneumonia he was initially treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin, but upon worsening of his respiratory status was empirically switched to cefepime and levofloxacin, ultimately completing a total of 14 days of antibiotics.
In the setting of an elevated BNP, aggressive fluid hydration, and signs of overload on CXR, he underwent a repeated echocardiograms that demonstrated acute worsening of the patient's pulmonary artery hypertension with a peak pressure of 60mm Hg.
He received aggressive diuresis with Lasix balanced with his need for IVF's during chemotherapy and his respiratory status improved on this regimen.
He was also continued on supplemental O2 with NC/face tent until his oxygen was weaned entirely and he was able to maintain his oxygen saturation on room air.
He was started on allopurinol.
He received Rasburicase on [**2136-4-18**].
His uric acid levels downtrended following administration of rasburicase and aggressive hydration to WNL, at which time allopurinol was d/ced.
His uric acid level normalized, but Allopurinol was restarted during his Cytoxan/Doxorubicin therapy.
As there was no evidence of TLS and LDH / Uric Acid trended down, Allopurinol was discontinued prior to discharge.
He was given rasburicase and aggressive hydration.
His urine output remained excellent throughout hospitalization and his Cr following hydration began to downtrend.
The patient's hematocrit and platelet counts were monitored and he was transfused as needed throughout admission.
The patient had multiple episode of epistaxis during his ICU stay with negligible blood loss that was corrected with Afrin, platelet transfusion, and switching his nasal cannula to humidified O2 via face tent.

You were treated for these problems initially in the intensive care unit and they have resolved.
[**Name (NI) **] received chemotherapy treatment initially with Velcade and Dexamethasone follwed by Cytoxan, Doxorubicin and Dexamethasone.
You were given a water pill called Lasix to remove extra fluid from your body.
We made the following changes to your medications:  We STARTED you on Furosemide 20mg daily We STRATED you on Atovaquone 750mg twice a day We STARTED you on Acyclovir 400mg every 8 hours We STARTED you on OxycoNTIN 10mg twice a day We STARTED you on OxyCODONE 5mg every 4 hours AS NEEDED for pain not adequately treated with Oxycontin  Please continue to take your other medications as prescribed.
Do not drive or operate heavy machinery while taking Oxycontin or Oxycodone as they can cause drowsiness.
Please continue to use CPAP machine at night.
You will also need to return for a Pamidronate infusion on Tuesday, [**2136-5-15**] and can inquire about the time when you call for your appointment.
