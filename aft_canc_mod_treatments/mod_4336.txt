Large area of parenchymal distortion in the lingular lung might represent scarring, although underlying mass can not be excluded and is of concern.
Then after IV administration of contrast, transaxial images from the thoracic inlet through the pelvis were obtained.
Gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and right adrenal gland are unremarkable in appearance.
CT [**2129-4-2**] IMPRESSION:  Expected postsurgical appearance status post resection of the left frontal lobe mass.
COMMENT: While certain feature, such as the central necrosis and "satellite nodule" are associated with primary glial neoplasms, the hypercellularity and restricted diffusion are quite atypical, with the overall constellation suggestive of either hypercellular metastasis, as seen with small cell bronchogenic carcinoma or, less likely, primary CNS lymphoma.
Multiple additional nodules throughout the brain suggest that these likely represent metastatic lesions and should be correlated with pathologic findings.
