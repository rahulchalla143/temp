He did complain of nasal congestion.
Past Medical History: CAD hypercholesterolemia HTN OSA CABG x 4 [**2-/2093**] AVR [**2-/2093**] with carbomedics and ascending aortic replacement with Vascutech graft T+A [**9-19**] Deviated septum - followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for potential surgery  Social History: Used to drink "quite a bit" but quit 30 years ago.
Coordination: Normal on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements, heel to shin on left.
A focused MRI of the posterior fossa with gadolinium-enhanced images would help for further assessment.
Exam was notable initially for upgaze and lateral nystagmus, dyarthria, right ataxic hemiparesis, left hemibody numbness and bifacial numbness.
Around the same time, he became hypoxic and required intubation for airway protection.
After intubation, he was suctioned for copious thick secretions and was presumed to have an aspiration pneumonia for which he was treated empirically with levofloxacin.
The coverage was broadened to include vancomycin and flagyl when he developed a high fever (103.8) the day after intubation.
Several days later, extubation was attempted with similar events; this second time he was unable to be converted from SVT and required cardioversion with success.
Given these events, it was determined that he could not be extubated and required tracheostomy and PEG tube.
During tracheostomy placement, he had a BAL off antibiotics; cultures from the BAL were negative so antibiotics were not restarted.
CVS: Had several episodes SVT requiring cardioversion with chemical or electrical.
Is anticoagulated for mechanical valve with therapeutic dose coumadin usually falling around 2.5 mg.  Has received most recently 7.5, 7.5 and 5, the last three evenings as he was off anticoagulation for pleural tap prior.
