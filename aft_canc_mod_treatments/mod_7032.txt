[**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]  DIAGNOSIS: Right pleural effusion:    NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Interval resolution of right-sided pleural effusion with placement of new right chest tube.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2178-3-30**] 4:41 AM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-24**] and 16: Right apical pleural tube still in place.
He was found to have recurrent pleural effusion, underwent repeat thoracentesis, R talc pleurodesis with chest tube/pleurex catheter placement.
Also concern for worsening of PE, but patient has been on Lovenox regularly at 1mg/kg [**Hospital1 **] dosing and also has IVC filter in place.
Lovenox was held for his IP procedures and restarted after the procedures.
Repeat CXR at that time showed re accumulation of pleural fluid, possibly due to clogged chest tube/pleurex, as his output had been decreasing.
However, in the ICU, his chest tube output increased again with improvement in his CXR and subjective dyspnea.
He was continued on his Lovenox for anticoagulation and was also given IV Lasix for gentle diuresis.
Given concern for post-obstructive pneumonia/pneumonitis, especially with increasing WBC, he was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for HCAP coverage.
The drainage from his chest tube had decreased substantially and was removed by IP prior to discharge.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended observation with repeat echocardiogram which were performed.
Patient has known history of pulmonary emboli on anticoagulation with LMWH and no evidence of prior coronary disease or cardiac history.
He was started on metoprolol and up titrated to 25mg TID.
We continued anticoagulation with Lovenox for his known PEs.
# NSCLC: Mr. [**Known lastname 108423**] is a pt of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who preferred to hold off starting chemotherapy during this admission.
