Ms. [**Known lastname 41317**] poylp was found in the distal ascending colon at the hepatic flexure on surveillance colonoscopy and was unresectable by scope.
Risks and benefits of watchful waiting versus surgical excision were discussed.
To prevent of transformation to cancer, a partial colectomy was offered and consent was reviewed and signed.
Past Medical History: - Colon polyps - ESRD from hypertension status post kidney transplant - Osteoporosis - Hyperlipidemia - Immune suppression from transplant - Thromboembolic disease of the left lower extremity, on coumadin  Past Surgical History: - Cadaveric renal transplant from a pediatric kidney on [**2150-6-23**] - Partial colectomy for colonic polyps - Thyroid resection for benign disease - Ventral hernia repair - Ichemic left leg s/p common femoral and profunda endarterectomy, SFA embolectomy, four compartment fasciotomies - Peritoneal dialysis with catheter placement and removal.
Mildly distended loops of bowel in upper abdomen are incompletely evaluated on the chest radiograph examination which could be more fully assessed with standard abdominal views if warranted clinically.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] an uneventful right colectomy on [**2151-6-25**].Inraoperatively, she developed afib with rvr and was treated with IV lopressor.
Tachycardia was managed with po lopressor with IV lopressor for refractory tachycardia.
She was restarted on coumadin on POD#2, however this was held on POD#[**2-24**] due to elevated INR.
On POD#3, she developed an ileus and IV lopressor was used for rate control.
On POD#4, she developed tachycardia resistant to IV lopressor and received IV diltiazem with good response.
After discussion with the patient and her cardiologist, cardioversion was recommended after TEE.
Two IVs were placed, patient was ventilated by bag-mask with O2 return to 95%, Iv diltiazem was given with good response, Iv dilaudid was given for pain, 40 mg IV lasix were given for ?pulmonary edema from cardioversion, and foley was placed.
Overnight, she was rate controlled on an amiodarone drip and given methylene blue with resolution of cyanosis.
She was cardioverted again on POD#6 and started on po amiodarone and lopressor since ileus resolved.
GI: Ms. [**Known lastname **] felt well postoperatively with minimal pain, well controlled with IV dilaudid.
She was switched to po dilaudid on POD#2 and tolerated clear liquid diet.
She was again made NPO, and all medications were changed to IV route with Transplant nephrology and Cardiology consultation.
She will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2819**] for removal of staples and postop follow up.
Renal/GU: Ms. [**Known lastname 41317**] immunosuppresive therapy was continued postoperatively with the guidance of her transplant nephrologists.
Heme/ID: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was maintained on bactrim prophylaxis postoperatively, although it was held during her ileus after consultation with transplant nephrology.
Postop INR was 1.4 and coumadin was restarted on POD#1.
INR increased from 1.5 on POD#3 to 3.6 on POD#4, so coumadin was held.
Bactrim was thought to be interacting with coumadin levels and was changed from DS to SS.
Patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8338**] on [**2151-7-5**] for coumadin dosing after recheck of INR.
