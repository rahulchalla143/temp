Got vitamin K 10 mg PO x 1 for ?INR > 5 (no record available).
Orthopedics placed a long leg splint, planned to take him to the OR tomorrow for ORIF, recommended anticoagulation reversal for procedure with FFP and vitamin K. In the ED, he received his scheduled lamotrogine 125 mg, gabapentin 1200 mg, zonisamide 200 mg, as well as hydromorphone 1 mg IV for pain control.
Admitted to OMED for further management.
He underwent surgical intramedullary fixation on [**11-3**], and his course has been complicated by difficult to control seizure activity and suspected aspiration pneumonia.
After surgery, he had hypoxia requiring NRB which was eventually weaned to nasal cannula.
Patient was started on HCAP coverage with vanc/cefepime/flagyl and continued on anticoagulation for his AVR and questionable PE.
His respiratory status improved over the next few days to lower nasal cannula oxygen requirements and was briefly stable on room air earlier in the day prior to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission.
Patient has been followed by neuro oncology and is currently on levetiracetam, zonisamide, lorazepam, lacosamide, gabapentin, lamictal and PRN ativan for breakthrough.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient is able to answer some questions but has baseline expressive aphasia and periods of somnolence which limit his ability to respond.

Pain control with dilaudid and tylenol.
Dexamethasone was continued and neuro/oncology was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding initiation of further chem/thoughts on prognosis.
Decision was made not to initiate tube feeds or TPN.
Complex antiepileptic regimen with levetiracetam, zonisamide, lorazepam prn, lacosamide, lamotrigine, and gabapentin.
