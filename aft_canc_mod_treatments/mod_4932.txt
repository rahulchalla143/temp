Nevertheless, if this diagnosis is suspected clinically, presumably, the patient is already receiving prophylactic acyclovir.
ADDENDUM AND COMMENT: There is mild high T2 signal within the mastoid sinus complexes as well, likely indicating an ongoing inflammatory process as well.
Patient hypercarbic and hypoxic, intubated at [**Location (un) 620**] and maintained here with low NIFs and difficulty weaning (when pressure support lowered would become tachypneic).
Treated for PNA and COPD he improved and despite low NIFs, respiratory status improved with treatment and the weaning of sedation.
Before leaving the ICU he tolerated oxygenation by nasal cannula.
On presentation to the floor, the patient was satting above 90% on room air, and thus will not require home oxygen supplementation.
The patient is being discharged home on CPAP at night, Advair, Tiotropium and Albuterol PRN.
For CAD, the patient was started on low dose Statin given transaminitis, Metoprolol and Aspirin 81mg.
During the stay the patient has been switching between assist control and pressure support ventilation (while intubated) ??????
due to desynchrony with ventilator and tachypneic episodes.
Attempts to reduce pressure support typically resulted in tachypnea to the 30s-40s.
PNA was quite possible based on thick secretions, cough, (he received an empiric course of Levaquin and Ceftriaxone) but CXRs are now clear and sputum examination has not been fruitful.
He has been successfully extubated, but was 86% on nasal [**Last Name (un) 23350**] at 5 L on [**2117-1-12**].
In view of target O2 of 88-92 %, successfully on nasal cannula on [**2117-1-13**] at 5 L and around 90-95% O2Sat.
