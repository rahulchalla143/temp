Admission Date:  [**2182-7-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2182-8-12**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**] Chief Complaint: Fall and SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization   History of Present Illness: 89yo CM with PMHx significant for CAD s/p incomplete atherectomy and PCA ([**1-27**]), and recent echo ([**7-27**]) demonstrating CHF (EF: 25-30%), moderate AS (valve area 1.0), mild->mod AR, mod MR, mod TR, and mild pulm artery systolic HTN as [**Doctor Last Name **] as DM2, and CKI (baseline Cr ?2-2.7) who was admitted to the ICU for managment of altered mental status in the setting of hypervolemic hyponatremia.
Prior to his admission the patient had been gaining weight (from 172 lbs to 180 lbs) and had B/L effusions on CXR, which prompted his PCP to increased his Toresimide on [**7-12**] from 10 mg to 20 mg in the AM and 5 mg to 10 mg in the PM.
On day of admission the patient was leaning over to put on his slippers and fell over.
He was placed on a lasix drip and diuresed about 6L, taking into consideration the need to not decrease his preload in the setting of AS in order to maintain his CO. Renal was consulted for his elevated Cr, which occurred likely secondary to poor forward flow state and suggested an SPEP/UPEP, which was negative for Bence [**Doctor Last Name **] protein.
His lasix drip was d/c and he continued to auto-diurese.

His serum sodium improved with diuresis and free water restriction to 1.5L/day.
He initially received aggressive diuresis and was taken to the cath lab [**2182-8-6**] where he had 3 stents placed in LAD which was 90% stenosed.
He continued to be diuresed with 40mg IV lasix [**Hospital1 **] until we felt he was euvolemic.
He was then restarted on home dose of torsemide.
LE remains [**1-19**]+ but improving with elevation and compression stocking.
#Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury: Mild elevation of Cr from baseline 2.2 to 2.6 felt to be secondary to heart failure exacerbation.
Improved w/ diuresis and pt returning to euvolemia.
Cardiac cath was performed on [**8-6**] as mentioned above with 3 stents placed in his highly diseased LAD.
Metoprolol increased to 25mg [**Hospital1 **].
He remains on ASA 325 and atorvastatin 80mg daily.
At time of discharge pt was still requiring 2L oxygen to maintain adequate sats with any exertion.
# DM: We held the patient's glipizide and began insulin with sliding scale adjustment and regular accuchecks.
Glipizide should be restarted at time of discharge.
His treatment for this was discontinued during his 3 week hospitalization, but it should be restarted as an outpatient.
Pt was prescribed an alternative regimen [**2-19**] to needing to be off PPI while on [**Month/Day (2) 4532**] and issues with clarithromycin and other current drugs.
