Admission Date: [**2184-12-28**]        Discharge Date: [**2185-1-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2122-5-16**]        Sex:  M  Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old male who was diagnosed with esophageal cancer and underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation for locally advanced disease.
He presents now for resection of his tumor.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Esophageal cancer as above status post laparoscopy, Port-A-Cath placement, J tube placement, status post chemoradiation.
Levaquin for recent question pneumonia.
The procedure was uncomplicated and his postoperative course was summarized as follows:  Neurologic:  His pain initially was controlled with an epidural and then with a PCA with transition to oral medications.
He is now back on all his preoperative pain medications at the slightly higher doses, and in addition, is on a clonidine patch.
He remains on beta- blockers with good heart rate and blood pressure control.
His last sputum culture grew gram-negative rods and there was a question of possible infiltrate on a CT scan and therefore is being treated with levofloxacin.
Since postoperative day one, he has been on tube feeds, which have been increased slowly to goal and is now getting cycled tube feeds at night, which include ProBalance at 85 cc an hour from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.  GU:  Patient's renal function has remained normal at all times and his urine output has been good.
Heme:  During his stay here, the patient was kept on subcutaneous prophylactic Heparin to prevent DVT.
Throughout his hospitalization, he required only 1 unit of blood on postoperative day two for a low hematocrit and tachycardia.
Cultures were drawn and the line was removed.
Given the culture results, he is being treated with Vancomycin since IV through his port.
He has remained afebrile since and our hope is to complete a two week course of antibiotics through the port, which hopefully can be saved and shows no signs of infection at this time.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is discharged in stable condition to a rehabilitation facility with the following recommendations: Continue cycled tube feeds and at the same time advance by mouth intake with supplements and diet.
Continue Vancomycin for a total of two week treatment.
Continue current pain control with followup with the Chronic Pain Service in order to manage his pain issues and consult these treatments.
