Heparin IV started, head CT with IV contrast did not show any evidence of brain metastesis, and the patient was transitioned to coumadin.
However, given evidence of small but enlarging pericardial effusion on TTE, anticoagulation was discontinued prior to discharge given concern for high risk of bleeding into a potentially malignant effusion.
Cardiac: Inferior ST elevations seen on EKG following administration of epinephrine for bradycardia and hypotension.
Cardiology was consulted on [**2164-1-5**] and the patient was started on a nicardipine drip to treat coronary vasospasm.
On [**2164-1-6**], per cardiology, patient started on ASA, CCB PO, Lisinopril and statin.
Beta blocker was held to allow for reflex tachycardia in setting of PE.
