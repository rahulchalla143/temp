Admission Date:  [**2118-7-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-8-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-9-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ace Inhibitors / Clindamycin / Warfarin / Ativan / Zosyn  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30158**] Chief Complaint: hyperkalemia and fever of unknown origin    Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tunneled dialysis catheter placed by interventional radiology  History of Present Illness: 59M with hx of Alport's syndrome, ESRD on HD three times a week who presented to the ED with hyperkalemia.
This was most likely due to the fact he skipped a dose of dialysis (missed friday).
Per renal notes, pt receives HD at [**Hospital3 **] three times a week.
He was found to be febrile and hypotensive with a leukocytosis.
Bld cx were drawn and antibiotics were started.
During that time, pt's AV fistula in his right arm clotted off and remained so despite a thrombectomy so a temporary?
HD catheter was placed.
Per notes, pt completed course of Vancomycin for presumed bacteremia.
The patient was given one amp of IV calcium gluconate and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ER.
He received Calcium gluconate, Insulin/D50, one amp of bicarb and Kayexalate.
For his fever, cultures were drawn from his dialysis catheter, cdiff sent and he was on vancomycin dosed by levels for < 15.
He developed Afib with rates to 150's, he was given an additional beta-blocker which helped.
Past Medical History: * Alport's syndrome leading to ESRD and hearing impairment * s/p failed renal transplant at age 16 * Diabetes * adrenal insufficiency * hx of L1/L2 discitis and epidural abscess * hx of subacute cerebral infarcts * squamous cell carcinoma * CHF (per [**Hospital3 **] records EF 20%) * Hypertension * diverticulosis   Social History: ALL: ACE-I, Clindamycin, Lorazepam, Warfarin ?
Absent bilateral native kidneys and atrophic-appearing transplant kidney, right pelvis.
There has been interval increase in thickness of the right paratracheal and mediastinal soft tissue probably combination of azygos vein distention, mediastinal fat deposition, and some increase in central adenopathy.
Patient had recently finished a three week course of vancomycin from presumed bacteremia from AV fistula, but per [**Hospital3 **], all blood cultures sent were negative.
During that hospital course at [**Hospital3 **] he had a temporary HD catheter placed.
On admission, it was thought initially that the patient had a HD catheter infection.
The patient was maintained on vancomycin had his catheter replaced and the tip sent for culture.
Infectious disease, recommended removal of HD catheter x 48 hours (after it was already changed on admission, given continued fever spikes), but patient refused.
They felt once all other infectious etiologies were ruled out, we could consider an incision and drainage of the phlegmon and/or a debridement.
Other infectious work up during hospital course included a trans-thoracic echocardiogram which was negative for valvular vegetations, ultrasound of chest wall (where HD catheter was) which was negative for absess, ultrasound of left upper extremity deep veins that demonstrated DVT in left IJ, initial CT thorax that did not demonstrate any absesses, but revealed bilateral pulmonary consolidation and pleural effusions, which likely represent fluid overload (although are considering other etiologies on differential), bone scan, WBC scan (revealing pneumonia), bronchoscopy, and an MR of the shoulder (possible effusion noted).
As the patient's fever curve worsened, while waiting for bronchoscopy results, he was empirically started on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl.
Initially per infectious disease, patient was maintained on vancomycin, but was not broadened as to not mask etiology of infection.
Later in his course all antibiotics were stopped such that the patient's fever curve and cultures could be followed off antibiotics.
Eventually with a source of pneumonia, and the patient having increased fevers, it was decided the patient needed to be covered and was started on broad spectrum antibiotics while cultures were pending.
In the ICU, he was started on metoprolol, and converted back to normal sinus rhythm.
He was maintained on metoprolol throughout hospital course.
Initially, anticoagulation was held due to possible coumadin allergy.
Deferred initiation of coumadin to outpatient setting (as patient was only in atrial fibrillation for short time period).
3) Hyperkalemia: His hyperkalemia resolved status post dialysis, kayexylate, calcium/bicarb and insulin.
His hyperkalemia on admission was attributed to the fact that he had recently missed dialysis and that his dialysis catheter was not functioning properly.
There was a questionable allergy to coumadin noted in the chart, so while this was being confirmed, anticoagulation was postponed.
We felt that the patient's allergy to coumadin was unlikely (after further investigation) and therefore started a heparin drip.
He should start coumadin as well in the future prior to hospital discharge.
We did not restart hydralazine as the patient's blood pressures were normal, and we were unsure if this was needed (he is on hydralazine and not isosorbide at home, so less renal benefits).
He refused central line placement, so his HD catheter was used for central access.
He received a one liter fluid bolus and his bp remained stable in the 120s for the rest of his MICU stay.
His steroids were increased to prednisone 40 mg given hx adrenal insufficiency.
The patient at that time decided with his family to discontinue further aggressive medical care, and be made comfort measures only.
He understood the implications, and despite the slim chance that continued aggressive treatment might have resulted in significantly prolonging his life, he wished to be made Comfort Measures Only.
