[**2186-10-20**]  FDG TUMOR IMAGING (PET-CT)  METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation correction and for fusion with emission PET images.
A series ofoverlapping emission PET images was then obtained.
The patient, after having his 2 procedure completed, underwent extensive screening for a rehabilitation center.
