Admission Date:  [**2184-9-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-10-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2115-11-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: Weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: NA  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 28253**] is a very pleasant 68 year old man with past medical history significant for stage III, squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, he is status post radiation with IMRT and six weeks of Erbitux in [**2184-5-31**].
He is s/p radiation therapy and therapy with cetuximab.
METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation correction and for fusion with emission PET images.
A series of overlapping emission PET images was then obtained.
There is low level FDG-avidity of the muscles and soft tissue in the posterior part of the neck and also in the base of the neck which is most likely secondary to radiation therapy (Images 57-62).
Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.
When patient arrived on [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was satting at 95-100% on 50% FiO2.
Mr. [**Known lastname 28253**] was initially double covered for pseudomonas with cefepime and cipro, but later the antibiotics were changed to vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl and levofloxacin for coverage of GPCs in sputum; anaerobes from aspiration; and double coverage for pseudomonas.
On the night of [**9-17**], he became more and more tachypneic and was tiring with increasing work of breathing, and ABG showed worsening hypoxia, so we intubated Mr. [**Known lastname 28253**]; this intubation was somewhat difficult per report of anesthesia, with requirement for fiber optic visualization to successfully complete the intubation.
His subsequent intubation pre-tracheostomy was done in the OR and difficult anatomy was again visualized.
He was ultimately extubated after some difficulty with cuff leak; after steroids were administered he had a cuff leak and was extubated.
A mechanical insufflator-exsufflator was used frequently to help with secretions because of his difficulty with coughing; this was helpful but he continued to have significant difficulty with secretions.
After discussion with the patient and his wife, a tracheotomy was performed and trach tube put in place on [**10-2**].
A tortuous and unusual anatomy was appreciated by the ENT service who performed this, assumed to be secondary to his cancer and to radiation and chemotherapy to treat it.
His antibiotic course during the hospitalization for pneumonias was as follows: [**9-16**]: vancomycin and cefepime started for initial coverage of pneumonia.
[**9-18**]: levofloxacin and flagyl were started for double coverage of pseudomonas, and increased coverage of anaerobes.
[**9-22**]: flagyl was stopped.
[**9-24**]: vancomycin and cefepime course completed.
[**9-25**]: levofloxacin was completed.
[**10-2**]: Cefazolin x3 doses in 24 hours peri-operatively for trach placement, per ENT recommendations.
[**10-4**]: Stopped cefepime, flagyl, cipro; vancomycin was continued for GPCs ultimately shown to be MRSA in his sputum.
His home hydrochlorothiazide was not restarted.
He is s/p XRT and cetuximab, last dose [**2184-6-21**].
Surgery has thus far been deferred, consistent with current standards of care for SCC of the throat which at least initially avoids surgery while assessing response to chemotherapy and radiation.
Swallowing and effective cough remain difficult for Mr. [**Known lastname 28253**].
His need for help with secretions decreased somewhat with trach tube but he does continue to need suctioning.
Daily lisinopril was started.
One-time doses of lasix were given at various times to remove volume in order to improve his respiratory status.
He later had hypertension, and was initially treated with hydralazine and then had beta-blocker restarted.
He was also started on lisinopril 5 mg daily.
We continued ASA 325mg daily.

Post-radiation laryngeal anatomical changes Secondary: -Stage III throat cancer -Hypertension   Discharge Condition: At the time of discharge patient's tracheostomy had been changed, he was breathing comfortably on trach collar, he had a PICC placed for antibiotic administration, was afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating his tube feeds at goal and considered medically stable for discharge to pulmonary rehab.
You were initially treated with anti-biotics.
However, your breathing worsened, you were transferred to the ICU and ultimately intubated to help with your breathing.
After further antibiotic treatment your breathing improved and you were able to be successfully extubated.
Again your breathing worsened, so the ENT doctors came to [**Name5 (PTitle) 788**] you and recommended a tracheostomy to help you breath more easily.
On [**2184-10-2**] the ENT doctors took [**Name5 (PTitle) **] to the operating room and placed a tracheostomy in your neck; after the procedure your breathing improved considerably.
As a result you needed to have PICC line (which is a special type of IV) placed to complete 14 days of antibiotic treatment with vancomycin.
Changes made to your medication regimen: 1.
Added Vancomycin 1g every 12 hours to finish on [**2184-10-16**] 2.
Added Lisinopril 5mg daily to help with your blood pressure 3.
Stopped Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily because you had some low sodium levels.
**Continue to take all other medication as previously prescribed.
