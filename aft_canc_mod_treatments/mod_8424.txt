Patient intially tolerated the procedure well, but post procedurally developed bright red blood per rectum and melanotic stools.
Patient underwent a second endoscopy which showed a large adherant clot at the site of the resection and 4mg of epinephrine was injected into the site with out obtaining hemostatis.
Per report patient was not on any blood thinning or platelet inhibiting medications preprocedurally.
An attempt to place a 16 gauge peripherial IV was made with out success and patient underwent emergent placement of trauma line in the right groin.
Vascular surgery was consulted and recommended removing the line and holding pressure.
Patient then had 9F trauma line placed in the right IJ for access.
A thrid unit of pRBCs was transfused while in the IR suite.

Duodenum: Other: Site of endoscopic mucosal resection in the duodenum is identified.
A submosal injection was performed using methylene blue and saline into the polyp to create a saline pillow.
The polyp was completely removed using piece meal polypectomy technique.
A submosal injection was performed using methylene blue and saline into the base of the 5 cm duodenal polyp to create a saline pillow.
The polyp was completely removed using piece meal polypectomy technique.
- IR procedure (preliminary): 1.
Fluoroscopic assisted right femoral access and retrieval.
MEDICATION:  Moderate sedation was provided by divided doses of Versed for a total of 4 mg and fentanyl for a total of 200 mcg.
At this moment, suspicion for a femoral artery line placement was raised, and as one of the lumens of the line was open, pulsatile blood was identified.
Subsequently, a Cobra 2 catheter was navigated over an angled Terumo Glidewire into the celiac trunk.
A Renegade microcatheter was navigated over a 0.16 Headliner into the gastroduodenal artery.
The [**Location (un) 6002**] technique was used, with coils and Gelfoam subsequently over and over.
Following this, the catheters were removed.
Patient tolerated the procedure well and was returned to the ICU in stable condition.
- IR guided RIJ triple lumen central line placement PROCEDURE: As this was an emergency line placement and the patient had previously consented to central line placement 2 hrs prior, no new consent was obtained.
After anesthetizing the skin and subcutaneous tissues, a micropuncture needle was inserted into the right internal jugular vein under ultrasound guidance.
The hard copy ultrasound images were saved; however, due to technical problems, not transferred to PACS.
A 0.018 nitinol wire was then advanced into the superior vena cava.
The inner cannula and nitinol wire were removed.
The micropuncture sheath was removed initially and 7 French dilator was used over the [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire.
Finally, the dilator was removed and a triple-lumen trauma line was placed with its tip positioned in the distal superior vena cava.
Dry sterile dressings were applied.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a triple-lumen internal 9F French trauma line through the right internal jugular vein approach.
Status post duodenal adenoma removal and GDA embolization.
Minimal stranding around the second segment of the duodenum and the pancreas, likely related to post-procedure, however correlation with biochemical pannel is recommended to assess for potential pancreatitis.
Stranding along the right inguinal region, post-central line placement, however, with no evidence of retroperitoneal or inguinal hematoma.

An attempt to place a 16 gauge peripherial IV was made with out success and patient underwent emergent placement of trauma line in the right groin.
Vascular surgery was consulted and recommended removing the line and holding pressure.
A thrid unit of pRBCs was transfused while in the IR suite.
He was maintained on a IV pantoprazole drip.
Hemoglobin and hematocrit remained stable, and the patient was discharged with GI follow-up.
Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q12H RX *pantoprazole 40 mg 1 tablet(s) by mouth twice a day Disp #*60 Tablet Refills:*2 2.
You were emergently transfused 4 units of red blood cells and had the bleeding artery embolized by our interventional radiologists.
You tolerated this procedure well and had no signs of further bleeding for 2 days afterwards.
You were seen by our vascular surgeons who removed the line and felt comfortable that it had healed properly.
