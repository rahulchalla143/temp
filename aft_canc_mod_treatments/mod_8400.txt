Hemostasis was obtained from a bleeding vessel around the pancreas and the aortic repair appeared to be intact.
Her hospital course was characterized by a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] course on multiple pressors, multiple abdominal washouts and takebacks for bleeding, placement of a vac and [**Location (un) **] patch to assist with abdominal closure, an NGT causing jejunal perforation requiring an omental patch, a J-tube, tracheostomy and eventual abdominal closure and weaning from the ventilator.
Neuro: She was kept sedated while intubated in the ICU on with use of propofol, fentanyl and initially (briefly) midazolam.
Her sedation was weaned intermittently and she would grimace and spontaneously move all four extremities.
On [**2139-5-4**] she was noted to have a left lateral gaze deviation on exam; given her sedation it was difficult to evaluate for other signs of neuro deterioration and therefore she had a STAT Head CT; it was negative for a bleed and EEG monitoring was started shortly therafter and was negative for seizure activity.
The left lateral gaze deviation was noted intermittently but self-resolved and did not return once her sedation was weaned.
After her tracheostomy on [**2139-5-9**], her sedation was weaned entirely, she was alert and interactive, smiling and grimacing appropriately.
Cardiac: She required multiple pressors initially, including neosynephrine, levophed and vasopressin to maintain an adequate blood pressure.
Her pressors were weaned as appropriate through her hospital stay with intermittent spurts of being off of pressors entirely.
She had several takebacks to the OR for washout of her abdomen and for intra-abdominal oozing/bleeding, around which her pressor requirement increased and she often required extensive blood, platelet, FFP, cryoprecipitate transfusions (see GI section).
P: She was intubated and required a ventilator for much of her stay.
Her endotracheal tube was exchanged for a percutaneous tracheostomy (done in the operating room during a concurrent takeback for a jejunal perforation) on [**2139-5-9**].
She was gradually weaned from the ventilator as tolerated and ultimately tolerated trach-mask trials on [**2139-5-21**].
She remained off the ventilator on trach collar until [**2139-6-6**] when her trach was removed.
Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she was taken back to the OR for a repeat ex-lap and repair of pancreatic bleeding/packing, also as noted above.
She appeared to be improving slightly, briefly off pressors but in the morning of [**2139-5-9**], during a bedside dressing change it was noted that her nasogastric tube was in her abdomen, outside of the gastic lumen with apparent perforation of her jejunum (recall that she is s/p gastric bypass).
She was taken to the OR for repair of the jejunal perforation with an omental patch and concurrently had placement of a jejunal tube (therafter used for tube feeding) and a tracheostomy.
She was taken back to the OR for a repeat washout on [**2139-5-14**] with an estimated 1 liter of clot/old blood removed, with the bleed/ooze originating from the liver bed which was treated with argon beam.
She returned to the OR on [**2139-5-15**] for a washout where the liver bed was again treated with argon beam and she was treated with Factor VII.
Nutrition:  While on pressors with an open abdomen she was initially NPO.
Tube feeds were started through the OG tube on [**2139-4-25**], slowly advanced to up to 30 cc/hr.
Because she was noted to not have good stool output and she was noted to have a significant ileus during washout procedures with some amount of instipated stool, the tube feed rate was kept at a minimum trickle of 10cc/hr.
She was placed on a bowel regimen and ultimately had several substantive bowel movements that cleared her colonic stool content (as evidenced on CT scan) but her small bowel continued to appear instipated on washout procedures; this slowly resolved but she was kept on trickle tube feeds to avoid overloading the small bowel.
She was started on TPN on [**2139-5-5**] and continued thereafter.
TPN was weaned off and TF were started and advanced to goal on [**2139-6-4**].
At the moment of discharge patient continue with tube feeds at goal, cycled.
She was started on CVVH on her second day in the ICU and this was continued until [**2139-5-26**] when she was transitioned to HD which she tolerated well.
H: She received numerous blood products on arrival and while in critical condition in the ICU.
As of [**5-15**], she had received 82 units of pRBC, 38 units of FFP, 20 units of platelets, 12 units of cryoprecipitate and one dose of factor VII while intraoperative on [**5-15**].
She didn't require additional transfusions thereafter Also, because of her bleeding/ooze episodes she was placed on an Amicar drip twice during this hospitalization.
She was initially on heparin prophylaxis due to her high risk factors for DVT but due to persistent bleeding concerns this was ultimately discontinued.
She had an IVC filter placed by interventional radiology on [**2139-5-19**], eventually re started and discharged on SCH  She did have extensive hematologic testing including measurement of factor levels and assessing for antibodies to platelets.
Nonetheless, she was treated with the PO/PR vanco and flagyl regimen.
S/p Splenectomy during the initial surgery, patient vaccinated for H Influenza, Pneumococo and Meningococo.
Due to her sepsis-like picture and later her gastric perforation, persistently elevated WBC count, and low-grade temperatures while on CVVH, she was placed on additional broad spectrum antibiotics and completed a course of vancomycin, meropenem and micafungin which were discontinued on [**2139-5-21**] after 2 weeks.
The PO vancomycin was continued until [**2139-5-28**] as prophylaxis against recurrent cdiff infection due to multiple antibiotic use.
