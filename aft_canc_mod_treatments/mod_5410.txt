Both ureters taper abruptly within a region of stranding and small bowel tethering in the pelvis, indicating that the ureteral obstruction could secondary to adhesions from prior surgery.
If this patient has had prior radiation to the pelvis, post-radiation fibrosis should be considered as well.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old woman with a past medical history of thyroid and metastatic [**Known lastname 499**] cancer currently undergoing current chemotherapy with FOLFIRI who presented with bilateral hydronephrosis and pyleonephritis, requiring brief MICU stay for septic shock.
E coli grew only from left nephrostomy tube during this admission, not right, though no definite stones seen on final read of CT abdomen/pelvis.
Positive UA on admission, hydronephrosis, fevers, leukocytosis and borderline hypotension to SBPs 100s-110s.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was initially started on Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone, but was transitioned to Vancomycin and Cefepime (for greater GU coverage).
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was hypotensive to SBPs in the 60s soon after placement of bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes (intraoperatively frank pus was noted from left kidney).
Ms. [**Known lastname 48642**] hypotension did not respond to 3L IV NS, and was transferred to the MICU where she was started on norepinephrine and vasopressin for [**Known lastname **] pressure support.
Pressors were weaned off the morning of [**11-16**].
Her urine culture grew pan-sensitive e. coli, so antibiotics were narrowed to oral ciprofloxacin on transfer to floor, and she will continue on ciprofloxacin for a total course of antibiotics of 2 weeks, last dose [**2194-11-26**].
[**Month/Day/Year **] cultures drawn after starting antibiotics remained negative.
Nephrostomy tubes will remain in place likely for at least 2-3 months; urology will determine whether or not she would benefit from internal ureteral stents as an outpatient.
Nephrostomy care instructions were given to patient.
Bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes were placed under IR on [**2194-11-14**].
# Metastatic [**Date Range **] cancer s/p resection Currently undergoing chemotherapy with FOLFIRI.
# Paroxysmal Afib: Coumadin held on admission prior to percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement, then restarted at lower dose in setting of antibiotics.
Metoprolol home dose was continued as well.
She will be discharged on warfarin 3mg daily, next INR to be checked at PCP office [**Name9 (PRE) 2974**] [**11-21**].
# DMII: Oral hypoglycemics were held in house.
Restarted on glipizide and metformin on discharge.

You were started on antibiotics, and nephrostomy tubes were placed in each of your kidneys to relieve obstruction in the ureters.
Your [**Known lastname **] pressures became very low after the procedure, so you were transfered to the intensive care unit, where you required medications to support your [**Known lastname **] pressure for 1-2 days, after which the antibiotics kicked in, and you improved.
The following changes have been made to your medications: - Please START ciprofloxacin 500mg every 12 hours for 9 more days (to treat your urinary and kidney infection) - Please DECREASE your warfarin dose to 3mg daily or as otherwise directed by your primary care doctor (the antibiotic can interact with your warfarin and increase the coumadin level in your [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] we have to monitor your coumadin levels closely while you are on the antibiotic)  PLEASE have your INR (coumadin level) drawn on Friday [**11-21**] at your primary care doctor's office, and they will instruct you with how to proceed with your coumadin dosing.
You have been provided with instructions on how to care for your nephrostomy tubes until your followup appointment.
