Pt was discharged [**1-11**] and saw Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 572**] in GI on [**1-13**], who felt the LAD was less likely infection, and more likely lymphoma, especially if the fever persisted on antibiotics.
Of note, pt was also admitted from [**Date range (1) 19971**] for hyperglycemia to 900s, thought to be [**2-7**] non-compliance with insulin [**2-7**] low PO intake [**2-7**] N/V thought to be [**2-7**] diabetic gastroparesis.
Previously on fludrocortisone and midodrine 3.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms:  Remains on PPI 5.
Coronary artery disease, status post 4 vessel CABG [**2129**]; -last stress (pyrimadole-MIBI) in [**2139**] with no anginal symptoms or EKG changes, no reversible defects -Echo in Sepetmber [**2143**] revealed LVEF>55% -Cardiac cath in [**2137-12-6**] revealed native 3-vessel disease, patent saphenous vein graft to third obtuse marginal, first diagonal, and right posterior descending artery, a patent left internal mammary artery with a distal left anterior descending artery occlusion.
Gastroparesis 8.
Approximate 30 pack year smoking history, but quit in [**2121**].
Lymphadenopathy may be reactive, however, lymphoma cannot be excluded and a followup chest CT eight weeks after antibiotic therapy is recommended.
Immunostains in the bone marrow to rule out minimal involvement by lymphoma are in progress and will be reported in an addendum.In summary the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings combined, are consistent with focal nodal infiltration by an anaplastic large cell lymphoma.
However, followup chest CT after eight weeks of therapy is recommended to assess the improvement.
Bilateral retroperitoneal hematomas seen tracking within bilateral psoas and iliacus (left greater than right) muscles.
Discharge labs:   Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 63 yo male with a h/o Type II DM, CAD s/p 4v CABG [**2129**] and Ulcerative Colitis who p/w fever/chills/NS/weight loss and enlarging peri-portal lymph nodes on abdominal CT found to be positive for anaplastic T cell lymphoma hospital course c/b NSTEMI and heart failure as well as pneumonia.
He was started on cipro and flagyl given PNA on chest CT and was shortly switched to Ceftriaxone and azithromycin given persistent fevers.
Overnight on [**1-22**], he desatted to 70s on 2L and required a nonrebreather.
Second set of cardiac enzymes was positive for NSTEMI and he was started on heparin gtt.
While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] several services were consulted including ID, rheumatology, and cardiology.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], his oxygenation improved rapidly with supplemental O2.
However, he continued to spike fevers despite adequate antibiotic coverage for CAP.
He continued to spike temperatures during this antibiotic course as well.
The last Ct chest looked better and antbiotics were stopped.
As the patient was ready to be transferred out of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the final pathology returned from pathology and showed anaplastic lymphoma.
The patient was initially treated with oral prednisone and his fevers resolved.
He was then tapered down on the steroids and the fevers returned.
Adriamycin was not given because of the patient's heart failure.
Cardiology was consulted who recommended aspirin, heparin drip, increased beta blocker for tight HR control, 80 mg of QD statin, and diuresis as patient had been fluid positive.
They recommended a cardiac MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4656**] for an infiltrative process in addition to continuing aggressive medical management.
ASA, plavix and sulfasalazine were stopped and the patient was given at least 12 units of PRBCs and 2 units of platelets.
He will need to follow-up with cardiology and eventually will at least need to restart ASA after the bleed is resolved.
The patient's liver function tests were also elevated and lipitor was held.
He is currently on losartan and metoprolol.
Spirinolactone was started and stopped after 1 week as patient was hyponatremic.
Once back on the BMT service, a CXR was done which showed a worsening infection despite antibiotic treatment.
As the patient was improving clinically with decreasing O2 sat requirement, they recommended completing the course of antibiotics and continuing to diurese the patient.
A bronchoscopy was considered to obtain more tissue, however, as the patient had a recent NSTEMI, they felt that bronchoscopy would be a high risk procedure and would be of low yield.
On transfer to BMT, his antibiotic regimen was Cefepime and Flagyl.
His antibiotics were changed on [**1-31**] to levo/flagyl.
Flagyl was d/c'd after one week since no aspiration on video swallow and levaquin was continued for another week.
He was several liters negative on 20mg IV lasix daily.
# DM: Severe and uncontrolled at home, associated with retinopathy, neuropathy, gastroparesis.
Takes NPH in home regimen (75 QAM, 30 QPM) but is not compliant with recent admission for BG 900s.
He was continued on NPH x qam, x qhs, and ISS with titration as needed to optimize BG control.
Sulfasalazine was discontinued when pt had RP bleed.
# Gastroparesis:  The patient suffered from frequent bouts of retching for which he was taking reglan and a PPI.
# GERD: s/p Nissen fundoplication.
He was continued on pantoprazole 40mg q24h .
This was initially thought to be due to intravascular depletion and NS was given.
Urine lytes difficult to interpret given heavy lasix doses.
He was put on fluid restriction, given lasix to poison the tubule and demeclocycline and Na stabilized.
It was also thought that effexor was possibly causing hyponatremia, so this was tapered off.
We also discontinued spirinolactone as this can cause hyponatremia.
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO Q12H day [**6-16**].
Metronidazole 500 mg PO TID day [**6-16**] 3.
Aspirin 81 mg Tablet PO once a day.
Atorvastatin 10 mg PO DAILY 5.
Venlafaxine 150 mg PO DAILY (Daily).
Sulfasalazine 500 mg PO BID 7.
Folic Acid 1 mg PO DAILY 8.
Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q24H 9.
Lisinopril 30 mg PO DAILY 11.

You were treated with antibiotics for the pneumonia and chemotherapy for the lymphoma.
Cardiology was consulted and you were started on medical management.
Please take all medications as directed.
For now you should not take aspirin, plavix, spironolactone or atorvastatin until you speak with your cardiologist and are told to do so.
Your effexor was also discontinued and you can discuss this further with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12375**] at your next appointment.
In addition to discussion of you cardiac medications and your recent heart attack, please also discuss obtaining a cardiac MRI.
