ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):     FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):   Brief Hospital Course: #Hypercapnic respiratory failure - Secondary to COPD exacerbation in the setting of narcotic analgesia and aspiration pneumonitis.
Treated with mechanical ventilation followed by noninvasive ventilation, high-dose corticosteroid taper, nebulized bronchodilators, incentive spirometry, and antibiotics as above.
O2sat mid-high 90s on RA prior to discharge.
#VP shunt infection - Given changes in mental status with an indwelling catheter, the patient was continued on broad-spectrum ABX and the VP shunt was removed [**2181-8-7**].
He was continued on vancomycin for CNS penetration to complete a 14 day course via right brachial PICC beginning on the day of shunt removal.
#RUQ fluid collection - Ultrasound-guided drainage of this collection at the OSH reportedly revealed purulent material, most likely an infected pseudocyst which formed at the distal site of the VP catheter.
A drain placed at the OSH was removed prior to discharge.
Peritoneal fluid was not consistent with peritonitis and culture grew lactobacillus.
The patient was treated with ceftriaxone and flagyl to complete a 14 day course per ID recommendations.
Was started on amlodipine which was uptitrated to 10 mg daily with improvement in BP.
Blood pressure should be closely monitored during steroid taper, and amlodipine may be decreased or discontinued accordingly.
#Prophylaxis - Given pneumoboots for DVT PPX, and PPI and ISS while on steroids.
