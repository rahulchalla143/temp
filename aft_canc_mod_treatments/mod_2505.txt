History of Present Illness: 50yo M h/o CAD, dilated cardiomyopathy, CHF, AVR s/p mechanical heart valve, presented to [**Hospital6 **] [**12-14**] c/o L flank pain x1d.
Abdominal CT showed bilateral renal masses:  Left kidney mass 7 cm, exocytic, lower pole and Right kidney mass 2.6 cm, w/ infarcted tissue in upper mid left kidney.
His pain was controlled with a morphine PCA and then dilaudid IV and his anticoagulation was switched from coumadin to heparin in the context of his renal biopsy.

For this reason his anticoagulation was switched to Argatroban and carefully titrated to effectively anticoagulate for his mechanical valve; his platelet count normalized.
Cardiac clearance was obtained with a combination of studies from [**Hospital1 18**] and [**Hospital **]; an echo here showed EF 20-30% and he was maintained on beta-blocker.
He was maintained on therapeutic argatroban and transitioned successfully to coumadin.
A right partial nephrectomy was performed on [**1-4**] while on coumadin.
He was placed in the ICU post-operatively for close hemodynamic monitoring in light of his complicated cardiac history; he remained intubated with a swan-ganz catheter, chest tube, JP drain, NG tube, and Foley catheter.
The NG tube was removed on POD 3.
He was transfused 1 Unit PRBCs for anemia (Hct 27).
He remained in the ICU for observation related to mobilizing fluid and concern for volume overload given his compromised cardiac output.
It was noted that he developed a contact dermatitis, presumably from the tape during surgical positioning; this resolved after several days with topical cream for comfort.
He remained stable and was transferred to the regular floor on POD 4 after the swan-ganz was changed over a wire to a triple-lumen catheter.
His pain control was transitioned to PO dilaudid.
The JP drain was removed on POD 5.
The Foley was removed on POD 6 and the triple-lumen catheter on POD 7.
