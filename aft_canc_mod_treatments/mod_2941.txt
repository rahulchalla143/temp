He also complained of chest pain with lateral ST depressions noted on EKG that resolved when he received nitroglycerin and 2 units PRBCs.
He was started  on a PPI drip and admitted to the ICU for further management.
While in the ICU, his atrial fibrillation was controlled with metoprolol IV and reinstitution of his sotalol.

On [**Hospital 57232**] transfer to the hospital floor on [**2146-10-5**], he had a transient episode of hypotension with a pressure of 85/58 when he was transferring from the stretcher to the bed, which was attributed to the patient having restarted his home dose of labetalol on the evening of transfer.
His labetalol was subsequently held (until the day of discharge) and his blood pressure stabalized.
The patient was treated with a total of 6 units of PRBCs with stabalization of his hematocrit.
His intravenous pantoprozole was changed to po and the patient's diet was advanced.
Pain improved with SL nitroglycerin and blood transfusions.
