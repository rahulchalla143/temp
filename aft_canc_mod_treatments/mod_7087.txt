5 minutes post procedure the pt reported chest pain [**7-19**] substernal chest pain with radiation to the back.
The patient continued to complain of chest pain.
He recieved 4 of IV Morphine at 12:40.
The patient continued to note pain and was given SL Nitro at 12:43 at which time he was triggered for SBP in 60s in both arms.
The pt was found to have bilateral PEs and started on a Heparin gtt, but then the patient had a drop in hematocrit.
After discussion with the vascular and general surgery teams, the heparin gtt was discontinued and an IVC filter was placed by general surgery, the heparin gtt was not restarted, with the thought of waiting 48 hours post procedure to reduce the risk of bleeding.
Prior to be transferred to the floor he flipped into A.fib with a rate in the 120's to 130's, which was new for him, he received 5mg IV metoprolol with an improvement in her HR to 100's, with a stable BP.
He continues to complain of shoulder pain, and has abdominal pain with movement.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: Incidentally noted are degenerative changes of the cervical spine with anterolisthesis of C2 on C3 and C4 on C5, with retrolisthesis of C3 on C4.

Brief Hospital Course: MICU course: 80M with HTN, Dementia presenting with chest pain following liver biopsy and found to have bilateral PEs on exam and hypotension.
# Hypotension: occured secondary to receiving nitroglycerin and IV morphine for treatment of chest pain.
The patient also likely bled into the liver biopsy site after being started on anticoagulation (see above CT abdomen report).
He was trasnfused one unit of PRBCs and demonstrated an appropriate response.
# Submassive Bilateral Pulmonary Embolism: After a non-contrast head CT was negative for large intracranial pathology the patient was started on a heparin gtt and admitted to the MICU.
His risk of mortality from residual clot was weighed against his risk of mortality from bleeding into the liver biopsy site and a decision to stop anticoagulation was made.
LENIs showed significant clot burden so an IVC filter was placed by general surgery on [**8-17**].
# Atrial fibrillation: When the patient arrived to the floor he was in atrial fibrillation, which was rate controlled with PO metoprolol.
This brought up concerns regarding the danger of re-initiating anticoagulation for the pulmonary embolisms and lower extremity deep venous thromboses.
After a discussion with the patient's family they decided to change the goals of care to comfort measures only.
Palliative Care was consulted and provided recommendations.The patient's pain and symptoms were controlled with appropriate medications and the patient expired on [**2196-8-21**].
# Clostridium Difficile colitis: prior to discussions of goals of care, a stool sample was sent for C diff toxin assay, which returned positive.
We did not initiate antimicrobial treatment as the patient was made comfort measures only.
