The patient's past medical history dates back to [**2172**], at which time she had a medical workup for abdominal pain, weight loss, and anorexia.
In [**2173-2-4**], the patient then had a retroperitoneal node biopsy done via a mini-laparotomy procedure which showed granulomatous lymphadenitis with noncaseating granulomas.
Her blood was tested and was negative for histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis.
As well, she had a purified protein derivative placed which was negative.
No steroids were started at this time.
The medications used to treat her Crohn's disease included prednisone, 6-MP, methotrexate, as well as Remicade.
Her cycles of Remicade were in [**2176-10-5**], [**2176-10-5**], and [**2177-3-7**].
It is not entirely clear to me at this time what the sequence of medical therapy was for her Crohn's disease.
She also had approximately a 6-month course of high-dose steroids for the Crohn's disease with a taper prior to starting her first Remicade cycle.
The patient then had an admission to the [**Hospital1 346**] from [**2-19**] to [**2177-2-25**]; at which time she was admitted for diarrhea, fever, chills, sweats, as well as bloating.
She was treated with ciprofloxacin, Flagyl, and stress-dose steroids.
On [**2177-3-12**], she had a Remicade infusion and felt well for a few weeks following that; and then, on [**3-20**], she was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1940**] in the clinic.
She then experienced recurrent fevers in late [**2177-3-7**] and was treated with ciprofloxacin and Flagyl from [**4-4**] to [**4-17**].
However, she came to the Emergency Department (brought by her husband) in the setting of having a temperature spike and her usual rigors, sweats, and lethargy.
In the Emergency Department the patient was treated with ampicillin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl as well as intravenous fluids.
She was admitted for further workup.
Also significant for uterine suspension in [**2141**], as well as total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in [**2144**].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Her medications on admission to the hospital included prednisone 15 mg p.o.
She is status post Remicade cycle on [**2177-3-12**].
She takes folic acid and an iron supplement as well.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies; however, it is noted in her history that in the past she has been treated with PENTASA and METHOTREXATE without good effect on her Crohn's disease.
Occasional alcohol one to two times per week.
Subsequent studies of her bone marrow and her peripheral blood showed that she had large cell anaplastic lymphoma in the peripheral blood as well as in the bone marrow.
She was subsequently started on bicarbonate.
The patient had a hematocrit drop from 39 to 29, and she was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells.
She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for approximately a 12-hour period of time for further management of her DIC; however, she was then returned to the floor because it was the feeling that the care she was getting on the floor was not significantly different from that which would be done in the Intensive Care Unit.
She received three doses of that as well as aggressive hydration.
She was also started on allopurinol and folic acid.
The question of tumor lysis seemed less likely given that the patient started to decompensate prior to receiving the methotrexate.
A discussion was had with the family on multiple occasions, and ultimately the family decided that the patient's code status would do not resuscitate/do not intubate; however, they chose a course of therapy that would include oral methotrexate.
They were unwilling to make the patient comfort measures only; and, similarly, they were unwilling to pursue a more aggressive chemotherapy regimen such as CHOP with methotrexate.
The patient was able to participate in all of these discussions regarding her code status and regarding her treatment of her large cell anaplastic lymphoma.
