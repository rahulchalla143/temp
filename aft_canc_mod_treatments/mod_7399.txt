The extent of the lytic vertebral lesions with soft tissue component was better characterized in the previous MR of spine dated [**5-7**], [**2180**].
Brief Hospital Course: 77 year old male with multiple myeloma diagnosed in [**2181-3-25**] who is now status post  recent hospitalization ([**Date range (1) 17333**]) for a T10 mass attributed to myeloma and treated with XRT on [**5-22**] and [**5-29**].
Mr. [**Known lastname 101667**] also underwent recent chemotherapy for multiple myeloma.
He did not undergo CTA on admission due to risk of contrast nephropathy with his underlying multiple myeloma and renal disease, but subsequently CTA showed large PE after aggressive pre-treatment for iodine contrast load.
Initial ABG showed respiratory alkalosis with 7.48/20/53, improved at 7.42/34/162 with supplemental oxygen.
In the ICU he was started on a heparin drip.
He received supplemental oxygen and kept O2 sats >93%.
Patient was bridged initially with heparin but changed to lovenox due to fluctuating PTT levels between 56 and 114.
He was treated with nebulizers and a steroid burst in the ICU with excellent improvement.
Plan was for a slow prednisone taper as follows: 40mg from [**Date range (1) 47643**], then 30mg from [**7-3**] to [**7-5**] and then drop to 20mg daily [**7-6**] to [**7-8**], then 10mg daily until PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] in late [**Month (only) 216**].
Also discharged with PRN orders for ipratropium and albuterol nebulizers.
He will hopefully continue to wean his O2 NC 3-4L supplemental oxygen over coming weeks, but may need eventual home oxygen.
For now, he will plan to continue Atovaquone instead of bactrim for ongoing prophylaxis.
# Multiple Myeloma:  He was recently treated with chemotherapy and XRT for his multiple myeloma and a T10 mass, but this is not an active issue on this admision.
He will continue to receive atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis, allopurinol for gout ppx, and acyclovir for viral ppx.
Medical oncology recommends that Mr. [**Known lastname 101667**] receives an mean platelet volume check (MPV) as outpatient.
Please note in rehabilitation facility on [**2181-6-30**] he should receive pamidronate 90mg IV over 90 minutes.
# Hypertension: Patient with recored history of hypertension with lisinopril and HCTZ listed as daily medications.
Per patient report does not take anti-hypertensives so compliance was questioned on admission.
Daughter and wife unable to provide medication reconcillation.
However, given his extreme hypotension from recent massive pulmonary emboli and normotensive pressures off of these medications he was discharged without need for ongoing HCTZ or ACE-I but he can plan to discuss restart with his PCP if BP changes emerge.
His blood glucose became elevated after he was started on prednisone.
While in house he had one episode of FBG at 328 and several 200s, but otherwise had normal FBGs.
Glucose will be managed at his outpatient facility per Humalog sliding scale insulin.
