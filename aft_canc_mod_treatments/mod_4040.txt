The patient underwent an endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography on [**10-7**] with failure to cannulate ampulla resulting in respiratory failure during procedure and intubation.
The patient was found to have bilateral infiltrates and pulmonary effusions, thought to have adult respiratory distress syndrome, required minimal ventilatory settings, though.
MEDICATIONS:  No medications at home.
Zosyn 3.375 four times a day.
Diprivan 20 mics per kg per minute.
Levofloxacin 500 q. day.

Interventional Radiology placed bilateral biliary drains, internal exiting with decompression of biliary ductal system.
The patient's bilirubin continued to be trending down and right internal hepatic drain was internalized on [**2115-10-21**].
Concern for portal vein thrombus as seen on CT scan.
Repeat right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed normal flow, no evidence of complete obstruction, although presence of thrombus could not be eliminated via this modality.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient was transferred after intubation from the endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography.
He was subsequently weaned from the ventilator and extubated on hospital day three, requiring nebulizers and respiratory toilet therapy.
Outside hospital reported positive ventilator related pneumonia, continued on broad spectrum antibiotics and defeversced on hospital day five without temperature spikes.
Unasyn and Bactrim were discontinued.
The patient remained on Vancomycin and Zosyn to protect for SBP.
