His wife called EMS and gave him ASA 81 mg x 1 due to concern that this may be a stroke.
His initial BP was also in the 180s, so he was given Labetalol 20 mg IV for blood pressure control in the setting of hemorrhage.
Right sided neglect- identifies his right hand as the examiners.
Less response to threat on right- possible right hemianopia.
Unable to assess proprioception and vibration due to comprehension difficulties.
Gait: deferred due to acute IPH  At discharge: HEENT: Bandage on left top of head, staples removed from drain procedures, no erythem or drainage surrounding site Pulm: CTAB CV: RRR Abd: soft, mild tenderness to deep palpation, +BS, PEG site c/d/i Ext: no c/c/e  Neuro: drowsy, opens eyes to voice, dense R neglect.

CELL BLOCK OF FNA OF RT SUPRACLAVICULAR LN FNA, right supraclavicular lymph node, cell block:  Tumor cells present consistent with adenocarcinoma of lung; see note.
[**8-23**] Head MRI: IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the left parietal intraparenchymal hematoma with apparent areas of restricted diffusion along the margins could represent artifact from blood products versus ischemia.
Right upper lobe mass measuring 6.2 cm in craniocaudal dimension traveling along a bronchovascular distribution with multiple lobulations, the largest of which is 2.8 x 2.4 cm in the axial dimension with confluent right paratracheal lymphadenopathy measuring 4.5(CC) x 2.5(TV) cm.
Nasogastric tube located within the stomach; however, side port is at the level of the GE junction and could be advanced as on prior CXR.
Right upper lobe mass measuring 6.2 cm in craniocaudal dimension traveling along a bronchovascular distribution with multiple lobulations, the largest of which is 2.8 x 2.4 cm in the axial dimension with confluent right paratracheal lymphadenopathy measuring 4.5(CC) x 2.5(TV) cm.
Nasogastric tube located within the stomach; however, side port is at the level of the GE junction and could be advanced as on prior CXR.
Distortion of the upper portion of midbrain on the left side.Rec.
VP shunt and nasogastric tube are identified, incompletely visualized.
A PEG tube is seen overlying the area of the stomach.
A VP shunt is also visualized on the right side.
Clinical correlation is recommended as this may represent this patient's usual background, but in the context of a severe subcortical disturbance, the usual regulators of background activity may be disturbed.
Frequent rhythmic bifrontal delta activity (frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity, FIRDA) was seen more frequently after midnight.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 y/o right handed man with a PMH significant for HTN and DMII, who presented to the ED with acute onset of right sided weakness, speech changes and confusion [**8-20**].
Patient was treated with IV mannitol to good effect and dexamethasone was increased.
He was tapered off the mannitol and remained neurologically stable.
The patient had a PEG placed on [**2195-9-8**].
After PEG placement the patient developed a mild ileus that resolved with conservative treatment.
Tube feeds were subsequently restarted and tolerated well.
The patient is now being tapered off the steroids as well.
He underwent an elective intubation and EVD placement on [**2195-8-22**].
Beta-2 microglobulin, protein electrophoresis were negative.
Given the patient's relatively severe neurological deficits due to the IPH, as well as the extent of spread of the cancer, the med onc team did not see a role for them to pursue any treatment at present.
Patient was empirically treated with IV levetiracetam and on [**2195-8-26**], the LTM showed some delta rhythmic activity in the frontal lobes however that resolved.
LTM did not demonstrate electrographic seizures and levetiracetam was latterly stopped.
Patient initially required nicardipine drip for BP and latterly transitioned to home meds.
Due to high tumour burden and edema, patient was started on dexamethasone and this was titrated down.
Patient ws treated with IV mannitol to good effect and dexamethasone was increased.
The mannitol was stopped and the patient remained neurologically stable.
Currently the patient is being tapered off of dexamethasone as well given he continues to remain stable neurologically.
Patient was initially very hypertensive an required a nicardipine drip.
Patient had hydrochlorothiazide stopped due to hyponatremia.
His home atenolol was changed to labetalol and he was continued on prior home meds amlodipine and lisinopril.
Patient was intubated for EVD placement on [**2195-8-22**].
An NG tube was inserted and tube feeds were started.
After the PEG was placed, the patient did not tolerate tube feeds well and developed abdominal pain and distention.
He was treated conservatively with increased bowel regimen and placing the PEG to gravity.
Due to poor glycemic control on dexamethasone, an Insulin IV infusion was started for tighter glucose control.
This was latterly stopped on [**2195-9-2**] and changed to lantus and HISS s/c and lantus was uptitrated.
Patient was treated with IV Cefazolin for prophylaxis when the EVD was placed and it was subsequently stopped when the EVD was removed.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: Large intrcranal hemorrhage secondary to hypertension in the context of bleeding cerebral metastasis s/p EVD and VP shunt insertion, PEG placement Metastatic adenocarcinoma of lung .
right homonymous hemianopsia; L gaze preference although eyes cross midline.
Grimaces to noxious on R, withdraws on L.   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for an intracranial bleed.
For the brain bleed it was necessary to place a drain to decrease the pressure within the skull.
Initally this was a drain to outside the skull and then it was changed to a VP shunt.
A feeding tube (PEG) was placed in order for you to receive medicines and nutrition safely.
Currently there is no therapy that they can recommend given your neurological impairment at this time.
