Therefore, the patient was admitted to have a right lobe wedge resection performed for pathologic studies.
The differential at the time of this surgery primarily included pulmonary [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease versus pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis.
At the time of admission, the patient was status post chest tube removal.
ALLERGIES:  Penicillin causes hives.
Potassium chloride 60 mEq qd.
Lasix 240 mg po qd.
Vitamin D 800 U qd.
Digoxin 0.125 po qd.
Elavil 50 mg po q hs.
Coumadin had been discontinued as of [**2167-12-9**].
At baseline, the patient is on 4 liters nasal cannula at home.
?F, blood pressure ranged systolic 84-123/45-91, heart rate range 103-140, respiratory rate 24, 89-95% on 4 L nasal cannula and shovel mask.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM - 1) PRIMARY PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, STATUS POST RIGHT LOWER LOBE WEDGE RESECTION FOR WORK-UP OF NEW RADIOGRAPHIC LUNG FINDINGS AND PROGRESSIVE DYSPNEA ON EXERTION:  The patient was initially treated with Flolan with a short course of inhaled nitric oxide treatment in the setting of her acute dyspnea.
Symptomatically, the patient improved and was able to be weaned off nitric oxide after a 48-hour course.
Given the overall poor prognosis in this diagnosis, the patient was maintained on supportive regimen including Flolan, doxycycline for its presumed effects on decreased metalloproteinase activity, and lasix to further reduce preload in the setting of increased filling pressures on the right side.
The patient was maintained on lasix with very impressive diuresis.
She was maintained on her PO regimen and was approximately negative 10 liters for her length of stay in the ICU.
The patient was continued on her digoxin with her dig level at 0.6 on transfer to the MICU.
3) HEMATOLOGIC:  The patient initially was on Coumadin for her primary pulmonary hypertension.
She was maintained on a bowel regimen with normal bowel movements which were reportedly guaiac negative.
In the setting of having had her chest surgery, she was given morphine sulfate on a prn basis, as well as po percocet, to which the patient reported adequate pain control.
Thereafter, the patient was maintained on Tylenol treatment prn for her pain.
6) PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was maintained on a proton pump inhibitor, as well as heparin subcu tid.
DISPOSITION:  To the floor with follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for potential treatment of her primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis.
