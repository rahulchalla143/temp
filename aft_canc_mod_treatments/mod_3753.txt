Status post small bowel resection with end ileostomy and distal terminal ileum connected to the lateral aspect stoma as a mucous fistula.
Catheter along the lateral stoma appears to follow the mucous fistula for a few centimeters before entering the peritoneum with the tip in the right lower quadrant.
Please note that wound vacuum drainage also increased after rectal contrast administration.
Persistent gallbladder distention, wall thickening, and pericholecystic fluid, with interval development of sludge.
Tunneled line placement [**2141-3-1**]-->removal [**2141-3-4**] Tunneled line placement [**2141-3-6**]     Brief Hospital Course: Severe Crohn disease with chronic obstruction from ileosigmoid fistula with perforation and terminal ileum at the fistula site.
The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, resection of terminal ileum, end ileostomy and mucous fistula for severe Crohn disease with chronic obstruction from ileosigmoid fistula with perforation and terminal ileum at the fistula site.
He then underwent a decompressive laparotomy with an abdominal washout.
He also had bilateral chest tubes placed for effusions so large that there were causing cardiac compromise.
Following the washout his events were as follows:  [**2-4**]: had bedside ex-lap with esophageal balloon placement (concern for compartment syndrome.
Pt required bilateral chest tubes for bilateral layering pleural effusions, with subsequent improvement.
[**2-6**]: milrinone weaned off, started TPN [**2-7**]: weaning hydrocortisone, no acute vents.
[**2-9**]: L chest tube removed originally placed on [**2-4**] for increasing pleural effsusions bilaterally.
And thought due to his previous hemodynamic instability this was likely ATN, supportive measures were deemed most important and dialysis was going to be necessary.D5W was continued at 75cc/h to replace insensible free water losses.
The patient was off of pressor support at this time with Vanco/Zosyn/flagyl/micafungin for antibiotic coverage.
At this time it was also noted that hoisbilirubin was increasing to Tbili of 2.5 and RUQ u/swas neg.
Trophic tube feeds were started on [**2-14**].
3 separate [**Doctor Last Name **] drains were placed in the pelvis and right and left paracolic gutter respectively.
[**2-19**] HD was begun Pt then tolerated trach collar well  Over the course next few days his antibiotics were removed 1 at a time and JP culture returned as VRE for which he was placed on linezolid.
Left JP was pulled on [**2-28**] and pt had a passy-muir valve/ PICC line placed.
A tunnelled HD line was placec on [**3-6**].
A 19F [**Doctor Last Name **] drain was placed at the bedside on [**3-6**] in the left gutter as more fluid seemed to accumulate there on previous vac changes.
[**3-7**] Zosyn was D/c'd leaving pt on Linezolid and flagyl.
[**3-9**] Pt received rehab bed and was discharged to rehab in good stable condition   Medications on Admission: BUDESONIDE [ENTOCORT EC] - 3 mg Capsule, Sust.
