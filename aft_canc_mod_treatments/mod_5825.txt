Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: autologous stem cell transplant  History of Present Illness: The patient is admitted for an autologous stem cell transplantation s/p BM harvesting as she did not have an adequate peripheral collection.
She is s/p 6 cycles of R-CHOP (last treatment [**2157-1-6**]),She relapsed 2 months following RCHOP.She was treated with  R-CHOP x 2 with minimal response, s/p ICE in [**6-21**] and [**7-21**].
She also was admitted on [**8-2**] for cytoxan and neupogen for stem cell mobilization.
Three peripheral collections were attempted without sufficient cells.
She ultimately underwent a BM harvest in the OR with successful colelction of sufficient cells for an attempted autologous stem cell transplantation.
Relapsed after initial therapy with 6 cycles of R-CHOP (last treatment on [**2157-1-6**], vincristine held secondary to peripheral neuropathy), s/p Rituxan x 2, s/p R-CHOP x 2, and s/p recent ICE [**6-21**] and [**7-21**].

Other sources of infection in a neutropenic patient such as fungal infection, for example aspergillosis or mucormycosis cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 y/o F admitted for Autologous Bone marrow transplant with CBV regimen for treatment of large B-cell lymphoma.
She is status post multiple chemotherapy regimens and a BM harvest in the OR after failed peripheral blood stem cell collection .
Lymphoma: The patient was admitted to undergo autologous stem cell transplantation with high dose chemotherapy with CBV therapy.
Admitted Day-7 and began chemotherapy D-7.
Etoposide, Cytoxan, MESNA, BCNU given with last dose 9/30.
Mucositis severe with difficulty swallowing secretions, hematocrit and platelets monitored and patient made NPO with TPN and fentanyl PCA for pain.
Mucositis greatly improved by [**10-31**], but unfortunately patient did not engraft as of day +17, ANC 150, with very slow progression of WBC, though given bone marrow would expect slower recovery.
Penicillin allergy, pt unsure if cephalasporin as well.
Treated with levofloxacin and vancomycin.
line site with erythema, pt still febrile, added flagyl to already broad coverage of cefepime, vanc, caspo.
flagyl started [**10-24**], DC [**10-25**].
[**10-26**] pulled subclavian line on right.
Patient kept NPO, TPN started, acyclovir, cefepime, and fentanyl PCA.
Anemia, thrombocytopenia- epistaxis.
nausea- zofran, ativan, and anzemet with chemo.
scopolamine patch attempted in addition to decadron 4 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Patient continued to have severe nausea which dissipated one into treatment but returned three weeks into treatment once patient attempted to restart PO intake.
She was subsequently placed on BiPAP, progressively worsening SOB and O2 requirement, and became more SOB requiring 60% FM with 6L NC to maintain O2 sat in the 90's.
Minocycline for coverage of some Nocardia species (other options cause marrow suppression including Bactrim, Linezolid).
She continued metoprolol 25mg PO BID, discontinued digoxin.
Her hemondynamic status was unstable and metoprolol was then stopped.
She also became hypotensive and bradycardic, ultimately requiring dobutamine and levophed with minimal improvement in MAP.
Family agreed to an autopsy to shed light on the cause for her hypoxia/pulmonary dysfunction as well as for the subacute worsening of hemodynamic status, decreased UOP, and elevated lactate.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4-6H (every 4  to 6 hours) as needed.
Zofran 8 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO three times a day as needed for nausea.
Potassium Chloride 20 mEq Tab Sust.Rel.
Allopurinol 300 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
Levofloxacin 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day   Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: deceased hypoxia cardiac arrest acute renal failure  Discharge Condition: deceased
