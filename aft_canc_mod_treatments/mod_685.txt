His recent admission was complicated by hypoxia, a pneumothorax s/p chest tube placement and removal and then urinary retention which ultimately resolved.
He states that the nurse over-reacted as his SBP typically runs 90's and that he requires oxygen at baseline.
Thoracic surgery saw the patient and remarked that he was more hypoxic than baseline.
Started on Vanc and Zosyn.
EKG showed deeper ST depressions and T wave inversion, trop 0.6 - > started on heparin for ACS vs PE.

Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed minimal disease of the LMCA, widely patent prior LAD stents, mild restenosis of OM1, and 100% occluded RCA that fills via LCx collaterals.
Patent prior LAD stent, mild restenosis of OM1 stent.
The patient is status post left VATS wedge resection of a spiculated left lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
Hypotension: The patient's initial presentation with hypotension resolved after receiving IVF boluses.
The etiology is unclear, but likely a mix of poor PO intake, resuming normal home anti-hypertensive regimen, and taking dilaudid for pain control post-operatively at home.
Low dose metoprolol was restarted as patient's blood pressure stabilized at baseline systolic values of 90s-100s.
This was thought consistent with recent h/o thoracic surgery, and given patient's low blood pressures, diuresis was considered but held.
It is also possible that troponin was elevated in the setting of renal failure.
Enzyme leak likely related to transient hypotension and not to unstable clot formation, therefore his heparin drip was discontinued.
Aspirin and plavix were continued.
Statin was held for transaminitis.
Metoprolol was restarted at low dose as the hypotension resolved.
Recent VATS: The patient was continued on tramadol and dilauded PO.
Hx PE/DVT: off coumadin but INR 1.8 on admission.
Not on coumadin due to past bleed while on anticoagulation in [**2125**].

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: hypotension, with associated NSTEMI, acute renal failure, and transaminitis  Seconary: s/p recent left lower lobe wedge resection   Discharge Condition: Stable, improved.
Due to hypotension, your cardiac enzymes, liver function, and renal function all showed evidence of temporary hypotension, which resolved with IV fluids and holding your blood pressure medications.
You are being dischared on a lower dose of your blood pressure medication: please take metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID.
Your cholesterol medication (atorvastatin) has been stopped temporarily, and your cardiologist will discuss restarting this at your follow up appointment.
