Troponin negative.
He was given a dose of IV Zosyn.
ENT was consulted, and recommended admission for surgical Tx the following morning and switching to CTX (2gm IV) for mastoiditis Tx.
He was given his evening dose of warfarin after clearance from ENT, with a plan for ENT surgery and ID consultation in the morning.
However, around 6:00am the morning after admission ([**2157-2-14**]), the patient had a GTC seizure requiring 12mg IV lorazepam to stop.
He was loaded with 1gm of IV phenytoin and his levetiracitam was increased to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] (from his home dose of 750mg [**Hospital1 **]).
He was intubated and maintained on a propofol gtt on and off.
His post-ictal exam was notable for spontaneous movements of all four extremities, but lack of eye opening/arousability.
After discussing the case with a Neurologist here at [**Hospital1 18**], they decided to hold off on reversing his coagulopathy with vitamin K or FFP.
He was given a couple liters of IVF for decreased urine output (and urine was dark on arrival here).
He was continued on his digoxin (level y/d was 0.86), and his home BB and CCB were held.

Initially presented to OSH in [**State 622**] with first-ever seizure [**2156-3-1**] ([**Hospital 624**] hospital in [**Location (un) 625**], VA; had been visiting his son) -- a GTC x 30-45min and post-ictal [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 555**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 167**]-hemiparesis, which resolved; reportedly negative MRI, echo, and EEG at the OSH, and a normal EEG here at [**Hospital1 18**].

Old right temporal lobe infarction   Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 627**] is an 86-year-old man with a complicated past medical history that includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**2143**], atrial fibrillation on Coumadin with a prior stroke and right temporoparietal encephalomalacia, history of small-bowel obstruction with a partial colectomy, temporary colostomy, and subsequent reanastomosis, who was initially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital3 628**] for a complaint of jaw pain and subsequent mastoiditis.
There, he was started on antibiotics and ultimately sustained a prolonged seizure requiring intubation.
He was at the time complaining of ear pain, and ENT had planned a procedure at the outside hospital, but he ended up seizing and requiring 12 mg Ativan which necessitated intubation and transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
He had been loaded with Dilantin and Keppra was increased to 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **].
At that point he was taken off of the dilantin and continued on Keppra.
He had no LP performed as it was felt that the risk of reversing his anticoagulation was greater than the risk of empirically treating him for a meningitis.
He was started on Vancomycin, Cefepime and Flagyl for his strep bacteremia and fevers and continued on this therapy until [**2-24**].
This was then changed to Ceftriaxone 2gm Q24h for 4 more days to complete a 2 week course of abx for Strep pneumo bacteremia.
He has currently completed all of his antibiotics and has remained afebrile.
Atrial Fibrillation: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 630**] was on coumadin for his Afib.
It was held on day 1 of his hospitalization as it was supratherapeutic at 3.3 and there was concern of a small area of intraventricular hemorrhage.
He was restarted on anticoagulation with one day of heparin bridging when he was unable to take PO medications.
HTN: Amlodipine changed to 10mg daily.
New wound care recs will sent with discharge paperwork.

Discharge Instructions:   You presented to a hospital with a generalized tonic clonic seziure in the setting of a lowered AED dose and a fever.
You received 12 mg Ativan to stop the seizure and required intubation for airway protection; you were then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for further management.
You were loaded with Dilantin and your Keppra was increased to 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Your current dose of Keppra remains at 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **]   You were seen by ENT service regarding your opacification in the left mastoid noted on MRI.
They felt that this was chronic inflammation and no current intervention was reccommended at this time.
Antibiotics were started for strep bacteremia and you completed a 2 week course.
No surgical intervention was necessary, but you did receive a NG tube for decompression.
Followup Instructions: Please follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 631**] within 3-4 weeks of discharge  Please follow-up with your PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 1-2 weeks of discharge                                [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **] MD, [**MD Number(3) 632**]  Completed by:[**2158-3-6**
