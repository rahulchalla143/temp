Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 22114**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of HTN, DM, ?chronic aspiration, and Alzheimer's dementia who was transferred from the ED intubated after presenting with hypoxia and tachypnea.
She was started on ceftriazone/azithromycin for community acquired pneumonia on presentation.
On her second hospital day her chest radiograph changed significantly with the consolidation in her left upper lobe generally resolving suggesting this was more consistent with mucous plugging and volume loss.
She was transiently intubated with reexpansion of a previously collapsed upper lobe.
Given that her pulmonary edema and large pleural effusions were likely contributing to her volume loss and respiratory compromise an attempt was made to diurese with furosemide boluses, to which she responded well with decreasing oxygen requirements, down to 4L NC at dischage.
Hypertension:  The patient has severe and labile hypertension and was continued  on an aggressive anti-hypertensive regimen at home including beta [**Last Name (LF) 7005**], [**First Name3 (LF) 14595**]-1 [**First Name3 (LF) 7005**], CCB, and ACE inhibitor.
Alzheimer's dementia:  The patient has severe dementia at baseline, but is on no treatment for this at home.
Code: CPR not indicated but intubation allowed - confirmed with daughter and granddaughter.
