History of Present Illness: 71 year old man with known unresectable pancreatic anedocarcinoma s/p palliative duodenal stenting in [**12/2140**] who presents with two episodes of hematemesis this morning.
He denies any fevers, chills, abdominal pain, change in PO intake, chest pain, lightheadedness, dizziness, palpitations, melena, or BRBPR.
He received a 250cc NS bolus and pantoprazole 40mg IV x1.
He was brought for ERCP on day after admission to evaluate his duodenal stent (?blockage versus eroding into duodenal mucosa as etiology of pt's symptoms), which demonstrated food impaction at the level of the stent, with no evidence of new or old bleeding.
Past Medical History: -Duodenal stent [**2140-12-30**] for stricture - inoperable pancreatic cancer diagnosed [**6-15**] s/p ERCP with stent placement, laporatomy with attempted Whipple, on gemcitabine (received 3 weekly treatments starting [**2139-9-22**], followed by a week off, then a fourth dose yesterday [**2139-10-20**]) - h/o SBO - h/o cholangitis ([**6-15**]) with Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, and Strep Viridans - h/o bacteremia with Enterococcus fecalis (Vanc sensitive) and Pseudomonas (sensitive to Zosyn) - s/p choecystectomy tube (fell out [**7-16**]) - Hypertension - ankylosing spondylitis - right kidney cystic lesion - Moderate Aortic stenosis - intermittent SVT - anemia - tinea corporis   Social History: Lives at Orchard care [**Hospital3 **] facility run by [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, sister also lives there.
KUB ([**2141-3-11**]): Moderately dilated loops of small bowel, with presence of air and stool in the colon, gas pattern worrisome for ileus.
## Acute blood loss anemia: likely due to malfunction of duodenal stent - q6h Hcts; transfuse for evidence of active bleeding - GI input appreciated; may require stent re-placement - active T&S; 2 large-bore PIVs - [**Hospital1 **] IV ppi - consent for blood transfusion - prn ondansetron for nausea - hold Lasix, spironolactone for now; give short-acting, reduced-dose beta-blockade .
## Possible SBO: per patient, last BM was yesterday; KUB shows evidence of possible ileus vs early SBO - NGT in place right now (clamped) - keep NPO for now and monitor serial abdominal exams .
## Pancreatic adenocarcinoma with duodenal stricture, s/p palliative stenting in [**12/2140**]; followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] - may get re-placement of palliative duodenal stenting by GI (as above) - prn Percocet for pain control .
## Tachycardia: unclear if this is true volume depletion given his pulmonary rales and history of SVT - ECG appears to show sinus tachycardia - will give reduced-dose beta-blockade for now and consider small NS boluses in addition to maintenance IVFs - check digoxin level .
## Systolic CHF (LVEF 45% in [**11/2139**]): has mild pulmonary rales on exam, though mucous membranes are slightly dry - hold Lasix and spironolactone for now, but consider resuming if Hct remains stable - reduced-dose beta-blockade as above .
## HTN: holding some of BP regimen as above; will resume once Hct is shown to be stable .
obstruction of stent vs erosion of stent into duodenal mucosa vs migration of stent.
With onset of feculent vomiting s/p ERCP, NGT was replaced to cont suction and patient was sent down for stat CT abd/pelvis which confirmed an SBO distal the stent.
Surgery was consulted who recommended conservative management (NGT to cont suction, NPO, IVF, serial abdominal exams) for 48 hours and if no flatus/BM at that point will take patient to the OR.
Plan to: - NPO, IVF titrate to UOP >50cc/hr - NGT to continuous suction - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] recs - slightly improved on [**3-15**] w/ conservative management, still plan for OR on [**3-16**] per surgery- will readdress on the day of planned surgery - ondansetron PRN .
# Pancreatic adenocarcinoma: Pt has known advanced stage pancreatic adenocarcinoma with duodenal stricture, s/p palliative stenting in [**12/2140**]; followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Plan to: - management of duodenal stent as above - further oncologic care per primary team .
Plan to: - monitor on tele - NPO with NGT to cont suction, so cannot give outpt BB/digoxin - standing IV BB for now - IVF as needed to maintain UOP>50cc/hr .
Plan to: - hold PO meds for now - standing IV BB .
# HTN: On toprol XL, dig, lasix, spironolactone as outpt.
As above, holding lasix, spironolactone and decreased dose of metoprolol in setting of GIB.
Plan to: - holding outpt meds for now as pt NPO - standing IV BB ============================= ============================= Surgery was involved from the day Mr [**Known lastname 16268**] was seen in the Emergency Room.
After conservative management (NGT, NPO, IV fluids) failed, it was decided Mr [**Known lastname 16268**] would require surgical intervention.
He tolerated the procedure well, and was brought to the ICU in a stable condition.
He was given normal saline boluses with little marginal improvement.
In the morning of POD1 ([**3-17**]), there was evidence of staining of his surgical dressing with bile.
He remained intubated until [**3-21**] (slowly weaned over the course of 4 days).
He remained NPO, and TPN was started for a short period of time to maintain nutrition.
On [**3-19**], there was a short time he was on a T-piece, and was given 1 Unit of PRBC for persistent tachycardia with good effect (for postoperative anemia).
Over the course of the next few days, Mr [**Known lastname 16268**] did well - we awaited return of bowel function, removed his NGT when its output was minimal and started him on sips once he was passing flatus.
He was seen by wound care for furthur care.
Cardiology was consulted - his digoxin was stopped and he was started on diltizem orally.
He was given 5mg IV lopressor x 3 with good effect; in addition, adenosine was pushed by Cardiology for rhythm determination.
Cardiology was called, who felt it was not necessary to make adjustments to his medication at this time; Mr [**Known lastname 16268**] was given 5mg IV Lopressor x 2 with moderate effect (SBP down to 100's).
The following morning ([**3-27**]), he had a CT abdomen which showed extensive pneumatosis; he was started on broadspectrum antibiotics and IV fluids.
He was started on a diltizaem drip, but his SBP dropped, and hence it was stopped and switched to Neo in the morning.
He was also started on a heparin gtt at a rate of 800 units/hour, with an intial bolus of 1800 units (goal PTT 50-60).
Throughout the day, he required an increasing dose of Neo to maintain his pressures.
His Neo gtt was stopped, and he was started on a morphine gtt.
