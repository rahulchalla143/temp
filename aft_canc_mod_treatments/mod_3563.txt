She also received a dose of levofloxacin, zosyn, vanc, motrin and zofran.
IP SUITE COURSE: Pt taken to IP suite for bronch, BAL done, received 50Fentanyl, 2Midaz, underwent a lavage, RUL notable for complete obstruction, 30min post procedure began to cough, notable for acute hypoxia O2 sats 79%.
MICU COURSE: Initially started on BiPAP with rapid improvement in ventilation and oxygenation.
Sedating meds were minimized and the patient was quickly weened to 2L NC.
The patient was continued on Vanc/Zosyn   Past Medical History: -NSCLC diagnosed in [**2168**], Stage IIIb, with mets to subcarinal and supraclavicular nodes; XRT/Chemo [**5-/2169**], Onc care at [**Hospital 1562**] Hosp (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 27009**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 66058**]) -Post obstructive PNA [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital [**2169-4-9**], bronch w/MSSA treated with zosyn -COPD ---PFTs: FEV1 of 74% predicted with a predominantly obstructive pattern on flow volume curves.
Bronchial epithelial cells, squamous cell, macrophages and   mixed inflammatory cells.
She is a 79-year-old woman with a past history of right hilar nonsmall cell cancer consistent with adenocarcinoma, concurrent radiation and completed treatment in [**2169-5-28**].
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Once on monitoring she was administered 2 mg of Darvon and 50 mcg fentanyl for IV sedation.
The remainder of the right bronchial tube was inspected and appeared normal.
The left bronchial tube was visualized and all appeared normal.
120 ml of sterile saline were instilled into the residual right upper lobe bronchus and 30 ml were aspirated back.
The patient initially tolerated the procedure well, however during the recovery she developed profound hypercapnia with pCO2 rising to 90 and pH associated with this at 711.
She was transferred to the ICU to the MICU-7 for BIPAP in order to blow off her CO2.
The patient tolerated the initial bronchoscopy well but shortly after the patient developed hypoxia and hypercarbia, likely a side effect of the sedation used.
The interventional pulmonary service felt that a stent would not be beneficial in her.
She will require close monitoring for this complication.
In discussion with interventional pulmonary, it was decided not to pursue drainage of the cavity given the concern for cancer recurrence and the creation of a non-healing tract from the puncture site, greatly increasing her pneumothorax risk.
It was decided that she would complete 6 weeks of antibiotics to treat her cavitary pneumonia.
She will follow up with her PCP and oncologist and receive a repeat CT scan after completion of her antibiotic course to evaluate for possible progression of her lung cancer.
Non-small cell lung cancer: The patient was diagnosed with stage IIIb NSCLC in [**4-4**] with chemo/rads treatment completed in [**6-4**].
In discussion with her primary oncologist, it was decided not to actively pursue cancer treatment at this time until the infectious process is resolved.
Further cancer treatment will be discussed at this time.
She will also follow up with the intervential pulmonary clinic after the completion of her six week antibiotic course to evaluate for interval improvement.
She was continued on her outpatient naldolol and her lisinopril was uptitrated with good effect.
Her anxiety was treated with very small doses of Ativan with good effect.
Back/Scapula pain: The patient is s/p surgical correction of a cervical spinal body fracture in [**1-5**] with residual chronic neck/back/scapula pain.
The pain was initially controlled with motrin was noted to be limited by her back pain by physical therapy.
Her pain was then controlled with low dose oxycontin with percocet for break through pain.

The interventional pulmonologists used a scope to look into your lungs and take samples for culture.
They felt that you would not benefit from a stent as it would probably close off more airways than it opened.
The best course of action is to take 6 weeks of antibiotics to treat the pneumonia and then re-evaluate the lung with another CT scan.
Please take all of your medications as prescribed.
