Admission Date:  [**2146-1-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-1-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-7-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: transfer for evaluation of pancreatic pseudocyst  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2146-1-14**]: ULTRASOUND-GUIDED PERCUTANEOUS CHOLECYSTOSTOMY ERCP [**1-13**] - stent placed in CBD   History of Present Illness: 73 y/o M PMH CHF, CKD, [**Hospital 2182**] transferred from OSH after prolonged stay [**Date range (2) 89630**] for evaluation of pancreatic mass and pseudocyst.
Patient was admitted to the surgical floor and underwent ERCP [**2146-1-13**] which demonstrated CBD obstruction and stent was placed.
Due to a dilated gallbladder a percutaneous chol was placed by IR [**2146-1-14**].
Patient was transferred to the TICU [**2146-1-16**] due to hypotension and required pressor support until [**2146-1-19**].
Swab from chol fluid grew MRSA and patient was covered with Vanc/Cipro but etiology of hypotension unclear and not felt to be septic shock.
Patient's course in the TICU was complicated [**Last Name (un) **], low urine output, pain control and pancytopenia.
Patient was on a lasix drip from [**Date range (1) 5553**] due to volume overload (pleural effusions).
Today his heparin was stopped due to thrombocytopenia.
Coumadin and aspirin were discontinued and FFP given for INR reversal.
While undergoing anemia workup on [**12-19**], patient suffered spontaneous R pneumothorax requiring management with surgical chest tube and eventual resolution per serial imaging.
Pulmonary function was further compromised by RLL/RML consolidative pneumonia that was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
Imaging also revealed a 6cm peripancreatic cystic mass with fluid that was noted to change in character on interval imaging suggesting evolving hematoma/hemorrhagic pancreatic pseudocyst.
Past Medical History: pancreatic pseudocyst CHF (EF 25-35%) chronic afib (on coumadin) mild AS mod AR infrarenal AAA (4.8cm) hx DVT DM2 CKD (baseline Cr 1.4) COPD on 2L home O2 hx multiple compression fx hx nephrolithiasis   Social History: Lives with girlfriend in [**Name (NI) 13011**].
Ambulatory with walker at baseline.
However, is not possible to exclude cholecystitis.
Two focal hypoechoic liver lesions, as detailed above, indeterminate by ultrasound.
The lack of dilation could mean that the percutaneous cholecystostomy tube is draining the biliary system, however this is uncertain as the cystic duct did not fill with contrast on ERCP and could be occluded and the intrahepatic bile ducts and hepatic duct have not dilated because the stent jsut recently migrated.
Recommend continued hydration and close monitoring of renal function.
ERCP [**1-13**]: The distal pancreatic duct was opacified with contrast and appeared unremarkable.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was not successful with a 5-4-3 catheter but was able to be accomplished a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
A 7cm by 7FR Cotton-[**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed successfully.
[**2146-1-14**]: ULTRASOUND-GUIDED PERCUTANEOUS CHOLECYSTOSTOMY   Brief Hospital Course: Overview of medical course: 73 y/o M PMH CHF, CKD, COPD presented to OSH for anemia (EGD demonstrated mild gastritis, refused colonoscopy) and hospital course complicated by PNA, pneumothorax and acute chol.
He underwent ERCP [**2146-1-13**] which demonstrated CBD stricture with obstruction and stent was placed.
A percutaneous chol was placed by IR [**2146-1-14**] for acute chol and swab later grew MRSA consequently patient was placed on Vanc/Cipro.
Patient was transferred to the TICU [**2146-1-16**] due to hypotension and required pressor support until [**2146-1-19**].
Patient's course in the TICU was complicated by [**Last Name (un) **], low urine output, pain control and pancytopenia.
His urine output mildly improved with holding diuretics, [**Last Name (un) **] and giving gentle fluid but his creatinine continued to rise.
Pancytopenia most likely secondary to spleenomegaly and underlying disease but heparin stopped due to possibility of HIT.
Oncology was consulted who explained to the family patient is not a candidate for first line chemotherapy due to thrombocytopenia/renal failure and unfortunately no curable therapies.
- Pain: patient on chronic methadone prior to admission, increased during inpatient and started on standing oxycodone.
- Nutrition: patient was started on dobhoff on surgical service.
- Discharged on medications that provided [**Date Range **] during stay - change as needed.
****  Addendum; Prior to discharge, central line and dobhoff were discontinued.
Per phone conversation between [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2270**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1764**] of palliative care and staff at the receiving facility, pt will be transition to continuous infusion of subQ dilaudid.
