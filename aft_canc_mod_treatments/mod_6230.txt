She had a bronchoscopy with silicone Y stent placed and had an improvement in her symptoms.
However, this quickly resolved on subsequent chest x-rays and never caused respiratory compromise.
In regards to her code, she is DNR; she would want to be intubated only for a procedure or if it was temporary with maximum length of intubation until the morning of the third day; would NOT want to be intubated for a process like pneumonia; this plan was discussed with [**Female First Name (un) 27776**] by HO on day of admission.
However, we stopped her home Lasix because of SVC compression seen on her OSH chest CT and clinical dehydration.
She may need MRI of the head and spine at the [**Hospital6 5016**] before proceeding with palliative radiation to rule out brain and bone metastatic disease.
She was sent home on hospice care with pain, nausea, laxative, and respiratory care medications.
