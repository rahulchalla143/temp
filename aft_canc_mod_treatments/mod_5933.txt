Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam: (on arrival to the ICU, patient deferred a complete evaluation) Vitals: T 98.1, BP 88/60, HR 102, RR 20, SpO2 100% on 4L NC General: Pale and chronically ill appearing.
MICROBIOLOGY: [**2197-8-15**] SPUTUM GRAM STAIN-FINAL; RESPIRATORY CULTURE-FINAL INPATIENT [**2197-8-14**] SPUTUM GRAM STAIN-FINAL; RESPIRATORY CULTURE-FINAL INPATIENT [**2197-8-13**] MRSA SCREEN MRSA SCREEN-FINAL INPATIENT [**2197-8-13**] BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine-FINAL EMERGENCY [**Hospital1 **] [**2197-8-13**] BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine-FINAL EMERGENCY [**Hospital1 **] .
CXR [**8-14**]- IMPRESSION: Progressive infrahilar left greater than right opacification could relate to either aspiration and/or infection, with superimposed component of atelectasis.
[**8-15**] CXR-FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the right and left basal and perihilar parenchymal opacities, likely to reflect pneumonia, are unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 year old male who presents with hypoxia and tachycardia and was found to have presumed aspiration pneumonia and hyponatremia in the setting of stage II-III esophageal cancer receiving treatment with chemoradiation and recently admitted from [**2197-8-3**] to [**2197-8-8**] for cycle #4 cisplatin/5FU.
# Hypoxia: In the emergency department, the patient had O2 saturation in the low 80s and required supplemental oxygen with a face mask.
He was rapidly weaned to 4L NC over the first day of his stay in the ICU.
The first night in the ICU he again desaturated to the low 80s and required face mask for several hours.
The second day in the ICU his cough and oxygenation improved, and he was maintained on nasal cannula between 2-4L.
Treatment included antibiotics for presumed pneumonia (as below), hydration, and pulmonary hygiene to assist mucus clearance.
He was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics.
His hypoxia resolved while on treatment for the pneumonia.
Given his significant secretions, and his deferral of mouth care at times in his course, it is likely that he aspirates intermittently.
Antibiotics were started to cover possible sources of infection (vancomycin and cefepime).
Flagyl was then added for anaerobic coverage.
He did not have recurrence of hypotension, but did require IV fluids for hyponatremia related to presumed dehydration at a later point in his hospital stay.
His white count rapidly dropped to normal while on IV antibiotics for the pneumonia, and continued therapy for his [**Name (NI) 29218**] persistent infection.
Pt did have increase in diarrhea while on antibiotic therapy.
For this, vancomycin was increased to 500mg q6 while on IV abx therapy.
Plan is to decrease to 125mg QID for 2 weeks after IV therapy ends.
A Foley catheter was in place throughout his stay.
Viscous lidocaine was helpful at times of significant pain, although was not required as improved mouth care was achieved.
# C.diff colitis: The patient was started on PO vancomycin for C difficile colitis on his prior admission.
Therapy was continued as an outpatient.
This was continued during his stay, with a targeted 14 day course of therapy from the last day of antibiotic treatment.
His dose was increased to 500mg qid during his admission, when his diarrhea was noted to increase in frequency and there was concern for the need for ongoing IV antibiotics which could be worsening his [**Name (NI) 29218**].
Pt should be given IV fluids (normal saline) to meet goals prn.
The amount of water in his tube feed flushes was monitored, as were his electrolytes.
# Depression/Insomnia/Anhedonia:  On admission, the patient initially refused most medical care including vital signs, turning, and medications.
His home regimen of citalopram, Ritalin, and trazodone was continued throughout his stay.
Pt was given oxycodone and tylenol for pain control.
CT scan showed redemonstration of a cervical esophageal mass posterior to the thyroid and endoluminal soft tissue attenuation in the proximal trachea at distal end of tracheal stent concerning for tumor and secretions.
# Pain:  The patient's outpatient regimen of fentanyl patch and oxycodone liquid was continued.
# Nutrition: The patient's outpatient tube feeds were continued.
