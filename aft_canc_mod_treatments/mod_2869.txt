Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (3) 48551**] with a left leg infection in setting of multiple nonhealing fractures following an accident at work, treated with iv antibiotics, and currently planning for amputation.
He was again admitted in [**6-/2172**] with rejection and reaction to azathioprine.
The renal transplant team has been varying his immunosuppressant regimen to allow for bone healing as well as preventing rejection.
He has also been dyspneic on exertion due to progressive anemia and was recently started on erythropoietin injections.
He denies having had fevers, chills, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation.
Past Medical History: h/o type I diabetes mellitus s/p pancreas transplant [**2170-5-20**] ESRD s/p living related renal transplant [**2172-7-17**] Recurrent UTIs Blind in left eye d/t toxoplasmosis infection Occlusion of radial/ulnar arteries s/p eye laser surgery Diabetic retinopathy Neuropathy Fistula right arm   Social History: Lives with his parents; previously worked in a warehouse.
Brief Hospital Course: 31 yo man with h/o ESRD s/p living related renal transplant [**2168**] and type I diabetic s/p pancreas transplant [**2169**], admitted with acute renal failure/elevated creatinine, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and progressive anemia.
The neutropenia was considered secondary to tacrolimus / sirolimus toxicity.
He was initially started on cefepime / daptomycin for febrile neutropenia (vancomycin allergic).
He was provided opiate pain medication for pain control.
He was started on daptomycin and cefipime, when he was febrile w/ neutropenia before culture data returned and then transitioned to IV ampicillin.
Orthopedic surgery was consulted which recommended elective amputation.
He underwent elective BKA on the left leg.
ID was consulted on the patient to manage the enterococcal bacteremia; ID will follow his CBC and renal function to determine appropriate renal dosing of ampicillin if his renal function continues to improve.
He will continue on a course of ampicillin at home for 2 weeks from the date of BKA.
He recieved 15 mg of MSIR at 4am.
He had been given MSIR 15 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 6 days with occasional IV supplementation.
He was immediately provided narcan and a CODE BLUE was called.
His MICU course was notable for 2 additional doses of narcan for mild somnolence without frank respiratory depression.
His opiate dosing was changed to dilaudid to decrease the build-up of active metabolites.
Gabapentin was also used temporarily, which he tolerated well.
# Neutropenia Initially neutropenic, likely secondary to medications (rapamycin toxicity).
He was placed on neutropenic precautions.
His immunosuppression medications were lower after finding supra-therapeutic levels.
However, EBV viral load was measured to assess for risk of post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.
His IV dilaudid was stopped and he felt better immediately.
Blood levels of tacrolimus / sirolimus were checked and found to be markedly elevated (Tac 10.8; Sirolimus 13.6).
His home metoprolol dose was increased to 200 mg [**Hospital1 **] from 100mg toprol long acting.
He was transiently treated w/ PO and IV hydralazine.
He will continue to follow for BP control as an outpatient.
