A left upper mediastinal lymph node measures 11 mm in diameter.
A right upper paratracheal lymph node measures 25 x 18 mm (3:14); an adjacent one measures 8 mm.
Although it is possible that hydronephrosis is secondary to bladder distention, the possibility that the ureters are blocked by retroperitoneal fibrosis associated with malignancy should be considered.
A left external iliac node measures 14 x 22 (3:100).
A right subclavian infusion port ends in the mid SVC.
Since he has been in [**Hospital1 18**], he has received Methotrexate x 2 days and last [**Hospital1 **] level today was 0.13 and high dose dexamethasone  that has been tapered to 8mg Qday.

On POD 1, he remained stable after his procedure, continuing to make slow improvements.
He was restarted on his heparin drip, leucovorin and Vitamin A were added to his regimen per his oncology team.
He was dosed with stress dose steroids for the OR and this was weaned per protocol.
On POD 2, he was transfused one unit of PRBCs for a downward trending Hct to 24.
This was done in the setting of a device malfunction causing him to receive 22,000 units of Heparin in a bolus dose instead of the usual basal rate.
After identification of the problem, he was reversed with Protamine 50 mg and a head CT was performed to ensure no evidence of intracranial bleed -- it was negative.
Tube feeds through the J-tube were started at 10 cc/hr.
On POD 3, Mr. [**Known lastname 34578**] was on goal tube feeds, he was started on oxycodone and tylenol and his hydrocortisone taper was continued.
He was fluid resuscitated with several IVF boluses and his pressures were stabilized.
He was transferred back to the ICU for further care and started on pressors to maintain his [**Known lastname **] pressure.
A meeting was held with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the critical care team and the family.
He was maintained on pressors until he could be appropriately weaned with the decision to refrain from turning pressors back on should the need arise.
On POD 6, his pressor wean was continued and he was started on a morphine drip for comfort.
