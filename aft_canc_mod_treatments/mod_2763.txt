- Abdom U/S ([**1-17**]) showed nodular liver c/w cirrhosis; R & middle hepatic arteries w/elevated resistive indices; no flow in R or main portal veins that could be c/w portal vein thrombosis or infiltrative dz; R & middle hepatic veins WNL; L-side of liver & L-sided vasculature not visualized due to bowel gas & distention.
A large volume paracentesis was performed and 3.8 liters of fluid was removed with decreased in bladder pressure from 27 to 17.
Pt was started on octreotide & midodrine [**1-18**] for potential hepato-renal syndrome.
Pt was on levo/flagyl on floor; changed levoflox to Zosyn for gram neg coverage; continue vanco (started [**1-17**]); continued flagyl; also empirically started fluconazole [**1-17**].
Recommended continuing with current antibiotics (vanc by levels, zosyn, flagyl, fluconazole).
Per neuro, goal MAP>90 so was started on neo [**1-17**].
Carotid dopplers ([**1-18**]) notable for 60-69%R ICA occlusion and L-vertebral not visualized (so could be occulded or hypoplastic)  6) Coagulopathy: Likely from cirrhosis.
Reversed w/FFP for central line (fem) on [**1-17**] & [**1-19**].
