CXR ([**2171-2-13**]): In comparison with the study of [**2-12**], the tip of the endotracheal tube now lies approximately 4 cm above the carina.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 year old male with past medical history significant for marginal zone non Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p splenectomy [**2169-12-28**] and rituximab, rheumatoid arthritis on chronic prednisone, ?HIT, autoimmune hemolytic anemia transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further management of MRSA bacteremia.
MRI head significant for > 20 foci concerning for septic emboli to brain which might have caused his acute agitation leading to his intubation at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**].
Has been continued on IV Vancomycin throughout his hospital stay.
Cardiac surgery was consulted early but have decided not to intervene surgical due to multiple comorbidities along with septic emboli to his brain which would not be able to handle heparin load during open heart surgery.
CT abdomen/pelvis done on [**2171-2-13**] showed no intra-abdominal abscess, although study was limited without IV contrast.
Was started on zosyn on [**2-8**] for continued leukocytosis and fever; these initially improved but have remained elevated.
His respiratory status did improve over the course of his stay, however he remained intubated due to sedation and poor neurologic exam.
Acute kidney injury: pt has chronic kidney disease, with baseline creatinine around 1.5.
Heme consulted, who felt that this was likely not HIT, but recommended no heparin x24 hours.
