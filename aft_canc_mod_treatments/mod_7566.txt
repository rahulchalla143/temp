She eventually required 100% NRB, and then non-invasive ventilation with PEEP and 100% FiO2 in order to maintain oxygenation.
Her labs and ABGs suggested respiratory fatigue and systemic ischemia (rising lactate; antibiotics were started in case this represented sepsis).
A family meeting was held with the patient and her family; she had a significant risk of mortality from CPR and intubation, and might possibly never be able to be weaned from a ventilator in the setting of her bad emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension.
Patient and family decided to decline intubation and her management was shifted towards comfort-focused care.
