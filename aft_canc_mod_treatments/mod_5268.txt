Slightly echogenic appearance of liver, borderline by ultrasound, but consistent with mild fatty infiltration present on the recent CT. 2.
--Bone marrow aspirate and core biopsy: Markedly hypercellular myeloid-dominant bone marrow with trilineage dysmyelopoiesis and ringed sideroblasts, consistent with a myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic syndrome (overlap syndrome).
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 58 year-old gentleman who was admitted from clinic for further management of leukocytosis of 80,000 of unclear etiology.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS Etiology of leukocytosis was multifactorial, including steroid use, possible infection, and underlying myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorder, with the latter diagnosis predominating: - INFECTIOUS: Patient with recent R thigh carbuncle/abscess that was drained and debrided at outside hospital, then grafted.
Patient was started on empiric Vanc/Zosyn for pseudomonal and MRSA coverage.
ID was consulted for work-up and management of fever/wound.
After adequate debridement and strict dressing care, wound appeared to be healing well and antibiotics were discontinued on [**2148-6-21**].
Patient subsequently developed fever, and antibiotics were added back to regimen for 2-3 days.
Given clinical improvement and no other localizing sources of infection, antibiotics were once again tapered.
Patient developed low grade fever thereafter, and it was felt that fever was due to cytokine release from lysis of cells secondary to chemotherapy (see below) and not infection.
Given concerns for leukostasis from marked leukocytosis, patient started on hydroxyurea and prophylactic allopurinol was added to regimen.
Patient had 2 hypoxic episodes, with desaturations to 85% on room air, and 4 liter oxygen requirement.
Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management given concerns of respiratory demise from leukostasis.
Patient was started on 7-day therapy of low-dose Ara-C continuous infusion, and tolerated chemotherapy well.
After short stay in ICU, patient was transferred back to [**Hospital Unit Name 3242**] floor on nasal cannula.
Patient's symptoms improved with diuresis and was weaned off supplemental oxygen relatively rapidly.
Patient received supportive platelet/RBC transfusions as needed.
Patient tolerated chemotherapy, and leukocytosis responded well.
Patient to continue Hydroxyurea and Allopurinol as outpatient, and will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] for further management of MDS/MPS.
Bone Marrow Transplant and XRT to spleen are two options that are being considered.
- DERMATOLOGIC/STEROIDS: Patient had received 8 days of prednisone 60mg prior to admission for treatment of macular skin rash.
Rash responded well to oral steroids.
On admission, steroids were discontinued.
Topical steroids were recommended as needed, but rash did not worsen and patient was not symptomatic from it.
Oral steroids were later added back to regimen as adjunctive treatment of underlying myelodysplastic disorder.
Patient improved with PPI [**Hospital1 **], unclear whether this was coincidental, as leukocytosis was brought under control concurrently.
Patient was continued on PPI [**Hospital1 **] as outpatient.
Patient was started on Metoprolol TID for rate control and diuresed with standing (and then PRN, Lasix).
