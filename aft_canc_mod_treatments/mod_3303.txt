Cultures were sent and he was started on empiric cefepime.
No further blood cultures were positive, and his antibiotics were eventually narrowed to ceftriaxone alone for a 14 day course, starting at the resolution of neutropenia.
He was started on oral lidocaine and gelclairm as well as oral fluconazole and nystatin for [**Female First Name (un) 564**].
He was later taken off the fluconazole as it elevated his transaminases and changed to micafungin.
IV morphine was used for pain control and he briefly required a PCA pump.
However, the resultant increase in secretions caused respiratory distress and hypoxia, requiring ICU transfer for frequent deep suctioning and nebulizers.
Acute renal failure: Despite normal creatinine at 1.0, this essentially doubled from low baseline of 0.4-0.7 and BUN/creatinine 36.
He was agressively hydrated with IVF and creatinine improved.
He was started on filgrastim and eventually his ANC completely recovered.
He was started on enoxaparin.
He required 2 units RBCs for this, but endoscopy could not be done due to his neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.
Later on, in the setting of starting enoxaparin for DVT, he had dark guaiac positive stools.
GI was consulted and felt bleeding was related to mucositis vs colitis/inflammation in setting of anticoagulation and did not feel there was indication for scope as an inpatient.
He received no further treatments as an inpatient, and he will follow up with his oncologist as an outpatient.
Nutrition: Due to poor POs, PPN was started as there was not enough access for TPN in the patient's chest port due to antibiotics and IV fluids.
Once his antibiotics were weaned, TPN was initiated via his port.
He also had an elevated INR that was likely nutritional, and improved with vitamin K.
