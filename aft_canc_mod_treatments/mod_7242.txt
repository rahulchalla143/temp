Bowel loops, distal ureters, and Foley containing bladder are unremarkable.
Chest Pain:  The patient was admitted to internal medicine.
The patient was transferred to the CCU, and was placed on Hydrocortisone 50mg IV Q6h, with rising BP to the 110-140 SBP range off Levophed.
Hydrocortisone was converted to Prednisone 60mg PO QD on discharge.
The patient had been taking large doses of Tizanidine prior to arrival for unclear reasons.
Leg weakness:  The patient's primary complaint on admission was his leg weakness, which has been going on since his foot surgery in [**2127-7-2**].
Neurology was consulted, and concluded that the weakness was likely multifactorial, at least partially due to a steroid myopathy.
In the future, it would likely be beneficial if the patient could titrate back his steroid requirements, but in the context of his lung disease this may not be possible.
The procedure has been rescheduled for [**2127-10-22**], and the patient was instructed not to take his Plavix or Aspirin 325 for 5 days prior to the procedure.
He was instead placed on ASA 81mg during the interim to prevent in-stent restenosis.
If the patient continues to maintain good BPs as his steroids are tapered down, then Lisinopril 10mg PO QD, Metoprolol 50mg PO BID, and Lasix 40mg PO BID can be added back as tolerated.
He received a large amount of fluids with his period of hypotension, but actually tolerated it surprisingly well.
Dilantin was held and the level was followed down.
Dilantin was restarted at 200mg PO TID, and should be titrated as needed to maintain therapeutic dose range.
Gout: allopurinol was continued throughout the hospitalization with no changes made on discharge.
