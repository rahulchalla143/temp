Admission Date:  [**2175-8-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2175-9-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2141-7-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Fentanyl / Flagyl / Cefepime / Valium / Morphine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**] Chief Complaint: fevers, night sweats, increasing abdominal girth  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Selective splenic artery embolization   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 34 yo [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] with an uncomplicated PMH who is transferred from OSH on [**8-20**] for massive splenomegally and suspicion of splenic hemorrhage in the setting of pancytopenia.
He sought evaluation from his primary care physician and was found on routine blood work to be pancytopenic.
He appears to have been transfused 2 units of p RBC and 2 units of FFP.
He underwent a 7 day course of cladribine from [**8-21**] to [**8-28**] which he tolerated well.
His splenomegaly was felt to be caused by his leukemia, and his spleen was not removed at that time per the surgery service, as it was felt to be so large it would have been a difficult operation, and it was felt his spleen would shrink from the chemo.
However, it was clear that his spleen had ruptured with resultant hemoperitoneum, and on [**8-24**], he underwent a selective splenic artery embolization in Interventional Radiology.
He tolerated the procedure well although had some post-procedure pain which was controlled with a Dilaudid PCA.
He developed a blackish lesion below his nostrils which was positive for HSV, and so he was treated with a 7-day course of acyclovir.
He was placed on a number of different courses of antibiotics while he was here, including vancomycin (which he had due to an erythematous PICC site - PICC was later pulled, cx tip was neg), cefepime (for neutropenic fevers), and flagyl (he developed an erythematous macular eruption over his entire torso after one dose of flagyl, which was immediately discontinued).
It was also felt that his fevers could have been due to either his disease or his chemo, and so he was given Prednisone 20 mg po bid.
This controlled his fevers, and his antibiotics were discontinued and he was sent home on Prednisone.
Neuro:  The night of [**8-28**], his PCA was switched from Dilaudid to Fentanyl and he became delirious.
He had an abdominal and head CT at that time (given his massively splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia) which ruled out bleeds in his abdominen and head.
Initially it was more cholestatic-appearing, with an elevated direct and indirect bilirubin (his bilirubin peaked at 23.)
He had hepatitis serologies that were negative except for Hepatitis B surface antibody.
Pulmonary:  He required O2 by nasal cannula initially, with no evidence on pneumonia on CXR.
This was felt to be due to atelectasis [**1-2**] his massive splenomegaly, and eventually resolved with incentive spirometry.
