Admission Date:  [**2131-6-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-6-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2051-12-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**] Chief Complaint: Biliary obstruction  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP with sphincterotomy and replacement of biliary stent  History of Present Illness: This is a 80 year old man with past medical history significant for biliary obstruction likely secondary to cholangiocarcinoma status post biliary stent in [**3-5**] who was transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] hospital where he presented with weakness and jaundice.
Patient underwent CT and MRCP at [**Hospital1 1474**], prior to transfer, which showed massive dilation of the intrahepatics, stent in the common bile duct, and gallstones in the gallbladder.
Stent removal and cholangiogram were attempted but failed.
Patient was thus transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for continued care and repeat attempt for stent removal and replacement.
ROS: Pt states that prior to his procedure he felt weak and had not eating in 2 days.
He denies abdominal pain, fevers, chills, N/V, dysuria, cough/SOB, chest pain.
TIA 3. detached retina 4. hypercholesterolemia 5. history of biliary obstruction s/p plastic stent [**3-5**] at [**Hospital 6451**] Hospital - brushings concerning for adenocarcinoma, CA [**43**]-9 normal (10) in [**3-5**],  CEA elevated (11) in [**3-5**], CT revealed portohepatic and gallbladder masses in [**3-5**]; patient being followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 66200**] of gastroenterology at [**Hospital1 1474**] 6. hypercholesterolemia  Social History: former machinist, no ETOH for a few years, retired, lives alone,  multiple pets.
HCP is [**Name2 (NI) 802**] [**Name (NI) 717**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 66201**]   Family History: 1. brother-lung cancer 2. brother-CAD 3. sister- cancer, one with breast cancer   Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 93.0 P:70s R:16 BP:90s/50s SaO2: 98% on NRB General: Somnalent but arousable.
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep using a free-hand technique.
The procedure was not difficult.
Procedures: A plastic stent was removed for the bile duct using a rat tooth forceps.
Given the malignant biliary obstruction (and need for metal stenting) a sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Following sphincterotomy fresh bleeding was noted.
Given the presnce of acute sphincterotomy bleed the plan for metal stenting was aborted due to poor duodenal visualisation and a 5cm by 10F double pig tail biliary stent was placed successfully in the common bile duct.
Following double pigtail stent placement 2 x 2cc 1/10,000 adrenaline injection was applied to the apex of the sphincterotomy.
Cytology samples were obtained for histology using a brush in the middle third of the common bile duct.
Impression: Papilla major diverticulum Stent in the major papilla Stent removal Malignant appearing mid-CBD stricture Cytology Sphincterotomy Double pigtail stent placement Hemostasis with 1/10,000 adrenaline, .
Check Hct now and again in 6 hours Await cytology and plan for metal stent placement in 1 month   Brief Hospital Course: 80 year old male with suspected cholangiocarcinoma transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for obstructive jaundice for stent change.
Bili and alk phos elevated from baseline with associated elevation of his LFTs.
Attempt was made to place a metal stent but due to bleeding following a small sphincterotomy to facilitate the stent placement, visualization was impaired and operators were forced to place a plastic stent.
Patient will be contact[**Name (NI) **] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to arrange placement of a metal stent for improved long term management within 1 month.
On the day of discharge, patient's bili and LFTs trending down.
Given patient had received 4 mg versed and 150 mcg of fentanyl prior to his procedure, he was given flumazenil 200mg times 2 and narcan 0.2 mg with sats coming up to mid 80s, but the patient remained unresponsive.
He was administered another 0.4 mg narcan which resulted in increased O2 sat to low 90s and increased level of consciousness.
The patient was given 1L NS bolus and 3 g of amp/sulbactam for SIRS and suspected cholangitis.
## Hypoxia: Patient's hypoxia following ERCP likely due to medications causing respiratory depression.
CXR showed stable bilateral pleural effusions and following narcan and flumazenil, the patient's respiratory rate improved and he was quickly weaned to room air.
## Hypotension: Likewise, likely related to medications +/- hypovolemia.
Patient was empirically covered with amp/sulbactam x 1 dose but lactate returned 1.6, cultures remain negative, and patient continues to do well off antibiotics.
He did receive a liter of NS for resuscitation but remained stable thereafter without further boluses.
## Acute blood loss anemia: Following sphincterotomy, patient had significant bleeding requiring epinephrine injection.
He was discharged on supplemental iron and warned of potential constipation and GI upset with this medication.
## Prophylaxis: pneumoboots and bowel regimen.
## FEN: Initially kept NPO given above.
