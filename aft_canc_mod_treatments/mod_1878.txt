= = = = = = ================================================================  Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 y/o lady with h/o NSCLC (large cell with neuroendocrine features) with liver involvement and carcinoid syndrome, who presented with diarrhea, flushing, palpitations, vomiting and lethargy in the setting of infection as well as carcinoid syndrome due to not injecting Octreotide at home.
Her course was complicated by one episode of seizure for which she was started on Keppra.
She was discharged to rehab with plans for long-acting Octreotide injections in the future.
She was started on octreotide 200mg sc q 4 hrs with close f/u of symptoms.
She is being discharged to rehab on Octreotide SC TID, but she will follow up in [**Hospital **] clinic to have monthly Sandostatin (long-acting Octreotide), to ensure compliance.
Diarrhea: C. diff colitis in addition to carcinoid syndrome.
Given her PPI use as well as recent antibiotic use, she is predisposed to getting C. diff infection.
She was started on  PO Vancomycin and her stools became more formed.
She will complete a 2 week course of this antibiotic; the last day of treatment [**2199-1-15**].
On the third day of admission, the patient complained of chest pain (see below) and she received Morphine & Ativan.
She was transfered to the ICU on [**2199-1-4**] for elective intubation for airway protection and further work-up.
Patient loaded with keppra and started on keppra 750mg IV BID for seizure prophylaxis.
She did have an elevation in WBC; concern for meningitis prompted antibiotic coverage with empiric vancomycin, cefepime, ampicillin, and acyclovir for empiric meningitis coverage.
LP without sign of infection; the empiric antibiotics were discontinued.
This resolved with IV fluid and at the time of discharge her creatinine was 0.6.
This was most likely due to disease progression, meds and dehydration.
-IV Access: left upper extremity PICC line placed [**2199-1-3**].
