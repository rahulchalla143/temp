She received a total of six cycles of chemotherapy with [**Hospital1 **] (3 cycles) and CHOP (3 cycles).
Her chemotherapy course was complicated by admissions for fevers due to bacteremia, line associated DVT, and bilateral  pulmonary emboli requiring anticoagulation.
She completed her 6th chemotherapy course in [**7-/2127**] and continued to  be seen for follow-up.
- [**2127-5-15**], TEE demonstrated a tricuspid mass, and she was treated with antibiotics as well as Lovenox for question of septic emboli.
At that time, she also underwent a lower extremity ultrasound without evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
- [**2127-6-6**], noted to have a left-sided brachial vein deep vein  thrombosis and at that time, was switched from Lovenox to fondaparinux out of concern that she developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
Her postpartum course was complicated by fevers, pelvic fluid collection, and an upper GI bleed due to gastric involvement of her lymphoma which initially delayed her chemotherapy.

She also has a large clot burden in her upper extremities which makes PICC placement difficult.
She was on IV heparin in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] but this was transitioned to SC heparin TID for concern of hemorrhagic conversion.
She was resumed on heparin gtt and then again switched to Lovenox (adjusted by weight) after port placement ([**2129-5-17**]).
