She underwent a craniotomy  for evacuation of the hemorrhage and R temporal lobectomy.
She had been on prophylactic Dilantin and initially Keppra was added to her regimen for seizure control.
Because of side effects, this was changed to Dilantin and Depakote.
After a prolonged hospitalization and rehabilation, she was eventually discharged to home on [**2112-3-11**] where she was living independently for several weeks with daily assistance from her daughter who lives nearby.
Her dilantin level was toxic at 23.9 and this medication was then discontinued.
in Mid [**Month (only) 547**] while at rehab noticed that her left arm, face and leg were shaking.
This persisted during the ambulance ride to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1459**] Hospital and was not stopped until 1mg of ativan was administered somewhere around 30minutes after symptoms began.
It was discovered that her dilantin had been discontinued prior to her recent discharge from the neurosurgery service and on admission her dilantin level was subtherapeutic at 7.2 and her depakote was also subtherapeutic at 28.
Because of her recent falls, it was decided that dilantin might be contributing to her instability, so this medication was not restarted.
She was instead loaded with IV keppra and then started on oral maintenance keppra.
She was given an extra dose of depakote during the hospital and the level at discharge was therapeutic at 57.
Her UTI was treated with ceftriaxone.
She was evaluated by PT and OT who recommended rehab for further treatment of her gait and balance difficulties.
At discharge, her neurological exam was remarkable for some tangential thinking and mild gait instability requiring a walker.
However, on review of her current meds she seems to be off of keppra and on scheduled Chlorpromazine.
