On seizure detection files, there were between 30 and 40 electrographic seizures consisting of generalized theta frequency spike and slow wave discharges intermixed with periods of faster monomorphic sharp waves with a beta frequency.
The previously noted PICC line appears to have been replaced by another, its tip lying at the junction of the SVC and right atrium.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2111-10-14**] 11:02 PM IMPRESSION: Status post left parietooccipital craniotomy with persistent small hyperdense focus at the margin of the resection bed, which may represent residual tumor as suggested previously.
OUTSIDE FILMS READ ONLY Study Date of [**2111-10-14**] 11:02 PM IMPRESSION: Status post left parietooccipital craniotomy with persistent small hyperdense focus at the margin of the resection bed, which may represent residual tumor as suggested previously.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 84 yom with PMHx of CAD, CHF, adenocarcinoma of the brain s/p resection in [**7-7**] and DVT/PE admitted to the MICU with new onset tonic clonic seizure and initial persistent unresponsiveness.
The patient was placed on BiPAP (DNR/DNI) and loaded on Dilantin at OSH.
In the setting of new onset seizure, initial differential included post-ictal state, metabolic process, CVA and underlying infection.
LP was therefore deferred for concern of increased ICP and empiric antibiotics (ceftriaxone and acyclovir) were started to cover for meningitis.
The patient was initially placed on BiPAP for recorded O2 desaturations.
Serial ABG's were initially performed showing improving respiratory status and BiPAP was discontinued within the first several hours of admission.
EEG was performed on [**10-16**] which was concerning for underlying seizure activity and Neurology recommended continuing Dilantin and adding Keppra for improved seizure control.
However, given family wishes and patient's continous state of sedation, anti-seizure medications were peeled back.
Neurotin was stopped and then the dilantin was stopped.
He was maintained on keppra till discharge.
#  Sepsis: Patient was initially hypotensive to high 80's systolic on arrival to ICU which responded to fluid boluses.
Patient also had numerous open skin sores and thus osteomyellitis and bactermia were also considered.
Given respirator status, congested lung sounds on physical exam and serial CXR's pneumonia was also strongly considered.
Patient was initially broadly covered with ceftriaxone, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin.
On [**10-17**], antibiotics were tailored as suspicion for meningitis was very low considering his rapid clinical improvement and physical exam findings.
Patient was started on Unasyn for possible pneumonia / aspiration and vancomycin for possible MRSA.
His antibiotics were broaden to zosyn and vancomycin.
He remained afebrile and was maintained on these medications until discharge.
He was discharged on vancomycin IV and augmentin PO for two additional days.
He is not on meds that are associated with lowering sz threshold.
# Respiratory Acidosis: patient initially presented with respiratory acidosis and reported desaturations on Bi-PAP.
Serial ABG's showed improving respiratory status amd Bi-PAP was discontinued after several hours on the floor.
# PAF: amiodarone was held as rate was AV paced without any signs of atrial fibrillation and initial hypotension.
# Cardiomyopathy: Carvedilol and furosemide was initially held for concern of sepsis.
On [**10-17**] Lasix was restarted given his CXR, congested lung sounds and fluid overload.
