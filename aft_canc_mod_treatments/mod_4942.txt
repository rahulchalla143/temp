However, given the patient's poor respiratory and functional status, surgery was not recommended.
She was discharged on hospice with focus on comfort measures.
This progressed to the point where she couldn't eat or drink anything without aspirating and going into respiratory distress with hypoxia requiring a face mask.
She was then kept NPO and was evaluated for causes of dysphagia.
Given her prognosis, the family and patient decided not to pursue other means of nutrition such as a PEG tube or TPN.
It was felt that her use of lovenox as an outpatient likely contributed to a slow GI bleed.
Cardiology was consulted to assess the risk of EGD under general anesthesia as she had a troponin of 0.17 on admission with an echo that showed subtle hypokinesis of mid-inferolateral wall but no significant wall motion abnormality.
Cardiology initially felt that she could complete EGD/colonoscopy without further cardiology testing and should start a beta blocker for BP control.
