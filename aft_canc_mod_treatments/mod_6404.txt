Admission Date:  [**2155-6-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2155-6-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-11-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**] Chief Complaint: mental status changes/hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: continuous renal replacement therapy  History of Present Illness: 56-year-old male who was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma transitioning to a marginal zone lymphoma in [**1-/2154**] who is admitted from the ED with mental status changes.
He subsequently had a tracheostomy and was weaned to a trach mask which coincided with improvement in his mental status.
He was initiated on levophed and had a prolonged course due to persistent hypotension.
He was also on vasopressin for a period of time.
His pressors were weaned down and his pressor requirement and perfusion was determined based on mental status.
He was placed on midodrine and florinef for orthostasis and autonomic dysfunction which was thought to be a result of deconditioning.
He also had a persistent leukocytosis with intermittent fevers.
He was subsequently started on broad spectrum antibiotics including Ceftaz, vanc, flagyl and levaquin.
His CVVH catheter tip did grow pseudomonas as well; however, he did not have any positive blood cultures.
His improved but persistent leukocytosis was thought to be in part a result of autosplenectomy that occurred during the previous admission.
He was started on defibrotide protocol for his VOD; however, this was discontinued after an MRI demonstrated an unexpected subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Per his wife, he in fact was able to tolerate 0.5L of fluid removal on this past Saturday.
He was taken to [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital where a 2.5 L paracentesis was performed with a SAAG <1.1.
He apparently had his HD catheter dislodged and required replacement tunneled line placement as well.
He received stress dose steroids there as well and had a low grade temperature of 99.
He was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management.
Patient was given...He was apparently minimally responsive, with eyes open, but not aware of his surroundings and not talking.
His wife is clear that she does not want aggressive resuscitation, and after discussion with the patient, he is adamant that he would not want to be put back on the ventilator.
There was no expression of CD-23 or cyclin D1.
He received R-CVP x 3 cycles (vincristine discontinued 2.2 neuropathy), then continued on 2 additional cycles of RCVP;  neupogen after each cycle of chemotherapy; then 4 cycles of R-Bendamustine; susbequently had mobilization HiDAC [**1-8**] followed by stem cell harvesting and transplant -Right thigh lymphedema (significantly improved, per patient) -RLE DVT from compression (was on coumadin until [**2154-11-25**]) -Mild diverticulitis -s/p vasectomy, tonsillectomy  Social History: Currently living at LTAC.

Only the sub-costal window was available.
ET tube and a nasogastric feeding tube are in standard placements and a right PIC line ends in the SVC.
He was placed on continuous renal replacement therapy, although it was difficult to remove fluid given his tenuous hemodynamics, and he required vasopressors to maintain an adequate blood pressure.
His pressors were also changed to reduce beta-adrenergic stimulation.
The patient clearly stated that he did not want to remain on hemodialysis, and that he did not want to be placed on the mechanical ventilator again.
His pressors were turned off on [**6-22**], and the patient's care was transitioned towards comfort.
