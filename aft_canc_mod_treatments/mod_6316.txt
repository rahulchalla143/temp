Admission Date:  [**2144-9-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-12-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-7-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: A fib with RVR  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right side thoracoscentesis on [**2144-10-28**]  History of Present Illness: 59yF with h/o mental retardation,  Nodular sclerosing Hodgkins Lymphoma s/p chemo, refractory paroxysmal a.fib w/RVR, ileus, pericardial effusion requiring window and pleural effusions, who p/w Afib w/ RVR after being discharged on [**2144-9-18**] to rehab following hospitalization for tachypnea and increased O2 requirement.
This past hospitalization was complicated by refractory afib with RVR requiring amiodarone ggt for conversion, GNR bacteremia with ecoli, enterobacter, and two species of klebsiella, recurring ileus necessitating rectal tube decompression, herpes simplex ulceration of the mouth and hypercarbia and somnolence requiring intubation.
On readmission, she was given a bolus of 150mg IV amiodarone given with minimal response (rate in 120s, SBP 90).
Cardology was consulted, and recommended IVF (given 1300cc) and beta blockade once pressure had  stablized.
She was given Cipro and fluconazole in the ED, and then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring and further management of low BP and Afib/RVR.
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2144-6-22**] for evaluation of abdomenal distention in the setting of recent dx of pericardial effusion and iron def anemia.
She was discharged on [**2144-7-7**] with instructions to see her PCP within [**Name Initial (PRE) **] week for excisional LN biopsy.
Thoracentesis was attempted, but unsuccessful.
Her labs at that time showed WBC 12.6 with 98% PMN and 2% Ly, Hb 8.3, HCT 28.1, PLT 472K, ESR 107 and Albumin 3.0.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was started on a modified EACoPP protocol on [**2144-7-21**] with cytoxan, doxorubicin on day 1 and etoposide days [**2-13**].
On [**2144-7-23**] she was started on amiodarone and metoprolol and was eventually rate and rhythm controlled.
She was intubated for 3 days and extubated one day prior to transfer to BMT.
An echo was obtained which showed RV and RA collapse w tamponade physiology.
She tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
Approximately 150 cc of clear fluid was removed and sent for cytology.
Following the operation she was brought to the CVICU for monitoring.
She was maintained on Amiodarone and beta blockade for intermittent atrial fibrillation.
TPN was continued for her chronic ileus.
Her mediastinal chest tube was eventually removed on [**2144-8-31**].

She received an Amiodarone drip and was brought under control before returning to the floor, having returned to sinus rhythm and on amiodarone and metoprolol.
She was not hemodynamically unstable, but her atrial fibrillation was quite difficult to control and her rate didn't decrease despite multiple doses of IV metoprolol.
At that time the treating team was unwilling to give IV calcium channel blockers as the patient had experienced profound hypotension when treated with them in the past.
Thus, she was transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] again briefly to receive another IV amiodarone load, after which she once again returned to the floor on increased metoprolol dosing and an oral amiodarone load schedule.
After her return to the floor she continued to have long periods of atrial fibrillation of up to 7 hours at a time that was not responsive to IV beta blockers by push.
Finally, after maximizing her dose of beta blocker the patient was started on oral calcium channel blockers and remained in sinus rhythm thereafter.
Patient was transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory distress that required intubation (please see [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] #2, below).
She continued PO amiodarone, however metoprolol and calcium channel blocker were held.
After extubation for improved respiratory status, patient was restarted on her low dose metoprolol with hold parameters for heart rate and blood pressure.
Thereafter, on PO metoprolol, diltiazem, and amiodarone she remained in NSR with stable hemodynamic parameters.
Given her stability, however, the decision was made to continue with [**Hospital1 **] dosing of amiodarone during her hospital stay.
She also had a new left upper lobe infiltrate at this time and thus was initially started on cefepime, vanco for empiric treatment of neutropenic fever.
Her B-glucan and galactomannan assays were negative.
Coverage was discontinued after 10 days of no longer being neutropenic.
With concerns for possible septic picture patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage.
Her fevers resolved, and her antibiotics were discontinued when she was no longer neutropenic.
#Hypoxia: Patient had onset of hypoxia needing 2-4L of O2 by nasal cannula in order to maintain sats >92% during her second ICU stay.
As her hypoxia resolved with treatment of her probable pneumonia and was resolved by the time her thrombocytopenia resolved we did not pursue thoracentesis further.
Initial extubation failed, placed again on vent.
Secondary extubation successful with pretreatment with IV steroids.
Thereafter, diuresis was stopped and volume status remained stable.
The interventional pulmonology team advised that no intervention be performed given the stability of the finding.
Repeat echocardiograms in this hospitalization continued to show a small, hemodynamically insignificant pericardial effusion.
During this hospitalization the patient nadired from her first cycle of ICE and completed her second cycle.
Pt is s/p EACoPP protocol on [**2144-7-21**] with cytoxan, doxorubacin on day 1 and etoposide on days [**2-13**].
Pt has also had pericardial tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis on [**2144-6-24**] and pericardial window on [**2143-7-25**] as above.
She was given transfusions as needed.
Twenty sessions of XRT to mediastinal mass was administered without complications.
PO vancomycin was continued.
The infectious disease consulting service advised that this medication be tapered and eventually as an outpatient after her course of Bactrim had been completed in order to avoid the development of resistant organisms.
# Urinary tract infection:  The patient had an indwelling catheter throughout her stay.
A 5-day course of Bactrim was recommended by the consulting infectious disease course, to be completed at her rehab facility.
# Speech and swallow:  Because aspiration was thought to have contributed to her respiratory distress, she was initially given tube feeds after extubation.
# Access:  The patient had multiple PICCs and peripheral IVs placed for access, which she repeatedly pulled out.
A PICC was placed prior to discharge.
The patient was maintained on mechanical ventilation and assessed daily for ability to extubate and her sedation was weaned as tolerated.
Concern for sepsis arose and she was given IV fluids and levophed for BP control.
She was pan-cultured and broad spectrum antibiotics were continued.
Less than 12 hours later she was taken off pressors and remained hemodynamically stable.
She was maintained on her prophylactic antibiotics and broad coverage while her cultures were pending.
She became neutropenic during this admission, which fell in line with her chemotherapy nadir.
She was continued on antibiotics during this time while her counts rose.
She was continued on amiodarone throughout her stay and kept on telemetry.
She was retarted on metoprolol PO once her blood pressure could tolerate.
Patient was initially on shovel mask and face mask and with thoracentesis, agressive chest PT was able to be transitioned back to 2L NC which was her baseline on previous [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] discharge.
Cardiology reccomended maximizing current medications which include amiodarone and diltiazem prior to initiating another [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
As patient has completed more than necessary course of antibiotics and no longer neutropenic, d/c Vanco, Cefepime, caspofungin.
Patient got additional dose of neulasta in order to ensure that pt not neutropenic.
