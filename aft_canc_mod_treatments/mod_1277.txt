He has felt unwell with fatigue and malaise since he underwent CT-scan last Monday.
He was given ASA and loaded with Plavix, code STEMI was called, and he was taken to the catheterization lab for intervention.
A bare metal stent was successfully deployed in each of the lesions; DES were deferred in the setting of the patient's metastatic cancer and potential bleeding risk on longterm anticoagulation.
The procedure was complicated by an episode of fluid responsive hypotension due to vagal stimulation.
He continued on a renally dosed integrilin gtt for 6 hours post cath and was started on medical management for acute coronary syndrome with ASA 325, plavix 75, metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], and atorvastatin 80.
Afterload reduction was deferred given his recent hypotension.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Treatment Hx: Status post left radical nephrectomy, [**2147-7-13**].
Successful PTCA and stenting of distal RCA subtotal occlusion with 2.0x18mm Mini Vision bare metal stent.
Successful direct stenting of proximal RCA lesion with 3.0x18mm Vision bare metal stent postdilated to 3.25mm.
Systemic hypotension during the case, that responded to intravenous fluid bolus.
He presented to the CCU s/p 2 BM stents to ostial and distal RCA stensoses and intra-catheterization vagally induced hypotension in the setting of acute kidney injury.
[**Last Name (un) **]: Pt found to have [**Last Name (un) **], which is likely multifactorial - due to pre-renal (FeNA<1%), post-renal, and intra-renal pathophysiology; responded well to an empiric fluid challenge and bladder scan was revealing of bladder outflow obstruction, prompting placement of a foley; UA showed casts concerning for contrast nephropathy after a heavy dye load recently (a CT for re-staging of his cancer) and catheterization.
Pt responded to fluid challenge.
Pt continued to decline despite aggressive resusitation.
