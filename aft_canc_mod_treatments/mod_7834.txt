# HYPOXIA: The patient arrived with dyspnea and O2 sat of 87% on room air.
He was placed on a non-rebreather in the ED, where he improved significantly, with O2 sat of 100%.
On ICU day 2, he underwent therapeutic R thoracentesis, yielding 1200 cc of yellow fluid.
He subsequently underwent placement of R Pleurex catheter, which he tolerated well.
On admission he presented with bilateral pulmonary edema, JVD, and orthopnea on exam; he had no lower extremity pitting edema.
He was diuresed with IV lasix as discussed above and transitioned to PO Torsemide 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Coumadin was held in the setting of the patient's Pleurex catheter placement and subsequently restarted at his home dose as detailed below.
# CKD STAGE IV: His creatinine rose from 2.2 upon admission to a peak of 2.4 as a result of aggressive diuresis.
# CAD: No changes were made to the patient's home doses of nifedipine, metoprolol and pravastatin.

In there, you required oxygen, medication through your vein (lasix or furosemide) to get rid of the fluid as well as a thoracocentesis (drainage of the fluid around your lung).
You also underwent the placement of the pleurex catheter in the right of your chest so we can drain the fluid in the future.
We had to stop your coumadin for the procedures you underwent.
Your medications were changed as follows: * We stopped the coumadin in the hosptial and recently re-started it.
You will need to have you INR drawn early next week (Tuesday or Wednesday) * We stopped your spironolactone given that your potassium was slightly high in the hospital.
If you develop worsening of your breathing, severe shortness of breath, decrease in your ability to move and do your daily activities call your doctor.
