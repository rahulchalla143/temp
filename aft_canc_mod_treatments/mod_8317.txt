She was treated for typical CAP with IV ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
Transitioned to PO levofloxacin on discharge for total 10 day course of antibiotics, was at baseline 2L NC on discharge wth O2 sat 96% .
She was treated with regular and PRN nebs, Prednisone for 5 days course and pneumonia was treated with IV Abx as above.
She was continued on duonebs and IV methylprednisolone, which was later transitioned to prednisone.
On medical floor, she was started on a prednisone taper which she will continue on discharge.
She had mild STE noted in V1 and V2 on EKG compared to prior studies.
She was treated with aspirin and a 48 hour heparin drip, and cardiac echo showed new wall motion abnormality in region of PDA.
Shortness of breath responded to IV diuresis, as evidenced by improving O2 requirement after lasix was given.
Cardiology was consulted, who recommended incresaing aspirin to 325 mg daily, starting high dose atorvastatin and beta blocker, and ACEI when renal function improved in order to treat ACS.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was resuscitated very quickly in the ED with CPAP, and the team felt it unlikely that a PE large enough to cause her to pass out would resolve so quickly with CPAP and a quick wean to oxygen via nasal cannula.
Importantly, she was treated with a 48 hour heparin drip and aspirin for her NSTEMI and kept on subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis afterward.
Initially improved, however after diuresis with lasix incresaed to 1.5.
