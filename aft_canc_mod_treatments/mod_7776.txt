Gastrojejunostomy tube placement   History of Present Illness: 59-year-old woman with ALL who is receiving chemotherapy.
She received approximately 9 liters of crystalloid and pressors to reestablish perfusion and urine output in the ER.
She was given antibiotics in consultation with the bone marrow transplant service who follows her (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6944**] attending).
After a discussion with the family, she was taken to the operating room for treatment of presumed dead bowel of unknown origin with progression to infarction and septic shock.
Past Medical History: Vancomycin SENSITIVE enterococcus faecium bacteremia from port during induction chemotherapy [**1-/2113**] PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**] [**2-/2113**] - not confirmed by culture Hypothyroidism Hypertension Seasonal allergies s/p hysterectomy s/p appendectomy .
OncHx: (From Prior Notes) ALL, Precursor B-phenotype (Induction with Hyper-CVAD [**2113-1-7**], Negative for [**Location (un) 5622**] Chromosome).
Diffuse pneumatosis along the ascending, transverse, and descending colon with dilatation of the ascending and transverse colon, mucosal wall thickening, lack of enhancement, mesenteric  and portal venous gas.
She was immediately intubated; Levophed was started for her hypotension, and sent to the operating room.
She underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy on day of admission [**2113-6-11**].
Colonic necrosis from the cecum to upper rectum without perforation was discovered and Total abdominal colectomy and damage control packing of the abdomen was performed.
On [**2113-6-14**] she was taken back to the operating room for unpacking of the abdomen, Abdominal washout, ileostomy, and Gastrojejunostomy.
On [**2113-6-30**] she returned to the operating room due to abdominal wound dehiscence, prolonged respiratory failure, need for vascular access, and abdominal fat necrosis.
She underwent exploratory laparotomy with incision and drainage and re closure of laparotomy incision, drainage of intraabdominal collection (most likely sterile fat necrosis), tracheostomy, and placement of right subclavian central venous catheter.
The patient's post-operative course was also complicated by the development of a gastrocutaneous fistula out of the wound bed, assumedly due to erosion of gastric wall by the G-J tube.
This was initially managed by NPO and frequent VAC changes.
She was treated with a 5-day course of IVIG as empiric treatment for [**Month/Day (4) 7816**]-[**Location (un) **].
She was also started on erythropoietin in consultation with the heme/onc service.
Her most recent chemistry panel [**8-11**]:                   Glucose UreaN  Creat Na K Cl HCO3 AnGap                      143*  12      0.2* 138 3.8 98 32 12 PULMONARY As noted above, she suffered from prolonged respiratory failure and required tracheostomy placement.
Her tracheostomy was removed and her incision site healed without complication.
She was started on tube feedings which she has tolerated and at approximately HD #55 she was started on an regular diet which she has tolerated quite well.
Her tube feeds have been cycled; she will need to be on calorie counts once at rehab with decrease in cycle tube feeds with the goal of eventually having her on a regular diet with supplements as her nutritional support.
MUSCULOSKELETAL: Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted and have recommended acute rehab stay given her lengthy and complicated hospital course.
HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY: On [**2113-7-24**] she underwent sternal aspirate by the Heme/Onc service which did NOT show evidence of leukemia: (CELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH MATURING TRILINEAGE HEMATOPOIESIS.
ID She did have a urinary tract infection on [**7-21**] and was treated with Zosyn for 7 days once the sensitivities were back.
