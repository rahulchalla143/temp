FINDINGS: A left-sided PICC catheter has an aberrant course with the tip extending into the azygos vein (2:19).
Numerous blebs at the right upper lobe are also stable.
Cholecystectomy clips are present in the gallbladder fossa.
The significance of this is difficult to evaluate in the absence of IV contrast, but may be due to the new lung consolidations.
Malpositioned PICC catheter with the tip extending into the azygos vein.
When clinically appropriate, further evaluation with ultrasound should be performed.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: 71M with hx of endocarditis on IV vanc, NSCLC, hepC, COPD, and hx of right axillary vein/IJ thrombosis, presenting from rehab facility with progressive hypoxia and acute on chronic renal failure.
