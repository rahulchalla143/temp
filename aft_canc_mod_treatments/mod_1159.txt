After heparin gtt, she went for cardiac cath on [**4-14**] PM and was found to have patent grafts and 3vd, though low flow to LIMA and RLE vessels, thus s/p stenting of right CIA and L subclavian.
Heparin was used prior to the cath, which was stopped at noon on [**4-15**]; she did well during the procedure, although post-procedure there was a groin hematoma and hematocrit drop requiring 2 units prbc's.

Patent bilateral basilic veins and right cephalic veins with diameters as noted.
Patent fem-fem graft 5.
Successful stenting of the right CIA with a 7.0 mm Genesis stent.
Successful stenting of the left subclavian artery with a 6.0 mm Genesis stent, post-dilated to 7.0 mm.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with history of cancer with cardiac catheterization and intracranial hemorrhage for further evaluation to rule out metastatic disease.
The largest lesion now measuring 5 x 3 cm demonstrating acute blood products is seen in the right occipital region with surrounding edema.
There is irregular rim enhancement seen following the administration of gadolinium which extends to subependymal enhancement of the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
Additionally, several rounded areas of enhancement and signal changes are seen in both cerebral hemispheres measuring 1-2 cm in size involving the frontal and parietal lobes consistent with mild surrounding edema.
A right subclavian central venous catheter remains unchanged in position.
Surgical clips project over the mediastinum.
The patient is again seen to be status post median sternotomy.
[**4-19**] CXR: Findings; compared to [**2145-4-18**], there is a new Dobbhoff tube with the tip projecting over the mid abdomen.
Left subclavian stent reidentified.
She was dilantin loaded and started on standing dilantin.
Code status was discussed with the patient and with her family, and she expressed wishes that she did not want to be on a ventillator to prolong her life.
She was maintained on BiPAP (NIPPV) in the ICU for several days; the family again mentioned that she should under no circumnstances be intubated.
On [**4-19**], her creatinine had improved, and she was weaned from BiPAP to facemask with 10L O2.
Because she had clinically improved, a feeding tube (Dobhoff) was placed and she was transferred to the stepdown unit for further management.
The numerous brain lesions could be treated with whole brain irradiation as one palliative measure.
She was given morphine for air hunger and for comfort, and other medications aimed at treating underlying processes were discontinued.
Medications on Admission: Hm meds include metoprolol, lisonpril, norvasc, asa 81, lipitor 80, HCTZ; Plavix added in house post stent.
