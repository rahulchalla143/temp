A D-dimer was elevated as well as troponin.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at home include atenolol, Seroquel, and Prozac.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature of 100.5, his heart rate was 92, his blood pressure was 122/81, his respiratory rate was 30 to 40, and he was saturating 100% on 3 liters nasal cannula.
In general, he was an obese male using his abdominal and accessory muscles for breathing.
Initial set of troponins with a creatine kinase of 184, troponin T of 1.05.
He was in acute respiratory distress on admission and was placed on noninvasive positive pressure  ventilation for a brief period of time.
His shortness of breath symptomatically improved, and he required 3 liters by nasal cannula when he was stable.
He was placed on a heparin drip for his pulmonary embolism as well as his deep venous thrombosis.
There was an increased risk for recurrent pulmonary emboli given the patient's deep venous thrombosis if the patient was to be taken off of his heparin drip for a bronchoscopy.
Therefore, a temporary inferior vena cava filter was placed by Interventional Radiology on [**2169-5-9**].
The patient's partial thromboplastin time goal for his pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis is between 60 and 80.
He will be started on Coumadin and continued on heparin drip status post bronchoscopy until his INR is above 2 for greater than 48 hours, overlapping with heparin.
He was given levofloxacin and Flagyl for a 7-day course.
He also received physical therapy and occupational therapy.
Carotid ultrasounds were also performed to look for an embolic source of his strokes and were negative for stenoses.
The patient was placed on a heparin drip, aspirin, beta blocker, and statin on admission.
His aspirin had to be held prior to bronchoscopy and was to be restarted after this procedure.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended medical management with a high-dose statin, aspirin, and beta blocker.
An ACE inhibitor should be added as an outpatient.
The patient was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37053**] where his beta blocker should be titrated up and an outpatient stress test will be considered.
HYPERGLYCEMIA ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on a diabetic/low-cholesterol diet.
His fingerstick blood glucoses were measured four times per day, and he was placed on an insulin sliding-scale.
Tylenol 325 mg to 650 mg by mouth or per rectum q.4-6h.
Albuterol and ipratropium inhaler 1 to 2 puffs q.2-4h.
Atorvastatin 80 mg by mouth once per day.
Lopressor 12.5 mg by mouth twice per day.
Morphine sulfate 1 mg intravenously q.4h.
Zofran 4 mg intravenously q.6h.
Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
Heparin drip per nomogram (with a goal partial thromboplastin time of 60 to 80).
Coumadin 5 mg by mouth at hour of sleep.
Insulin sliding-scale as directed four times per day.
Ipratropium bromide nebulizer 1 nebulizer inhaled q.2-4h.
Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
Phenergan 12.5 mg intravenously q.6h.
Senna one tablet by mouth twice per day as needed.
Ambien 5 mg by mouth at hour of sleep as needed.
Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
