Triplanar post-Gadolinium spin echo T1-weighted images and axial post-Gadolinium MP-RAGE of the head were obtained.
The mass measures approximately 2.7 x 2.7 x 3.1 cm in its traverse, AP, and craniocaudal dimensions.
[**2110-7-3**] MDCT-acquired contiguous axial images of the head were obtained without IV contrast.
The patient is status post right frontal craniotomy.
It is unclear whether the event was syncopal or seizure related, though the latter is thought to be more likely given his brain metastases.
He was started on anti-epileptic medications (initially dilantin, which was discontinued and keppra started in its place per neurologic consultation).
He then underwent craniotomy and resection of the same mass on [**6-25**].
He was started on mannitol and increased doses of dexamethasone.
He will complete a taper of the dexamethasone following discharge, and should be maintained on a dosage of 2mg twice daily following the taper.
Of note, the patient complains of intermittent headache, which is relieved with dilaudid.
He will pursue additional oncologic treatment near his home in [**Location (un) 5503**].
Hyponatremia: He developed hyponatremia following his brain resection.
He was treated with a hypertonic saline, fluid restriction, and lasix.
On discharge, his sodium had normalized to 135 on continued fluid restriction, salt tabs, and lasix.
He was encouraged to continue these measures at home and to have his sodium checked by his PCP.
Steroid-induced diabetes: The patient was kept on glyburide and SSI.
He was continued on HAART and bactrim prophylaxis for PCP.
He would like her to get as much support as possible in the home; we discussed some of the various services they offer including RN visits, personal care assistants, SW.  c) He mentioned to me that he has told his prior doctors here that [**Name5 (PTitle) **] is not interested in being intubated again or being on mechanical ventilation.
We did not specifically discuss intubation for planned procedures, but having a DNR/DNI code status does not prevent him from undergoing future intubation for planned procedures that could possibly benefit him clinically (such as bronchoscopy).
d) He seems to be doing a good amount of reflecting on his life; he shared about overcoming his very abusive childhood (mother actively abused him and at one point he was hospitalized because she gave him a soda can spiked with house cleaner; mother was abused by father and "she took it out on me because we had the same name"); he states that he was a "really bad person in his young days", did a lot of awful things.
