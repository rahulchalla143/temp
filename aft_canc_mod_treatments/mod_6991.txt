He was given furosemide 80 mg via NG tube and morphine 2 mg SL x1, to treat presumed CHF exacerbation, without significant improvement.
He was placed on a non-rebreather, and EMS was called to bring the patient to the ED.
The patient was intubated with etomidate and succinylcholine, and sedated with fentanyl/midazolam.
He was given vancomycin 1g and cefepime 2g for presumed HAP.
He was also given acetaminophen 650 mg PR x1.
BP was generally stable in the ED, with systolic BP readings between 95-125.
He is intubated and sedated, not requiring hemodynamic support with vasopressors.
Several conversations were held between the MICU and floor teams, and the patient's brother [**Name (NI) 382**] and nieces, identifying what the patient's wishes would be in regards to his goals of care.

[**10-16**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-10**] through [**10-14**]:  Worsening opacification at the base of the right hemithorax could be due to increasing moderate pleural effusion alone or pleural fluid in association with lower lobe consolidation, a finding that would most readily be explained by aspiration.
No endotracheal tube is seen below C7, the upper margin of this film and there is some tapering of the airway suggesting edema from a recent endotracheal tube.
[**10-17**] CXR: REASON FOR EXAM: Respiratory distress, status post flash pulmonary edema in setting of A-fib.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] y/o nonverbal male with afib, CAD, htn, and recent admission for cardiogenic/septic shock [**1-17**] multifocal pneumonia, discharged to rehab on [**10-11**], presenting with worsening respiratory distress leading to intubation in ED.
Spoke with patient's brother over the phone, who stated that he wishes for patient to be intubated and wanted everything done but does not want his brother to undergo CPR.
# Hypoxia/Respiratory distress: Pt was initially admitted to MICU for respiratory distress, intubated and quickly extubated.
After transfer to floor on antibiotics for multifocal pneumonia, he had an episode of respiratory distress with tachypnea and labored breathing, the family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and brother reported that he wanted pt transferred back to the MICU.
CXR most consistent with recurrent multifocal airspace disease or infection (Patient at high risk for aspiration of tube feeds).
He was treated with 5 days of vancomycin and cefepime and then continued for total of 9 days on vanco and cipro, therefore completing his course for pneumonia.
He was amiodarone loaded and continued on metoprolol.
He intermittently had RVR requiring IV metoprolol, and his PO dose was uptitrated.
After 4 days of amiodarone 450mg [**Hospital1 **], he was transitioned to 450mg daily.
He was maintained on metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **].
# Dementia/hx of CVA: During the MICU course, he was sometimes not responsive at all, other times tracking but usually not following commands or answering questions appropriately, even when [**Hospital1 595**]-speaking staff were talking to him.
Tube feeds were continued for nutrition.
Prior to discharge, Foley was draining clear yellow urine with adequate urine output.
