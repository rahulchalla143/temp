She is s/p chemotherapy (7 + 3 induction) Day +141.
She is being admitted for nonmyeloablative allogeneic double cord transplant with Fludarabine, Melphalan and ATG conditioning regimen.
ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.
ONCOLOGICAL HISTORY: From OMR admission note: Ms. [**Known lastname 20281**] is a 69-year-old woman with a past medical history significant for aortic valvular replacement for aortic stenosis in [**2143**] and venous occlusion of the retinal vein in [**10/2144**], who presented on [**2145-1-27**] to the [**Hospital 18**] [**Hospital 620**] campus with increasing fatigue and shortness of breath.
She was started on IV fluids with bicarbonate and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Because of her high white count, Ms. [**Known lastname 20281**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] leukophoresis and initially received hydroxyurea.
On [**2145-1-28**], she was initiated on 7 and 3 induction regimen with idarubicin and ara-C.
She also was noted for a drop in her ejection fraction to 20-25% on [**2145-2-14**], which was felt due to anthracycline use.
She has been managed medically initially with spironolactone, furosemide, lisinopril, and metoprolol and is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], NP as an outpatient.
Her lisinopril was discontinued due to cough which has since resolved.
She was followed by psychiatry while an inpatient and was discharged on [**2145-3-3**] to [**Hospital1 **] House Rehabilitation in order to improve her strength before moving forward with further therapy.
Her cardiomyopathy also limited her ability to receive further chemotherapy.
She had noted a superficial saphenous vein clot and was started on Lovenox approximately two weeks prior to this.
However, she was found to have a positive HIT antibody and was admitted for initiation of Argatroban therapy on [**2145-3-22**].
Followup testing with serotonin releasing assay was negative, thereby making HIT diagnosis unlikely.
Over the past 4 - 6 weeks, Ms. [**Known lastname 20281**] has received periodic transfusion support but her counts have slowly recovered.
She had a repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on [**2145-4-23**] which showed a hypocellular erythroid dominant bone marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis whit no evidence for acute leukemia.
Because of her known mutations, she is at high risk for recurrent leukemia and is in need of n allogeneic transplant.
She is being admitted today for her nonmyeloablative allogeneic double cord transplant with Fludarabine, Melphalan and ATG conditioning regimen.
2: Aortic valve replacement in [**4-/2143**] secondary to aortic stenosis.
History of hepatic cyst (noted on a preoperative workup for AVR and stable on imaging) - was concerning for an echinococcal cyst, and treated empirically with albendazole in [**10/2143**]; repeat CT from [**2145-2-16**] notes the cyst to be markedly smaller at 10.6 x 10.1 mm from 8.5 x 6.2 cm.
Left retinal vein occlusion [**10/2144**] thought to be in setting of leukocytosis [**2-22**] AML 10.
Typhilitis during induction chemotherapy   Social History: Married, lives with her husband in [**Name (NI) 620**], originally from [**Name (NI) **], has 4 children, some live locally.

A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally.
Aortic valve bioprosthesis without obvious vegetations.
This is a 69 year old woman with AML, s/p 7+3, day 15 of non-myeloablative allogeneic double cord transplant, with PMH of bioprosthetic aortic valve, now in the ICU with worsening mental status, increasing oxygen needs, and evident fluid overload in the setting of acute renal failure and likely chronic heart failure as well as recent VRE bacteremia.
She was given high-dose Lasix followed by Lasix drip with minimal urine output.
O2 requirement continued to increase, and she was intubated.
Possibly secondary to prior chemotherapy.
Milrinone gtt was started with standing metoprolol to decrease heart rate.
SvO2s  improved and milrinone was weaned.
However, on day of expiration EF was reduced to less 10% and she appeared to have cardiogenic shock.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: The patient developed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 140s, compromising her forward flow and resulting blood pressure.
She received unsuccessful cardioversion but then converted to NSR after two amiodarone loads.
Amiodarone was started and then discontinued after milrinone was stopped.
She had intermittent afib throughout her stay and was restarted on metoprolol.
She was given IVF boluses that temporarily improved her HR before her final decompensation.
She required phenylephrine in addition to milrinone initially.
With the administration of steroids and rate correction, the patient?????
However, on day of death hypotension returned and was not responsive to multiple pressors and IVF.
During the first day in the ICU, she failed to respond to 160 mg of Lasix followed by a Lasix gtt at 20mg/h as well as metolazone.
A temporary line was placed and CVVH initiated.
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Prior to intubation the patient was altered in excess of her baseline anxiety.
LP was attempted at bedside but not able to be completed.
FEVER (WITH NEUTROPENIA):  Cefepime, Flagyl, and micafungin for empiric coverage of earlier fevers.
Vancomycin had been started before VRE was identified.
Given this, continuing linezolid for VRE.
Three days prior to death linezolid was changed to daptomycin due to suppressed cell counts.
Methylprednisolone was started for likely engraftment syndrome.
She was given vitamin K. Seems out of proportion to liver impairment.
Transaminitis: LFTs increased slightly from yesterday, unclear significance but not likely hypoxic/shock, no new infections or toxic medication effect.
