Surgical sutures are again noted in the right lower quadrant.
A vascular stent again projects over the low pelvis.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was performed following administration of oral and intravenous contrast.
CT ABDOMEN: Nasogastric tube has been removed.
The dosages of his outpatient beta-blocker were increased significantly to keep his heart rate under 120.
Once the patient's heart rate was stable he was transferred to the oncology service, where he was kept on telemetry and remained stable.
No further management or dose adjustments were required.
His abdominal pain was treated with dilaudid, morphine and a fentanyl patch.
Initially he was covered with levofloxacin and flagyl for infectious etiologies however this was not likely as the patient remained afebrile, and flagyl was discontinued.
The patient was made NPO and an aggressive bowel regiment was tried which successfully decreased the patient's abdominal pain post-bowel movement.
His fentanyl patch dose and breakthrough pain medications were decreased.
Levofloxacin was continued for a full course.
This was felt likely secondary to his lack of sleep while in the hospital, however causes such as pain medications and possible worsening of malignancy with metastatis were considered.
Infectious work-up was negative, and the patient had been on levofloxacin and completed a full course for pneumonia.
His pain medications were decreased down to fentanyl patch of 25mcg and dilaudid only as needed.
