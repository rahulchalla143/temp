CXR [**2119-1-25**]: FINDINGS: A nasogastric tube is in place with tip terminating in the upper gastric fundus just distal to the gastroesophageal junction.
CXR [**2119-1-26**]: FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube with tip 4.5 cm from carina.
Nasogastric tube in unchanged position.
Severe portal/periportal and lobular mixed inflammation including neutrophils, plasma cells and eosinophils.
Hepatocellular necrosis, single cell apoptosis and cholestasis with focal bile duct proliferation and areas of collapse (Reticulin stain evaluated).
DDX was broad and included viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, infiltrative liver metastasis or primary, sclerosis, cholangiocarcinoma or hepatobiliary cancer related to [**Doctor Last Name **] II, reaction to medication (concern re: OTC cholesterol med), PBC, or PSC.
Her iron studies were not consistent with hemochromotosis and her ceruloplasmin were wnl.
A transjugular biopsy was performed on [**2119-1-20**] which demonstrated severe portal/periportal and lobular mixed inflammation including neutrophils, plasma cells and eosinophils.
In addtion, she was also found to have hepatocellular necrosis, single cell apoptosis and cholestasis with focal bile duct proliferation and areas of collapse (Reticulin stain evaluated).
Therefore she was given a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis and started on IV solumedrol for treatment.
In addition, given her worsening mental status, the pt was also started on lactulose and rifaximin as well.
She was given a trial of IVF bolus, however did not respond indicating more likely HRS vs. ATN.
In the MICU, the pt was continued on IV steroids for her autoimmune hepatitis, as well as her lactulose and rifaximin for her altered mental status.
She was also started on octreotide and midodrine for presumed HRS.
Despite all aggressive measures including blood pressure support with levophed as well as mechanical ventilation, the pt continued to decline.
However given her poor prognosis, the pt was declined for liver transplant and shortly thereafter she was also declined for hemodialysis.
After significant discussion with the family, the pt was made CMO given her poor prognosis.
The pt was given a trial of vit K x 3 days and received FFP as well as cryoglobulin.
However when the prognosis became apparent, further transfusions were held.
Given the concern for HRS, the pt was started on midodrine and octreotide without much improvement.
Given the gravity of her illnes, however, the pt was started on levofloxocin for broad spectrum antibiotic coverage.
Levofloxcain was chosen for broad spectrum pulmonary source as she had some cough and an episode of hematemesis on [**2119-1-18**] with CXR findings of ?atelectasis.
She was started on Fe supplements.
DVT prophylaxis was not initiated given her coagulopathy.
