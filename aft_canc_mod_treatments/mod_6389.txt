Three predominately hypoechoic masses in the liver, one in the right lobe containing heterogeneous echotexture with internal vascularity.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a very nice 39-year-old woman with metastatic NSCLC to the bone and brain who recently was taken off her Keppra who comes with multiple seizures.
This is secondarily caused by her CNS metastases of her NSCLC with recent decrease in dose of her Decadron and stopping her Keppra for abnormal LFTs.
She is currently back on steroids and Keppra and seizure free.
She will stay on dexamethasone 4 mg TID and Keppra 1 gram [**Hospital1 **].
(2) NSCLC Stage IV:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 3274**] will follow as outpatient in conjunction with Patient's oncologist close to home (per pt and oncologist request).
She already completed chemotherapy and 14 whole-brain radiation sessions.
Therefore we will started Bactrim DS for 3 days.
(6) Skin Rash:  This may be secondary to Keppra, but in the setting of recent seizures will monitor for now.
Antibiotics (vancomycin/cetriaxone in ER) etiology is less likely.
We will follow and use sarna lotion for now since risk of switching to other medications and having seizures or other adverse reaction outweighs benefits.
After 24 hours and hydration HR decreased to 80-90.
(7) PROPHYLAXIS: Subcutaneous heparin and bowel regimen.
Medications on Admission: Dexamethasone 4 mg PO four times a day.
Levetiracetam 500 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole 160-800 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for UTI for 2 days.
Dexamethasone 4 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice times a day.
Secondary Diagnsosis: Non-small cell lung cancer stage IV  Discharge Condition: Stable, seizure free, pain controled, ambulating, and tolerating PO.
You recently had your dexamethasone dose decreased and your Keppra stopped.
You were re-started on our keppra and your dexamethasone was increased.
We started you on an antibiotic for that and you will need to complete 2 more days at home.
