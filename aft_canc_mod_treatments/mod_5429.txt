Thin liquid, Nectar-thick liquid, honey thick liquid and pureed consistency barium were administered.
He could form a bolus with liquids, but no ground or solid consistencies were tested.
Pharyngeal contraction was better on the Right, and food and liquid tended to go down the right side.
ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: Aspiration occurred with all consistencies; thin liquid, nectar thick liquid, honey thick liquid and pudding.
We were able to reduce but not to eliminate the aspiration when he swallowed with a chin tuck, used the swallow-cough-swallow technique and alternated between bites of puree and sips of Nectar-thick liquid.
Remain strictly NPO for now with PEG feeds for nutrition,     hydration and medications  2.
Suggest medically treating his secretions to reduce them     with something like a Scopolamine patch  3.
Repeat videoswallow once his secretions have decreased     to see if he might be able to take small amounts of     nectar-thick liquids and pureed foods PO for pleasure     using a chin tuck, swallow-cough-swallow and alternating     consistencies  These recommendations were shared with the patient, the nurse and the medical team.
