Pre-operative work-up, including whole body PET-CT and brain MRI showed 2 lesions, a left adrenal and left lower lobe mass.
Pre-operative assesment confirmed non-small cell cancer with lung primary and given recent literature supporting surgical intervention in oligometastatic patients, the decision to proceed with a left lower lobe resection was elected.
Pre-operative PFTs and cardiac risk stratification revealed the patient to be an adequate candidate for the procedure and on [**2106-12-20**], the patient had an uncomplicated L-thoracotomy, left lower lobe lobectomy with a mediastinal lymph node dissection.

Her systolic BP was measured between 70-90 systolic and possible cardioversion was entertained.
However, after transfer to the [**Month/Day/Year 58879**], neosynephrine + amiodarone gtt was utilized and she converted to sinus rhythm the following day.
While in the [**Last Name (LF) 58879**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] MI protocol with cardiac markers was unrevealing and she was aggressively diuresed secondary to possible volume overload.
Re-bolus of IV amiodarone and continuation of her beta-blockade was successful in keeping her rate controlled initially, but, she remained in atrial fibrillation.
Cardiology consult obtained on [**2106-12-25**] recommended judicious use of amiodarone in conjunction with beta blockade.
This transiently worked, however, on POD5, she returned to a rapid rate and cardiology recommended a diltiazem drip with transition to an oral regimen of calcium channel blocker with an amiodarone taper (e.g.
400BID x2weeks, 400 QDaily x2weeks, 200BID x2 weeks, until 100QDaily x 2 weeks), cessation of her beta-blocker and intiation of anticoagulation accomplished with lovenox injections as a bridge to therapy with coumadin.
By discharge, she was stable on oral pain medication, tolerating a regular [**Doctor First Name **] diet although her blood sugars were slightly elevated.
She had received 2 days of coumadin and upon discharge, her INR was 1.9 after receiving 5 mg doses nightly.
She will take 2.5mg of coumadin the night of her discharge.
Lastly, she is to be discharged with home oxygen, keflex for superficial phlebitis of her IV site x7 days, lovenox injections to be administered by VNA with daily blood draws for INR also drawn by VNA.
