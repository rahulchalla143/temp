Admission Date:  [**2168-2-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-5-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2113-2-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ipratropium And Derivatives / Peanut Containing Products / Acyclovir  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: Febrile neutropenia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central line placement bronchoscopy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 54-year-old man with a history of plasma cell leukemia/myeloma with IgG paraprotein complicated in the past by DVT/PE, who is day 11 s/p DPACE.
He was admitted for DPACE on [**2168-2-12**] due to rapid progression of disease (markedly elevated IgG level) s/p Cytoxan on [**2-1**].
He has a rash on his scalp and face consistent with folliculitis which has been present since discharge.
He denied any nasal congestion, sore throat, headache, chest pain, dysuria, hesitancy or urinary frequency.
Status post hyper-CVAD x2 cycles in [**1-/2165**] and 01/[**2165**].
Status post Cytoxan 750 mg/m2 for 2 days with Decadron pulses followed by thalidomide at 200 mg daily in 2/[**2165**].
This treatment was complicated by a left leg DVT for which he was started on coumadin.
Status post autologous stem cell transplant in 05/[**2165**].
Noted for recurrent disease and treated on the Revlimid/Velcade study, number 04-130 with excellent response to treatment from [**7-/2166**] until [**1-/2167**], however discontinued on protocol due to pulmonary embolism in 01/[**2167**].
Started maintenance Velcade in [**8-/2167**] with three and half cycles of therapy given his first cycle was given without Decadron, Decadron added for the subsequent cycles.
Initiated treatment with Revlimid alone on [**2167-12-16**] with increasing doses for 21-day cycle with therapeutic Lovenox to 100 mg b.i.d.
Given cytoxan therapy on [**2-1**], tolerated well.
[**2-24**] Skin biopsy: Skin, right face  (A): Skin with central dilated follicle and mild perifollicular chronic inflammation.
If clinically warranted, patient should return for post-contrast images.
Findings are most consistent with a neoplastic process, and bronchoscopy would have a high yield for diagnosis.
Discharge labs   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 54-year-old man w/ history of plasma cell leukemia/multiple myeloma who has hx of PE during treatment with Revlimid, s/p recent DPACE treatment here with febrile neutropenia.
# Plasma cell leukemia/myeloma: The patient recently received DPACE and was persistently neutropenic.
He was originally started on Cefepime monotherapy for febrile neutropenia and Bactrim and Valacyclovir were continued for PCP and HSV prophylaxis respectively.
The revlimid was restarted with decadron on [**3-1**] for four days.
He was also started on lovenox for DVT prophylaxis given his history of PE while on Revlimid.
Patient was started on pentostatin/TBI mini-allo SCT.
Revlimid and lovenox were stopped prior to transplant.
Patient was given pentostatin and TBI with Day 0 was [**4-5**] he tolerated the transplant well but had muscle pain.
Therefore he was started thalidomide [**4-28**] for treatment of myeloma as his disease was previously responsive to this.
Given that he previously had a DVT/PE on this regimen, he was started on heparin gtt with a goal of 50-70  and give platelets with goal of >50 .
# Dyspnea: Respiratory distress several times week of [**4-18**] and eventually needed [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay with 1 night of BiPAP after bronchoscopy thought to be due to pulmonary edema but with only mild improvement with lasix.
Also with concern for engraftment syndrome or DAH, but with little improvement with steroids or evidence on bronchoscopy.
Will continue posaconazole at treatment dosage.
Initially required a fentanyl PCA that was converted to a fentanyl patch that was removed o n [**4-29**].
Was started on metoprolol and eventually achieved control at metoprolol 75 mg. .
He was initially placed on Cefepime and Vancomycin, however after his cultures grew out he was changed to Meropenem and Vancomycin.
Multiple blood cultures were negative and cefepime and vancomycin were stopped after he was afebrile for 2 weeks.
He went on to receive blood transfusions for the remainder of the hospitalization.
He developed a second rash on [**2-25**] which seemed related in timing to the initiation of Meropenem and Vancomycin.
As this was deemed the most appropriate antibiotic regimen, he was started on atarax 4x/day with good response in the rash.
His creatinine continued to improve with hydration but again worsened when being diuresed for concern of volume overload.
# Transaminitis- patient has underlying fatty liver seen on RUQ US and MRI and then voriconazole was started which caused a rise in his LFTs.
Vorinconazole was stopped after 2 days and LFTs continued to rise for days and then trended down.
He was treated with ursodiol as well.
LFTs remained normal after transplant and stayed normal while being treated on posaconazole.
