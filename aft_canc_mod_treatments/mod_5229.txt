History of Present Illness: This is a 65 y/o woman with no known past medical history (she has not had medical care in about 20 years), who presented to the ED at an OSH complaining of abdominal pain.
Her blood pressures transiently decreased to SBP of the 70s, and she was started on a dopamine gtt (1 mcg/min).
She received one dose of mucomyst at 1700.
Was started on NS with 2 amps of bicarb at 250cc/hr for 800cc.
Pulsus 5 Gen - sleepy, arousable, accessory muscle use HEENT - PERRL, extraocular motions intact, sclera anicteric, mucous membranes moist, no OP lesions Neck - no JVD, no thyromegaly Nodes - no cervical, supraclavicular, axillary lymphadenopathy Chest - distant breath sounds throughout, no w/c/r.
She was started on empiric therapy with heparin.
She was intubated and remained on ventilatory support for 8 days.
A left subclavian line was placed for hemodynamic monitoring.
Her first attempt at extubation was not successful due to pt drowsiness.
The Renal service was consulted and they recommended CVVHD dialysis which she underwent over the following 7 days with improvement in her urine output and creatinine measurement.
She was treated empirically with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and flagyl.
Her fevers improved after her second day in the MICU, and her antibiotics were discontinued after surgery.
Altered mental status: On presentation, the patient had altered mental status that was thought to be secondary to taking dilaudid and benzodiazepine at OSH.
On her second day, she underwent paracentesis under ultrasound guidance to improve her respiratory status and to R/O bacterial peritonitis.
A second paracentesis was performed under ulstrasound guidance with 1l fuild drained.
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2028**] from gynecology-oncology recommended exploratory laparotomy for likely ovarian cancer once stabilised.
She was taken to the OR on [**2-18**], eight days following her initial presentation.
* The patient was taken to the operating room where she underwent exploratory laparotomy, supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, partial omentectomy, pelvic mass resection for large mass from R ovary.
Wound: On post-op day #2, the patient was found to have a wound infection for which she completed a 5 day course with vancomycin with complete resolution.
A chest X-ray revealed worsening collapse of her RLL and her RML.
Pulmonary medicine was consulted and they felt strongly that this was likely secondary to atelectasis and mucus plugings but could not rule out pneumonia or pulmonary embolus.
Moreover, given her ventilatory defects, a VQ scan was not recommended either.
As pulmonary embolus could not be definitively ruled out, they recommended empiric therapy with lovenox.
She was started on lovenox and will continue this for 6 months.
She also received chest PT, nebuliser and Advair and improved significantly.
She was weaned off of oxygen on post-op day #7.
