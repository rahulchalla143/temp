Admission Date: [**2165-6-24**]        Discharge Date: [**2165-7-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2086-5-7**]        Sex:  F  Service:  CSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 16590**] had undergone a coronary artery bypass graft on [**2165-6-14**] and was subsequently discharged to rehabilitation on [**2165-6-23**].
She was readmitted after being in rehabilitation for approximately 36 hours on the evening of [**6-24**] with complaints of the acute onset of shaking chills, rigors, a fever to 103 at the rehabilitation facility, as well as hypotension to the 70s systolic.
The patient had been pan-cultured at that time and was admitted to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit/Intensive Care Unit for intravenous Neo-Synephrine to manage her hypotension.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for chronic lymphocytic leukemia as well as a previous coronary artery bypass graft (as previously stated), hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and a previous history of esophageal dilatations.
Please see previous Discharge Summary for details of previous hospitalization during her coronary artery bypass graft.
Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
Pravastatin 40 mg by mouth once per day.
Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
Metoprolol XL 25 mg by mouth once per day.
Prednisone 20 mg by mouth once per day.
The patient was placed on an intravenous Neo- Synephrine drip.
The patient was immediately started on vancomycin and levofloxacin intravenously while waiting bacteria.
She was also given a stress dose of steroids in the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit.
She was placed on intravenous hydrocortisone.
The patient had an arterial line placed and was seen by the Critical Care staff - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] - who agreed with aggressive hydration and pressors to support her blood pressure.
We obtained an Infectious Disease consultation, and it was at their recommendation that we continue quinolone as well as vancomycin initially.
The levofloxacin was switched to ciprofloxacin while we were waiting for the final cultures because of the interaction with sotalol which she had been placed on during her previous admission for atrial fibrillation and a combination of prolongation of the Q-T interval less likely to occur with the combination of ciprofloxacin than it was with levofloxacin.
The patient subsequently had gram-negative rods in her blood as well as in her urine, and this has turned out to all be the same bacteria which was a resistant Escherichia coli sensitive to meropenem - which she was ultimately placed on.
The sotalol was discontinued for a couple of days but was ultimately resumed as her heart rate and blood pressure improved.
It was also the recommendation of the Urology Service as well as the Infectious Disease Service to continue suppressive antibiotic treatment due to her recurrent urinary tract infections.
The patient ultimately had a PICC catheter placed.
It was the recommendation of the Infectious Disease Service to continue meropenem intravenously for a total of a 2-week course and then to convert her to Macrodantin by mouth for six months for chronic suppression of urinary tract infections.
Enteric coated aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
Multivitamin one  tablet by mouth once per day.
Folic acid 5 mg by mouth once per day.
Vitamin A 25,000 units one by mouth every day.
Sotalol 40 mg by mouth once per day.

Coumadin 2 mg by mouth once per day (this is to be    followed with INR checks at least twice per week and    titrated accordingly for a target INR of 2 to 2.5).
Prednisone 50 mg once per day (which was just    decreased today - [**7-3**]).
She is to have complete blood counts followed during    this weaning period to be followed by her primary care    physician to aid in the weaning of the prednisone.
Meropenem 1 gram intravenously q.8h.
She was also to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**] upon discharge from rehabilitation (telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 285**]).
Status post coronary artery bypass graft.
