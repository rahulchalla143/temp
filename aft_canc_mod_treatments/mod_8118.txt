He reports his tumor was found during a procedure for skin cancer in which there was difficulty during intubation.
ENT performed laryngoscopy which showed left exophytic portion of mass clearly viewed on fiberoptic exam, while right and posterior portion appreciated as obliteration of right pyriform and post-cricoid space.
He was given Decadron 5 mg IV and transferred to MICU for monitoring.
Past Medical History: Basal cell cancer Hypothyroidism Pneumonia Anemia ETOH abuse Hyperlipidemia Hypopharyngeal mass   Social History: denies smoking, prior to admission pt reportedly had several drinks of ETOH daily  Family History: no history of head and neck cancer   Physical Exam: Admission Exam 102.1 98 127/65 98%humidified face tent General: Alert, oriented.
Moderate respiratory distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL Neck: large anterior cervical mass CV: Difficult to hear over his upper airway sounds Lungs: Prominent upper airway sounds.
[**2155-9-1**]   FINDINGS:  Multiple fluoroscopic images of the left hip in the operating room demonstrate interval placement of a dynamic compression screw with associated fracture plates and screws fixating an intertrochanteric fracture of the left proximal femur.
DIAGNOSIS: I.  Hypopharyngeal tumor biopsy (A-B): Squamous cell carcinoma, invasive, poorly differentiated, extending to tissue edges.
The specimen was partially submitted for frozen section examination and the frozen section diagnosis by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10940**] is:  "Positive for carcinoma, favor squamous cell".
It consists of multiple red/tan tissue fragments that measure 2.1 x 2 x 1 cm in aggregate.
Right PIC line has been withdrawn to the brachiocephalic vein, several centimeters proximal to its junction with the left.
The PICC line has been adjusted since previous imaging and now is located with the tip 2 cm above the carina.
Surgical fixation device in the left proximal femur remains unchanged.
G tube placement by IR [**2155-9-12**] CONCLUSION: Uncomplicated percutaneous gastrostomy placement as above with a 12 French wills [**Doctor Last Name 12433**] gastrostomy tube.
The tube may be used for feeding in 24 hours.
In this continuous recording, there was diffuse background slowing with 6-7 Hz theta activity superimposed with delta activity.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from wakefulness to sleep with no additional findings.
There is suggestion of a cutoff of the left main stem bronchus.
Left chest tube remains in place.
Bibasilar opacities , a combination of large effusions and adjacent consolidations are unchanged.
These consolidations could be due to atelectasis but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
Right PICC tube is in the lower SVC.
Infiltrative tumor in the post-cricoid region involving the right hypopharynx and esophagus with focal airway narrowing and effacement again noted.
Bilateral pneumothoraces with right pleural effusion.
Endotracheal tube and the left-sided chest tube are in constant position.
POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE PREPARATION (Final [**2155-9-30**]):       NO FUNGAL ELEMENTS SEEN.
POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE PREPARATION (Final [**2155-9-29**]):       Test cancelled by laboratory.
Left-sided chest tube is in unchanged position projecting in mid left hemithorax.
Right-sided PICC line ends in lower SVC.
Could not place NG tube in OR.
PEG placed [**2155-9-12**], and tube feeds were begun.
Exam was suggestive of upper airway compromise, and there was concern for obstruction secondary to tumor mass effect although acuity of decompensation would be unusual for mass progression.
In the peri-intubation period, he became hypotensive likely related to the medications used for intubation.
He required 1 pressor but was quickly weaned off.
Pt was covered broadly with vancomycin and meropenem (he previously completed an 8-day course of vanc/cefepime/clinda earlier in his hospitalization).
Patient has known bilateral pneumothoraces after bilateral chest tube placement, stable from prior.
[**10-8**] mini-BAL did not show any organisms on gram stain.
Pt was transferred back to the medical floor for continued management on [**10-9**].
While on medical floor pt completed full course of IV Vanco/Meropenum and ID followed pt.
Patient had subsequent anemia requiring transfusions [**9-14**] and [**9-17**], [**10-17**] thrombocytopenia (which resolved without necesitating platelet transfusion), and neutropenia (treated with neupogen earlier in admission).
Pt restarted chemotherapy on [**2155-10-15**] and started day 1 of 30 of XRT on [**2155-10-14**].
Pt received chemotherapy on [**2155-10-22**] (day of discharge) and will continue chemo as outpatient on [**2155-10-29**].
# Left proximal humerus fracture and femur fracture.
got 1 unit of blood in the OR and another unit in MICU post op.
Lovenox will be continued after discharge for DVT prophylaxis as pt has not been ambulating and will defer to rehab facility to readdress whether pt needs it once he is ambulating on own out of bed.
Lovenox was briefly held after chemo when platelet counts fell below 50, but was then restarted.
no range of motion restrictions, no weight bearing restrictions, humerus non op management with sling for comfort.
Pericardial effusion, pleural effusions: Patient appeared chronically volume overloaded on exam after transfer to oncology service, had no known history of cardiac disease.
Pulsus was difficult to measure due to right sided PICC line and LUE edema secondary to fracture and lymphadenopathy, but was approximately 8.
Cardiology was consulted, and judged that the effusion was too small for safe percutaneous drainage.
Response to diuresis variable.
Patient started on ciprofloxacin for UTI, urine culture grew Klebsiella sp.
CXR later became c/w PNA and given history of aspiration, he was started on unasyn [**2155-9-2**].
Unasyn was ultimately discontinued and he was continued on cipro with continued improvement.
Upon to transfer to oncology service and given continued opacities suggestive of aspiration on CXR, anitbiotics were switched to levofloxacin and clindamycin [**2155-9-7**], which were continued for a 5 day course.
The patient developed another fever on [**2155-9-20**], and was broadly covered with vanc, cefepime and clindamycin given risk for skin infections due to pressure ulcers as well as aspiration risk.
Cultures negative, antibiotics discontinued [**2155-9-26**].
Pt was started on voriconazole on [**10-4**] but this was switched to micafungin on [**10-7**] due to concerns about possible QT prolongation.
ID followed pt and initially started Micafungin which was later switched to Fluconazole.
Pt to remain on Fluconazole for several more weeks until his appointment with ID on [**2155-11-26**].
Pt's PICC line was somewhat erythematous on [**10-7**] and was removed.
[**10-8**] mini-BAL did not show any organisms on gram stain.
Thyroid hormone supplementation was not initiated initially.
TSH found to be elevated on repeat testing in course of workup for hyponatremia and thyroid hormone supplementation was begun.
