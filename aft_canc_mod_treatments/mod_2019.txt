[**2122-6-29**] Bladder Pressure: 36  Brief Hospital Course: HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA, ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Mr. [**Known lastname 42512**] is a 72yo man w/ progressive HCC with metastatic liver lesions who was initially admitted for treatment of hyponatremia and possible initiation of chemotherapy.
Surgery was consulted but did not want a surgical intervention; GI was also consulted and deferred colonoscopy.
Cystoscopy was performed on [**2122-6-28**] to verify there was no bladder outlet obstruction.
Ultimately it was felt that his worsening ascites was contributing to an abdominal compartment syndrome (bladder pressure was 36 on [**2122-6-29**]), causing decreased venous return with hypoperfusion as well as possibly effectively obstructing the ureters bilaterally.
Initially therapeutic tap was deferred as there was concern the fluid shifts could worsen his renal function.
A therapeutic tap was readdressed after intubation, but was unable to be performed prior to the patient passing away.
He became profoundly hypotensive and was placed on dopamine and albumin.
