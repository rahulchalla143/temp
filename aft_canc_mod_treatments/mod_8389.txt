Required trach ([**2168-7-21**])and PEG ([**2168-7-15**])for vocal cord paralysis secondary to b/l vocal cord paralysis and inability to protect airway.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where fluid was given and patient was started on antibiotics for group b strep bacteremia as well as coag negative staph.
She was started on levoquin on [**2168-8-1**] for questionable pneumonia and kept on levoquin for group b strep bacteremia.
A fib was rate controlled with beta blocker (metoprolol) and amiodarone.
Pt was also placed on mechanical ventilation through her trach to reduce myocardial oxygen demand.
Therapeutic thoracentesis was performed for R sided effusion--proved to be transudate.
Pt was weaned from ventilator and called back to the floor on [**2168-8-8**].
O2 sats were 85-90% on 35-40% via trach collar and increasing respiratory distress was noted throughout the night; she was using accessory muscles for breathing.
4 pm ABG 7.38/77/54 on 50% trach mask and at 6pm 7.41/67/53 on 60% trach mask.
Past Medical History: COPD colon CA (XRT and chemo) MV replacement A fib CAD s/p CABG HTN Hyperlipidemia arthritis Osteoporosis  Social History: Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] lives with her husband.

Patient is status post mitral valve replacement.
This is most likely related to the recent gastrostomy tube placement by the GI service.
Thoracic surgery was consulted and a biopsy of the R supraclavicular node was obtained, which showed poorly differentiated non-small cell lung CA.
A swallow study at this time found Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] to be at great risk for aspiration of liquids, so she was kept on a soft solid diet with no liquids.
Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was kept NPO, a PEG was placed that was advanced to a GJ tube because of poor GI motility and possible proximal obstruction.
Radation therapy was initiated in the hopes of shrinking the mediastinal masses and relieving the vc paralysis.
While in the hospital, Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] received multiple treatments of XRT as well as formal mapping.
Her radiation oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt that she had completed a course of palliative XRT and was not a candidate for further radiotherapy.
Mental status changes thought secondary to hypercarbia, but patient has continued to be withdrawn after hypercarbia corrected.
Ritalin 5 mg qd started [**2168-8-21**].
Haldol 0.5mg q4-6h prn agitation.
With persistant decreased mental status, ritalin increased to 10mg qd and celexa d/c'd for concern of mental status changes from serotonin syndrome.
As airway closure would be an even greater  risk with the new development, the plans for R VC medialization were suspended.
XRT was initiated in the hopes that the mediastinal LAD would be decompressed with resultant improvement of VC paralysis.
Rather than waiting for this to occur, it was decided that Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] should undergo a tracheostomy to ensure a patent airway.
She tolerated the procedure well and was followed by ENT and respiratory care post-op for trach management and suctioning.
She recveived nebulizers, chest CT, mucomyst, and supplemental O2 PRN and a steroid taper.
Her O2 sats on this regimen remained stable in the 95-99% range.
At first, she was able to tolerate only 3 hours on the tracheostomy mask before becoming acidotic.
However the patient began to fatigue after continued trials and eventually was requiring the ventilator for increasing periods of time.
The tracheostomy site was inspected and appeared to be oozing purulent and serosanginous fluid at times; interventional pulmonology, following consultation, felt that the site of tracheostomy was too large, and that it was erythematous, draining into the trachea.
The patient was treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and aztreonam for a 14 day day course.
Because she continued to spike after the vanco and levoflox were added, they were d/c'd, they were d/c'd and she was continued on a 14-day course of meropeen alone.
After a number of trials, it was felt that the likelihood was very low of her being able to be weaned off the ventilator.
In discussion with the patient that she would be most comfortable remaining on the ventilator without trying to wean off.
CVS--Because of her h/o MV replacement and Afib, Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was kept anticoagulated throughout the course of her hospitalization.
She was on a Heparin drip so that she could be weaned off for PEG placement and tracheostomy.
Anticoagulation was bridged on [**7-22**] and Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was to be sent to Rehab on coumadin with a goal INR of 2.5-3.5.
The HIT Ig came back negative, but given the time course, lack of other etiologies, and rebound of platelet count once off heparin, HIT seems likely.
Pt was switched to lepirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor, and restarted on her warfarin.
FEN--After the swallow study noted that Mrs.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was at great [**Doctor First Name **] for aspiration, it was determined that she would need a PEG tube for feeding.
She received a PEG on [**7-15**] and received promote with fiber advanced to a rate of 50cc/hr.
All of her meds were given either IV or through the PEG.
The patient was also started on metoclopramide for improved gastric motility but this was d/c'd after she has liquid c/diff (-) stools.
)Hypotension -- Concurrent with hemoptysis and ICU transfer, pt became hypotensive and was found to have gram + cocci on blood culture, and pt was put on vanco and levofloxacin.
Pt will require levofloxacin until [**8-22**], at which time she should have additional blood cultures drawn.
)Atrial fibrillation -- Pt's rate was well controlled on amiodarone and metoprolol.
Anticoagulation was achieved with lepirudin and later argatroban in order to be transitioned to warfarin.
)Anemia -- Secondary to chronic disease, without obvious source of blood loss.
It was initially interpreted that the patient desired comfort measures only except with ventilatory support, nebulizers, antiemetics, and morphine for pain control.
Code status was adjusted to add the patient's tube feeds, warfarin, and digoxin after the patient made it clear that she understood these to be part of comfort-oriented care.
