Placement of right central venous line.
Intubation/extubation   History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 66174**] is a 48 year old woman with M5b AML who has completed induction chemotherapy and three cycles of Ara-C consolidation and is now being admitted for an allogeneic stem cell transplant from her brother.
She denies heaches, chest pain, SOB, changes in her bowel habits, rashes, chills, night sweats.
Underwent 7+3 (with mitoxantrone) -> followed by 3 doses of AraC consolidation.
Comes in [**2194-1-24**] for allogeneic transplant from brother.
Cholecystectomy: during induction chemotherapy 2.

Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease, including hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis, cannot be excluded by ultrasound in the presence of fatty infiltration.
Endotracheal tube in good position.
[**2-28**] CXR: Status post right-sided thoracentesis without evidence for pneumothorax.
Diffuse mesenteric stranding and small-to-moderate ascites.
Further evaluation with gadolinium enhanced MRI is recommended.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
[**3-4**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: 1.
The most common explanation for this change would be a lessening of medication effect.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 66174**] is a 48 yo woman with M5 AML, s/p induction and consolidation who was admitted for an allogeneic SCT from her brother (recipient and donor CMV negative, A positive) with cytoxan and TBI conditioning.
AML She underwent an allogeneic SCT from her brother (recipient and donor CMV negative, A positive) with cytoxan and TBI.
Her cytoxan was held for one day due to elevated LFTs (ultrasound was normal with the exception of a fatty liver) but was then given after her LFTs trended down.
She received her cells on [**1-31**] and quickly became neutropenic.
Immunosuppression: She was started on continuous infusion cyclosporine on day -1 and this was adjusted for a goal 475-525. .
She was started on steroids (35 mg of solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]) and entocort and her diarrhea improved.
Her steroids were then tapered down.
ID: She was started on levofloxacin, fluconazole (this was stopped after several days due to elevated LFTs), and acyclovir per the alloSCT protocol.
On [**2-1**] she developed diarrhea which was c.difficile positive and she was started on flagyl.
She then had expected febrile neutropenia and both vancomycin and caspofungin were added.
As she recovered her white blood cells and remained afebrile, antibiotics were gradually stopped and she remained afebrile.
It was planned that she would continue to take flagyl for two weeks following the resumption of her counts (originally planned to finish [**3-4**]).
She will also take prophylactic fluconazole, acyclovir, and bactrim.
F/E/N: She was maintained on IVF and TPN was started when she began to develop mucositis.
The pt was started on neosonephrine for MAP<60 and tachycardia, lactate 6.8.
A RIJ line was placed.
Insulin gtt was started for FS in the 300s.
GIven BP of 76/57 maxed out on both levophed and neo, vasopressin was started.
The pt was given 3 amps of Na bicarb and then 1.5L of 3amps Na bicarb in D5W for her pH of 7.06.
Valganciclovir was added for empiric CMV coverage, IV Bactrim was started for empiric PCP coverage, and po Vanc was given for empiric C diff coverage.
MICU course: Her MICU course was quite complicated and included hypotension requiring up to three pressor agents at one point, renal failure that required one session of hemodialysis, elevated LFTS, question of TTP that required one session of plasmapheresis, multiple small cortical infarcts noted on her head CT/MRI, and questionable seizure activity that required both phenytoin and phenobarbital to control.
She worked with physical and occupational therapy and gradually regained motor function.
No seizure activity was noted, and she was continued on prophylactic dilantin.
However, d/t interaction of phenytoin with cyclosporin levels, she was transitioned to Keppra with a bridge of ativan 0.5 mg PO TID.
Ativan will be stopped once the patient is at 1000mg PO BID for 2 days (increased dose by a total of 250 mg QD).
The patient's blood counts remained stable and she did well from a transplant standpoint.
She was switched to PO cyclosporine prior to discharge and dose is still being adjusted in setting of interaction with phenytoin (needs to be increased).
Additionally, she had significant wasting of magnesium d/t cyclosporin, and she was maintained on 2400 mg of PO magnesium oxide without complications of diarrhea, and she was discharged on this dose (with the hope that magnesium wasting would decrease once cyclosporin dose decreased once phenytoin levels fall).
Her steroid taper continued, and she was switched from methylprednisolone IV to prednisone PO.
She remained afebrile and her cultures remained negative, so she was kept only on prophylactic acyclovir, bactrim, and fluconazole.
There was no other evidence of GVH, so it was felt that this was due to medication effect, and the plan was to likely stop fluconazole as an outpt to see if LFT's improved.
