Patient was loaded with Keppra 2g IV prior to transfer and was medflighted on propofol and midazolam.
He was maintained on propofol overnight with resolution of his seizure activity.
He was weaned off propofol the next morning and remained seizure-free.
He was also started on Vimpat in addition to Keppra for better control of his seizures.
However, patient had leukocytosis, so infectious work up was done and showed UCx with enterococcus, which was treated with ampicillin for x7 days.
His leukocytosis resolved with the treatment.
# Endo: patient's insulin was changed to regular insulin while he was maintained on tube feeding in the ICU.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for management of his insulin given the difficult to control blood glucose.
His insulin was changed to long acting insulin (NPH and insulin) when he began eating meals.
He had been started on high dose steroids as an outpatient, and it was continued during this hospitalization.
His prophylactic bactrim was stopped on admission but was restarted prior to discharge.
He will need to continue Bactrim prophylaxis while he is on high dose steroids.
He will also need to follow up with his nephrologists for further evaluation and management of his CKD.
# CV: He was maintained on telemetry monitoring.
# FEN: He was maintained NPO while intubated.
# PPX: He was maintained on S/C heparin and pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.
He was maintained on a bowel regimen and PPI for GI prophylaxis.
