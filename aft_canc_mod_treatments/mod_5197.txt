Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent his operation on [**2137-3-13**].
His operative course was complicated by splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy.
He otherwise tolerated the procedures well and was transferred to the SICU post-op.
His pain was controlled with an epidural and PCA.
His PCA was continued and he was eventually transitioned over to dilaudid po, which controlled his pain well.
CV: Patient developed A. Fib on POD#1 and was started on an amiodarone drip.
He was eventually transitioned to PO amiodarone taper and he converted back to and remained in sinus rhythm since [**3-16**].
His pleural fluid had inflammatory cells but was negative for malignant cells.
His oxygen requirement remained high despite diuresis and a Ct scan was done and subsegmenatl PE's were discovered.
Anticoagulation was started with a heparin drip and then transitioned to lovenox.
Coumadin was not started as of date of discharge.
He was comfortable on supplemental oxygen via nasal canula and was eventually discharged with oxygen.
GI: NPO with NGT until bowel function returned, NGT was removed on [**3-19**] and was started on clears [**3-20**] and advanced to full liquids.
GU: His UOP was stable throughout and the Foley catheter was removed after the epidural was discontinued.
A Foley had to be replaced after failure to void on [**3-19**].
His Foley was then removed on [**3-21**] and he voided afterwards.
This was most likely secondary to mediastinal oozing post-op and he was transfused 2 units of blood followed by lasix.
T/L/D:  Post-op, he had an NGT, neck JP drain along with an abdominal JP, a J-tube to gravity and a Foley catheter.
The neck JP and Foley catheter were eventually removed ([**3-20**] and [**3-21**], respectively), the NGT was removed [**3-19**].
Therefore, he was recommended to a [**Hospital1 1501**] with supplemental oxygen after discharge.
