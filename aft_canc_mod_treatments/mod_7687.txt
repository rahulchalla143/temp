[**2163-1-27**] Right UE Doppler Deep vein thrombosis seen in one of the right brachial veins and  occlusive thrombus is also seen in the right basilic vein   Brief Hospital Course: Pt [**Name (NI) **] Was admitted as an OSH transfer after being found to have an extensive interventricular hemorrhage.
He was intubated and had an emergent EVD placed by neurosurgery.
He was noted to be very hypertensive on admission and throughout his stay here requiring four antihypertensive agents for control.
In terms of his neurologic status he had interventricular tPA placed x 3 days with resolution of blood products.
He tolerated clamping of the EVD x24 hours and the drain was removed.
With regards to his pulmonary issues he did develop ARDS with some clinical improvement over the course of 15 days as his ventilator settings have been slowly weaned down.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and it was recommended that he finish off a course of ciprofloxacin and cephalexin for a total of 3 weeks.
Below is the antibiotic course: Cefepime           [**Date range (1) 29682**] Cefazolin 2gIVQ8   3/9-3-14 Vancomycin         [**Date range (1) 59479**]  To end [**2163-3-1**].
Ciprofloxacin start [**1-30**]- Cephalexin 500 Q12hrs [**2-7**]-  Fever was noted throughout his stay.
He was placed on 4 antihypertensive agents but this has been changed daily as his blood pressure has been under better control.
His medications should be titrated to SBP 95-160 goal.
Because he had high blood pressure a screening test for pheochromocytoma was initiated but an endocrine consult stated that the tests are not interpretable during this acute phase and recommended they get tested once he is no longer infected, stable, and off a beta blocker.
He had a PEG and trach placed.
He tolerated the PEG and tube feeds he developed diarrhea but failed to show infection in his stool.
