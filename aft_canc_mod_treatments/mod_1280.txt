The tracheal Y-stent has been placed in the interim, and remains widely patent, without extrinsic compression.
Interval increase in now moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions, with bibasilar atelectasis.
Ground-glass opacity within the anterior segment of the right upper lobe abutting the minor fissure is new compared with prior, is nonspecific.
Left breast mass, with adjacent surgical clips and skin thickening, better evaluated with mammography.
Persistent small left pleural effusion with resolution of prior right pleural effusion.
Pleural Fluid ([**2189-5-20**]): The cytology specimen shows rare atypical epithelioid cells in a background of reactive mesothelial cells, histiocytes, and scattered predominantly small lymphocytes.
Mammoglobin and GCDFP are noncontributory.
FISH ([**2189-5-21**]): FISH evaluation for a MYC rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the LSI MYC Dual Color Break Apart Rearrangement Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) at 8q24 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
A normal MYC FISH finding can result from absence of a MYC rearrangement, from an atypical MYC rearrangement, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
A normal FISH finding can result from the absence of IGH@-BCL2 rearrragement, from a variant IGH@-BCL2 rearrangement, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Admission: 74 year old woman with a h/o breast cancer, right clavicular squamous cell carcinoma, chronic HCV, and GERD with known large right infraclavicular mass impinging on her esophagus, trachea, and SVC syndrome, s/p XRT, recent transbronchial biopsy and Y-stent placement by IP, now with [**Year (2 digits) 9140**] dyspnea.
