His last dose of irinotecan and panitumab chemotherapy was Monday [**2134-3-29**] (patient reports was [**4-12**] but not recorded in OMR), and he reports always getting diahrrea with his chemotherapy.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1683**] is a 72 yo M with h/o metastatic rectal CA and SVC syndrome, now resolved on lovenox tx, who was admitted to OMED on [**4-19**] with intractable diarrhea thought [**3-2**] chemo and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**4-24**] with BRBPR and hematemesis.
They recommended PPI and carafate slurry.
They were concerned that patient's whole GI tract was diffusely inflamed as was seen on EGD and that the anastamotic site from his colectomy might be a bleeding source; a flex sigmoidoscopy was done on as well and showed as well diffuse ulceration and inflammation.
The patient was started on steroid enemas and mesalamine suppositories to decrease inflammation.
The steroid enemas were discontinued, but the mesalamine suppositories were continued through to discharge.
Infectious diseases was consulted and the patient was switched to nafcillin with confirmation of MSSA.
The patient however despite aggressive crystalloid and colloid (albumin, a further 2 units of blood) resuscitation then developed sepsis related acute tubular necrosis.
Hemodialysis was initiated which the patient tolerated well, and a permanent tunneled catheter line was placed on [**2134-5-7**].
The patient was started on phosphate binders, nephrocaps and erythropoeitin dosed at hemodialysis.
The carafate was discontinued due to risk of aluminum toxicity.
The nafcillin was also changed to Cefazolin dosed 2mg at each [**Date Range 2286**] session for ease of administration and avoiding extra volume loading.
Should the patient miss [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2286**] session, extra doses of cefazolin should be administered as needed.
The patient was planned for a 28 day course of cefazolin to be finished on [**2134-5-22**].
His BP initally recovered with 500cc NS bolus.
He was bolused NS and given PRBC with improved HR to the 110s, and BP to 120s/80s.
s/p TPA infusion followed by venous angioplasty with balloon dilation with resolution of symptoms.
He was initially treated with lovenox (dose recalculated this admission, should be lower than his admission dose), but this was held secondary to GI bleed.
#Diarrhea - the patient continued to have diarrhea that was controlled with titration of his anti-diarrheal medications.
Infectious sources were ruled out and the cause was likely irinotecan-induced GI toxicity and radiation proctitis.
During volume resuscitation the patient became grossly edematous, and albumin was administered to little effect.
The patient slowly became less edematous when [**Year (4 digits) 2286**] was initiated and ultrafiltration was started.

We believe the diarrhea was a side effect of the chemotherapy you had received; it was treated with 3 anti-diarrheal medications.
You also have a low blood pressure on admission, this was likely due to dehydration in the setting of diarrhea, and it improved with rehydration with IV fluids.
This severely damaged your kidneys, requiring you to be started on hemodialysis.
You had a permanent [**Location (un) 2286**] catheter placed and you will need to continue getting [**Location (un) 2286**] 3 times a week.
You were started on several new medications when you were admitted.
