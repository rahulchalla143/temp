<br> PRELIMINARY REPORT: Gastrostomy tube terminates in the esophagus, repositioning is recommended.
<br> In the epigastric region, a percutaneous gastrostomy has been placed into the gastric antrum.
Oral contrast has been administered via the gastrostomy tube, which opacifies the lower esophagus.
The gastrostomy tube has been placed percutaneously into the gastric antrum, but the tube is oriented cephalad, with the tip in the lowermost esophagus.
Other procedures: As ulcers and duodenitis were considered low risk, decision was made to proceed with PEG placement.
A 20FR percutaneous gastrostomy tube (PEG) was placed successfully using standard techniques at the stomach body.
<br> Impression: Atrophy in the antrum Low risk ulcers and duodenitis in the duodenal bulb Successful PEG placement (PEG) Question of small submucosal mass in duodenal bulb.
