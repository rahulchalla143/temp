The Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the cavoatrial junction.
Soft tissue density mass posterior to the tracheostomy catheter was seen on prior CT scan and is consistent with patient's metastatic esophageal cancer.
Brief Hospital Course: 40 yo F with metastatic esophageal carcinoma s/p recent initiation of carboplatin and 5fu, s/p trach in past, admitted to oncology with febrile neutropenia and transferred for concerning increased stridor and narrowed airway.
Area of concern from prior imaging was in cervical esophagus, so would be above area of possible trach.
Pt received IV decadron without improvement.
She was evaluated by thoracic surgeons who took her emergently to the OR for trach placement with heliox given prior.
After the procedure she continued to spike fever, was tachycardic, was acutely dropping her oxygen sats.
# Neutropenic fever/sepsis: Patient spiking fevers to 101 on cefepime on the floor.
She also dropped her pressures and was started on levo (weaned off on [**3-29**]) and boluses IVF to maintain a MAP> 65 and a CVP>10.
She was continued on filgrastim and was no longer neutropenic as of [**2131-3-31**].
However, cefepime will not be covered by her insurance so we started ciprofloxacin instead on [**4-4**] and we recommend two days of treatment on cipro and then discontinuing the cipro.
Has been persistent despite fluid resuscitation, transfusion, and correction of hypercalcemia in past.
Her sinus tachycardia did not respond to fluid resuscitation in the ICU.
