Admission Date:  [**2195-1-28**]     Discharge Date:  [**2195-2-2**]   Service:  CARDIAC CRITICAL CARE UNIT  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84 year-old white female with multiple medical problems including hypertension, severe peripheral vascular disease, awaiting revascularization recently admitted to NABH for preoperative catheterization, which was complicated by severe groin bleeding.
The patient was initially scheduled to undergo an elective RLE angiogram by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**1-30**].
Postoperative course was complicated by groin hematoma and bleeding requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells and emergent operative care by vascular surgery.
Postoperatively, the patient experienced severe pain and received morphine and Fentanyl.
On her pain management the patient became very somnolent, disoriented.
On [**1-26**] the patient was more awake and oriented as her pain medication was tapered off, but experienced elevated blood pressures as high as 240/50.
The patient was begun on a Diltiazem drip and nitroglycerin drip and transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further management.
ALLERGIES:  Codeine and beta blocker, causing bronchospasm in the past, but tolerating beta blocker recently.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers b.i.d., Procardia XL 30 mg q.d., Clonidine .4 mg q week, Lasix 20 q.d., Prevacid 30 q.d., aspirin 81 q.d., Diovan 320 mg q day, Hydrea 500 mg q three days, Levoxyl .05 q.d., Digoxin .125 mg q.d., magnesium oxide 400 mg b.i.d., Diltiazem drip, nitroglycerin drip titrated to blood pressure.
Left lower quadrant site of prior surgical drains with surrounding ecchymosis.
Left groin staples in place, dried blood surrounding, but otherwise clean and dry.
IMPRESSION/PLAN:  The patient is an 84 year-old female, labile hypertension, severe peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure with a recent catheterization with left anterior descending coronary artery and left circumflex stenosis with catheterization complicated by groin hematoma requiring operative repair, transferred with hypertension and transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for intervention of her coronary arteries.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient's left anterior descending coronary artery and left circumflex stenosis on catheterization [**1-22**], the patient will get cardiac intervention via Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] prior to lower extremity revascularization.
She has a history of beta blocker intolerance.
It looks as if Dobutamine beta blocker was tolerated at NABH.
Will continue Diltiazem drip for now for blood pressure and heart rate control and will continue [**Last Name (un) **].
EF is not known, although cardiac output looks well on catheterization at 4.7, continue Lasix and [**Last Name (un) **], follow volume status, diurese as needed.
Hypertension/heart rate:  Elevated blood pressure on po Lasix.
Continue [**Last Name (un) **], continue Procardia and Clonidine.
Now the patient is on nitroglycerin and Diltiazem GTT.
Will continue above po regimen for now, but discuss alternating it in the morning per attending physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient will get a trial of po Hydralazine.
Will defer starting antibiotics for now pending chest x-rays and cultures and monitoring temperature.
We will follow up with this and continue wet to dry dressing changes for a right lower extremity ulcer.
Renal:  Chronic renal insufficiency, creatinine okay now.
Will follow mental status and give low dose morphine and/or Percocet for pain control.
[**Month (only) 116**] need to discuss the issue of anticoagulation with a history of CML.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had cardiac catheterization with intervention on [**2195-1-29**].
The patient had a stent placed in her left anterior descending coronary artery.
The patient is on minor pain control using Percocet prn.
The patient's Diltiazem drip as well as nitroglycerin drip were weaned to off.
The patient was placed on beta blocker and has been doing well with no bronchospasm or issues due to allergies.
The patient's blood pressure medications have been titrated to maximum for better blood pressure and heart rate control.
The patient did have a seven day course of Levaquin for a urinary tract infection.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Lasix 20 mg once a day, Diovan 320 mg once a day, Digoxin .125 mg once a day, Atrovent/Albuterol nebulized treatments, Procrit 30,000 once a week, Levoxyl .05 mg once a day, aspirin 81 mg once a day, Hydrea 500 mg q three days, Protonix 40 mg once a day, magnesium oxide 400 mg twice a day, Plavix 75 mg once a day, Lopressor 37.5 mg three times a day, Procardia 120 mg once a day, Tylenol as needed.
Coronary artery disease, cardiac intervention status post stent of left anterior descending coronary artery and left circumflex.
