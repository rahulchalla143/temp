It is noted that the right eleventh rib appears diffusely more sclerotic compared to other ribs, of uncertain clinical significance.
Findings concerning for tumor in the ascending colon with associated small bowel obstruction and obstruction of the right ureter, with right hydronephrosis.
If the patient does not require surgery for bowel obstruction, further assessment by colonoscopy would be recommended.
Indeterminate lesion along right paracolic gutter, inferior to liver tip, suspicious for peritoneal metastasis.
Dilated distal esophagus, filled with oral contrast.
Brief Hospital Course: Abdominal mass - Treated initially with broad spectrum antibiotics for possible ruptured appendix with periappendiceal abscess formation.
Given his poor nutritional status, and that surgery was unlikely to be curative if the mass were malignant, operative therapy was deferred.
After a family meeting with the medical team, social work, and palliative care, the patient was made comfort measures only, and expired on [**2153-10-11**] at approximately 2 AM.
Aspiration pneumonia - Treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, as above, and oxygen therapy.
IVC thrombus - Treated with heparin IV until recurrent GI bleeding led to its discontinuation.
Right hydroureteronephrosis - The consulting IR and urology teams did not recommend percutaneous nephrostomy due to a poor overall prognosis.
