Admission Date:  [**2101-12-10**]     Discharge Date: [**2101-12-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2041-6-11**]     Sex:  F  Service:  BMT  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old female with no significant past medical history, who presented to an outside hospital on [**2101-12-8**] with complaints of dyspnea on exertion and increasing pallor, and was found to be pancytopenic with a white blood cell count of 2.2, hematocrit of 18.5, and platelet count of 15,000.
The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells overnight at the outside hospital and her hematocrit rose to 28.4.
No antibiotics were started.
She rarely takes aspirin prn.
Bone marrow biopsy at the outside hospital showed hypercellular marrow with only a rare megakaryocyte, infrequent white blood cell overwhelming cell type.
He has dysplastic red cell maturation with frequent megacaryocyte blasts with well-defined nuclei, having frequent clover leaved and binucleate appearance.
Patient had a Hickman central line placed, and subsequently a chemotherapy protocol was initiated including idarubicin and cytarabine.
Initially patient tolerated this regimen well, but did subsequently develop febrile neutropenia at which point her antibiotic regimen was changed from empiric levofloxacin and fluconazole to cefepime, Vancomycin, and then AmBisome in addition.
Patient continued to spike fevers despite this broad-spectrum coverage.
Patient received blood cell transfusions for hematocrit less than 25, and also received platelet transfusions for platelet count less than 20,000.
She received an additional unit of platelets in the setting of a fall from her bed that resulted in a large left orbit hematoma superficially.
Infectious disease:  As described above, the patient was started on levofloxacin and fluconazole empirically.
Cefepime and then Vancomycin were added on her regimen on this day, and then on [**12-22**], AmBisome was initiated for broader spectrum coverage.
Cultures were sent including blood, both central and peripheral, urine and stool cultures.
However, given the high suspicion, Flagyl IV was added to her regimen for broader spectrum coverage.
Patient had continued to spike fevers despite this broad-spectrum coverage, and was receiving Tylenol for fever control at the time of this dictation.
Because of her concerns about her nutritional status, TPN was initiated on [**12-24**].
Intravenous access:  Patient had a Hickman placed on [**12-13**].
Hickman was not successfully placed by Surgery, and therefore the Interventional Radiology team was consulted for immediate placement of a Hickman by fluoroscopy, which was successful.
She continued on prn oxycodone for control of her discomfort.
However, Flagyl was initiated out of concerns for this possibility.
Patient continued bowel regimen early on in her hospital stay with the use of oxycodone.
Peridex, Gelclair, and Nystatin were used for mouth care.
The patient had received a unit of platelets overnight, and at the time of the fall her platelet count was 70,000.
Ice was applied to the patient's hematoma and an additional bag of platelets was transfused for bleeding control.
This discolored urine was controlled after a platelet transfusion.
It is likely related to the patient's chemotherapy regimen.
