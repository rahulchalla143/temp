It was decided to proceed with inpatient colonoscopy since he continued to have BRBPR and there was concern about monitoring his fluid status during prep for colonoscopy given his comorbidities (particularly severe AS).
Unfortunately colonoscopy on [**12-23**] showed a sigmoid mass, and pathology confirmed adenocarcinoma.
Due to his severe aortic stenosis, he was also evaluated by the cardiology service, who felt that he could proceed with surgery with intraoperative TEE monitoring and did not require valve replacement prior to surgery.
He received 1 unit pRBCs and his Hct appropriately increased.
He was evaluated by cardiology service pre-operatively, who felt he could proceed with surgery with intraoperative cardiac monitoring.
Hyperkalemia: Potassium was elevated on admission to 6.0 with EKG changes concerning for peaked T waves.
He received insulin/glucose/calcium and kayexolate and his potassium returned to [**Location 213**].
Felt unlikely to be related to losartan therapy since he had been on it for 2 years.
He was initially treated with clindamycin but then switched to IV ceftriaxone after speciation became available.
He was continued on his home IV ceftriaxone on admission, and he remained afebrile with nl WBC.
He completed his course of ceftriaxone on [**12-26**] (was treated for 4 weeks to empirically treat endocarditis although no vegetation was seen on TTE during previous admission).
Gastric ulcers:  Diagnosed on EGD during previous hospitalization in [**11-9**].
Pt was evaluated by anaesthesia and taken to the operating room for open sigmoid colectomy w/primary anastomosis.
Pt was extubated, taken to the TSICU overnight for close cardiopumonary monitoring with arterial line and swanz ganz catheter.
Patient recovered well without incident and was transferred to floor on POD 1 after removal of Swanz and Arterial line.
Post-operatively: Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout his recovery; pain was initially managed with a diluadid PCA and IV tylenol; he was transitioned to intermittent dilaudid on POD 2.
He was transitioned to oral pain medications on POD 5 but was put back on IV tylenol after having to place and NGT for vomiting.
He was again put on PO pain meds on POD 8 after diet was advanced and pain was well controlled.
Patient recieved fluid boluses PRN as well as albumin to keep pressures in an acceptable range and his beta blocker was held postoperatively until his pressures and HR improved.
GI/GU/FEN: He was initially kept NPO and he was advanced to sips on POD 1 and clears on POD 2.
On POD 8 NGT was d/c and he has advanced to sips without issue and a KUB was obtained after he stopped passing flatus and it showed colonic air - pt was given a suppository and began passing large amounts of flatus and had a BM which continued into POD 9 at which time he was advanced to a regular diet which was well tolerated.
A JP drain was discontinued on POD 4 and a stitch was placed which was removed before discharge.
C. diff was sent on POD 6 for liquid stools but were all negative.
Foley was dicontinued at midnight on POD 3 without incident.
PICC line was dinscontinued before discharge.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and [**Last Name (un) **] dyne boots were used during this stay; he was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.
