Epidural was removed on POD4 and pain control managed with intermittent morphine IV.
When tolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.
Per recommendations from geriatrics, narcotic pain medications were discontinued on POD9 secondary to increased risk delirium in geriatric population.
Pain control then managed with non-narcotic po medication.
Patient was found to be intermittently in atrial fibrillation and recommendations per cardiology were followed-beta blocker, amlodipine were titrated to appropriate heart rate and blood pressure.
Patient's fluid balance was carefully monitored and he intermittently received lasix vs fluid to achieve euvolemia such that he was adequately supported from a cardiovascular standpoint without fluid overload compromising his pulmonary status.
Patient also was transfused packed RBCs when appropriate to maintain adequate volume status without fluid overload.
Pulmonary: Postoperatively, patient required non-rebreather in ICU setting to maintain oxygenation.
As patient was diuresed oxygen requirement diminished and patient was transferred to floor on POD6 on supplemental oxygen via nasal canula and intermittent nebulizer treatments for shortness of breath/wheezing.
Patient with baseline COPD and patient received intermittent CXR's in addition to monitoring of vital signs to achieve adequate oxygen saturation.
GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until tolerating oral intake.
Patient's ACE inhibitor was held during admission secondary to increased creatinine.
Foley was maintained throughout admission and will be continued following discharge given sensitive fluid balance issues and need for urine output monitoring.
On POD4, patient was found to be positive for C diff and started on po vancomycin and IV flagyl.
Patient's number of bowel movements decreased on antibiotic therapy and he will be discharged to complete a 10 day course.
Endocrine: Patient was maintained on an insulin sliding scale and diabetic appropriate diet secondary to his DM2.
He will be followed by medical oncology and surgery for management of this issue.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.
At the time of discharge on POD#14, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating with assistance, with a foley in place, and pain was well controlled.
