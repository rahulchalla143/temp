History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 105462**] is a 77yo LH man with a PMHx significant for metastatic melanoma (mets to liver and lymph nodes), afib on coumadin, placement of a pacemaker and lumbar spinal stenosis who was originally admitted to neurosurg on [**11-12**] and transferred to OMed on [**11-15**].
He was intubated and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management (INR on arrival was 2.3).
He was observed and his anticoagulation was reversed while on that service.
A head CT with contrast on [**11-13**] was concerning for an intracerebral hemorrhage,      On the AM of [**11-15**], he was found to have decreased responsiveness -- he barely responsive to name, would have difficulty opening his eyes and and difficult to arouse.
Concerned, neuroonc was consulted and it was recommended that he be transferred to the NeuroICU for further management for concern for worsening of his bleed.
He was started on decadron and nimodipine.
He also received an extra dose of phenytoin (200mg) He also received a NCHCT prior to transfer, that was unchanged from the one the day prior.
Atrial fibrillation, status post pacemaker placement in [**2196**].
Status post partial thyroidectomy 15 years ago.
Status post total laminectomy of L4-L5, partial laminectomy of L3, fusion of L4-L5 in [**2187**].
Coordination: Weakness with finger-nose-finger, finger-to-nose, L>R.
At time of discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname 105462**] had a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status and his orientation could be good on one day and patchy on another, with an otherwise similar exam.

He was loaded with Dilantin, and his INR was immediately reversed with FFP and Vit K for a goal INR < 1.4.
He was extubated in the morning, and on his exam he was following commands and MAE.
He was medially stable overnight on the floor however was agitated and required Posey restraint and Geodon.
Intracerebral Hemorrhage Contributors: Likely cerebral metastases of melanoma (difficult to further evaluate in this context and given MRI could not be performed owing to pacer), coumadin, striking of head (possibly occurred after bleed - unclear).
[**Name2 (NI) **] should remain on Lovenox prophylaxis given lesser risk of more bleeding, but likely hypercoagulable state at present.
Please do not restart coumadin at this time.
His mental status worsened slightly with Dilantin, so we have started zonisamide and started tapering Dliantin (was at 150 mg TID) - see instructino in med list below.
Gabapentin has likely been anticonvulsant and was mistakenly continued at 300 mg TID rather than 600 mg TID, but this is now continued at the lower dose given stability at present and some sedation.
This should be revised after Dilantin is stopped and with continued evaluation of mental status.
Given steroid treatment, IV H2 blocker (now PPI on DC as per home regimen), insulin were started.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] plans whole brain radiation and chemotherapy is also possible.
Self-resolving but also treated with small Lasix doses (20 mg).
Vancomycin and Zosyn chosen given less likely to provoke seziures than other regimens.
PICC line was placed and is in the correct location for use.
Patient typically takes metoprolol succinate 25 mg QAM with additional 25 mg of tartrate if needed.
SSRI Citalopram dose held at 20 mg. Can be increased when patient stabilized to 40 mg if indicated, as intended by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Hypothyroidism Would recommend outpatient TSH check given interaction of levothyroxine with calcium.
Hyperlipidemia Continued atorvastatin at 10 mg.  Hematuria and Urinary Management Trace in context of Lovenox treatment and Foley in place.

We started Dilantin (an anti-seizure medication) and changed this to Zonegran given some sedation.
It is now safe for you to go to rehabilitation where you will complete a course of antibiotics and undergo physical therapy.
Please take your medications as directed and attend follow-up appointments.
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, or Ibuprofen etc.
Please do not restart warfarin at this time.
