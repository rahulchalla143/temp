Pt was given Lasix 10mg IV x 1 with thought that hypoxia would improve with diuresis, but clinical response was limited.
Given pt's initial improvement on antibiotics and high fever on presentation, antibiotic coverage was continued.
She was switched from Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin to Levofloxacin 750mg PO (initially q48 [**1-18**] decreased CrCl, now daily) as she started having a mild transaminitis, thought to be possibly secondary to the Ceftriaxone.
Hence, steroids were not continued beyond the Solumedrol 125mg IV x 1 dose in the ED.
She was continued on Albuterol/Ipratropium nebs.
HR responded favorably to fluid boluses.
Rate was much improved after IVF and po rate control (diltiazem).
First set of cardiac enzymes were negative, and was not cycled as rate may cause slight demand ischemia with elevation in CE's.
HR responded favorably to fluid boluses.
Excessive albuterol was avoided to prevent further tachycardia.
Coumadin was initially held due to guiaic positive stools, but as crits and vitals were stable, Coumadin was resumed on [**11-28**].
INR was uptrending, 1.7 at discharge, and will need to be followed with Coumadin dose adjusted accordingly to maintain INR [**1-19**].
She has a history of colonic polyps, and was actually due for an outpt colonscopy this week.
Pt initially also had hematuria, secondary to foley placement with resolved after foley removal.
Steroids were not contiued as pt was not particularly wheezy on exam, and pneumonia and pleural effusions were thought to be the likely etiology for her hypoxia given her fever, leukocytosis, and positive response to rate control.
It was thought that Ceftriaxone might be contributing, and it was discontinued, with LFTS trending downward.
Pt was continued on home Levothyroxine.
