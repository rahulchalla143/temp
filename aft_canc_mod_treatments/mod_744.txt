Because of these findings, he was started on anticoagulation for a week and was scheduled for an urgent radical nephrectomy and IVC thrombectomy.
PERTINENT X-RAYS, EKGS, AND OTHER TESTS:  CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a large right renal mass with invasion of the right renal vein extension through carotid fascia, extensive collateralization and deformation of the right psoas muscle, persistent pulmonary emboli on the left pulmonary artery, and sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
PROCEDURES PERFORMED:  A right radical nephrectomy with IVC thrombectomy.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed a right radical nephrectomy with IVC thrombectomy.
Patient, though, received 9 units of packed red blood cells during the course of the operation.
After the operation was over, patient was taken directly to the surgical intensive care unit where he remained intubated and under close observation.
On the morning of postop day 1, patient received 2 more units of packed red blood cells for postoperative anemia.
His chest tube was discontinued, and he was extubated both of which he tolerated well.
On postop day #2, patient was transfused 2 more units of packed red blood cells for, once again, a hematocrit of under 25.
On the morning of postop day #3, however, patient's O2 requirement had increased and he was saturating only 92% on a 4 liters of nasal cannula.
He was also started on Lovenox at a dose for treatment of known PE, but he remained stable with a hematocrit of 25.1.
For this reason, patient was started on an aggressive diuresis using Lasix IV and on postop day #4, his O2 was able to be weaned.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Right renal mass, bilateral pulmonary emboli, and metastatic right renal cancer, postoperative anemia status post multiple transfusions.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin 2 mg p.o.
daily, hydromorphone 2 mg take [**1-3**] p.o.
every [**2-4**] p.r.n., oxycodone 20 mg sustained release take 1 p.o.
