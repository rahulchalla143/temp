Brief Hospital Course: 79yF with history of hypothyroidism, hypertension, DLBCL in remission, and bronchial stent in left mainstem bronchus (for compressive lymphadenopathy), recent Pseudomonal pneumonia, c-Dif and admission for FUO, who presented for acute shortness of breath and required 3 day course in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for intubation/bronch times 2, and currently being treated for pseudomonal infection of airways with ceftaz and tobra.
Patient's exam, O2 requirement and very concerning radiography caused her to be admitted to intensive care unit, at where she underwent intubation and bronchoscopy (twice) to remove mucous plugging of left mainstem bronchus.
After her second bronchoscopy she was extubated and had good improvement in symptoms/signs.
Because of her history of pseudomonal pneumonia, she was empirically treated with ceftaz and when her sputum cultures grew pseudomonas, inhaled tobramycin was added to her antibiotic regimen.
She was also treated with a brief steroid course given concern for a reactive airway disease component to her presentation.
She was then transferred to regular care floor with decreased need for supplemental O2 (sat 96 % on room air at rest).
She was seen by infectious disease and had her antibiotic changed to IV tobramycin.
She was treated with nebulizers, chest PT, acapella treatment, and antibiotics with decrease in her decreas in her productive cough and decreased rhoncerous breath sounds.
She will complete a three week course of antibiotics at rehab.
Finished a prior to admission course of vanc during hospitalization.
Given reinitiation of antibiotics during this hospitalization, she was restarted on PO vancomycin with plans to continue for five days after completion of this new antibiotic course.
She has a h/o this condition so was continued diltiazem at with good control of her blood pressure.
#)Prophylaxis:  Patient was placed on prescribed bowel regimen and had solid stools while on regular floor.
Additionally, she received subcutaneous heparin to prevent DVTs.
