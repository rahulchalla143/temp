He started chemotherapy shortly thereafter, and reports feeling malaise shortly after his chemotherapy sessions, the most recent of which was on Friday [**8-15**].
He also reports measuring a low blood pressure at home to 85/61 (baseline in the 110s systolic) though was asymptomatic.
He was in Afib with RVR and was started on a ditliazem drip at 10mg/hr.
He was given vancomycin and cefepime and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
A CTA was negative for PE and showed numerous lung and liver lesion and an air-filled strucutre at the anterior border of the liver that could represent gallbladder with pneumobilia, bowel, or a necrotic lesion.
His Afib with RVR broke with the diltiazem gtt and he was given tylenol 1g for pain.

There is an ill-defined hypodense mass centered in the region of the pancreatic head/uncinate process, measuring approximately 3.1 x 2.7 cm.
A duodenal stent is in place.
These findings have not significantly changed since the earlier study of [**2183-8-18**] but are better characterized on this study given the abdominal coverage today.
Right PICC tip is difficult to visualize can be followed to the mid to lower SVC.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism although with suboptimal opacification of distal vessels.
[**8-18**] RUQ ULTRASOUND 1.
Predominantly hypoechoic structure with internal echoes and containing air.
This cannot be connected to bowel and may represent distended gallbladder with sludge and pneumobilia; however noting limited assessment, stomach or bowel, or potentially a necrosis lesion are difficult to exclude.
If more definitive characterization is needed clinically, CT abdomen may be obtained, preferably with intravenous contrast is possible.
He was started on cipro 400mg IV q12h and flagyl 500mg IV q8h for empIric coverage for potential intra-abdominal infection.
He was discharged on cipro 400mg IV q12h and flagyl 500mg IV q8h with a planned 4 week course ([**Date range (1) 112302**]).
Day 1 of antibiotics was [**8-19**].
Pending culture results, the proposed antibiotic plan was to obtain repeat imaging upon discharge from [**Hospital1 2436**] to ensure that the fluid collection was being drained adequately, to continue IV antibiotics for 2 weeks (last day of IV abx [**9-2**]), to reimage the abdomen, and then to potentially transition to PO antibiotics for the last two weeks of his 4 week course (ending [**9-16**]).
He returned to Afib with RVR on the floor that reverted to NSR with diltiazem gtt at 15mg/hr.
He was given his home lantus 25 units QHS and placed on an insulin sliding scale.

You should continue to take this medication at home.
In addition to your usual evening long-acting insulin dose, you were placed on a short-acting insulin sliding scale.
Change the dressing around the biliary drain daily.
The percutaneous drain should be flushed daily according to the following instructions: Flush with 10cc sterile saline and aspirate back.
In this case, please call [**Hospital1 18**] operator ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2756**]) and ask for [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with the radiology nurse practitioner's office for further instructions.
Troubleshooting: If catheter stops draining suddenly: 1) Check that the stopcock is open.
If there is, then firmly flush 5 cc of sterile saline into the catheter.
