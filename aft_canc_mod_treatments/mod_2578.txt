[**1-27**] level SMA embolization with 2 wires and particles for UGI bleed into distal duodenum/prox jejunum   History of Present Illness: DIAGNOSIS:  33-year-old gentleman with relapsed transformed B cell lymphoma status post autologous stem cell transplant on [**2155-3-31**], with disease recurrence in 07/[**2155**].
He also had retroperitoneal right ileum and left inguinal lymphadenopathy.
The nodular architecture was effaced by vaguely nodular proliferation of small cleaved cells with a mass of larger centroblastic cells (10 to 15 per high power field).
Focally, the follicles were composed of sheaths of larger centroblastic cells consistent with transformation to a high- grade lymphoma.
He was then treated with six cycles of CHOP and Rituxan.
Given the patient's transformed phenotype, he was treated with cytoreduction and MIME chemotherapy followed by consolidation with high dose chemotherapy and stem cell rescue.
He then proceeded with MIME chemotherapy x two cycles.
He tolerated this well and demonstrated evidence of response as determined by decrease in the size of mediastinal lesion and decrease in the intensity of PET uptake.
The patient subsequently underwent high-dose cytoxan for stem cell mobilization.
He was admitted for transplant and preconditioning chemotherapy high-dose cytoxan, followed by bone marrow transplant.
He had an autologous stem cell transplant on [**2155-3-31**].
He was treated with Zevalin on [**2155-11-18**].
At that time he got 4 more doses of Rituxan chemotherapy, followed by [**Hospital1 **].
He then received ESHAP chemotherapy on [**2156-6-18**], which he tolerated well.
The patient then got a nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant with Campath conditioning.
More recently, he received lymphocyte infusions in late [**2157-1-25**].
Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] was recently admitted on [**2157-3-25**] with an upper respiratory infection manifested by coryza, cough, and nasal congestion with fevers to 101 and also associated with a diffuse macular body rash.
Iron stain:  Moderate iron deposition, predominantly in Kupffer cells.

During hospital admission, pt's liver enzymes continued to rise.
Based on the clinical picture of rash and rising LFTs in combination with the timing after DLI, acute GVH was very high on the differential so cellcept was increased to 1gm [**Hospital1 **] and solumedrol continued.
Given the pt's worsening GVH, pt had a [**Hospital1 **] line placed and photopheresis was initiated.
prednisone and subsequently prednisolone ([**1-26**] concern that prodrug was not being metabolized).
Bilirubin continued to trend up.
On [**4-21**], patient was changed back to solumedrol (increased dose as well), w/subsequent decrease in bilirubin (hepatic enzymes stable).
However, then bili started to trend upwards again and peaked at 30.
Photopheresis was postponed during periods of his GI bleeding (see below).
Once his GI bleeding had been controlled, it was decided to attempt to taper his tacrolimus and monitor his LFTs, as his LFT elevation could actually be partly from tacrolimus toxicity.
He continued to get biweekly photopheresis with his LFT's and bilirubin trending downward at discharge.
He was treated with amicar po 2gm q2 hours as well protonix IV q12 and sucralfate.
He was also supported with many, many blood transfusions.
Foscarnet had been decreased to daily dosing after 2 weeks, but since this medication was presumed to have made the ulcers much better he was changed back to q12 dosing.
A tagged red cell scan was positive, however, so he underwent interventional angio procedure which confirmed active extravasation in the proximal jejunum.
Hemostasis was unfortunately unable to be achieved with epinephrine injections and hemoclips, and he therefore went back to angio and was aggressively embolized by IR on [**5-27**].
Subsequently the patient's hematocrit continued to trend down and he received a total of 10 units of PRBCs during his MICU stay.
Extensive discussions occurred between IR, surgery, [**Month/Day (4) 3242**], and the MICU team regarding possible surgical intervention, however it was ultimately decided to take a conservative stance and observe.
He was continued on aminocaproic acid and his Hct remained stable.
He required occasional transfusions but these Hct drops were not felt ot be due to bleeding.
3) Fever/malaise: The theory of a upper respiratory infection in the setting of acute GVH was continued from the previous admission.
However, intra-GI tract pathology was c/w HSV and possible CMV infection and the pt was treated with Foscarnet at high doses for over 3 weeks.
They recommended artifical tears and ointment for symptomatic relief.
Pt was initially treated with nystatin swish and swallow and oral amphotericin but given the severity, fluconazole was added.
He improved symptomatically, but on [**5-13**] began to have more lesions c/w thrush and was started on ambisome as well as continuing with the nystatin swish and swallow.
Foscarnet was switched to acyclovir at the time of discharge.
They recommended obtaining PFTs and using Advair for symptomatic relief.
Advair was held while the patient was on systemic steroids and with thrush.
His cough improved significantly after being treated with high-dose foscarnet for 2 weeks.
8) Line infection: Pt had an episode of hypotension to 80/50 on [**4-17**], responded to 500cc NS bolus x2, and 20mg solumedrol.
Given h/o coag neg staph positive from line that was sensitive to vanco he was started on vancomycin.
Concern for infectious vs adrenal insuff and failure of prednisone to be converted by liver (on solumedrol until [**4-15**]).
He completed a 14 day course of vancomycin (finished vanco on [**2157-4-30**]).
Pt was treated with zosyn empirically for a 14 day course, and symptoms improved.
10) NHL: s/p mini-MUD allo-[**Date Range 3242**] and donor lymphocyte infusion.
He was tolerating PO's well and TPN was discontinued.
When his foscarnet was stopped the headaches initially went away and then when it was restarted the headaches returned.
He was empirically started on ambisome for fungal infection and bactrim for toxoplasmosis.
Immunoperoxidase studies show much of the increased intraparenchymal cellularity immunoreacts with the T-lymphocyte antibody CD3.
