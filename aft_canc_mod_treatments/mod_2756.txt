Skin, left 2nd finger, biopsy (B):     Interstitial neutrophilic and granulomatous inflammation, see note and comment.
The differential diagnosis includes a palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis which may be observed with a number of underlying systemic disorders including as a paraneoplastic process which may be associated with leukemias and lymphomas and as a reaction pattern associated with various autoimmune disorders, in particular rheumatoid arthritis, and less likely sarcoidosis.
[**10-20**]: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY DIAGNOSIS:      Erythroid dominant myelodysplastic marrow with excess blasts.
Respiratory-type mucosa and fibrovascular tissue with mild chronic inflammation and surface epithelial degenerative changes.
Tiny 9 mm fluid collection with possible rim enhancement anterior to the left sternocleidomastoid muscle may be at the site of prior central line insertion and could represent a superficial abscess.
PICC line noted within these vessels.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 56872**] is an 82 year old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis recently hospitalized with hypoxemic respiratory failure, at which time she was diagnosed with pulmonary histioplasmosis and myelodysplastic syndrome (RAEB-2), who presented on [**2124-10-13**] with fevers and left sided neck pain, found to have idiopathic granulomatous disease, hospital course complicated by 1 episode severe epistaxis.
She was originally admitted to the floor, transferred to the ICU for respiratory decompensation, out to the floor on the BMT service once stabilized, back to the ICU for epistaxis requiring 4U PRBC transfusion and nasal balloon placement, then to the BMT service for further workup.
Multiple potential sources of fever were identified and treatment without improvement in fevers, as follows: .
She was started empirically on Vancomycin and Cefepime.
She underwent successful incision and drainage.
#UTI Infectious work-up revealed Vancomycin resistant/Daptomycin senstive UTI.
?s h/o ulcerative colitis, rash, previous biopsies showing granulomatous disease in the skin and bone marrow, and persistence of fever despite appropriate antibiotic treatment of multiple infections, as above.
Lack of definitive infectious source or clinical improvement despite broad antimicrobial coverage, there was increasing concern for a rheumatologic source of fevers.
She was started on steroids with good improvement in overall well-being, diarrhea, and fevers.
Discharge with plan to follow-up with rheumatology for further medical management.
?s syndrome, deep fungal infection or atypical mycobacterial infection; these were treated with 2 weeks of topical steroids with good effect.
PNA identified on CXR was treated with antibiotics with good resolution of symptoms and successful extubation.
ENT packed the L nares lesion at 1 AM w cautery and advised avoidance of NC O2 administration.
IV team placed additional peripheral for total of 2 x 22g, 1 x 20g PIV.
She received 1L NS at 200cc/hr and 2u pRBC total.
Bleeding subsided with packing in place and she remained hemodynamically stable, with stable HCT.
She was also discharged with a few doses augmentin, to complete a 5-day course of antibiotics started when nasal balloons were removed and dissolvable packing was placed.
#LEFT ARM PICC-ASSOCIATED DVT PICC placed [**10-31**]; patient developed pain and swelling in her left arm overnight that night - doppler ultrasound showed DVT, which was seen to have been present (but smaller) on imaging earlier during this admission.
No anticoagulation was given for this line-associated clot given concominant severe epistaxis.
Diarrhea did improve when she was started on steroids for systemic granulomatous disease, suggesting inflammatory diarrhea.
*Hx HISTOPLASMOSIS INTERMEDIATE-POSITIVE URINE ANTIGEN Pt carried a diagnosis of histoplasmosis from previous admission for which she was being treated with voriconazole.
Her beta glucan and galactomanan levels were WNL and voriconazole level was therapeutic.
Despite MRSC negative for PSC rheumatology felt symptoms and labs could be consistent with biliary inflammation below the level of detection of imaging.
She required multiple blood transfusions to maintain Hct >21.
She was continued on prophylactic acyclovir and started on prophylactic bactrim given steroid aministration.
She was on acyclovir 400 mg q8h prior to their appearance and was continue on this antiviral treatment throughout admission.
Steroid taper to be managed by Rheumatology 2.
