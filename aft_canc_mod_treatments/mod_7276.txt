BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DVT STUDY:  Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed.
Her work-up revealed a 13x8cm mass in mediastinum with pericardial infiltration, SVD compression and bilateral pleural effusion.
Furthermore, the patient was diagnosed with a left subclavian thrombosis and was started on a heparin drip.
The patient tolerated the chemotherapy well, never developing signs of tumor lysis, so we were able to give rituxan on day 5.
Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 105351**] developed some tachycardia and O2-desaturation to 88% after the rate of rituxan was increased to 150mg/h, but after reducing the rate to 100mg/ml and supportive therapy she improved rapidly and received the whole dose of rituxan (375mg/m2).
Upon therapy, left pleural effusions as well as left atelectasis improved on chest Xray.
On [**2175-9-6**] we pulled the femoral line and switched the heparin drip to Lovenox (1.5mg/kg per q24h).
