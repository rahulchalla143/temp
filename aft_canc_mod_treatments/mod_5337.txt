Chest x-ray [**2135-5-18**]- 1) New left chest tube does not lie within small apical pneumothorax.
The major clot burden is on the right side and the patent areas between the popliteal and femoral bifurcation may represent evacuated areas following pulmonary embolus.
NON-HEMOLYTIC) STREPTOCOCCUS.
Brief Hospital Course: 46 y/o M with a PMHx of metastatic squamous cell CA s/p WBXRT and palliative XRT of L/S spine admitted with respiratory distress due to hemo/pneumothorax.
Two chest tubes were placed.
Oxygen need continued to decline and the apical chest tube was removed on HD#2.
Thoracics surgery decided to performe a Doxycycline pleurodeisis through his chest tube to prevent further accumulation of his hydro/PTX.
Subsequently the second chest tube was removed.
This likely represented a breakthrough clot despite anticoagulation and was most likely due to his cancer.
