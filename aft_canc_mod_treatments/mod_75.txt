With neurology consulting, he was started empirically on keppra for seizure prevention as his presentation was most consistent with a post-ictal state although EEG did not show seizure activity.
He was negative X 3 for c.diff but as he had been on long-term antibiotics and had low-grade fevers/inc WBC count, he was started empirically on flagyl for a 7 day course and his diarrhea and fevers resolved.
