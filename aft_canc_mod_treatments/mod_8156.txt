His Coumadin had been held since [**4-11**] and heparin was started on admission.
Tamponade with Foley balloon transiently seized bleeding, however, repeat attempt at anticoagulation led to a repeat bleed with a drop in his hematocrit of 44 to 34, he became hypotensive requiring 3 units of red blood cells, 1 unit of fresh frozen platelets, vitamin K and repeat placement of Foley and the rectum for tamponade of bleeding.
There was no visible vessel noted, however, given that this was site was in the site of the source of bleeding it was injected with epinephrine and cauterized.
At that time he was hemodynamically stable and had a stable hematocrit for 72 hours on heparin and Coumadin.
Status post left hip replacement in [**2138**].
Mechanical aortic valve replacement in [**2134**] due to bicuspid aortic valve.

and he was restarted on his Coumadin as well as his heparin.
He was also placed on stool softeners.
Gastrointestinal was consulted and he actually had a rectal Foley placed transiently again for several hours, which stopped the bleeding.
His Coumadin was held at this time.
Two days later his Coumadin was restarted and he was without any further bleeding.
He was restarted on his Coumadin on [**4-27**], originally with a dose of 5 mg q.h.s., which was subsequently increased to 7.5 mg q.h.s.
Cardiovascular:  The patient has a history of hypertension controlled on Hydrochlorothiazide and Moexapril.
At the time of his gastrointestinal bleed and hypertension these medications were held.
He also has a history of mechanical aortic valve replacement secondary to a bicuspid aortic valve.
He was admitted for prostate biopsy and a screening colonoscopy due to the need for anticoagulation with heparin while holding Coumadin.
He was discharged on Coumadin 7.5 mg q.h.s.
It soon resolved after receiving intravenous fluids and transfusion of red cells.
Hematologic:  As mentioned above after his lower gastrointestinal bleed he received a total of 3 units of red blood cells, one unit of fresh frozen platelets and vitamin K on admission.
He was anticoagulated with heparin and intermittently received Coumadin, however, at the time of discharge he was on Coumadin 7.5 mg q.h.s.
