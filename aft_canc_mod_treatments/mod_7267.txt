It appeared that he began to show signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal in the ED with increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate.
He also spiked a temprature and became short of breath.
Since there was concern for PE, infectious process, COPD, vs. EtOH withdrawl in the ED, was treated with valium (10 mg IV once), solumedrol, nebs, magnesium, levo/flagyl/ceftriaxone (2gx1) and vanc.
The following day, the ceftriaxone and vancomycin were discontinued because there was a very low suspicion for meningitis in this patient.
Given his altered mental status on admission, there was some concern for aspiration so he was continued on levofloxacin.
He was also continued on a very short prednisone taper for the possibility of COPD exacerbation given wheezes on exam.
