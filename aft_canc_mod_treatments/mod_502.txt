He was treated with Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers and placed on Flovent and started on a rapid steroid taper.
Although the patient's symptoms seem to improve with inhalers and steroids after discharge he noted a one week worsening shortness of breath upon exertion, worsening hoarseness and orthopnea.
Concurrently the patient's Lasix dose was changed to 20 mg po q.d.
Given the significant narrowing of the airway the patient was started on Decadron and Ceftriaxone and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for monitoring of airway.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the MICU for observation overnight while placed on humidfied air, 10 mg of Decadron and Ceftriaxone.
He would be started on Heliox and likely intubated.
If intubation were required fiberoptic assistance would be likely needed.
The patient was started on CPAP at night in order to prevent soft tissue collapse and was placed on cool nebs throughout the day.
For preparation of the procedure the patient's Coumadin was held and he was started on a heparin drip.
The patient was also evaluated by cardiology and with echocardiogram to rule out any valvular abnormalities or significant atrial thrombus secondary to atrial fibrillation.
The plan was for the patient to continue Carvedilol at 6.25 mg b.i.d., Aldactone, Lasix and Digoxin.
He was rate controlled with beta blockade and Digoxin.
Ultimately on [**2170-1-10**] the procedure was performed after the patient's INR was satisfactory.
Following the procedure the patient was given 12 mg of intraoperative Decadron and an endotracheal tube was placed secondary to narrow airway.
Following the procedure the Ceftriaxone which discontinued as it was used as a prophylactic medication for any possible laryngeal infection.
Following the biopsy it was known that the edema was more consistent with tumor and therefore the Ceftriaxone was discontinued.
Dexamethasone was continued as was Albuterol and Atrovent and the patient's intubation.
The possibility for tracheostomy following the extubation or any time in the future was discussed with the patient and the family, but was not felt to be necessary during this hospital stay.
Given the patient's airway has remained stable for several days he was evaluated by physical therapy and felt to be an excellent rehab candidate.
The plan is for the patient to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3311**] for a possible chemotherapy versus radiation next week.
It is possible still that the patient may require tracheostomy during his cancer treatment.
The patient was restarted on heparin and his Coumadin dose was increased to 5 mg po q.h.s.
