HPI: Pt is a 79yo male h/o of aortic stenosis (asymptomatic) and recently discovered adenocarcinoma of the colon (by colonoscopy in [**1-4**]) presenting for aortic valvuloplasty and pre-op L heart cath for resection of adenoCA of mid-ascending colon on Tuesday AM by Dr.[**Name (NI) 1482**] service.
4.25 baseline, 4.15 s/p intervention; CI 2.14, 2.12 s/p intervention.
Hemodynamics showed baseline mean aortic valve gradient ~35mm Hg with calculated [**Location (un) 109**] 0.69cm2.
After interventon (balloon valvuloplasty, mean aortic valve gradient reduced to 30mmHg wtih calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.8cm2.

-Zenkers diverticulum s/p surgical repair by [**Last Name (un) 6520**] [**4-3**] -h/o splenomegaly and thrombocytosis -Anemia iron deficiency--baseline 31-32% -Bilateral inguinal hernia repair 35 years ago as well as repair  of a right inguinal hernia in [**2146**] -Decreased hearing -Esophageal stenosis diagnosed several years ago at the [**Hospital1 **], but chose not to undergo surgical procedure.
Baseline trans aortic gradient was measured at mean of 35mmHG corresponding with [**Location (un) 109**] of .69cm2.
Aortic valvuloplasty was performed using a 20 x 60 mm balloon and a 22 x 50 mm balloon.
Following balloon valvuloplasty, the aortic valve gradient decreased to 30 mmHg with a calculated valve area of 0.8 cm2.
Critical Aortic stenosis at baseline which improved slightly after valvuloplasty 3.

S/P "moderately successfull" valvuloplasty with increasing [**Location (un) 109**] and slightly improved hemodynamics.
no coronary interventions were made.
-continue ASA -no need for plavix since no intervention -consider starting statin after the colorectal surgery Pump: EF decreased on recent echo from 50% to 30-40% (pre-valvuloplasty).
-cont to monitor tele, mostly in 1st degree AV block -hold BB, nodal agents -atropine at bedside if symptomatic bradycardia -if degenerateds into Mobitz I type II, call EP for consideration of pacemaker placement .
Pt scheduled for resection tomorrow AM by Dr.[**Name (NI) 1482**] service.
-NPO after MN for surgery .
-will hold iron supplements .

On [**2151-3-9**] the patient underwent a laproscopic right colectomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (please see operative note for details).
On POD 0, the patient spiked a temperature of 102.4, which was determined to be from atelectasis as his wounds looked and chest X-ray looked good.
Vancomycin, gentamycin and flagyl were started empirically because of his recent valvuloplasty.
On POD 1, he required 1.5 liters in fluid boluses for hypotension (SBP in the 70's to 80's).
Amiodarone was started at 200 mg PO TID.
Consideration was given to heparinize the patient, however cardiology did not feel the need to do so given that he responded well to the amiodarone and cardioversion and did not experience any more atrial fibrillation.
Gentamycin was discontinued.
On POD 2, he continued to require fluid boluses to keep his SBP above 90.
Antibiotics were discontinued as he was afebrile with a normal WBC.
Medications on Admission: Meds: aspirin 325 mg po daily, protonix 40 mg po daily, senna one [**Hospital1 **] prn, tylenol prn, colace 100 mg po bid, iron.
