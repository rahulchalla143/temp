She had worsening respiratory distress with continued hypoxia, which required intubation and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
She required extremely high PEEPs up to the mid 20s to adequately oxygenate her.
The patient slowly improved and was able to transition to pressure support ventilation and eventually extubated about four weeks off intubation without any problems.
Infectious disease:  The patient had a complicated course of antibiotics with multiple side effects.
Toward the middle of her Intensive Care Unit course she developed a ventilator associated pneumonia and grew Enterobacter cloacae, which was gram sensitive and was being treated with Gentamycin.
She is currently on Vancomycin for gram positive cocci bacteremia and Gentamycin for Enterobacter cloacae __________ associated pneumonia.
Vitamin insufficiency:  Upon arrival to Intensive Care Unit the patient failed cord stim test and was therefore started on Hydrocortisone for seven days.
The decision was made to continue steroids until she clinical improves and given that she is now doing much better she will have the steroids weaned.
She required pressors for about two to three weeks, but those subsequently weaned off without any difficulty.
This was believed to be secondary to stress reaction, leukemoid reaction and oral steroid doses.
