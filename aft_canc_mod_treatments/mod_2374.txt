HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of non-small cell lung cancer of the left lower lobe diagnosed in [**2131-1-26**] status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy for locally advanced disease, and status post radiation treatment for brain metastases, who is admitted for pneumonia and failure to thrive with decreased oral intake and weakness which has worsened over the prior two to three weeks.
She was admitted and treated for a urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and volume depletion.
On admission, she was found to have worsening hypertension with shortness of breath that was not improved with a saline bolus and with Lasix.
The patient had a pericardiocentesis with a drain placement that removed 500 cc of fluid and an additional 200 cc to 300 cc of fluid at the bedside.
The echocardiogram after pericardial drainage showed the effusion was resolved.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient's pericardial effusion was initially resolved with a drain placement and reaccumulated.
In addition, a drain was placed in the pleural space to drain bilateral pleural effusions.
Drainage of the pericardial space slowly declined, and the pericardial drain was eventually removed without problems.
Digoxin 0.125 mg was given for this as the patient's high liver function tests prevented amiodarone, and the patient's hypotension prevented the use of calcium channel blocker and beta blockers.
The patient had pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions for which a pleural drain was placed.
The patient had episodes of oxygen desaturations to the middle 80s on room air and was maintained on 15 liters face mask at 96% and eventually was able to be weaned down to was 2 liters nasal cannula with oxygen saturations in the low 90s.
At the time of this Discharge Summary, the pleural drain continued to be in place, but the plan was to remove upon discharge.
The patient's pneumonia on admission was treated with levofloxacin 250 mg q.d.
The patient was found to have low platelets and a positive screen for heparin antibody.
After discontinuation of heparin flushes, the thrombocytopenia resolved.
Vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets were given with success to improve coagulation.
Neurologically, the patient worsened after the placement of the second pericardial drain and remained intermittently lucid and disoriented.
After a discussion with the patient and the family regarding placement of a nasogastric tube and/or a gastrojejunostomy tube for nutritional supplementation, it was decided that based on the patient's poor prognosis that these options were not appropriate.
Finally, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay was complicated by hypercalcemia which was treated with moderate success with intravenous normal saline and intravenous Lasix.
Fentanyl patch 25 mcg per hour q.72h.
Scopolamine patch 1.5 mg every three days as needed for nausea.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg to 2 mg p.o.
Levsin 0.125 mg to 2.5 mg q.4-6h.
Morphine concentrate 5 mg to 20 mg q.1-2h.
Lasix 40 mg intravenously q.d.
