Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ordered a MRI and the Cardiac team is waiting for the results to assist in assessing the bleeding risk of the metastases and to determine whether or not he was a surgical candidate for coronary vascularization.
He was examined by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of Cardiology, who assessed his MRI results and allowed Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] to proceed with bypass surgery.
On [**12-2**], the patient underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting x1 with a mediastinal lymph node dissection upon the discovery of enlarged nodes when his chest was open, and the patient also had intra-aortic balloon pump placed in the operating room for hemodynamic instability.
The single bypass was a saphenous vein graft to the LAD.
He is transferred to Cardiac ICU in stable condition on a nitroglycerin drip at 0.5 mcg/kg/minute and titrated propofol.
On postoperative day two, the patient was doing fairly well, had to restart his Neo-Synephrine over the prior evening due to some hypotension.
He was in sinus rhythm in the 90s with a blood pressure of 98/55 at the time of exam, and in the morning was on a Neo-Synephrine drip at 1 mcg/kg/minute.
He was satting 93% on 2 liters nasal cannula.

He was also seen by Neurosurgery, who recommended continuing his IV decadron and Dilantin, and patient was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] about the possibility of having surgery to remove the metastatic lesion in his brain, which was discussed with the patient.
His Lopressor was increased to 100 t.i.d.
His Foley was pulled with continuing good output and he was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2, where he was evaluated by a physical therapist, and he was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2 on the [**12-9**].
