Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Exploratory laparotomy, supracervical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, sigmoid resection with rectal anastamosis, repair of cystotomy and tumor debulking.
Past Medical History: Significant for adenoid cystic carcinoma of the right jaw, status post maxillectomy and radiation therapy in [**2137**].
ALLERGIES TO MEDICATIONS:  Penicillin and fentanyl.
OB HISTORY:  Vaginal delivery x2.
[**2141-7-19**] Surgical pathology: 1.
Uterus, right fallopian tube and ovary, hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy (A-H):      A.  Carcinoma in myometrium and para-metrial soft tissue, present at inked parametrial soft tissue margin.
Ovary and fallopian tube, left, salpingo-oophorectomy (I-N):      A.  Papillary serous carcinoma, ovary.
Rectosigmoid colon, resection (V-AA):      A.  Carcinoma in bowel mesentery.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 7611**] was admitted after undergoing an exploratory laparotomy, supracervical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, sigmoid resection with rectal anastomosis, repair of cystotomy and tumor debulking for a pelvic mass previously visualized on CT.
Prior to her surgery, an epidural was placed by anesthesia for post-operative pain management.
Her post-operative course was complicated by hypotension, right ventricular hypokinesis, NSTEMI, a-fib, anemia and oxygen desaturation.
She was admitted to the ICU on post-op day four for management of post-operative a-fib.
Her SBP was maintained > 90 with aggressive fluid management.
A statin, BB, and ASA were started for risk factor modification per cardiology.
reportedly has h/o post op a. fib after her surgery in [**2137**] which responded well to Lopressor and was self limited.
Rate responded poorly to IV and PO metoprolol on the floor, but improved control after second dose of diltiazem (15mg IV on the floor, 20mg IV in the ICU), approximately 100 down from 140s on transfer with rate ~110s-120s on diltiazem 5mg/hr gtt.
She was loaded with amiodarone on [**7-23**] and cardioverted to NSR on [**7-24**] at noon.
At this point the diltiazem drip was discontinued and she was started on PO lopressor.
She was started on Lovenox for thromboembolic prophylaxis.
An attempt to transition her to Coumadin was abandoned after her INR was noted to be 4.7 after three days of Coumadin at 5mg qd.
She was given vitamin K, her HCT was monitored serially, and there was no evidence of acute bleeding as her INR returned to baseline.
Bridging to Coumadin may be re-attempted as an outpatient once her nutritional status improves.
No evidence of left ventricular wall motion abnormalities nor depressed EF to suggest significant risk for pulmonary edema, but has been receiving fluids for BP maintenance given RV wall motion abnormalities and mild bibasilar crackles were heard on exam .
Responded well to 20mg IV Lasix during ICU course with good response (neg.
1700cc) which resulted in improved pulmonary function and oxygenation at 99% on 2L.
# Proph: Lovenox  Pt was transferred out of the ICU on POD8 and did well on the floor, maintaining her O2 sats well on room air, ambulating, and tolerating a regular diet.
