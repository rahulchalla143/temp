History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 10321**] is a 50 year old male with grade 1 pilocytic astrocytoma s/p recent suboccipital carniotomy brought to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 **] center due to tachycardia and dyspnea noted by rehab radiology faculty.
His post-cramotomy ([**11-18**]) course was complicated by repeat craniotomy ([**11-24**]) for re-bleeding and residual mass as well as by RLL pneumonia (completed 7 day course on Levofloxacin).
He was discharged to rehab on dilantin ppx and DVT prophylaxis (heparin 5000 U SC TID, originally written on [**11-18**] on initial admit).
Following d/c from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-30**] and prior to this admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 10321**] reports minimal ambulation and activity (without HA, nausea, vomiting, or palpitations) with severe R calf pain and dyspnea while getting physical therapy at rehab that morning.
Bilateral DVT's were discovered on ultrasound ([**12-5**]) and Mr. [**Known lastname 10321**] was transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
He was evaluated by his neurosurgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who recommended starting heparin at 1000 units/hour without bolus and repeating a head CT once the patient was therapeutic (PTT 50-70).
He had an IVC filter placed by the vascular team through a right IJ approach.
Physical exam was notable for reduced lung sounds at the bases bilaterally (L>R) with inspiratory wheezes and mild crackles appreciated at the mid right throax and lower left lung base respectively.

The patient developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with heparin therapy.
Pulmonary emboli: Massive bilateral pulmonary emoboli initially treated with heparin gtt and IVC filter placement.
Coumadin was started when platelet count rose to above 150.
There was a greater than expected response to coumadin after two doses of 5 mg daily, leading to INR 16.
The patient was started on coumadin 2 mg daily [**2118-12-14**], with INR 3.5 on discharge.
Thrombocytopenia: Positive heparin dependent antibodies.
The patient's platelets improved with discontinuation of heparin products and use of argatroban.
THIS PATIENT SHOULD NOT RECEIVE ANY HEPARIN PRODUCTS EVER AGAIN (this includes flushes and subQ heparin).

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pulmonary embolus Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia  Secondary: pilocytic astrocytome s/p craniotomy R corneal abrasion R facial palsy + dysarthia   Discharge Condition: Medically stable for transfer to rehab.
Prior to admission to the medical service, while on the ICU service, an IVC filter was placed by vascular surgery following ultrasound evidence of bilateral deep venous thrombi in your legs which were the source of the clot travelling to the lungs.
Anticoagulation was initiated on [**12-5**] in the MICU and was continued upon transfer to the medical floor.
The cause of the clots was likely a reaction to heparin called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
Phenytoin was discontinued and Keppra was started according to the neurosurgeon's recommendations.
Anti-heparin/PF4 antibody screen was positive consistent with a diagnosis of Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT).
Heparin was discontinued and argatroban was initiated.
Serial PT/PTT/INRs were measured and coumadin was added [**12-9**] as per protocol.
During your admission, physical therapy worked with you to continue your rehab schedule with good success in helping you to ambulate with a walker.
Consequently, they recommended thick liquid and soft solid diets as well as turning your head to the right while swallowing during meals.
You are being discharged back to the rehab facility to continue with your post-operative care and rehabilitation.
The following were the changes to your medications: Coumadin was started with an INR goal of 2.5-3.5 Dilantin changed to Keppra 1000 mg PO BID Acetaminophen not to exceede 3g/day in setting of daily coumadin.
Please take all medications as prescribed.
A sheet is attached with all the medications you should be taking.
