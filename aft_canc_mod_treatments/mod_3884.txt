History of Present Illness: 60 y/o F with mantle-cell lymphoma s/p RCHOP (4 cycles), s/p R-[**Hospital1 **] (2 cycles), and s/p RICE (Day 1 on [**2118-6-29**]) who was seen in clinic on [**2118-8-29**].
She continues to put a gauze and bacitracin to the area on her labia and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] baths three times a day.
However prior to transfer she developed acute respiratory distress with stridor requiring 100mg of iv solumedrol and o2 therapy.

The patient received XRT and two doses of gemcitabine during her hospitalization, however her pericardial effusion reaccumulated with consolidation and the patient was transitioned to comfort care.
Her allopurinol was discontinued on [**9-10**] and her atovaquone was stopped per her request due to intolerance of the taste and she was switched to PCP prophylaxis with [**Name9 (PRE) 57308**].
She remained pancytopenic during her hospitalization and required multiple platelet and PRBC transfusions.
She was treated with Gemzar again on [**9-13**].
Her dilt was held due to hypotension and her HR slowly came up to the 140's to 160's.
A discussion was had with her, and then with her and her family about her prognosis: the inability to drain her pericardial effusion and the fact that her lymphoma was not responding well to the chemotherapy.
It was explained to her that there were no more chemotherapeutic agents which were likely to induce remission and that a bone marrow transplant at this time would have a very low likelihood of inducing remission while exposing her to toxicity from the chemotherapy.
Patient was stabalized overnight and underwent a thorocentesis by the procedure team the next morning.
Fluid was sent for cytology and cultures, and a pericardial drain was placed.
Patient subsequently also developed bilateral pleural effusions, a pleurex drain was placed on the left for extended drainage and a thoracentesis was done on the right for 1.9L of fluids.
Her shortness resolved over time and she was weaned off oxygen on the BMT floor.
She had a CXR on [**9-11**] done due to increasing cough which showed reaccumulation of her pleural effusions so she had a pleurex drain placed by IP on [**9-12**] for drainage.
The cardiologist who read the echo did not feel that it could be drained percutaneously and that an invasive surgery would be needed for decompression eventually.
However, patient acutely rose into 170's with decrease in SBP to 60's, Metoprolol was pushed and rate was controlled with resultant hemodynamic stability.
Boluses of IV Metoprolol and diltiazem only breifly reduced HR.
Patient eventually required a diltiazem drip to control HR and BP was closely monitored as it dipped to the 80/40 range, but patient was mentating well with good UOP.
By day 2 in the MICU, the patient was weaned off gtt and converted to PO diltiazem without further episodes of SVT.
Hypotension: Patient with pressures occasionally in the 80/40 range while on diltiazem gtt, but patient was asymptomatic with good UOP.
BP was controlled with gentle fluid boluses as patient had multiple thoraceneces to remove fluid in the CCU.
On [**9-12**] and [**9-13**] she had a few episodes of hypotension in response to pain medications which responded to IVF boluses.
She continued to become hypotensive, likely due to the reaccumulation of her pericardial effusion and was supported by fluid boluses.

Fluid was removed and drainage tubes were placed on your right and left sides.
You underwent radiation therapy for your lymphoma and received two doses of chemotherapy.
There was also radiographic evidence of rapid regrowth of lymphoma, and after discussion with the patient, her husband and sons it was decided that patient will have no further chemotherapy or radiation and will have comfort measures and hospice arranged at home.
You will be on nystatin for thrush (the white coating in the mouth) treatment as needed, ativan prn for anxiety or insomnia, morphine and oxycodone as needed for pain, morphine as need for respiratory distress, omeprazole for GERD, compazine as needed for nausea, and albuterol inhaler as needed for shortness of breath.
You can also take colace [**Hospital1 **] and senna prn for constipation.
