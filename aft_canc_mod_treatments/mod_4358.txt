Admission Date:  [**2128-1-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-4-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2074-10-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine-Iodine Containing / Optiray 320  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: Admission for MUD allo-SCT  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar punctures Central line placement Stem cell transplant  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 53-year-old woman with a history of high-risk AML who is being admitted today for her matched unrelated allogeneic transplant.
The plan is to move forward with an allogeneic transplant from an unrelated donor.
The donor would be able to collect stem cells, but we could not guarantee a backup bone marrow should her stem cell collections not be adequate, so the decision was made to cryo-preserve the stem cells and Mrs.[**Known lastname 87521**] admission was delayed until today.
She is admitted today for her allogeniec transplant with Busulfan and Cytoxan conditioning.
Hernia repair at time of C-section in [**2114**] with steel mesh placed; patient CANNOT have MRI with abdomen in scanner.
DISCHARGE LABS: ................................................................ MICROBIOLOGY: [**2128-1-20**] Urine Cx: Coagulase negative Staph [**2128-1-27**] Urine Cx: Coagulase negative Staph [**2128-3-13**] Urine Cx: Coagulase negative Staph [**2128-4-29**] 6:15 pm BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary): BURKHOLDERIA (PSEUDOMONAS) CEPACIA.
PATHOLOGY: [**2128-2-12**] Right Leg Skin Biopsy: Vacuolar interface and mild superficial perivascular dermatitis with epidermal and follicular dyskeratosis.
[**2128-3-16**] Left Flank Skin Biopsy: The sections show focal/patchy parakeratosis with "squamous cell activation," multifocal dyskeratosis, and mild spongiosis.
The dermal-epidermal junction is involved by marked vacuolar changes, and apoptotic and colloid bodies are present.
GVHD may show subepidermal blisters and dysmaturation, however, the degree of intraepidermal vesicles would be unusual for GVHD alone and this finding favors a component of a viral infection.
Resolution of previously noted sigmoid diverticulitis.
Prior cholecystectomy with no focal liver lesion or evidence of biliary obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 53 year old woman with AML who was admitted on [**2128-1-14**] for matched unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplant with Busulfan/Cytoxan conditioning.
She was given a total of 17 liters of fluid overnight as well as 4 units of PRBCs and maximum BP support with 4 pressors maxed out (neo, levo, vasopressin, and epinephrine) and despite these measures her pressures remained in the 60s-80s systolic.
She was intubated for respiratory distress.
After withdrawal of pressors and extubation, she passed peacefully within a few minutes.
# AML and MUD allo-SCT graft issues: Patient received an MUD allo SCT on [**2128-1-22**].
After reaching ANC of 0, she was engrafting well until around 25-30 days s/p transplant when her ANCs began to drop.
Foscarnet was started for HHV-6, the cyclosporine was discontinued, and steroids were increased, and ANCs started rising again.
She developed skin GVHD, so she was started on a low dose of tacrolimus, uptitrated to therapeutic doses with subsequent downtitration of her steroids.
She was given pentamidine for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**] (unable to give Bactrim considering [**Last Name (un) **]).
Prednisone was tapered as well.
She was treated with a cycle of MEC followed by Donor Lymphocyte Infusion.
Infectious disease was consulted and her antibiotics were changed multiple times and included aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole IV, vancomycin IV and PO, and micafungin.
Due to concern for nephrotoxicity and after being afebrile for a prolonged period of time, her antibiotics were gradually discontinued, with the exception fungal prophylaxis.
After MEC therapy (in peri-DLI period) she again developed febrile neutropenia.
She was started on cefepime after which she defervesced.
She was then noted to  have a VRE UTI and daptomycin was started.
A biopsy of her left leg on [**2-12**] was suggestive of GVHD so she was started on systemic and topical steroids.
The rash initially improved, but again worsened despite steroids and there was concern that it was virally mediated considering her HHV-6 viremia.
The skin GVHD was managed with IV and then PO steroid as well as topical clobetasol.
Her skin worsened again, so tacrolimus and prednisone were weaned out of concern for worsening viral infection, perhaps [**3-10**] [**Location (un) **] or HHV-6.
However, after DLI her rash acutely worsened and became quite weepy with several areas of skin breakdown and the sensation of an acute burn, suggesting a GVH picture.
She was treated with various medications including benadryl, hydroxyzine, and olanzapine with some improvement in her symptoms.
The [**Last Name (un) **] resolved with discontinuation of these medications and resolution of TTP-HUS.
An osmotic diuresis due to elevated glucose may have also been contributing to this hypernatremia, so aggressive control of glucose was made a priority with the addition of Lantus and an ISS.
# Hypertension: With only metoprolol on board, she developed HTN in the setting of thrombocytopenia.
Nifedipine was added and the cyclosporine was discontinued, and her BP was well controlled.
Considering her numerous antibiotics, she was started on PO vancomycin which was later changed to prophylactic dosing.
The diarrhea eventually resolved and the po vancomycin was discontinued.
# Nutrition: Patient struggled with nausea throughout the entire admission and initally had poor PO intake, so she was started on TPN on [**2128-2-1**] which was eventually stopped when she was able to tolerate PO intake.
