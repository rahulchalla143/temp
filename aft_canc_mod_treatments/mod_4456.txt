Since admission, initially to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was started on leukophoresis x3 on [**3-11**], hydrea, 3 days of Idarubicin and 7 days of [**Month/Year (2) **]-C, and required CVVH for renal failure with subsequent improvement in creatinine.
Course was complicated by tumor lysis syndrome which improved with CVVH, allpurinol, plasmapheresis.
His counts recovered though this was complicated by neutropenic fever and was started on vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl and micafungin with resolutions of fevers.
He was switched from micafungin to voirconazole (and briefly ambisome).
His course was also complicated by a PICC-line associated DVT in R brachiocephalic subclavian vein, initially treated with heparin gtt and then lovenox with factor Xa level titration.
He has had persistent anemia, thrombocytopenia treated with intermittent prbcs and plts prn.
His digoxin had been discontinued due to fluctuated renal funtion and his metoprolol had been uptitrated for HR control as he is chronically in atrial fibrillation.
He additionally has hypocalcemia after treatment of hypercalcemia 2.2 tumor lysis and was followed by endocrinology who recommended discharge with Vit D and calcium carbonate.
He had been doing well with plans for discharge home on the morning of transfer.
He then received 2 units of blood overnight and his repeat HCT was 24.1.
He was also started on a protonix drip.
Past Medical History: -afib, s/p "watchman procedure"-experimental procedure to block of atrial appendage, therefore not on coumadin -hyperlipidemia -htn, well controlled on metoprolol -prostate cancer, s/p radiation  Social History: He is a retired [**University/College **] professor of political science, recently moved back from CA after teaching at [**University/College 33150**] to be closer to his children.

Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY 78 y/o Political Theorist with PMH of Atrial Fibrillation s/p Watchman procedure presents with M5-AML Blast Crisis and Leukostasis.
# AML M5 Type, Leukostasis with Leukemic Infiltration of Lungs, Kidneys, s/p Leukopheresis x 3 # Tumor Lysis, s/p Rasburicase # Acute Renal Failure, "Blast-Casts" in urine, s/p CVVH # Leukopoenia, s/p 3 then 7 ([**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]-C) # One Atypical Cell in CSF, s/p IT Chemotherapy (5/5,[**3-28**] and [**4-9**])  Originally presenting to his PCP with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] sore throat and diagnosed with strep throat (at which time he had a normal CBC), his symptoms progressed to include dyspnea and olgiuria.
On [**3-11**], he was started on leukopheresis and received three sessions.
He was also started on rasburicase with good effect.
On [**3-12**], he was also started on CVVH concommitantly with 3 days of Idarubicin, which restarted his tumor lysis.
On [**3-17**], CVVH was discontinued, the patient was transferred to the floor and completed a full course 7 days of [**Month/Year (2) **]-C. His CSF showed an atypical cell and thus received three rounds of IT chemo (2xMTX and 1xAraC).
# Neutropenic fever # VRE Sepsis # [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Sepsis # Aspergillus Lung Disease, Angioinvasive # Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome # Enterobacter Aerogenes UTI  Pt developed neutropenic fever and was started on cefepime, vancomycin, flagyl and micafungin during the course of his hospitalization, with initial resolution of his fevers.
At this time he was switched from micafungin to voriconazole (and briefly Ambisome).
He is to finish a 4 week course of linezolid and voriconazole on [**5-7**].
# DVT   Patient developed a provoked, PICC-line associated DVT in his Right Brachiocephalic-Subclavian vein that was treated out of concern that it was an infected clot, first with heparin gtt then with Xa-factor titrated doses of LMWH.
He did have an abnormal US on [**4-7**] with gallbladder sludge and and mild intrahepatic bile duct dilatation.
His statin was held for now but may be restarted as an outpatient if his LFTs normalize.
# Hematuria: initially resolved with foley removal, however then recurred later in the course of the hospitalization in the setting of low platelets.
Pt was seen by urology who recommended monitoring given pt not a candidate for cystoscopy given low plts, outpt f/u.
# [**Name (NI) **]  pt seen by dermatology who biopsied the lesions on his legs.
The patient was transfused supportively as needed with both red cells and platelets.
# Atrial Fib s/p Watchman Procedure  chronically in AF.
He required uptitration of metoprolol for rate control.
He should restart his digoxin as an outpatient if his renal function remains stable.
He was given given multiple intermittant doses of lasix during his stay.
He was supplement with calcium and vitamin D.  Per endo, he should be dc'd on calcium carb 1000 [**Hospital1 **]-TID, ergocalciferol 50K q wk x12 wks, cholecalciferol 1000 q d then recheck in 12 wks.
He was given one dose of 50K units of ergocalciferol while in house.
He recieved a total of 5 units of packet red blood cells.
He remained stable on a [**Hospital1 **] protonix and tolerated a normal diet.
He is told to avoid all anticoagulation (including lovenox/coumadin for his DVT), aspirin, and NSAIDs.
