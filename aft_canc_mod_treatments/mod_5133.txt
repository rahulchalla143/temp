Admission Date:  [**2160-3-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-5-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-3-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Heparin Agents / Motrin / Phenobarbital / Vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2927**] Chief Complaint: Altered Mental Status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: This is a 68 yo woman with a history of Large B cell Lymphoma, s/p SCT [**2158**], complicated by intra-parenchymal and SDH and subsequent seizures with baseline aphasia who presents with confusion and worsening gait.
Of note she has had multiple admissions for the same symptoms and recent admission [**Date range (1) 69952**] for altered mental status (worsening gait, aphasia) of unclear etiology though seemed to improve with antibiotics (though no clear infection).
She does have a chronically trapped left ventricle so neurosurgery was consulted regarding semi-elective stereotactic drainage of her chronically trapped left ventricle when all infectious issues resolved.
Regarding infection she had c.diff neg x2, WBC on UA but culture negative (was treated with ceftazidime transitioned to cefixime for discharge-[**Date range (1) 69953**] for 10 day course).
She was also treated briefly with levofloxacin starting on admit [**2-29**] for cough, but returned + for influenza B.
Patient was given ativan 1mg iv x2 for agitation with good effect, though on previous admit had paradoxical rxn to ativan and responded well to haldol.
Neurology consulted and recommended Ativan with the possibility that she may have been seizing.
High-grade large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed [**10-14**].
She was treated with 6 cycles of R-CHOP [**2157-11-2**] through [**2158-1-17**].
Supportive care with Neulasta and Aranesp given.
Anutologous stem cell transplant with BEAM chemotherapy was done in [**2158-3-9**].
Intra-parenchymal hemorrhage and sub-dural hematoma s/p evacuation x 4 following fall.
Suprarenal IVC filter placed on [**2158-2-10**] (large infrarenal IVC clot and thrombosis of left common iliac and left femoral veins seen at that time) 6.
Staphylococcus hand infection treated with incision and drainage and subsequent antibiotics 8.
Tonsillectomy 13.
Cholecystectomy [**65**].
Excision of a benign abdominal tumor 15.
Physical Exam: Gen: Elderly woman in NAD, lying in bed with eyes closed HEENT: NC/AT, mm slightly dry, sclera anicteric, OP clear without ulcerations, exudates, or erythema Neck: supple, no LAD or elevated JVP CV: RRR, no murmurs, rubs, gallops, nl S1, S2 Resp: scant rales in left base, no wheezes or rhonchi, unlabored breathing Abd: soft NT/ND, no HSM, bowel sound present Back: no CVAT Extrem: no cyanosis, clubbing, edema, + hammer toes Skin: large right shoulder/back ecchymosis, abrasions and ecchymosis over both knees, no other rashes Neuro: drowsy, mumbling with some coherant words and sentences, does follow motor commands (but does not open her eyes); CN II-XII intact, PERRLA, motor: nl bulk and tone, strength 5/5 UE (shoulder abduction, adduction, elbow felx/ext, wrist ext, grip), LE (hip flex, knee flex/ext, dorsiplantar flex/ext) bilaterally, sensation intact to light touch bilaterally, DTR's 2+ biceps, triceps, bracioradialis, 1+ patellar, toes downgoing bilaterally.
Altered mental status: admitted to ICU for monitoring after episode of somnolence which improved with Ativan administration.
During ICU course, had brief periods of calling out initially, but at transfer, no further episodes of agitation or somnolence for hours.
Continued on keppra, lamotrigine and gabapentin  4.
lamotrigine was increased on [**2160-3-27**] 300mg twice a day.
Patient started on ciprofloxacin, linezolid and piperacillin-Tazobactam.
The agitation periods were sparse and less PRN Haldol was required.
On [**2160-4-2**] Neurontin was discontinued and Lyrica was started with the goal of better seizure/epileptiform activity control.
EEG leads were placed on [**2160-4-9**] and IV Depakote was given.
Depakote 500mg standing dose was initiated on [**2160-4-10**], and lamotrigine was decrease to [**1-11**] dose 150mg [**Hospital1 **] (from 300mg [**Hospital1 **])  MICU Course: On [**2160-4-10**] the medical intensive care unit team was called to the bedside for an episode of unresponsiveness.
It occurred while she was on continuous EEG monitoring and there was no seizure activity present.
She had only a PICC line in place so additional peripheral access was obtained and she received two liters of normal saline boluses.
She transiently required peripheral dopamine while IV access was being obtained prior to MICU transfer.
On [**2160-4-13**] metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] was restarted due to persistent elevated blood pressure and sustained heart rate of 120beats/min.
On [**2160-4-17**] she developed fever, somnolence and diarrhea.
She received IV flagyl for 7 days with improvement in her mental status before transition to po vancomycin w/ planned 14 day course ([**2079-4-23**]).
She had a relative decrease in her BP and metoprolol was stopped and during recovery again titrated for elevated SBP.
In the setting of c. dif she was found to have some subclinical seizure activity on EEG while off lyrica and lamotrigine due to inability to take po.
She was put back on keppra with vitamin B6 to help with any adverse effects on mood with plan to wean off depakote but she developed severe agitation and would either scream or cry when staff entered the room and had some violent behavior.
Patient refused her PO medications and lab draws occasionally.
No anticoagulation was pursued given her history of intracranial hemorrage.
Family meeting with her long term and current care providers was recommended.
Plan of care and long term goals were discussed at the meeting.
Midline catheter remains in place for comfort medications.
