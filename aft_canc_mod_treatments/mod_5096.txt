History of Present Illness:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. [**Known lastname 64713**] is a 63 year-old female with a history of CAD status post MI in [**10/2118**], status post stents X3 (last on [**2119-4-14**]) currently on ASA and Plavix, atrial fibrillation no longer on Coumadin given a history of life-threatening lower GI bleed in [**11/2118**] (at which time Coumadin was discontinued and Plavix was initiated), also with CHF and PVD, who presents from home with a 1-day history of "dark stools".
Of note, she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**11/2118**] with a lower GI bleed while on Coumadin and ASA.
At that time, endoscopy was remarkable for EGD with mild gastritis (negative H. pylori), and C-scope with multiple diverticula and polyps, with a blood clot seen at the hepatic flexure with diverticula and polyps underneath without active bleeding.
A tagged RBC scan was positive for tracer uptake at the hepatic flexure, but an angiogram was negative, and an intervention was not performed.
ASA and Plavix were subsequently restarted.
She was given Protonix 40 mg IV X1.
Past Medical History: --LGIB: Admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**2118-12-1**] with massive LGIB while on coumadin and plavix after NSTEMI and A.fib.

--ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Developed PAF during admission for NSTEMI [**10-31**] converted to sinus rhythm with beta blocker, anticoagulated with coumadin s/p massive LGIB.
--ANEMIA [**2118-12-12**] Hemolytic Anemia - unclear etiology after extensive inpatient w/up.

Unfortunately, due to her recent stent placement, her ASA and Plavix had to be continued.
GI was consulted who recommended transfusions as needed, and prep for c-scope.
Gen [**Doctor First Name **] had been consulted to assist with possible surgical intervention, but given lack of localization, it was felt that short of performing a total colectomy, it would be prudent to wait for the next bleeding episode to decide on which portion of the colon to remove.
Pt was continued on her anticoagulation medications.
Pt was started on a diltiazem drip and beta blocker for rate control.
At the time of discharge, pt's HR was adequately maintained in the 80s on PO Toprol and PO diltiazem.
Pt was restarted on clears [**5-26**] and her diet was gradually advanced to a regular diet.
TPN was discontinued [**5-28**].
Wet to dry dressings three times a day were done to treat the wound infection.
On discharge, pt had WBC of 10.2 and wound was no longer draining and had granulation tissue  Medications on Admission:  MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: ASA 325 mg PO QD Plavix 75 mg PO QD Percocet prn Norvasc 10 mg PO QD Sertraline 25 mg PO QD Imdur 60 mg PO QD Ambien prn Lipitor 80 mg PO QD Toprol 100 mg PO QD HCTZ 25 mg PO QD   Discharge Medications: 1.
