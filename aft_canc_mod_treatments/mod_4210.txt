He underwent a right nephrectomy on [**2150-5-15**].
He underwent attempted resection of that nodule on [**2150-8-4**] complicated by V-fib arrest during anesthesia induction which required resuscitation.
He was referred here and high-dose IL-2 therapy was discussed.
Cardiology cleared him for treatment off Lopressor.
One month post CyberKnife MRI was stable.
He began cycle II, week 1 high-dose IL-2 therapy on [**2151-5-17**], receiving 12 of 14 doses with course complicated by hypotension requiring Neo-Synephrine, blood pressure support and neurotoxicity.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Atrial fibrillation; chronic renal insufficiency; BPH; Bell's palsy bilaterally; gout; right inguinal hernia repair in [**2141**]; heel spur; metastatic kidney cancer as above.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 84751**] was admitted and went to Interventional Radiology for central line placement.
He received 3 fluid boluses with systolic blood pressure over 90 and improved mental status.
He was placed on Neo-Synephrine vasopressor support.
Continuous blood pressure bedside and central telemetry monitoring were instituted.
On treatment day #5 he received his fifth dose of IL-2 at 8:00 a.m. and later that day developed rapid atrial fibrillation to the 200's with systolic blood pressure of 60 despite Neo-Synephrine blood pressure support.
He was given IV digoxin without response.
Given continued hypotension and rapid atrial fibrillation, he was transferred to the ICU where he was treated with IV metoprolol and he converted to sinus rhythm in a short time.
He was weaned off Neo-Synephrine blood pressure support early the next day.
Other side-effects during this week included nausea, improved with antiemetics; diarrhea, improved with antidiarrheals and bilateral shoulder pain, improved with oxycodone.
Further IL-2 therapy was on hold due to shock at that time.
He had associated oliguria and metabolic acidosis, improved with bicarbonate replacement intravenously.
IV fluids were continued given evidence of acute renal failure.
He was anemic without the need for packed red blood cell transfusion.
