Bone marrow biopsy  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 2031**] is a 62 y/o male with MM s/p allo-BMT and DLI [**8-16**] with GVHD of skin recently admitted on [**10-14**] for [**Month/Day/Year **] and shortness of breath concerning for pneumonia or restrictive airway disease such as BOOP.
Since discharge, he was on levaquin, which was subsequently switched to azithromycin by his outpatient oncologist.
He does note continued post-nasal drip and [**Month/Day/Year **] productive of white sputum.
Multiple myeloma - s/p MUD nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplant [**7-16**] with Campath conditioning.
Past treatment modalities include: s/p auto PBSCT in [**2188**],DC vaccine, Thalidomide, Velcade/Doxil, Cytoxan/Doxil.
He has most recently been treated with radiation therapy and velcade in preparation for this DLI treatment.
His [**2191**] transplant was complicated by mucositis with HSV infection, c. diff and enterococcus bacteremia.
HSV has been resistant to oral valtrex and acyclovir but has improved with IV foscarnet, which was most recently restarted on [**2191-11-30**].
Recent hospital amission for prophylactic rod placement in L femur with XRT (discharged6/24/06), also with recent radiation to his right clavicle and right calf as well.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 2031**] is a 62 year-old male with multiple myeloma status post allo-BMT and donor lymphocyte infusion [**8-16**] with GVHD of skin, who was admitted for dyspnea.
He was initially started on vancomycin, levaquin, cefepime and caspofungin.
Antibiotics were changed to ceftazidime, voriconazole and ambisome.
During the patient's course he had an episode of desaturation to the low 80s on 2L NC O2.
His oxygen was increased to 5L NC, but he continued to be tachypneic and oxygenation ranged from 88%-98% on 5L.
He was treated with 40 IV lasix and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxic respiratory distress secondary to aspergillus and pseudomonal pneumonia.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient's prednisone was decreased from 60 mg to 15 mg QD.
His antibiotics were adjusted ultimately to caspofungin and voriconazole for aspergillus, meropenam for pseudomonas, and atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
He was still occasionally using a face mask at night, but this was more for humidification.
There was some suggestion of occasional fluid overload and he noted that his SOB felt better after diuresis.
He required occasional diuresis with lasix.
The patient never required intubation and his respiratory status improved with antibiotics and diuresis.
Once stable, he was transferred out of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], on [**4-15**] L O2 via nasal cannula, meropenem for pseudomonas and voraconazole and caspofungin for aspergillus.
On the floor the patient remained stable, but still requiring 4-5 L of NC and on one occassion 7L face mask.
He remained on nebs and advair for symptom improvement.
Was diuresed for a fluid goal of -500 cc/day He continued treatment with caspofungin and voriconazole for aspergillus, meropenem for coverage of pseudomonas and atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
A repeat CT scan was more worrisome for BOOP so the patient was treated with cellcept and steroids.
He improved slightly, but later decompensated and went from 4L NC to face mask and later non-rebreather.
To maximize his treatement at this point he was started on doxycycline for atypicals, given stress dose steroids (for BOOP/GVHD), given meropenum (pseudomonas), vancomycin (pneumonia coverage), primaquine (PCP) and clindamycin (pcp).
Patient remained on NRB, and then continued to decline and was only 70-80% saturation on 100% NRB, the patient was DNR/DNI and continued to decline at this point with antibiotics, lasix, nebs and inhalers.
At this point he was started on a morphine drip for  comfort.
Afterwards, he was placed on NPO and then thick liquid diet.
Skin GVHD grade 4: The patient has a diffuse rash from skin GVHD and receiving prednisone for this.
Given the increased risk for infection, prednisone was again decreased to 15 QD.
Around that time the patient was also started on cellcept to improve his GVHD.
This was decreased, and while his pulmonary status worsened, the oral steroids and topical steroids helped the patient's skin GVHD.
He was started on oral cedofovir and continued pain control with magic mouthwash.
His course has been complicated by skin GVHD and mucositis.
His counts were closely followed and he was given blood for hematocrit < 25 and platelets for platelets < 30.
His bony lesions were treated with fentanyl patch and oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
His pain was controlled with fentanyl patch and oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
At this time his insulin was stopped, but as his steroids were increased he was restarted on SSI, and his insulin was adjusted as needed.
He never required intervention and as his was post-ablation, given his poor pulmonary status and risk for increased pulmonary fibrosis his amiodorone was stopped per infectious disease and pulmonary recommendations.
Hypertension: The patient was continued on his metoprolol.
His bumax was stopped in the ICU for borderline low blood pressure.
He had urine cultures followed, and as he was not infected was given platelets as needed and medications to control bladder spasms.
Dispo: The patient expired on [**2193-1-2**] on morphine drip.
