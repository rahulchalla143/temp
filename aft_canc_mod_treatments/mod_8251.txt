lung abscess  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Flexible bronchoscopy, right thoracotomy, decortication, open lung biopsy, intercostal muscle flap, pericardial window and biopsy, mediastinal lymph node sampling.
He underwent a pigtail catheter placement into the pleural space, as well as a pigtail catheter placed into a lung abscess in attempts to allow this infection to resolve.

COMPARISON: There are no prior CT exams or radiographs for comparison.
An RV pacemaker and aortic valve prosthesis are present.
A right PICC terminates in the SVC.
Several notable findings are seen in the soft tissues, including a right thyroid nodule measuring 3.3 x 2.8 cm.
Cardiomegaly, mitral annulus and coronary artery calcifications, enlarged ascending aorta, aortic valve replacement, and probably pulmonary hypertension.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 77 year old man with right pleural fluid collection REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: place pigtail catheter in right pleural abcess.
PROCEDURE: After explaining potential risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure to the [**Hospital 228**] healthcare proxy, verbal consent was obtained.
A qualified nurse was present to administer 1 mg of Versed and 50 mcg of fentanyl over 30 minutes, with continuous monitoring.
A small loculated right hydropneumothorax is again noted, perhaps slightly increased in size, with a posterior pigtail catheter in stable position.
Pacemaker leads, sternotomy wires, extensive coronary artery and mitral annular calcifications are seen in addition to an aortic valve prosthesis.
Using CT guidance and trocar technique, a 10 French catheter was inserted directly into the collection and approximately 35 cc of purulent hemorrhagic fluid was aspirated, a portion of which was sent to microbiology.
The pigtail was then formed and the catheter was secured to the skin.
Patient status post CT-guided 10 French catheter placement into a right middle lobe fluid collection without immediate complication.
Chest tubes were placed and the patient was taken to the recovery room.
Over the next several days, he was extubated and chest tubes were sequentially removed.
