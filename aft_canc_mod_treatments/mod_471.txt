Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52-year-old female with ALL s/p chemo and single cord blood transplantation complicated by CMV viremia, streptococcal bacteremia, VRE UTI, and suspected GVHD-induced hepatitis who presents with fever and productive cough.
She was started on azithromycin and advised to return to clinic in 3 days.
She was started on vancomycin and aztreonam, in addition to continuing her current azithromycin.
Cannot perform ROS as pt is intubated and sedated.
Fluid non-diagnostic but as high suspicion for CSF disease started on twice weekly methotrexate ---[**2113-12-28**]: CSF sample from confirmed CNS involvement of ALL ---[**2115-1-1**] CSF sample from  was negative for ALL so IT MTX discontinued - [**2114-1-17**]: Part B hyperCVAD of cycle 1 was started (IT chemo was limited to D6 ara-C on [**2114-1-22**] to minimize neurotoxicity) - [**2114-2-2**]: Cycle 2 (Part A) of hyperCVAD started - [**2114-3-5**]: Cycle 2 (Part B) hyperCVAD chemotherapy started - [**2114-4-5**]: IT MTX administered  OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY ============================ - Latent tuberculosis: PPD with 12mm of induration in [**2111**] at [**Hospital1 2177**] after which received [**1-26**] mos of INH discontinued due to transaminitis, she has been on moxifloxacin suppression since starting chemotherapy -Hypertension -Hyperlipidemia -Diabetes Mellitus (not on medications) -Vitamin D deficiency - Hepatitis B Ab positive (core +), maintained on lamuvidine   Social History: She is Mandarin-speaking only and immigrated from [**Country 651**] in [**2100**].
Physical Exam: GENERAL: Intubated, initially responsive to verbal stimuli, but sedation increased for agitation.
ETT in place.
Placed on ARDS-NET protocol.
Nasopharyngeal aspirate for influenza was negative, and flu cultures were negative.
BAL was negative for PCP; there was some concern that inhaled pentamidine could make a BAL appear falsely negative and diagnosis could require a tissue biopsy, but the beta-glucan was also negative, which was reassuring for rule out of PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient had been started empirically on treatment doses of bactrim for PCP until the first beta-glucan returned negative.
Since her LFTs were beginning to rise, bactrim was discontinued, as she has a history of elevated LFTs in the setting of this medication.
She was often desynchronous with the ventilator, often over-breathing the ventilator on volume control but not able to tolerate pressure control or pressure support ventilation modalities intitially.
Eventually, she was able to tolerate AC settings with increased sedation, and only brief trials on pressure support with less sedation.
On [**11-25**], the patient was switched to Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV).
The patient was placed on a RotaProne bed.
On [**11-28**], the patient was switched to Triadyne II bed and was continued on APRV.
Nitric oxide was used as well with some modest improvement in oxygenation.
The patient desatted to low 70s/high 60s with IV bolus.
The patient was repositioned patient on left side and noticed decreased breath sounds on left in new position.
Adjusted ventilator settings and started nitric oxide with no improvement in oxygenation.
Chest tube was immediately placed with vital signs improved immediately upon chest tube placement.
The patient was started on IV PPI and was given multiple blood products including pRBCs and FFP.
The patient's oxygenation worsened, and she continued to desat on FIO2 of 100% and maximum nitric oxide.
Given clinical deterioration, extensive discussion was held with the patient's husband and family about goals of care and a decision was made about no further escalation in care, including no blood products or lab draws.
Levophed was weaned down [**11-11**] and vasopressin was stopped [**11-13**].
She was started empirically on broad antibiotic coverage with vancomycin, aztreonam, and azithromycin.
On admission, she was empirically started on PCP treatment doses of bactrim and stress dose steroids with IV hydrocortisone.
She was also empirically started on oseltamivir for flu coverage which was discontinued on the fifth day of treatment due to a negative flu culture.
Once the beta-glucan was negative, the treatment doses of bactrim for PCP were discontinued; prophylactic doses re-started on [**11-18**] per BMT recommendations.
Patient was fluid overloaded after initial fluid resusciation.
She was given IVFs and albumin intermittently.
After vasopressin was stopped, she was diuresed on a lasix drip with successful output.
On [**11-24**], an inverse correlation between fever curves and Bactrim use was found and Bactrim was re-started again.
Metropenem was discontinued on [**11-29**] per ID recs.
During her lasix drip administration, the patient developed a metabolic contraction alkalosis.
She was started on acetazolamide.
#Ileus: Due to the high dose of fentanyl patient received, it appeared she developed an ileus.
# ALL: On chronic immunosuppression s/p single cord blood transplantation.
She was continued on acyclovir for prophylaxis, and her tacrolimus was discontinued.
She was started on stress dose steroids of hydrocortisone 100mg IV Q8hours; when the stress dose steroids were tapered down slowly, the patient seemed to make less progress with her respiratory status, so her steroid dose was increased back.
# Hep B: The patient was continued on lamivudine.
