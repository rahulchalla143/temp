Laboratory data was notable for an increase in her transaminases and alkaline phosphatase.
Her Tbili was at baseline, her lactate was 1.7, and she did not have a leukocytosis.
A CT abdomen and pelvis showed proper stent placement with biliarly ductal dilation, and incidental cecal thickening.
Renal and cardiology were asked to see the patient first thing in the AM prior to this for HD and evaluation.
She was given 4.5g of unasyn and 1g of tylenol.
Per [**2185-11-3**] note from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the patient has decided to not proceed with chemotherapy and concentrate on quality of life.
AVNRT: Managed with beta blocker therapy only per cardiology consultation given poor prognosis of other co-morbidities.
Consider Infectious          Disease consultation for serious infections caused by          ESBL-producing species.
The aorta is unfolded with aortic knob calcifications again demonstrated.
Known mass in the head of the pancreas is suboptimally evaluated in the absence of IV contrast.
Stent in expected location of the distal common bile duct is probably patent, given presence of pneumobilia.
CHEST RADIOGRAPH ([**2185-11-9**]): In comparison with the study of [**11-6**], there has been placement of a right subclavian PICC line that extends to the lower portion of the SVC.
Did not appear jaundiced and bilirubin was elevated but below baseline.
Patient reportedly received Unasyn in emergency department; antibiotic regimen was changed to ciprofloxacin and Flagyl given reported history of allergy to penicillins in past.
Sensitivities revealed E coli sensitive to only Zosyn; further antibiotic sensitivities are pending.
Given history of pencillin allergy (anaphylaxis) in [**2174**] and unclear history regarding whether patient has received penicillins since that time, patient was transferred to MICU for pencillin desensitization.
Zosyn desensitization was completed in MICU with decreased beta-blocker dosing (beta-blockers lower threshold for anaphylaxis reaction).
On readmission to medicine floor, antibiotic regimen was changed to meropenem given identification of E coli as an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producer.
Patient tolerated therapy well.
PICC line was placed on [**2185-11-10**].
Antibiotic course to continue for total 14 days.
Pancreatic cancer, stage 4:  The patient is no longer a surgical candidate, nor would she benefit from chemotherapy, and has decided not to go forward with aggressive management.

You underwent ERCP, a procedure to visualize that stent that was placed in your bile duct; this area was cleaned.
You also received IV antibiotics; this required a brief stay in the ICU to allow you to take penicillins given that you have a pencillin allergy.
You had a PICC line placed to allow for a total 14 day course of IV antibiotics.
Your medication regimen has changed.
Changes include: - Adding diltiazem (by mouth), a medication to help control your heart rhythm - Adding meropenem (by IV), an antibiotic - Stopping amlodipine - Taking metoprolol at a different dose three times daily rather than at the current dose once daily.
