Brief Hospital Course: 67 year old man with h/o HTN, CRI admitted with persistent nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and acute on chronic renal failure.
1) Chronic diarrhea: Infectious etiologies were thoroughly investigated.
MRI enterogram was without evidence of inflammation of the ileum, and MRA of the abdomen showed only a small celiac dissection (see below).
2) Anemia - iron deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency: The patient's hematocrit gradually trended down to a nadir 21.5 (26 at discharge).
As mentioned above, EGD and colonoscopy did not show source of bleeding, although iron studies were consistent with iron deficiency.
He declined blood transfusion and was started on iron supplementation.
Given low vitamin B12 level, the patient received 1 week of daily IM vitamin B12 injections; he should have one IM injection weekly for 1 month, followed by monthly injections as an outpatient.
3) Acute on chronic renal failure: With hydration, the patient's creatinine gradually trended down from 4 on admission, indicating likely pre-renal etiology in the setting of diarrhea/poor PO intake.
4) h/o DVT: The patient was restarted on Coumadin after his colonoscopy/upper endoscopy and was transitioned with a heparin drip until he was therapeutic at 2.3 on discharge.
He was continued on a Humalog sliding scale  7) HTN: The patient's Lasix and Diovan were held throughout his hospital stay, given his acute renal failure.
The vascular surgery service was consulted, who felt it was likely chronic and recommended outpatient follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
