Brief Hospital Course: 65M h/o multiple myeloma, amyloid, s/p autologous stem cell transplant [**2149**], on HD for renal failure with hemoptysis admitted on [**2151-2-15**] and discharged on [**2151-2-20**].
# Diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage: Patient has DAH as seen on both CT as well as on bronchoscopy with non-clearing vials even after wash.
He was continued on continuous mandatory ventilation and was weaned off as his oxygenation improved (extubated on [**2-17**]).
Per his primary oncologist, patient was started on oseltamivir and levofloxacin for empiric coverage of infectious etiologies.
He was ruled out for flu and oseltamivir was d/c-ed.
Ultimately etiology of DAH was unclear but was attributed to receiving heparin in the setting of strain.
Steroids were not started in this patient as his clinical course improved without intervention.
He was discharged with levofloxacin to last him for a total 7-day course until his follow up appointment with his primary oncologist.
During initial session experienced some ectopy with ventricular bigeminy, aflutter, and afib intermittently during dialysis.
He was started on metoprolol for control of this rhythm, but this was ultimately d/c-ed when he returned to sinus rhythm after completion of his dialysis session.
He had no further issue with his dialysis.
Patient is not a good candidate for heparin gtt secondary to known DAH.
# Myeloma: SPEP and UPEP as well as kappa and lambda light chains were sent which showed increased activity of his myeloma.
# Restless Leg Syndrome: Patient was recently started on a pramipexole.
# Depression: Continued citalopram and home temazepam as needed for insomnia.
# HTN: Initially held antihypertensives given DAH, but as patient stabilized, restarted home valsartan 160 mg [**Hospital1 **], nifedepine XL 60 mg [**Hospital1 **], Doxazosin 2 mg.  His nifedepine was uptitrated to 90 mg [**Hospital1 **], and he was informed of the change and advised to have his blood pressure monitored closely on this new dose.
# Genital Herpes: Continued home acyclovir 400 mg daily.
