hemorrhage and cerebellar mass   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation for MRI due to severe claustrophobia [**2180-4-6**] R Suboccipital Crani for Mass Resection [**2180-4-14**]   History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname **] is 66 y/o male with HTN, CAD and PAD.
Past Medical History: CAD, PAD, has had right iliac artery stent and right coronary artery stent   Social History: Former smoker 60 pack year hx stopped in [**2171**].
Recommend endoscopy for further evaluation.
Followup in three months is recommended.
MRI L-spine with and without contrast [**2180-4-6**]: 1.
Multiple enhancing lesions, in the brain and the cerebral and the cerebellar hemispheres, redemonstrated for surgical planning; the largest lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere measures 2.5 x 2.6 x 2.0 cm.
This is a limited study, performed for pre-surgical planning.

The patient was placed on hypertonic saline for the first night and was switched to salt tablets on [**4-6**] when his Na was 130.
Ultimately, he required intubation for the study.
It was felt that the right cerebellar lesion was of a sufficient size as to warrant resection before whole brain radation can be safely administered.
On [**4-14**], the patient underwent a right suboccipital craniotomy for tumor resection.
He tolerated the procedure well.
Appointments were made for the patient in terms of radiation therapy and GI endoscopy in accordance to the patient's request.
