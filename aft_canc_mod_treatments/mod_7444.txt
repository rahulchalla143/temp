Admission Date:  [**2148-6-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2148-6-17**]   Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 1181**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old woman with history of myelodysplastic syndrome and recent pneumonia who completed a course of levofloxacin and who complained of greenish watery diarrhea times one week and crampy diffuse abdominal pain.
On the day after admission, her hematocrit dropped from 20 to 7 to 20 and she was transfused two units of packed red blood cells.
Status post total knee replacement.
MEDICATIONS:  Levaquin, Protonix, Lisinopril, albuterol, Tylenol, Serevent, Epogen, hydrochlorothiazide, allopurinol and diltiazem.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted on [**6-1**] with acidosis, elevated lactate and gram negative stool and started on levofloxacin and Flagyl for infectious versus ischemic colitis.
She received intravenous fluid and packed red blood cells and PICC line was placed on [**6-5**].
Levofloxacin was started for positive urinalysis, but blood pressure did not respond to boluses or normal saline.
Therefore, she was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where she was switched to intravenous Flagyl and po vancomycin for better C. difficile coverage, as well as intravenous vancomycin because of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus from her PICC line.
Trial steroids were discontinued because they did not appear to be helping.
Her nasogastric tube was repositioned and she was able to tube feeds which she tolerated well and TPN was discontinued.
Plans were made for transfer to rehabilitation and Physical Therapy and Case Management were consulted.
She continued her course of vancomycin, Flagyl and levofloxacin and on [**2148-6-17**], she had increased secretions, which improved after respiratory suction.
There was no evidence of green dye from the tube feeds in the suction secretions.
The plan was made for a swallowing study to evaluate for the patient to advanced to po tube feeds and discontinue the nasogastric tube.
The right pleural effusion appeared possibly larger than the previous one, however, the chest x-ray was PA and lateral versus portables on prior films.
