Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right frontal parietal craniotomy on [**2101-1-2**].
The central portion of the mass is hypointense on T1-weighted images, without enhancement and demonstrate no evidence of slow diffusion.
This may be related to recent placement of a percutaneous gastrostomy tube, but correlation with examination and laboratory findings is recommended.

[**2101-1-10**] he was started on Cipro for a UTI for 10 days course (to end after last dose on [**1-20**]).

Glioblastoma: The patient was treated as above on the neurosurgery service, and was then transferred to oncology to receive radiation therapy.
Dilantin was continued, with monitoring of levels, and decadron taper was also continued.
This was likely multifactorial, with his neoplasm and recent surgery, along with related brain edema, as well as medications, constipation, and urinary retention and UTI all contributing.
He was given an aggressive bowel regimen, resulting in resolution of constipation.
The patient was also started on reglan and simethicone and encouraged to get out of bed and work with physical therapy frequently to prevent recurrence of his constipation and distention.
Initially he was catheterized every 8 hours, in the hopes that his urinary retention would resolve, but after several days he no longer tolerated catheterization (and refused further straight cath) and the foley catheter was replaced.
Doxazosin was started as well, but at the time of discharge the patient still required an indwelling catheter.
UTI: The patient was patient was initially started on ciprofloxacin on [**2101-1-10**] for a UTI.
The urine culture grew E. coli resistant to TMP/SMX and ciprofloxacin, so the patient was switched to augmentin to complete the course of treatment.
Culture again grew E. coli with similar sensitivities, so he was treated with ceftriaxone for 1 week.
Thrush: The patient was initially unable to effectively swish and swallow with nystatin, so he was treated with a course of fluconazole.
Nystatin swish and swallow was then initiated, and thrush was stable.
FEN: A PEG tube was placed on [**2101-1-16**] and tube feeds were started.
A repeat swallow evaluation prior to discharge was done, and the patient was then allowed to take small amounts of pureed food and nectar prethickened liquids with supervision for comfort.
The patient was also kept on sliding scale insulin coverage while he was on steroids.
