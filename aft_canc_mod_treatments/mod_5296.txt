Segmental instrumentation T1 to L3.
Prior to this the patient was ambulating with a cane and assistance.
He received cyperknife to L1 level late [**7-14**].
--- s/p XRT --- s/p stereotactic cingulotomy.

See prior MRI with gadolinium for better assessment.
Status-post cingulotomies, but no evidence for brain parenchymal metastases  Cultures: [**2128-1-19**] Blood - pending [**2128-1-19**] Urine - contaminated [**2128-1-19**] Blood - pending [**2128-1-17**] Blood - no growth [**2128-1-17**] Urine - enterococcus [**2128-1-19**] Blood - NGTD [**2128-1-19**] Urine - NGTD   Brief Hospital Course: At [**Hospital6 204**], lumbar CT scan showed diffuse osteopenia and lesions at L4-5 with compression fracture at L1 and fracture at L5.
He was started on tequin 400 mg IV qd for his bandemia.
He has required 11 units of packed red blood cells.
He received decadron 6mg IV q 6 hours for cord compression.
Patient received ancef x 48 hours peri-operatively and Prednisone 10 q 8.
On POD #4 patient was fit with a TLSO brace and continued to make progress slowly with physical therapy.
On [**2128-1-10**] patient was transfused 2 units of PRBC for hematocrit = 22 and symptomatic with tachycardia.
On [**2128-1-11**] he was transfused 6 pack of platelets for plt=25.
The hemovac drain was d/c'd [**1-14**] and he has had no further bleeding episodes.
From a cord compression standpoint, he remained stable s/p laminectomy and epidural hematoma evacuation.
He was originally on a PCA for pain control.
We were able to successfully switch the patient to a fentanyl patch with liquid oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
The patient continued to complain of trigeminal neuralgia that had been worsening over the past month.
Radiation Oncology felt there was no need for treatment at this time.
Because the patient is not currently a candidate for chemotherapy (low counts, advanced disease), he opted against the LP because it would not change our current management.
He was started on neurontin for the trigeminal neuralgia but it was discontinued because it was not providing relief.
He was treated with vanco and switched to levo when sensitives showed pansensitive enterococcus UTI.
He was treated with a full 10 day course.
During the time on the medicine service he was only neutropenic for 24 hours.
He continued to retain ([**2-12**] effects of the cord compression) and he was discharged with a foley in place.
His thrombocytoenia was likely multifactorial with a significant contribution from marrow suppression from XRT and chemotherapy.
He will need continual platelet tranfusions at rehab and at home (will be under bridge to hospice) to keep plts>50.
The patient also was anemia which again was thought to be multi-factorial from: 1) bone marrow suppression from XRT and chemotherapy (note retic=0.6) 2) anemia of chronic disease (note alb=2.8) 3) peri-operative blood loss 4) marrow infiltration by cancer (significant bony destruction on imaging, although no nucleated RBCs on smear).
He required much less frequent PRBC transfusion than platelets.
He required only 1 unit PRBC during his week on the medical service.
The patient will leave rehab with bridge to hospice so that he can continue transfusion and other treatment options.
