This worked quite well and your obstruction quickly resolved.
You were exxtubated without problem and will continue to receieve radiation as an outpatient.
You briefly needed a nasogastric tube to help you eat since the swelling in your mouth was so bad, but once it improved, our speech and swallow team decided that you could eat safely on your own.
While intubated in our ICU, you developed a fever and completed a course of antibiotics for a presumed pneumonia.
You also finished a course of fluconazole, an antifungal drug, for some thrush that you developed in your mouth, likely from your steroid medication.
We removed the line and applied warm compresses to the area.
We called our cardiologists and they recommended management with a beta blocker called carvedilol, which you should take as prescribed.
Please do not take your lasix until instructed otherwise by your PCP.
Please take all of your medicines as prescribed.
