EGD [**2150-5-26**] w/ gastritis/erosions; treated with PPI PO BID and repeat EGD [**2150-5-28**] showed interval improvement.
Fecal cx/campylobacter cx negative, however C. diff was positive and patient was started on Flagyl PO [**5-26**] (course completed [**2150-6-16**]).
Given recent right fem-posterior tibial bypass and right TMA c/b wound infection, he was covered with vanco/levo/flagyl and vascular surgery was consulted, who recommended right arterial duplex U/S.
His anticoagulation was changed from lepirudin to argatroban and he underwent a RLE arteriogram [**6-1**] which showed 80-99% stenosis at mid fem-posterior tibial argery graft; angioplasty performed X 2.
Declining clinical status was attributed to potential sepsis and antibiotics were broadened to Vanco IV/Flagyl PO/Vanco PO/Zosyn.
Given drop in HCT (26.3 from 33.1), drop in plt (33 from 106 on admit), argotroban was discontinued and hematology was consulted, who felt this was most likely secondary to septic physiology (no evidence of TTP or hemolysis).
The patient was extubated [**2150-6-7**], however he was re-intubated [**6-15**] for increased work of breathing, at which time antibiotic coverage was broadened to linezolid, levoquin, meropenem (PO vanco, PO flagyl, Zosyn, and IV vanco were discontinued).
He was transiently on levophed and was started on hydrocortisone given failed [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim.
His respiratory decompensation was felt to be most likely secondary to CHF exacerbation and lasix/nesiritide gtt were started.
Given large bilateral pleural effusions, right larger than left, a thoracentesis was performed [**2149-6-17**], the GS of which showed 1+ PMN without organisms, fluid analysis consistent with transudative process.
CVVH was not recommended, and patient was changed to bolus doses of chlorothiazide and furosemide with good effect.
On [**6-18**], given cx negative, changed to vanco/meropenem, which were discontinued [**2150-6-23**] at ID recommendation.
On transfer to the MICU, he was oxygenating well with a mild respiratory acidosis on minimal ventilatory support (PS 8/5).
Diuresis was continued and he was extubated [**2150-6-24**] without difficulty.
A beta-blocker was restarted.
3) Acute on chronic renal failure: Initial bump in creatinine to 2.4 [**6-5**] have represented contrast dye nephropathy in the setting of recent arteriogram versus ATN in the setting of hypotension due to SIRS/sepsis.
5) Metabolic alkalosis: The patient had a significant metabolic alkalosis on transfer to the MICU, likely secondary to contraction alkalosis in the setting of aggressive diuresis.
His chloride was repleted and his diuresis goals were decreased.
6) Resolved sepsis: The patient's initial intubation [**6-4**] was attributed to septic physiology.
By the time of transfer to the MICU, he had completed a 23 day course of C. diff therapy (PO vanco/PO flagyl), received 27 day course of MRSA therapy (vanco/linezolid), and had been covered broadly for gram negatives levoquin/zosyn/meropenem) for 27 days.
Given that he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable, without clinical evidence suggestive of infection, he was maintained off further antibiotics.
He had been started on stress-dose steroids during his SICU stay for treatment of relative adrenal insufficiency (diagnosis based on inadequate response to Cosyntropin stimulation).
They recommended discontinuation of amiodarone (given limited utility of continuing it as patient was in atrial flutter) and initiation of anticoagulation given high risk of thromboembolism.
Amiodarone was discontinued, a beta-blocker was restarted (with plan to titrate dose up as tolerated), and patient was restarted on lepirudin.
8) Thrombocytopenia: The worsening of the patient's chronic thrombocytopenia (nadir in the 30s) likely represented a combination of HIT (patient received small dose of heparin as part of heplock of right femoral line on [**6-5**], none subsequently) and septic phsyiology.
Heparin products were stringently avoided.
His Plavix and ASA were held with plan to restart once platelet count returns to baseline.
9) Anemia: Prior to transfer to the MICU, the patient had received a total of 5 units of PRBC (last transfusion [**2150-6-18**]).
He was started on erythropoietin (on darbopoietin as outpatient and his home iron was restarted.
At time of transfer to the MICU, he continued to have brown gauiac positive stool, although his hematocrit was stable.
He was continued on a proton pump inhibitor.
His statin was restarted at his home dose.
His Plavix and ASA were held given his persistant thrombocytopenia.
He was continued on his home dose of levothyroxine with a plan to recheck thyroid function tests as an outpatient once acute illness has resolved.
13) Type II DM: Following transfer to the MICU, the patient was continued lantus 8 units [**Hospital1 **] (increased from home dose 8 units qAM and 6 units qPM) with HISS.
IV antibiotics were discontinued initially, but subsquently restarted given diarrhea with the possibility of C.difficile colitis.
diuresing with lasix failed.
Patient was made CMO and started on a morphine drip and a scopolamine patch.
