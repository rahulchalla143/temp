Admission Date:  [**2126-2-15**]     Discharge Date:  [**2126-3-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2058-7-11**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67 year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's disease, iron deficiency anemia who has had on and off diarrhea since [**Month (only) **].
The patient was discharged from that procedure and doing fine.
Status post chemotherapy in [**2118**] and x-ray therapy in [**2118**], [**2122**] and [**2124**].
Right groin lymph node excision.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2126-2-15**] and received intravenous resuscitation, made NPO and prepared for exploratory laparotomy.
The patient had a total abdominal colectomy and ileostomy and small bowel resection performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells intraoperatively.
He was placed on vasopressors and fluid resuscitation was continued.
The patient had a Swan Ganz catheter in place to guide fluid resuscitation.
The patient had a JP drain left in place in the abdomen.
He was also left on perioperative antibiotics postoperatively including Ampicillin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
The patient was quickly weaned off his pressors with appropriate fluid resuscitation.
Over the course of the next few days it became evident that the patient had high capillary leak and received albumin to try to stimulate an increase in intravascular volume.
He was transfused multiple units of packed red blood cells and fresh frozen platelets.
The patient was initiated on total parenteral nutrition while awaiting return of bowel function.
Antibiotics were not changed at that time.
The PA line was changed as central venous line.
He was placed on Lopressor secondary to tachycardia and hypertension.
It was initially thought that he may have been overdiuresed, although because of the increase in fever blood cultures were sent and his central line was changed over a wire and then eventually removed and tip sent for culture.
It was felt that this was not a purulent drainage as a result of resection, but rather necrotic tumor.
Vancomycin was added due to the blood culture positive for MRSA.
Speech and swallow was consulted to attempt allowing the patient to swallow although he did not do well with this test.
On the 6th the patient was started on tube feeds secondary to lack luster and eating.
Vasopressors were started as well as Fluconazole empirically as tube feeds were stopped.
Oncology indicated at that time that the likelihood that the patient would survive another four months would be unlikely and that with his current question of sepsis any further treatment chemotherapeutically was unwise.
They also indicated that if the patient were to improve the patient would not likely live four months even with chemotherapy as chemotherapy would only be palliative.
