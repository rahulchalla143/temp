Therefore, pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for mediastinoscopy and further care.
Pt will require ICU given possibility of tumor swelling causing complete SVC occlusion (IR vs. vasc would need to stent).
Trachea is not particularly displaced and narrowed, so the extent of mediastinal mass is not appreciated on this study and would require cross-sectional imaging for assessment.

A subcapsular area of signal loss is identified on out-of-phase imaging in the anterior aspect of segment IVb of the liver compared to the in-phase images, appearing to corresponding to the focal area of low attenuation identified on CT performed at outside hospital [**2171-2-11**].
The lesion exhibits low signal in comparison to the adjacent hepatic parenchyma on fat-suppressed T1 imaging, and is difficult to characterize on post-contrast imaging due to motion artifact.
Note: The specimen consists of groups of pleomorphic  	epithelioid cells with vesicular chromatin, small nucleoli  	and scattered mitoses.
Chemotherapy started in house day 1: [**2171-2-16**] with regimen of Dexamethasone 20 mg IV DAILY Duration: 5 Doses, CISplatin 40 mg IV Days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, Etoposide 195 mg IV Days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
Pt tolerated chemotherapy very well without evidence of tumor lysis syndrome.
Pt briefly started on ctx and azithro to cover post-obstructive PNA on [**2171-2-16**], however, these were discontinued on [**2171-2-17**] given no e/o PNA.
He had minimal side effects of nausea which was well controlled with Ativan, Zofran and standing Compazine.
Patient's alpha fetal protein level was 1310 on [**2-16**] and 1286 on [**2-22**], leading the oncology team to be concerned that he would need a different regimen as an outpatient, including possible Bleomycin.
Pt was treated with heparin drip and transitioned to Lovenox.
#pulmonary emboli-Noted on outside hospital CT. Pt was maintained on heparin as above.
Etiology could include malignancy vs. infection vs. medication effect.
Medications on Admission: MEDICATIONS: none at home; Meds on transfer: Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID 1000 mL LR Continuous at 50 ml/hr Order date: [**2-16**] @ 0950 Heparin IV Alprazolam 0.5-1 mg PO/NG TID:PRN anxiety Omeprazole 40 mg PO DAILY  Orde Azithromycin 500 mg PO/NG Q24H CeftriaXONE 1 gm IV Q24H zolpidem 5mg qhs .
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 8300**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - germ cell-teratoma of the mediastinum - superior vena cava syndrome - pulmonary embolism   Discharge Condition: mentating well, ambulating independently   Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] from [**Hospital 5279**] Hospital for evaluation and treatment of a mass in your chest that was obstructing the veins in your neck.
You were in the intensive care unti and started on chemotherapy.
You will probably have to have your blood checked for alpha fetal protein at that time.
You will also receive paperwork in the mail to return to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13551**].
