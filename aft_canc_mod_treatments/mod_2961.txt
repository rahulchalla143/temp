Admission Date:  [**2107-5-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2107-6-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2043-12-24**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HEPATOBILIARY SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Briefly, this is a 63 year old male who has a history of metastatic rectal carcinoma who had been seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Location (un) 4121**] where he had a resection of his primary tumor as well as a liver resection.
He returns now to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2107-5-9**], for an elective caudate lobe resection for recurrence as well as radiofrequency ablation of the lateral segmental mass as well as insertion of an infusion pump into his hepatic artery.
The patient has a past medical history significant for his rectal cancer, hypertension, hernia repair.
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2107-5-9**], where a caudate lobe resection, radiofrequency ablation of lateral segment mass and infusion pump procedure was performed.
He tolerated the procedure well and was continued on antibiotics, Unasyn, for prophylaxis.
He slowly began having difficulty with oxygenation on [**2107-5-11**], where he dropped his O2 saturation to 86% and his respiratory rate rise to 40.
Lopressor 100 mg p.o.
Cardizem 120 p.o.
Pravachol 40 mg p.o.
Zestril 15 mg p.o.
The patient also has a colostomy from his primary rectal cancer resection.
It was felt that the confusion was secondary to the radiofrequency ablation and chemotherapy agents that were given, and he was continued to be monitored for this.
Neurology felt that limiting his medications would be one step in helping to clear his confusion.
He was continued on his Unasyn for this elevated white count as well as his temperatures.
On [**2107-5-18**], it was decided that he would be taken back to the Operating Room for a re-exploration and for removal of his infusion pump.
He was continued on his Unasyn and AmBisome for that time, however, postoperatively, in order to broaden coverage, his Unasyn was changed to Zosyn.
The patient was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on [**5-23**]/3004, on postoperative day number 14 and 5, after being afebrile for over five days.
His white count had decreased down to 18 at this time and he was started on a clear liquid diet as well as continuing on his total parenteral nutrition.
He was kept on morphine intermittently for pain control, Haldol for confusion, Lopressor, Protonix, and Regular insulin for his total parenteral nutrition.
The patient was also transfused two units of blood on [**2107-5-28**], postoperative days 19 and 10, for a low hematocrit of 25.6.
His wound, which was left open after the second operation, was packed with normal saline wet-to-dry dressing.
Granulation slowly improved the wound site, therefore a VAC drain was placed.
The VAC drain put out low amounts and continued wound healing and was removed just prior to discharge to the rehabilitation facility.
Instructions were given for assessment of the wound upon arrival to the rehabilitation facility with the decision of whether wet-to-dry dressing or VAC dressing could be used.
The patient slowly improved mentally and Physical Therapy was consulted for ambulation on [**2107-5-31**].
The patient began ambulating with Physical Therapy and he did well.
Two days prior to discharge, he was able to take 75 percent of his caloric needs and 75 percent of his protein needs p.o., tolerating a regular diet with Boost supplementation and his total parenteral nutrition was continued in order to help him with wound care and to boost his immune status.
He was also started on Marinol 5 mg p.o.
He had a PICC line placed in his left arm which was used for total parenteral nutrition and antibiotics.
His Foley catheter was removed.
His abdominal drains were removed and sites were dressed.
The wound itself was clean, dry and intact and granulating well when the VAC drain was removed.
Upon time of discharge, he would have completed 22 days, therefore, six more days were needed and he would complete his course of AmBisome on [**2107-6-11**].
He was going to be continued on Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Lopressor 100 mg p.o.
Cardizem 120 p.o.
Pravachol 40 p.o.
Zoloft 15 mg p.o.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
His morphine and Haldol were held due to somnolence and he was only treated intermittently with pain medications, specifically with dressing changes.
He also had Marinol added to his regimen, 5 mg p.o.
four times a day as well as Boost supplementation for his diet.
Rectal cancer, status post resection and colostomy.
Status post right hepatectomy for metastases.
Now status post caudate lobe resection, radiofrequency ablation and infusion pump insertion.
Status post exploratory laparotomy washout and removal of infusion port.
Continue with wound care at that time.
