Admission Date:  [**2163-1-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-1-25**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 19684**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from [**Hospital3 2558**] for increasing pulmonary rales and 4lbs weight gain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year-old male with a PMHx significant for aortic stenosis (peak/mean gradient 60/32 mm HG in [**2162-8-8**]), CHF with EF 35% in [**2162-8-8**], chronic atrial fibrillation on Coumadin therapy, DM type 2, hypertension and MDS with anemia and thrombocytopenia, transferred from NH for further evaluation of "worsening CHF".
During this admission and at discharge, Metoprolol D/C'd (was on 50 mg PO BID), Lasix decreased to 40 mg PO BID, Zaroxylyn D/C'd, Aldactone D/C'd, Quinine D/C'd.
Per NH notes, patient noted to have increasing pulmonary crackles 3 days PTA and was given an additional 80 mg PO of Lasix.
Worsening pulmonary crackles were noted this AM, and patient received an additional Lasix 40 mg IV X 1 in addition to usual 80 mg PO.
He was given Lasix 40 mg IV X 1.
H/o lung cancer s/p resection in [**2155**].
Using abdominal muscles.
Brief Hospital Course: 89 year-old male with multiple medical problems including CHF with EF 35%, severe AS, severe MDS with thrombocytopenia, chronic atrial fibrillation on Coumadin on admission, HTN and DM type 2, admitted with weight gain and increasing pulmonary rale, as well as severe thrombocytopenia.
He is chronically fluid overloaded with a tenuous intravascular volume status in the setting of AS, and aggressive diuresis in the past has resulted in dehydration and ARF.
On admission, he was felt to be likely in mild CHF, and was given Lasix 40 mg IV X 1 in ED.
On the floor, he was continued on Lasix 40 mg PO BID, with fair diuresis and slow improvement in his respiratory status.
Lasix was temporarily held in the setting of low BP and likely GI bleed (see below) but resumed on [**2163-1-19**] and titrated to TID dosing.
He will need daily weights and careful monitoring of his fluid balance, with extra Lasix as needed for >= 3 lbs weight gain as BP tolerates.
2) Wheezing: Patient had significant wheezing in hospital, felt likely cardiac asthma, treated with standing Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.
Despite bronchodilator therapy and diuresis, he continued to have wheezing and SOB, but saturation stable on room air.
Nonetheless, given his slow improvement and airway secretions, he was started on empiric Levofloxacin on [**2163-1-22**] to complete 7 days.
Patient was given 1 bag of platelets and Coumadin therapy was held.
MICU and GI team were both called, and the patient was administered blood products to keep Hct>30, Plt>25 and INR<=1.5.
He was also started on Protonix IV BID.
He received 1 of 3 doses of vitamin K and will continue on Protonix PO BID with GI follow-up.
While in hospital, Imdur was D/C'd given his severe AS, and he was started on low-dose Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID.
Of note, no ASA given thrombocytopenia.
Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**], he was started on Danazol for MDS +/-ITP and will need follow-up as an out-patient.
6) Atrial fibrillation: Patient with chronic atrial fibrillation on Coumadin on admission.
After discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 141**] and primary team, decision was taken to D/C long-term anticoagulation in the setting of likely GI bleed, severe thrombocytopenia and fall risk.
Rate controlled on Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID.
