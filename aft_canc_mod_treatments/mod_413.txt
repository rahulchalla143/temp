IMPRESSION:  Patient is a 59-year-old male with history of malignant metastatic melanoma failed multiple regimens complicated by brain metastases status post XRT and Decadron who presents with complaints of fatigue and subsequently found to be hypotensive and minimally responsive to volume resuscitation.
He was started on stress dose steroids as well as IV vancomycin and IV ceftriaxone and was continued on dopamine and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.
Intravenous fluids were continued as were the stress dose steroids and broad spectrum antibiotics and the dopamine was slowly weaned over the next several days with gradual improvement of urine output as well as pressures.
He was continued on ceftriaxone and vancomycin for broad spectrum coverage.
Antibiotics were continued for the next six days and were discontinued as the goals of care were now felt to be more of comfort care as opposed to active treatment after extensive discussion with the family who now feel that they would not like to pursue aggressive treatment at this point.
Code Status:  After a lengthy discussion with the family, social worker and palliative care team, it was felt that goals of care would now be for comfort only and would not pursue any active resuscitation or intubation if the patient's condition were to significantly worsen and for this reason he will be listed as a DNR/DNI.
Patient is comfortable and currently without any focal complaints and may be discharged to a hospice facility for further management and end of life care.
