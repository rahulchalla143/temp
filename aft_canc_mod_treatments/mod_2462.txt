His blood pressure was stable on this regimen and he was noted to be bradycardic in the 40s-50s.

On floor increased Amiodarone 400 mg from 200 mg once a day, decreased Metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], and slowly weaned Diltiazem drip.
Decided pacer best option as we could then increase rate control medications without worrying about brady-junctional rhythm.
