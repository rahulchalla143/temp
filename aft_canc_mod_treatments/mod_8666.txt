During the recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**], his lisinopril dose was increased and he was started on amlodipine.
Other additions to his medications included Keppra and metoprolol.
In the field, prior to arrival, he received epinephrine and diphenhydramine, and per the ED report his symptoms had improved at the time he reached [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
He received IV Solumedrol and Pepsid.
ENT was not called because his oropharynx was clearly visualized and emergent laryngoscopy was not felt to be necessary.
He was in the neurologic intensive care unit for 2 days due to need for nicardipine drip for blood pressure control.
At time of discharge, he was started on amlodipine, metoprolol, Keppra, and ciprofloxacin, and the dose of his lisinopril was increased from 30 mg daily to 40 mg daily.
Past Medical History: - stress test [**2116**] negative - hypertension - diabetes type II - recent intraparenchymal hemorrhage, as above - chronic low back pain - atrophic left kidney - papillary renal cell cancer s/p resection in [**2123-10-13**] (partial nephrectomy and distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy) - h/o SCC - 120-pack-year history of smoking cigarettes - history of migraine headaches  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: - left TKR - b/l cataract - sternal fx repair - hemorrhoidectomy - VC bx   Social History: He is married with five children.
Review of medications showed that he was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] and during that admission his Lisinopril was increased and he was started on Amlodipine, also started on Keppra and Metoprolol.
Oddly, he was also taking both Irbesartan and Lisinopril.
Keppra and Metoprolol were not felt to be causative.
Amlodipine, Irbesartan, and Lisinopril were all held on admission and not restarted.
Lisinopril was added to pt's allergy list.
Pt was given Decadron 10 mg IV x3 doses.
His lisinopril, Irbesartan, and Amlodipine were held as above.
If he continues to be hypertensive, it was discussed in the ICU that he should try Chlorthalidone, or Metoprolol switched to Labetalol or Carvedilol for alpha-adrenergic blocking effects.
Type II diabetes: Pt had elevation in his blood sugars likely due to steroid effect, and he was given Humalog sliding scale for control instead of his home Metformin/Glyburide.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with tongue swelling which may be due to some medication changes that were recently made.
We think this may be due to a recent increase in your Lisinopril; however it's possible that Irbesartan or Amlodipine may have caused this.
There's no way to be 100% sure, so we have held these medications and they have been added to your allergy list, because if you are re-exposed to these meds, you could have a more serious allergic reaction with the risk of serious injury or death.
The following changes have been made to your medication regimen:  1.
