Brief Hospital Course: This is a pleasant 83 y.o male with a history of HTN, advanced MDS, a fib, CVA, colon cancer s/p ostomy admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension in the setting of infection, likely GU and GI sources.
The patient's hypotension and elevated lactate resolved and leukocytosis improved after 2L IV NS in ED and broad spectrum antibiotics.
Given one dose of high dose steroids in ED, unlikely to be adrenal insufficency, treated with home dose of prednisone.
C. diff toxin was positive, and patient was treated with PO Flagyl.
