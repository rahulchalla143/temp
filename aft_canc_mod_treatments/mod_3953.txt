The surgery occurred without complication.
One [**Doctor Last Name **] drain was left in place during the surgery, and the drain followed bulb protocol from the patient's time in the PACU.
Patient did well on the night of his operation with his [**Doctor Last Name **] drain to bulb suction, however he had a sudden episode of desaturation and a temperature spike on PD#1.
The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (levaquin, vanco, flagyl, and transplant hepatlogy and ID were consulted for recs of fever management.

IN the face of normal temperatures and a declining fevers and WBC counts, the patient was thought to be stable for discharge on a 5-day course of Doxycycline po.
