Pericardiocentesis   History of Present Illness: Patient is a 60F with ER negative, Her-2/neu positive breast cancer with mets to lymph node, pericardium, spleen, and bone who was recently receiving chemoradiation at which time she became short of breath and was found to have laryngeal edema and vocal cord paralysis.
She was admitted to the ICU where she had a trach placed, a chest tube placed for a large Left pleural efusion and a pericardial window for malignant pericardial effusion with a pulsus paradoxus of 15 to 20 prior to pericardiocentesis and window.
After resolution of these problems (see hospital course) , due to the progressive nature of her disease despite recent therapy with radiation to her left brachial plexus and xeloda and herceptin, she was transferred to the oncology service for additional chemotherapy with Adriamycin and Cytoxan.

Discharge Labs: CBC: WBC-5.0 ; Hct-25.7 (before transfusion 1U PRBCs) ; PLT - 45 Chem: Na-140 ; K-3.7 ; Cl-104 ; HCO3-28 ; BUN-6 ; Cr-0.5 PT-20.8 ; INR-3.1 ; Fibrinogen-495  Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 60yo F with metastatic breast cancer who has received multiple chemotherapy regimens and radiation ([**8-22**]) for left brachial plexus tumor invasion with progression of disease.
Pericardiocentesis was performed with drainage of 480cc turbid and bloody fluid, culture was negative and cytology revealed maligancy.
She underwent a left chest VATS, pleural biopsy, and pericardial window, and a pericardial drain was placed.
Patient's effusion will be followed with subsequent imaging and clinical exam by her oncologist on outpatient visits.
Shortness of breath: Patient's shortness of breath upon initial presentation was thought to be likely multi-factorial, with vocal cord paralysis/laryngeal edema as side effect of radiation, tumor obstruction of endotracheal tree, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, pulmonary edema, and PNA.
Additionally, as initial CT showed a large left pleural effusion, a chest tube was placed on [**2137-9-15**], which drained more than 1.4L of serosanguinous fluid.
As the patient was demonstrating tamponade physiology with worsening hypotension the patient underwent pericardiocentesis for immediate relief followed by a left VATS procedure with a pericardial window.
After stabilization and transfer to the floor for additional chemotherapy given progression of disease, the patient's trach was noted to continue to put out large amounts of thick mucous and she was started on levofloxacin and flagyl empirically for aspiration pneumonia, although the patient was afebrile.
By this time, the patient had completed 6 days of Levo/Flagyl and antibiotics were held as it was thought that the patient's clinical improvement was likely secondary to fluid diuresis rather than an infectious etiology.
As the patient is HIT Ab positive, the patient could not be started on Heparin, but was instead started on an argatroban drip for anti-coagulation.
The patient therefore received 5 days of argatroban and coumadin overlap, and is currently receiving anticoagulation with coumadin only.
The pulmonary team was consulted to evaluate the patient given her ongoing sputum production and the above previously visualized ground glass opacities.
Sputum cultures were performed and were found to be growing Acinetobaceter, multi-drug resistant, but sensitive to tobramycin and gentamycin.
Repeat CT was suggested as well as starting cefepime 2gm q8hr with gentamycin 5mg/kg IV q24hr for a fever spike given the patient's known acinetobacter.
The patient is thought to requre still additional rehab and will go to an extended care facility for ongoing rehabilitation and PT.
Therefore, on [**2137-9-30**] the patient began treatment with Adriamycin and cytoxan (A/C) which was tolerated well.
The patient had a pan-cytopenia secondary to myelosuppression requiring transfusion of 1U of PRBC for Hct of 23.5 with appropriate bump but did not require any platelet transfusions.
The patient will require additional cycles of A/C.
Given the patient's complicated hospital course and sub-optimal performance status at this time, she likely will receive cycles of chemotherapy every two to three weeks.
She is planned to follow up with the office of her Oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] upon discharge for additional chemotherapy and management of her cancer.
She will need to be seen on [**2137-10-18**] for additional chemotherapy and has been given instructions to call Dr.[**Name (NI) 17513**] office to confirm appointment time.
All heparin containing products were avoided.
The patient did not require any platelet transfusions and has not had any adverse bleeding events, even in the setting of thrombocytopenia and anti-coagulation for her DVT/PE.
Nutrition: Patient had a video swallowing study and it was recommendedable that an appropriate diet would be ground solids and thin liquids originally after multiple procedures.
