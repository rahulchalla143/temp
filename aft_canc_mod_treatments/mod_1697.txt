HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old gentleman with a history of multiple myeloma who was - on the day of admission - day 41 status post a matched unrelated nonmyeloablative allogenic transplant.
He was treated with VAD, followed by stem cell mobilization with Cytoxan, with high- dose chemotherapy stem cell rescue.
He was treated with thalidomide alone but developed neuropathy.
In [**2146-11-26**], he was treated with four cycles of Velcade, still with a dropping platelet count, increasing neuropathy, and only a modest decrease in his IgG level; which subsequently then began to increase.
On [**2147-4-12**], he was admitted for a nonmyeloablative allogenic transplant on the mini-MUD protocol.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Tonsillectomy as a child.
Appendectomy in the early [**2123**].
Multivitamin every day.
Folic acid 1 mg once per day.
Protonix 40 mg once per day.
Lopressor 2.5 mg twice per day.
Ursodiol 300 mg twice per day.
Allopurinol 200 mg once per day.
Fluconazole 200 mg once per day.
Neurontin 300 mg twice per day.
Fentanyl 50-mcg patch q.72h.
Oxycodone 5 mg to 10 mg q.4-6h.
Neoral 25 mg twice per day (stopped on [**2147-5-30**]).
Prednisone 5 mg once per day.
Colace 100 mg twice per day.
Senna one to two tablets by mouth twice per day as    needed.
Ativan 0.5 mg to 1 mg q.6h.
Compazine 10 mg q.6h.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY-IMAGING:  A computed tomography of the chest from [**2147-5-30**] revealed stable cardiomegaly, increased size of the left anterior, left paravertebral, right paravertebral pleural-based soft tissue lesions.
He was treated with Levaquin initially; however, early on became febrile and was changed to therapy with cefepime.
He was continued on treatment with cefepime and Levaquin with minimal change in fever curve or symptoms.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient continued to be febrile despite Levaquin and cefepime.
Due to this radiographic improvement, it was felt that holding off on bronchoscopy was advisable, and the patient was continued on Levaquin and voriconazole alone.
Thus, it was decided to complete a course of antibiotics as there was still no clear indication of the etiology of this right middle lobe process.
The voriconazole was stopped first, and he then completed a 14-day course of Levaquin without further fevers.
After the Medical Intensive Care Unit stay on [**6-4**], the patient was seen by Cardiology and loaded on amiodarone and was put into a normal sinus rhythm.
Eventually, the amiodarone was stopped due to the patient's dysphagia and inability to swallow pills.
Eventually, a nasogastric tube was placed and the medications were being given down the nasogastric tube at 400 mg a day, but subsequently - on [**6-20**] - the patient developed atrial fibrillation again with a rapid ventricular rate; again causing hypotension.
He was quickly converted chemically back to a normal sinus rhythm and reloaded on amiodarone through the nasogastric tube.
We plan to continue the amiodarone taper at 400 mg twice per day times seven days, followed by twice per day times seven days, followed by once per day times two weeks, followed by 200 mg once per day as maintenance.
SOMNOLENCE ISSUES:  As mentioned above, following the patient's amiodarone load on [**6-4**] he became somnolent.
It was unclear if this was related to an infection, or a medication such as amiodarone, or being over liberal with Ativan for nausea.
It was felt it could be an aseptic meningitis due to medication versus due to multiple myeloma, and it was never clear if the cerebrospinal fluid findings corresponding to the patient's somnolence; as over a number of days, with the titration of his amiodarone and the holding of his Ativan dosing, the patient's mental status returned to baseline.
It was eventually decreased to use empiric radiation therapy to the base of the skull to treat possible basilar meningitis or any compressive lesions not able to be seen by imaging.
A nasogastric tube was placed, and medications were given through that.
NAUSEA, VOMITING, AND DIARRHEA ISSUES:  Early in the patient's course, he had high-volume diarrhea as well as frequent nausea and vomiting.
He was on low-dose Solu-Medrol for a brief time.
BACK PAIN ISSUES:  The patient with baseline back pain on admission; however, it became more and more severe leading to a magnetic resonance imaging of the spine which revealed metastatic disease in all visualized bones with soft tissue masses at T10-T11 and C11 with collapse of T7, and soft tissue masses at L3, but no cord compression, as well as a questionable pathologic fracture of the coccyx and sacrum.
He was started on radiation therapy from T6 to L4 as well as to the base of the skull (as discussed above).
The patient's pain was managed with a Dilaudid patient-controlled analgesia.
He Fentanyl patch had been stopped due to a theoretical risk of asystole with amiodarone and Fentanyl.
The patient was therefore started on further chemotherapy with Velcade and Decadron, and there was discussion as to the possibility of eventual donor liver site infusion.
In the setting of the rapid ventricular rate and the high risk for aspiration, it was felt that an aspiration pneumonia could be contributing so he was started on a course of Levaquin and Flagyl.
They subsequently trended down, but tube feedings were attempted with a resultant bump in amylase and lipase.
Tube feedings are being held currently.
He had evidence of fluid overload including crackles in S4 and elevated jugular venous pressure, but diuresis was difficult due to his tendency to go back into atrial fibrillation when he became dry as well as a tentative blood pressure.
He received intravenous fluids over the first few days on admission with an improvement in creatinine down to his baseline of 0.7, which remained that way throughout the remainder of his course.
