He recived fentanyl 250 mg IV X 1 during the chest tube insertion.

STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE.
STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE.
IMPRESSION: Interval development of large left pneumothorax  CT Chest ([**8-30**]): 1.
Diffuse mosaic attenuation reflects small airway obstruction, a finding often seen with transplant-related, bronchiolitis obliterans  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 24735**] is a 63 y/o male with a history of AML s/p allo SCT [**10/2144**] (D+703), chronic GVHD (liver, skin, ?lung) on prednisone and cyclosporine who presented from home with fever to 102 and increasing shortness of breath after bronchoscopy/biopsy on the day prior to admission, found to have left pneumothorax and persistent LLL consolidation.
#.PNEUMOTHORAX: Patient had a bronchoscopy with biopsy on the day prior to admission which likely caused pneumothorax to develop.
Chest tube was placed in the ER with re-expansion of the lung.
Patient was followed by interventional pulmonology Patient self-discontinued chest tube on the evening of admission, and serial chest x-rays showed that the lung remained expanded without need for replacement of chest tube.
Patient was weaned off of oxygen successfully and repeat chest x-rays continued to show no reaccumulation of pneumothorax.
On [**10-23**], vancomycin was discontinued and pt started on Levoquin.
As patient reported history of achilles tendon swelling on Levoquin, as well as h/o diarrhea with penicillins and macrolides (augmentin and azithromycin are best agents for moraxella), he was switched to moxifloxacin 400mg PO BID to complete 2 week course.
He has tolerated moxifloxacin in the past without complications.
Per above, patient treated with moxifloxacin rather than levoquin due to h/o achilles tendon swelling on levoquin.
#.AML s/p ALLOGENEIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANT: pt is s/p 7+3 with idarubacin and ARA-C, followed by HiDAC consolidation.
He received allogeneic SCT from an unrelated on [**2144-11-12**] after conditioning with fludarabine, busulfan, and ATG.
# GVHD OF LIVER, SKIN AND ?LUNG: complication of patient's allogeneic stem cell transplant in [**2143**].
Patient continued on home Prednisone 10mg PO daily and Cyclosporin 25mg PO daily.
