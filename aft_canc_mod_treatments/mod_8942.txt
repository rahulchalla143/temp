PMH: -CAD status post CABG in [**2144**].
-History of aortic valve replacement with a mechanical valve in [**2144**].
-S/p nephrostomy tube placement for right ureter obstruction by lymphoma.
- Cavitating lesion found in left lung in [**2150**] on CT scan, underwent bronchoscopy after which revealed a likely a BOOP-like reaction although unclear to what (transient infection vs medication reaction).
He was never required to see pulmonology in follow-up - Hypersensitivity skin reaction and pruritis secondary to increased dose of amlodipine, [**2-/2153**] - left urethral stricture repair [**2153-7-3**] - hypertension - hyperlipidemia - CKD Stage III with GFR 43   Social History: Lives with wife.

Right femoral neck lesion: - [**Month/Day/Year **] clot and bone fragments with features consistent with fracture; a Hematopathology Note will follow as addendum.
Note: Sections of cortical and trabecular bone and bone marrow with extensive crush artifact.
[**2153-12-6**] investigation of transfusion reaction: DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Mr. [**Known lastname 109953**] experienced a temperature increase of 2.6 degrees F over the first 100 minutes of a leukoreduced compatible red [**Known lastname **] cell transfusion.

3143**] TSH-1.8  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a 71-year-old man with a hx of follicular lymphoma and a remote history of high-grade lymphoma, CAD, CABG, AVR on coumadin, HTN, CKD III who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with a hip fracture.
Pt was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] and had an open biopsy of right femoral neck and a right hip hemiarthroplasty (press-fit) on [**2153-11-30**].
Pt was controlled with IV Dilaudid (avoided metabolites with morphine in CKD).
Was given linezolid x1 for prophylaxis.
Pain was controlled with oxycodone, standing tylenol, lidocaine patch.
Dressing should be dry sterile dressing to wound site.
Most likely explanation was an acute bleed, especially given that he has been on a heparin ggt and coumadin post-op, in combination with recent Chemo txt, suppressing bone marrow production.
Pt's heparin drip was stopped.
Pt recently received chemotherapy 1 week prior, which may explain platelet drop but less likely to affect Hct.
Unlikely to have been acute hemolysis since LDH and haptoglobin were normal.
Pt's Hct was stable at ~28 for 2 days, even after restarting his anticoagulation, initially with heparin drip, for his aortic mechanical valve (see below), and Pt was transferred back out to the floor on [**12-5**].
Pathology ultimately determined that this was unlikely to be a transfusion reaction and pt was continued on heparin gtt.
After ensuring HCT stability, coumadin was restarted on [**2153-12-10**] at 7.5mg daily.
Heparin should continue until INR therapeutic.
Could use transfusion criteria for HCT <25, given heart disease, however given recent acute illness and ?transfusion reaction, would consider more conservative approach and transfuse for HCT drop and/or symptoms.
#Mechanical Aortic valve on Coumadin (INR Goal [**12-21**]).
Patient's INR in ED 4.7 --> received Vitamin K 5mg IV x1.
He was on a heparin drip after his orthopedic procedure, but this was stopped after he developed a large Hct drop (see above).
His outpatient cardiologist felt that it would be fine to stop anticoagulation since this is an aortic mechanical valve until his Hct stabilizes for 24 hours.
His heparin drip was restarted on [**12-5**], then intermittantly stopped [**12-6**] (see above) and then again resumed when CT did not show evidence of acute bleeding.
Heparin drip continued and coumadin was added on [**2153-12-10**] after ensuring HCT stability.
Would continue heparin gtt until INR is therapeutic.
Pt did have a pyuria on his admission UA for which empiric Levofloxacin was started, but this was stopped after his urine cultures were negative after 2 days.
Pt spiked more fevers throughout [**12-5**] and had significant shaking chills, and vancomycin and cefepime were started empirically.
His foley was also changed.
Given that CXR and cx's remained negative without further fevers, these antibiotics were dc'd and pt has remained afebrile without a leukocytosis for >48hours.
Neurology was consulted, who felt his symptoms were most likely due to pain medications in the setting of hypotension and severe anemia.
# Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Baseline Cr 1.3-1.5.
Resolved back to 1.4 with fluids and clinical improvement overall including [**Month (only) **] transfusion following hct of 17 (see above).
Pt reports that he is due for his next cycle of chemotherapy in [**Month (only) **].
