Radiologic Data: NCHCT OSH Report: "The patient is status post clipping of aneurysm with left frontoparietal craniotomy.
<br> Head CT with contrast: FINDINGS: A ventriculoperitoneal catheter is noted extending across the right frontal region and terminating in the third ventricle.
<br> MRI/MRA neck/head/brain [**2106-1-25**]:  FINDINGS: There are numerous enhancing lesions throughout the brain, some with central cavitation.
Dilatation of ventricles without midline shift.
The previously seen enhancing masses are not well visualized due to lack of IV contrast.
There is also a large area of edema involving the left cerebellar hemisphere as before surrounding a metastasis.
Aneurysm clips are seen in the left sylvian fissure and the left paraclinoid region as before.
Extensive anterolateral T wave inversions with associated Q-T interval prolongation and borderline ST segment elevation in lead V2.
There is a right-sided subclavian central line whose tip is not imaged.
Vertebral body heights and disc spaces are maintained.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the entire anterior septum, anterior wall, and apex (EF 30-35%) .

[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]: In the [**Name (NI) 153**], pt received a mannitol infusion with taper per neurology recommendations.
IV steroids and dilantin were continued.
Oncology was consulted and did not feel that further systemic chemo intervention was warranted.
IV access was maintained with TLC as unable to obtain PIVs.
We did place an NGT to begin tube feedings per S/S recommendations, however the pt self d/c'ed the NGT despite restraints.
As mental status appeared to be clearing with mannitol, dilantin, steroids, and whole brain XRT, decision was made to hold off on replacing NGT until MS cleared.
Medical Floor Course: 1) Small Cell lung cancer with Mets to the Brain/Adrenal gland The patient continued with XRT (10 sessions total planned).
She was continued on decadron IV.
Meeting held with patient's sister, [**Name (NI) **], to explain poor overall prognosis even with chemotherapy - decided on no chemotherapy - plan to arrange [**Hospital1 1501**] and Hospice Care.
