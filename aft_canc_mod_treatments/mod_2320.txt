Admission Date:  [**2106-2-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2106-2-19**]   Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old gentleman with a history of advanced prostate cancer who presented with obstructive jaundice from external lymph node compression.
The patient has had frequent nausea and vomiting and was sent for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 69**], status post duodenal stenting today at the proximal common bile duct, and internal and external biliary drain placement.
The patient was transferred to the floor after the percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography for observation.
Prostate cancer with diffuse metastatic disease; duodenal and biliary stents in place.
Status post radiation therapy and transurethral resection of prostate.
Right superficial femoral vein deep venous thrombosis on [**2106-2-2**].
History of inferior vena cava stent placement in [**2105-12-12**] due to compressive lymphadenopathy.
Plavix 75 mg once per day.
Nexium 40 mg once per day.
Ketoconazole 200 mg once per day.
Cortisone 20 mg once per day.
Potassium chloride 20 mEq once per day.
Vitamin C 500 mg once per day.
Vitamin E 800 units once per day.
A nasogastric tube was dropped and had return of frank blood.
The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells, 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, nasogastric lavage of 2 liters did not clear at all.
The patient became increasingly fatigued, and further interventions were discussed with the interventional radiologists and gastrointestinal consultants to evaluate the best treatment for the duodenal obstruction.
The patient's primary oncologist was called to discuss indications for further treatment who reported that the patient's ketoconazole and hydrocortisone were used as palliative measures and that the patient understood from previous conversations that there was no further treatment available.
To prevent further gastrointestinal ulcerations, the hydrocortisone was discontinued, and a family meeting was called to discuss plans for care.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] placed a stent with a duodenal stent to open up the obstruction.
The patient started oral intake and had frequent coffee-grounds emesis.
The patient had repeated hypotension to the 70s, mentating well, which improved to the 90s to 100 with a 1-liter intravenous fluid bolus.
Repeat lower extremity Doppler studies revealed that the right-sided deep venous thrombosis was still present, and there was great concern over how to manage this best given the patient's need for anticoagulation, concern for pulmonary embolism given the presence of the deep venous thrombosis, unlikely benefit of an inferior vena cava filter, and the persistent inability for the patient take oral intake well and get adequate nutrition in the context of severe worsening metastatic disease.
The patient discussed plans of care and determined that he wanted to go home to focus his care on comfort rather than painful treatment with unknown benefit or increased duration of life span.
The patient was made comfort measures only and sent home with hospice services.
Prochlorperazine 25-mg suppository q.12h.
Scopolamine patch q.72h.

Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8271**] reported that she would follow up with the patient and continue care as an outpatient.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was unable to ambulate at all, requiring oxygen 3 liters to have normal saturations.
