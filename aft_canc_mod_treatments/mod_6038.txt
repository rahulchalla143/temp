Heart size is enlarged with pacer leads noted within the right ventricle.
Pacemaker leads terminate in right atrium and right ventricle, the right ventricular lead being pacemaker defibrillator.
While on the BMT service, we restarted her Gleevec at 400 mg daily but given as 4 100 mg pills rather than the larger 400 mg tablet, she was better able to tolerate the smaller pills.
Coumadin was initially held because of its interaction with Gleevec.
She was restarted on lasix and given IV diuresis over [**2-10**] - [**2-12**] with significant improvement with a return of her oxygen status to baseline.
However, upon repeat instance of asymptomatic, slow, sustained VT the next day, she was transferred to the CCU for further management of her VT.  CCU COURSE: In the CCU, the pt came in Vtach in the 130s (probably converting in the field) with pressures in the 90s/50s.
Amiodarone 100mg IV ONCE bolus plus 1mg/min drip x 6 hours, then 0.5mg/min bolus x 18 hours was started.
This was repleted immediately with K 10mg IV ONCE, and K 40mg PO ONCE and magnesium 4gm IV ONCE.
She remained hemodynamically stable (only has sx of palpitations) Lidocaine was started with a bolus then a drip with successful conversion.
Of note, pt had WBCs in urine and was started on ceftriaxone for UTI on [**2117-2-15**].
Lasix restarted [**2117-2-16**], and electrolytes checked twice daily thereafter without significant derangement.
She was instructed to continue with her new cardiac regimen of amiodarone and metoprolol, and follow-up with EP as an outpatient.
Her prior cardiac regiment included dofetolide, atenolol, digoxin and irbesartan.
Irbesartan was stopped secondary to renal failure on admission, and digoxin was stopped on transfer to CCU; these medications were not restarted on discharge, and should be discussed with outpatient cardiologist.
UTI: Patient was initially started on ceftriaxone, which was transitioned to oral cefpodoxime when species and sensitivities from urine culture returned.
The patient was instructed to complete a 7 day course of antibiotics to end on [**2117-2-22**].
Atrial Fibrillation: As noted above, patient had stopped dofetolide and was started on amiodarone during her course in the CCU.
Additionally, coumadin was stopped during her hospitalization and restarted several days prior to discharge.
The patient was instructed to take her dose of [**Name (NI) 99026**] prior to leaving on the day of discharge, but refused, stating that she would only take the medication at dinner time, when consuming a full dinner (this was not available at the time of discharge).
Consequently, she missed her dose of [**Name (NI) 99026**] on the day of discharge, but was given detailed instructions for obtaining and taking her medication thereafter.
