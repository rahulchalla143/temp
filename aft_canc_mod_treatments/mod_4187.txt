He was unable to tolerate POs, so he went to his local ED, where he was treated with IV fluids and discharged home with a prescription for anti-emetics.
Evaluation there revealed elevated LFTs with transaminases in the 300s, rising LDH to the 500s, new and enlarging frontal brain mets on head CT, and new lung mets on chest/abdominal CT.
He received Decadron 10 mg and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.
He is admitted for further care.
Pt has no prior h/o liver disease, although he endorses a previous "nicked bile duct" at the time of his nephrectomy in [**2133**].
He denies any recent acetaminophen or other ingestions, including prescription or recreational drugs, OTC meds, herbal meds, vitamin or hormone supplements.
Also endorses BLE swelling since stopping the Lasix he was prescribed after his pericardial window, and occasional epistaxis over the last 1-2 weeks, left > right.
At that time he underwent an ultrasound consistent with cholecystitis and also identification of a renal mass.
Subsequently, underwent a CT scan in roughly [**7-/2133**] showing a 7.5-cm mass in the lower pole of the right kidney, two other solid lesions in the right kidney as well.
- [**8-/2133**] He underwent cholecystectomy for his acute cholecystitis and roughly one month after cholecystectomy he underwent a right radical nephrectomy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 87423**], which was complicated by injury to the bile duct necessitating transfer to [**Hospital3 2358**] for bile duct repair, which was successful.
- [**2-/2134**] he presented with similar symptoms and was treated with prednisone and inhalers for a suspected possible asthma flare.
Biopsies confirmed the presence of metastatic clear cell renal cancer positive for napsin-A, vimentin and pan-keratin.

- [**2135-8-2**]: CT showed progressive disease - [**2135-8-9**] C1 sunitinib 50 mg PO daily 4 weeks on 2 weeks off, tolerated well with mild diarrhea only - [**2135-8-23**] C2 sunitinib 50 mg PO daily 4 weeks on 2 weeks off, tolerated well with mild diarrhea and mild neuopathy - [**2135-10-18**] CT torso with stable to decreased size of the numerous pleural-based metastases.

Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 48yo man with metastatic RCC s/p nephrectomy, previously on Sutent for brain, lung, and cardiac mets, s/p WBXRT and recent emergent pericardial window, initially presented with two weeks of nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weakness, found to have progressive disease and reaccumulation of pericardial effision s/p repeat window [**2136-2-20**].
#Pericardial effusion/tamponade s/p repeat window Large pericardial effusion seen on echo [**2-20**] with consideration for early tamponade.
Patient with previous pericardial window [**1-19**] with CT surgery.
On [**2-23**] the drainaige was minimal, so the drain was removed.
Significant oozing from site required holding anticoagulation and suture placement.
He was stable after suture placement without further oozing and restarted on enoxaparin and ASA.
He will continue gentle diureses every other day as outpatient for one week pending further evaluation by his primary oncology team in the outpatient setting.
Sutent discontinued as disease progression.On Lovenox and ASA for cardiac mass and prevention of thromboembolism.
These were held briefly for suture placement needed for oozing from his pericardial surgical wound.
For now plan is to hold all treatments and when stable he will return to clinic for further discussion of potential treatments if performance status improves.
# Right ventricular metastasis requiring anticoagulation: Enoxaparin & ASA held briefly for suture placement needed for oozing from his pericardial surgical wound.
Continued PRN anti-emetics with ativan.
Reglan and compazine held due to interaction with citalopram.
Minimal, covered by insulin sliding scale as an inpatient that was discontinued at discharge.
His labs indicate possible iron deficiency so will start on trial of Ferrex oral supplement daily as an outpatient.
