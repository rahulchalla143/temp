Admission Date:  [**2107-5-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-5-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2028-11-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP IR guided biliary drain placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 78 year old woman who lives in [**Hospital3 **] and referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for abdominal pain, weight loss, and jaundice.
Her symptoms started with bilateral, crampy lower quadrant abdominal pain and an increase in bowel movements without true diarrhea.
She underwnet a CT of the abdomen on [**2107-4-7**] in her area and revealed a double duct sign with dilation of the main PD to 4 mm along with dilation of the gallbladder.
Subsequently, she had MRCP on [**5-6**] that showed biliary and pancreatic ductal dilatation which appears to be due to compression or involvement by a 1.9 cm mass concerning for malignancy such as due to invasive neoplasm in the setting of side branch IPMN; partially cystic adenocarcinoma, or cholangiocarcinoma.
Today, [**5-10**], she underwent an unsuccessful attempt for an ERCP.
All remaining systems were reviewed and symptoms were negative.
Biliary and pancreatic ductal dilatation which appears to be due to compression or involvement by a 1.9-cm mass with non enhancing and hypoenhancing components and adjacent periductal hyperenhancement.
Others demonstrate both ring pattern of hyperenhancement and hypoenhancement and are concerning for metastasis although foci of infection could have a similar appearance.

LENI [**5-16**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT .
I spoke to her son, who wished for DNR and DNI status.
She would need IV fluid support, broad spectrum antibiotics aimed at biliary pathogens (E-coli and Enterococcus are the most important 2 pathogens), and discontinuation of her antihypertensive medications (except for Atenolol, gradual weaning unless she is frankly hypotensive or septic).
MICU treatment maybe indicated despite DNR/DNI wishes.
Further management will depend on family wishes and PTC.
*ICU COURSE* Pt was admitted from ERCP to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for continued monitoring given hypotension and pressor requirement during biliary drain placement concerning for post-procedure cholangitis.
She was weaned from Neo prior to arrival to floor however required multiple IVF boluses with 2L normal saline and 2L LR to maintain blood pressures >100 sbp.
R radial arterial line was placed to monitor MAP with goal >65.
CVL in R IJ placed for additional hemodynamic monitoring of CVP and volume resuscitation.
She was started on vasopressin with improvement in her pressures.
She was started on lasix gtt with tolerance from her BP and treated empirically for COPD exacerbation w steroids which was stopped after 2 days wo improvement.
She was trialed on bipap which she was only able to tolerate r a few hours before becoming very agitated overnight and self-dc'ing the apparatus.
She was placed back on NRB face mask.
Morphine IV was started for palliation of her dyspnea.
Lasix drip was continued with the hope that aggressive diuresis might improve her comfort given the extensive fluid collections noted on imaging.
On [**5-19**] she was made CMO, started on a morphine drip with ativan and all other non-comfort medications were discontinued.
Received multiple IVF boluses for resuscitation and pressure support with Vasopressin.
She was initially started on unasyn, flagyl, and cipro for biliary microbial coverage; however, preliminary bile cultures revealed gpc's in pairs, gnr, gnc and so antibiotics were changed to linezolid and zosyn for better coverage.
Linezolid was stopped after 7 days however zosyn was continued until the day she was made CMO and passed away.
s/p unsuccessful ERCP.
Biliary cultures as mentioned above grew pan-sensitive klebsiella.
Pain was treated with dilaudid and she was eventually transitioned to morphine drip when she was made CMO.
Initial family wishes were for IR guided drain placement with biopy/brushing to obtain official diagnosis and pathology however the pt's worsening respiratory issues prohibited this elective procedure.
CODE STATUS: confirmed w HCP/son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 89803**], initially DNR/Ok to intubate and changed to DNR/DNI.
Medications on Admission: Alendronate 70 mg tablets po every week Atenolol 75 mg po daily HCTZ 12.5 daily Aspirin 81 mg daily   Discharge Medications: Deceased  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic ca, unknown underlying primary but likely pancreatic fibrotic lung disease   Discharge Condition: Deceased  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after you had low blood pressure and an infection in your bile.
Interventional radiology placed a drain to relieve the obstruction.
You required high volume fluid resuscitation after the procedure for your low blood pressure.
We started you on a diuretic drip which took off excess fluid on your lungs.
