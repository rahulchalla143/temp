He is now day 27 status post a nonablative allogeneic transplant with Campath conditioning.
His recent admission was c/b febrile neutropenia (no source identified, treated empirically with vanc, cefepime, flagyl and caspo, then subsequently weaned off of these agents), anorexia requiring TPN, diarrhea (c. diff negative x6) and transiently elevated LFTs of unknown etiology (negative ultrasounds).

Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma: S/p Mini-MUDS w/ cells given on [**2168-5-3**].
Decadron and cyclosporin slowly weaned down.
Plan was for BM biopsy but patient refused.
Patient was given an additional dose of etoposide.
Fever: The patient had been febrile when neutropenic during his last admission and had been treated with cefepime (d/c'd [**5-19**]), flagyl, caspo, and Vanco (DC'd [**5-20**]), all of which were weaned as he defervesced.
Imaging, cultures and screens for c. diff were unrevealing and he had been transitioned to fluconazole, acyclovir and bactrim for prophylaxis.
He had one day of loose stools but this was in the context of taking stool softeners for constipation.
In addition to broad spectrum antibiotics, patient was treated with Foscarnet and one dose of Cidofovir.
Given decreased calcium, foscarnet was discontinued and patient was restarted on acyclovir for ppx as HHV-6 had cleared in the peripheral blood.
Patient then began spiking fevers on his last week of admission despite broad spectrum antibiotic medications including antifungal therapy.
Patient was given additional dose of etoposide as above, then began to refuse further treatment.
Bradycardia, prolonged QTC: Patient did have episode of torsades, though due to cyclosporine and fluconazole, respectively.
Was on TPN for the majority of his admission.
