He was admitted to the OMED service on [**5-16**] and begun on low dose heparin therapy.
Unfortunately his PTT rapidly climbed to 150 within 12 hours of starting heparin and remained at 150 all day of [**5-17**].

Oncologic history: Mr. [**Known lastname 13474**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy for a primary left calf melanoma in 9/[**2161**].
In [**8-/2164**], left inguinal node involvement as well as bilateral periaortic involvement were discovered on CT scan.
He was scheduled for a vaccine protocol, but we were unable to prepare vaccine from his disease.
In [**5-/2165**], he began on the ILEX-651 chemotherapy trial with shrinkage of target lesions, but there was concern for possible residual disease seen on PET scan.An attempt at biopsy of left inguinal lymph nodes showed no evidence of melanoma.
Another attempt at external iliac lymph node biopsy was made in [**5-/2168**] but it was inconclusive.
He stopped ILEX therapy in 5/[**2168**].
He then developed a soft tissue nodule on the medial edge of his pectoralis muscle that was FDG-avid on PET scan in 3/[**2169**].

He continues to wean off dexamethasone and is now on 1mg daily.
Coronary artery, aortic and aortic annulus calcifications.
DVT:  After discussion with neuro-onc, he was started on heparin GTT for anticoagulation given large clot burden.
