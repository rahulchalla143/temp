PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: ON DISCHARGE [**2171-8-16**] Gen: no acute distress CV: RRR, no murmurs Pulm: distant coars breath sounds in the R lung fields, clear breath sounds in the L lung fields Abd: soft, nontender, nondistended  Pertinent Results: PICC XRAY [**2171-8-14**] Uncomplicated ultrasound of fluoroscopically-guided single lumen PICC line placement via the right brachial venous approach.
CXR [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 84 year old woman s/p RUL lobectomy, now s/p bronchoscopy and PEG, repeat bronchoscopy for right lung collapse done.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Evaluate interval change SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST  REASON FOR EXAM: Followup right lung collapse, s/p right upper lobectomy.
Comparison is made with multiple prior studies including most recent one performed a day before at 1540 hours.
Lung right upper lobe, wedge resection (A-F): Squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated, see synoptic report.
Comments:  Lymph node with non-necrotizing granulomas.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted and taken to the OR on [**2171-7-19**] for Flexible bronchoscopy and right thoracoscopy, right thoracotomy, right upper lobectomy, and mediastinal lymph node dissection complicated by an avulsion injury to the posterior recurrent branch of the pulmonary artery which was repaired.
The pt's initial post operative course was complicated by ongoing respiratory compromise requiring re-intubation x2, BIPAP support and pulmonary tiolet via almost daily bronchoscopies for pulmonary tiolet.
Presently she is on vancomycin and meropenem (started [**8-11**] x 7days).
An open J-tube was placed [**8-9**] for feeding after pt failed bedside and video swallow.
Since this surgery, pt has had a complete white out of her right lung which has required daily bronchoscopies and aggressive pulmonary toilet with little to no improvement on CXR.
Pt has refused intubation and requested to be made DNI.
On [**2171-8-15**] she received a R US-guided chest tap by interventional pulmonology which yielded no fluid.
She is currently tolerating tube feeds via her J-tube.
