In the ED, she was found to have blood in her mouth, she was intubated for airway protection and had a central line placed.
She required phenylephrine briefly during intubation, but otherwise did not require any pressors.
Because of the blood in her mouth and OG was placed with return of coffee ground.
Her initial serum glucose was 900 and she was started on an insulin drip.
AN ECG was note to have some QRS widening (120) comparred to prior (100)  Upon review of previous notes in OMR, the patient intermitantly threatens noncompliance with her insulin therapy and has a length history of impulse control problems, for which she sees psychiatry.
Her last note indicates that she did agree to taking all of her prescribed medications, including her Tegretol and insulin.
She inappropriately and frequently calls her providers and it has been difficult in the past to get her to agree to medications that will control her chronic issues, with threatened section 12's to get her into the hospital for appropriate treatment.

Intubated patient, with the tip of endotracheal tube projecting 1 cm from the level of the carina, this should be withdrawn for appropriate positioning vs re-evaluated with chest radiograph.
[**12-1**] Endoscopy - Impression: (dilation, biopsy) Abnormal mucosa in the lower third of the esophagus (biopsy) Blood in the fundus Polyp in the fundus (polypectomy)Granularity and friability with shallow ulceration in the duodenal bulb (biopsy)Medium hiatal hernia Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum     Brief Hospital Course: 60F with lengthy psychiatric history with impulse control and difficult to control t2DM, now presenting with hypothermia, extreme hyperglycemia, and severe metabolic acidosis.
She was also aggressively volume resuscitated for what was presumed to be extreme hypovolemia and kept on an insulin gtt, with refractory glucoses requiring a gtt to up to 40 units per hour.
Intubation was done mostly for airway protection.
Due to persistent respiratory alkalosis, occasional difficulty with oxygenations, and volume overload after fluid resuscitation, she was slow to be extubated.
To address the anxiety component of extubation and her home dosing of clonazepam TID, she was started on dexmedetomidine (Precedex) to help transition to her home benzodiazepines.
Initially found to be hypothermic and covered broadly for sepsis with antibiotics and administered warm NS and Bair hugger,  resulting in improving temperatures within days of admission.
When her first course of antibiotics was nearly complete, her CXRs began to show suspicious findings for developing infiltrates, prompting a switch in her antibiotic course (Vanc/Zosyn --> Vanc/Cefepime).
difficile with Flagyl and PO Vancomycin, but toxins were negative and this course was stopped a few days later.
Her pressor requirement was slowly weaned as her fluid was mobilized >1 week into her hospitalization.
Given her poor urine output, minimally responsive to furosemide, and her continued respiratory requirements, a femoral dialysis line was placed (C-collar was still in place, preventing IJ placement) and she was started on CVVH.
She went for HD once with removal of fluid.
Given rising UOP, further dialysis was held until Cr peaked on [**2203-12-1**].
The temporary dialysis line was removed on [**2203-12-2**] and the patient will follow-up with nephrology for further evaluation.
After her initial insulin resistance with high-dose insulin drip, her blood glucose seemed to be better controlled with close monitoring.
Prior to her discharge from the ICU, she had been started on an insulin regimen closely resembling her home regimen with resulting hypoglycemia with minimal symptoms.
Her insulin regimen was adjusted such that she was placed on long acting with sliding scale only.
She will be discharged on her pre-admission dose as she is eating well and her kidney function is improving.
Following this procedure the patient reported being able to eat very well.
# ?unstable neck: [**Location (un) 2848**] J-collar was initially in place until the patient was extubated and able to verbalize her lack of pain was palpation of the C-spine.
GI bleed was treated initially with IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], but this was felt to be less likely and hematocrit were trended and stable.
