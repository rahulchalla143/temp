He was treated with diuretics for heart failure, placed on telemetry, electrolytes monitored, and had good UOP after an initially poor UOP.
The patient appeared to be doing well and then went into V Tach, V fib, and eventually died after a prolonged resuscitation attempt.
Mental Status change - The differential diagnosis of etiology of encephalopathic state was thought to include serotonin syndrome, underlying pneumonia and bacteremia and acute renal failure (consistent with asterixis).
The cultures turned out to be growing MRSE and vancomycin was continued.
SSRI was stopped to prevent worsening of seratonin state.
Ativan was initially used on the floor to sedate the patient when he was agitated/anxious, however this was held after one day as it was noted to increase his sedation/confusion.
As the patient diuresed, infection cleared, and meds were held, he became more oriented and more alert.
Severe TR and elevated R-sided pressures were thought to be from carcinoid heart.
On the floor, he was anxious initially and received ativan PRN initially.
He was diuresed with IV lasix at increasing doses with poor response.
The cardiology team was consulted and suggested initiation of IV hydral and nitrates.
By [**8-29**] he had reached that goal with fluid restriction in place.
A code blue was called and resuscitation was attempted unsuccessfully for over 30 minutes.
DDx was thought to include intravascular volume depletion, PE, and anxiety.
The patient was initially having BB held but was restarted on BB at low dose when tx to the floor.
After arriving on the floor, small amounts of lasix were given for diuresis with poor response.
There was a second peak in the creatinine as diuresis was increased and hydral/nitrates were added to the regimen.
Lactate was elevated, but decreased on a f/u with a venous lactate the next day.
DM2- The pt had known DM2 and was put on a diabetic diet and a sliding insulin scale with regular insulin.
[**Name (NI) 12329**] Pt was on beta blocker and lasix at home.
In the ICU, both were held for tachycardia of unknown etiology and proposed intravascular volume depletion, respectively.
BP was low in the unit and the pt received fluids for support.
By the time he was transferred to the floor, he was normotensive and was started on a BB for cardioprotection (low dose given heart failure).
Lasix was used to diurese and likely had little effect on BP.
Held beta blocker initially as above, and then restarted.
On Paxil as outpt, held as above secondary to possible serotonin syndrome.
Pt had been on medication long-term, however, he may have had increased serotonin in system if carcinoid has progressed.
He was on experimental protocols in past at [**Hospital1 112**].
He has been on octreotide as an outpatient and had stopped.
Restarting this treatment was considered, but the family declined.
The patient died after unsuccessful resuscitation for ventricular tachycardia that degenerated into ventricular fibrillation.
