Progression of lytic [**Month/Day/Year 500**] metastases as described above.
Interval increase in mediastinal caliber is probably due to venous engorgement, baseline widening due to extensive fat deposition and some lymph node enlargement.
Central catheter has been removed.

Brief Hospital Course: 61yo man with a recently diagnosed metastatic renal cell CA to brain s/p cyberknife, lung, and [**Month/Day/Year 500**] admitted for acute on chronic renal failure and hyperkalemia found on pre-op labs prior to debulking nephrectomy.
He was given 6L IV fluids, pip/tazo, and vancomycin for possible sepsis.
Because of hypoxia, heparin, then enoxaparin, were started for a possible PE, but CTA could not be done due to ARF.
Furosemide given for pulmonary edema and hypoxia, but then creatinine worsened, Nephrology consulted, and dialysis started [**2121-1-3**].
Othopedics recommended conservative management given co-morbidities.
Changed MSContin 15mg [**Hospital1 **] with PRN morphine to oxycodone PRN to avoid high plasma concentrations due to kidney failure per Nephrology and Pharmacy.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Initially improved with IV fluids and resolution of hypotension.
Returned back to baseline creatinine 1.8, but on the floor started to rise again after furosemide given for pulmonary edema.
Temporary dialysis cath placed [**2121-1-2**].
Tunnelled cath placed [**2121-1-10**].
Calcium acetate for hyperphosphatemia.
- Continue dialysis 3x per week.
# Altered mental status: Likely metabolic encephalopathy/acute delirium due to hypoxia and medications (lorazepam/narcotics).
- EEG [**2121-1-9**] results pending.
Required pressors in ICU.
Recurred after dialysis line placed [**2121-1-2**] (trigger for BP 78/47) and improved again with IV fluids.
Continued metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Able to only tolerate low doses of metoprolol due to hypotension.
Started amiodarone loading [**2121-1-8**].
Continued metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID.
Continued amiodarone loading 400mg [**Hospital1 **] x2-3 weeks, then 200-400mg daily.
Started low-dose aspirin (high risk for fall, therefore not a candidate for anticoagulation).
- Needs thyroid function tests and CXR in 2-3wks for amiodarone monitoring.
- EKG weekly x2 to follow QT interval while on amiodarone and sunitinib.
Emperically started on heparin gtt, then enoxaparin.
Furosemide 40mg IV x1 given [**2120-12-31**] with ensuing ARF.
Completed course of antibiotics for pneumonia.
O2 support as needed.
# Metastatic renal cell CA: s/p CNS cyberknife.
Continued levetiracetam 500mg PO BID seizure prophylaxis with extra half dose after dialysis.
# Microcytic anemia: Likely anemia of CKD and inflammation as based on iron studies, low retic index.
# Hypertension: Lisinopril held due to hypotension and ARF.
# DM: Glipizide held due to ARF, but as ARF resolved, glipizide was restarted, then stopped again with recurrent ARF.
# BPH: Stopped tamsulosin given low BP and anuria.
Stopped quetiapine and citalopram.
# Pain (humerus, abdomen): MSContin 15mg [**Hospital1 **] + morphine PRN changed to oxycodone PRN only to avoid rising plasma concentrations in kidney failure per Nephrology and Pharmacy.
# GI PPx: PPI and bowel regimen.
# DVT PPx: Heparin SC.

This was found on pre-op blood work in preparation for a nephrectomy for metastatic kidney cancer.
You were given medication to correct the high potassium level.
For these reasons, you were transferred to the ICU and given a large volume of IV fluids as well as metoprolol, which controlled the heart arrhythmia and returned it to normal.
For this, you were given furosemide, a diuretic, which temporarily improved your oxygen levels, but your kidneys did not tolerate this and worsened.
The kidney specialists were consulted and a dialysis line was placed.
Immediately after the dialysis line was placed, your blood pressure became dangerously low again, but this time it improved quickly with IV fluids.
This may have been due to very low oxygen levels and lorazepam, a medication given the night before for sleep/anxiety.
You started dialysis [**2121-1-3**] and were given a red blood cell transfusion the same day for severe anemia (low red blood cell count).
The fracture was partially caused by cancer in that [**Last Name (LF) 500**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] radiation therapy to the left arm was done.
You still require oxygen and prior to hospital discharge your pain regimen was changed in an effort to avoid morphine which can build up in your body when your kidneys are not working.
Morphine was changed to oxycodone only as needed.
Although oxycodone can also build up in the body, this is not as much as morphine.
The pain regimen may need to be adjusted in the future.
You were also started on viscous lidocaine to numb the mouth and artificial saliva (Gelclair) for mucositis.
Metoprolol 25mg 2x a day for atrial fibrillation.
Amiodarone 2x a day x2 weeks, then once daily for atrial fibrillation.
Oxycodone 5-10mg as needed for pain.
Stop lisinopril due to kidney disease.
Aspirin started for atrial fibrillation.
