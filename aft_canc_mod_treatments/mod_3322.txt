Admission Date:  [**2153-7-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-8-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2096-3-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: SVC Syndrome  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**7-18**] tracheal bronchial stent placement [**7-19**] Svc stent placement: 6mm and 8mm Stent placed   History of Present Illness: 57 year old male from [**State 1727**] with CAD s/p MI x2 ([**2135**], [**2143**]), ?COPD (on 2L home O2, 3ppd smoking for years), atrial flutter on coumadin, found to have new lung mass with recent onset of SVC syndrome, s/p bx at VA [**Location (un) 669**], now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for airway protection prior to initiation of XRT.
He was started on diltiazem and coumadin.
The patient was eventually transferred to the VA [**Location (un) 669**] for CT-guided biopsy given these unsuccessful attempts to make a diagnosis.
He was initially on the floor after admission on [**2153-7-3**] but transferred to the CCU b/o 6-8 seconds pauses after diltiazem, digoxin and atenolol given for treatment resistent atrial flutter with RVR in the 150s.
His coumadin was held for the biopsy and he was kept on a heparin drip.
His rate remained difficult to be controlled despite several treatment attempts.
His symptoms abated after CBB reversal and dopamine drip.
His course was c/b wheezing and SOB as well as increasing SVC syndrome with swelling of his face, both arms and ears.
He initially received a 5-day course of PO prednisone for wheezing but was switched to IV decadrone to reduce swelling from his SVC compression.
He was also started on azithromycin for post-obstructive PNA.
However, he was transferred eventually to [**Hospital1 18**] because of the concern for airway compromise during XRT.
He was transferred on Verapamil and Digoxin for rate control as well as a heparin drip.
Past Medical History: Hyperlipidemia CAD, s/p MI ([**2135**] + [**2143**]), each time s/p [**Name (NI) 73511**] PTSD Chronic LBP Depression Atrial flutter, on coumadin (as above) ?COPD   Social History: 150 pack year h/o smoking (quit 4 months ago b/o increasing dyspnea), occasional alcohol in the past, [**Doctor Last Name 360**] [**Location (un) 2452**] exposure in the past.
[**Hospital1 18**] STUDIES: CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2153-7-16**] 7:23 PM: Opacification of the right upper lung likely represents lung collapse due to proximal obstruction.
[**Numeric Identifier 73512**] EXTREM BILAT VENOGRAPHY  [**2153-7-19**] 8:54 AM Reason: stent placement in SVC Contrast: OPTIRAY PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: Informed consent was obtained from the patient explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure.
Using ultrasonographic guidance and a micropuncture sheath system, access was gained into the right basilic vein and a 0.018 guidewire and 5 Fr sheath was placed.
The vascular sheath was exchanged for a 5- French [**Last Name (un) 2493**] Tip sheath and a right subclavian venogram was then performed.
Using a combination of a 5- French Kumpe catheter and a 0.035 Glidewire, access was gained into the SVC and then distally into the inferior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance.
The Kumpe catheter was advanced all the way into the inferior vena cava and the Glidewire was exchanged for a 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name **] wire that was placed with tip in the inferior vena cava preserving access.
The 5- French Kumpe catheter was removed and then reinserted through the 7 Fr sheath alongside the [**Doctor Last Name **] wire.
This showed mixed retrograde and antegrade flow, with mild narrowing of the left brachiocephalic vein at its confluence with the right.The Kumpe catheter and a Bentson guidewire were then negotiated through the severely narrowed SVC into the right atrium.
A 10 mm x 4 cm PTA balloon was then advanced over the wire in order to partially dilate the SVC prior to stent placement.
A 14mm x 8 cm SMART stent was then placed in the right brachiocephalic vein, overlapping with the SVC stent.
This was followed by balloon dilation of the stent with a 12 mm balloon.
A 5-Fr straight Omniflush catheter was then placed with tip within the proximal upper stent.
Successful placement of two 14 mm SMART stents in the superior vena cava and right brachiocephalic vein, with good angiographic results on the final venogram.
Midline venous access with placement of right basilic triple lumen catheter with tip in the right axillary vein.
Review of immunohistochemical studies   performed at [**Location 1268**] [**Hospital1 65180**] shows positive staining of the tumor   cells with vimentin and CD68 and negative staining with desmin, actin,   smooth muscle actin, S-100, HMB-45, pankeratin and CD34.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 57 yo old male from [**State 1727**] with CAD s/p MI x2 ([**2135**], [**2143**]), ?COPD (on 2L home O2, 3ppd smoking for years), atrial flutter on coumadin, found to have new lung mass with recent onset of SVC syndrome, s/p bx at VA [**Location (un) 669**], transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for airway protection prior to initiation of XRT, now s/p bronch and y-stent placement by IP and SVC stent by IR.
# Increased dyspnea/wheezing: Patient was not aware of a diagnosis of COPD but had been on nebulizer treatments for several years, also on home oxygen.
Had also recently been started on formoterol and mom[**Name (NI) 6474**].
Pt presented with dypsnea and increased WOB that initially responded to diuresis with lasix, and then to albuterol nebs with heliox.
Pulmonary edema resolved with initial diuresis.
Pt continued to be wheezy, temporarily relieved with nebulizers and mucomyst and was treated with decadron.
Little improvement was made with XRT and above treatments and he demonstrated increased lethargy with CO2 retention.
The patient completed 9 cycles of XRT for palliation and was treated with morphine to make breathing comfortable as well as nebulizer treatments, mucomyst, scopalamine for secretions, supplemental oxygen, prednisone and ativan prn.
Tachycardia was not consistently responsive to maximum esmolol drip, oral betablocker, diltiazem, or IV lopressor, and rate management was complicated by hypotension.
Was initially switched to lovenox [**7-23**] for anticoagulation (had been difficult to get therapeutic on heparin) but anticoagulation was discontinued when he was made CMO.
He was kept on PO metoprolol and diltiazem for symptom relief, with the understanding that no IV lopressor would be given for heart rate control and no pressors would be given for hypotension.
The tumor obstructed the RUL so Y-stent was placed by IP, and SVC stent placed by IR.
# SVC syndrome: On presentation was severe with significant swelling of face, neck, and ears with bluish discoloration and dyspnea on exertion, now s/p IVC stent by IR on [**7-19**] with improvement in facial swelling and discoloration.
The patient was treated with decadron followed by prednisone and kept the head of his bed elevated to reduce swelling and prevent aspiration.
He was started on an NPH with insulin sliding scale which was titrated appropriately.
This was discontinued when he was made comfort measures only.
Patient was continued on ASA until he was made CMO.
- continue ASA .
Daily HCT's were checked and he was continued on Vitamin B12 and folate until he was made CMO.
He was afebrile and this was thought secondary to IV steroids.
Had been started on azithroycin at the VA, but antibiotics were discontinued here as no convincing signs of pneumonia were found.
# PTSD: Patient's anxiety was managed with prn Ativan, used cautiously due to tenuous respiratory status.
# Prophylaxis: The patient was initially maintained on a PPI and anticoagulation.
# Code Status: Code Status: DNR/DNI, comfort measures only.
