His hospital course by problem is as follows:  1) Left parietal hemorrhage- This was likely in the setting of supratherapeutic coumadin level.
An MRI with contrast was deffered given his renal insufficiency.
He was given proplex to reverse his anticoagulation, followed by 2 units of FFP.
He developed an acute episode of chest pain treated with nitrates, morphine and beta blocked.
He was restarted on full dose aspirin therapy for coronary and stroke prevention.
He was started on metoprolol but aspirin was not given as he had a large ICH.
He was started on a statin and his FLP was checked.
Second episode of chest pain on the floors managed medically with full dose atorvastatin, metoprolol, nitrates, and aspirin.
He likely has unstable coronary plaque with need for PCI, but cannot undergo intervention given his cerebral hemorrhage.
Maximum medical management, with narrow BP goals SBP 110-120 should be achieved.
The patient should follow up with either his primary cardiologist while at rehab or return for a follow up appointment with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 919**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 911**] at [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation in four weeks.

4) Bilateral Carotid Artery Stnnosis- Carotid US revealed 70-70% stenosis bilaterally.
He should remain on aspirin therapy.
