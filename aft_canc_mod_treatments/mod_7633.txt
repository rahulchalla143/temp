During a prior admission [**1-25**], she had a CT scan suggestive of fungal pneumonia with positive beta glucan and had BAL [**2130-1-26**] which grew Moraxella, MSSA, and Enterobacter treated with 21 day course of levofloxacin and started on voriconazole which was continued until this admission.
In clinic initially, oxygen saturation was 91% on room air and she complained of worsening cough productive of clear sputum and associated rhinorrhea and nasal congestion.
She received Pavilizumab for RSV and vori was initially changed to posaconazole then ambisome (first dose [**2130-2-28**]).

She was continued on Ambisome for fungal pneumonia, bactrim for stenotrophomonas although may be colonizer, Vancomycin and cefepime for bacterial HAP.
Diuresis was attempted with no improvement of her hypoxia.
She was eventually intubated, despite her family's wishes of her not to undergo intubation given the poor likelihood of a good outcome.
However, we could not terminally extubate given the patient's expressed wishes for intubation over several conversations over the past several days.
