[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/rna  DIAGNOSIS:  Rectal mass, mucosal biopsies:         Adenocarcinoma of the prostate involving the colonic mucosa; confirmed by immunopositivity for prostate specific antigen and prostate specific acid phosphatase.
Rectal mass lesion on previous sigmoidoscopy.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 81 caucasian Male with remote h/o prostate cancer s/p XRT and radiation-induced proctitis who is presenting with increasing abdominal bloating and distention.
He recently had a sigmoidoscopy with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 908**] on [**2183-8-11**] that showed: Abnormal mucosa up to 19cm, consistent with radiation proctitis; mass versus hypertrophic mucosa in the distal rectum.
This resolved with aggressive fluid resuscitation and 2U PRBC, and he was transferred back to the floor POD #2 ([**2183-9-7**]).
He was restarted on his antihypertensives when tolerating PO, and his BP remained around 130-140s systolic.
After consultation with cardiology, his aspirin was restarted [**2183-9-8**], and it was decided he no longer needed plavix.
GI: For his original constipation/impaction, pt was first tried with an aggressive bowel regimen with little improvement.
GI performed sigmoidoscopy on [**2183-9-5**] that showed almost completely obstructing mass in the rectum ~4cm from the anal verge.
Differential includes malignancy vs. severe inflammation and hyperplasia in the setting of radiation proctitis.
Colorectal surgery consulted and an ex-lap, right hemicolectomy, end ileostomy, descending loop colostomy, and rectal biopsy was performed on [**2183-9-5**].
He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the PACU in stable condition.
Upon discharge, he was at goal ileostomy output (between 500 and 1200cc/day), with gas in his ileostomy and colostomy bag.
He had a foley placed [**8-30**] with cystoscopy by urology.
The foley was cut accidentally in the OR and replaced without difficulty on [**2183-9-5**].
He again had increased Cr to 1.3 POD [**1-27**], but again resolved with hydration and has remained at baseline 1.0 with good UOP.
Rectal biopsy [**2183-9-5**] showed adenocarcinoma of the prostate involving the colonic mucosa; confirmed by immunopositivity for prostate specific antigen and prostate specific acid phosphatase.
The foley should remain until then.
He remained on tamsulosin 0.4 mg qd during his admission.
He now takes Mirtazapine 15mg at bedtime and duloxetine ER 60mg daily  Post-Surgical Complications During Inpatient Admission: [ ] Post-Operative Ileus resolving w/o NGT [ ] Post-Operative Ileus requiring management with NGT [ ] UTI [ ] Wound Infection [ ] Anastomotic Leak [ ] Staple Line Bleed [ ] Congestive Heart failure [ ] ARF [ ] Acute Urinary retention, failure to void after Foley D/C'd [ ] Acute Urinary Retention requiring discharge with Foley Catheter [ ] DVT [ ] Pneumonia [ ] Abscess [x] None  Social Issues Causing a Delay in Discharge: [ ] Delay in organization of VNA services [ ] Difficulty finding appropriate rehabilitation hospital disposition.

If you are taking narcotic pain medications there is a risk that you will have some constipation.
If you have any of the following symptoms please call the office for advice or go to the emergency room if severe: increasing abdominal distension, increasing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids, prolonged loose stool, or constipation.
This incision can be left open to air or covered with a dry sterile gauze dressing if the staples become irritated from clothing.
