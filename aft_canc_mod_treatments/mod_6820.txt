PNA so reportedly treated with antibiotics x10d.
Also rx with lasix for the last 3d.
She was started on heparin gtt with bolus and sent here for management.
Heparin was on hold for PTT 131.
We treated her with heparin gtt and she remained hemodynamically stable.
She should remain on lovenox [**Hospital1 **].
She was initiated on coumadin but was unable to take oral medications consistently with the nursing staff, so it was felt that it would be safer with the clot burden to continue Lovenox therapy for life.
The risks of anticoagulation with a head lesion were discussed with her family, and she was anticoagulated despite bleeding risk because of the high risk of hemodynamic collapse from her pulmonary embolus.
A discussion about further management in case of further decompensation was conducted with multiple family members present, with goal to transition to a morphine drip if necessary.
