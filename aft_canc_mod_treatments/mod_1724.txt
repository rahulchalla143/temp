Admission Date:  [**2150-5-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-5-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-7-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 28994**] Chief Complaint: Fevers, tachycardia, tachypnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 28983**] is a 65 year old man with a history of CLL and pulmonary embolus.
He has been off of treatment for his CLL secondary to complications from the chemotherapy.
He has required frequent transfusions for his anemia (last transfusion of 2 units of pRBC's on [**5-21**]).
He is neutropenic and has been on valacyclovir, pentamidine, and voriconazole.
He did not take any medication for the cough and it was not made better or worse by anything that he noticed.
He was started on Augmentin and azithromycin.
He took Motrin and drove back from [**Location (un) **] to his regular home.
He was given a total of 2 L of normal saline and 1000 mg of acetaminophen.
His respiratory rate increased to the 30's, but improved after treatment with a nebulizer.
After discussion with the onc fellow, the patient was started on vancomycin and cefepime.
His antifungal coverage was not increased.
Afterwards he developed on ongoing cough that was improved with guafenesin and a nebulizer.
In [**2143**], he had recurrence of a cutaneous eruption involving the right cheek, but evaluation was felt inconsistent with recurrent herpes zoster and biopsies supported a clonal low-grade B-cell lymphoproliferation, perhaps "marginal zone B-cell lymphoma," reviewed by dermatologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 28984**] at [**Hospital1 112**].
On evaluation by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Company 2860**], concern was raised regarding transformation of his CLL, and repeat torso CT scan was obtained on [**2145-6-3**], showing interval increase in some but not all areas of lymphadenopathy, as summarized in my [**2146-2-25**] note.
However, subsequent evaluation by infectious disease specialist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1059**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1057**] at [**Hospital1 18**] disclosed erlichiosis, and therapy with doxycycline was begun.
Peripheral blood FISH analysis on CLL cells was obtained showing abnormalities for the D13S319 13q14.3 and P53 17p13.1 probes in 4/100 and 70/100 nuclei, respectively.
Admitted to hospital on [**2146-4-27**], he ultimately underwent placement of a pericardial window, with drainage of left pleural and pericardial fluid, both showing CLL cells.
Of note, convalescent serum samples subsequently returned showing a rise in [**Location (un) **] B5 antibody to a level of 32.
On [**2146-10-24**], when peripheral blood lymphocytes declined below 50K, he received his first dose of Rituxin, given over 2 days.
Further therapy with Fludara/Cytoxan was held due to persistent thrombocytopenia.
On [**2146-11-1**], with persistent thrombocytopenia, he began weekly Rituxin X 4 with vincristine and prednisone 100 mg daily x5 added to Rituxin on [**2146-11-8**], followed by prednisone taper for presumed ITP.
Full-dose cycle 3 FCR was administered on days 1 through 3 beginning [**2147-1-17**].
(10)Due to worsening anemia and thrombocytopenia thought to be secondary to ITP as well as bone marrow involvement with CLL, he received a pulse of high-dose dexamethasone at the beginning of [**9-12**] with 4 doses of weekly rituximab and weekly vincristine on weeks 2 through 4 ([**2147-9-14**] through [**2147-10-5**]).
On [**2147-9-21**], he began daily prednisone instead of dexamethasone pulsing.
(13) On [**2148-10-10**], with worsened severe thrombocytopenia attributed to ITP complicating progressive CLL, he resumed prednisone 1 mg/kg = 80 mg daily.
14) From [**10-18**] to [**2148-10-20**], he recieved cycle 1 cyclophosphamide plus 7 days dexamethasone (in lieu of prednisone).
With persistent neutropenia, he received 4 weekly doses of rituximab in [**11/2148**] and again in [**12/2148**], ending on [**2149-1-1**].
Prednisone was resumed for ITP following hi-dose pulsed dexamethasone, and prednisone dosing has been tapered slowly.
On [**2149-3-3**], repeat chest CT showed marked improvement with near complete resolution of ground glass lung opacities, prompting infectious disease specialist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] to discontinue voriconazole therapy for aspergillosis.
(15) Began RCD chemotherapy on [**2149-4-29**] for progressive thrombocytopenia, anemia, lymphadenopathy and neutropenia.
(16) After four cycles of RCD chemotherapy, anemia and thrombocytopenia improved, and lymphadenopathy resolved.
Decision made to hold off on further cycles due to prolonged leukopenia and increasing fatigue.

He was broadly covered for bacterial pathogens with vancomycin and cefepime.
He had been on voriconazole prophylaxis prior to admission which was expanded to ambisome for fungal coverage.
He had a history of erlichia and was started empirically on doxycycline as he had spent time on [**Hospital3 **] this season.
His blood and urine was cultured, and beta glucan and galactomanan were assayed.
He briefly tried non-invasive BiPAP mask ventilation for comfort the morning after his arrival, though this measure was poorly tolerated.
After discussing with his family, he elected to focus his goals of care on comfort only.
His antibiotics were discontinued.
He was placed on a morphine drip and his respiratory distress was alleviated.
