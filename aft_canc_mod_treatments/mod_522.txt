U/A neg but [**Date Range **] culture + proteus, treated CAP with levofloxacin, and proteus was sensitive to that as well.
Continued home lactulose 30mg PO TID and 30mg PO Q4H  and rifaximin 550mg [**Hospital1 **].
Encephalopathy cleared on lactulose and rifamixin over the course of the hospital stay.
Patient was discussed and tumor board and was approved to be placed on transplant list.
Transplant surgery was following.
Initially, diuretics (lasix and spironolactone) were held in setting of [**Last Name (un) **] as below.
However, given hepatic encephalopathy was likely related to infection, treated for CAP with levofloxacin 750mg Q48h x 5 days (last day [**6-11**]) .
This was sensitive to levofloxacin which was already being used to treat CAP as above.
# Acute on chronic kidney injury: Patient has chronic renal insufficiency with baseline Cr ~1.5-1.7.
However, did not respond to albumin challenge x2 days, Cr continued to rise.
Started ocreotide and midodrine for HRS on [**6-12**], albumin was also given daily.
Because the edema would not resolve with diuretics, Lasix 80mg daily was started with the understanding that the patient's renal function would likely deteriorate and HD would be required.
On [**6-18**] an HD catheter was placed and dialysis was started on [**6-19**].
He was discharged on HD on a T/TH/SA scheduled to be continued at an out patient dialysis center.
Dicloxacillin [**Hospital1 **] was continued for suppression.
It was treated with vancomycin, dosed by daily troughs, for 5 days.
