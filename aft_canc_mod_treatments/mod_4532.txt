His symptoms were attributed to parkinson's dx and his dose of sinemet was increased.
His exam was notable for poor attention and confusion with initial labs revealing leukocytosis to 24.9 with grossly positive U/A.
Due to recent seizure activity, he was placed in a c- collar and cleared with a CT c-spine with clinical exam.

Tonic-Clonic Seizures: On admission there was report of a history of seizure disorder with recent witnessed epileptic activity in setting of likely infection and medication known to lower seizure threshold.
The patient was admitted to the ICU and started on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis by neurology recommendations and his antibiotic was changed to Ceftriaxone.
The patient clearly expressed the risks of not pursuing any further evaluation or treatment and was willing to accept the consequences.
The patient was discharged on Keppra 500 mg twice a day for seizure prophylaxis which was the dose started on admissionto [**Hospital1 18**].
Vascular surgery was again contact[**Name (NI) **] and an IVC filter was placed without complication.
Vascular surgery reported that this patient would not be a candidate for IVC filter removal and that no follow-up was necessary.
Urinary Tract Infection: The patient was admitted two days into a course of Ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection that was culture positive for Citrobacter, which was pan-sensitive.
Given the neurological complications associated with Ciprofloxacin in the elderly, the patient was switched to Ceftriaxone.
The patient completed a total of 10 days of antibiotics (from the start of the Ciprofloxacin) as an inpatient.
Of note, the patient was transferred to the medicine service with a foley in place but was discontinued.
The patient subsequently failed to void, was started on Tamsulosin for presumed BPH and the foley was replaced.
Aspiration Risk: The patient was evaluated by speech and swallow in the ICU and was started on a dysphagia diet and nectar-thickened liquids due to high aspiration risk.
Parkinson's Disease: The patient was admitted on Sinemet for his Parkinson's disease of unknown duration.
The patient was continued on his Sinement during this hospitalization without problem.
Given that the patient was already on a third generation cephalosporin and clinical suspicion was low for another infectious process, no additional antibiotic coverage was added.
The patient received vigorous hydration in the ICU prior to transfer to the medicine floor and his hematocrit declined to 32.8 at time of transfer to the medicine service.
Given his poor oral intake, the patient was continued on intermittent fluids on the floor.
Iron studies were ordered and were consistent with anemia of chronic disease (calTIBC 142, Ferritin 894, TRF 109) which was consistent with the patient's underlying disease process.

Although you do not want to have treatment of your tumors, you have been given medication to help prevent the seizures that the tumors are likely causing.
Also, on admission to the hospital you were being treated for a urinary tract infection with an antibiotic called Ciprofloxacin.
As this medication can be associated with neurological side-effects in elderly individuals, you were changed to another antibiotic called Ceftriaxone.
Start Keppra 500 mg by mouth twice a day, in the morning and in the evening.
This medication will help prevent seizures.
Start Vitamin D 400 unit tablet.
Start Calcium carbonate 500 mg tablet.
