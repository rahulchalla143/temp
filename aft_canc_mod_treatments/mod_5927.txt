Her hospital course is as follows:  *Small Bowel Obstruction: Given that Ms. [**Known lastname 1305**] was initially hemodynamically stable with a soft abdomen, surgical management was deferred.
A nasogastric tube was placed for conservative management of her symptoms.
She was made NPO and received intravenous fluids, scheduled anti-emetics, and IV Dilaudid & Ativan prn.
Ms. [**Known lastname 1305**] was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole in order to broadly cover possible intrabdominal process and/or aspiration pneumonia.
Her nasogastric tube was subsequently clamped and discontinued.
*) Cardiovascular  : Ms. [**Known lastname **] home Lisinopril was initially held while NPO and restarted on day of discharge.
She was given IV hydralazine as needed for blood pressure spikes.
*) Pulmonary  : Following the desaturation on room air as noted above, Ms. [**Known lastname 1305**] was initially placed on 2L nasal canula and was easily weaned to room air prior to transfer back to the floor.
*) Renal: A foley catheter was placed during her SICU stay, with adequate urine output throughout her stay.
*) Hematology: During the acute episode on hospital day #2, Ms. [**Known lastname 1305**] was noted to have a hematocrit drop from 29.9 to 23.1 She was given 2 units of packed red blood cells in the SICU, with a subsequent improvement in hematocrit to 32.
*) Endocrine: Prior to admission, Ms. [**Known lastname 1305**] was taking 15 mg prednisone daily as prescribed by her oncologist for oral mucosal lesions.
As she was steroid dependent on admission and given her acute medical status, she was initially given 2 doses of stress steroids intravenously ( IV dexamethasone 10' [**7-18**] -> [**7-19**] IV hydrocortisone 100).
She was then placed on IV hydrocortisone 20 every 8 hours (equivalent to home prednisone dose) for maintenance.
She was transitioned to PO Prednisone 10mg when she started tolerating a regular diet.
*) Oncology: Per Ms. [**Known lastname **] primary medical oncology team, she is still eligible for the current clinical trial she is enrolled in for cisplatin vs. olaparib in advanced solid tumors.
*) Prophylaxis: Ms. [**Known lastname 1305**] was given subcutaneous heparin and pneumatic boots.
