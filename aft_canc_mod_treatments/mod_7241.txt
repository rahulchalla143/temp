Admission Date:  [**2169-8-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2169-9-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2098-6-23**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old white male with a history of double vision and stinging of the eyes times approximately one month and a past medical history significant for renal cell carcinoma approximately 20 years ago (for which he underwent an nephrectomy on the left side in [**2147**]).
He is a nonsmoker with a negative alcohol history, who also is status post cholecystectomy in [**2148**].
HOSPITAL COURSE:   Due to the clinical findings the patient was admitted to the hospital on the morning of [**2169-8-16**]; at which time he was taken to the operating room where he underwent a transcallosal craniotomy for excision of a third ventricle tumor which was found on preoperative studies.
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for postoperative management.
Therefore, he spent the next several days in the Intensive Care Unit for management of aspiration and related complications.
Eventually, the decision was made to consider do not resuscitate/do not intubate orders due to the patient's lack of clinical progress after several more days in the Intensive Care Unit, and the gradual realization that his neurologic condition would not improve subsequently and he would not return to normal function or to his preoperative status, and that it would be against his wishes to continue to maintain intubation and further aggressive care in light of the prognosis and diagnosis.
He remained on comfort measures and supportive care throughout the remainder of his hospitalization, and the patient subsequently was found to be deceased at 2:05 a.m. on [**2169-9-13**] with no evidence of pupillary reaction.
