The patiet was admitted on [**2138-7-31**] for segmental resection of the segment VII liver mass, as he was not a candidate for liver transplant due to his continued alcohol abuse.
The patient was taken to the OR on [**2138-8-1**] for a planned segmental resection and cholecystectomy.
The patient experienced some periods of hypotension during the case which responded to volume and Neo-Synephrine.
He received 7 units of fresh frozen plasma, 17 units of packed red cells, three 6 packs of platelets, and 2 units of cryoprecipitate intra-operatively, but otherwise tolerated the procedure well and was transferred from the OR to surgical ICU in stable condition intubated and sedated with 2 JP drains in place in the R. abdomem.
Post-operatively the patient was successfully transitioned to CPAP within 3 hours of surgery and extubated on the following day.
On post-operative day 1 he received transfusions of another 2 units of PRBCs for a hematocrit of 23.6  On post-operative day 3 the patient had a fever to 101 with chest X-ray that failed to demonstrate focal pneumonia.
High out-put of peritoneal fluid was also noted from his JP drains, medial > lateral which was repleted with IV fluids and albumin (begun on a regimen of 25mg of albumin q8hrs) to increase oncotic pressure within the vasculature.
The patient's lateral JP drain continued to have minimal output while the medial JP drain continued to have high output of acetic fluid (several liters per 24hrs).
On post-operative day 11 the patient was tolerating a regular diet and the lateral JP drain was removed with no significant increase in output from the medial JP, although immediately prior to removal of the drain the patient was noted to have some drainage of acetic fluid from his incision.
Ciprofloxacin 500mg daily was begun for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis.
Drainage of acetic fluid and urine output was drastically improved with regimen of 40mg Lasix IV twice daily and 25mg 25% IV albumin q8hrs.
This was addressed with aggrssive chest physical therapy and incentive spirometry/ambulation.
The patient's edema/swelling returned to baseline with acetic fluid output decreased to less than 250cc/24hrs and on post-operative day 18 the medial JP drain was removed without any notable increase in drainage from the incision.
The following day the patient's creatnine was noted to abruptly increase (from 0.7 to 1.6) with hypotensive episodes to systolic blood pressures <90mmHg following Lasix/Aldactone administration and accompanying tachycardia.
Due to concern for hemoconcentration diuretics were temporarily discontinued and the patient was given 25mg of albumin with good response.
Urine electrolytes were obtained, with FeNa+ calculated to be 1.2% (pre-renal) and the patient was re-started on fluids and albumin 25% TID.
The following day (hospital day 22) the patient's clinical picture again deteriorated as he began complaining of increasing shortness of breath despite multiple nebulizer treatments.
The patient was transferred to the SICU for further management of likely hepatic hydro-thorax, and underwent thoracentesis with removal of 3.2L of fluid that did not demonstrate any microorganism growth on culture or in gram stain.
As the patient was refusing further thoracenteses at the time, remained asymptomatic, and given the risks associated with repeated thoracentesis, both the primary team and interventional pulmonology team agreed that it would be in the patient's best interests to manage conservatively with diuretics and reserve thoracentesis for only when the patient became symptomatic.
The patient was re-started on Aldactone 100mg daily, and transferred out of the ICU on hospital day 24.
He was re-started on Lasix at a dose of 40mg [**Hospital1 **] upon improvement of his Cr.
Despite the increase in diuretics, the patient's R. pleural effusion persisted although the patient continued to remain asymptomatic and oxygen saturations were 94-98% at baseline.
The patient did well following these adjustments and will continue to be followed as an outpatient.
Seroquel was decreased prior to discharge for excessive somolence  On hospital day 32 discussion between the hepatobiliary surgical and medical teams concluded in the decision to proceed with TIPS as the patient's hepatic hydrothorax was failing to demonstrate any improvement with conservative management and his renal function was not tolerant of higher doses of diuretic therapy.
Chest tubes were placed and continued to drain postoperatively for 2 days at which time thoracic surgery decided to attempt doxycycline pleurodesis.
Chest tube drainage decreased over the following 2 days and they were removed without significant accumulation of fluid or oxygen requirement.
Patient also suffered a significant ileus at this time with associated mental status changes thought to be associated with hepatic encephalopathy and was placed NPO with ivf support and bowel rest for 3 days.
When patient was having flatus milk of magnesium was adminstered along with lactulose enemas and when patient was having bowel movements, po lactulose was restared and tolerated well with significant improvment in mental status.
