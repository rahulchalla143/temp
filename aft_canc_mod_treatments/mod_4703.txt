Brief Hospital Course: [**2181-7-5**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], Robot-assisted laparoscopic cystoprostatectomy, bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection, and ileal conduit urinary diversion  Patient was admitted to Urology after undergoing Robot-assisted laparoscopic cystoprostatectomy, bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection, and ileal conduit urinary diversion.
The patient received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis.
On POD#3, his pain was controlled with IV pain medications and he was eventually transitioned to PO pain medications as his diet was advanced over the next several days.
By POD6 he was adavanced to a house diet, was ambulating out of bed, and his stents were d/c??????d.
He was started on fluconazole.
Right percutaneous nephrostomy catheter placement.
A foley placed, but no change was observed.
Therefore, lasix was administered with good result.
Exploratory laparotomy, drainage of fungal abcess and urine in   peritoneum 2.
Revision of ureteroileal anastomosis on the left and a     reinforcement of the anastomosis on the right.
Endoscopic exam of inside of ileal loop, placement of bilateral     ileal conduit to ureter to kidney stents.
Pod9/1 - 19/11 He initially did wwell postoperatively, however he continued again to have increasing output from his JP over the next 10 days despite the revised anastomoses.
Numerous gentle manipulations of the stents were performed in the urostomy to faciliatate urostomy drainage, without success.
He was started on [**Hospital1 **] PPI, milk of magnesia, and sucralfate, and all medications that could increase the propensity to bleed were stopped.
He recieved 4U pRBC over this time, and his stools eventually normalized and his hematocrit stabilized without further need for blood.
Nutrition was consulted, and the nutrition team rec placement of a PICC line and starting TPN.
He received TPN for ~1.5 weeks while we encourgaed PO and provided nutritional supplements.
Phsyical therapy followed and helped with ambulation.
Our ostomy nurse helped him with wound and ostomy care.
After receioving TPN for approximately 6 days, his LFTs were noted to slowly rise and were carefully monitored.
POD21/13/1 - 24/16/4 - His LFT's continued to rise despite all hepatotoxic medications being d/c'd.
They continued to remain elevated even as TPN was weaned to off.
Our infectious disease team was again consulted and fluconaczole was switched to micafungin, also to reduce hepatotoxicity.
The infectious disease service reccomended that Unasyn was added to micafungin.
Per infectious disease, Ciprofloxacin was added to treat the proteus infection, to which it was sensitive.
His JP drain output also remained low (~100-200 cc per day).
Test of the JP fluid for creatinine on the day of discharge was still consistent with urine (16.9), so the decision was made to d/c him to rehab with the JP drain in place.
Consultation of the hepatobiliary service for his elevated liver enzymes resulted in paracentesis and drainage of ~750cc of ascitic fluid.
He was having good urostomy and b/l nephrostomy output.
His lower wound had been opened (~2 inches at the inferior aspect of the wound, and was being packed wet to dry with saline soaked guaze twice a day,a nd remained free of purulent exudate or erythema.
