Brief Hospital Course: 78 y/o male with a history of psychiatric disorder NOS with catatonia, HCC, HCV/cirrhosis, and prostate cancer who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress  # Tachypnea: The patient was admitted to the MICU with tachypnea.
Other diagnosis on the differential included infection vs PE.
The patient was stable on room air throughout his ICU course and his tachypnea was resolved by the end of HD#1.
T  #Enteroccocus UTI- The patient was  treated with a  7 day course of ampicillin  # Nutrition- The patient had a bedside speech and swallow evaluation on [**10-10**] and was  recommended patient to be NPO for prevention of prandial aspiration.
Re-evaluation  on [**10-13**] recommended continued NPO status except for meds crushed in purees.
The patient initially had difficulty  with medications PO, with noted improvement in ability to tolerate PO medications as the hospital course progressed.
He was tried on a diet of nectar thickened liquids and pureed solids on [**10-17**].
The patient was maintained on aspiration precautions during his hospital course, and these precautions should be continued on discharge  # Psychiatric disorder NOS: On admission the patient was intermittently agitated and catatonic.
Acute agitation responded well to ativan in the ED.
While there he was placed on 4 point restraints although these were discontinued in the ICU.
He tolerated placement of IVs, and  engaging in conversation.
He was evaluated by psychiatry and found  no clear indication for psychotropic medication at this time (aside from low dose benzodiazepine) and that it is unlikley that  antipsychotic medication would provide significant benefit, either for pt comfort or to facilitate care.
# HCC/HCV/Cirrhosis/Ascites:  The patient was diagnosed with a 3.8 cm ruptured HCC with subsequent massive hemoperitoneum s/p resection ([**11/2175**])  and likely recurrence of HCC as evidenced on right upper quadrant ultrasound.
Diagnostic testing to confirm this would not be helpful given this would not impact therapy and biopsy could precipitate fatal hemorrhage or rupture.
He was conservatively managed with lactulose to prevent hepatic encephalopathy and spironalactone and lasix for diuresis.
Cytology was also negative for malignant cells The patient also under went a therapeutic paracentesis by Interventional radiology, and had 3 L removed, without complication.
The patient should have outpatient follow up in Liver clinic for medication management, and may intermittently need therapeutic paracentesis.
