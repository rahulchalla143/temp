3 leaflet native aortic valve with normal movement , now with 1+ AI.
Ascending aortic graft without leak or visible dissection.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was brought emergently to the Operating Room on [**2163-5-27**] for type A dissection, after initial assessment he underwent emergent Ascending aortic/hemi-arch aorta replacement with 30-mm Gelweave graft and resuspension of the aortic valve.
He tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
He was supported with pressors in the immediate post-op period, initial attempts to wake and wean from ventilator failed due to hypoxia, his post-op CXR was wet and he required additional diuresis prior to extubation.
during subsequent attempts to wean from ventilator he developed atrial fibrillation, he converted to sinus rhythm with amiodarone and Bblockers.
He was extubated on POD 3, after which he experienced post-op delerium, which improved with Haldol and  discontinuation of narcotics.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD eight the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing, pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
