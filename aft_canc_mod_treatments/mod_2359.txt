After discussions with medical oncology and urology attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], it was determined that the patient would undergo a left radical nephrectomy with excision of the tumor thrombus in the vena cava as well as a perirenal lymph node dissection.
On [**11-24**], the patient went to the operating room and an uncomplicated left radical nephrectomy with a left renal vein tumor thrombectomy as well as a left periaortic lymph node dissection.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the Postanesthesia Care Unit intubated, in stable condition.
The patient's postoperative course was relatively uneventful with the exception of a transient elevation of her bilirubin thought to be secondary to a transfusion reaction from the 8 units of packed red blood cells that she received during the operative procedure.
The Pain Service came up with a regimen of a Fentanyl patch with the addition or oral Dilaudid for breakthrough pain as her outpatient regimen.
The patient's pathology report subsequently revealed renal cell carcinoma (a clear-cell type, grade III) demonstrating invasion through the capsule into the perinephric fat with venous invasion; 0/2 perihilar nodes were positive for malignancy; [**3-14**] periaortic nodes were positive for malignancy.
Fentanyl patch 25-mcg q.72h.
Dilaudid 2 mg to 4 mg p.o.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Renal cell carcinoma of the left kidney with tumor thrombus into the vena cava, status post left radical nephrectomy and left renal vein thrombectomy.
