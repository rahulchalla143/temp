Mr. [**Known lastname 19862**] completed chemoradiation which allowed him to eat better and gain approximately 10 pounds.
J tube in place.
Dressing on right chest where chest tube was formerlhy inserted is c/d/i.
[**2181-7-6**] 8:49AM New right middle lobe opacity on the lateral view which is likely atelectasis but should be watched on subsequent studies to exclude developing pneumonia.Stable moderate left and small right pleural effusions.
The patient was in the ICU afterwards because of a collapsed right lung with oxygen desaturation.
This required a right chest tube to be inserted in addition to the black drain he already had on that side.
Additionally the patient developed atrial fibrillation in the ICU that was controlled with amiodarone and metoprolol.
As his oxygen saturation improved in the ICU he was transferred to the floor NPO, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter.
His course on the floor was as follows:  Neuro: The patient received oxycodone with good effect and adequate pain control.
When tolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.
He was continued on amiodarone and metoprolol.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.He arrived to the floor with a JP drain and a chest tube to water suction.
One chest tube had an air leak and required pleurodesis.
The patient tolerated this procedure well.
In the following days the chest tube no longer had an air leak and both chest tubes were removed.
GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV fluids.
He was started on tube feeds, and diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well tolerated.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.
