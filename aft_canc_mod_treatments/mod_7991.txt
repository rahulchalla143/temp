She further underwent rigid flexible bronchoscopy of the left upper lobe on [**2119-3-10**] with cryodebridement and balloon dilation, along with therapeutic aspiration of secretions.
Residual 50% LUL proper obstruction, 80% lingular obstruction.

IR procedure [**4-12**]: IMPRESSION: Unsuccessful cannulation of bronchial arteries due to extreme angles at their origins.
The left subclavian line tip is at the level of mid SVC.
Left IJ catheter extends to the cavoatrial junction or possibly the upper portion of the right atrium.

precarinal lymph node, left hilar nodal mass, upper lobe anterior segment nodule, right lung apex nodule).
She was intubated with double lumen tube and eventually ventilated with double ventilators (AC on right and PCV on left) with some recruitment (FiO2 decr to 50%).
She underwent debridment and electrocautery of LUL bronchus, which was opened, no active bleeding, but notable for old clots.
Upon ventilation, of Left lung s/p electrocatery and debridement, significant recruitment was achieved.
She was started on Vancomycin/Cefepime ([**4-13**]) for post obstructive PNA and Flagyl was added [**4-14**].
With aggressvie volume resuscitation, UOP improved as did her pressures.
Frank purulence was visualized on bronchoscopy as above.
Although her bronchial washings grew commensal flora only (2 days on ABx), treatment was continued due to clinical presentation consistent w/ PNA.
Did not tolerate BiPAP but responded well to IV lasix.
On the floor, she continued to improve, with intermittent nebulizer treatments for wheezing on exam.
She was started on a prednisone taper for laryngeal edema [**2-23**] intubation.
Noted grade III subglottic edema during ETT exchange on [**4-14**] w/ IP.
Received IV solumedrol in OR.
On [**4-15**] post extubated, was found to have signifiant stridor, received racemic epinephrine and additional dose of IV solumedrol.
Improved with aggressive hydration to 1.0. .
She was started on lisinopril and amlodipine, w/ close PCP f/u, given that her prednisone will be tapered and expect her HTN to come down from that alone.

For this, you were intubated, and had a procedure done to stop the bleeding.
Measure your blood pressure daily (buy a blood pressure cuff at your pharamcy).
Stop lisinopril and amlodipine (blood pressure meds) if the top number is less than 100.
The following changes were made to your medications ** START prednisone taper [steroid] ** START levoquin [antibiotic].
Take tonight, and then 3 times (every 8 hours) tomorrow ** START lisinopril [blood pressure medication] ** START amlodipine [blood pressure medication]   Followup Instructions: Name: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD Specialty: Hematology/Oncology Location: [**Hospital1 18**] - DIVISION OF HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY Address: [**Apartment Address(1) 85559**], [**Location (un) **],[**Numeric Identifier 718**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13016**] We are working on a follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the next week.
