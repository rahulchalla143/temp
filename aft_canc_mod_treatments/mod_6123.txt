Due to prohibitive surgical risk, the pt underwent an endovascular aneurysm repair with bilateral groin cutdowns on emergent basis on [**2166-10-14**].
BP during the procedure was initially 90-100s over 40-50s (one value to 80/40) then 110/80s.
He required fluid boluses and prbc as well as albumin.
Avoidance of all nephrotoxins was advised as well as keeping MAP >65.
Status post aortobifemoral graft with no interval change in the size of extensive right retroperitoneal hematoma.
On [**10-22**], hepatobiliary surgery was reconsulted for concerns for obstruction as he had abdominal pain and distention since [**2166-10-16**] without BM.
The NGT output was 1L to 1.5L of gastric contents on a daily basis for the past 72 hours.
Because the mass was obstructing the distal common bile duct, the patient underwent ERCP and stent placement.
This was not felt to be indicated and recommendations to assess the pancreatic stent were recommended given elevated t.bili and alk phos (6.5 and 272).
On [**10-23**],  He was started on vanco, zosyn and flagyl for possible small perforation.
On [**11-18**], the patient was noted by nephrology to have altered mental status concerning for uremia, and so he received a tunnelled hemodialysis cathether.
On [**11-19**] he was started on hemodialysis but became hypotensive to 40s and so dialysis was stopped early.
On [**11-20**] AMS, hypoxic, transferred to SICU, intubated, became tachy/brady then asystolic, pulse returned w/ CPR found to have massive MI by echo put on pressors and taken to cath lab.
Pt had stent placed in left main coronary and required IABP support, which was problem[**Name (NI) 115**] given recent AAA repair.
Pt required 4 pressors and transient CPR.
IABP was removed shortly due to distal skin mottling thought to be due to emboli from his aorta.
He continued to deteriorate with pH on ABG of <7, and Potassium at 6.7.
Pt's medications were all stopped, including pressors and morphine drip started for comfort.
