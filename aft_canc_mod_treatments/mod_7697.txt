Residual barium in neoesophagus without evidence of extravasation.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 7168**] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the Operating Room where he underwent a minimally invasive laparoscopic/thorascopic [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12351**] [**Doctor Last Name **] esophagogastrectomy.
He tolerated the procedure well and returned to the PACU in stable condition.
He had an epidural catheter placed for pain control which was effective.
He had cyclic tube feedings started via his J tube and were gradually increased to goal.
His right thoracotomy incision was healing well and he was able to effectively use his incentive spirometer effectively.
His epidural catheter was removed on [**2163-1-5**] and Roxicet was given via his J tube for pain control.
On [**2163-1-5**] he underwent a J tube study as he had significant tan drainage from around the tube with surrounding cellulitis.
After spiking a temperature to 101.6 he was pan cultured and placed on Unasyn and Fluconozole.
An abdominal CT showed subcutaneous air and possible extravasation of contrast through jejunostomy tube in the deep subcutaneous tissue of the left lateral aspect of the abdominal wall.
Following Mr. [**Known lastname 90958**] bedside incision and drainage of the J-tube site, his wound appeared moderately improved, with slight improvement noted in induration surrounding the site.
Given Mr. [**Known lastname 90958**] normal upper GI/swallow study, his chest tube and JP drain were removed on [**2163-1-6**] without issue.
He began full liquids on [**2163-1-6**] and tolerated them well and his pain was controlled with oral Roxicet.
