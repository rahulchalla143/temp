# Multifocal Pneumonia with Sepsis: ESBL Klebsiella and MRSA growing out of sputum.
Had 4 days of Cefepime / Vanco / Cipro, changed on [**2108-2-15**] to Meropenem / Vanco per sensitivities with a planned 14 day course.
Linezolid is somewhat contraindicated with anti-Parkinsons meds due to lack of breakdown of catecholamine metabolites, but benefit outweighs risk as he continued to grow staph in his sputum likely treatment failure on Vancomycin.
Linezolid was continued per request of his HCP although he was made [**Name (NI) 3225**].
As discussed while in the ICU and confirmed on the floor, patient was made a DNR/DNI-do not reintubate.
Given continued acute episodes of tachypnea/hypoxia and excess respiratory secretions, decision was made by HCP to allow current level of care (antibiotics, suctioning, oxygen, parkinson's meds) but to use pRN morphine for acute episodes of apparent discomfort described above.
He was made [**Name (NI) 3225**] on [**2108-3-4**], and managed with morphine and other symptomatic care.
He was treated with Vancomycin until it was discontinued on day 9 of treatment and Linezolid was started for a planned 14 day course as discussed above.
Continued buproprion and held mirtazapine.
# BPH: Initially held Terazosin and Doxazosin in the context of hypotension on presentation and continued infection.
These medications were restarted on the medical floor.
# Acute on Chronic RF: pre-renal physiology with increased BUN:Cr ratio and FeNA = 0.19%, likely [**1-25**] to dehydration in the setting of febrile illness in an incapacitated patient who is unable to increase his water intake in response to thirst.
Antibiotics OK, oxygen, home meds, and suctioning.
On [**2108-3-4**], his HCP decided to make him predominantly comfort measures, with the exception of continuing his Parkinson's disease medications and linezolid.
He was started on a morphine drip for comfort.
