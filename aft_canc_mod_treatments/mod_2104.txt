HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79 year old coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stenting in [**2120-7-13**], who presented to an outside hospital on [**2120-8-11**], acutely tachypneic and hypoxic.
On arrival in the Emergency Department, the patient was on 100% facial nonrebreather and oxygen saturation of 96% and respiratory rate of 20.
He was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for observation and treatment of his pulmonary emboli.
The patient had a three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2120-7-13**], followed by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting several days after coronary artery bypass graft.
Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
Imdur 60 mg a day.
Amiodarone 400 mg p.o.

Aspirin 325 mg a day.
Levoxyl 0.05 mg per day.
Plavix 75 mg p.o.
Glyburide 1.25 mg per day.
Percocet p.r.n.
LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, sodium was 137, potassium 5.4, chloride 100, bicarbonate 24, blood urea nitrogen 29, creatinine 1.4 which was up from the patient's baseline of 0.9 to 1.0, glucose 100, calcium 8.3, magnesium 2.3, phosphate 4.2.
CT from the outside hospital was reviewed here and showed multiple filling defects in branches of the left and right pulmonary arteries and small bilateral pleural effusions that had been present post coronary artery bypass graft.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is a 79 year old male who developed dyspnea and hypoxia in coronary artery bypass graft postoperative period with CT scan that was positive for multiple pulmonary emboli.
Pulmonary - The patient was started on Heparin for anticoagulation and monitored in the Intensive Care Unit on 100% nonrebreather.
Over the next several days, the patient was weaned from nonrebreather face mask down to two liters of oxygen nasal cannula where he was saturating at 93 to 94%.
Thus, he was started on Combivent and Flovent meter dose inhalers with some improvement in symptomatology.
Cardiovascular - The patient was in normal sinus rhythm on Amiodarone on presentation and remained in normal sinus rhythm on telemetry, hemodynamically stable throughout the course of his stay.
Amiodarone was stopped since it was felt that it was probably started due to his postoperative atrial fibrillation without events and the patient remained in normal sinus rhythm after Amiodarone was discontinued.
Throughout the course of his stay, the patient was gently hydrated due to his depressed left ventricular function, occasionally developing volume overload including rales at his bases bilaterally for which he was gently diuresed with Lasix p.r.n.
His creatinine returned to baseline with gentle fluid boluses over the days following admission.
The patient had good response to fluid bolusing.
Urinalysis was sent which showed many bacteria, [**4-16**] white blood cells and for this, the patient was started on Ciprofloxacin to treat urinary tract infection.
The patient required multiple fluid boluses for low urine output followed by subsequent gentle diuresis with Lasix p.r.n.
Hematology - The patient was anticoagulated on Heparin drip until [**2120-8-15**], at which time he was started on Lovenox and Coumadin was started.
The patient was maintained on Lovenox for 48 hours after his INR became therapeutic.
Given the [**Hospital 228**] medical issues, surgery was declined during this hospital stay and it was felt that the patient should follow-up as an outpatient.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm - The patient was evaluated by vascular surgery while in house who declined intervention at this point as well given the [**Hospital 228**] medical issues.
The patient will follow-up with vascular clinic as an outpatient for possible surgical intervention or stent placement in his abdomen.
to avoid becoming dehydrated, however, when given intravenous fluids, the patient tended to become volume overloaded and have difficulty voiding as well.
The patient was continued on his Synthroid.
Physical therapy - The patient was seen by physical therapy while in house and found the patient to be very weak and debilitated and in need of further physical therapy as an outpatient or in a rehabilitation setting.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1159**] was going to coordinate patient follow-up regarding his squamous cell cancer in the area closest to the patient's home and it is likely the patient will need radiation oncology intervention to palliate his lip lesion until he becomes stable from the surgical perspective.
