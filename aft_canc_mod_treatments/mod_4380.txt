Taking oxycontin 80 TID at home plus prn oxycodone 30 mg without relief.
Also using Zofran, ativan and Compazine which help with nausea significantly.

[**2127-9-5**] Sputum  GRAM STAIN (Final [**2127-9-5**]):       [**12-2**] PMNs and >10 epithelial cells/100X field.
CXR [**9-2**]: FINDINGS: Compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right-sided chest tube.
Overall increase in the right lower lung consolidation and cavitation within a more discrete consolidation concerning for breakdown in pneumonic consolidation or infected cavitary metastasis.
Overall increase in the right lower lung consolidation and cavitation within a more discrete consolidation concerning for breakdown in pneumonic consolidation or infected cavitary metastasis.
CXR [**9-5**]: Interval removal of a right pleural catheter with placement of a chest tube with its tip at the apex of the lung.
The endotracheal tube remains in satisfactory position with the tip at the thoracic inlet.
Small amount of subcutaneous emphysema within overlying the right lateral soft tissues likely related to chest tube placement.
A right chest tube remains in place.
CXR [**9-7**]: Right apical chest tube remains in place.
He was started on Prednisone 40 mg, with plans for a 2 week taper.
He was also started on Azithromycin for presumed bronchitis, and he will complete a 5 day course.
His Oxycontin was uptitrated from 80 TID to 100 mg po TID, due to persistent pain rated approx [**8-17**].
Palliative Care was consulted for assistance with symptom management; they continued to follow him and adjust his pain medication regimen in the ICU (see below) .
# Metastatic renal cell CA: On bevacizumab and temsirolimus (Torisel).
After transfer to the ICU for decompensating respiratory issues, chemotherapy was stopped (see below).
# Hx bilateral DVT: Continued warfarin on the floor.
According to anticoag sheet in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] oncologist, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]: "no heparin bridging required for subtherapeutic INR's or procedures."
After patient was transferred to the ICU, warfarin was stopped in favor of heparin gtt given ongoing need for thoracic/interventional pulmonary procedures (see below).
# CAD: Continued outpatient aspirin and metoprolol.
#PTX Patient developed R PTX prior to transfer to the ICU, requiring chest tube placement by interventional pulmonology.
R pneumothorax was monitored & noted to wax and wane, especially worsening when the chest tube was changed from suction to water seal.
The continuous air leak/ongoing stable PTX with a chest tube in place was strongly suggestive of a bronchopleural fistula, as discussed below.
A small, stable PTX persisted after placement of the larger-sized chest tube by thoracic surgery, also discussed below.
# R PNA/empyema/bronchopleural fistula Given his worsening tachypnea and increasing oxygen requirement s/p chest tube placement for PTX, there was concern for an additional pulmonary process.
Continued air leak despite re-expansion of PTX pointed toward development of a bronchopleural fistula, with contribution of splinting and low minute ventilation secondary to pleuritic pain.
WBCs continue to worsen with a bandemia.
Vancomycin, Cefepime and Levofloxacin were started for broad-coverage for hospital-acquired PNA.
Patient was electively intubated for BAL for micro specimen collection.
BAL fluid and pleural fluid were collected during the procedure and sent for culture and studies - they eventually grew coag+ staph.
While the patient was intubated, thoracic surgery placed a larger chest tube (at the bedside).
The patient was successfully extubated within hours after BAL and chest tube placement.
O2 sats were maintained >93% on supplemental oxygen with mucous suctioning and nebs as needed.
However, over the next two days the patient developed an increasing O2 requirement to maximum high-flow oxygen, and serial CXRs showed worsening loculated empyema, with thick purulent drainage from the chest tube.
Palliative care was consulted and followed the patient for symptom management, given the lack of further onc treatment options and need for pain management during acute pulmonary developments.
The patient remained full code until [**9-7**] when, given concern rapidly worsening pulmonary function despite maximum-flow oxygen, chest tube in place, and broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin/levaquin/cefepime), a family meeting was initiated to communicate concern over poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options.
Antibiotics and chest tube drainage continued as before.
He was pain free on a PO regimen of 120 oxycontin TID, 300 mg gabapentin qHS, and dilaudid IV 2-3 mg q2H PRN.
When his code status was changed to DNR/DNI it was determined that he may need to transition to IV pain medication.
Nutrion was consulted; TPN was started because, although patient has no gastrointestinal contraindication to tube feeds, he requires continues oxygen supplementation by high-flow facemask.
Home dose warfarin 5 mg daily on Mo/We/Fr/Sa, 7.5 mg daily on Tu/Th/[**Doctor First Name **], recently restarted this hospitalization; this was held and, in addition, he received 2U FFP to reverse INR 3.9 prior to placement of chest tube and PICC line.
Once procedures were completed, he was restarted on a heparin drip and maintained on the heparin drip thereafter.
# Metastatic renal cell CA: On bevacizumab and temsirolimus (Torisel) prior to admission.
Initially deferred further treatment decisions to the primary oncology team, who discussed with the patient that there are no other chemotherapy options.
No chemotherapy was administered during the patient's ICU course.
# Acute on chronic kidney disease: Known renal cell CA with prior baseline 1.3-1.7.
He was given fluid boluses for low urine output.
He was continued on an agressive bowel regimen, especially while on narcotics.
Continued outpatient ASA, metoprolol (statin recently discontinued).

You were found to have a severe necrotizing pneumonia with a connection between the space around your lung and one of your airways.
A chest tube was placed to treat the pneumothorax.
We treated you with antibiotics and helped to control your chest pain so you could cough more to clear the infection.
The thoracic surgery team thought that there was not much more we could do to treat your lung problems, as your lungs are too weak to tolerate a surgery and intubation.
Given your poor lung condition and metastatic cancer, you, your family, and our medical team all agreed that it would be in your best interest to transition to hospice care with making comfort a top priority.
You will go to hospice with pain medication, and will no longer be on antibiotics or have a chest tube in place.
Please note the following changes have been made to your medications: - Please START lorazepam 1mg Q8H prn for nausea or anxiety - Please START benzonatate 100mg TID prn for cough - Please START benzonatate 100mg QHS prn for pain - Please START hydromorphone in 0.9 % NS  30 mg/30 mL (1 mg/mL) Pt Controlled Analgesic and CADD pump for pain control - Please START Oxyfast 1-20 mg Q1H as needed for pain or respiratory distress   Followup Instructions: Department: BMT/ONCOLOGY UNIT When: MONDAY [**2127-9-15**] at 12:30 PM [**Telephone/Fax (1) 447**] Building: Fd [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] Building ([**Hospital Ward Name 1826**]/[**Hospital Ward Name 1827**] Complex) [**Location (un) 3971**] Campus: EAST     Best Parking: Main Garage  ***Please call the office to inform them if you will no longer be able to make this appointment.
