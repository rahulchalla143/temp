Patient was noted to be hypoxic on routine vitals with O2 saturation of 70% on 5 litres nasal cannula.
Patient received aggressive suctioning that yielded 20cc of what appeared to be gastric contents.
On [**2138-8-3**], patient had been started on Vancomycin and Piperacillin-Tazobactam for presumed hospital acquired pneumonia based on increased O2 requirement, infiltrates on chest x-ray, and low-grade fevers.
An NG tube was placed for persistent obstruction.
However, on the day of transfer, patient's NG tube was found to have not been functioning, and was pulled.
Patient is on furosemide at home for unclear reasons, but this had been held 4 days prior to transfer due to fluid-responsive hypotension in setting of gastric outlet obstruction.
He had not received any fluid boluses since [**2138-8-3**].
-- Status post cardiac arrest, past surgery [**55**] years prior.
Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
Considered G-/G-J tube placement, but was not clinically stable enough to tolerate procedure.
Palliative external beam radiation was considered.
He ultimately required NG placement and constant suction because of nausea and vomiting.
After discussions with the family, given his rapid decompensation, goals were changed to symptom management and transition to hospice.
Hypotension/hypoxia: He developed a GI bleed related to the stent leading to hypotension which responded to IV fluid and blood transfusion.
He responded to tracheal suctioning.
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for health care associated pneumonia  3.
Hypernatremia/Nutrition: unable to tolerate food due to gastric outlet obstruction.
Hypernatremia related to dehydration, improved with IV D5W.
Disposition: after a lengthy hospitalization and rapid progression of his disease, goals of care were changed to symptom management.
