Admission Date:  [**2143-11-1**]       Discharge Date:  [**2143-11-14**]   Service:  Medical Intensive Care Unit  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Apnea, status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube replacement  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms [**Known lastname **] is an 85 year old nursing home patient with a past medical history significant for stroke, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who came in on [**11-2**], for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube replacement.
The patient was intubated for the procedure and after the procedure the patient was extubated and was maintaining good oxygen saturation of about 92 to 94% on 2 liters of oxygen through the nasal cannula.
The patient also has a history of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization in the past and so the surgery team who did the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube replacement contact[**Name (NI) **] the [**Name (NI) **] Intensive Care Unit and asked the patient to be transferred to the [**Name (NI) **] Intensive Care Unit for further workup and evaluation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Left atrial myxoma, stroke, hypertension, recurrent pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diverticulosis, breast cancer, status post left mastectomy, questionable gastric cancer, hiatal hernia, left proximal humeral fracture, status post wide cataract surgery.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Trazodone 50 mg p.o.
q.d., Paxil 20 mg p.o.
q.d., Aspirin 81 mg p.o.
q.d., Neurontin 600 mg p.o.
t.i.d., Calcium carbonate 650 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Albuterol, Atrovent nebulizers, Timoptic 0.5%, Xalatan 0.005%, multivitamin one tablet p.o.
ALLERGIES:  Digoxin and Erythromycin  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission, in general the patient was intubated, was awake and responded to some verbal commands.
Positive percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube on the left side.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Pulmonary, the patient was initially intubated for the procedure.
After the procedure the patient was extubated but became apneic and her oxygen saturation dropped and her chest x-ray showed a right upper lobe collapse, and so the patient was reintubated and a bronchoscopy was done with a significant amount of mucous clubbing, secretions were removed.
The patient was receiving a significant amount of fluid boluses because of the patient was hypotension, and as we were trying to wean off of the pressor, she was getting more and more fluid.
Initially the patient was on assist control but then she would be switched over to pressor support of 15 or pressor support of 10, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5, FIO2 of 35% and the patient would tolerate that well.
However, whenever an attempt was made to wean her off of mechanical ventilation by lowering the pressor support to 5, the patient would become tachypneic, tachycardiac and the title volumes would decrease and the patient would not tolerate that very well.
Despite multiple attempts to wean off of her mechanical ventilation an extensive discussion was held with the family in which it was decided that if we would try to extubate her one more time and she would fail extubation, what would be the next thing to do.
Her oxygen saturations were 96 to 98% on 2 liters through the nasal cannula  Cardiovascular - Rate and rhythm, the patient was mostly normal sinus rhythm and would get occasional premature atrial contractions and premature ventricular contractions.
Pump, the patient was initially on a pressor, Neo 1 mcg/kg/min, however, that was weaned off within a day or two after the patient transferred to the [**Year (4 digits) **] Intensive Care Unit.
The patient also received multiple fluid boluses to help her maintain her blood pressure.
At that time we decided to start her on broad coverage of Levofloxacin and Flagyl for questionable aspiration pneumonia since she did have the bronchial plugging that lead to the right upper lung collapse.
In addition, the patient was also started on Vancomycin initially at 1 gm q.
In addition on [**11-7**], the patient was also started on Cefepime 2 mg intravenously q.
12 for pseudomonas coverage since her sputum grew out mild to moderate pseudomonas aeruginosa which was sensitive to Cefepime and mild to moderate Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Gastrointestinal - The patient is questionable status post gastric cancer, needs further verification.
The patient has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed.
Dressings were changed as per protocol and the patient has been receiving tube feeds through that without any difficulty.
Heme - Hematocrit had fallen from 40 to 29.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - As mentioned earlier the patient received multiple boluses since she was initially hypotensive.
The patient was also given Lasix 20 mg p.o.
to help with the diuresis since we thought she was volume overloaded.
In addition, the patient is also getting tube feeds through the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube and she was having her electrolytes checked, usually b.i.d.
Prophylaxis - The patient was on subcutaneous heparin and proton pump inhibitors.
Cefpodoxime 400 mg b.i.d.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Ferrous Sulfate 325 mg p.o.
Flovent 110 mcg 6 puffs i.h.
Timolol 0.5% one drop left eye b.i.d.
Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously b.i.d.
Prevacid 30 mg p.o.
Aspirin 81 mg p.o.
Trazodone 50 mg p.o.
Miconazole powder 2% apply q.i.d.
Neurontin 600 mg p.o.
Calcium carbonate 650 mg p.o.
Multivitamin one tablet p.o.
