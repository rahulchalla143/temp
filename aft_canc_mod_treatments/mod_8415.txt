[**2170-4-11**] RUE Ultrasound: No evidence of DVT  Brief Hospital Course: This is an 85 year old female with hx HTN, lymphoma s/p R-CHOP, SAH in setting of mechanical fall, admitted following unwittnessed non-mechanical fall and found to have recurrent lymphoma.
She received IVF, tylenol and demerol as needed.
Her presentation was discussed with her hematologist/oncologist who concluded that her rigors, fevers and fatigue was also strongly suggestive of  B sypmtoms due to lymphoma recurrence.
However, she developed altered mental status and severe hyponatremia and chemotherapy was ultimately deferred due to her poor functional status.
She was empirically started on argatroban.
Patient was started on metoprolol tartrate and uptitrated as patient could tolerate.
She was continued on ASA 81 mg but was not further anticoagulated due to thrombocytopenia.
Her dose of amiodarone should be tapered to 200mg po daily after discharge (should switch to this dose on [**4-23**])  #.
She was started on fluid restriction and given lasix because she was felt to be volume overloaded; however, her sodium continued to trend down and she became more somnolent and confused.
She was transferred to the ICU for hypertonic saline administration.
Ultimately, her hypertonic saline was stopped and she was started on lasix, NaCL tabs, tubefeeds, and 1L fluid restriction per renal recommendations.
She was given some saline boluses with improvement in her sodium.
She was then weaned off salt tabs and her sodium remained stable on only a 1L fluid restriction.
Her delirium improved with hypertonic saline administration in the ICU but she remained mild delirious, felt to be due to resolving ICU delirium, UTI effect, bronchitis effect, or hyponatremia effect.
For this, she was given NS boluses with improvment in BP.
She remained normotensive after discontinuation of all BP medications.
She did get intermittent blood transfusions during her stay.
