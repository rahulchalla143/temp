Pulmonary prospective:   On [**10-5**], the patient went for a suction thrombectomy by Interventional Radiology.
An IVC filter was placed at that time as well and a left pulmonary artery stent was also placed.
Minimal clot was aspirated back leading to the placement of the stent and a question of whether the embolus was tumor in origin.
On [**10-16**], the patient underwent a trial of nitric oxide without any change in her cardiac output or urine output or her pulmonary vascular resistance.
On [**10-19**], the patient awoke having been off sedation for the last eight days.
On [**10-22**], the patient had a worsening of her left lower lobe infiltrate and required increasing amounts of oxygen but stabilized on 60% FIO2 with PEEP of 10.
On [**10-28**], the patient received a bedside tracheostomy.
All showed approximately the same thing, an ejection fraction of greater than 60% with a hyperdynamic LV and RV that showed abnormal septal motion consistent with volume or pressure overload and [**Last Name (un) **] sign on admission, all pointing to an acute pulmonary process.
On electrocardiogram on admission, the patient had an S in lead I, a Q3 in the T3 which cleared after the suction thrombectomy and stent placement.
On [**10-9**], when the patient was intubated, the patient became hypotensive and required Levophed at low doses to maintain her blood pressure.
On the [**10-11**], the patient became acutely hypotensive and required three pressors, Levophed, Neo-Synephrine and vasopressin.
The patient was weaned off of the Neo-Synephrine on [**10-12**].
On [**10-14**], the patient was given stress dose steroids for persistent hypotension.
On [**10-15**], a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to measure pressures in the pulmonary vasculature.
The objective was to maximize cardiac output and urine output.
Overnight on the 18th to 19th, all other remaining pressors were weaned off.
On [**10-15**] through the 22, the cardiac output slowly increased each day and the Swan was discontinued on the 22nd.
A Swan was placed at that time that showed non cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
Levophed therapy was initiated for hypotension.
From a hematologic point of view, the patient was started on heparin upon admission for her pulmonary embolus.
Work-up was initiated prior to this and hit antibodies came back positive for IgM.
At that time, [**10-15**], all heparin was discontinued and a Hematologic consult was obtained.
[**10-16**], Refludan was started.
Of note, the hematologic work-up for hypercoagulability was limited because the patient was on heparin and antithrombin therapy for most of her stay up to this point.
However, anticardiolipin antibody was IgM positive.
At that time, ceftriaxone and Zithromax were started and cultures were sent.
On [**10-11**], the patient had a positive urine culture for Citrobacter pansensitive and therapy was not adjusted.
The antibiotics were broadened from Ceftriaxone and Zithromax to vancomycin and ceftazidime at that time and the patient stabilized.
The treatment course persisted for ten days with vancomycin and ceftazidime and these were discontinued on [**10-20**].
On [**10-19**], Diflucan was started for a presumed urinary tract infection.
On [**10-22**], the patient was febrile again overnight, again was pancultured and vancomycin therapy was initiated on [**10-23**].
These antibiotics were discontinued on the 28th.
Since the 28th, the patient has remained afebrile on monotherapy of vancomycin for the presumed Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.
Renal:  The patient had decreased urine output starting on [**10-11**], the day she became hypotensive and required three pressors to maintain her blood pressure.
On [**10-17**], after being weaned off the pressors and maintaining a stable blood pressure on her own, her urine output increased and was quite good over subsequent days.
On [**10-21**], Lasix therapy was initiated with good effect for agitation, agitation being defined as increased respiratory rate and tachycardia likely secondary to dyspnea.
The patient has maintained good urine output since and continues to receive Lasix as needed.
Gastrointestinal:  After admission and intubation, the patient had decreased bowel sounds and would not tolerate her tube feeds.
After discontinuation of the morphine, the patient had a return of bowel sounds and began tolerating her tube feeds and has tolerated her tube feeds since without any problems.
Long-term, the patient will require diuresis as she restores her body's supply of albumin.
On [**10-14**], steroids were given for persistent hypotension and were discontinued two days later.
The patient is diabetic and has been on a regular insulin sliding scale throughout her admission with fingersticks q.i.d.
Intermittently, the patient has required an insulin drip for persistent hyperglycemia.
Also, the patient is hypothyroid and has been on her standing outpatient Synthroid dose since admission.
At the time this was considered a direct contraindication to thrombolytic therapy which is why Interventional Radiology performed the suction thrombectomy.
Also, from a neurologic prospective, the patient woke up on [**10-20**], after a number days on sedation and was awake and following commands.
