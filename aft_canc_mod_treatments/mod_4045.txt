As mentioned earlier, he is currently on chemotherapy with [**Doctor Last Name **]-Taxol as well as radiation treatment.
He has been on a variety of antipsychotic and mood-stabilizing agents in the past and has had at least two sessions of electroconvulsive therapy.
He did extremely well on Clozaril between [**2099**] and [**2102-5-7**] until it had to be stopped because of seizures.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 20179**] was admitted to the Psychiatric Unit on a Section 12.
Over the first two days of his admission he did not take any of his medications, but when asked "How can I get out of this place?," he was told if he complies with treatment and takes his medications, he will soon be well enough to leave the hospital.
At that point he did start taking his medications which included Depakote and Seroquel and seemed to be doing fairly well in the unit.
During his admission, he went over for radiation therapy every day and did well with it for the first several days and was able to stay in good behavioral control.
On [**2103-5-31**], he was sent back from radiation therapy without getting treatment, because he seemed more confused than usual and had a low blood pressure.
He began receiving intravenous Dopamine while in the Psychiatric Unit.
I would suggest that while on the Medical Unit he have a one-to-one sitter at all times and his agitation be treated with intravenous Haldol 2 to 5 mg q.
