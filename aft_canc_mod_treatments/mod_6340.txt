The patient was given 2gm of IV Ceftazidime for his pneumonia and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care per the request of his family.
1L IVF given and the patient's HR improved to 100.
He underwent a work up which included a CT of the abdomen and pelvis which showed colitis involving the distal portion of the transverse colon, descending colon, and proximal sigmoid colon.
During that admission, the patient was ultimately found to be [**Date Range **] positive, treated with PO vancomycin, and discharged back to his [**Hospital1 1501**] on [**2127-2-17**] with improvement in his symptoms.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by the development of tamponade physiology, and the patient ultimately underwent a pericardial window.

The patient should have magnesium and potassium repletion on a daily basis.
His magnesium and potassium levels should be checked every day and given repletion on the follow scale: Mg < 2.0, give 2gm IV Magnesium Mg < 1.4, give 4gm IV Magnesium K < 4.0, give 40meq Potassium (PO or IV) K < 3.6, give 60meq Potassium (PO or IV) K < 3.2, give 80meq Potassium (PO or IV) 4.
