Workup, during the past year, has resulted in numerous attempts for unsuccessful endometrial biopsies.
She has been receiving Lupron treatment for this vaginal bleeding.
On transfer to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department she was transferred with one unit of packed red blood cells.
The hospital course was complicated by sepsis, as well as intubation requiring eventual tracheostomy placement.
Status post ureterostomy with sigmoid loop.
Cesarean section times two.
Ureterostomy and sigmoid loop.
Prior to onset of vaginal bleeding, cycles every 28 days; lasting for five days.
Cesarean section times two for breech presentation at 36 weeks.
Dilantin 200 mg PO b.i.d.
Vitamin C. 4.
Captopril 50 mg PO q.d.
Methergine 0.2 mg q.4h.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to PENICILLIN (hives).
Irregular and enhancing fluid collection in mid and left pelvis, which possibly represents the bladder and may be related to vesicovaginal fistula, but an abscess cannot be excluded.
By report at an outside hospital, similar collection was described on [**2152-3-1**]; status post urostomy with sigmoid conduit, status post midline exploratory laparotomy with postoperative wound infection now healing with secondary intent, status post recent uterine artery embolization with embolic material in the right pelvis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for intractable vaginal bleeding.
At the outside hospital, she had already received two units of packed red blood cells.
Given the patient's complicated medical and past surgical history it was felt that the patient would most benefit from an interventional radiology procedure in an attempt to stop the bleeding rather than proceeding with surgical intervention.
On [**2152-8-19**], the patient underwent uterine artery embolization with good success.
She also received another two units of packed red blood cells, which brought her post transfusion hematocrit to 34.7.
She had a femoral arterial line placed for easier vascular access.
The patient did require an addition two units of packed red blood cells after the hematocrit was noted to drop to 27.3.
On the day of discharge, the hematocrit was noted to be 30.5.
Vaginal bleeding status post uterine artery embolization.
Distorted pelvic anatomy as shown on CT and ultrasound.
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO b.i.d.
Flagyl 500 mg PO t.i.d.
