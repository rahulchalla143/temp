Admission Date:  [**2162-3-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2162-3-31**]   Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Univasc  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain, GI bleed  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement [**3-15**] RUQ biloma drainage [**3-21**] PICC line placement [**3-23**]   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 18915**] is a 89 yo [**Location 7972**] female with HTN, HL, h/o treated H. pylori infection, iron deficiency anemia, on coumadin for pulmonary emboli diagnosed on [**2162-1-18**], poor historian who presented to her PCP's office today for a scheduled visit.
She recalls taking some pain medications for neck pain a few days ago but does not know which one.
She denies any recent changes in her stools, although they are dark at times and often hard; she is on iron supplements.
Of note, on her last admission, there was concern for occult GI malignancy given her iron deficiency anemia and monocytosis, but her last colonoscopy on [**2161-12-28**] showed only internal hemorrhoids.
GI was consulted and initially recommended NG lavage, but this deferred given her elevated INR.
Patient was given pantoprazole 40 mg IV.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Iron deficiency anemia Monocytosis S/p H. pylori treatment in [**10-25**]   Social History: She is a nonsmoker, does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs.
Although this may represent papillary stenosis, if there is concern based on laboratory data for obstruction of the lower CBD, ERCP could be considered.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 89 year old female with hx of PE, iron deficiency anemia, and monocytosis on peripheral smear admitted for abdominal pain and guaiac positive stools and newly diagnosed with a 10cm gastric adenocarcinoma with hospital course complicated by acute cholecystitis requiring percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement, now with RUQ abscesses vs. biloma from a likely gallbladder perforation and C Diff colitis.
IR drained one of these fluid collections on [**3-21**], but could not reach the second.
The fluid removed was not frankly purulent and it is likely that the patient's gallbladder has perforated and is leaking bile into her peritoneum and RUQ causing peritoneal irritation and pain.
The patient was started on [**Doctor Last Name **] co PO 125 mg q6 starting [**3-22**] and Flagyl was added on [**2162-3-27**].
Surgery feels like she could be a surgical candidate for a partial gastrectomy.
Hem/onc says that gastric adenocarcinoma is surgically staged and gastrectomy followed by chemotherapy would be potentially curative if the tumor is localized.
A family meeting on [**3-19**] was held and the decision was to proceed with surgical management with no post-op chemotherapy.
She was maintained on a PPI twice daily.
IR placed a percutaneous cholecystostomy drain and she was started on Unasyn.
Bile was growing group B strep, Corynebacterium diphtheroids species, and clostridium perfringens.
PE: The patient had a PE in [**Month (only) 404**] and had been anticoagulated on Coumadin at home.
Her Coumadin was initially held in the setting of a GI bleed and she was placed on a heparin gtt.
In light of Mrs.[**Last Name (un) 37185**] multiple medical problems, poor prognosis given all of these co morbidities and her age the palliative Care service was contact[**Name (NI) **] to assist the patient and her family in dealing with these difficult end of life issues.
Comfort measures is the number one priority.
Her anticoagulation and TPN was discontinued and her pain was controlled with Morphine and a Fentanyl patch.
She has had some nausea which is relieved with Zofran but potentially it could be from the Fentanyl and or Morphine so that will need to be watched and assessed.
