Recommend repeat radiograph following diuresis.
EUS was performed using a mini echoendoscope and therefore images were limited.
The pt responded well to fluid boluses and her chronic prednisone was increased from 7.5mg to 15mg then down titrated again to 7.5 mg daily.
Her blood pressure remained stable on the floor in SBP 90-110 range, although with diuresis (see below), came down to SBP 100.
IR placed a G tube that was complicated by hypercapnea/hypoxia thought likely related to medication effect.
However, once this resolved, tube feeds were started and advanced to goal without difficulty.
Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Not on home 02, initially on 6L NC after EGD, later weaned down to 3-4L.
She was given boluses of 10mg IV furosemide prn with goal negative 500-1000ml daily.
Pt noted improvement in her dyspnea with diuresis, and was weaned off supplemental O2, although diuresis was limited by borderline hypotension and orthostasis.
She was also seen by IP, who felt that thoracentesis was not indicated.
She was continue [**Male First Name (un) **] lasix 10 mg PO daily.
Hypercapnea: Suspected that this was acute decompensation in setting of G tube placement, as patient is very sensitive to sedating medications.
Also, she was later started on fluticasone/salmeterol and tiotropium for presumptive COPD given tobacco history.
She remained off her anti-platelet agents in anticipation of her upcoming procedure, although they were later restareted.
