The patient was maintained with transfusion as needed and aranesp qweek.
PMH: - diverticulosis complicated by bleeding - bleeding anal fissures - bleeding AVMs ([**2-/2195**]) - GERD - emphysema(mild) - dental extraction - myelodysplastic syndrome dx [**8-/2194**] with persistent blastemia - hysterectomy at age 39 - hemorrhoidectomy x 4 - colon polyps, AVM - bilateral bunion surgery - hypertension - hyperlipidemia - proctalgia fugax - TMJD  Social History: The patient is married and lives with her husband.
No foley catheter/tracheostomy/PEG/ventilator support/chest tube/colostomy Psychiatric:  pleasant and interactive  ACCESS: [x]PIV .
Given the risk of uncontrollable bleeding in the setting of low platelets, the clot was not removed.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 73078**] is 79 year old pleasant woman with a Past medical history significant for MDS with AML transformation on Dacogen, diverticulosis, known cecal AVMs admitted from clinic on [**2195-4-1**] in the setting of a transfusion reaction to platelets with thrombocytopenia who was noted to develop bright red blood per rectum with acute hematocrit drop who underwent repeat colonoscopy showing non-bleeding diverticulosis of the entire colon and bleeding angioectasias of the cecum treated with Argon Plasma coagulation.
She required a second colonoscopy for repeated bloody bowel movements which showed a clot adherent to the cecum.
She will require HLA matched platelet transfusions in the future if needed.
# cecal AVMs:  She was transferred to the ICU twice for bright red blood per rectum.
The patient developed BRBPR, and was found to have cecal AVMs on colonoscopy s/p APC.
Hemostasis achieved with Argon Plasma coagulation therapy on [**2195-4-3**].
During her stay she required several units of PRBC and platelets.
While on the floor, she had a few bloody bowel movements however the night of [**4-17**] she had total of 450 cc bloody watery stools which required amicar drip for 8 hours (her platelets were in the 40-50's).
# thrombocytopenia: Secondary to chemotherapy and MDS/AML concerns.
Concern for consumptive process following transfusion of platelets in the setting of possible ITP vs. TTP however Hematologic smear was without schistocytes and there was no evidence of renal failure or neurologic concerns; no fevers.
The patient also had two transfusion reactions to platelets when first admitted.
While the patient was actively bleeding, she was also given Amicar (2 grams IV with 1gram/hour IV infusion overnight on [**2195-4-2**]).
She was found to have a positive PRA and required HLA matched platelets for all subsequent transfusions.
Her twin sister was tested at Red Cross for potential candidate to donate platelets for her sister however since she takes aspirin and plavix, this was not a suitable option.
Of note, her platelet count was improving already and did not require further platelet transfusions.
She was premedicated with famotidine, benadryl, and hydrocortisone.
A blood bank work up was initiated, and the patient was given group specific platelets.
Sister was a potential donor however it wasn't suitable given her anti-platelet therapy as above.
She did not require further platelet transfusions once her platelet count started to increase.
# constipation:  The patient has a history of severe constipation, however, her home medications were held in the setting of her BRBPR and then restarted upon discharge given resolution of bloody bowel movements.
Transitional Issues: - The patient had transfusion reaction to platelets; a blood bank work up was initiated and she was found to be PRA positive; she will require HLA matched platelets for all subsequent transfusions.
