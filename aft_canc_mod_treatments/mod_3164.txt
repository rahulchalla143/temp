Oxygen saturations are 92 to 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
She is transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for attempt at rigid bronchoscopy to open the left main stem bronchus.
History of thyroid surgery  MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Digoxin 0.25 mg once daily, Flecainide 100 mg twice a day, albuterol metered dose inhaler every two hours as needed, DuoNeb aerosols every four hours, fluticasone 220 mcg two puffs twice a day, brimonidine ophthalmic solution, Diltiazem 60 mg every eight hours, Synthroid 0.075 mcg once daily, montelukast 10 mg once daily, Protonix 40 mg once daily, Ativan intravenously as needed.
Pulmonary:  The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on day number one of admission for further management of her left main stem bronchial obstruction.
A rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debridement and stent placement was performed without complications.
A CT of the chest done prior to this procedure had confirmed the left main stem occlusion extending into the right upper lobe bronchus, and additionally showed a small left pleural effusion, extensive right ground-glass opacities, septal thickening consistent with lymphangitic spread.
The patient was placed on levofloxacin and clindamycin given the possibility of post-obstructive pneumonia.
At baseline, she required 5 to 6 liters nasal cannula to maintain an oxygen saturation of 89 to 90%.
She received periodic Atrovent and albuterol nebulizer treatments, which increased her oxygen saturation when she would desaturate to the mid-80s.
She also required non-rebreather mask treatment on several occasions to maintain her oxygen saturation.
A Cardiology consult saw the patient when she was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, and recommended initiation of amiodarone and discontinuation of flecainide.
Her rate was brought down with both oral and intravenous metoprolol.
This procedure was performed on [**12-19**] without incident.
She is transferred to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with plans to continue amiodarone 400 mg three times a day for seven additional days, followed by 400 mg once daily for three weeks, followed by 200 mg once daily.
The patient was anticoagulated with heparin throughout this admission for atrial fibrillation/flutter.
She was placed on Warfarin after the ablation procedure.
She is to be overlapped with heparin until her INR becomes therapeutic.
Infectious Disease:  As above, the patient was initiated on a 14 day course of levofloxacin and clindamycin for post-obstructive pneumonia.
Her nausea was improved with scheduled Compazine and as needed Zofran.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Large-cell lung cancer, status post left bronchial stent, atrial fibrillation/flutter, status post ablation, pneumonia, hypothyroidism  DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair to poor  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol 25 mg by mouth three times a day, Coumadin 5 mg by mouth once daily, heparin per protocol, amiodarone 400 mg by mouth three times a day, ipratropium two puffs inhaled four times a day, albuterol two puffs inhaled every six hours as needed, fluticasone 440 mcg inhaled twice a day, salmeterol two puffs inhaled twice a day, clindamycin 300 mg by mouth every six hours for five days, levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth every 24 hours for five days, levothyroxine 75 mcg by mouth once daily, brimonidine ophthalmic solution, Protonix 40 mg by mouth once daily, Compazine 10 mg by mouth every six hours, Zofran 4 mg intravenously every six hours as needed  DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for further treatment of her lung cancer.
She was taken to the operating room for repeat rigid bronch that revealed repeat occlusion with tumor.
This was treated with laser treatment but pt continued to have respiratory difficulty.
She elected to make herself comfort measures only.
She was started on a morphine drip to treat her respiratory distress and eventually passed away in her room at the [**Hospital1 18**].
