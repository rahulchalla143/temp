Admission Date:  [**2144-9-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2144-9-16**]  Date of Birth:   [**2089-9-20**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old male with known coronary artery disease who was admitted to [**Hospital6 2910**] on [**2144-9-9**], for elective cardiac catheterization.
Past medical history is significant for coronary artery disease status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with stent of the left anterior descending coronary artery in [**2138**].
He received morphine prior to catheterization.
Catheterization demonstrated a tight LAD lesion, 70% proximal, 90% mid LAD, resulting in an inability to see his previous LAD stent.
The patient continued to have chest pain status post catheterization with no electrocardiogram changes evident.
He was started on a nitroglycerin intravenous drip at 80 mcg/minute, Aggrastat and heparin.
Upon arrival vital signs were 97.8, blood pressure 140 to 160 over 90 to 100, heart rate in the 60's with normal sinus rhythm, oxygen saturation 98 to 100% on two liters nasal cannula oxygen.
Prior to catheterization at [**Hospital1 69**], patient received fentanyl 25 mcg for his discomfort and Versed.
A Cypher stent was deployed in the proximal/middle LAD.
The patient complained of recurrent pain so additional doses of morphine were given.
Subsequently, nitroglycerin and Aggrastat were discontinued.
Intravenous fluids were started with aggressive fluid hydration.
Upon arrival he then received another 10 mg of morphine, 1 mg of Versed, 50 mcg of fentanyl and Phenergan 25 mg IV.
Coronary artery disease status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent to left anterior descending artery in [**2138**].
Chronic back pain status post multiple surgeries (times eight).
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
Prostate cancer status post radical prostatectomy.

PERTINENT LABORATORIES, X-RAYS AND OTHER STUDIES: Laboratories drawn on the morning of [**2144-9-9**] at [**Hospital6 11896**] showed sodium 132, potassium 3.1, chloride 96, bicarbonate 26, BUN 14, creatinine 0.9, glucose 114, calcium 7.7, magnesium 2.0, creatinine kinase 126, troponin 0.06.
Successful stenting of the main left anterior descending was performed with a 3.5 x 18 mm Cypher (drug alluding stent).
Coronary artery disease:  Patient with known history of coronary artery disease status post coronary catheterization times two on [**2144-9-9**], status post stent placement in the proximal/mid left anterior descending artery.
Plan was made to continue aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor and folate.
It was unclear originally why the patient was not on a beta blocker.
Therefore, once his blood pressure was able to tolerate additional antihypertensives, a low dose beta blocker was added to his medication regimen.
Initially many of the patient's antihypertensive medications including Catapres and Accupril were held secondary to the questionable hemodynamic instability resulting from his right groin hematoma and blood loss anemia.
After stabilization of his intravascular volume status post multiple transfusions, and several days of monitoring, the patient was restarted on metoprolol and captopril.
Therefore the doses of the captopril and metoprolol were titrated up.
At the time of discharge the patient's blood pressure was controlled on metoprolol 100 b.i.d., lisinopril 40 q. day and hydrochlorothiazide 25 q. day.
Right groin hematoma resulting in blood loss anemia: Vascular Surgery consultation was obtained status post coronary catheterization and development of large right groin hematoma.
In the Coronary Care Unit, serial hematocrits were obtained, patient's blood pressure and hemodynamics were checked serially and peripheral pulse checks were done q. one hour.
Due to anemia secondary to blood loss, the patient required multiple blood transfusions for stabilization of his blood volume and maintenance of hematocrit greater than 30.
Initially also he was kept on bed rest with Foley catheter in place and his right leg immobilized.
His pain was treated with morphine, fentanyl and Versed initially.
After several days it was switched over to Vicodin as the patient uses Vicodin at home for control of his lower back pain.

The patient was instructed that we have changed several of his pre-hospital medications, particularly those controlling his blood pressure.
He was instructed to discard his Catapres patch, Lasix and Accupril prescriptions.
He was instructed that we have added metoprolol, lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide to his blood pressure regimen.
Additionally, he was instructed that he must take daily aspirin and Plavix for the next nine months.
He was instructed that if he misses any doses, the risk of his coronary stents occluding dramatically increases.
