The findings do not account for the symptoms   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year old woman with significant history of coronary artery disease s/p CABG, ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p BiV-ICD placement and ventricular tachycardia who presented with acute onset of likely GI bleed with resultant exertionalleft-sided chest pain.
She has history of gastritis on previous EGD and diverticulosis on prior colonoscopy.
On admission, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was started on a protonix drip, and GI was consulted who performed EGD on [**2-23**] which demonstrated no acitve site of bleeding and no lesion that may have been responsible for the GIB.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 35325**] 3 units of blood on the first day of admission which resulted in resolution of her chest pain.
Patient received full-dose aspirin and was initiated on a nitroglycerin gtt in the ED with resolution of her pain.

Beta blockade and lisinopril were initially held but were restarted at lower dose on [**2-21**].
Lisinopril however was held at the time of dc due to a Cr bump.
# Ischemic cardiomyopathy: Ms. [**Known lastname 96778**] furosemide and spironolactone were initially held given concern for GI bleed.
Before d/c her Cr was high so lasix and lisinopril were held.

# Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Home lantus and a sliding scale were continued in lieu of her januvia and sulfonyluea.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: The pt developed some orthostatic hypotension just before the time of discharge and her Cr spiked, likely in the setting of being NPO for a long period and getting lisinopril and lasix.
These meds were held at the time of dc and she will need a CHEM 7 before these meds can be restarted.
