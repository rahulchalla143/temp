Maternal history was notable for chronic hypertension, and pregnancy was complicated by progressive preeclampsia.
Mother was treated with verapamil, aldomet, and nifedipine, and received a course of betamethasone  on [**2149-11-9**] at 27 weeks.
Respiratory: Infant was treated for RDS with intubation, one dose of surfactant, and mechanical ventilation for 2 days.
She had some mild apnea of prematurity, treated with caffeine for 17 days, with gradual resolution.
Murmur persisted, and cardiology was consulted with ECHO performed on [**2150-2-3**]; ECHO was normal with no structural heart disease noted.
C. FEN/GI:  Infant was initially maintained on parenteral nutrition via a UVC, and then gradually advanced on enteral feeds.
Progression of oral feedings was slow, most likely secondary to mechanical and pain issues related to her lip [**Known lastname 68813**] (see below), but eventually, infant transitioned to all oral feedings.
By the time of discharge, she has been all PO feeding for over 5 days, taking 120-180 cc/kg/day.
Her discharge weight is 2955 grams, and she is discharged on similac 28 made with 4 calories of similac powder and 4 calories of corn oil.
She received phototherapy for 6 days and maternal blood type was A positive.
E. Infectious disease: She is status post a 48 hour course of ampicillin and gentamicin at birth.
She was treated with oral nystatin for 14 days and then fluconazole for 7 days with no improvement or change in the exudate seen.
The fluconazole was discontinued on [**2-4**].
The lip hemangioma was noted to grow rapidly, and interfere with attempts at oral feeding.
The Vascular Anomalies Center from [**Hospital3 1810**] was consulted, and the infant received an intralesional injection of steroid into her lip hemangioma on [**12-15**].
The lip lesion was treated with topical lidocaine, antimicrobial ointment, and aquaphor.
Due to continued growth of the remainder of the lip hemangioma, infant was begun on systemic steroid therapy on [**1-21**], being given Orapred 5 mg per day (2 mg/kg/day based on weight of 2.5 kg at that time).
Oral feedings began to improve as well, and she was eventually able to be transitioned to all oral feeds.
No significant side-effects of the steroid therapy related to blood pressure or blood sugar was noted.
She was begun on zantac for GI prophylaxis at the same time that the steroids were begun.
Of note, despite the improvement in the lip [**Known lastname 68813**], other small [**Known lastname 68813**] were noted to develop over the rest of her body while on the steroid therapy.
Plan at this time is to continue the current dose of orapred without adjustment for weight until 1 month of treatment (approximately [**2-21**]), and then to initiate weaning of the dose.
Of note, when she is hospitalized or is to receive major surgery, she is to receive stress dose steroids if she remains on this level of steroids daily.
Her medications include iron, Zantac 2 mg per kg per dose 3 times a day which is 5 mg every 8 hours, Orapred 5 mg once in the morning and Aquaphor to her lip as needed.
Orapred dose should be weaned beginning in early [**Month (only) 404**], and growth and vital signs should be closely monitored while on the steroid therapy.
IMMUNIZATIONS:  She received her 2 month immunizations of Pediarix, Hib, and PCV on [**2156-2-3**], and Synagis on [**2-4**].
Immunizations recommended: Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the following 3 criteria: 1.
Influenza immunization is recommended annually in the fall for all infants once they reach 6 months of age.
Before this age and for the 1st 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
