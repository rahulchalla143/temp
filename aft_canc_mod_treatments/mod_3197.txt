# BRAIN METASTASES: She presented with nausea, vomitting, and hypertension.
Her nausea and vomitting were thought to be due to her intracranial processes and changes caused by weaning from decadron and the most recent episode of whole brain radiation which the patient underwent.
She was started on 6 mg Dexamethasone every 6 hours per neurosurgery recommendations, and after discussion with the cardiology service primary medicine team, and her family, her Plavix was discontinued as the risks of intracranial bleeding was thought to outweigh the benefits of blood thinning to prevent myocardial ischemia and stent re-stenosis.
This was thought to be due to her intracranial process following weaning from decadron and also cerebral changes post-whole brain radiation.
