He has had significant issues with urinary frequency, weak stream, nighttime wakening, and bedwetting.
In addition he was quite constipated for which he took several OTC herbal medications and herbal teas (family unsure which) which led him to develop diarrhea.
Overall, he has had numerous complaints including crampy abdominal pain, cramps in his legs, generalized weakness, confusion, emotional lability, and non-specific difficulty with his vision.
Out of concern for his health, his family found information on the internet regarding low potassium levels from diarrhea and tried to feed him bananas and electrolyte-containing drinks as well as pepto-bismol.

A Foley catheter is in place within the partially distended bladder and there is a large amount of echogenic material within the bladder consistent with hemorrhage.
There is a small amount of hemorrhage at the site of right femoral line placement with no significant hematoma at that site.
Although no clear stones are identified, evaluation is severely limited due to the lack of intravenous contrast.
A dedicated CT with IV contrast is recommended for further characterization, when possible.
Enlarged prostate with irregular-appearing walls.
This area can further be assessed via CT with IV contrast as well.
Bladder collapsed around Foley catheter and not well assessed.
Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:  61 year old male with no known prior history in our system, transferred from OSH for AMS, hyperkalemia, fulminant renal failure, and hypertensive emergency.
# Subacute Obstructive Uropathy complicated by hyperkalemia and fulminant renal failure: He was admitted with poor UOP, symptoms of obstruction and overflow incontinence.
Foley was placed initially at OSH with initiation of bleeding and patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Here, he had a femoral dialysis line placed urgently and was started on dialysis overnight with immediate control of hyperkalemia and improvement of uremia.
He was continued on dialysis for multiple sessions with gradual improvement in his creatinine and uremia.
Given the persistent hydronephrosis, he had bilateral nephrostomy tubes placed.
His left tube continued to drain a substantial amount of urine daily, although the right tube averaged 150-200cc per day, which was felt to reflect decreased renal function on that side.
He no longer required dialysis for the last 1.5 weeks of hospitalization.
His foley was removed about 6 days prior to discharge and he was able to void on his own with low post-void residuals.
He did have a biopsy of his prostate that returned non-diagnostic, but given his constellation of symptoms, he was felt to have this diagnosis and it was explained to him and his family.
He had a significant amount of hematuria (see below) and underwent XRT to the prostate and completed treatment to reduce bleeding.
He was also started on Casodex.
# Gross Hematuria: He was noted to have hematuria after a difficult foley placement at OSH.
Urology was consulted and recommended continuous bladder irrigation as well as intermitted hand irrigation.
After continued gross hematuria and persistent high-level CBI requiring 20 units of pRBCs during his MICU course, he was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for cystoscopy by urology which showed bleeding prostate, with gross appearance highly suspicous for prostate cancer.
Due to persistent bleeding he was started on radiation therapy to help control bleeding, which was successful.
Following dialysis, his pressures returned to the 140-160 range systolically and he was ultimately started on labetalol for blood pressure control.
He was started on metoprolol (which was then transitioned to labetalol), his lytes were optimized by dialysis.
He remained on labetalol and chest pain free for the duration of admission.
Initially anticoagulation was held given the partial hemorrhagic conversion, but he was eventually started on SC heparin and a baby aspirin daily.
He was started on CTX and vancomycin [**5-2**] for UTI given he had low grade fever, poor mental status, WBC with a few bands and positive UA (difficult to interpret given low UOP).
All cultures negative returned negative and antibiotics were stopped after 48 hours.
His platelets and hematocrit did not fully recover.
He was transfused multiple units of blood intermittently for anemia and should have a CBC checked weekly after discharge.

11. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO DAILY (Daily).
12. labetalol 200 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
You were started on dialysis because of your kidney failure.
You had a lot of bleeding from your prostate after foley catheter was placed, so you were transfused red blood cells and platelets to try to stop the bleeding.
You had 5 sessions of radiation therapy to the prostate which helped stop the bleeding and also improved your kidney function as the radiation helped make the prostate smaller so it was not blocking the flow of urine.
You had tubes placed in both of your kidneys to help drain the urine and you soon did not need dialysis anymore.
Please see the attached medication list for all the medications you should be taking at present.
