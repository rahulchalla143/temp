He received Tylenol, demerol, Ceftriaxone for empiric coverage and Ativan in the emergency department, as well as 2-3 L of fluids.
On the day after admission, the patient was sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit following desaturations to 84% and fever to 104 degrees.
At the time, he was exhibiting hypotension despite fluids, lactic acidosis (serum lactate = 4), mental status changes, and gram negative rods in [**3-17**] blood cultures, thus meeting the definition for septic shock (SIRS + infection).
He was started on Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone and Levofloxacin, later tapered to Ceftriaxone only.
A PICC was placed on [**2105-7-26**].
He developed elevated LFT's and eosinophils on Ceftriaxone, and so the medication was stopped.
The patient was started on IV Aztreonam (Vanco, CTX and Levo were discontinued).
The latter was treated with Indomethacin.
Additionally, he was provided with a script for Bactrim DS 1 tablet [**Hospital1 **] (to be taken at the conclusion of the Erdepenam course) for 7 days.
His PICC line was pulled and the tip was cultured given the suspicion that the locus of infection was the line.
The patient was started on Vancomycin with a presumptive diagnosis of bacteremia secondary to line infection.
Blood and line cultures, however, continued to be negative throughout the hospitalization, and Vancomycin was discontinued.
ID was consulted regarding the utility of PICC placement for further IV antibiotic therapy; it was felt that an additional 3 days of IV antibiotics would not effect post-hospital course, and that re-placement of the PICC would present an unnecessary opportunity for re-infection.
The patient received one dose of Erdepenam on the day of discharge, and was sent home with a prescription for 8 additional days of Bactrim DS, 2 tablets [**Hospital1 **].
Medications on Admission: Ertapenem 1g Q8h Aztreonam 1g Q8h Bactrim (not yet started)Alprazolam Flomax Multi-vitamin Advair (occasionally used) Ambien (rarely used)  Discharge Medications: 1.
