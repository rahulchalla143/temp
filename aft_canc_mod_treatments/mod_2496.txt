#ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: He was admitted with reduced attention and impaired orientation with asterixis on exam.
Endocrine service was consulted and he was given zoledronic acid with improvement in his calcium.
His propranolol was held as this can potentially contribute to altered mental status.
He was given frequent lactulose and continued on rifaxamin with slow improvement of his mental status.
Patient received vitamin K, 1u pRBCs, 1u platelets, 1u FFP, and 1u cryoprecipitate.
This has been stable post transplant .
He was continued on cipro, omeprazole, thiamine, folate and multivitamin.
Lasix was held out of concern for hypovolemia due to high volume of diarrhea.
On [**2143-7-26**] the patient received an ABO compatible liver transplant.
He required 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, 5 units of packed red cells, 1 unit of platelets, 300 cc of Cell [**Doctor Last Name **].
He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the ICU, still intubated.
At the time of liver transplant, the patient received induction immunosuppression to include cellcept, solumedrol 500 mg intra-op with protocol taper and tacrolimus was started on the evening of POD 1.
The patients lateral drain has been removed, however the medial drain has continued with high volume output..
He was started on zoledronic acid with improvement in his calcium level.
Following transplant the calcium level was initially low.
he received one large dose infusion of calcium, and was briefly treated with calcitriol and calcium carbonate.
He was continued on prednisone and bactrim prolphylaxis.
Prednisone taper is part of immunosuppressive management.
To address post operative nutritional needs, the patient has been started on tube feedings via post pyloric feeding tube, with carbohydrate consistent oral intake and glucerna, which have been well tolerated.
The tube has required replacement due to accidental removal by patient.
Hyperkalemia: Post transplant the patient has had elevated potassium recently.
The tube feeds were changed to a low K formula and the patient was started on florinef with good results and normalization of the potassium.
Beta blocker has been increased and hold parameters lowered.
It is quite improtant for patient to receive the beta blocker on a standing basis, as he has converted in and out of AFib without it.
#T9 COMPRESSION FRACTURE: Patient is on chronic steroids though most recent DEXA was negative for osteoporosis.
He was continued on vitamin D. Continued on lidocaine patch for pain control.
Received zoledronic acid during this stay.
