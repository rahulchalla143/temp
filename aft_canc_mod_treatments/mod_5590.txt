Admission Date:  [**2176-10-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2176-11-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2109-5-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ampicillin / Penicillins / Bactrim / Lisinopril / Shellfish  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of Breath with Increased Oxygen Requirement  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Intubation 2.
Chemotherapy treatment with irinotecan.
ROS: Negative for fever, chills, rigors, night sweats, chest pain, palpitations, N/V/D.
She remains on Revatio 40 mg TID.
She continues on prednisone 10 mg QD.
Decreased T4 s/p thyroid adenoma resection 8.
Sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma, s/p L hemicolectomy with stapled colorectal anastomosis [**2175-6-9**]: mucinous adenocarcinoma (>50%) which was pT3, pN2 and M1 (stage IV) with metastatic disease to omentum and peritoneal implants.
At this time pulmonary was consulted and broad spectrum antibiotic therapy was initiated with Vancomycin, Aztreonam, Levofloxacin and Pentamidine.
Given patient's clinical picture it was felt that intubation was necessary.
Patient was intubated for hypercarbia.
Unlikely congestive heart failure as patient with nl ECHO, no signs of RV overload, only moderate pulm HTN, proBNP 1214.
Irinotecan can cause interstitial lung disease, last dose was [**9-24**]; however, more concerned that fever, new infilatate represents pulmonary infection.
She was continued on Vancomycin, Aztreonam, Levofloxacin and Pentamidine.
Increased patient's steroids to treat possible PJP.
Initial concern for ARDS as pt initally required high platuea pressures > 30; however, ARDSnet protocol was started and tidal volumes decreased.
The patient tolerated this intervention very well and her platuea pressures decreased while her ventilation improved.
She completed a 10 day course of antibiotics with vancomycin and levofloxacin.
She also was started on increased doses of steroids and tapered back to her home dose at time of discharge, to assist with any inflammatory component.
She was discharged on 2 L of nasal cannula, and may benefit from outpatient consult for sleep study (patient was noted to need more oxygen at night and reason for intubation was hypercarbia, so she could potentially benefit from CPAP, although her oxygen saturations stabalized during her stay).
#) Small bowel obstruction: Patient noted crampy abdominal pain at time of her irinotecan treatment, with much dirrahea.
A nasogastric tube was placed for decompression, and she was kept NPO.
Somatastatin was administrated.
She received TPN during the time she was kept NPO, and morphine was used for pain control.
#) Adenocarcinoma, Stage IV: Patient underwent her 6th cycle of irinotecan on [**2176-10-18**] while hospitalized, and tolerated it overall very well.
Many of her home medications were decreased in dose, and she was changed from atenolol to metoprolol as atenolol is more renally cleared.
She was discharged on nifedipime 30 mg daily; metoprolol was held due to persistently low blood pressure.
#) Hypercholesterolemia: Patient relates she was not currently on any treatment at this time.
#) Hyperglycemia: Patient had elevated blood sugars in setting of likely infection as well as steroids used for respiratory distress and chemotherapy.
This was felt to be in part due to chemotherapy effect, as well as dilutional in nature.
- Continued iron supplementation while taking POs.
- Patient received red blood cell transfusions for her anemia while hospitalized.
