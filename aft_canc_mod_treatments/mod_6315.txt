She then developed a-fib with RVR that was suppressed with verapamil and metoprolol.
She was discharged to her group home acute care facility and recommended to have entire excision of her egg-sized left axillary lymph node for further diagnosis.
She now represents with tachypnea and increased oxygen requirement.
She has needed intermittent oxygen and occasionally refuses it.
The patient has history of tachypnea during her last hospitalization that resolved with sitting up (may have been mechanical from her large abdomen/ileus) and with nebulizer treatments.
At [**Hospital3 1196**] ED she received solumedrol 125mg once, sasix 20mg IV once, zosyn 1 dose.
She was in normal sinus rhythm and had a negative first set of cardiac enzymes.
Past Medical History: - h/o mediastinal mass and diffuse lymphadenopathy; s/p FNA, diagnosis unclear - h/o pericardial effusion s/p drainage; path/cytology inconclusive - h/o paroxysmal a-fib w/ RVR s/p pericardiocentesis; no anticoagulation 2/2 blood pericardial effusion - Mental retardation of unknown etiology.
- h/o ileus requiring occasional rectal tube - Status post volvulus and colonic resection.

[**2144-8-5**] Direct Antigen Test for HSV Types 1 & 2 (lip): Positive for Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 by direct antigen staining.
Pancreas and adrenal glands and kidneys remain unremarkable.
Slight interval improvement in patient's known anterior mediastinal mass, and bilateral supraclavicular and axillary lymphadenopathy.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged due to position of the patient and technique.
Left PICC tip is in unchanged position in the proximate SVC.
[**2144-9-15**] KUB INDICATION: Patient is 59-year-old female with history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma status post chemotherapy with recurrent problems of ileus and C. diff colitis, now presenting with increased abdominal distention and no bowel movement for the past 32 hours.
There is a left subclavian central venous catheter in place.

Brief Hospital Course: 59yoF with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple medical problems including mental retardation, PAF with RVR, and chronic ileus.
She suffered from recurrent cardiac tamponade with hemodynamic compromise recurrently during her long hospitalization, ultimately requiring placement of a pericardial window into the L pleural space.
She underwent urgent treatment with EACOP (no bleomycin due to low pulmonary reserve and no vincristine due to GI toxicity in a patient w/ paralytic ileus).
Doxarubacin and Cytoxan on Day #1 ([**7-21**]) and Etoposide on Day 1,2,3.
14 days of Dexamethasone 20mg daily.
Also given procarbazine ([**7-28**] and [**7-29**]) which was discontinued one day early due to significant neutropenia and ileus with concern for bowel obstruction.
Patient became neutropenic on [**7-30**] and was restarted on G-CSF for remaining two days of therapy.
Spiked temperature over 101 on [**7-31**] and was started on Cefepime and Vancomycin (day 1=[**7-31**]).
Flagyl was started on [**7-31**] as pt was found to have GNR in [**2-14**] blood cultures.
Due to decreasing concern for gram positive infection, Vancomycin was D/C'ed with last dose being on [**8-2**].
With day 1 being [**8-6**], patient was initiated on Acyclovir 400 mg PO BID with plan for 10 total days followed by suppressive regimen.
GND was started as a consolidation regimen on the BMT unit on [**2144-8-17**].
She was restarted on Amiodarone IV and spontaneously converted to NSR.
An echo was obtained which showed RV and RA collapse w tamponade physiology.
She tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
Approximately 150 cc of clear fluid was removed and sent for cytology.
Following the operation she was brought to the CVICU for monitoring.
She was maintained on Amiodarone and beta blockade for intermittent atrial fibrillation.
TPN was continued for her chronic ileus.
Her mediastinal chest tube was eventually removed on [**8-31**].
She was maintained on TPN and her cardiac medications.
A rectal tube was placed on [**2144-9-5**] to help keep her sacral area dry and clean and assist wound healing.
Therefore, she underwent 3 days of ICE chemotherapy, and at discharge is on day 5 after ICE began.
She will likely need more cycles of treatment with this therapy about every 21 to 28 days.
TACHYPNEA AND HYPOXIA:  Found on chest CT to have tumor causing compression not only of her SVC but also of her pulmonary arteries bilaterally which would cause the same V/Q mismatch as a PE would by decreasing her perfusion.
Treatment was directed towards the underlying cause, she received chemotherapy for her Hodgkin's lymphoma as above and underwent a R sided thoracentesis 1.1 liters removed.
She was intubated x 3 days due to increased PaCO2 of 80 and somnolence- this increase in PCO2 was possibly due to patient tiring versus L main stem bronchus compression; however her mental status significantly improved.
After initiation of chemotherapy and thoracentesis she was able to be extubated, her mental status was much improved, her O2 requirement was down from 95% face mask to 6L NC and her tachypnea resolved.
She required 2L nasal canula for 2 days, and then no longer required oxygen therapy.
Treated initially with a dilt and esmolol drip; subsequently she was loaded with IV amiodarone and dilt drip was discontinued, her atrial fibrillation reverted to sinus rhythm and the IV amiodarone was stopped.
She was transitioned to po Lopressor 12.5mg tid, which was uptitrated to 25mg TID due to persistent and intermittent RVR.
CTA negative for PE but a fib with RVR more frequent and more difficult to control prior to chemotherapy and may have been due to pulmonary artery compression causing physiology similar to PE.
She then developed afib during her first neutropenic fever on [**7-31**] to rates in the low 200s, reduced only to the 150s with 3 doses of 10mg IV diltiazem.
She was started on an amiodarone gtt with the hope of maintaining NSR however she developed bradycardia with the IV infusion and it was stopped.
After stopping the amiodarone on [**7-31**] the pt reverted back to afib with HR 110s-120s but broke again with IVF.
Off of amiodarone IV, patient's rate rose to 190 on [**8-4**].
IV amiodarone loading was continued in separate sessions over the next several days.
Metoprolol 25mg QID was initiated on [**8-5**].
Amiodarone IV infusion was stopped on evening of [**8-6**] and patient was started on amiodarone 400 mg PO BID.
In brief, at that time she became hypotensive and tachycardia and was found to have Afib with RVR as well as cardiac tamponade.
Her rate and rhythm were controlled with amiodarone and metoprolol and her tamponade was treated with a pericardial window.
Rectal tube was inserted per surgery recs then removed on [**8-5**] as patient began passing flatus and stooling spontaneously.
She was switched to NPO and started on TPN with tap water enemas per GI recommendations on [**2144-8-18**].
The distension slowly resolved and she has continued TPN until several days before discharge, at which time she is able to eat small soft meals.
Her ileus has been previously relieved with repositioning the patient and then rectal tube placement for a short time.
However, given her many risk factors for DVT she was maintained on PPx dose of heparin SC.
She was found to be C diff toxin positive and started on metronidazole on [**2144-8-9**].
Her leukocytosis resolved within days of treatment but her diarrhea continued.
She was switched to oral vancomycin on [**2144-9-5**] with ID approval.
To assist in healing of her sacral ulcer a rectal tube was placed on [**2144-9-5**].
Her vaginal irritation improved with placement of a Foley catheter on [**2144-8-17**].
She also suffered from very significant HSV of her mouth, lips, and vagina.
As of [**2144-8-20**] she was dramatically improved and has since been maintained on suppressive acyclovir with good effect.
It is worth noting that the Pt obsessively picks at her skin and need frequent reinforcement not to do so.
UTI: On [**2144-9-6**] she began having a leukocytosis (WBC to 18) and was febrile.
She was initially started on amoxicillin for 1 day, then when sensitives returned was stated on linezolid for VRE infection.
She then had another urine culture showing a UTI with E. coli and she was started on ceftriaxone.
She will need treatment until [**2144-9-19**].
Of note, a UA was being followed while on ICE therapy to monitor for hematuria, which was negative.
While on TPN she received insulin in her TPN.
After her TPN was stopped she had one episode of hypoglycemia with BG of 47, which was increased to 147 after a [**2-12**] amp of dextrose.
Her sliding scale has now been changed to be less aggressive and she has no longer had hypoglycemia.
Was also given lasix 20mg extra with her blood.
Her retic count is pending and haptoglobin was 320.
She may need further transfusions.
She was started on G-CSF last night.
