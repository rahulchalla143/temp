Study Date of [**2117-4-22**] 1:48 PM Uncomplicated percutaneous placement of a 12 Fr Wills-Ogelsby G-tube.
Feedings may be started through the tube in the morning of [**4-23**].
Some of this apparent shift may be due to the combination of scoliosis and mild obliquity of the patient   Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted from OSH with recurrent left pleural effusions s/p thoracentesis showing hemothorax.
Patient was given vitamin k for an INR of 6 (on coumadin for afib) in preparation of surgery.
We continued levoflox which was started at the OSH for likely CAP.
Patient underwent left VATS partial pulmonary decortication with parietal pleurectomy on [**2117-4-16**].
Two left chest tubes were placed.
Patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the PACU in stable condition.
Patient tolerated the procedure well without bradycardia or desat.
The rest of the hospital course is summarized by systems below:  Neuro:  Patient was initially given IV narcotics post op but then quickly transitioned to standing PO tylenol.
Patient did not show any significant signs of delirium despite his prolonged SICU stay and multiple medical problems.
Patient was kept NPO for concern of aspiration.
Patient was started on nebs, mucomyst, and aggressive pulmonary toilet with nasopharyngeal suctioning.
Two interrupted stitches were placed over CT wound.
On POD7, Vanc and zosyn were started despite previous negative cultures given high probability of LLL aspiration PNA.
He continued to have difficulty clearing his airway, requiring excessive nasopharyngeal suctioning with 1:1 nursing care.
We recommended a tracheostomy, but patient and family wanted to defer at the time and give him a chance to recover.
Patient did require lasix intermittently for mild volume overload as evidenced by exam and pulmonary edema on CXRs.
Patient tolerating tube feeds with low residuals.
Renal:  Patient has CRI with baseline Cr 1.8-2.
ID:  Patient continued on levoflox on admission for CAP.
Levoflox was stopped on POD2.
Patient was started on vanc/zosyn POD7 given persistent LLL consolidation concerning for aspiration PNA despite prior negative BALs.
His incisions were without erythema or significant drainage.
Heme:  Patient required vit k preop for an INR of 6 on admission.
He received FFP and platelets perioperatively.
Post op patient continued to have elevated INR requiring vit k supplementation.
They agreed that his elevated INR was likely related to severe nutritional deficiency requiring vit k supplements and TFs.
He received 2u platelets and 1uPRBCs POD9 given anemia and a small amount of hemoptysis following suctioning.
