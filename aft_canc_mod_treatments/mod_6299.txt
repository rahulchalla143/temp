HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This infant was born weighing 899 grams, the product of a 27 week gestation, born to a 28 year-old, prima parous woman after pregnancy that was apparently uncomplicated until the week prior to birth when the mother noticed whitish vaginal discharge.
She was given betamethasone and antibiotics as well as tocolysis with nifedipine.
There were concerns for abnormalities of fetal heart rate, prompting a Cesarean section for delivery.
The infant was given facial CPAP followed by intubation for increased work of breathing.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  Respiratory:  The infant had respiratory distress syndrome and required 2 doses of Surfactant therapy.
He weaned to CPAP on day of life one and remained on CPAP until [**2130-2-19**], at which time, he weaned to a nasal cannula on room air.
He was started on caffeine citrate for apnea of prematurity prior to extubation on [**2130-1-11**] and weaned off caffeine on [**2130-3-3**].
He was treated with Indocin and had a follow-up echocardiogram on [**2130-1-16**] which showed a very tiny PDA and a tiny, muscular VSD.
A central PICC line was placed on [**2130-1-14**].
Enteral feedings were initiated on [**2130-2-8**].
The infant achieved full enteral feedings on [**2130-1-26**].
The infant required a red blood cell transfusion on [**2130-1-24**] for a hematocrit of 25 at that time.
The infant was started on ampicillin and gentamicin and completed a 7 day course of ampicillin and gentamicin.
The infant also was given triple antibiotic ointment for breakdown in the nares while on CPAP which has since resolved.
On [**2040-2-22**] he was treated with Keflex for thick nasal secretions, thought to be secondary to long term nasal CPAP.
