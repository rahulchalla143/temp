Pt was started on Heparin and then bridged to Lovenox.
He was discharged on long term lovenox given his malignancy.
He will have an IVC filter placed as below - given his need for endobronchial stent next week.
#Possible Pneumonia: pt received broad spectrum antibiotics for HCAP and was later switched to Levofloxacin when his pneumonia was no longer concerning for HCAP.
Mr [**Known lastname 34030**] will also follow up with interventional pulmonary next week, and as he has an endobronchial lesion that will require treatment to avoid lung collapse.
# Code: Confirmed Full code  Follow up plans: Mr. [**Known lastname 34030**] will follow up next week for IVC filter placement and endobronchial lesion stenting with interventional pulmonary.
