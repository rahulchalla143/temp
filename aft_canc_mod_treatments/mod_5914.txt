The patient reportedly began radiation and chemotherapy two weeks prior to admission, over which period she noted gradually diminishing energy.
Metastatic melanoma with metastases to the brain and retroperitoneal and inguinal lymph nodes, now status post right parietal and left temporal resection.
Endometriosis status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
ALLERGIES:   Penicillin and codeine.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Department, the patient underwent a plain chest radiograph which demonstrated an interval increase in the size of her cardiac silhouette as compared to prior film obtained on [**2101-5-17**].
The patient was sent to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for a pericardiocentesis; the procedure was performed without complications and resulted in the drainage of approximately 730 cc.
A pericardial drainage was left in place and the patient was subsequently transferred back to the Coronary Care Unit.
Although the finalized results of this pericardial tap cytology are still pending at the time of this dictation, sufficient evidence existed at the time of drainage to suspect that the patient's pericardial effusion was malignant in nature and an Oncology consultation was obtained.
On hospital day number three, the patient's pericardial drain was removed without complications.
Following a thorough evaluation of the patient and review of her assorted studies, the patient was recommended for a combined thoracoscopy, drainage of right pleural effusion and pericardial window.
On [**2101-6-10**], the patient therefore underwent a left sided thoracoscopy with a concomitant left pleurodesis and pericardial window.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and required one liter of fluid intraoperatively with minimal associated blood loss.
