Brief Hospital Course: 67 year-old W with hypertension, diabetes mellitus II, history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, pulmonary embolism, porcine mitral valve replacement and coronary artery disease status-post CABG ([**2112**]) complicated by chronic sternal wound infection with multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas and Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase E Coli who presented from rehab with fever and was found to have ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia, and MDR Pseudomonas in her sternal wound.
She was placed on IV colisitin.
On [**8-20**] she went for surgical debridement of her chronic wound by Plastic Surgery.
Daptomycin was added for increased antibiotic coverage, but then removed after the patient improved relatively quickly with little intervention except for hydration, then lasix, and metoprolol for heart rate control.
Given the resistance profile she was started on IV [**Last Name (LF) 111095**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] Infectious Disease recommendations.
Plastic Surgery was concerned for possible gallbladder pathology and requested a RUQ ultrasound, which revealed a midly thick gallbladder with mobile gallstone and no other evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Given that the wound was the likely source of her bacteremia, she underwent debridement on [**8-20**] by Plastic Surgery with subsequent wound vac placement.
She was continued on IV colisitin for two weeks following debridement (last day [**2114-9-4**]).
Plastic Surgery performed regular wound vac changes.
Her pain was controlled with 0.5 of IV morphine.
She will need continued wound vac changes twice weekly.
# Anticoagulation: Given her history of venous thromboembolisms while on Coumadin, mitral valve replacement, and history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, the patient was placed on an argatroban drip prior to and after her surgical procedure.
She was then re-started on Coumadin after transfer to the floor.
On discharge she was on Coumadin 2 mg daily, given at 4PM.
We have held her lasix (normal dose Furosemide 20 mg PO daily) and lisinopril (normal dose 5 mg PO daily).
She will need monitoring of her kidney function by repeat creatinine measurements, and likely future re-initiation of her anti-hypertensives once her volume status corrects and kidney injury resolves.
Also, the patient has needed frequent repletion of her potassium and magnesium during her hospitalization, likely due to poor nutritional status and being on diuretics.
She will need monitoring of her electrolytes, and supplementation as needed, upon arrival to the skilled nursing facility.
She likely had appreciable [**Date Range **] loss from her surgical site, as the wound vac output was sanguinous.
Her hematocrit never fell below 21%, but given her cardiac history, and physiologic signs such as tachycardia, as well as endorsed dyspnea, she received one unit of packed red [**Date Range **] cells on two separate occasions, and responded appropriately.
# Malnutrition: The patient was assessed by Nutrition who recommended tube feeds.
The patient was [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 5439**] [**Last Name (un) **] Hoff tube placement for supplementation on three separate occasions and refused.
She responded well to ipratropium nebulizers.
She was provided regular accuchecks and placed on an insulin sliding scale.
She rarely needed insulin during this admission.
We are not discharging her on any medications for management of diabetes; when she presented to the hospital from rehab she was not on any agents either.
She was kept on metoprolol 25 TID.
Lasix and Lisinopril have been recently held (as explained above).
She is being discharged on daily aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker.
# Depression/Anxiety: Continued lorazepam and aripiprazole.
# Prophylaxis: The patient did not receive heparin products during this admission.
She received a temporary argatroban drip, then re-initated on coumadin and wore pneumatic boots.
No baseline home O2 requirement  Medications on Admission: 1.
Lisinopril 20 mg daily 2.
Metoprolol Succinate 150 mg daily 3.
Furosemide 20 mg daily 4.

You received antibiotics and had a surgery to remove some of the infected tissue from your sternal wound.
Importantly, we are holding some of your [**Known lastname **] pressure medications (Furosemide 20 daily and Lisinopril 5 daily).
Additionally, you will need close monitoring of your INR and coumadin dosing.
You will also need to have wound vac changes twice weekly.
Please keep your follow up appointments with the Infectious Disease and Plastic Surgery doctors.
