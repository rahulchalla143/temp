A right-sided chest tube terminating in the pleural space on the right lung base remain in unchanged position.
[**2191-4-9**]: Improved aeration in right lung compared with earlier the same day However, considerable persistent opacity diffusely throughout right lung, which appears to represent a combination of diffuse alveolar opacity and pleural thickening and/or fluid.
Unchanged small left and tiny right pleural effusions [**2191-4-3**]:  The patient is status post right upper lobe resection.

Diltiazem was started for RVR and titated too 30 mg qid.
He converted to sinus rhythm [**2191-4-3**] 50-60's on amiodarone and diltiazem and remained in sinus.
Amiodarone and diltiazem were titrated in relationship to HR and systolic blood pressure with patient intermittently alternating between afib and sinus rhythm.
