Admission Date:  [**2110-7-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-8-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2049-6-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**] Chief Complaint: Decreased sensation and weakness in lower extremities, stool incontinence, and urinary retention for initial admission, hypoxia for his ICU transfer  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Elective intubation for CT and MRI scans Elective intubation for push enteroscopy S/p laminectomy x2 and hemilaminectomy x2 push enteroscopy EGD Capsule endoscopy TLC placement in RIJ  History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname 24347**] is a 61 y/o male with prior history of multiple myeloma s/p chemo and XRT to pelvis, who presented to ED on [**7-4**] with decreased sensation and weakness in his lower extremities, stool incontinence, and urinary retention.
His post-operative course has been complicated by upper extremity DVT, for which he was started on heparin gtt.
He was initially placed on high flow nasal cannula without significant response, and subsequently required 100% non-rebreather mask to maintain sats in the low 90s.
He was written for fluconazole, acyclovir, SS bactrim, and 40 mg IV lasix.
He reported worsening shortness of breath, and frustration at the prospect of transfer to the ICU.
He felt that he had not been eating and receiving pain medications on time, and that is why his oxygen level was low.
He denies chest pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
The patient was started on XRT to bonysites of disease in the pelvis and chemotherapy(velcade/revlimid/dex per outside notes).
Since that time patient has tolerated therapy well and reports a significant improvement in symptoms.
During this hospitalization, in addition to the above spinal imaging, he also received a CT of his chest, which revealed multiple pulmonary nodules, concerning for metastatic disease   Past Medical History: - Multiple hospitalizations in Spring [**2110**]  -hospitalized from [**Date range (1) 88502**] at [**Last Name (un) 1724**] with shingles requiring high dose acyclovir and analgesia, as well as PNA with resultant bandemia and hypotension requiring ICU admission, treated with 5 days vanco and azithromycin, and seven days pip/tazo  -hospitalized at [**Last Name (un) 1724**] [**Date range (1) 88503**], with E coli, PCP and [**Date range (1) 1074**] pneumonia; was initially treated with Bactrim, but experienced thrombocytopenia and was switched to atovaquone - DVTs status post IVC filter placement - HTN - HL - Disc herniation with sciatica - CAD, s/p stent x2 - Hypothyroidism - Prior R rotator cuff repair - R knee arthroscopic surgery - Appendectomy age 17   Social History: +1-1.5 PPD since age 15.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is widened and a right-sided PICC line tip appears to overlie the SVC/RA junction.
Right adrenal lesion, not characterized as adenoma.
Diffuse lymphadenopathy and soft tissue nodules within the mediastinum, parasternal region, posterior cervical region, retroperitoneum, pelvis, and gluteal region, as described above.
Spine MRI - multiple studies, see OMR  Brief Hospital Course: Prior to patient's ICU courses, the patient underwent laminectomy x2 and hemilaminectomy x2 and he was subsequently transferred to the BMT unit for further management of his multiple myeloma.
61 y/o M with past multiple myeloma treated with chemo and XRT, multiple hospital admissions for pneumonia in recent months, now admitted on [**7-5**] for lower extremity paralysis related to spinal cord involvement, c/b upper extremity DVT, and newly found lung nodules concerning for malignancy, now s/p biopsy.
First ICU Course: Hypoxia improved within hours, with the patient weaning from a non-rebreather to room air in less than 12 hours.
He received RBC transfusions and his heparin was stopped, with subsequent improvement in his hct.
GI was consulted and performed upper endoscopy and capsule endoscopy, neither of which revealed active bleed.
He was scheduled to start radiation therapy but was unable to lie flat due to back pain.
He developed asymmetric left hand weakness, was seen by neurology, and underwent MRI of brachial plexus and cervical spine, showing posterior fluid collection between C5-T2.
He was followed by the pain service for his significant LBP, and he was started on bortezomib chemotherapy.
Additional CT finding of ground-glass opacities c/f PNA improved on more recent CT. Pt is at risk for PE with known DVTs, hematologic malignancy, & recent interruption in systemic anticoagulation for lung biopsy; heparin was started but stopped when the pt developed dropping Hct with guaiac positive stools suspicious for GI bleed (see below).
Beta-glucan, galactomannan and PCP PCR labs were pending at time of transfer.
He was treated empirically with an 8 day course of vancomycin and zosyn, 5 days azithromycin, 6 days fluconazole (ongoing), 6 days acyclovir (ongoing), and bactrim prophylaxis was started.
#GI bleed Pt suffered a 6-point Hct drop during first ICU admission -- suspected source was upper GI bleed given coincident melanotic stools.
Plan from GI was to prep patient for a colonoscopy in the near future if the capsule study is negative, but this did not happen as patient's Hct stabilized at baseline 27 and melanotic stools resolved.
# Spinal cord compression/paralysis: S/p laminectomy x2 and hemilaminectomy x2, without subsequent improvement in extremity strength/sensation.
We continued him on his corticosteroids and frequently repositioned to avoid skin breakdown.
Orthospine service monitored the patient in the ICU; staples were removed and post-surgical site appeared clean.
Pain service was involved in pain management; initially controlled on IV methadone, pt was transitioned to tylenol, lidocaine patch, and dilaudid PCA.
At time of transfer he was on a dexamethaxone taper with dilaudid PCA for pain management.
After his lung biopsy on [**7-11**], heparin gtt was restarted.
Anticoagulation was stopped in the context of Hct drop/suspected GI bleed.
He was ultimately able to receive the full course of 5 radiation treatments to C5-C7, last dose received [**2110-7-31**].
WBC trending down, 23.3 at time of transfer, s/p several days of broad-spectrum antibiotics including antivirals and antifungals.
Pt afebrile but pt on standing tylenol.
Not listed as taking beta blocker as outpatient despite CAD.
Continued amlodipine and furosemide in ICU.
# GI bleed: Transferred from BMT unit for melanotic stool and tachycardia with a Hct 21, requiring 3U PRBC on the day of transfer to maintain Hct >25.
Pt required intubation for push enteroscopy which did not identify any bleeding source.
Empiric antibiotic therapy with Vancomycin /Zosyn /Acyclovir was continued.
Vanc/Zosyn were stopped given serial negative sputum and blood cultures were negative but restarted when pt spiked fevers to 102-103; sputum cultures sent at that time grew GPC and GNR.
He was also continued on Voriconazole for yeast+ sputum cultures; this was transiently changed to micofungin but changed back to voriconazole when patient's respiratory status further deteriorated after the GI procedure.
Pt was placed on TB precautions and started on empiric therapy for TB/[**Doctor First Name **] (isoniazid, rifampin, ethanbutol, moxifloxacin, azithromycin).
Studies were also negative for the PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1074**] (and other viral studies); given acyclovir-induced crystal nephropathy was within the differential when the patient became anuric (see below), acyclovir was also stopped when tests returned negative.
He received supplemental oxygen and nebulizers with O2 saturation >90% until elective intubation for a GI procedure (see below).
#Elective intubation: Patient underwent elective intubation for GI push enteroscopy.
Following the procedure he had persistent respiratory acidosis and was not able to be extubated.
Maintained primarily on pressure support ventilation; took in large tidal volumes with some improvement in his acidosis.
The patient did not require sedation on the ventilator.
Other possible diagnoses, per Renal, are various types of "obstructive uropathy" including myeloma cast nephropathy and acute acyclovir crystallopathy.
Per renal recs, repleted the patient intravascularly with 25% albumin solution and monitored the patient's CVP.
He also received significant albumin load via multiple blood product transfusions during this time.
Following elective intubation, patient initially required a fentanyl drip for sedation.
However, his mental status gradually declined such that he did not require sedation on the vent, and on examination was unresponsive and unable to follow commands.
At the time he remained intubated on mechanical ventilation, continued to be anuric and anasarcic, and continued to spike tylenol-nonresponsive fevers to 102 on vancomycin/ zosyn/ micofungin and empiric antibiotics for AFB.
Melanotic stools and dropping Hct continued to require blood and platelet transfusion.
All pain and sedating medications were held.
All meds were checked for renal dosing and non-essential medications were stopped, including empiric TB antibiotics (AFB negative smears x3).
# Multiple myeloma: Previously started bortezomib therapy and had completed XRT.
# DVT: Unable to treat multiple known thromboses given active GI bleed requiring RBC transfusions.
# Spinal cord mets s/p decompressive laminectomies: Path consistent with plasma cell metastases.
Continued management with pain control and dexamthasone; all pain medications were stopped when patient's mental status changed as above.
# Chronic back pain: Patient's prior pain regimen of acetaminophen, gabapentin, dilaudid PCA, tizanidine, and lidoderm were continued upon transfer to the ICU.
When the patient was intubated, his oral pain regimen and PCA were held, and pain control was continued with Fentanyl PCA.
All pain meds including gabapentin and fentanyl were stopped when his mental status changed (as above).
Pt developed hypoglycemia to 40s, which started while NPO prior to GI procedure.
Tubefeeds were started after patient was intubated on mechanical ventilation.
# Hypertension: Home amlodipine was discontinued in the setting of GI bleed.
