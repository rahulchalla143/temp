Morphine 2mg IV x one.
Acquired FVIII inhibitor - dx [**12-9**], also found to have positive lupus anticoagulant   Social History: Patient lives alone currently.
He was treated with recombinant factor VII infusions and immunosuppression and was discharged after weaning factor replacement.
This was his first significant bleed since his diagnosis, and he was subsequently started on recombinant factor VII infusions to prevent cord compression.
His hematoma remained stable on serial MRIs.
Acquired Hemophilia: He received a diagnosis of acquired hemophilia A secondary to factor VIII inhibitor in [**Month (only) **] of [**2105**].
His factor infusions were incrementally spaced apart, however intermittent findings of peripheral bruising delayed weaning at several points during his month-long hospitalization.
With regards to factor suppression, he was continued on high dose prednisone at 60mg daily, and cytoxan, initially 150mg daily which was uptitrated to 200mg daily.
Chronic steriod use: The patient was placed on Bactrim MWF for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
Due to the development of leukopenia thought to be secondary to bactrim, he began atovaquone 1500mg daily for PCP prophylaxis prior to discharge.
He was also started on daily PPI as well as calcium/vit D supplementation.
Due to persistent hypokalemia requiring daily repletion, he was started on supplementation on discharge.
He was maintained on an insulin sliding scale during his hospitalization, though this was discontinued due to adequate control in the 100s.
Tachycardia improved with hematocrit stability.
Leukopenia:  He developed leukopenia to 2.5 which was thought to be secondary to bactrim marrow suppression.
He was started on atovaquone instead for PCP prophylaxis instead, and his WBC increased to 3.1 at the time of discharge.
Hypertension:  he was started on lisinopril 5mg daily for hypertension  INACTIVE ISSUES: 9.
