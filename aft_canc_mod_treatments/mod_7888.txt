After a non-diagnostic liver biopsy during a previous admission, she ultimately decided to pursue palliative care and eschew further efforts at biopsy to obtain a diagnosis.
She was given dilt 120 mg PO x1 to treat the a-fib which had increased in rate to 140s.
She briefly required non-invasive ventilation in the ED for roughly one hour.
she was admitted to MICU for further evaluation.
Lung cancer:    - T3 N0 large cell s/p R pneumonectomy in [**2191-12-20**] 2.
Breast cancer:    - Ductal carcinoma in situ (left breast) s/p lumpectomy in [**2177**] 3.
Occasional alcohol use,  smoked 2 packs per day x 30 yrs prior to lung Ca  Family History: Mother with breast cancer 74, diabetes in mother  Physical Exam: VS: Temp: 98.4  BP: 126/68   HR: 83  RR: 22  O2sat: 92 50% VM GEN: awake, alert, comfortable appearing on face mask oxygen HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, MMM, op without lesions NECK: no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd, RESP: Absent breath sounds on R, prolong exp phase on L with minimal wheezing.
PE is a consideration particularly given the risk factor of CA, although although with treatment of COPD the patient returned to her home O2 requirement so CTA chest deferred as alternative Dx more likely.
Treated initially with solumedrol then transitioned to prednison to complete 5 day course (40-30-20-10-5-off), azithromycin day [**3-24**], nebulizers as needed.
She also responded well to morphine for subjective dyspnea.
CHADS 3 so would benefit from anticoagulation but risk of bleeding likely outweighs mortality from metastatic lung CA so coumdain not started.
Continued on ASA 81mg daily and diltiazem for rate control.
Lung CA with liver and bone Lesions: These likely represent metastases.
Pt has decided in the past not to pursue further diagnostics given that she had no intentions of undergoing chemotherapy, radiation or surgery except for palliation.
Diabetes mellitus: Was recently discharged with increased glargine (8 -> 10units), and this was uptitrated in setting of steroids.
