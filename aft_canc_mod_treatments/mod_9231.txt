History of Present Illness: The patient is a 74 year old male with a history of CLL diagnosed five years ago, status post fludarabine times one year complicated by AIHA, then switched to chlorambucil plus prednisone with the former discontinued secondary to decreasing platelets in [**2116-6-13**].
The patient presented to [**Hospital6 7486**] emergency room on Wednesday with complaints of nausea and vomiting times one and diarrhea times three.
In the emergency room he was given intravenous fluids, Solu-Medrol 200 mg IV, suspecting ITP versus leukemic transformation and levofloxacin.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 4242**] emergency room via ambulance for further management.
In the emergency room he had bright red blood per rectum times two and significant hematuria complicated by clot retention and difficult Foley placement necessitating urology consult.
A 14 French coude was placed.
He was given one unit of packed red blood cells and a six pack of platelets as well as IVIG for presumed ITP and transferred to the Fennard ICU.
BPH status post TURP  Hypercholesterolemia   Social History: Lives with wife on [**Hospital3 1076**].
Early differential diagnosis for thrombocytopenia included medication or chemo effect, ITP, TTP, HUS, sequestration or viral infection.
The patient was initially given IVIG 1 gm per kg and was maintained on Solu-Medrol 200 mg q.d.
He was given a four day course of Decadron 40 mg q.d.
The patient was treated with Rituxan and also with vincristine.
The patient was seen in consultation by surgery for the possibility of splenectomy, but splenectomy was low on the list of possibilities, given the lack of response to IVIG, steroids and the surgical risks, given his platelet count.
For several days he had hematuria with the foley associated with his low platelet count.
Once the Foley was changed and the counts were kept at a level above 50, the hematuria resolved.
His foley was removed on [**8-6**] without bleeding or other complications.
Vincristine and Rituxan given during this admission was not for treatment of CLL, but rather for ITP.
Based on bone marrow biopsy, treatment for CLL was not initiated.
Pt has a history of BPH and urinary retention, so foley placement was attempted which caused bleeding.
He was started on Flomax and Proscar at this time.
Urology changed the foley and the hematuria resolved on [**7-31**].
On [**8-6**] the foley was removed without complications and the patient was able to void.
The patient will stay on Flomax and Proscar as an outpatient for treatment of his BPH.
6) Hyperglycemia:  The patient was placed on an insulin sliding scale while receiving high dose steroids.
Once his platelet count returns to normal, he can be restarted on this medication.
