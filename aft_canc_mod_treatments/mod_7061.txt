HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 46-year-old female with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma that was diagnosed at the age of 17 and was treated with MOPP and radiation therapy to the left lung which resulted in progressive fibrosis.
She was admitted to [**Hospital6 733**] Medicine for diuresis on [**2142-3-3**] and became increasingly dyspneic and disoriented that night with an arterial blood gas with a pH of 7.27, PCO2 of 86, and a PO2 of 81 requiring transfer to the Intensive Care Unit.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at home included estrogen 0.625 mg p.o.
Nasal cannula was in place.
She was started on digoxin and Aldactone.
The patient was placed on levofloxacin for a presumed pneumonia/tracheal bronchitis.
She was continued on diuresis at this point but was switched to furosemide for a rash that seemed to be due to the spironolactone.
She was continued on furosemide at approximately 20 mg p.o.
As an outpatient, she should continue the [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure regimen to help improve her hypercarbia at baseline with PCO2 noted probably in the 60s to 70s.
This was thought to coincide with the initiation of Aldactone for diuresis.
Furosemide 20 mg p.o.
Docusate sodium 100 mg p.o.
Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o.
Hydroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg p.o.
Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously q.12h.
Estrogen conjugated 0.625 mg p.o.
Lung fibrosis secondary to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
The patient was to have a intensive physical therapy with her oxygen at 1 liter per minute on nasal cannula until she can be weaned off this.
