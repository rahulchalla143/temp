HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had routine labs ordered as well as CT scan of the head and C-spine.
A Foley catheter was placed with a minimal amount of urine retrieved.
The CT scan demonstrated thickened small bowel, and large amount of ascites (of note, the patient was severely hypoalbuminemic of uncertain etiology).
She was continued to be resuscitated and had received approximately 7 liters of crystalloid at this time.
The patient was brought to the surgical intensive care unit  and rigid sigmoidoscopy was performed but the colon could not be seen proximally.
However at the rectosigmoid junction there was an area of congested purple appearance of the bowel that felt circumferentially firm and worrisome for malignancy.
The patient underwent a colectomy and Hartmann's procedure and was transferred back to the ICU on multiple pressors.
Unfortunately these improvements were short lived and she progressively deteriorated developing refractory hypotension and acidosis requiring maximal amounts of vasopressor and Levophed to maintain adequate blood pressure.
