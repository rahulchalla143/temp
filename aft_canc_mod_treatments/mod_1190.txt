She was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 1444**] to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2192-5-25**], after undergoing placement of an Ommaya reservoir for intrathecal chemotherapy (left frontal ventricular access).
This has not leaked since, but she does have a lodged area under her scalp which is most likely cerebrospinal fluid, which required no further treatment at that time.
She developed a methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus urinary tract infection and a full workup for this also revealed positive methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus in her right eye.
She began intravenous vancomycin on [**6-21**].
Other active issues at the time of transfer included a clogged gastrojejunostomy tube which was unclogged in Interventional Radiology on [**6-25**].
Upon transfer to O-Med on [**6-25**], her history is as follows: Her history is now most significant for neutropenia (white blood cells of 0.4 with an absolute neutrophil count of 320), methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus urinary tract infection on intravenous vancomycin, and hyponatremia secondary to serum-inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.
Her sodium had decreased to 125 on [**6-21**] to 21, but it slowly trended upward with fluid restriction and sodium tablets to 133 on the day of transfer.
Breast cancer, metastatic to brain and leptomeninges; diagnosed in [**2192-2-3**] when she presented with arm cellulitis that did not respond to intravenous antibiotics.
An MRI showed metastases to the brain (the right posterior temporal lobe and right cerebellum and leptomeninges).
She began treatment with Decadron and whole body radiation for ten days.
An Ommaya reservoir was placed on [**2192-5-21**].
In this month, she also was diagnosed with serum-inappropriate antidiuretic hormone associated with mental status changes.
They then began chemotherapy (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2192-5-22**].
She was started on adriamycin weekly and intrathecal thiotepa.
A gastrojejunostomy tube was also placed, and she received her second dose of intrathecal thiotepa on [**6-25**].
Gastrojejunostomy tube placement on [**5-21**] or 21 for inability to take food by mouth 6.
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg by mouth every 12 hours 2.
Metronidazole 500 mg three times a day by mouth 3.
Vancomycin 1 gram intravenously every 12 hours 4.
Zofran 2 mg twice a day intravenously as needed for nausea 6.
Mupirocin cream 2% twice a day to the gastrojejunostomy tube site 7.
Regular insulin sliding scale 9.
Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twice a day 11.
Lasix elixir 40 twice a day by mouth 12.
Ofloxacin ointment to the left eye 13.
Bacitracin/polymixin ointment to the right eye  LABORATORY DATA:  On transfer to O-Med, white blood cells 0.4, hemoglobin 10.1, hematocrit 30.1, platelets 356.
It was positive for nitrite, small leukocyte esterase, [**6-11**] white blood cells, [**11-21**] red blood cells.
This lesion is most commonly an effect of hemorrhage, in which case the low density suggests chronicity; however, a relation to the drainage catheter needs to be explored; Neurosurgical consultation is advised.
Neurology:  After transfer to O-Med, the Ommaya reservoir site began to slowly leak cerebrospinal fluid and Neurosurgery was reconsulted.
A Decadron taper was begun on [**7-2**] from a dose of 4 mg every 12 hours for a total of three weeks.
This should improve the wound healing around the previous Ommaya site, gastrojejunostomy tube site, and buttocks decubiti, as well as decrease blood sugar.
She is still on a regular insulin sliding scale for now.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Her hyponatremia was treated with intravenous fluid restriction (at most, 50 cc of normal saline when the tube feeds are not on) and salt tabs, as well as lasix elixir.
Cardiovascular:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was continued on metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day by mouth for her history of hypertension.
Thus ceftazidime and Flagyl intravenous was begun for a question of a possible aspiration pneumonia vs. hospital-acquired pneumonia.
Hematology/Oncology:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was begun on G-CSF for neutropenia and ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis.
The neutropenia resolved by [**6-28**], and the ciprofloxacin was discontinued at that point.
Heparin subcutaneously was used for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
Restaging MRIs of the head and spine as well as a bone scan are planned for either Monday, [**7-9**], or Tuesday, [**7-10**], in order to assess the direction of any further treatment in this patient.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient's gastrojejunostomy tube was declogged by Interventional Radiology on [**6-25**], and then again on [**7-2**], and then another time on [**7-7**].
The latter time it was changed to a gastrostomy tube of larger caliber and put to gravity for 24 hours.
Tube feeds will resume on the 8th.
She was tolerating tube feeds to a goal of 60 cc/hour.
Intravenous dilaudid seemed to work very well for her, according to the son.
We recently just began trying a lidocaine patch to her back.
She also received Tylenol every four hours and Vioxx as well, but this was recently discontinued, as the son thought it was not helping her.
Peripheral access:  The right arm had been used for peripheral intravenous lines, and a PICC line will probably be placed on [**7-9**] or 9 for her intravenous antibiotics and intravenous dilaudid.
The stoma nurse will be consulted to see the patient on [**7-9**] to care for the gastrojejunostomy tube site.
Infectious Disease:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] finished a ten day course of vancomycin for the methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus urinary tract infection, and subsequent urinalysis and cultures have revealed only [**Known lastname 23087**].
At first the Foley was changed and it was rechecked, however, it again showed [**Last Name (LF) 23087**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] fluconazole will be given by mouth once the gastrojejunostomy tube is resumed.
Intravenous ceftazidime and Flagyl was started on [**7-6**] for a question of an early left middle lobe or left lower lobe pneumonia.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  On [**7-9**], Mrs.[**Doctor Last Name 28099**] care was transferred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and a new O-Med team, and the rest of the hospital course and the discharge medications will be dictated as an addendum to this discharge summary by her.
