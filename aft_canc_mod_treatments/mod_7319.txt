#Sepsis: Patient initially treated empirically with Vancomycin and Zosyn, initially briefly requiring Levophed; likely source was thought to be abdominal abscess seen on CT abdomen however patient underwent IR guided drainage of the cyst and cultures were negative and the fluid collection was felt to NOT represent an abscess.
ID consulted and recommended continuing vanco/zosyn for a total of 14 days.
They felt the leukopenia and thrombocytopenia was secondary to  chemotherapy (most recent dose of Carboplatin/Gemcitabine was [**2135-7-14**], 3wks prior to admission) and sepsis - both causing supression of her bone marrow.
They feel she should receive a platelet transfusion is her platelets drop below 10,000 (should not happen since her PLTS are rising) or if she develops a significant bleed that cannot be cotrolled with conservative measures such as pressure.
#Urethelial Carcinoma: Pt w h/o aggressive malignancy s/p chemotherapy and right nephrouretectomy, with evidence of abdominal metastasis.
#H/O DVT: She was initially continued on treatment doses of lovenox for treatment of prior DVT.
However, LE dopplers were negative for DVT here and V/Q scan was low probability, so since she had received 6 months of treatment for her first episode of DVT (arguably known source - CA), she was changed to prohylactic dose of Lovenox.
Given her malignancy the risk-benefit of continuing prophylactic Lovenox indefinetely probably favors continuing it.
#Pain: Pt w abd chronic pain [**1-19**] malignancy and resections, on chronic narcotics as an outpatient.
Pain was exacerbated by IR drainage (see above), and pain was refratory to 5mg Oxycodone tabs, so pt was started on Morphine SR to improve basal control.
After her ICU stay and severe illness, she is very weak and deconditioned and will require [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation before returning home.

The source of the infection was not identified, but you improved with antibiotics and, per our infectious disease service, need to finish two full weeks of IV antibiotics.
You were also seen by our Oncology service and they feel that your blood counts are rising as expected after chemotherapy and the infection, including the platelet count which is rising more slowly.
You were found to not have any evidence of blood clots in your legs or your lungs so the dose of Lovenox was decreased to 30 mg per day in order to prevent further blood clots from forming.
