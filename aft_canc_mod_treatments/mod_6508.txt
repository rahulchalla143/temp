Liver was concerned about HRS so initiated treatment with midodrine and octreotide with albumin.
Given her Hct drop and abnormal labs as well as hypotension to the 60s requiring pressors she was admitted to the MICU for further work up.
In the MICU, she received 3 units prbcs, octreotide gtt, ctx for sbp ppx, and her Aspirin, Nadolol, Lasix, ACE, Spironolactone were held.
She was treated with albumin, midodrine, octreotide for presumed HRS as well.
The octreotide gtt was discontinued as banding was performed (4 cords of grade 3 varices with stigmata of recent bleeding, no overt bleeding; banded x 3).
On [**2-3**], a temporary HD access was placed and patient was placed on CVVH given volume overload and pressor dependence.
Of note, she required BiPAP for several days for respiratory distress given volume overload.
She was initiated on HD on [**2-8**] without complication.
Other studies showed significant cirrhotic stigmata (varices, splenomegaly, ascites), and her breathing improved with aggressive diuresis.

Since the previous tracing of [**2106-12-30**] the axis is more vertical and ST-T wave abnormalities may be more prominent.
[**2-2**] Renal U/S: 1.No evidence of obstruction.
In the absence of additional studies, given the pattern of findings, clinical treatment for pulmonary embolism would be warranted.
[**2-5**] LENIs: No evidence of DVT of in either lower extremity  [**2-10**] TUNNELED DIALYSIS LINE placement: Satisfactory placement of tunneled dual-lumen 23-cm tip-to-cuff dialysis catheter in the left internal jugular vein with fluoro and ultrasound guidance.
The temporary left IJ hemodialysis catheter was removed.
Impression: Ulcers in the esophagus Esophageal varices Erythema, congestion, abnormal vascularity and mosaic appearance in the whole stomach compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: Ulceration at site of previous band ligation, grade I varix proximal compressed with air.
Continue sucralfate 1 gram [**Hospital1 **] liquid, protonix.
She was noted to have a rising creatinine, an elevated (but not rising) troponin, a hematocrit below her baseline, hyperkalemia for which she received kayexalate.
She had an IJ placed, was started on pressors and admitted to the ICU for presumed GIB, started on octreotide, and had an upper endoscopy in the early morning of [**2-2**].
Three of her four known varices were banded, and she was started on a 5-day course of antibiotics.
She seemed to have an obstructive sleep apnea picture overnights, and on [**2-3**] she was put on BiPap overnight.
The hepatology team considered her potentially a hepatorenal syndrome case so she was treated with Midrodine, octreotide, albumin.
A temporary HD line was placed and CVVHD initiated.
However, given her freshly banded varices, after discussion with the GI service, it was decided she would be too high risk for anticoagulation given very high risk of rebleeding.
Her pressures stabilized off vasopressors and she was able to be initiated on hemodialysis on [**2-10**].
She continued to tolerated hemodialysis during the rest of her stay.
Her HRS treatment was discontinued as this was not felt to be the etiology of her renal failure (more likely ATN and pre-renal from hypotension in the setting of acute blood loss anemia from variceal bleed).
She was continued on midodrine as below.
This, in addition to her renal failure, are the likely etiology of her persistent anemia.
She is receiving epoeitin at dialysis.
She was started on daily iron supplementation.
Nadolol could be restarted if her blood pressures tolerate.
Initially she was not thought to be a candidate for liver transplantation because of her pulmonary hypertension, but she should have a repeat echo to reevaluate given her clinical improvement and reassess her candidacy for transplantation.
After her HRS treatment was discontinued, she was continued on Midodrine as her pressures did not allow her to tolerate hemodialysis.
Midodrine was changed to dialysis days only which the patient tolerated without difficulty.
# Pelvic mass: Found on prior admission.
# Diabetes type 2: Her metformin was discontinued given her renal failure and she was placed on a humalog insulin sliding scale.
# Renal failure:  Likely multifactorial: acute blood loss anemia causing hypotension with pre-renal and ATN features.
She is tolerating HD and has had negative dedicated CXR to rule out tuberculosis, a negative PPD as well as negative Hepatitis serologies.
She was not Hep B immune so she received her initial vaccine here on [**2107-2-18**].
