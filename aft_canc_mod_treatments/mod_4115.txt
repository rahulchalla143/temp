He saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4469**] on [**10-26**], who increased his Lasix from 20 [**Hospital1 **] to 40 [**Hospital1 **], but he only took one dose prior to presentation.

A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
CTA Chest: [**10-28**] CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are multiple mediastinal lymph nodes, some of which are pathologically enlarged, including a prevascular node measuring 12 mm in shortest diameter seen on series 3, image 39, previously 8 mm in diameter.
[**10-31**]: Persantine MIBI No perfusion defects noted; gated portion not completed due to AF.
[**10-31**]: Stress test TOTAL EXERCISE TIME:  4 % MAX HRT RATE ACHIEVED:  69 SYMPTOMS: NONE INTERPRETATION: 74 yo man (h/o AVR and CABG in [**2182**]) was referred for a CAD evaluation prior to surgery.
The patient was administered 0.142 mg/kg/min of persantine over 4 minutes.
The hemodynamic response to the persantine infusion was appropriate.
Median sternotomy wires midline and intact.
Cardiac prosthetic valve and coronary artery calcification noted.
[**11-11**] ccath: COMMENTS: 1) Resting hemodynamics on the ventilator revealed severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures with severe pulmonary hypertension and borderline low cardiac output on pressor support (neosynephrine) while tachycardic.
4) Successful PTCA and stenting was performed of the proximal CX lesion with a 3.0x15 mm Vision bare metal stent which was postdilated to 3.5 mm with a NC balloon.
(see PTCA comments) 5) Unsuccessful PTCA was performed of the proximal RCA with a 1.5 mm and 2.0 mm balloon due to suboptimal guide support from the anterior origin 80% proximal lesion essentially unchanged, no dissection, and normal flow.
Further intervention was not attempted as the vessel was small, nondominant and did not appear to be the culpril lesion.
Successful stenting of the proximal CX with a bare metal stent.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus on pulmonary angiogram.
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The aortic prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 74 year-old male with CAD status post 2-vessel CABG, s/p porcine AVR, chronic AF off anticoagulation, ischemic cardiomyopathy and persistent left fibrothorax s/p R decortication who presented with increasing DOE and oxygen requirement.
During his hospitalization, the patient was diuresed and then underwent a decortication of his L lung.
The patient was then started on ASA and plavix and extubated the day after his cath.
Two chest tubes an a JP drain were placed.
Following this procedure, his 02 requirement was 2L NC from 3L NC with improvement in lung sounds.
His creatinine and potassium were monitored closely given aggressive diuresis, and were stable during his hospital course.
The patient underwent decortication of the left fibrothorax with thoracic surgery on [**11-4**].
He eventually underwent evacuation of his L hemothorax on [**11-18**].
Two chest tubes and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] drain were placed for continued drainage.
He was initially diuresed with PRN IV lasix doses, then transitioned to qd PO lasix 80mg three days prior to discharge, and to 80mg PO bid the day of discharge.
This regimen will have to followed at rehab with alterations as needed for maximal fluid balance, given pt was on an increased dose prior to admit.
His lisinopril was increased to 5mg po qd, carvedilol was discontinued per their recommendations and diltiazem was started for rate control.
His PA HTN appeared to be longstanding as evidenced on prior echos and was likely related to chronic lung compromise secondary to hemothorax and fibrothorax.
The patient was transiently on Dopa post cath for his BiV failure but this was successfully weaned off.
He was maintained on ACEI and metoprolol for their cardioprotective effects.
DDX for the hypotension also included adrenal insufficiency given his h/o prednisone use.
Therefore, the patient was started on stress dose steroids x 5 days.
He was then transitioned to PO prednisone (last dose 11/19).
He was rate controlled, with HR in 70s-80s, with diltiazem titration as blood pressure tolerated.
In the CCU the patient was rate controlled with digoxin and metoprolol.
Given the patient's h/o bleeding (GIB and hemothorax) he was not started on heparin or coumadin.
The digoxin was eventually weaned off as his EF 45-50%.
He was discharged on metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **].
Left sided fibrothorax and pleural effusion:  The patient underwent a L sided decortication on [**11-4**] with subsequent development of a L hemothorax.
His L hemothorax was evacuated on [**11-8**] with placement of two chest tubes and a JP drain.
Surgery was following the patient and pulled all drains prior to discharge.
The patient's low Hct was in the setting of multiple procedures and s/p L hemothorax.
MDS is a also on the differential.
He also had been on prednisone for his TCP with little effect.
During this hospitalization, the patient was transfused on one occasion and received FFP prior to his operations.
Patient recommended to have a repeat hematocrit check 3 days after discharge to assess need for additional transfusions.
He was given Vit K to keep his INR<1.4.
