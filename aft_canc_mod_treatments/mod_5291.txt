She received 1U PRBC intraoperatively.
All cultures including blood, line, sputum, and urine had no growth.
WBC declined with management of SBO.
3) CV:  Shock postoperatively initially thought to be septic, but on reevaluation of vitals, hypovolemia was more likely.
She required pressors until POD#1 then maintained BP without medications.
Metoprolol and Digoxin were restarted in ICU for maintenance of rate control.
Anticoagulation was initiated in ICU with heparin gtt and coumadin.
Heparin gtt was held given concerns for bleeding but coumadin was continued.
4) Miscellaneous:  Outpatient medications were restarted including lipitor, levoxyl, pentasa (for Chrohn's disease).
An insulin gtt was initiated in the acute period in the ICU and transitioned to regular ISS.
Heparin gtt restarted POD#4 and again discontinued POD#5 after clinical bleeding per vagina and JP drains.
Coumadin was continued without loading doses.
She was maintained on asa and coumadin for anticoagulation with plan to d/c asa when INR [**2-16**].
Her INR plateaued at 1.5 but Coumadin was not increased due to concern for high risk of bleed.
She will likely need coumadin dose increased to achieve therapeutic INR.
3) Respiratory: Pt required O2 via NC to maintain O2 sats until POD 6.
She required several doses of IV lasix for fluid overload.
She was transferred to gen [**Doctor First Name **] for further management.
She responded well to lasix and IVF boluses.
Gen [**Doctor First Name **] (from POD 9):  CT showed SBO - patient was made NPO, NGT & foley placed for decompression, IVFs and TPN started, patient monitored with serial exams.
High output still from NGT, increasing drainage and erythema.
Because of persistent obsturction and no improvement, patient was taken to the OR on POD 15 for exploratory laparotomy, resitting of ileosotmy, lysis of adhesions, resection of small intestine, closure of enterotomys x2 and closure of abdomen with vicryl mesh and VAC.
Vancomycin added to levo/flagyl for GPC in wound.
POD22 - mesh was removed and new suction drainage system was employed to drain the wound.
POD25 - all antibiotics were dc'd; latest urince culture was contamination, no growth.
Medications on Admission: Metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **] Meclizine 25 qd Pentasa 1000 mg QID Levoxyl 50 qd Digoxin 0.
