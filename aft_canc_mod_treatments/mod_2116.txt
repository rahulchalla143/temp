IMPRESSION: Penetration and aspiration of thin liquids.
Pt recently had a long hospitalization course for osteomyeltitis complicated by multifactorial respiratory failure s/p trach/peg, renal failure on HD now, new diagnosis of CML now on gleevac, and persistent AMS of unclear etiology.
#Fevers: Started on broad antibiotic coverage with linezolid , bactrim and meropenem to cover osteomyelitis of right foot, stenotrophomonas pna (from prior sputum cultures as well as repeat sputum culture from this admission), and UTI (rehab center reports pus in urine).
Patient's symptoms improved, afebrile, more lucid, less secretions, and antibiotics were switched to Daptomycin and Meropenem, per ID reccomendations.
Patient will be on dapto/[**Last Name (un) 2830**] for 6 weeks (start date [**2177-7-8**]) followed by PO antibiotics for osteomyelitis suppression.
Was initially on linezolid and meropenem for coverage and then switched to Daptomycin and Meropenem (start date: [**2177-7-8**]).
Pt found to have coccygeal ulcers and was followed by wound care with daily dressing changes.
He was given hydrea and gleevac on last admission.
Pt will continue current gleevac regimen for CML suppression until he decides to focus on comfort measures only.
# Hydrocephalus: Unclear etiology but patient has h/o spinal surgeries for meningioma in [**10-7**].
He initially had a dopoff tube in place for meds and tube feeds which was discontinued after long discussion with patient about deciding to eat food despite aspiration risks.
Patient aware of his very poor prognosis and elected to eat food that he desires, despite the risks.
Pt was given dilaudid every 2 hrs and gabapentin for pain control.
He was also written for IV dilaudid 0.75mg as needed for pain if he can not take PO.
He still had pain on this regimen but preferred to be alert.
He was on 3.5L O2 and given neb treatments all through his trach.
Sputum culture grew stenotrophomonas- sparse growth, and patient was briefly treated with bactrim.
New foley was placed to drain old [**Year (4 digits) **] in bladder.
All medications were renally dosed.
He does not need further ultrafiltration at this point unless his clinical status changes.
On HD days, he will get these meds after HD.
At times he required neutrophos supplements for low phos.
# Coagulopathy: Pt found to have elevated INR and coumadin for A. fib was held.
Coumadin was held initially for an elevated INR and was then discontinued because pt has poor prognosis and end stage disease and history of GI bleeds on coumadin.
Case management/social work/palliative care were all active in helping patient and family coordinate care and goals.
It was decided that patient wanted to be transfered to [**Hospital **] Hospital (In [**Location (un) **], ultimately) close to home so he could see his mother and son and then become comfort measures only.
He requested to stop HD at that point and to have pain control for comfort.
After he sees his mother and son, he has made it clear that he would like to focus on comfort measures.
While inpatient, he decided that he did not want tube feeds anymore and was willing to take the risks so he can eat food that he enjoys.
He eats food in small bites with one-to-one assistance and sitting upright.
In terms of pain, he will be going to rehab on dilaudid 4-6mg every 2 hrs for pain.
At this point, he would like to keep this pain regimen so he can be alert for his family.
He will continue his gleevac, meropenem, daptomycin, hemodialysis, wound care until he sees his mother and son.
After that, he would like to stop hemodialysis and focus on pain control and comfort.
