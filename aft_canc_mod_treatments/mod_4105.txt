She also states that the respiratory therapy at Rehab noted increasing secretions and thickening of secretions over the last 2-3 days.
She states that her father's O2 sats were dropping into 60's for [**2-28**] minute intervals today as well.
Patient was started on Ertrapenem and doxycycline.
Patient was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management.

The osseous structures demonstrate bifrontal and parietal prior craniotomies.
Brief Hospital Course: Hospital Course: Initially he finished 2 weeks course of Meropenem/Ampicillin for VRE and bacteremia and ESBL Klebsiella PNA.
Dilantin was then started for seizure ppx.
Stool was + for C.diff and Flagyl was started.
He was treated with 2 week course of Vanc/meropenem and remained clinically stable.
He was off the antibiotics for several days.
He was clinically stable until [**4-5**] when he had another episode of fever and hypotension, so Vanc/meropenem were re-started and IVF given to maintain his BP.
Patient started on vanc/meropenem initially which was switched to meropenem once urinary source revealed.
Patient needs imipenem or meropenam given history of pseudomonas.
Patient has had chronic foley requirement.
Plan is to keep foley in place given significant clots/bleeding and difficulty in re-placing a new catheter and to minimize patient's suffering.
Again trasferred to Unit [**2-18**] for hypotension which responded to fluids and transfusion.
Finished course of meropenem for ESBL Klebsiella on [**2126-3-2**].
It was thought to be secondary to hypovolemia, however also considered cardiogenic shock, sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency.
BP responded to NS boluses and 2 Units of PRBC's.
Hypotension resolved but did require periodic NS boluses over [**Date range (1) 15001**] weekend again.
On [**3-20**] became hypotensive to 40/P and was febrile with temp of 103, so cx'd again x 2 with mycolytics and given 4 L NS and total of 2 u. PRBC overnight.
Patient finished a 14 day course of meropenem and Vancomycin.
Flagyl for two weeks beyond meropenem course for history of c. diff.
Ulcers: A) Left heel--no osteo on plain film, podiatry could not probe to bone, cont W-->D dressings.
B) knee--seen by plastics, chemical debridement and wet-to-dry dressings with duoderm dressing changed daily; daily wet-to-dry dressings, no pressure on knee.
Started metronidazole 500 mg tid on [**2126-3-13**] for total 14-day course; but has been repeatedly on and off antibiotics so will need to extend for 14 days after other abx finished.
However, given his overall poor prognosis, decision was made to not pursue any diagnostic/therapeutic intervention.
Sucralfate discontinued and Prevacid was started instead.
Dilantin was started for seizure prophylaxis.
MS did not return to previous baseline after treatment of multiple infections and resolution of subclinical seizures.
Dilantin level initially therapeutic until increase in tube feedings.
Seizure/dilantin: Adjusted dose [**2126-2-28**] (after corrected dilantin level of 6.1) to dilantin 150mg [**Hospital1 **] and qhs.
Repeat dilantin, albumin labs on [**2126-3-2**] showed corrected dilantin ~7 and so dosing changed on [**2126-3-3**] to 200 [**Hospital1 **] and 150 qhs.
Once corrected dilantin level <20, restarted dosing at 200 mg qAM, 150 mg qPM, and 150 mg qhs.
Levels checked ~[**3-21**] and dilantin level was high once corrected for albumin but this level was in the context of tube feedings being held, so will re-check.
Throughout [**Month (only) 958**] continued to re-check dilantin and adjust as needed.
Re-check of dilantin and albumin scheduled for [**2126-4-29**].
10.Trach care: aggressive suctioning and chest PT, maintain sats >93%.
Px: PPI, (unable to tolerate pneumoboots secondary to skin breakdown), has IVC filter, continue zinc and vit c, collagenase for ulcers.
For example, maintenance of foley catheter is needed for history of urethral clots/bleeding but optimally it would be changed with current UTI.
To minimize patient's suffering, however, will maintain this foley and treat through the infection.
Similar rationale behind keeping mid-line at this time, not more aggressively working up adenocarcinoma etc.
