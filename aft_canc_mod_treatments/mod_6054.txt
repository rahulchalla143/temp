CAT scan reveals a large right retroperitoneal tumor involving the inferior vena cava associated with a right hydronephrosis.
Status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
Status post open cholecystectomy.
MEDS AT HOME:  Include Tylenol #3.
After consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room for an elective resection of the retroperitoneal spindle cell tumor by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who was assisted in this case by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3407**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
During this procedure, the patient had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed to monitor her hemodynamics intraoperatively and also postoperatively.
In short, there was 1) a radical resection of the retroperitoneal sarcoma, 2) a radical resection of the right kidney and ureter, 3) pelvic and retroperitoneal lymph node resection, 4) ligation and resection of the infrarenal inferior vena cava, and 5) intraoperative radiation therapy administered to the retroperitoneal tumor bed.
Finally, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was placed in the tumor bed.
In the ICU, the patient was gradually weaned from her ventilator.
In addition, she was resuscitated with intravenous fluids because of her hypovolemic state, and she was transfused with red blood cells multiple times.
Her pain, at first, was controlled with propofol which kept her sedated, and then subsequently after she was extubated, she was maintained on a morphine PCA device.
In addition, once she became lucid, she was slowly advanced on a PO diet, and by the time she was transferred to the floor on [**7-21**], postop day #4, she was tolerating a clear liquid diet without nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain.
Once on the floor, the patient was given PO pain medications.
Her central venous line was discontinued, as was her Foley catheter.
We continued to diurese her with intravenous lasix doses and then subsequently PO lasix doses.
She was evaluated by physical therapy who concluded that she could safely go home with continued rehabilitation treatment.
