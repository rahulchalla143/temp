Brief Hospital Course: 67 year old female with metastatic colon cancer s/p 5-FU/Leucovorin who presented with fever, hypotension and blood per enterocutaneous fistula found to have E. coli bacteremia thought secondary to her fistula, s/p 14 day course for ceftriaxone.
She was started on pressors but was quickly weaned off of this within 24 hours.
The antibiogram indicated that it was Zosyn, CTX-sensitive, and FQ/Bactrim resistant.
She was initially started on Zosyn on admission to the ICU and switched to CTX after sensitivities were available.
She was initially started on Zosyn but this was stopped upon speciation and she was switched to cefepime as her Enterobacter was resistent to Zosyn.
Her port was also discontinued and her PICC line was resited.
She was started on vancomycin given her extensive hospital course.
Her urine sediment was bland for casts and UA was remarkable for yeast only.
She required intermittent transfusions due to slow bleeding from her fistual.
She also later had an unprovoked episode  Bleeding was controlled with silver nitrate and Surgi-seal.
Topical thrombin was the next step if these interventions did not cease bleeding.
Power PICC placed for a CT Torso to be performed with desensitization protocol.
Further management will be deferred to outpatient oncology but she may be a candidate for panitumimab as an outpatient.
She was continued on opium tincture and loperamide.
# H/O PE/SVC syndrome/port-related clots: Fondaparinaux initially held due to recent fistula bleeding.
Continued topical therapies and local care.
These episodes were controlled with Silver Nitrate, surgi-seal, and thrombin gel as needed.
Prednisone was given prior to CT as patient is allergic to the dye.
# Access: Patient had a port in place as well as PICC on right on admission.
Due to recurrent bacteremia, her port was pulled and her PICC line was resited.
# Nutrition: TPN initially held while hypotensive in ICU.
# Rash: She had yeast in her urine culture and was started on fluconazole.
Despite extensive discussion to patient about her poor prognosis, she would like to continue cancer treatment and remain full code.
