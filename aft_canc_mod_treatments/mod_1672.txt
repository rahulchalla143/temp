An enlarged portacaval node measures 1.8 x 1.3 cm (2:26).
Note is made of a left total hip arthroplasty.
In this case, a Hodgkin lymphoma is favored for the following reasons: 1) Co-expression of CD30, [**Male First Name (un) **].2, [**9-28**] and PAX5 with evidence of EBV-infection (LMP+) is more likely to be associated with Hodgkin Lymphoma.
3) The subsequent biopsy of the patient's bone marrow (S12-31075H) revealed patchy infiltration by a lymphoma containing classic [**Doctor Last Name **]-Sternberg cells and an appropriate immunoreactive background.

He was started on vanc/zosyn/doxycycline for empiric coverage.
Sarcoidosis was also considered possible.
ID and Heme/Onc were consulted, and they recommended that empiric antibiotic therapy be discontinued given that liver biopsy was consistent with malignant process.
Heme/Onc began allopurinol for uric acid production prophylaxis and dexamethasone was started with daily surveillance of tumor lysis labs.
Potassium increased significantly after initiation of steroids, without any EKG findings (no prolonged PR interval, peaked T waves, or widened QRS) at K of 5.6 and 7.3.
Improved when fever was treated and volume was repleted.
Both percutaneous biopsy of the liver and BM biopsies were obtained, which revealed lymphoma with characteristics intermediate between large B cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma.
Due to his liver enzymes being elevated he was first started on dexamethasone for treatment of the lymphoma.
After several days his LFT's and bili began to trend down such that chemotherapy could be started.
BEACOPP was initated on [**2173-7-16**], holding adriamycin and procarbazine due to persistently elevated LFTs.
Pt received reduced dosage chemotherapy and on [**2173-7-18**] Tbili was down to 2.6 so  procarbazine and adriamycin were added at a reduced dosage.
Pt tolerated chemotherapy regimen well and will be discharged on procarbazine and prednisone to continue the BEACOPP regimen with the plan for him to get Day 8 Bleomycin and vincristine as an outpatient.
Pupils remain reactive to light and accommadation and EOMI.
He was started empirically on vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and doxycycline.
After liver and BM biopsy confirmed lymphoma, he was stopped on all antibiotics, and started on allopurinol for ppx against elevated uric acid, and 40mg IV dexamethasone QD with [**Hospital1 **] tumor lysis labs.
Pt did not require transfusion suppport during in house chemotherapy.
Pt had received tylenol prn for fever, limit to 2g daily in light of liver dysfunction.
Pt will be discharged with 4 days of steroids and then tapered.
No need for insulin at home given only mild elevation of glucose on steroids.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # Depression - on citalopram at home.
He was initially started on Paxil, but transitioned to citalopram, s/p confirmation of medications with pharmacy.
Pt was instructed to not take citalopram while undergoing chemotherapy.
TRANSITION ISSUES: #Pt will need to get Day #8 chemo (vincristine and bleomycin on [**2173-7-23**]).
Pt was instructed not to take neupogen until instructed by his oncologist.

You were given steroids after which your liver function improved.
You were then started on chemotherapy for the hodgkins lymphoma which you tolerated very well.
The chemotherapy you received was reduced dosage since your liver function was still decreased.
