Admission Date:  [**2146-12-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-12-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2082-6-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Morphine / Amoxicillin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**] Chief Complaint: increased air hunger   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Video Assisted thoracoscopy with wedge resection from left lung  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 64-year-old female who is transferred to the MICU following intubation yesterday for decreased oxygen saturations on Post op day 3 for VATS and wedge resection.
She then completed a course of levofloxacin but about a month later, she continued to have shortness of breath and cough.
Frozen section unfortunately disclosed what appeared to be an infiltrative poorly differentiated carcinoma with evidence of lymphangitic tumor involvement and the tumor emboli in the vessels.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was then sent out to the floor where she developed progressive hypoxemia despite nebulizers, diuresis and nonrebreather.
She was transferred to CSRU on POD 3 and intubated for O2 sat 82% on NRB.
She was also diuresed and started on cefepime and flagyl for presumed aspiration PNA.
Motor vehicle accident with ankle surgery bilaterally.
Dilation and curretage in [**2115**].
ABG 7.36/35/81 TELE: bigeminy GEN: Intubated and sedated HEENT:  Anicteric sclerae, normal conjunctivae.
OG tube in place.
CHEST: left chest with surgical dressings with minimal serosanguinous drainage HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
ET tube, nasogastric tube, and left subclavian line are in standard placements respectively.
Increased tracer activity noted within the left hip and both ankles, consistent with the patient's history of prior trauma and surgery within these regions.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old female with new finding of renal mass and lung nodules, who was admitted for shortness of breath, found to have pulmonary emboli, and who required intubation post VATS for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
On transfer to the MICU service we treated her with aggressive fluid hydration for decreased urine output, keeping her CVP in the 20's, given her preload dependance due to right heart failure.
We eventually started her on a dobutamine drip to increase cardiac output and urine output.
We kept her anticoagulated with coumdain given her PE.
Now on AC at FiO2 50% and PEEP 8 with some continued hypoxemia.
- continue current vent settings as her hypoxemia will not be resolved as the cancer is irreversible.
- await path from VATS - discuss palliative therapies with family vs. comfort measures only .
She's therapeutic on coumadin and follow up CTA did not reveal progression of PEs.
- continue coumadin for now .
Could be secondary to post op inflammation but more likely infectious as CT scan showed and new LLL opacity.
- discontinue cefepime as patient has h/o amox allergy - start levoflox and continue flagyl for 7 day course (day 1 = [**12-19**]) .
# diabetes: on metformin and avandia at home - SSI for now with QID FS .
Here was briefly hypotensive, likely secondary to propofol - discontinue current agents for now as she's normotensive but recently on pressors.
# hypothyroidism: on levoxyl at home - continue levoyxl .
# FEN: start Tube feeds as extubation date is not yet clear.
Will check albumin and get nutrition consult.
- follow lytes and replete Metabolic Acidosis/Acidemic pH: stable Etiology: Non Gap (hyperchloremic) metabolic acidosis secondary to fluid rescusitation (high Chloride load), renal failure (given poor urine output) - follow up chemistries and blood gases, continue LR prn for resucitation for more appropriate buffer .
# prophylaxis: on coumadin, bowel regimen, PPI .
all meds except versed and fentanyl d/c'd.
Medications on Admission: metformin 500 QD levoxyl 0.125 QD hctz 25 QD avandia 4 QD norvasc 5 QD nortriptyline 25 QD benicar hct 20/12.5 QD .
