For his hypertension, he was started on a labetolol drip.
Then he was transitioned to PO medications.
An ACE inhibitor was added and titrated up to reach a goal SBP 100-110.
His  labetalol was titrated up and the drip was weaned as his PO meds took effect.
He responded well to sub-lingual nitroglycerin and quickly became chest pain free.
Diltiazem was pushed since it was thought that pushing metoprolol would not be effective as the beta receptors were already occupied by the labetolol.
