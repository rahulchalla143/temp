You had a rigid bronchoscopy (procedure to look in your lungs) with cryptherapy and electrocautery to help open your airways and improve your breathing.
After the procedure you had shortness of breath and likely had a blockage of your airway from a mucous plug or blood clot.
You were admitted to the ICU for non-invasive ventilation (breathing mask) and respiratory monitoring.
You also received steroids after the procedure, which were subsequently stopped.
The Interventional Pulmonology team was very involved in your care, and felt that your breathing was greatly improved and you were safe for discharge, with follow-up in clinic in one month with a CT scan of your airways.
