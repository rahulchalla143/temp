Her course was complicated by worsening respiratory distress following bronchoscopy and platelet transfusion, with likely transfusion reaction.
Her blood cultures from admission had one set positive for strep viridans and her urine culture was growing Klebsiella > 100K(pansensitive except for nitrofurantoin).
All blood and urine cultures since starting antibiotics were negative.
She was treated with a oxygen by NRB and albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.
In addition, she developed respiratory distress following platelet transfusion consistent with acute tranfsuion reaction and was transferred to the intensive care unit.
Her respiratory status slowly improved over the next several day with diuresis and she returned to the floor and remained stable from a respiratory standpoint throughout the rest of her hospitalization.
She was discharged to a nursing facility to complete a 14 day course of cefepime, azithromycin, and vancomycin given neutropenia, last day of antibiotics should be [**3-28**].
2)Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria: Eculizumab held throughout admission and on discharge in light of fevers.
She became progressively pancytopenic during her admission most likely due to acute illness vs. MDS transformation of her bone marrow.
She was transfused a total of 4 units of PRBC to maintain a hematocrit >18 and 2 units of platelets for platelet count <10.
After extensive conversation with Mrs. [**Known lastname **] she decided that she no longer wished to have transfusions given that she most likely would be transfusion dependent.
She understood and accepted the risks of not being transfused PRBC and Platelets and opted to no longer have routine lab draws.
She was continued on danazol, folic acid and cyanocobalamin on discharge.
She should not have routine blood work at her nursing facility.
She was continued on her outpatient regimen of norvasc and lasix.
Her morning dose was continued at 10 units.
She may require up titration of her evening insulin dose as she recovers from her acute illness and her appetite improves.
She was also treated with humalog sliding scale.

Discharge Condition: fair HCT on discharge 17.8, patient does not want further transfusions, is aware of risks satting 100% on 3L NC at rest legally blind petechial rash on buttocks   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with fevers, shortness of breath, and low oxygen saturations that were thought to be caused by a viral infection versus a pneumonia.
You were also put on several antibiotics to cover for bacteria in the blood as well as a urinary tract infection.
During the admission your blood counts were also found to be low, likely due to a combination of your infection and due to progression of your PNH and possible effect on your bone marrow.
You were treated with high flow oxygen and steroids and you slowly improved.
Please continue to take all of your medications as prescribed.
