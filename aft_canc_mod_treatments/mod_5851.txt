HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 54 year old gentleman with multiple medical problems including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, prosthetic mitral valve placement.
The patient was status post mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valve replacement, pericardial stripping on [**2123-8-10**].
He had a prolonged postoperative course complicated by failure to wean from ventilator with tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement and Methicillin resistant  The patient was transferred to the rehabilitation center on [**2123-9-6**].
The patient had his right chest tube discontinued today on the day of admission.
He was noted to be in pulmonary edema on examination and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for evaluation and treatment of his pulmonary edema and possible transfusion for low hematocrit.
He also was given Lasix 60 mg times one with good urine output 500 cc in the first two hours and 750 cc total.

Total bilirubin 0.85, LDH 229, transferrin low 2.02, folate 43.7, haptoglobin 81, TIBC 45, iron 4.0, reticulocyte count 3.0% on [**2123-9-17**].
Catheterization [**2123-4-6**], revealed ejection fraction of 35%, global left ventricular hypokinesis, 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation, right coronary artery normal, obtuse marginal normal, left anterior descending normal, circumflex 90% stenosis proximally, patch pericardiac calcifications, right atrium 22/24/19, right ventricle 38/19, left ventricle 108/19, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 20/20/18, cardiac output 3.1, cardiac index 1.7.
IMPRESSION:  This is a 54 year old man with multiple medical problems including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, prosthetic mitral valve and tricuspid valve, who has been on a trach mask since discharge on [**2123-9-6**].
He presents on [**2123-9-20**], with increased shortness of breath and pulmonary edema in the context of having a chest tube pulled that day.
His outpatient regimen is Captopril 6.25 mg t.i.d., Lasix 60 mg q.d., Amiodarone 400 mg q.d., with p.r.n.
Digoxin as well as Aldactone was added to his regimen.
The patient was placed on Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d., Aldactone 25 mg and Lasix 70 mg p.o.
It was thought to increase his Lasix dose and to change his Captopril to Mavik 2 mg.
He was continued on this regimen of medications until [**2123-9-28**], with systolic blood pressure of 60 to 80s.
His Mavik was discontinued secondary to this low blood pressure.
His Digoxin was also discontinued secondary to increased Digoxin level.
His blood pressure was difficult to maintain because there was a 20 point systolic blood pressure difference between his right and left arm, his right being 20 points greater than the left arm, but unable to use right upper extremity for blood pressure measurements because his PICC line was in place.
He was started on Dopamine.
Central venous pressure line was placed and was unable to go across the tricuspid valve replacement with a central venous pressure of 12, cardiac output of 7.1 and SVR of 700.
The etiology of his shock was felt to be vasodilatory, sepsis versus myxedema versus adrenal suppression and the patient was started on Neo-Synephrine.
His Neo-Synephrine was maintained for five days and weaned to off on [**2123-10-3**], with systolic blood pressure in the 120s.
He was started on Captopril and titrated to 25 mg p.o.
The patient on [**2123-10-5**], was on Captopril 25 mg t.i.d., Digoxin 0.0625 mg q.d.
His Neo-Synephrine was weaned off.
The patient was placed on Zosyn for his sepsis.
The patient was eventually placed on a Lasix drip with a fluid goal of negative one liter.
His Captopril was increased to 37.5 mg t.i.d.
Digoxin was restarted.
Lasix drip was titrated for adequate urine output.
On [**2123-10-10**], his Lasix drip was stopped secondary to a bump in his blood urea nitrogen and creatinine up to 115 and 1.7.
On that same day, his Captopril was changed to Zestril 10 mg q.d.
for better blood pressure control without the episodes of hypotension.
On [**2123-10-11**], his right femoral arterial line was taken out and his blood pressure was being able to be monitored on his right arm despite his PICC line.
On [**2123-10-12**], the patient was felt to be dry especially since he was not receiving any tube feeds because of possible procedure that day.
He was continued on Aspirin throughout his hospitalization stay.
Stenosis was in his left circumflex at 90% stenosis.
He has an ICD in place and Amiodarone started in [**2123-4-1**].
Dual chamber pacer - His Amiodarone was continued at the dose of 400 mg q.d., paced to 80 beats per minute.
The patient was subtherapeutic on admission, was given Lovenox on the day of admission, but was started on Heparin drip while he was in the hospital until his therapeutic INR was reached.
The patient's Heparin drip was stopped for several days in the beginning of [**Month (only) **] because of a large left groin and thigh hematoma which developed.
It was restarted but then stopped again briefly because of bright red blood from his trachea, however, this stabilized and by discharge, he was back on the Heparin drip for several days.
He has been on tracheal mask at 40% FIO2.
Additionally, right chest tube was removed on [**2123-9-20**], no pneumothorax seen on chest x-ray.
He continued to require frequent suctioning and sputum was sent for culture.
Because of his history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, he was began on Levaquin, Flagyl and Vancomycin.
In the first few days of hospitalization, bronchoscopy was done showing dried blood, no active bleeding which was consistent with suction trauma.
Once he was identified with Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, his Levaquin and Flagyl were discontinued.
It was decided to continue his Vancomycin for a total of 28 day course.
He stayed intubated for five days and transitioned to a trach mask on [**2123-10-2**].
On [**2123-10-3**], the patient was noted to have a hernia/bulge on the left chest wall at the chest tube site approximately five centimeters in size.
The patient's Vancomycin was held on [**2123-10-4**], for a high level of 42.3.
His Vancomycin trough continued to be high and so it was continued to be held.
There is moderate left sided effusion and they recommend a thoracentesis but no treatment for the bulge.
The patient failed a trial with trach  valve on [**2123-10-9**], and it was decided to replace his tracheostomy to a #6 from a #8.
The patient did experience two days of bright red blood from  his tracheostomy tube and interventional pulmonology was following him.
They did do a scope and found some superficial bleeding vessels and were planning to cauterize it but then the bleeding stopped on its own and it was decided to hold off on cauterization and scoping.
The patient failed the trach valve again on [**2123-10-11**], and the plan was for interventional pulmonology to scope to look for an obstruction causing this failure with the valve, however, on [**2123-10-12**], a new tracheostomy was placed, this time size #4, and on [**2123-10-13**], the  trach valve was retried with success, having the patient talk without it popping off.
Therefore, the scope of his trachea was held off.
CT surgery was called to take a look at it and they decided that there was nothing to be concerned about, that there was pleural fluid in that bulge and could be treated conservatively and left alone.
Renal - The patient's blood urea nitrogen and creatinine on admission appeared to be at his baseline, however, he was also felt to be intravascularly dry with a high ratio of blood urea nitrogen/creatinine on [**2123-9-24**], with third spacing of his fluids so there was an increase in his blood urea nitrogen and creatinine over the next three to four days with decreased urine output not responding to Lasix.
He was started on Dopamine which was changed to Neo-Synephrine with increased urine output of greater than 150 cc/hour for two days.
Urine output started to decrease so he was transitioned to Lasix boluses which was then changed to Lasix drip with continued good urine output.
On [**2123-10-5**], he had a slight decrease in urine output and it was decided to transfuse the patient with two units of packed red blood cells to help mobilize his fluids.
It was decided if it rose any further, Acetazolamide would be started for better diuresis, however, it did not go over 40 and actually decreased to approximately low 30s and Acetazolamide was never started.
On [**2123-10-10**], since the patient was felt to be dry, his goal fluid balance was changed to positive/neutral and the Lasix drip was discontinued.
His Lasix drip was also discontinued because of an increase in his blood urea nitrogen and creatinine.
Even after the Lasix drip was discontinued, the patient's blood urea nitrogen and creatinine continued to be elevated with blood urea nitrogen of 100 and creatinine 1.6 on discharge.
On [**2123-10-12**], the patient was given fluid boluses of 250 cc times three, total of 750 cc for low urine output and a dry state.
He had continuous serosanguinous drainage from his chest tube sites.
He was continued on iron and on admission was transfused two units of packed red blood cells with Lasix.
Anticoagulation wise, he was placed on a Heparin drip.
After receiving the two units of packed red blood cells, he stayed at 30.0.
The patient's hematocrit fluctuated between 26.0 and 30.0 and he received two units of packed red blood cells on [**2123-9-29**].
Since [**2123-9-28**], and [**2123-10-6**], the patient received a total of six units of packed red blood cells for hematocrit between 24.0 and 30.0.
On [**2123-10-3**], he received two units of packed red blood cells with increased hematocrit to 27.0 which decreased to 24.0 two days later.
He was given then two more units of packed red blood cells.
Throughout the decreased hematocrit values, the patient was maintained on Heparin drip for his St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] artificial valve.
He was on Coumadin but was switched to Heparin for better control.
It was planned to check his percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy lavage.
His noon hematocrit on [**2123-10-6**], was 30.7 so it was decided not to lavage his percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy fluid and he was not transfused.
On [**2123-10-6**], it was decided to stop his Heparin drip for the decreased hematocrit but then on [**2123-10-7**], it was decided to restart it at 1000 units per sliding scale with goal partial thromboplastin time of 50 to 60.
His Heparin drip was turned off.
Vascular surgery team believed that no surgical or interventional radiology intervention was appropriate at this time.
Haptoglobin was low and direct bilirubin was normal.
On [**2123-10-8**], his Heparin drip was restarted at 7:00 p.m. with the approval of the interventional pulmonology team.
On [**2123-10-10**], the patient was transfused one unit of blood for hematocrit of 26.9.
His tracheostomy stopped bleeding after a couple days.
His Heparin drip was restarted on [**2123-10-8**].
It was decided to give him a dose of Lovenox 60 mg on the day of discharge and to stop the Heparin drip three hours later.
Coumadin was given the afternoon of discharge as well 5 mg with a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.5 for valvular protection.
The patient completed Vancomycin for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia on [**2123-9-2**].
The patient was started on Vancomycin for a total of 28 days.
For Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, Vancomycin was being dosed p.r.n.
In the setting of an increased cardiac output and decreased SVR to the 200 to 600s, he was felt to have sepsis and he was covered with Zosyn for seven days to cover pseudomonas.
On [**2123-10-11**], the patient was given one gram intravenously times one of Vancomycin after it had been held for several days for high trough level.
By suggestion of the endocrine team which was consulted, it was thought to be secondary to Amiodarone although he was not thought to be in myxedema coma.
He was given a stress dose of steroids and drew random cortisol level which was 23.
It was felt an adequate response per endocrine and no more steroids were given.
Gastrointestinal - The patient had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube in on admission.
He was continued on tube feeds and Zantac for prophylaxis.
The patient was on Prevacid through his tube feeds.
Nutrition was poor with low albumin of 1.7 and he was started on tube feeds.
Nutrition was consulted and he was placed on Impact with fiber tube feeds.
The patient was not placed on intravenous fluids given his total body fluid overload and third spacing.
In the setting of diuresis, the patient was repleted his magnesium and potassium.
On [**2123-9-30**], he was noted to have undigested tube feeds in the setting of Fentanyl drip for sedation.
On [**2123-10-13**], the patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells for intravascular volume repletion.
Neuropsychiatry - During his hypotensive episodes, the patient was placed on Fentanyl drip for sedation but was weaned off the next day.
She felt he was not depressed but more frustrated with not being able to eat and his having to have a tracheostomy in.
He was on the Heparin drip on and off.
He was on Prevacid for gastrointestinal prophylaxis and multipedis splints.
Lines - The patient had a right PICC placed, right femoral artery, tracheostomy, Foley and rectal stool bag during this admission.
Physical therapy who evaluated the patient during his hospitalization stay could not mobilize him very much because of his right groin femoral arterial line, however, this was maintained for longer than would have been ideal because of his intermittent decreases in blood pressure.
On [**2123-10-10**], his right groin A line was removed and he was able to sit up with the help of physical therapy and do more exercises with them.
His right PICC line remained in and will remain in because of his continued Vancomycin treatment but the nurses were able to measure blood pressure on his right arm.
