The patient's epidural needs to be changed over to a Dilaudid/bupivacaine solution for an increase in pain control.
From a cardiovascular standpoint, the patient's systolic blood pressure remained high in the 130s-180s, and was controlled with nitroglycerin drip.
During her stay in the PACU, the patient was slowly weaned off her nitroglycerin drip for a cuff pressure of less than 170.
By postoperative day #3, the patient was completely off her nitroglycerin drip and blood pressure was controlled with IV hydralazine.
Her J tube was draining a dark green fluid at this time, and tube feeds were started at 1.5 strength Impact with fiber at 10 cc/hour.
