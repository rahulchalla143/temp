Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 40754**] is a 41F with a PMH s/f a pineal germ cell tumer s/p chemotherapy and radiation many years ago complicated by hydrocephalus requiring a VP shunt, and complex partial seizures.
Currently she is Tracheostomy, PEG tube, and foley dependent, bed-bound, and with severe cognitive impairment.
Samples of her CSF, sputum, urine, blood, and stool were taken to look for a fever source, and with the help of an infectious disease consultation, she was empirically treated with vancomycin, cefepime, colistin, PO vancomycin, and acyclovir- given concern for VPS associated encephalitis, ventilator associated pneumonia, pan-resistant foley associated UTI, and c. diff colitis.
Unfortunately, this did not improve with treatment of her seizures or infections.
Neurology was consulted, and per their recommendations, dilantin was started and is being titrated for better seizure control.
Ativan was used as need for seizure control, then later replaced with daily scheduled Valium.
Hypercalcemia/Elev BUN:  During the latter days of her hospitalization, she started having elev BUN in 30-40 range.
Her tube feeds and free water flushes were also adjusted to maximize her free water intake.
Panhypopituitarism: During the first two days of her admission, she was given a stress dose of hydrocortisone, and once her tachycardia and fevers resolved, she was switched back to her usual prednisone dose.
She was maintained on levothyroxine as well.
Diabetes: She was maintained on an insulin sliding scale throughout her hospitalization.
She was maintained on her metoprolol.
Multidisciplinary family meeting: Given her poor prognosis, the decision was made to hold a family meeting with her neurosurgeon, parents, and the primary team.
