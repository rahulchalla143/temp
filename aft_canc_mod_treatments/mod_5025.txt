GI BLEEDING STUDY  [**2118-12-2**]  GI BLEEDING STUDY  Reason: LOCALIZE GI BLEED  HISTORY: 63-year-old on Coumadin, now passing blood clots per rectum.
DECISION:  INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for 90 minutes were obtained.
PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 379**] [**Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
A 0.035 Bentson guidewire was advanced into the abdominal aorta under fluoroscopic guidance.
A 4 French catheter was advanced over the wire into abdominal aorta.
The catheter was used to subsequently engage the origin of celiac axis and superior mesenteric arteries.
Based on the diagnostic findings, no further intervention was needed at this moment.
The catheter and the sheath were removed.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
GI BLEEDING STUDY  [**2118-12-4**]  GI BLEEDING STUDY  Reason: P/W BRBPR-PLEASE ASSESS GI BLEED  HISTORY: bright red blood per rectum  INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for 30 minutes were obtained.
RENAL U.S.  [**2118-12-12**] 11:54 AM  RENAL U.S.  Reason: obstruction  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 63 year old woman with CAD s/p MI, CHF, massive LGIB s/p 19 units of prbcs, now with ARF cr 0.8->1.9 in setting of labile HTN.
The left kidney measures 11.1 cm.
INDICATIONS FOR CONSULT: Investigation of transfusion reaction  CLINICAL/LAB DATA: The patient is a 63 year old female with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease (NSTEMI with stent placements in [**10-31**]) peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary edema, breast cancer and a recent diverticular bleed at the splenic flexure who was admitted for a GI bleed and falling hematocrit.
The patient has received 21 non-reactive red blood cell transfusions, 5 non-reactive plasma transfusions and two non-reactive platelet trasnfusions.
On [**12-12**], the patient received a unit of packed red blood cells (Hct was 28.2 to 29.3 on that date).
Her vitals pre transfusion (14:45) were: temp=97.9, pulse=60, resp=18, BP=106/palp.
The patient had received percocet 30 minutes prior to the transfusion.
BAS/UGI AIR/SBFT  [**2118-12-15**] 9:38 AM  BAS/UGI AIR/SBFT  Reason: obstruction, mass - cause for dysphagia  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 63 year old woman with massive LGIB, CAD s/p MI, now with hemolytic anemia, ARF, also with dysphagia to solids REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: obstruction, mass - cause for dysphagia HISTORY: 63-year-old woman with massive lower GI bleed, CAD, hemolytic anemia, acute renal failure, now with upper dysphagia to solids.
No structural abnormalities are detected in the region of the pharynx and cervical esophagus.
Colonoscopy [**2118-12-4**]: Indications: Gastrointestinal bleeding with positive tagged RBC scan at hepatic flexure  Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated her understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
The appendiceal orifice and ileo-cecal valve were identified.
The procedure was not difficult.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Bilious, non-bloody fluid was seen coming from the ileocecal valve suggesting that bleeding is localized distal to the ileocecal valve.
The patient was administered Conscious sedation anesthesia.
The procedure was not difficult.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Impression: Erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis Otherwise normal egd to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: Follow-up biopsy results Check H. pylori serology Esophageal manometry Additional notes: The attending was present for the entire procedure .
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 63 yo woman w/ CAD, labile HTN, CHF (mildly depressed EF, 1+AR, 2+MR), Afib, PVD, FM, breast CA in remission, s/p NSTMI in [**10-31**] c/b pulmonary edema, s/p 2 stents to D1 and LCx (failed), also c/b strep viridans endocarditis admitted with massive GI bleed.
Patient received a total of 19 units of pRBCs , 2 units of FFP, and reversed with 10 mg SC Vit K for this episode of GI bleeding.
Her blood pressure medications were held in the setting of GI bleed.
Patient was restarted on most of her outpatient meds including ACEI.
ACEI was discontinued and the patient's medications where tapered for a goal SBP of 160s.
Her urine remained dark and the workup for hemolysis began since patient had elevated LDH to [**2112**], haptoglobin <20 and elevated bilirubin to ~2.5.
DDx included delayed transfusion reaction (immune vs. non immune), G6PD deficiency given patient had received 1x Sulfa for +U/A.
Her blood smear remained inconclusive with rare schistocytes, bite cells and spherocytes.
It was also postulated that the patient may be hemolyzying due to sulfa drugs since she also received lasix with her blood transfusion.
A trial of lasix however did not induce further hemolysis.
She was guaiac negative prior to starting heparin on last admission.
She was also treated with Vit K and 2 units of FFP.
She will likely need surgical intervention should this occur again.
Interventional Radiology also performed angiography but was unwilling to perform embolization due to the risk of necrosis.
Importantly, patient was taken off Coumadin and continued on [**Month/Day (4) **]/[**Month/Day (4) **] as per Cardiology consultation.
She is also continued on a bowel regimen to maintain soft stool.
She was initially taken off all outpatient meds given her large GI bleed.
Once stabilized and transferred to the floor, her usual medications were restarted including CCB, ACEI, Hydral PO, clonidine patch, Imdur.
Her clonidine path, Hydral and ACEI and Aldactone were all discontinued.
She may also still need po Hydralazine for optimum control.
Patient received a renal MRI/MRA to rule out stenosis that was negative on the right and unable to assess on the left due to artifact from aorto-[**Hospital1 **] iliac stenting.
Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: Patient had transient episode during her last admission, spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm and was started on Coumadin, and sent out on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor and was to have an outpatient EP study.
Given her massive GI bleed Coumadin was discontinued.
Beta blocker was up titrated per EP recommendations.
Her dose of Statin was temporarily decreased to 40 mg daily (Atorvastatin) since this could have been exacerbating her renal failure.
Lasix was given between blood transfusions to prevent overload.
Patient was continued on beta blocker and Imdur.
Strep Viridans endocarditis/thrombus: Unclear based on [**Doctor Last Name 113**] results (no vegetations) on prior admission, surveillance cultures negative.
She was started on Penicillin to complete a course of antibiotics on last admission and d/ced home with PICC.
Beta blocker was up titrated with good control.
Patient was continued on a soft mechanical diet.
F/E/N: Cardiac diet/soft mechanical, monitored and replaced lytes as needed .
