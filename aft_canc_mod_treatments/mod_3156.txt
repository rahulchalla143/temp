Admission Date:  [**2150-2-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2150-2-16**]   Service:  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is an 84 year old man with a decreasing level of alertness and speech difficulties as well as coordination difficulties.
He was evaluated by Neurosurgery upon arrival to [**Hospital1 188**] and they recommended high dose steroids and an MRI for better evaluation of the mass.
The patient received four liters of normal saline at [**Hospital1 1444**] [**Location (un) 620**] and there was a systolic blood pressure of approximately the mid 90s with some tachycardia.
He received Levaquin and Flagyl for suspected pneumonia as well as Decadron 6 mg intravenously q. six for increased intracranial pressure secondary to increased intracranial mass.
Respirations 72 and saturation of 100% on three liters via nasal cannula.
He was adequately rehydrated with fluid and his blood pressure responded appropriate to normal saline boluses.
He was also started on lactated Ringers and free water secondary to the patient's hypernatremia.
He required Dopamine for blood pressure support.
The patient was noted to have some extravasation of the Dopamine subcutaneously and was given Phentolamine to reverse the subcutaneous infiltration of his Dopamine.
The patient's pressures stabilized on day number two and Dopamine blood pressure support was no longer needed.
Intracranial mass:  The patient was placed on Decadron for supposed likely brain metastases.
Neurosurgery felt that the patient should be placed on steroids and have an MRI to evaluate possible surgical options.
The patient was adequately rehydrated and his sodium was noticed to normalize.
Neurosurgery discussed the patient's options which included a combination of resection with probable large deficit as an outcome versus lung biopsy for tissue diagnosis and possible chemotherapy versus comfort measures only.
The patient's family decided, due to the patient's current state of health, that comfort measures only would be the most appropriate course of action.
Fentanyl patch, 25 to 100 micrograms per hour q.
Morphine sulfate one to two mg buccal mucosa p.r.n.
Morphine sulfate two to five mg subcutaneously p.r.n.
Ativan 1 mg p.r.n.
DISPOSITION:   The patient will be discharged to a Nursing Home for comfort only measures care.
