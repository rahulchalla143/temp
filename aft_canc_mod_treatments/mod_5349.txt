~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] W &W/O CONTRAST  [**2165-9-29**] 8:09 PM  FINDINGS: The vertebral body heights, alignment, and intervertebral disc spaces are preserved.
The vertebral body bone marrow signal is normal.
A right upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed via a thoracotomy on [**9-30**] without complication.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1352**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] orthopedic spine surgeon was available for intraoperative collaboration however the tumor was not invading the spinal structures and dissection was completed without the need for a spine specialist.
The patient was transferred to the floor post-operatively with a chest tube and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] drain in place.
He recovered well and he was encouraged to get out of bed on POD1 and incentive spirometry was encouraged.
He had an epidural placed pre-operatively that ceased to work for pain relief and he was converted to a PCA for pain control on POD1.
The chest tubes were left in place on water seal and his subcutaneous emphysema and a small stable pneumothorax remained stable and eventually decreased somewhat.
His chest tubes were clamped POD4.
He complained of moderately increasing right chest wall pain on POD4&5 and his pain medications were adjusted accordingly when chest x-rays revealed no underlying pathology.
His chest tubes were discontinued POD5 without complication.
He developed a fever in the midst of his transfusion and this was stopped immediately and investigated for a transfusion reaction.
He was started on oxycontin for a longer acting pain relief and this seemed to alleviate his pain except on his first movements from a stationary position.
He continued to be ambulatory frequently and used an incentive spirometer as directed.
