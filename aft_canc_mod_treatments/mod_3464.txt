She tolerated the procedure well and returned to the PACU in stable condition.
With the help of the pain service she was managed with Ketamine and a Dilaudid PCA post op.
She was subsequently transferred to the Surgical floor for further management.
Her blood sugars were well controlled for the first few days post op on low dose Lantus however as her intake improved her insulin needs increasd.
She was educated in insulin administration as this is new for her and glucometer checks were reinforced as she was instructed during her last admission.
She was started on clear liquids 4 days post op and her diet was slowly advanced over a twenty four hour period after bowel function returned.
Following the cessation of Ketamine and Dilaudid PCA she was managed with a Fentanyl patch 25 mcg/hr and Dilaudid 4-8 mg orally for breakthrough pain.
At that time she should be managed with oral narcotics for pain control.
After an uneventful post operative stay she was discharged home with VNA services for diabetic teaching and insulin administration and she will follow up with her PCP for further pain medication adjustment.
Her staples were removed prior to discharge.
