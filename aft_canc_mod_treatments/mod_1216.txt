He received a third unit PRBC on arrival to CCU for Hct 25 and bumped appropriately, after which his Hct stabilized and he required no further transfusions.
After groin hemostasis was achieved, he was started on a heparin drip.
He was monitored for PAD pressures with swan ganz catheter and gently diuresed for pressures consistently > 25.
blood pressure was optimized with nitro gtt (for HTN) and phenylephrine gtt (for hypotension) per study protocol during the post-op period.
Pt was quickly weaned off the drips and remained hemodynamically stable.
Per pt, his son lives next door and visits daily, so would be able to help out at home and with medications if needed.
# Anemia: pt lost approximately one liter of blood during procedure, received 3 units with appropriate increase to Hct 31.Pt also experienced some oozing at the site of his neck catheter and was thought to have a hematoma there.
patient was a difficult cross match so 6 units were matched prior to his arrival and another 3 after he required 3 units PRBC post-procedure.
# CAD: s/p CABG in [**2173**] with patent LIMA-LAD: continued ASA.
restarted metoprolol on POD#1.
#  Afib/ pacemaker: held coumadin for procedure and started pt on heparin drip after groin hemostasis achieved.
When Hct stable and there was no evidence of bleeding at the swan ganz catheter site, coumadin was restarted at home dose with heparin subQ for DVT ppx.
# Hypertension: restarted metoprolol on POD#2 as above  # Hyperlipidemia: continued pravastatin  # h/o renal artery stenosis: s/p stenting so pt started on lisinopril as above for HTN/cardioprotection  # foley catheter: nurse had trouble getting foley out on POD#3.
said they would not do anything beyond that so instructed them the primary team could go forward with their suggestions.
