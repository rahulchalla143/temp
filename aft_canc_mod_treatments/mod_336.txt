History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 3075**] is a 72-year-old woman who underwent a right nephrectomy several years ago for a right kidney cancer.
It has eroded through the duodenal wall and has been causing recalcitrant gastrointestinal bleeding necessitating continual transfusions of packed red blood cells.
The patient is now admitted for resection of the lesion by Whipple pancreaticoduodenectomy.

II Pancreas, Whipple procedure (E-Y): 1.
2.All resection margins are free of tumor.
The tumor morphology is consistent with that of a conventional (clear cell) renal cell carcinoma.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted on the day of surgery after undergoing pre-admission testing previously.
The patient underwent a Whipple procedure for excision of the mass in the head of her pancreas.
She tolerated the procedure well and was extubated post-op.
She remained NPO with an NG tube in place and was on bed rest immediately post-op.
The NG tube, epidural catheter, and the foley were removed on POD#3.
The patient was pain controlled with a PCA after the epidural was d/c'd.
The diet was advanced to clear liquids on POD#5 and Reglan was started.
Her JP drain was pulled on the evening of POD#5.
She continued to feel abdominal discomfort the following day and she required fluid boluses for blood pressure control on the night of POD#[**7-16**].
While she required quite a bit of fluid before she went into the operating room, she was reasonably stable hemodynamically but had a low urine output and the operation was performed on an emergency basis.
A revision of the pancreaticojejunostomy was performed and a feeding G-J tube was placed.
Antibiotics were started (Vanco, Levo, Flagyl) for positive cultures from the OR (strep viridans, enterococcus, & gram-negative rods).
She was continued on diuresis and did well after this episode.
She also had a very brief episode of Afib and was started on an amiodarone drip on [**10-9**].
She swiftly converted back to normal sinus and remained stable thereafter on PO amiodarone.
