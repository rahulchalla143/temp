He was immediately admitted to the MICU on [**2116-11-18**] where he was found to require dopamine for maintenance of blood pressure.
This was thought to be secondary to fluid overload after mobilization of fluids after receiving several liters of hydration as per the sepsis protocol and pressure support.
The patient was given a ten day course of Zosyn which he tolerated well for the PNA and a thoracenetesis with chest tube placement for the presumed malignant pleural effusion (2.5L of exudative fluid was removed, however 3 sets of cytology all returned negative for malignant cells).
The patient subsequently recieved a pleurodiesis from interventional pulmonary as well.
However this was transient and resolved with supportive measures.
