gentleman with significant CAD hx, s/p MI x 4, RCA stents x 4 (most recent placed in [**2147**]), COPD, bladder cancer (w/lung mets), who presented to [**Hospital3 1280**] with chest pain w/jaw and L arm pain similar to previous MI.
Pt had to stop ASA and Plavix 1 month ago due to ongoing signficant hematuria related to bladder cancer tx which required blood transfusions and PRN 3 way irrigation.
On cath he was found to have thrombosis of the RCA stent which was treated with balloon angioplasty in addition to 90% proximal LAD lesion.
Got plavix & aspirin from EMS.
Cath at [**Hospital3 1280**] found to have thrombosis of the RCA stent which was treated with balloon angioplasty in addition to 90% proximal LAD lesion.
Transferred for PCI of LAD lesion which was successful with placement of another BMS.
Restarted on plavix 75cc, aspirin, metoprolol.
He should continue aspirin and plavix for one month.
His atovastatin was increased from 20 mg daily to 80 mg.  Initiation of lisinopril may also be considered as an outpatient.
Had to be taken off plavix and aspirin b/c he was having significant hematuria which required multiple transfusions; bleeding from tumor.
After stopping plavix and aspirin approximately 1-2mo ago, hematuria had resolved completely -- 1 week prior to MI for which pt was admitted.
Initially on admission, urine was clear after cath and pt doing well.
On day he was about to be discharged ([**2154-5-9**]) he acutely developed significant hematuria requiring blood transfusion, urgent urology consult for placement of foley for irrigation and transfer to CCU.
Placement of foley was very difficult even with cystoscopy, so patient was transferred to OR on east for rigid cystoscopy which revealed 1.5 U clotted blood in bladder with no evidence of active bleed and left bladder metastasis.
A 3-way catheter was placed to allow CBI.
He was started on cefazolin for 3 days periprocedurally.
His continuous bladder irrigation was later stopped and the patient's urine remained clear without clots.
He is discharged with a foley in place and will follow-up with his outpatient urologist.
# COPD: Stable no issues currently; on home singulair and spiriva.
# Anxiety: Given recent cancer diagnosis and stresses related to medical issues patient was having worsening anxiety symptoms and was given ativan to help w/anxiety symptoms.
# HTN: Had been stable on home regimen so continued home dose of metoprolol; he was no not on lisinopril at home, but this should be considered in the future as an outpatient.

Because of procedure, pt was switched to ISS; held home metformin, glipizide and januvia which were restarted at discharge.
# GERD: stable on nexium while inpatient.
