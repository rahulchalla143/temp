Prior to her planned take back for a second look, she developed sudden left lower extremity ischemia which required a left femoral artery embolectomy on [**2152-8-24**] and following her embolectomy, she was started on a heparin drip.
Her planned 2nd look was performed on [**2152-8-25**] where she underwent a washout, repair of pelvic floor hernia with Stratus mesh, mucous fistula creation, temporary closure of abdomen, rigid proctosigmoidoscopy.
A final operation was performed on [**2152-8-28**] where a washout, creation of ileal colonic anastomosis (side-to-side hand-sewn two layer), and closure of abdomen with Stratus mesh (10x25cm) via complex closure was performed.
She had a delayed return of bowel function and was started on TPN with her starting to take POs in mid-[**Month (only) 359**] and recently started on Coumadin  She was doing well until [**9-23**] when she started to have melena from her ostomy.
She continued to have melena from her ostomy and her aspirin, heparin and Coumadin were held with an INR of 2.6 on [**2152-9-25**] down to 2.2 on [**2152-9-26**].
She underwent a tagged RBC scan this evening which localized to the right upper quadrant and received 1 unit of FFP and 2 units of plateets.
Past Medical History: cervical cancer s/p radiation to pelvis 34 years ago, GERD, TAAA/AAA (4.2cm), ECHO [**8-23**] (EF 55-60%, mild mitral regurg), pSBO, HTN, Last colonoscopy [**4-12**] failed [**1-5**] sigmoid stricture  -[**2152-7-4**] lap chole for gangrenous cholecystitis -[**2152-7-22**] lap LOA/SBR for adhesions/pSBO -[**2152-8-22**] exlap, cystoscopy with bilateral ureteral stents, resection ischemic/necrotic small bowel, debridement of necrotic rectum, sigmoid and descending colon with temporary abdominal closure -[**2152-8-24**] Left femoral exploration CFA embolectomy -[**2152-8-25**] 2nd look exlap/washout, repair of pelvic floor hernia with Stratus mesh (16x20cm), mucous fistula creation, temporary closure of abdomen, rigid proctosigmoidoscopy -[**2152-8-28**] 3rd look exlap/washout, creation of ileal colonic anastomosis side-to-side hand-sewn two layer), closure of abdomen with Stratus mesh (10x25cm) via complex closure.
Endomucosal resection was not attempted given recent GI bleed.
Additional clip was placed over another anastomotic ulcer.
Patient received two units of blood total and HCT stabilized at 34.
GI was consulted and performed colonoscopy on [**9-28**].
OSH attending was called regarding transfer back to [**Hospital **] hospital, but attending requested that patient be re-stabilized on her heparin gtt before transferring back.
The patient was transferred to the floor on [**9-28**] and became therapuetic on heparin gtt on [**2152-9-30**] at 0300 and has remained therapuetic since then running at heparin drip of 1200 units/hour.
She was continued on TPN until [**2152-9-30**] in the evening as she was tolerating regular diet, although PO intake was limited.
She did not have bleeeding from ostomy site since [**2152-9-28**] after the clipping procedure and has had stable hematocrit since then, as it was checked daily.
Her wound vac was changed on Friday [**2152-9-29**] last a nd her abdominal wound had good granulation tissue.
Vascular surgery was consulted at the request of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 91608**] and agreed that the patient needed long term anticoagulation of heparin with a bridge to coumadin and thought that there was no prophylactic surgical intervention at this time to prevent further atheroembolisms.
Patient was started on coumadin bridge [**2152-10-1**] with 5mg Coumadin and continued on heparin drip.
