Compression of the right lateral and third ventricles, with entrapment and severe dilatation of the left lateral ventricle.
However, the detection of liver lesions with ultrasound in a cirrhotic liver is limited.
This finding was discussed with the neurosurgery team who felt no immediate surgical intervention was needed and followup CT scan was recommended.
An emergent CT head was obtained following transfer to the MICU which showed large right sided subdural hematoma with subfalcine and uncal herniation.
The neurosurgery team felt that given the patient's end stage liver disease, any surgical procedure would likely be lethal to her.
The patient was given mannitol according to neurosurgery recommendations.
Following discussion wtih the health care proxy, the decision was made to proceed with comfort measures only.
Kidney donation was considered but ultimately declined due to the patient's elevated creatinine by the following morning, despite hemodynamic support overnight with vasopressors.
She was seen in [**Hospital 1326**] Clinic for possible transplant evaluation, but was not a current candidate given recent drinking ([**3-3**] last drink).
Her diuretics were held secondary to hypotension and she was continued on naldolol with holding parameters.
Her INR was 4.1 on admission contiuned to trend up, additionally, her bilirubin also continued to trend up 51.8 prior to MICU transfer.
This was likely secondary to over diuresis with lasix and spironalactone as well as poor po intake.
Her diuretics were held and the patient was given IVF to maintain SBP above 80.
