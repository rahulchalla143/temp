Patient was given one sublingual nitro and started on morphine for pain control.
Patient was transferred to the ICU for further management.

Two cells contained an extra copy of chromosome 8 (TRISOMY 8) and a TRANSLOCATION of chromosomes 15 and 17.
This translocation is associated with PML-RARA fusion and is a characteristic finding in acute promyelocytic (M3) leukemia.
----------------INTERPHASE FISH ANALYSIS, 100-300 CELLS------------------- nuc ish(PML,RARA)x3(PML con RARAx2)[89/100] FISH evaluation for a PML-RARA rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the LSI PML/RARA Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for PML at 15q22 and RARA at 17q21.1 and is interpreted as ABNORMAL.
Rearrangement was observed in 89/100 nuclei, which exceeds the normal range (up to 1% dual rearrangement) for this probe in our laboratory.
Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells isolated from this peripheral blood express myeloid associated antigens (CD13, CD33 (bright), CD15 (bright, subset), express CD64, CD71, lack B and T cell associated antigens, are CD10 (cALLAa) negative, and are negative for CD34, HLA-DR, CD14, CD41, CD11C, CD56 and Glycophorin A.  Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by acute myeloid leukemia.
However, correlation with concurrent cytogenetic findings is recommended for further characterization.
A hypodense lesion with smaller hemorrhagic component is also seen in the right occipital lobe, with two additional non-hemorrhagic hypodense lesions seen in the left cerebellar hemisphere and the right parieto-occipital cortex.
No interval change since [**2148-9-24**], with unchanged appearance of right frontal parenchymal hematoma with associated edema, local mass effect and stable degree of leftward shift of normally-midline structures.
LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: [**2148-10-3**] 1:45 PM Findings: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] of right subclavian vein was performed and shows normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 yo man h/o severe emphysema who presented with a new diagnosis of APML and NSTEMI with EF 30%, s/p intubation [**9-20**] with extubation on [**9-27**], found to have large IPH, multiple strokes, and endocarditis.
He was treated with ATRA and hydroxyurea initially and when his WBC was <10K, his hydroxyurea was stopped.
He also received steroids initially for prophylaxis of ATRA syndrome and this was gradually weaned.
He was monitored for tumor lysis and DIC and transfused blood products prn to keep his fibrinogen >100 and INR <1.5.
Given his concurrent IPH (see below), antiplatelet & anticoagulant agents are contraindicated and he was medically managed with nitrates, beta-blockers, low-dose ACE-i and a statin.
A hypodense lesion with smaller hemorrhagic component was also seen in the right occipital lobe, with two additional non-hemorrhagic hypodense lesions seen in the left cerebellar hemisphere and the right parieto-occipital cortex.
Haldol 0.5mg IV was used [**Hospital1 **] prn for mood stabilization as he refused.
# Respiratory Distress/Hypoxia: On presentation, he was hypoxic and required oxygen support by nasal cannula (up to 6L).
Following his IPH, he was intubated for airway protection on [**2148-9-20**] with successful extubation on [**2148-9-27**].
He is s/p 8 day course of cefepime and levofloxacin for his pneumonia.
Following extubation, he was maintained on his home COPD medications and was maintaining stable O2 sats on room air.
Added vancomycin (d1=[**9-25**]) for MRSA endocarditis coverage and started ceftriaxone (d1=[**9-27**]).
Per ID, 6 week course of antibiotics recommended.
Given his recent IPH, anticoagulation was not an option.
The PICC line was removed on [**2148-10-3**] and a peripheral IV was placed.
