Admission Date:  [**2129-7-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-8-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2052-11-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Hydralazine / Heparin,Porcine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**] Chief Complaint: GI bleed Respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Ultrafiltration Hemodialysis  History of Present Illness: (History obtained from son and OSH record) 76 yo F with history of CKD recently started on hemodialysis (2 cycles as of [**7-20**]), h/o CVA x2, h/o RCC s/p nephrectomy, and recent known [**Hospital **] transferred from the OSH to the ICU for planned GI work-up; however, was in respiratory distress requiring intubation in the [**Hospital1 **] ED.
Patient reported having had at least 1 week of melena and 1 day of hematemesis on [**2129-7-15**].
Subsequently, she was on Protonix gtt and IV hydration with GI consult.
She apparently underwent an endoscopy by DR. [**Last Name (STitle) 30885**], which showed a bleeding friable large pyloric channel stalk polyp 4-5 cm as well as gastric mucosal friability.
During her time in the OSH, she was initiated on hemodialysis per her nephrologist's recommendations.
Patient received a cycle of dialysis today before transfer.
She was placed on BiPAP then was intubated for hypoxic respiratory distress on fentanyl and propofol.
Apparently, OG tube lavage did not show blood.
She was given protonix 80 mg IV 1x, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and zosyn.
Upon transfer, HR 58, BP 142/58, RR 16, O2Sat 100% on FiO2 80%, TV 400, RR set 18, and PEEP of 10 with fentanyl and propofol for sedation.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was quickly extubated without complication on [**7-21**] after HD ultrafiltration.
She has been on 2L NC since.
She is on plavix as an outpt for hx of CVA, but this has been held in setting of GIB.
She has received total 2 units (one today, one on [**7-23**]).
She is on cefazolin with Hemodialysis (2/2/3 g after HD on M/W/F, today day 7 of 14 - last day [**8-3**]).
Patient has not been on heparin at [**Hospital1 18**], but unclear if received at OSH or with hemodialysis.
In terms of ESRD, patient received HD session prior to transfer to the floor.
Past Medical History: (per [**Hospital **] Hospital record) - Upper GIB from bleeding large pyloric channel stalk polyp with diffuse gastric friability - Lower GIB - history of CVAs x2, was on plavix (until OSH admission.
Did not tolerate Aggrenox per OSH record) - CKD stage 4, on dialysis (2 cycles as of [**7-20**]) - h/o renal cell cancer s/p nephrectomy - HTN - HLD - Anemia of chronic disease   Social History: - lived at home with son - has 3 grown children: son [**Name (NI) **], daughter [**Name (NI) **] and another daughter - no tobacco or alcohol use per son - has been physically inactive for at least 1 year - stays at home most of the time, but has a good friend that she talks to twice a day   Family History: - father deceased at 66 with MI - mother deceased at 91 to colon cancer - 1 sister is in good health   Physical Exam: On admission: Vitals: T:97.1 BP:109/67 P:77 R:17 O2: 97%, CMV Vt450, PEEP 10, RR set at 18 General: intubated HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM Neck: supple, no LAD Lungs: bronchial breath sounds, clear to auscultation, no w/c/r appreciated CV: RRR, normal S1 and S2, soft [**2-10**] holosystolic and diastolic murmur, no rub or gallops Abd: soft, NT, ND, BS present, no guarding, no organomegaly, + old scar GU: Foley draining clear urine Ext: Cool extremities, 1+ edema to the thighs, 2+ DP and radial pulses bilaterally, no clubbing or cyanosis.

A single-piece polypectomy was then performed using a hot snare in the gastric polyp.
Brief Hospital Course: 76 yo F with CKD on HD, h/o CVA, h/o RCC s/p nephroctomy presents after recently initiating hemodialysis with GI bleed transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation, found to have troponin leak, also found to have profound hypothyroidism and ?MSSA bacteremia.
Ultrafiltration and hemodialysis performed with marked improvement in respiratory status.
She continued to have large pleural effusions and oxygen requirement of 3L NC on the floor.
Ultrafiltration was limited by blood pressures; because pt's blood pressures could not tolerate pulling off significant volume, she will require rehabilitation stay for period of time until enough fluid is removed to decrease oxygen requirement back to baseline.
Pt does not require oxygen at home.
# ?NSTEMI vs Demand Ischemia Cardiac enzymes elevated with troponin 0.22 on admission and downtrended slowly, likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of GI bleed.
Patient was not given ASA or heparin in setting of her GIB.
Beta blocker (metoprolol) and captopril were started.
She continued on home rosuvastatin.
Aspirin 81mg and Plavix 75mg were held temporarily due to the risk of reemergent GI bleed.
Per GI recommendations, the patient was started on Aspirin 81mg daily [**7-29**], while hematocrit continued to be stable, and she was transitioned from Aspirin 81mg to Plavix 75mg on [**8-2**].
She was also transitioned from captopril as an inpatient to lisinopril as an outpatient as its long half-life allows for once-daily dosing.
Maintained on IV pantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Required 1 unit of pRBC transfusion for Hct drop of ~ [**10-15**] points over the course of [**2-6**] days but no obvious melena or BRBPR.
GI was consulted and performed EGD with removal of polyp.
Plavix 75mg was restarted in [**8-2**] for stroke risk.
Patient was recently initiated on hemodialysis through left arm fistula, although transplant surgery does not believe the site to be infected.
She was initially started on vancomycin for presumed MRSA, which then transitioned to cefazolin for MSSA and ease of dosing with dialysis.
Cefazolin was dosed at dialysis as follows: 2g IV Mondays after HD, 2g IV Wednesdays after HD, 3g IV on Fridays after HD.
The course was completed with the last dose of cefazolin was given [**2129-8-3**].
# Hypothyroidism Patient was found to have TSH>50, for which she was started on levothyroxine 50mcg daily.
Patient did not receive heparin products while in this hospital given her GIB.
Per nephrology, heparin was not being used with her ultrafiltration.
It is unclear if she got heparin at the OSH.
Medications such as vancomycin and PPI could also potentially cause thrombocytopenia, and patient is now on Cefazolin.
Anti-PF4 antibody was negative and platelet counts improved spontaneously.
Patient was recently started on dialysis (2 session) by the time of her transfer to the ICU.
Epo was held off given the history of renal cell carcinoma.
Continued on Rosuvastatin Calcium 40 mg po daily and held off on plavix in the setting of the GI bleed.
Plavix was restarted on [**8-2**].
As her clinical pictures, her SBP also improved, requiring reinitiation of the beta blocker.
She was started on metoprolol as well as captopril, and will switch from captopril to lisinopril at discharge.

Here, you were having significant difficulty breathing in the Emergency [**Hospital1 **], so you were intubated and placed on a ventilator machine for one day in the medical intensive care unit.
With another round of hemodialysis, they were able to take off enough fluid to make your breathing better, so the tube could be removed without any difficulties.
You also had an endoscopy in the intensive care unit during which we removed a large bleeding polyp in your stomach.
You were given two units of blood transfusion.

You were transfused two units of blood after which your blood counts have been stable.
The following changes have been made to your medications: 1. please stop your labetalol 2. please stop your calcitriol 3. please start protonix (pantoprazole) 40 mg every 12 hours 4. please start metoprolol tartrate 37.5mg every 12 hours   *** please hold metoprolol on mornings before dialysis *** 5. please start lisinopril 10 mg once daily 6. please start levothyroxine 50 micrograms daily (please take this medication on an empty stomach an hour prior to taking your other medications) .
You may have an area of narrowing with part of your fistula, so you will need a study called a fistulagram to further evaluate whether or not you will need a procedure to fix it.
