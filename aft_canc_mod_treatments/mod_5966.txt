After discussion between ICU team and HCP, it was decided not to continue anticoagulation given risks (ie known rectal mass).
Aspiration PNA was also likely contributing to her hypoxia as there was some evidence of consolidation on chest CT.  She was initially on abx, then stopped, but restarted with levaquin upon review of this CT.
Though CHF may have been a small part of her hypoxia, given that her hypoxia resolved without diuresis, this is less likely.
Hypotension likely from volume depletion as she responded well to IVF overnight.
Continued aspirin 325mg.
Once hypotension resolved, restarted beta blocker at low dose atenolol 12.5 mg daily.
