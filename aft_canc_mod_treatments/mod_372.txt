PROCEDURE: The patient underwent radical cystectomy and transverse colon urinary diversion.
He had undergone radiation therapy for prostate carcinoma in the past and therefore was elected to have a transverse colon diversion.
He required large amounts of postoperative fluids due to the length of procedure secondary to intraabdominal adhesions.
Progressively the nasogastric tube and other tubes were reviewed.
He was maintained NPO until flatus had been passed.
