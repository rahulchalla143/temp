Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with severe AS, CHF, HTN, [**Age over 90 2320**], who was admitted to the orthopedic service initially for treatment of her R-femoral neck fracture, but then transferred to the medicine service when it was realized that she had a multifocal pneumonia on CXR.
She underwent right hip hemiarthroplasty on [**2143-8-28**] with successful fixation.
Her pain was not well-controlled post-operatively, as doses of morphine were associated with significant hypotension.
# Pulmonary embolism - On the medicine floor after her right hip arthroplasty, the patient experienced dyspnea, increasing oxygen requirement, and hypotension.
She was on lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.
She had a TTE that showed a dilated right ventricle compared to the left side, consistent with PE and she was started on a heparin gtt.
She was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for pneumonia acquired in a healthcare setting (she lives in a nursing home) and received 7 days of this treatment.
# Atrial fibrillation - patient was in atrial fibrillation with RVR before transfer to the CCU.
She was hypotensive during this time and did not respond to IV metoprolol.
She was started on an amiodarone gtt and DC cardioverted back into sinus rhythm.
She was continued on amiodarone and metoprolol for rate/rhythm control and remained in sinus rhythm throughout her hospitalization.
# Acute renal failure - patient had elevated BUN and creatinine upon admission to the CCU, and progressively decreased her urine output.
# Pump - Patient with TTE that showed LVEF > 55% and PCWP >18, [**2-1**]+ MR, Severe AS (valve area 0.8-1.0) but poor output with lasix after episodes of hypotension.
The patient was likely slightly volume overloaded with increased JVP but her blood pressures would not tolerate lasix and her kidneys stopped responding.
# Thrombocytosis - Has been stable during this admission and it appears to be a chronic problem for this patient with platelet levels in the 500-600's.
