A biliary stent was placed within the wall stent and subsequent good flow of bile was demonstrated after stent placement.
A metallic bile duct stent is in position and unchanged when compared to the ERCP of [**2137-10-29**].

She was taken to ERCP again, where sludge was extracted and a new stent placed.
She received IV fluids and initially was broadly covered with IV zosyn.
Decision was made that she did not need an open surgical biopsy of her hepatobiliary mass, given the positive cytology from the brushings taken during ERCP.
She was noted to have chronic portal vein thrombosis on her CT scan, which was also noted on a prior admission.
She was treated for her H.Pylori with protonix, Amxicillin, and Clarithromycin.
Palliative care was consulted for management of her pain, and started her on oxycodone standing, with prns.
