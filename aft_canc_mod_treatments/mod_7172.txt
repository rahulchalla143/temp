Has not been doing his breathing exercises for greater than one week.
He subsequently was intubated with Succinyl Choline and Etomidate for respiratory distress and increased work of breathing.
The patient received Levofloxacin times one, Clindamycin 600 mg times one, Vancomycin 1 gram times 1.
He was also given one liter of normal saline as well as Ativan 2 mg times three doses as well as Famotidine.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin which causes anaphylaxis.
Ampicillin which causes a rash.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 99.1, heart rate 90 (paced), blood pressure 107/56, respiratory rate 23 sating 99% on ventilator with a tidal volume of 700 and respiratory rate of 12, PEEP of 8 and FIO2 of 100%  The patient is ill and pale appearing and sedated.
An attempt to readjust his Endotracheal tube resulted in extubation and the patient was re-intubated with decreased O2 sats immediately following intubation to 60% and subsequent hypertension.
His O2 sat was recovered but then decreased again with hypotension, requiring Dopamine for blood pressure support and oxygenation were improved with her Coumadin.
The patient was maintained on broad spectrum antibiotics with Levofloxacin, Clindamycin and Vancomycin.
There was attempted thoracentesis on [**10-17**] with no recovery of fluid.
Cardiac echo was obtained which showed a depressed ejection fraction from 20 to 30%  The patient was intermittently placed on pressors but then became hypotensive despite maximal dose of Levothroid, Dopamine and fluid resuscitation on [**2200-10-19**].
The patient continued to spike fevers despite over a week of therapy on Levofloxacin, Clindamycin, Vancomycin.
