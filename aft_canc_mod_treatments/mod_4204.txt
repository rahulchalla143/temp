On the evening of POD 2 she developed worsening back pain and required an increase in IV pain medication for breakthrough pain.
In the morning of POD3 however the patient developed an episode of delerium that cleared over 20-30 minutes, likely related to pain medication and muscle relaxants and exhaustion.

You should wear your brace when out of bed or when your head of bed is above 30 degrees.
Take your pain medication as instructed; you may find it best if taken in the morning when you wake-up for morning stiffness, and before bed for sleeping discomfort.
Pain medication should be used as needed when you have pain.
Do not take any anti-inflammatory medications such as Motrin, Advil, Aspirin, and Ibuprofen etc.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as pain medicine (narcotics) can cause constipation.
We recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.
?Please return to the office in [**7-14**] days (from date of surgery) for removal of your staples.
