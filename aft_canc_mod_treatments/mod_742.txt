BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2173-3-17**], Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] was transferred from the Bone Marrow Transplant service to the Fenard Intensive Care Unit for management of rapid atrial fibrillation up to a heart rate of the 150s that was unresponsive to po and intravenous Metoprolol.
Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] had been admitted to the Bone Marrow Transplant team for fever and neutropenia and started on Vancomycin and Cefepime.
However, Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] continued to spike fevers and was begun on Ampicillin, transitioned to Voriconazole and then restarted on Ampicillin and Caspofungin for possible fungal pneumonia.
On chest CT Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] was noted to have bilateral pulmonary opacities whose appearance appeared most consistent with a fungal process, especially given his continued fevers on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Vancomycin 1 gram b.i.d.
Cefepime 2 grams intravenously t.i.d.
Caspofungin 50 mg intravenously q.d.
Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d.
Metoprolol 50 mg p.o.
Acyclovir 400 mg intravenously t.i.d.
Voriconazole which was changed to Caspofungin above.
Lasix 120 mg p.o.
Imdur 60 mg q.d.
Zestril 40 mg p.o.
Lopressor 100 mg t.i.d.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Levofloxacin 250 mg q.d.
His repeat sodium and potassium are 134 and 4.0.
His AST was 41, ALT 46, alkaline phosphatase 95, total bilirubin 1.0, albumin 3.5, calcium 8.5, phosphorous 2.7, magnesium 1.9, Vancomycin peak was 27.6.
Atrial fibrillation:  On transfer Diltiazem drip was started for rate control.
In addition, he was continued on Lopressor 100 mg p.o.
Therefore, his Digoxin dose was increased to 0.5 p.o.
Per Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 401**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], Mr. [**Known lastname 19064**] outpatient cardiologist, recommendations, decision was made to hold off on Amiodarone.
Therefore, decision was made to treat Mr. [**Known lastname 19064**] atrial fibrillation conservatively with a goal of rate control while trying to treat his underlying pulmonary infection.
On [**2173-3-19**] he was transitioned from the intravenous Diltiazem drip to Diltiazem and Lopressor p.o.
His antibiotic coverage for fungal organisms was broadened with Ampicillin and Caspofungin for empiric Aspergillosis ......... treatment.
Given the progression of the pulmonary infiltrates, the Infectious Disease service was concerned that his antibiotic coverage and fungal coverage were inadequate.
Ceftriaxone 1 gram q.d.
It was arranged for Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] to have video-assisted thoracic surgery procedure done by the Thoracic Surgical service.
His chest tube was able to be pulled on [**2173-3-26**] without incidence.
He was able to be weaned from face mask to nasal cannula oxygen post procedure without difficulty.
He was not receiving any aspirin or subcutaneous Heparin at the time of the right MCA infarct.
Per Neurology he was initially started on Neo-Synephrine with intravenous fluids to maintain his systolic blood pressure in the 140s.
This study was limited because Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] was unable to drink oral contrast, and he could not have intravenous contrast at this time secondary to acute renal failure.
Due to the concern for emboli to the spleen in the setting of a recent right MCA cerebrovascular accident, Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] was started on intravenous Heparin.
It was felt that this was possibly secondary to his AmBisome or possibly ATN from hypotension in the setting of receiving Lopressor and Diltiazem for control of his atrial fibrillation.
Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] continued to have gentle hydration of his kidneys, and his medications were renally dosed to minimize their toxicity.
He was initially off aspirin secondary to his thrombocytopenia.
Once his platelet count was over 50, Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] was restarted on his aspirin for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure:  Mr. [**Known lastname 9817**] had a history of congestive heart failure for which he was on Lasix and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor as an outpatient.
Secondary to his renal failure, his Lasix was held during his hospital stay in the Intensive Care Unit.
Mantle cell lymphoma status post chemotherapy:  Mr. [**Known lastname 19064**] mantle cell lymphoma appeared to be in remission during his stay in the Intensive Care Unit.
