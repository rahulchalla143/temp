He received several units of blood during this visit per records, but the patient does not recall this.
He received a total 4 units pRBC and hematocrit remained persistenly ~30.
He underwent colonoscopy [**4-8**] showing clots and evidence of recent bleeding (none active) in the sigmoid area.
A surgical evaluation was obtained, and embolization was recommended.
On [**4-9**] the patient received 2 units RBCs, and was started on protonix.
A PICC line was placed and Hct remained stable at 31.3.
After arrival to the floor he received 500ml NS for rehydration.
Note is made of variant anatomy with splenic and a replaced right hepatic artery arising from the SMA.
He was transferred to the SIRS team on [**2183-4-11**] from the ICU for further management of a recent lower GI bleed.
However, because the bleed was slow, IR did not think embolization would be useful.
He remained NPO, on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], and was persistently hemodynamically stable with SBP 120s.
PICC was placed for access given difficult phlebotomy and recurrent difficult IV placement.
His daily aspirin was stopped pending this evaluation.
He was started on pantoprazole 40mg PO daily.
Both rate control and anticoagulation were held given recent bleed and maintenance of sinus rhythm.
The home medication diltiazem was stopped because the patient remained in sinus rhythm throughout his stay.
# Medication changes: -Hold aspirin until d/w pcp and GI team -Hold Diltiazem until d/w pcp and GI team -Start protonix 40mg daily until GI follow-up .
