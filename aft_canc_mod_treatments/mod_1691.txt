HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2151-3-18**] and underwent a total gastrectomy with feeding jejunostomy performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Her pain was well controlled with an epidural, and the patient had an nasogastric tube that was placed to continuous level of suction.
On postoperative day #2, the patient's tube feeds were started at 1/2 strength at 20 cc/hr.
Her tube feeds were held but her epidural was discontinued.

A small bowel perforation was suspected, and a Foley catheter was placed, intravenous fluids were initiated, broad spectrum antibiotics were started and the patient was planned to go to the Operating Room for exploration.
The jejunostomy was repaired during this operation.
Later that evening, the patient developed respiratory distress with tachypnea and shallow breathing and shortness of breath.
Her arterial blood gases following sedation was 7.35, 31, 90, 18, and -7.
She was continued on Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
Aggressive fluid resuscitation was required for a hypotensive episode.
She was started on Levophed and given albumin to help with her low blood pressure.
Fluconazole was also added for further broad-spectrum coverage.
Her tube feeds were also restarted, and nutrition made recommendations for appropriate tube feeds.
Because of her heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, the patient was started on Coumadin.
As her blood pressures improved or remained stable, the patient was begun with Lasix diuresis.
A takedown of the jejunostomy and replacement of the jejunostomy tube was performed as well as lysis of adhesions.
