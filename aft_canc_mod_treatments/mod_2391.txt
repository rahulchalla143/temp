Admission Date:  [**2127-3-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-3-27**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9853**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: extubation PICC line placement and removal   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with recent admisison for PNA who presents from rehab with respiratory distress.
Patient has a PMH of HTN, Alzheimer's, and chronic anemia who presents from her rehab facility after intubation for respiratory distress.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 39348**] during which she was diagnosed with multifocal HAP for which she was treated with Vanc/Zosyn x 2 weeks.
Patient required intubation at that time due to hypoxia.
The patient was started on flagyl [**3-13**], to complete course on [**3-27**].
She was placed on NRB and her sats improved to 90-97%.
She was given [**1-5**]" nitropaste and intubated at rehab.
She was given versed 2mg, vanco 1gm and zosyn 4.5gm IV x1.
Hypertension, recently poorly controlled and fluctuating 2.
Also, incidentally noted is a left upper extremity approach PICC line with the distal tip of the catheter projecting over the superior vena cava.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 39350**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old Russian female with PMH of HTN, alzheimer's, recent CVA and PNA who was admitted from rehab with respiratory distress, requiring intubation and admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management.
# Respiratory failure: On ABG at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab the pt had a mixed hypoxemic and hypercarbic picture.
The patient was intubated at rehab.
On admission the pt didn't have any evidence of pneumonia (she had recently completed a course of antibiotics for nosocomial pneumonia), and PE seemed unlikely as the pt had been on subcutaneous heparin at rehab and her oxygenation improved with intubation.
On the day of extubation the pt was noted to have a leukocytosis and new infiltrate on chest xray, so a new course of antibiotics was initiated for a 7 day course for ventilator/hospital-acquired pneumonia (of Vancomycin and Cefepime) which she completed.
# History of CVA: During this admission ASA and statin were continued.
ASA was stopped when she placed on the heparin gtt (see below).
Statin was discontinued given her prognosis.
Beta blocker and ACEi were continued, ASA and statin were stopped as above.
This resolved with IV metoprolol and there were no further episodes.
Continued BB, ACE at home dose with holding parameters.
FEN: Pt was restarted on tube feeds following extubation.
Tube feeds are administered via NG tube.
She was started on a heparin gtt after consulting with neurology who felt that she was far enough out from her stroke to make anticoagulation safe.
She should be anticoagulated for a month (if goals of care do not change to hospice) but was not started on coumadin in case a PEG needs to be placed.
If her peripheral IV access fails, she may be anticoagulated with Lovenox in the meantime.
Given the risks of a central line, she should not return to the hospital specifically for line placement without discussing goals of care with the family.
# Code Status: During this admission there was some discussion of the pt's code status, as even though the pt's HCP [**Name (NI) 4248**] (her daughter) stated that the pt was DNR, the pt's grandson was [**Name2 (NI) **] that all treatments be pursued, including re-intubation if extubation was unsuccessful.
