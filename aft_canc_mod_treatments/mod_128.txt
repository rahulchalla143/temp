REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for abscess CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of abdomen and pelvis were obtained without administration of oral contrast.
Intravenous contrast was administered due to poor renal function.
There is branching hyperdensity in the liver which appears to follor the distribution of portal vein branches; findings are concerning for portal vein thrombosis.
Nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach.
A small locule of gas is seen on image 74 of series 2 in the anterior abdominal wall which may be related to medication injection.
A catheter is noted in the right femoral vein.
FINDINGS: A single AP portable supine radiograph reveals an endotracheal tube which terminates 6 cm above the carina.
The left internal jugular catheter and nasogastric tube are stable.

He initially required 2 vasopressor agents on arrival and was intubated for airway protection and to assist in correcting his severe acidosis.
Eventually the bleeding stopped and his hematocrit stabilized with medical measure including a Protonix drip and an octreotide drip.
He was weened off his vasopressor medications.
He had been taken off the liver transplant list at [**Hospital1 336**] in [**Month (only) 205**] due to his vertebral osteomyelitis and his long term prognosis was bleak.
In discussion with the family on HD 5, his code status was changed to DNR and the family decided that hemodialysis would not be acceptable to the patient given his living will.
At approximately 7pm, he began to spontaneously bleed from his mouth and blood was suctioned out of his OGT in large amounts.
He was initially stabilized with IVF and increased vasopressor medications.
However, in discussion with his HCP it was decided that further treatment would be in violation of his living will and the decision was made to make him comfort measures only.
He passed peacefully on [**2105-11-15**] at 8:20pm with doctors, nurses, and respiratory technicians at his beadside  Medications on Admission: vancomycin 750 mg daily actigall 600 mg tid pentasa [**Numeric Identifier 961**] mg tid vit k mvi protonix 40 mg po daily metformin 500 mg po bid xanax 0.5 mg po q8hr prn anxiety oxycodone 5 mg po q4hr prn pain MOM dulcolax prn tyelnol 650 mg po q4hr prn pain nadolol 40 mg qd   Discharge Medications: none  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Upper gastrointestinal bleed  Endstage liver disease  Ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis  Discharge Condition: Deceased  Discharge Instructions: none  Followup Instructions: none
