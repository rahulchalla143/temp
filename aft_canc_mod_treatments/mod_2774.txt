REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o abdominal aortic aneurysm CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
A small pneumothorax is seen on the left, with a chest tube in place.
Lung bases demonstrate emphysematous changes, as well as suggestion of bronchiectasis.
Within a right lower lobe bronchus, a 3 mm focus of debris is noted, possibly representing aspirated mucus, though could be followed on future examinations.
Differential considerations include colon carcinoma or acute diverticulitis.
Chest tube removal [**2-19**].
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 57 M COPD admitted to OSH with H Flu PNA c/b NSTEMI(peak trop I 2.52), and large left PTX now s/p left chest tube placement transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for "difficulties oxygenating."
-OSH course ([**Date range (1) 58794**]):    Pt was admitted to OSH on [**2181-1-28**] with hypoxia, cough, leukocystosis w/bandemia and hypotension.
He was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Treatment was initiated with antibiotics (CTX, levoquin) for PNA, and steroids for COPD flare.
Pt ruled in for NSTEMI, however due to hemodynamic instability, pt did not receive cardiac catheterization.
Pt aspirated tube feeds (found in ETT) and PNA coverage expanded to flagyl.
A chest tube was placed urgently by CT surgery for a pneumothorax and the pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
-[**Hospital1 18**] MICU COURSE ([**Date range (1) 58795**]):    Pt was admitted directly to MICU on dopamine where he was found to be febrile to 101.2, hypotensive to SBP of 70s.
The patient was initially started on MUST protocol for presumed sepsis.
He finished his course of antibiotics on [**2181-2-18**], pressors were weaned off, pneumothorax resolved, chest tube was removed on [**2181-2-19**] and extubated successfully on [**2181-2-18**].
The patient was placed on ASA and statin for her NSTEMI, however b-blockers and ACE inhibitors were held due to hypotension.
Pt also received CT demonstrating colonic thickening.
-[**Hospital1 18**] MICU COURSE ([**Date range (1) 58796**]):   Patient was found to have coffee-ground emesis/melena and hypotension and was therefore re-transferred to unit following several boluses of fluid to maintain perfusion pressure.
However, patient was found to be bacteremic with MRSA and was treated with vancomycin IV 1.75g q12hours to attain a therapeutic trough level.
Pt was intubated at OSH for respiratory distress complicated by pneumothorax and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for difficult oxygenation.
At [**Hospital1 18**], pt finished course of abx and pneumothorax resolved with chest tube.
Pt was successfully extubated, and chest tube removed without complication following resolution of air leak.
PNA:  Pt tested positive for H.Flu at OSH and received ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.
Coverage was expanded at OSH after aspiration event.
Coverage was expanded to Vancomycin, levofloxacin, Flagyl and Ceftaz at [**Hospital1 18**].
Pt finished 14 day course of antibiotics and had minimal sputum following completion of course.
Patient was managed with stress dose steroids and nebs as needed without acute issues, and had no evidence of respiratory distress resulting from obstructive physiology.
PTX: Patient had chest tube placed at outside hospital with successful reduction in size of pneumothorax from 75%-20% of lung and did not have any evidence of tension pneumothorax despite question of difficulty oxygenating.
On hospital day 11, however, patient underwent a water seal trial with continued resolution of pneumothorax.
Therefore, on hospital day 13, patient had chest tube removed successfully.
However, it was noted at the time of removal that patient still had persistent leak of air from thoracic cavity from the chest tube site, and sutures were placed at the chest tube site to aid in closure.
Indeed, patient had upper GI bleed while on heparin, and therefore no further anticoagulation was administered.
Furthermore, given initial hypotension, beta blockade was held, and patient was only given aspirin and statin for treatment of coronary artery disease.
Patient to followup with cardiology following stabilization of critical care issues.
Pt was seen by GI, who recommended conservative therapy with PPI [**Hospital1 **], avoid NSAIDS, and transfusion as necessary.
Pt was transfused 2units of PRBCs ---Cont [**Hospital1 **] PPI and avoid NSAIDS.
However given acuity of pt's recent NSTEMI, risk of bowel prep and colonoscopy may outweight the benefit.
Ultimately patient to go for colonoscopy as outpatient especially given below.
AFIB: Pt had episode of rapid afib on [**2-18**], which was treated with iv lopressor, unsuccessfully and ultimately requiring diltiazem gtt to return to sinus bradycardia.
Hypotension: Pt was hypotensive on admission and started on DA gtt which was switched to levophed.
Pt weaned off dopamine but still unable to be started on bb and ACEI due to hypotension.
ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL: On transfer, patient required benzodiazepine gtt for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and it was noted that patient became intermittently tachycardic (while still intubated) when versed gtt was tapered.
Likewise, patient became tachycardic when fentanyl was tapered, and as such both sedative medications were successfully tapered slowly over MICU course.
MENTAL STATUS: Pt was sedated with versed gtt and ativan gtt while intubated.
After removal of pain meds and BZD, dyspnea resolved, however pt remained disoriented.
Furthermore, given history of GI bleed on anticoagulation, it was felt that risk did not outweigh benefit, and patient was kept on subcutaneous heparin only.
