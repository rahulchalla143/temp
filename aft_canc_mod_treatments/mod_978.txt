Admission Date:  [**2105-2-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2105-2-25**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 633**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea on exertion, black stools  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD Colonoscopy capsule endoscopy   History of Present Illness: 88 year old female with hx of a. fib and right brachial artery embolism on dabigatran presenting with dyspnea on exertion and black stools.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p DES to LAD and OM1, [**2098**] Mild biventricular systolic/diastolic CHF (compensated) Reactive Airway Disease Hypothyroidism Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Osteoporosis Previous pneumonia Atrial Fibrillation, not anticoagulated [**1-8**] falls Bilateral rotator cuff repair Status post right hip repair [**2096**].
Cefazolin interpretative criteria are based on a dosage regimen of          2g every 8h.
Together with the also newly occurred retrocardiac atelectasis and the moderate cardiomegaly, overall moderate pulmonary edema is present.
There is only mild retrocardiac atelectasis on today's image.
The preexisting cardiomegaly with slightly enlarged pulmonary arteries and increased diameter of the peripheral pulmonary vessels, indicative of mild-to-moderate fluid overload, is unchanged.
Colonoscopy [**2-19**]: Impression: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon Polyps in the rectum Polyp in the 25 cm (sigmoid colon) No sources of active bleeding was noted on this exam.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 88 F with history of afib on dabigatran admitted to hospital for GI bleed, transfered to MICU for hypoxemia in setting of sedation for EGD/colonoscopy, found to have increased pulmonary edema and diuresed with lasix.
# Hypoxemia/acute diastolic heart failure- Pt reportedly de-saturated to 85% on RA shortly after getting fentanyl 50 and versed 1.5mg prior to planned EGD/colonoscopy, also had report of breathing "slowly" during this episode.
Differential included medication induced hypoventilation leading to hypoxemia, though acute on chronic CHF in setting of aggressive volume resuscitation with multiple units of RBCs resulting in acute pulmonary edema is also possible.
Patient given lasix in the MICU with good urine output.
Her repeat CXR showed improved pulmonary congestion, and patient was continued on diuretic therapy.
Pt was transferred to the general medical floor and was given a few days of 10mg IV lasix therapy.
She was then transitioned to her home dose of torsemide 20mg daily.
She did well on this therapy and was on room air without any pulmonary symptoms.
EGD showed no active bleeding or obvious source for bleeding, though it did show some gastritis and pt was started on PPI therapy.
Repeat capsule was placed endoscopically and preliminary read does not show any mass or evidence of bleeding.
Beta blocker and anticoagulation were initially held in the setting of bleeding.
However, IV heparin transition to dabigatran was performed without any evidence of GI bleeding or hemodynamic instability.
She was discharged on senna and colace.
Pt received 4 units of PRBCs during admission, last transfused on [**2-18**].
Usually rate controlled with atenolol, started on anticoagulation with dabigatran after right brachial artery embolism.
The dabigatran was held during this hospitalization.
She was monitored on telemetry for RVR while holding atenolol, but her digoxin was continued.
Discussion with GI and patient's outpatient cardiologist was held re: plan for future anticoagulation and rate control and patient was transitioned back to dabigatran via IV heparin after it was certain that there was no further evidence of GI bleeding or hemodynamic instability.
Cardiology recommended an off label dosing of dabigatran 75mg TID, to potentially decrease her risk of further bleeding.
Thrombocytopenia was monitored especially while patient was receiving heparin therapy and remained relatively stable.
Pt was given cefpodoxime for a 7 day course.
LENI negative, pt receiving anticoagulation as above.
# HTN: Atenolol was  restarted after colonoscopy at lower dose of 25mg daily, which was also her discharge dose.
Pt is also taking torsemide 20mg daily as above.
#CAD-betablocker decreased to 25mg daily, continued simvastatin at 40mg daily.
However, she has been receiving this dose for quite some time without any issues.
Pt continued on dabigatran as well.
Transitional care: -monitor CBC daily for now while at rehab to determine stability of HCT/platelet count -consider outpatient evaluation of thrombocytopenia -continued monitoring of diastolic heart failure and titration of torsemide prn -continued monitoring for GIB and discussion of best anticoagulation choice  Medications on Admission: ATENOLOL - 100 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE [PRADAXA] - (Prescribed by Other Provider:  [**Doctor Last Name 171**]) - 150 mg Capsule - 1 Capsule(s) by mouth twice a day DIGOXIN - 125 mcg Tablet - 0.5 (One half) Tablet(s) by mouth once a day FLUTICASONE-SALMETEROL [ADVAIR DISKUS] - 500 mcg-50 mcg/Dose Disk with Device - 1 puff twice a day LEVOTHYROXINE - 100 mcg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily SIMVASTATIN - 40 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth at bedtime TORSEMIDE - (Dose adjustment - no new Rx) - 20 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day   Discharge Medications: 1. digoxin 125 mcg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO once a day.
