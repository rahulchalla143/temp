On [**2158-5-23**], liver transplant was performed under general anesthesia.
The patient was progressing well at this time and on postoperative day one the plan was to use morphine sulfate for pain as needed.
The patient was also on a Foley catheter to follow urine output closely.
Infectious Disease:  The patient was placed on Unasyn times three days.
The patient was also transfused platelets, fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate at this time and the patient began the immunosuppressive regimen with Solu-Medrol at 140 twice a day, CellCept 1 gram twice a day, ________ times one intraoperatively and, in terms of endocrine, patient was placed on a regular insulin sliding scale at this time with a plan to move to an insulin drip if glucose levels trended upwards.
The patient continued to progress well during his stay and continued to oxygenate well and was able to be weaned off of oxygen, FiO2 as he was weaned off of propofol at this time.
Prophylactic medications, Bactrim and fluconazole, were continued at this time.
The patient did not need a beta blocker at this time.

The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition and Unasyn was discontinued at this time.

Patient receiving CPAP and his total bilirubin and other liver function tests including ALT and AST continued to trend downward.
The patient was continued on Lasix diuresis and continued on prophylactic Bactrim, fluconazole and ganciclovir.
The patient at this time was on an insulin drip.
They recommended titrating insulin drip as needed and set up a TPN to regiment with a goal of 2,150 kilocalories per day.

On [**2158-5-31**], it was noted they found the patient to be alert and oriented but mildly inappropriate with tangential speech.
He was tolerating being out-of-bed well but that he would require short term rehabilitation upon discharge to maximize functional status.
They recommended one to three more weeks of physical therapy or until discharge to rehabilitation.
The [**Last Name (un) **] attending noted that the patient was now transitioning to eating meals and suggested starting Lentes and Humalog regimen.
As per their request after they reviewed the chart they noted that his prior regimen was likely suboptimal and that his insulin needs would be significantly different after this liver transplantation due to the effects of steroids and his new liver and they began to discuss outpatient regimens for the patient.
The patient was also receiving Occupational Therapy evaluations and it was noted on [**2158-6-1**], by Occupational Therapy that patient was minimally confused and that he would likely need rehabilitation prior to returning home.
Ancef 1 gram every eight hours was started at this time and a full HUS workup was commenced and Hematology was consulted.
He continued to be followed by [**Last Name (un) **] for glucose levels and was continued on Ancef at this time.
The patient continued to be followed by Nutrition, Respiratory Care and his liver function tests continued to trend downwards.
[**Last Name (un) **] continued to follow the patient at this time and recommended that the patient continue with current Lentes and Humalog sliding scale regimen.
He was still passing gas and having bowel movements and taking solid foods at this time.
At this time Psychiatry recommended that lithium be held and Haldol be used as needed for agitation.
At this time it was noted that the patient was not taking enough food orally and a feeding tube was placed by Interventional Radiology.
Then on the morning of [**2158-6-7**], the patient went on to pull the feeding tube from its position and it was determined that total parenteral nutrition would be delivered through a PICC line placed on the [**2158-6-6**].
The patient continued to improve at this time and was followed again by Psychiatry who suggested 1 mg dose of Haldol for standing order at night and their formal consultation was noted in the chart.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post orthotopic liver transplant [**2158-5-22**], for hepatitis B/alcoholic cirrhosis.
Hepatocellular carcinoma status post radiofrequency ablation [**2157-11-7**].
