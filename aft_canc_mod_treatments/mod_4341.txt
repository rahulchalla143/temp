There are pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymphatic nodes, including right paratracheal and left paratracheal, that are not overtly changed from previous examination by size criteria.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a charming 85 year old gentleman with CAD s/p CABG, COPD on home O2, and NSCLC who was admitted for elective heart catheterization, found to have patent grafts, AS, and elevated LVEDP.
He received three bare metal stents to his RCA and was discharged home.
He returned the same evening of discharge with fever, chest tightness, SOB, and hypoxia.
1) Hypoxia On admission CXR, patient appeared to be volume overloaded; given lasix in ED and his hypoxia improved with continued diuresis.
Elevated LVEDP in cath lab the day prior supports this diagnosis (although could be [**2-8**] pulm htn and AS) and patient received 2L IVF in the prior two days for catheterization.
- Pulmonary consultation was obtained and formulated a likely multifactorial etiology, but could not rule out radiation pneumonitis s/p XRT and possibley cardiac catheterization as a possible etiology.
Aspiration pneumonitis surrounding cardiac cath was also considered - Lasix diuresis improved oxygenzation - Prednisone was started, but later discontinued per pulmonary given lack of clear benefit in pneumonitis and possibility that it may worsen pt's fluid balance.
- BiPAP at night improved oxygenation.
Patient was treated with Levofloxacin/Flagyl for possible aspiration vs. post-obstructive pneumonia.
3) [**Name (NI) **] Pt was s/p stent to RCA the evening of re-admission.
- Pt was continued on ASA, Plavix - He was titrated on metoprolol for rate control - We continued Isosorbide Dinitrate.
Anticoagulation was not pursued given prognosis of pt's co-morbidities risks of life threatening bleeding.
- rate controlled with metoprolol - continued ASA and Clopidogrel  5) Non Small Cell Lung Cancer: Repeat PET CT scan from [**2154-1-7**] revealed evidence for progression of disease s/p XRT.
Inpatient hematology oncology consultation was obtained and did not recommend a role for chemotherapy given the patient's multiple co-morbidities that would preclude adequate dosing of chemotherapy to derive survival benefit.
