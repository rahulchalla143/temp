Patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital in late [**Month (only) **] with right knee septic arthritis following a right total knee replacement, cultures grew Group B Strep.
Hardware was removed at [**Hospital 1562**] hospital on [**2184-12-17**], replaced by antibiotic spacer.
After being re-admitted to [**Hospital 1562**] hospital, she was initially treated with BiPAP and nebulizers, with good effect.
IV fluids were given for hypotension and tachycardia.
She had a second episode of respiratory distress, and was transferred to the ICU for further management.
She then underwent diuresis, and was placed on BiPAP.
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed on [**2185-1-4**] for hemodynamic monitoring in the setting of possible cardiogenic shock.
She was then started on levofloxacin and clindamycin for aspiration pneumonia, and was transitioned to vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole.
She also received pulse dose methylprednisolone for possible COPD exacerbation.
Over past few days, vent wean has been complicated by low minute ventilation and airway secretions.
A bleeding lesion was injected with epinephrine and iced saline, with hemostasis.
Patient was then transferred via [**Location (un) 7622**] directly to ICU for further management.
Upon arrival to the ICU, patient was intubated, alert, on minimial sedation.

Nuclear Imaging Status Post Persantine Stress Test [**2185-1-12**] The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue, breast, and left arm attenuation.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a predominantly fixed, moderate reduction in photon counts involving the entire inferior wall, and the mid and basal inferolateral walls.
UCX- yeast BCX- negative x2   Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 68990**] is a 78 yo female with a PMH significant for CAD s/p PCI, HTN, HLD, COPD, recent right knee replacement complicated by septic joint, bilateral DVT s/p IVC filter transferred from OSH for management of hemoptysis and respiratory failure.
No diagnostic or therapeutic intervention performed by IP.
Went to IP procedure lab, but IP decided she was too high risk given recent cardiac pathology (see below).
Given her stable HCT and no further hemoptysis since transfer from OSH, suggested starting systemic anticoagulation with a heparin gtt and following up with rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia if repeat bleeding were to occur.
She will need a repeat bronchoscopy with biopsy in one month (when her cardiac issues have stabilized).
THe patient was given contact information of the interventional pulmonology suite at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 17398**] as well as [**Hospital1 1388**] main line at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**] with the IP fellows pager number at [**Numeric Identifier 88156**] in the event she has not been contact[**Name (NI) **] within 3 weeks of discharge.
Dobutamine was weaned upon arrival without difficulty.
Upon transfer to the floors, did not require further diuresis as physical exam was nt consistent with HF, no sob.
Given depressed EF, will need follow up evaluation by cardiology to assess the need for pacemaker placement once HF class can be determined with activity.
No further thoracic imaging was done to look for PE as patient was to receive systemic anticoagulation regardless for B/L DVT's.
Cardiology was consulted, but anticoagulation (plavix and heparin gtt) was held due to hemoptysis due to risk of bleeding.
She was treated with ASA 325 mg daily and started on a statin and metoprolol.
Had pharmacologic stress test with persantine followed by MIBI.
Given irreversibility, cath not indiciated and Plavix not indciated given the duration post NSTEMI.
Continued to medically manage NSTEMI with ASA, metoprolol, lisinopril, and high dose atorvastatin without issue.
Placed back on home fenofibrate upon discharge (not given as non-formulary in house).
# Bilateral DVT:  Patient had an IVC filter placed at an OSH in mid-[**Month (only) 1096**] per her son.
Systemic anti-coagulation was held as above in setting of hemoptysis, however she was given SC heparin as prophylaxis.
After acute hemorrhaging was ruled out (per above) was started on heparin gtt.
HCT stable on heparin gtt and tranisitioned to enoxaparin 90 mg [**Hospital1 **] for at least 3 months of treatment (started anticoagulation [**2185-1-11**]) given provoked development of DVTs in the setting of orthopedic surgery and lack of mobility.
# Septic right knee s/p hardware removal:  X-ray of knee showed hardware (cement spacers) in place.
She was continued on ceftriaxone 2 grams IV daily, with day one of Abx treatment being [**2185-1-4**].
Will need at 28 days worth of antibiotics with ortho f/u for hardware replacement once infection has been deemed cleared.
Discharged on pain control with 5 mg oxycodone q4 hours PRN and oxycontin 10 mg [**Hospital1 **].
CHRONIC ISSUES # DM: continued SSI regimen w/o issue.
# GERD: disconitnued home PPI as past duration of therapy for GERD.
# COPD: Continued albuterol/ipratropium nebs prn without issue.
will need to continue on contact precautions.

You were originally transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for management of multiple medical issues outlined below.
You were evaluated by cardiologists here that placed you on medication to optimize your cardiac function (outlined below).
During your stay, you had a "Pharmacologic Stress Test" with a medication known as "Persantine" which mimics an exercise stress test.
Thus, you should continue to take your cardiac medication as prescribed to decrease the risk of having another cardiac event in the future.
You had your knee replacement hardware removed, and cement "spacers" were placed between the bones of your leg for stability.
You will need to continue antibiotic treatment for at least four weeks, with follow up with your orthopedic surgeon Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to decide when would be the best time for you to have your knee replacement performed again.
You have started many new medications, and some of your home medications have been changed.
Please continue to take your medications as directed: Ipratropium Bromide MDI 2 PUFFs inhaled every 6 hours (for COPD)  Albuterol Inhaler 2 PUFF inhaled every 6 hours as needed for shortness of breath Lisinopril 2.5 mg orally daily- new cardiac medication (controls blood pressure, helps heart muscle) Furosemide 20 mg orally daily (for fluid retention/heart failure) Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg by mouth 2x a day- (cardiac medication: controls heart rate/blood pressure) Aspirin 325 mg DAILY Zetia 10 mg daily (for cholesterol) Atorvastatin 80 mg DAILY (cardiac medication- controls cholesterol and improves heart function/reduces risk of recurrent heart attack)   CeftriaXONE 2 gm IV daily (IV antibiotic for septic arthritis)OxycoDONE (Immediate Release)  5 mg every 3 hours as needed for pain Oxycontin 10 mg 2x a day- long acting pain medication for basal pain control Enoxaparin Sodium 90 mg injections 2x a day (for blood clots in legs) Insulin Sliding Scale- for glucose control .
We have discontinued your Prilosec 20 mg daily (Aka Omeprazole), a medication typically used for gastric reflux.
The duration of being on this medication was longer than the usual therepeutic course.
Given your episodes of hemoptysis (coughing up blood), you will need to follow up with interventional pulmonology for a repeat bronchoscopy to image your airway.
Please contact him at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 88160**] at your convenience regarding the status of your knee and when further interventions can be performed to replace your knee.
