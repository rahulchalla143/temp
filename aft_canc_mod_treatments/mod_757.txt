Her Keprra dose was increased from 500mg [**Hospital1 **] to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **], which was eventually changed to 1000mg TID.
She underwent MR Spectroscopy on [**5-15**] which showed "Interval progression in the pattern of enhancement at the right temporal frontoparietal lesion with avid perfusion and increased signal on the corresponding ASL sequence, concerning for tumor progression, there is also mild increase in vasogenic edema extending at the external capsule".
Thus, on [**5-19**], patient underwent craniotomy for tumor resection.
She tolerated the procedure well and was extubated without incident.
She was transferred to SICU for further management and frequent neuro checks.
She was discharged to home on [**5-21**] on a Decadron taper.
