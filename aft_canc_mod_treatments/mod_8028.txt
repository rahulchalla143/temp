Admission Date:  [**2120-7-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2120-8-21**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old female who was admitted on [**7-22**] for resection of a left lower lobe adenocarcinoma.
She was admitted for surgery on [**7-22**].
There was a left lower lobe resection done with pathology that showed adenocarcinoma.
She was extubated after surgery and then on [**7-25**] she went into atrial fibrillation and her blood pressure dropped to the 90's and she had shortness of breath.
She was given Pronestyl, Lopressor, Lasix and she was diuresed with 500 cc, eventually converted back to sinus rhythm.
She again became short of breath on [**7-26**], diagnosed with left lower lobe collapse on chest x-ray.
She was intubated and had left lower lobe thick secretions and collapse was thought to be secondary to mucus plugging.
She was briefly on Diamox and weaned to a pressure support of [**5-11**], resting in an IMV overnight.
She was started on Augmentin prophylaxis on [**7-29**] for continued secretions.
A tracheostomy was placed on [**7-31**].
Then she was slowly weaned off her ventilation.
She was put on her trach mask for 24 hours and did well but did not tolerate PMV.
A PEG was placed on [**8-10**].
She received Esmolol and Amiodarone, eventually converting to sinus rhythm.
Amiodarone was continued at 400 mg tid times one week and later changed to 400 mg [**Hospital1 **].
On [**8-15**] at 5 a.m. the patient was found cyanotic with her tracheostomy mask off and saturations from 80-85%.
She was given Lasix 20 mg IV, became unable to maintain her saturations on her trach mask.
Her hospital course was notable also for intermittent confusion but baseline orientation.
She had an AAA repair in [**2100**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1476**], notable for hypertension, atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, right hip replacement, 100 pack year history of smoking, seasonal allergies and emphysema by pathology.
ALLERGIES:  Possibly Ciprofloxacin causing confusion, dated [**11/2118**], otherwise no known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS:  On transfer to the MICU, Premarin .625 mg po q d, Amiodarone 400 mg po bid, Levaquin 500 mg po q d, subcu Heparin [**Hospital1 **], Lopressor 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], Aspirin 81 mg po q d, Multivitamin, Albuterol nebulizer and Albuterol inhaler q 4 hours, Impact with fiber 50 cc per hour, Dulcolax, Combivent.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient's vital signs on transfer to the MICU, temperature 98.6, pulse 67-99, blood pressure 88/40 to 100/44, ins and outs, positive 250 cc, ventilator SIMV 450 times 8, 7.5 and 50% O2, pressure support 15, total volume 290, saturation 98%.
Pulmonary, diminished sounds at bases, anterior bronchial breath sounds on left.
ASSESSMENT & PLAN:  This is an 85-year-old status post left lower lobe lobectomy for adenocarcinoma.
The patient now has a tracheostomy and a PEG tube status post an episode of respiratory distress on the floor, likely secondary to decreased FIO2, rapid atrial fibrillation with elevated white blood cells and infiltrate on chest x-ray.
Pulmonary:  Pneumonia, given multiple infiltrates on the chest x-ray and elevated white blood cell count, treating aggressively for gram negative and will double cover with Levaquin and Ceftaz.
One dose of Levaquin already given in the a.m.
Would likely keep the patient slightly dry as tolerated by blood pressure, ventilation, continue to wean as tolerated and change pressure support as tolerated.
She is on Lopressor for blood pressure and rate control.
If continues on Amiodarone would consider reconsulting and more invasive measures.
Nutrition:  We are giving her tube feeds via her PEG tube.
Heme/Onc:  The patient is anticoagulated on Aspirin and Coumadin will be started.
The patient has an A line and a PEG tube and we would favor placing a PICC line for long-term weaning and antibiotics.
Prophylaxis, patient is on tube feeds and subcu Heparin.
The patient was placed on Clindamycin 600 mg IV, she is now on day #4 and is on Levaquin 500 mg each day, she is on day #6.
The patient will be discharged with a prescription for a total of 14 days of both antibiotics for her suspected pneumonia.
The patient was able to off the ventilator for 8 hours yesterday and just be on the trach mask.
The patient is currently on pressure support of 10 and PEEP of 5, total volume in the 300's on an FIO2 of 40%.
The patient was put back on ventilator overnight.
She had a brief episode of hypotension which responded to 250 cc of normal saline bolus.
The patient continues on the Amiodarone for history of atrial fibrillation.
The patient was seen by interventional radiology to have a PICC line placed for long-term IV antibiotics.
The patient was placed on Coumadin for her atrial fibrillation.
Coumadin will be increased on discharge to 7.5 with instructions to check the INR and dose appropriately.
The patient will continue with tube feeds through her PEG tube.
The patient's subcu Heparin will continue until patient is appropriately out of bed, able to get out of bed a couple of times a day.
The patient remains on Clindamycin and Levofloxacin.
The patient will continue her tube feeds through her PEG tube.
The patient will continue on the Amiodarone.
