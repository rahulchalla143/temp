His ROS is significant for reporting no bowel movements or urination for 1-2 days.
Team was concerned for spinal cord compression, but could not get MRI as pt has surgical clips after traumatic head injury.
On POD#2, pt became acute dyspneic and hypoxic to 77% after nasotracheal suctioning.
On arrival to MICU, Sats ranged from 85-95% on NRB + 6L NC; briefly placed on BiPAP, but oxygenation actually decreased with this.

There is but no right ventricular diastolic collapse with relatively minimal fluid anterior to the right ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: 51 yo man with esophageal cancer s/p chemo and XRT presenting with abrupt onset lower extremity flacid paralysis found to have T4 epidural abscess, s/p operative debridement, now with acute onset respiratory distress .
This was discussed at length with the patient, and he wishes to continue chest PT and other non-invasive measures to augment his cough and support his breathing.
- supplemental O2 as needed to keep SpO2>90%, currently requiring Hi Flow venti mask; titrate up to non rebreather if needed - DNR/DNI; if noninvasive means to support oxygenation are ineffective, pt would want to transition to hospice .
# Pericardial effusion: given cardiomediastinal enlargement on CXR, stat echo was obtained, which showed moderate pericardial effusion with invagination of RA, equivocal respiratory variation of RV movement, but no collapse of RV.
# T4 epidural abscess: s/p open debridement on [**7-16**], wound cultures growing Strep milleri, but wound GM stain also showed a GM Neg coccobacillus, suspect mouth flora.
Ceftriaxone 2gm Q24H for once-daily dosing regimen to cover Strep milleri, and metronidazole 500mg tid for anaerobes.
Will plan to continue course for 6 weeks given serious CNS infection.
After 6 week course is complete, recommend suppressive therapy with amoxicillin 500mg daily indefinitely, as the locally advanced esophageal cancer will remain a risk for thoracic spine infection.
# Esophageal CA: s/p chemo and xrt, with stenting for stenosis.
Patient's goals for treatment have been to be able to eat; oncologist Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] has indicated that further chemo or xrt will likely not help in this regard but continue to follow.
# Tobacco Dependance: nicotine patch .
# Prophylaxis: -heparing subcutaneous, pneumoboots, and protonix .
