Patient was started on moxifloxacin for presumed pneumonia, but chest xray and cultures (unclear if blood or sputum) were negative, so antibiotics were stopped after 4 days.
A colonoscopy was performed several years ago and was normal.
Patient tolerated platelets well but while getting blood transfusion developed rigors, tachypnea and afib with RVR to the 160s.
Patient received Solumedrol 125 mg IVx1, Tylenol 1 g po x1, Benadryl 50 mg IVx1, and Demerol 12.5 mg IVx1.
ABG on 100% NRB was 7.26/29/59/14, so intubation was pursued.
Patient received etomidate 20 mg and succinylcholine 120 mg.
Patient was given vancomycin and zosyn.
Review of systems: limited due to patient being intubated and sedated.
Atrial Fibrillation: rate controlled, off anticoagulation since [**11-22**] 3.

Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 68 yo M with a h/o lymphoma s/p auto-BMT in [**2176**], Afib (off anticoagulation) and PVD who was admitted for subacute dyspnea on exertion and generalized weakness, hypotension and acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and found to have diagnosis of HLH, expired during this admission after being transferred to ICU.
Broad antibiotic coverage was started with linezolid/meropenem/vancomycin, as well as voriconazole (for presumed aspergillus) and acyclovir (for herpetic appearing lesions) and he was started on pressors.
Skin lesions on buttocks were biopsied by dermatology service and found to be growing [**Last Name (LF) 23087**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] fungal coverage was changed to micafungin, bronch was done and showed no e/o PCP but patient was started on prophylactic dose of bactrim daily.
Patient continued to be hypotensive and was supported with fluids, albumin and IVF, and HLH was treated agressively with high dose IV steroids, as well as Alemtuzumab.
ICU course was also complicated by acute renal failure, which improved with IVF so likely pre-renal.
He also was noted to have afib with RVR and was started on a diltiazem drip when BP tolerated, however he was often hypotensive.
He was also on a lasix gtt for fluid overload given frequent IVF boluses and signficant anasarca, along with pressors for improved diuresis, however BP was often low as above.
Initially thought to be [**2-20**] medication effect as he was on voriconazole, however even after stopping remained elevated, RUQ u/s showed no portal vein thrombosis, most likely elevation in liver enzymes due to HLH.
Patient was treated aggressively until family decided to focus on comfort measures.
Initially on broad spectrum Abx for HCAP given recent admission although Vanco/Cipro peeled back after a couple days when less likely PNA.
Supported with fluids and initially with pressors.
BP slowly improved over the next few days with these therapies and pt was stable on at home blood pressures at time of discharge to floor.
Pt initialy started on Vanco/Cipro which was D/ced when sputum grew respiratory flora.
This second Cr bump resolved over the next couple of days and Cr returned to baseline, however ICU course was complicated by renal failure, likely pre-renal, improved with IVF  # Afib: Rate controlled after intubation although had been in RVR.
Pt was continued on home digoxin with levels in appropriate level.
Cardiology was consulted and felt that VT could be an early sign of digoxin toxicity.
Digoxin was discontinued and metoprolol was uptitrated.
His metoprolol was uptitrated to 75 TID and his digoxin was added back.
He was also started on Diltiazem 30 four times a day.
After transfer to the ICU for respiratory failure, he was placed on a diltiazem drip when BP tolerated for frequent episodes of RVR, see above for details.
Also started on steroids and then cyclosporine.
Cyclosporine was discontinued on [**2182-5-12**] since pt's ferritin levels were elevated and his smear showed histiocytes with engulfed RBC.
On [**5-17**] and [**5-18**] he was started on basiliximab, and later in ICU received Alemtuzumab as well as high dose steroids.
He was diuresed with lasix gtt while in the ICU as pressures tolerated, however he was often hypotensive and unable to tolerate.
Chemotherapy was initiated (etoposide dose was initially reduced when bilirubin was high) and liver enzymes normalized subsequently.
Liver enzymes started to trend upwards again when voriconazole was started for presumed aspergillosis infection, and after voriconazole was stopped they continued to uptrend, repeat RUQ u/s showed no portal vein thrombosis.
