A CT scan of the abdomen was negative and he was started on vancomycin and cefepime.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he was switched to Daptomycin from Vanco due to his history of VRE and also started on empiric C. Diff treatment with PO Vanco and IV Flagyl as well as continued on his Fusarium treatment.
On [**7-30**] Daptomycin was also discontinued.
He was started on decitabine on [**7-30**].
Past Medical History: Past Oncologist History: Biphenotypic Leukemia - Initially prsented with "autoimmune pancytopenia" treated with steroids and IVIG.
Preliminary bone marrow biopsy was suspicious for a biphenotypic leukemia and therapy was initiated with hyperCVAD.
His day 14 marrow showed persistent disease and his regimen was changed to 7+3.
Further chemotherapy was held as he was found to have disseminated fusarium infection in the setting of prolonged neutropenia.
He was ultimately discharged on G-CSF and daily Ambisome.
Other PMH: Disseminated Fusarium - [**5-14**] - treated with Ambisome and Voriconazole h/o hepatitis B - on lamivudine s/p appendectomy s/p umbilical hernia repair  Social History: Currently on disability.

Repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis is recommended to assess for underlying infection.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the septum and mid-distal inferior/infero-lateral walls.
Bilateral, moderate on the right and small to moderate on the left pleural effusions, associated with bibasal consolidations that potentially might represent atelectasis, although infection cannot be entirely excluded.
Opacification at the right base medially most likely represents crowding of residually dilated pulmonary vessels.
He was treated with cefepime and daptomycin (for hx of VRE) as well as ambisome for fursarium.
Daptomycin was discontinued when the patient was afebrile and transferred out of the ICU.
At time of discharge, he remained neutropenic and is expected to remain neutropenic for several days from decitabine treatment.
He was discharged on levofloxacin and ambisome.
Patient was double covered with ambisome and voriconazole in ICU, but voriconazole was discontinued while on decitabine because it suppresses cell lines.
He was continued on Ambisome 800 mg IV Q24H throughout hospital course and prescribed to restart voriconazle when patient 72hrs post-chemotherapy.
Abdominal pain resolved by its own on Day 5 if decitabine and remained stable until discharge.
He did not complain of chest pain, SOB, or show any hemodynamic instability for his hospital stay.
The patient was fluid overloaded secondary to CHF (EF 45%), 1L NS boluses around ambisome infusions and later on, volume associated with chemotherapy.
Originally upon transfer to the floor, diuresis was held secondary to fear of lowering preload in the setting of pericardial effusion, but once this was deemed stable stable, patient was diuresed on 3 consecutive days with 20 IV lasix, and then remained euvolemic throughout the remainder of hospitalization.
He was continued on lamivudine throughout hospitalization.
Transitional Issues: The patient is set up to come to [**Hospital1 18**] oncology outpatient on a daily basis to get his ambisome infusions, labwork, and prn platelet and RBC transfusions.

You were initially in the intensive care unit, where your fever resolved, and a fluid collection around your heart was monitored.
Because the fluid collection around your heart appeared stable, you were transferred to the hematology/oncology floor, where you were given a 10 day course Decitabine chemotherapy for your chemotherapy.
You were discharged at the end of your chemotherapy to follow-up as an outpatient.
This medication was held while you were on chemotherapy; please do not take it before this date.
- Please begin taking levofloxacin 500mg daily until you are told to stop.
- You were not given neupogen on discharge today because that should start 24 hrs after your last chemotherapy, so you should receive it tomorrow when you visit for your nursing appointment.
