She was started on oral ciprofloxacin for her hx of UTIs with bacteuria, despite a U/A showing > 10 epis in addition to bacteria (but only 0-2 WBCs) and neg leukocyte esterase.
The neurology consult recommended that the pt be started on IV acyclovir and IV keppra as well as ceftriaxone and vancomycin and an MRI.
(But while they were finalizing their recs, we were contact[**Name (NI) **] for possible transfer, and also recommended the above interventions in addition to an LP).
Her SBPs at this time were running in the mid-80's, but she was not given fluids at that time.
After discussion with the attending and the ID physician on call it was determined that an LP at that site was contraindicated given that we may introduce VZV into the CSF if it isn't there already, and she's already on the appropriate meds.

This is apparent of nonspecific etiology and can be seen in the hypoxic ischemic setting, or alternatively could be related to effects of sedative medications such as long-acting benzodiazepines.
This is a pattern of nonspecific etiology, which is seen in hypoxic ischemic setting, and can alternatively be present with sedative medication such as long acting benzodiazepines.
Grade 1 anterolisthesis identified at L4 upon L5 level, causing moderate-to-severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing and spinal canal narrowing.
This activity subsides and a burst suppression pattern appears with medication administration in the later part of the recording.
Compared to the prior day's recording, there are more frequent clinical movements with rhythmic activity concerning for seizures which subside in the later part of the recording with medication administration.
The rest of the record showed a burst suppression pattern consistent with medication effect.
Compared to the prior day's recording, there are numerous electrographic and clinical seizures captured in this recording during the early morning period of time when patient was off propofol and one seizure later in the day on propofol.
The rest of the record showed a burst suppression pattern consistent with medication effect.

Compared to the prior day's recording, there were very frequent and, at times, prolonged clinical and electrographic seizures which change to a burst suppression pattern with administration of Ativan and propofol.

EEG [**2108-4-18**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal short continuous ICU monitoring study which is limited because of electrode artifact.
Unfortunately, her course has been c/b intermittent clonic seizures which are associated with a poor prognosis and associated possible brain damage.
She was treated with IV Acyclovir for her entire hospital course.
She unfortunately developed frequency clonic seizures that were refractory to multiple anticonvulsants until a propofol infusion was started.
The patient's CSF infection was treated with IV Acyclovir for the entire hospital course with an intent to recheck the CSF VZV PCR for possible clearance of the virus as suggested by Infectious Diseases.
She was monitored on continuous EEG.
She was treated with Fosphenytoin (with levels monitored, up to 150 mg TID), Levetiracetam (up to 2000mg [**Hospital1 **]), Lacosamide (300 mg [**Hospital1 **]), Lorazepam (1 q2h), and propofol.
When propofol was weaned, the seizures recurred in high frequency.
She was maintained on phenylephrine which was gradually weaned off.
[] Pneumonia - She had a tracheostomy placed but subsequently developed ventilator-associated pneumonia which was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics (tobramycin, vancomycin, cefepime).
[] Transaminitis - She was noted to have increasing LFTs after valproate was tried, so this medication was stopped.
[] Goals of Care - After maximal therapy for almost four weeks, the HCP [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 94141**] and the rest of the family decided to withdraw care after the attempt to wean levetiracetam and lorazepam.
