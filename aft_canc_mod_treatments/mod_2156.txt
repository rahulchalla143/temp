FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history is significant for the patient's aunt dying at age 80 of coronary artery disease.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2143-10-28**] and underwent a Bental procedure with homograft.
Therefore, she underwent an emergent saphenous vein graft harvest from the right lower extremity for emergent coronary artery bypass grafting from the homograft site to the distal right coronary system.
Postoperatively, the patient remained intubated and was care for in the CSRU.
She remained intubated and sedated.
They attempted to wean her dobutamine on postoperative day number one as well as attempting to discontinue her Lidocaine drip.
Once she was extubated, the patient was started on aspirin, Lopressor and Lasix as well as having her diet advanced to a cardiac diet.
She therefore had her Swan-Ganz catheter removed and was deemed appropriate for discharge to the floor.
The patient was continued on Ancef during the perioperative period for groin drainage from the right and left groin sites.
She had been maintained on an intra-aortic balloon pump postoperatively and the wound where they had inserted the balloon pump did have a serous effluent, thought possibly secondary to a lymphatic leak.
She was receiving aggressive pulmonary toilette.
Her chest tubes were removed and her laboratory data at that time showed a hematocrit of 27, that was stable from the previous day of 27.
After repleting electrolytes as needed and receiving aggressive physical therapy and rehabilitation screening, and pulmonary toilette from the respiratory therapists, the patient's clinical course steadily improved.
Given this, she was continued on aggressive diuresis with Lasix and given incentive spirometry, coughing and deep breathing training as well as ambulation three times a day to four times a day, with maximum distances of 400 to 500 feet per trip.
The patient was reluctant to leave and, as a consequence, we allowed her to stay an additional 24 hours for continued physical therapy and pulmonary toilette.
By postoperative day number eight, patient's was off of her Ancef and was started on oral Keflex for some erythema around the staple sites at the inferior margin of her sternum.
