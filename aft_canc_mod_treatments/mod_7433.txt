Admission Date:  [**2142-6-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-6-15**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Oxycodone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension, diarrhea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Arterial line  History of Present Illness: 89 year old male with HTN, CHF (EF 40%), chronic aspiration, celiac sprue and recently diagnosed IgA nephropathy with hemodialysis initiation in [**3-12**] and subsequent transfer to a nursing home, who presents with a 2 weeks history of diarrhea, found to be hypotensive at rehab.
Of note, he had a recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**3-12**] for acute on chronic renal failure at which time he was diagnosed with IgA nephropathy and started on HD.
During this hospitalization he was diagnosed with C. Diff which was treated initially with flagyl, but later changed to PO vancomycin given concern that flagyl was contributing to mental status changes.
He completed a course of treatment at this time, extended to last 5 days after completion of concurrent antibiotics for a pneumonia.
A femoral line was attempted unsuccessfully.
He received levofloxacin and flagyl.
He was given ASA 325 mg x 1 and transferred to the MICU.
Started on HD during hospitalization in [**3-12**].
5) Celiac Sprue 6) History of aspiration pneumonia 7) History of MRSA pneumonia 8) History of Clostridium Difficile infection [**3-12**] 9) Anemia of chronic inflammation   Social History: Patient currently living in a nursing home since last admission.
He was covered empirically with broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole).
However, cultures remained negative, and he responded promptly to aggressive fluid resuscitation.
He was given IVF boluses to maintain a MAP > 55.
Flagyl was changed to vanco po for tx of C diff.
He was started on empiric metronidazole on admission and stool samples sent for C Diff toxin assay.
His diarrhea improved somewhat with empiric metronidazole therapy, but continued to persist.
Oral vancomycin was added for coverage of metronidazole resistant C Diff, with prompt response and near resolution of his diarrhea.
Troponin was chronically elevated and unreliable in setting of end stage renal disease, with a normal CK.
His outpatient regimen of low dose metoprolol was resumed prior to discharge.
6) IgA nephropathy/ESRD:  Dialysis was held for a number of days after admission as his electrolytes continued to remain within normal limits and he was not fluid overloaded even after aggressive fluid resuscitation.
He was continued on epogen 5000 units QHD and nephrocaps.
7) CHF: He had a history of biventricular heart failure, both systolic and diastolic, therefore fluids were given judiciously initially.
8) Mixed Respiratory and Metabolic acidosis:  He initially had what appeared to be an acute respiratory acidosis based on ABG, with additional metabolic AG acidosis (AG at 16, and expected much lower given last albumin 2.2), in part secondary to lactic acidosis, possibly also contribution of unmeasured anions in renal failure.
His metabolic acidosis resolved with treatment of his sepsis and decrease in his lactate.
10) Chronic tophaceous gout:  Continued on allopurinol.
His thrombocytopenia was felt secondary to medications (though unclear which ones), and nadired at 51.
He was severely hemoconcentrated on admission with a hematocrit > 40, dropping to 30 the following day after aggressive IVF hydration.
15) FEN:  He was advanced to a pureed, gluten free diet with thickened liquids once clinically stable.
