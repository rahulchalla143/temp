CXR revealed a RML opacity and she was given combivent nebs and solumedrol 125 mg IV x1.
At this time, her mental status apparently improved but she was intubated for her respiratory distress.
She placed on Bipap during the interim, and eventually intubated.
Post intubation ABG was 7.21/37/75/16.
Saturations remained in the high 80s despite FiO2 100%, so patient was given 20 mg IV lasix and PEEP was increased from 10 to 15.

She cleared her subsequent blood cultures with appropriate antibiotic treatment.
The patient was initially treated with meropenem, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin, narrowed to just ciprofloxacin on [**2205-6-22**] when the patient's urine grew pan-sensitive Klebsiella.
Ciprofloxacin was changed to ceftriaxone on [**2205-6-26**] due to concerns that cipro might be contributing to agitation.
Vancomycin and meropenem were briefly added back due to hypothermia and hypotension, but they were again stopped on [**2205-6-24**].
The patient was briefly treated with micafungin from [**2205-6-22**] to [**2205-6-25**].

She should be maintained on CPAP at night.
She is blind in the eye and was continued on her home eye drop regimen including atropine, latanoprost, combigan, and artficial tears eye drops.
