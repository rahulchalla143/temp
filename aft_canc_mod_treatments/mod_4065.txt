Patient's history dates back to when she was initially admitted to [**Hospital 11485**] Med Center [**2154-11-6**] after reaction to antibiotics and required mechanical ventilation.
She was brought to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital [**2154-12-19**] for intermittent hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension due to tracheal obstruction by trach tube with positional changes.
While at [**Hospital1 8**] she was tried on [**Last Name (un) 295**] 6.5 and Shiley 6.0, but these resulted in air leakage and subjective distress.
Hospital course was complicated by MRSA pneumonia, treated with 14days combination Vancomycin and Linezolid.
She was also treated for E.coli UTI and Staph epi bacteremia.
At [**Hospital1 18**] she underwent bedside bronchoscopy and trach change with placement of an adjustment 11.5cm [**Last Name (un) 295**] was placed.
Hospital course then was complicated by hypotension after attept to increase diltiazem dose from 15 to 30mg, and recurrent trach obstruction requiring repeat bronchoscopy.
She was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] today after oxygen desaturations with positional change and inability to bag.
She received doses of vancomycin and cefepime in the ED for pneumonia given h/o MRSA and pseudomonas.

Tracheostomy tube noted.
85 yo female with h/o mets, thyroid cancer s/p tracheostomy c/b tracheomalacia, with recent treatment for pneumonia and CHF, transferred here with hypoxia.
The patient was initially also on vancomycin, but this was discontinued as there was no evidence of gram + infection.
The trach tube was found to be no longer overlapping the Y-stent, and redundant airway tissue was occluding the trach.
Lasix was restarted at a low dose on [**2-3**] and then increased to her home dose to try to improve fluid status and respiratory status.
She is currently diuresing well on Lasix 80mg PO BID.
She was initially started on a heparin gtt, then transitioned to coumadin.
Heparin gtt discontinued after INR was found to be 2.0. .
# Afib - Rate controlled on diltiazem and digoxin.
The patient is on coumadin at home and was initially on a heparin gtt.
Coumadin was restarted and heparin stopped after INR found to be 2.0. .
# CHF - EF 55%, mild AS on TTE here; likely volume down on admission, so boluses of IV fluid were given for poor urine output initially.
Eventually when patient stabilized, her home lasix was restarted to attempt to improve fluid and respiratory status.
Stools guiac positive on heparin gtt, which was d/c'd, hct now stable.
Is anticoagulated with warfarin as outpatient.
Continued vitamins, Zinc, vitamin C. Wound care with duoderm.
# UC - continued mesalamine .
# Hypothyroid - continued levothyroxine .
