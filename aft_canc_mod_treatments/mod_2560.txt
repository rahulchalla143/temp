man with a history of COPD, lung cancer s/p lobectomy, MI s/p stenting, diastolic CHF who presented with R hip fracture now POD7 s/p repair who was transferred several times to the MICU for SOB/hypercarbic respiratory failure and eventually developed a high-grade small bowel obstruction for which he was eventually made comfort measures only and extubated.
Atelectasis and lobectomy may have contributed to SOB but does not explain symptoms alone.
Pt improved significantly on IV steroids, BIPAP, and nebs in the MICU.
He was weaned off of his BIPAP down to 3L NC for O2 requirement by POD2.
Solumedrol was transitioned to prednisone 40 mg PO the day following his hypercarbic respiratory failure and he was transferred to the medical floor.
On [**7-12**], given the persistent high-grade bowel obstruction for which the patient and family did not want to pursue further treatment, he was made comfort measures only and extubated terminally on [**7-12**].
Surgery recommended operative intervention however his family elected to make him comfort measures only after family meeting regarding goals of care, given his poor overall prognosis and high risk for surgery.
# Mechanical Fall/R Intertrochanteric Hip Fracture: He was transferred from an OSH overnight [**2151-7-3**] to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of his R hip fracture.
He received fixation of his R intertrochanteric hip fracture on [**2151-7-5**] (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**].
Orthopedics was following, and they recommended weight bearing of R lower extremity as tolerated, PT, Hct TID, and lovenox for 2 weeks.
His pain was well controlled with standing tylenol, lidoderm patch, oxycodone PRN, and morphine PRN severe pain.
The decision was to hold off on anticoagulation in the post-op period to determine whether this would resolve.
He was continued on metroprolol succinate XL 25mg PO daily.
His furosemide was held during the admission due to him not appearing volume overloaded on exam and intermittent Cr elevations.
His medications were renally dosed.
# Coronary artery disease: s/p MI with coronary artery stenting in the [**2129**].
His furosemide was held given that his volume exam did not reveal that he was overloaded.
He was continued on his home simvastatin and metoprolol.
His colchicine was held due to his renal issues, but his allopurinol was renally dosed.
#Hyperlipidemia: He was continued on simvastatin 20mg daily.
Medications on Admission: * Cefuroxime 500mg daily * Simvastatin 20mg daily * Tamsulosin ER 0.4mg daily * Cardizem 180mg twice daily * Proscar 5mg daily * Celebrex 200mg daily * Furosemide 20mg daily * Cardura 4mg daily * Allopurinol 300mg daily * Serevent 50mcg two puffs twice daily * Atrovent HFA 17mcg 2 puffs four times daily * Azmacort 2 puffs twice daily * Colchicine 0.6mg daily * Toprol XL 25mg daily * Levothyroxine 25mcg daily * Spiriva 18mcg daily   Discharge Medications: expired  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Right Hip Fracture  Discharge Condition: expired  Discharge Instructions: expired  Followup Instructions: expired                               [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **] MD [**MD Number(2) 2764**]  Completed by:[**2151-7-13**
