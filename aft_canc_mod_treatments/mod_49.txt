Admission Date:  [**2172-7-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-7-13**]   Service: MED  Allergies: Amoxicillin / Aspirin / Clindamycin / Erythromycin Base / Bactrim  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: confusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD  Brief Hospital Course: Respiratory failure:  The patient was intubated and maintained on pressure support ventilation from the time of admission due to respiratory failure with blood gas consistent with hypoxia.
The patient had small right pleural effusion on admission and developed left pleural effusion during her hospital stay, but these effusions were small and unlikely to contribute to respiratory distress.
The patient was maintained on pressure support ventilation during her admission and oxygenation was maintained with acceptable parameters.
This was most likely secondary to GI bleed; although, the patient's elevated white count on admission and continuous hemodynamic instability during her hospital stay despite stable hematocrit indicated that there were likely other contributing factors.
The patient was initially suspected of having sepsis, and was begun on empiric therapy with levofloxacin and Flagyl.
The patient was treated with levofloxacin and Flagyl during her entire hospital admission as empiric therapy for possible sepsis.
She displayed labile blood pressure during her entire admission and required occasional fluid boluses to maintain her mean arterial pressure greater than 60.
She required intermittent use of pressure medications during her admission with Dopamine being the principle [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
On admission, the patient was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells raising her hematocrit to 27.
The patient was also treated with Protonix IV b.i.d., sucralfate 1 gram by NG tube q.i.d., and fluid resuscitation.
The possibility of consumptive coagulopathy was most concerning in this patient with gastric carcinoma.
Fibrinogen and FDP were checked to evaluate for DIC, and were found to be within normal limits.
Pain:  The patient was treated with Fentanyl drip in order to provide adequate analgesia.
She was observed to be comfortable initially on Fentanyl drip with no signs of pain.
Eventually, the patient demonstrated physical signs of discomfort, and required Fentanyl boluses in addition to her Fentanyl drip.
Fentanyl boluses were administered as required to maintain strong level of analgesia in the patient.
They directed that the intensive care unit team should withhold laboratory tests and medications except for medications that would maintain the patient's comfort.
The patient was treated with Fentanyl drip and Fentanyl boluses to maintain analgesia and was observed to be comfortable during her hospital stay.
