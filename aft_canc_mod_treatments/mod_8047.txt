Recommended urgent surgical consult.
She had an elevated white blood cell count to 20,000 and a CT scan that showed a small bowel obstruction with internal hernia.
Risks and benefits of surgery were reviewed with the patient who was minimally responsive at this point but also with her family.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated postoperatively.
Her family wished her to be DNR/DNI after the immediate perioperative period but agreed to bronchoscopy to help to clear a presumed mucus plug.
On bronchoscopy it was noted there was a large mucus plug and that an ecotrin aspirin (which the patient had never received postoperatively) was in her right mainstem bronchus.
She was first tried on CPAP and then later on BiPAP, with ever worsening acidemia and hypercarbia.
