Paracentesis ([**2109-2-14**]): Technically successful ultrasound-guided diagnostic paracentesis Preliminary Reportwith 850 mL of clear serous fluid removed.
# AMS/Delirium: Likely toxic metabolic encephalopathy given marked improvement with antibiotics and EEG consistent with generalized encephalopathy and no e/o seizure or epileptiform activity.
After initiating appropriate antibiotic therapy for enterococcus UTI, her mental status rapidly improved.
Bacterial cultures were negative and antibiotics were narrowed and acyclovir was discontinued.
MRI was also performed at [**Hospital3 2568**] and showed periventricular [**Known lastname **] matter changes consistent with MS. On the floor her mental status rapidly improved, though she contined to wax and wane with occasional hallucinations and inappropriate responses to questioning, intersperced with periods of lucidity consistent with delerium.
# DVT: Pt with b/l DVTs, for which she was started on Heparin gtt and Warfarin.
She also had an IVC filter placed at [**Hospital3 10959**], as she needed to be reversed for urgent LP.
Warfarin and Heparin were stopped and she was placed on therapeutic doses of Loveonx.
She should be continued on Lovenox shots as prescribed for at least the next 6 months with consideration given to lifelong anticoagulation given her known hypercoagulable state.
Ultrasound guided paracentesis was performed and cells were sent for cytology.
She will follow up as an outpatient for management of her malignancy.
# Bleed: Pt's HCT dropped 28->23 s/p paracentesis in the setting of anticoagulation with Lovenox.
At [**Hospital1 18**] she was given Ceftriaxone; urine culture grew enterococcus sensitive to Ampicillin and Ceftriacxone was stopped and she was given a 7d course of Ampicillin.
Ampicillin was continued due to her recurrent UTIs and hospital admissions for AMS; she will require lifelong Ampicillin prophylaxis and should continue q6h straight cath for her neurogenic bladder.
Initial concern was for pre-renal failure given poor PO intake and she was given IVF without improvement.
Given this, her Metoprolol was changed from 50mg po bid to 37.5mg po tid with imprvement in her tachycardia.
# Malnutrition: Nutrition was consulted and recommended Ensure supplements with meals.
