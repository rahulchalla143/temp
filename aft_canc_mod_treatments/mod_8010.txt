Her nephrostomy pigtail was replaced and antegrade pyelogram indicated functional nephrostomy tube and persistent distal ureteral obstruction.
She was placed on zosyn and vancomycin was added when she was persistently febrile.
She was started on the dilaudid PCA, but had several episodes of hypotension while on increased narcotics for her pain requiring transfer to the ICU for monitoring.
Her PCA was discontinued and her fentanyl patch was restarted.
Psychiatry was consulted for management of depression and affective instability and recommendations regarding her multiple medications including clonazepam, lorazepam, mirtazapine and narcotics.
Thus psychiatry recommended continuing her mirtazapine and clonazepam, but suggested limiting prn ativan and narcotics as possible, recognizing the difficulty in this given her chronic pain.
They also suggested using seroquel for anxiety and insomnia.
She was transferred to the ICU where she received IV fluids to which her BP responded with systolics returning to the low 100s mmHg.
Her hypotension was thought more likely [**2-8**] to her pain medication regimen and poor PO rather than hypotension [**2-8**] to sepsis.
While in the ICU, this was again readdressed with her family, pastor, and patient, and code status was changed to CMO.
