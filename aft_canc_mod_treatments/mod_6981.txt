Admission Date:  [**2131-6-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2131-8-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2093-10-20**]     Sex:  F  Service:  MICU-ORANG  THE PATIENT WAS TRANSFERRED FROM THE [**Hospital1 **]-[**Hospital1 **] FACILITY ON [**6-5**] FOR A WEANING FROM HER VENTILATOR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF HER PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR, DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
She was admitted to [**Hospital3 33538**] on [**2131-4-17**] from [**Hospital1 188**] status post a Medical Intensive Care Unit admission for pneumonia.
Her weaning was complicated by her anxiety and tachypnea with this anxiety.
Cardiovascularly, she was stable with her baseline sinus tachycardia 110 to 120.
She also has hypokalemia with her diuresis and was on Spironolactone.
She also complained of night sweats times two days and mild stomach pains since she was started on her tube feeds prior to admission to the [**Hospital1 190**].
Hodgkin's lymphoma in [**2125**] status post CHOP and x-ray therapy.
Status post left pneumectomy secondary to Aspergillosis of her left lung.
Baseline carbon dioxide is 50 to 55.
Status post J-tube placement.
Lasix 40 three times a day.
Percocet one q. four hours p.r.n.
Olanzapine 2.5 q. day.
Lorazepam 1 mg p.o.
Spironolactone 100 q. day.
Buspirone 5 three times a day.
Lorazepam 0.5 q. four to six hours p.r.n.
Metolazone 5 mg q. day.
Protein supplements.
Amitriptyline 10 mg q. h.s.
Digoxin 0.125 q. day.
Reglan 10 q. day.
Colace 100 q. eight hours.
Iron sulfate 325 q. day.
Protonix 40 q. day.
Vitamin C. 23.
Subcutaneous heparin 5000 units twice a day.
Subcutaneous Simethicone 80 q. eight hours p.r.n.
ALLERGIES:   She had allergies to sulfa, Oxacillin and Verapamil.
Unknown what her reaction to sulfa and oxacillin was.
She had a history of Hodgkin's disease status post CHOP and x-ray therapy which was complicated by Histoplasmosis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, status post left pneumectomy for Aspergillus and had a recent admission this past Spring for a pneumonia.
She had been on pressure support, 30/5 40% FIO2 on admission.
Also, her anxiety for which she is on multiple medications and finally her increased dead space in which her VD/VT is likely 80%.
[**Known firstname 1356**] was kept on a T-tube during the day while she received her pressure support via her tracheostomy at night.
She had a temperature tracheostomy (6 F ETT via stoma) and was changed finally to a permanent tracheostomy on [**2131-7-12**].
We will try to continue to wean her from her ventilator at night.
She will remain on her T-piece during the day with blow-by oxygen and if she fails to wean from the ventilator at night, will remain on her pressure support ventilation at night on her home ventilator.
She has been on a regimen of Lasix, Zaroxolyn.
Her weight had increased to 124 over the past week and her Lasix dose was increased from 60 p.o.
She remained at her baseline weight of 119 to 120 pounds on this diuresis regimen and had no episodes of respiratory distress.
[**Known firstname 1356**] is very sensitive to large fluctuations in her potassium, which is volatile on diuretics, and given her constipation.
After the calcium carbonate was given, her heart rhythm returned back to her baseline sinus tachycardia.
After correction of her potassium and Diltiazem, her rate usually returns back into her baseline.
Cardiomyopathy:  [**Known firstname 1356**] is on digoxin 0.125 q.o.d.
With constipation, she develops a hyperkalemia from inability to excrete her potassium through her GI tract.
With her large diuresis requirement, she also can drop her potassium.
These potassium changes can be rapid, for example, she has had a potassium of 4.4 at 5 a.m. and developed potassium of 7.9 at 8 a.m. after not having a bowel movement for one day.
[**Known firstname 1356**] has been stable on her current regimen of 100 p.o.
Lasix twice a day, Metolazone 2.5 twice a day and potassium repletion of 200 mEq per day divided into five doses of 40 mEq.
However, she has dropped to 2.4 and her Lasix dose will be reduced today to 80 mg p.o.
[**Known firstname 30613**] nutrition is delivered via her G-tube with Resbilar tube feeds.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  [**Known firstname 1356**] has a history of constipation, especially when she uses narcotic analgesics.
She had been on Percocet for her pain that she had been experienced at her tracheostomy site.
Her pain is relieved with Tramadol, ibuprofen and Tylenol.
She also receives Colace and Senna as stool softeners.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was admitted on inhaled Tobramycin for Pseudomonas prophylaxis.
She then started to have an increasing white blood count and her inhaled Tobramycin was restarted and she was eventually levelled off on a TIW regimen three times a week for this inhaled Tobramycin.
She also is reliant on narcotic pain medications which have been discontinued for her.
[**Known firstname 1356**] has been doing well on a regimen of Amitriptyline which was recently increased to 75 mg q.
; Zyprexa 5 mg q. h.s.
She can receive Zyprexa 2.5 mg p.r.n.
PROPHYLAXIS:  [**Known firstname 1356**] is out of bed with Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy on a bowel regimen of Lactulose, Colace and Senna.
Her mother has been taught to care for her tracheostomy site and ventilator.
DISPOSITION:   Her disposition will be first to CC7 Floor where her potassium levels and diuresis will be maintained and hopefully titrated to keep her at her goal weight of 115 to 120 pounds and keep her potassium levels between 3.0 and 4.5.
When she is deemed ready for discharge home, she will be discharged home on her home ventilator with blow-by tracheostomy, oxygen in the days and question of pressure support at night if she cannot be weaned from her pressure support during this hospitalization.
Her mother has been suctioning her tracheostomy well since she has been here and has been taught much of her care.
She will have home [**Hospital6 407**] to monitor her potassium levels and to care for her G-tube and she will have respiratory therapy, Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy also perhaps at home.
