tracheal stent placement.
The patient spiked to 103 on [**9-20**] and was started on vancomycin and zosyn.
His L femoral line was removed and the tip was sent for culture--there was no growth to date.
A new subclavian central line was placed under sterile conditions on [**2197-9-21**].
The patient remained intubated after the procedure and required high doses of sedation to remain comfortable.
After the bronchoscopy with stent placement, his sedation began to be weaned.
Over the next two days s/p the procedure he was slowly weaned off his fentanyl and midazolam drips along with the pressor support with neo-synephrine.
By post-procedure day 3, [**9-25**] the pressor was completely weaned off and breathing well on pressure support ventilation.
The patient also remained somewhat drowsy after stoppage of sedation but has slowly grown more alert.
Hypotension:  The patient was initially weaned off pressors; however, as his sedation requiremnt increased, his BP required more support and neo was re-started.
Given his fever spike, there was some concern for septic physiology and he was started on antibiotics as above.
His BP also increased with fluid boluses.
He received XRT to spine, chest in addition to weekly carboplatin/taxotere (had reaction to taxol).
Dysphagia was biggest concern which improved s/p esophageal stent.
NIDDM: The patient was maintained on an insulin sliding scale.
His sliding scale was adjusted as needed for tight glucose control.
Eventually his glucose control required insulin drip.
After extubation and discontinuation of tube feeds, insulin drip was discontinued.
FEN: The patient was started on tube feeds which he tolerated well.
His NG tube was replaced with an OG tube out of concern for sinusitis.
On extubation, tube feeds were discontinued.
Speech and swallow evaluation revealed pt remained still too sedated to safely take solid and recommended starting him on small sips of clears.
The patient did requirement repletion of electrolytes including potassium, magnesium, and phosphate.
ACCESS: Right subclavian line placed [**2197-9-21**], discontinued on [**2197-9-23**].
