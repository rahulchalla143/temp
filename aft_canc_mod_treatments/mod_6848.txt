You had a blood transfusion which improved your blood pressure and your anemia.
You also complained of tongue pain, which is also likely due to your chemotherapy.
We have prescribed a lidocaine mouth rinse to help with the pain.
In the future, please avoid over the counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), as they may cause worse bleeding in your GI tract.
Please continue to follow up with your Oncologist for care of your cervical cancer.
