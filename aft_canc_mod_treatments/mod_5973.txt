Cholecystostomy tube placed by radiology Foley catheter  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 99500**] is a 62 year old gentleman with history of multiple sclerosis, [**Known lastname 862**] disorder, dementia, and chronic indwelling foley with recurrent UTIs (including ESBL klebsiella) presented from his nursing home with altered mental status.
His nurse practitioner felt he was likely colonized with VRE and proteus was sensitive to ampicillin, thus he was started on ampicillin at that time.
At that time, he was also felt to be fecally obstructed, so he was given a fleets enema to which he responded well.
Labs demonstrated WBC count of 27 with 16% bandemia and an elevated lactate to 10.5 which decreased to 8.6 with IV fluids.
A CT abd/pelvis was obtained to rule out bowel ischemia and surgery was consulted.
Although it is not clearly documented, he reportedly received 7L NS IV fluid resuscitation.
His ED course was complicated by multiple attempts at central venous access and he was initially started on peripheral dopamine to maintain his blood pressure.
A right IJ was then placed and MAPs remained in the low 50s so levophed was started in addition to dopamine prior to his transfer to the ICU.

CT abdomen/pelvis [**6-25**]: Detailed evaluation of the intra-abdominal and pelvic organs is limited secondary to lack of intravenous contrast administration and artifact secondary to patient arm positioning.
Infectious proctitis and inflammatory bowel disease also remain in the differential diagnosis.
Tip of NG tube in stomach.
PICC change - IMPRESSION: Successful exchange of a previously placed PICC line over the wire with a new placement of 35 cm double-lumen line PICC line with tip in the distal part of the SVC.
Tip of the right PIC catheter projects over the superior cavoatrial junction.
A biliary drain identified.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The patient is status post cholecystostomy with a pigtail drain coiled within the gallbladder fossa in good position.
Status post cholecystostomy with pigtail drain placed within the gallbladder fossa in good position.

Poor surgical candidate for GB removal and fevers despite antibiotics  REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Place a cholecystostomy tube INDICATION: Acute cholecystitis on HIDA scan.
Under constant ultrasound guidance, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4300**] needle was percutaneously placed into the gallbladder.
An 8 French dilator was used and an 8 French pigtail catheter was subsequently threaded into the gallbladder lumen.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
Mild sedation was used including 25 mcg of Fentanyl IV.
IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound-guided drainage and catheter placement within gallbladder.
I would recommend routine views of the knee for better characterization.

Brief Hospital Course: #Urosepsis - ICU course: On presentation the patient met criteria for SIRS and sepsis: WBC of 27, tachycardic and a source of infection, thought to be most likely urosepsis given frank pus drainage from the bladder, history of recurrent infections and his foley found to be obstructed.
The CT of the abdomen did not appear consistent with bowel ischemia, but the patient was initially started on flagyl given colonic thickening.
Upon arrival to the ICU, his CVP initially was [**7-4**], on a dopamine, levophed and vasopressin drip.
With input from ID, the patient was started on meropenem and daptomycin and flagyl was continued.
We were able to wean the dopamine to off on day 1 in the ICU, and levophed and vasopressin were weaned on day 2.
CVP was maintained between [**7-5**] with 500cc LR boluses on day 3, and the patient did not require additional boluses on day 4.
Based on sensitivities, IV meropenem was continued and Daptomycin was discontinued.
However he started having fevers again and hence flagyl was restarted.
Surgery deemed the patient a poor surgical candidate and hence a cholesystostomy tube was placed by IR.
Flagyl was stopped after about a 3 wk course.
Acute retention of urine was resolved after foley was placed.
Patient may be advised if an SPC is desired to see Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] in clinic given recurrent UTIs and [**Last Name (STitle) 27285**] obstruction due to MS.  [**Last Name (STitle) **] disorder: The patient had a tonic-clonic [**Last Name (STitle) 862**] on the first night of admission, that resolved spontaneously within 2 minutes.
His phenytoin and carbamazapine levels were normal.
He was maintained on his outpatient doses of phenytoin and carbamazapine.
Initial bump in creatinine most likely was secondary to obstruction, but also given hemoconcentration and response to fluids, appeared to be prerenal as well.
Given his poor nutritional status, may be a result of vit K deficiency, but certainly was concerning in the setting of sepsis.
- INR normalized with 3 daily doses of vitamin K .
Golytely given 2 L per day for two days with tap water enemas twice daily for two days.
Ileus was aggressively treated and resolved.
Patient has a new PICC dated [**2171-7-22**] and to complete aztreonam as above.
To make appt with IR for biliay drain removal as below.
ID, surgery to follow up.
