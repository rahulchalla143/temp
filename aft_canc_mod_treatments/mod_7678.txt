He was subsequently found to have near total collapse of his left lung with mediastinal shift towards the collapsed lung on chest X-ray.
He has had 3 previous bronchial stents for left main bronchial obstruction and hypoxia .
He underwent bronchoscopy by interventional pulmonary who placed a metal stent in his left mainstem bronchus.
A repeat chest xray immediately following the procedure showed reinflation of the upper lobe but persistant collapse in the lower lobe.
His supplemental O2 was weaned and he was ultimately satting well on room air at  discharge.
# Presumed Post Obstructive Pneumonia-  During the bronchoscopy the patient was noted to have several thick mucous plugs, and per Interventional pulmonary was started on Levofloxacin for presumptive  post-obstructive pneumonia.
He received one dose of IV vancomycin while the sensitivities  from the culture were pending.
He also received one dose of IV nafcilin.
He was ultimately sent home on PO levofloxacin and will have a 7 day course of antibiotics, ending 3 days after discharge.
He received 3.5 liters of normal saline during his MICU stay and the drop was thought to possibly be dilution versus peri-procedural bleeding.
He is on metformin and Actos at home.
While in the hospital he was placed on a insulin sliding scale.
At home he is on atorvastatin 40mg and Trilipix 135mg.
He was continued on the atorvastatin in the hospital.
His Trilipix was held, as it is not on formulary, but the patient who told to continue both medications at discharge.
These medications were held as the patient's blood pressures were stable but on the low side at SBP between 100-120.
On discharge his BP was 140/70 and it was recommended to the patient to resume his home BP medications.
He was continued on synthroid 200mcg each day  Transitional Issues: - Will need to follow up with PCP to get an offical 6 minute walk test and evaluation for pulmonary rehab - Will establish outpatient pulmonary follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 90949**] of [**Last Name (LF) 11084**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] on [**2101-7-26**].
