Diagnostic paracentesis in the ED was cloudy & blood, w/400 WBC (29%neutrophils 36%lymphocytes 35%macrophages).
Given 1 L NS, ceftriaxone 2gm for suspected SBP (before peritoneal fluid diff returned) and kayexelate for K 6.9.
Did receive an amp calcium gluconate, dextrose, and insulin for hyperkalemia.
Hepatology was consulted & recommended albumin 100gm and admission to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10; however the ED felt he was more appropriate for an ICU bed.
CT Abd/Pelvis findings raised concern for peritoneal TB, so he had surgical laparotomy for omental and peritoneal biopsies which showed granulomatous infiltration, giant cells concerning for TB.
Since clinical concern was very high for peritoneal TB, they initiated TB treatment w/INH-rifampin-ethambutol for planned 6 month course.
Pt was discharged home the same day antibiotics were changed as pt was desperate to leave hospital & agreed to DOT at home.
Daily labs by DOT VNA on [**5-7**] showed mildly increasing LFTs, tbili 10.1->10.8 alkphos 173 ALT 29 AST 78.
Plan was to continue current regimen (INH, moxifloxacin, ethambutol) until clear evidence of worsening LFTs.
DPH DOT nurses stopped following over weekend and when they were able to contact him again yesterday, were told by patient/family that they did *not* want to take TB meds and did not believe he had a TB infection because they heard his CXR was clear.

Mild predominantly macrovesicular steatosis with rare ballooning degeneration and abundant intracytoplasmic hyalin identified.
If the neutrophils are representative of the lesion, then an inflammatory/abscess process should be considered.
Radiologic and clinical correlation, as to the site of sampling, is recommended.

ID was consulted and felt that triple therapy with INH w/B12 supplementation, moxifloxacin and ethambutol as prescribed by [**Hospital1 2025**] was appropriate.
Attempted to obtain IR paracentesis, but ultrasound showed loculated fluid collections not amenable to drainage.
We discussed his treatment plan with Department of health who requested he stay on treatment for TB until his cultures from [**Hospital1 2025**] return negative which may take many months.
Hepatology was consulted and recommended albumin for fluid resuscitation.
Started on octreotide and PPI drip, octreotide was stopped after one day and was transitioned to PPI [**Hospital1 **].
Patient had Dobbhoff placed and was started on TFs as per nutrition recommendations.
He also was started on Lactulose daily to achieve [**3-17**] bowel movements per day.
Tube feeds were continued for 2 weeks and his liver function significantly improved from admission.
Had repeat gross blood in stool on HD 2 and was started on octreotide and pantoprazole gtt.
Also received vitamin K and 4 of FFP.
His HCT trended down slowly over the course of his hospitalization which most likely was attributed to continued phlebotomy more than GI blood loss.
Nephrology was consulted and recommended fluid resuscitation with albumin and initiation of midodrine and octreotide.
He completed a two week course of this regimen and his creatine slowly trended down to 1.3-1.5.
He was started on ceftriaxone and metronidazole for therapy for which he completed a 7 day course.
Vancomycin was added to his daily antibiotic regimen as well which resolved the cellulitis.
This was related to his underlying liver cirrhosis and initial discontinuation of diuretics due to [**Last Name (un) **].
Once his kidney failure was improving with treatment for HRS, torsemide was initiated and the pt's urine out and kidney function improved further.
After discontinuation of tube feedings his LE edema began to slowly improve as well.
Received 1L fluid and Kayexalate in ED, albumin resuscitation.
K down with albumin and was 4.0 on call out from MICU.
Improved with albumin resuscitation to 130s-140s and remained stable in that range.
Therapeutic  paracentesis was not obtainable due to significant loculations of the ascitic fluid.
