[**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully.
She was on aspirin and plavix for her common iliac stent.
During her hospitalization, she had an episode of large volume hematemesis, requiring PRBC support (x6 units) and a MICU transfer.
There she underwent two EGDs which demonstrated normal esophagus and normal duodenum, but showed three polypoid lesions in the stomach, one of which had stigmata of bleeding; she underwent epinephrine injection and cauterization to this area.
GI recommended a repeat EGD in [**3-20**] months, and a colonoscopy for age appropriate screening.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] aspirin and plavix were not reinitiated on discharge and she will follow up with her [**Name10 (NameIs) 1106**] surgeon as below.
Given that she will likely have a surgical procedure within the next two weeks, consideration of restarting her plavix alone after surgery was recommended.
A regimen of a fentanyl patch (25mcg q3 days), MSSR (60 [**Hospital1 **]), amitryptiline (10 qhs), gabapentin (900 tid), and 4-8mg oral dilaudid q6h prn for breakthrough was finally arrived at.
Peripheral [**Hospital1 1106**] disease and ulcerations The patient was on [**Hospital1 **] and plavix after a common iliac stent and angioplasty on right tibial artery.
These two medications were held given the GI bleed, and the patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 60470**] regarding when to reinitiate these medications.
She was briefly on vancomycin given her history of MRSA colonization of her RLE lesions, but this was discontinued prior to discharge as there was no sign of infection.
She was started on a small dose of lisinopril given her diabetes, though she did not have proteinuria on this admission.
She was continued on lasix per her outpatient dose.
DM2 The patient was started on glargine insulin, and she was discharged with 10 units qAM.
Ppx The patient was discharged with a [**Hospital1 **] ppi, an aggressive bowel regimen given her narcotics, and vitamin C, iron, phoslo, Zn.

Discharge Instructions: We are discharging you today, though we strongly feel that it would be more appropriate to fully change your pain medications over to oral forms prior to your leaving the hospital.
You should discuss your pain regimen with your primary care provider [**Name Initial (PRE) 3011**].
Hold off on taking your aspirin and plavix until you talk with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] tomorrow.
Take your other medications as prescribed.
Talk with him about your pain management, getting a repeat "EGD" within 3-6 months, and getting a routine screening colonoscopy.
Ask him about when to restart the aspirin and plavix.
The [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] surgeons plan to do your surgery in ~2 weeks time.
