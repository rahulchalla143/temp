Moderate (2+) MR. TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets.
Pt was intubated and transferred to MICU.
Given initially unclear etiology of patient's hypoxic respiratory failure, EKG was done to r/o possible acute ischemic event; this demonstrated questionable pathology.
This new pathology, patient's known medication noncompliance, existing aortic stenosis, and chronic diastolic dysfunction, were considered to be the likely contributors to her acute respiratory decompensation.
While intubated, patient initially received nebulizers and furosemide drip; diuresis was moderated given low BP.
Valsartan was initially held in MICU given low BP.
Pt was extubated and then converted to home regimen of furosemide PO before transfer to the floor.
Sputum gram stain obtained after intubation demonstrated gram-positive cocci in clusters, and pt was started empirically on vancomycin for PNA.
She was switched to Levofloxacin before transfer to the floor.
She will need to continue levofloxacin for three more days to complete a seven day course.
Neurology was consulted and believe her headache and gait instability may be a manifestation of cervical spondylosis.
The patient worked with physical therapy on the floor and was still experiencing gait instability.
Patient worked with PT and was still experiencing gait instability at discharge.
#Hemoptysis/Epistaxis: Patient began complaining of hemoptysis while in the ICU, thought to be secondary to intubation in setting of elevated INR.
# Chronic diastolic CHF: Patient was previously being treated for diastolic heart failure.
Patient was diuresed with lasix gtt in the MICU, and was placed on her home lasix dose upon transfer to the floor.
# Atrial fibrillation: Pt had supratherapuetic INR and warfarin was held in the MICU.
Pt was continued on amiodarone 200mg daily for rate control.
She was given warfarin 1mg PO on Monday, when her INR was 1.5.
She was administered warfarin 2mg PO on Tuesday, when her INR was 1.3.
Her INR will need to be monitored daily with warfarin dosed accordingly to achieve therapeutic INR level of [**1-12**].
Pt was continued on home regimen of hydroxyurea.
Soon after transfer to the ICU she became hypotensive and her valsartan was discontinued.
