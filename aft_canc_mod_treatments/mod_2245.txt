She came to the outpatient clinic for platelet and blood transfusions over the weekend.
The night prior to admission, she developed a frontal headache, runny nose, nasal congestion, watery and red eyes and had difficulty sleeping.
She presented for a scheduled visit at the clinic for platelet transfusion today.
She was treated with pulse Decadron until [**10/2170**] but developed hypercalcemia.
-She received high-dose Cytoxan for stem cell priming.
On [**2171-3-8**], she underwent an autologous bone transplant and attained a CR.
-[**2173-5-25**], she was started on protocol 04-130 with Velcade and Revamid--and completed 8 cycles.

Although no definite bony erosion is identified, increased subcutaneous air as well as air adjacent to the lamina papyracea on the left raises the question of breach of this structure, as well as transmission of infection via emissary veins, the latter mechanism being invoked to account for the tiny amount of left extraconal gas adjacent to the left lamina papyracea.
The diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement seen previously has improved.
New right-sided pleural drainage tube with small right apical pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 50 year old female with relapsed Stage 3A IgG kappa multiple myeloma, presented with neutropenic fever, hospital course complicated by GI bleed, invasive fungal sinusitis, and transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for pleural effusion/hemothorax then underwent an allo-BMT [**2175-3-14**].
She was started on high dose Ambisome and posaconazole for invasive fungal sinusitis.
Serial CT sinus and MRI orbit/head showed continued sinus infection, but no significant bony erosion on posaconazole and ambisome combination therapy.
She was tapered off the Prednisone and her Revlamid was held.
She continued to be neutropenic, and was continued on GM-CSF.
On [**1-5**] she was started on cytoxan/prednisone chemotherapy.
She remained pan-cytopenic after therapy and continued to be transfusion dependant.
Neupogen and epogen did little to increase her counts.
On [**2175-1-25**] she was started on Doxil/velcade therapy as she has not received doxil previously.
Decided to proceed forward with bone marrow transplant anticipating brother's arrival [**2175-3-1**].
This resolved and she successfully underwent BMT on [**2175-3-14**].
underwent tracheostomy on [**5-1**].
continued on ceftaz and tobramycin.
Renal Failure: Potentially due to over-diuresis but patient is grossly edematous and total body overloaded.
Previous meds thought to potentially be related are gancyclovir and acyclovir which were d/c'd without much improvement.
Continued cyclosporin gtt (dosed by level as tends to be renal toxic).
Hypercalcemia:Possibly related to malignancy versus medication additions versus side effect of renal failure.
Gave pamidronate 60 mg IV X 1 on [**4-13**], usually dosed monthly .
Most likely due to hypoxia due to supraglottis/vocal cord occlusion from black debris/clots as noted by anesthesia during intubation vs worsening CHF.
On zinc/vitamin C for wound healing.
# PPX: PPI, no heparin as plts are low, hold bowel regimen for now as some diarrhea, pneumoboots.
