IMPRESSION: No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified  MRI Clavicle: IMPRESSION: Bone marrow edema and enhancement of the left medial clavicle and manubrium concerning for left claviculomanubrial joint infection and osteomyelitis with surrounding reactive edema.
The left medial clavicle and manubrium are better imaged on this dedicated study and given differences in imaging technique, abnormalities likely have not significantly changed or have possibly minimally progressed since the MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2185-6-20**].
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 84994**] presents with numerous medical problems, including multiple myeloma, latent TB, h/o testicular and prostate cancer p/w acute onset left neck pain with left arm weakness in setting of cracking/stretching his neck, developing with strep bovis bacteremia of unclear source.
Unfortunately the yield of bone biopsy in setting of antibiotics is quite low and since the pre-test probability is high for osteomyelitis in this patient, it was decided to treat presumptively for osteomyelitis.
ID was consulted and felt ceftriaxone would be the most effective antibiotic for Strep bovis.
He was transferred to the MICU for ceftriaxone desensitization.
Colonoscopy was performed given link between Strep bovis and colon cancer.
Polypecetomy was deferred as patient was on a heparin gtt.
Since heparin could be safely stopped, the patient had another colonoscopy which was terminated due to a poor prep.
The following day, another colonoscopy was attempted and bleeding occured after the first polypectomy, so the colonoscopy was terminated early.
He was taken back for a 4th and last colonoscopy the following day and all remaining polyps were removed.
Patient will continue Ceftriaxone for a total of six weeks with close ID follow up.
He was initially pain controlled with IV diluadid, ultram, diazepam, gabapentin, nortryptilline, tylenol, and lidocaine patches.
He was discharged on gabapentin, nortryptilline, tylenol, lidocaine patches and po diluadid.
He was continued on home amlodipine, atenolol, and lisinopril.
During ceftriazone desensitization, BB and ACE-I were held, but re-started prior to discharge.
Recent PE: Reportedly developed [**1-29**] after a long flight.
Was on coumadin prior to admission.
Given patient's colonoscopy, coumadin was held and heparin gtt was started during hospitalization.
Heparin gtt was held and patient's hct stabilized in the upper 20s.
Spoke with patient's primary care physician who stated patient did not need systemic anti-coagulation given this was a provoked PE and patient has been anticoagulated for nearly six months.
Warfarin was discontinued during this admission.
Continued home lantus and HISS for coverage  Multiple Myeloma: Actively being treated in the outpatient with velcade and decadron.
Access: Right PICC  Code: Full Code  Medications on Admission: Not all of these medications are current.
Bactrim and antivirals likely given in context of velcade/decadron and naltrexone given past alcohol use.
Fluticasone, potassium chloride slow, metformin 500 [**Hospital1 **] and magnesium oxide were also on his DC summary list from [**Hospital1 112**].
