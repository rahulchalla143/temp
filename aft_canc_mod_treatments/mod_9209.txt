STAGE IV NONSMALL CELL LUNG CANCER:  Complicated by prior SVC syndrome and recent pericardial tamponade.
At the time of transfer from the ICU, the patient was receiving hydrocortisone 75 mg IV q. eight hours.
Per the recommendations of the Oncology Service, this was tapered and changed to oral dexamethasone.
At the time of discharge, the patient was receiving dexamethasone at a dose of 1 mg q.
On [**2103-5-4**], the patient was given intravenous fluids with resultant improvement of her sinus tachycardia.
FOLLOW-UP FOR TREATMENT OF HER HYPOXEMIA:  At the time of transfer from the Intensive Care Unit, the patient had an oxygen requirement of [**3-24**] liters on nasal cannula.
The patient completed a ten day course of levofloxacin for postobstructive pneumonia.
The patient had persistent hypertension which was managed with metoprolol, lisinopril, and Amlodipine.
A long-acting nitrate was initiated for preload reduction as well as treatment of the patient's known coronary artery disease.
The patient diuresed successfully without the aid of a supplemental diuretic and her oxygen requirement decreased to a point where she was on room air and ambulating well by [**2103-5-3**].
PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AND LEFT ATRIAL THROMBUS: At the time of transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was on a heparin drip for management of her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and left atrial thrombus.
It was decided that anticoagulation would pose a risk of intracerebral hemorrhage as well as hemopericardium that would outweigh the risk of stroke for the patient's projected life span.
The patient's heparin was discontinued for the possibility of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
BRAIN METASTASES:  The patient had previously received whole brain radiation therapy for treatment of her brain metastases.
There was a minimal decrease in size of the left cerebellar lesion as well as partial response to treatment in the leptomeningeal frontal lesions.
Status post pericardial tamponade, constricted/effusive pericardial defect.
