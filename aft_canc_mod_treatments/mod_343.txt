Admission Date:  [**2139-5-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2139-6-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2085-1-5**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old woman who developed Hodgkin's disease and was treated with mantle irradiation in [**2110**].
She did well with regard to her Hodgkin's disease but developed congestive heart failure and was found to have constrictive pericarditis and underwent a pericardectomy at the [**Hospital 9940**] Clinic in the early [**2126**]'s.
On [**2138-6-11**], she underwent a left thoracotomy with decortication of the severe left fibrothorax with an excellent anatomic result.
Her postoperative course was complicated requiring tracheostomy and a feeding tube.
Since that time she has had recurrent admissions for respiratory insufficiency requiring multiple bronchoscopies and an extensive workup.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2139-5-8**], the patient was taken to the Operating Room for a right lung decortication.
This was a prolonged surgery which was technically very difficult and the patient required eight units of fresh frozen plasma, nine units of packed red blood cells and 18 units of platelets for an estimated blood loss of four liters.
She tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively where she was closely monitored on the ventilator and required pressor support.
On [**5-14**] she returned to the Operating Room for a evacuation of a right-sided hemothorax and washout.
Her pain was initially controlled on intravenous narcotics and has now been weaned to p.o.
She also continues on her Zoloft for her chronic depression.
Cardiac:  All of her pressors were weaned after her postoperative resuscitation.
Her beta blocker had not been restarted but we are considering restarting that now.
Pulmonary:  She underwent chest tube drains of her right hemothorax until the chest tube drainage decreased and the tubes were all eventually removed.
She was gradually weaned from the ventilator and she currently tolerates being off the ventilator for a 24 hour period but as a means of assuring expansion of her lung and expression of any excess of fluid, she is placed on the ventilator for two hour periods twice a day on vent settings with very high peak inspiratory pressures as per the protocol outlined by respiratory therapists.
She is being fed via a nasogastric feeding tube at a goal rate of 70 cc/hour but due to the fact that she has ongoing nausea, she has not been taking a p.o.
She continues on Pepcid 20 mg b.i.d.
She continues on subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis and has had no problems with any ongoing bleeding since the time of her initial operation.
Infectious Disease:  The patient has been maintained on broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics throughout her hospitalization.
She has also tested positive for Clostridium difficile, as she has in the past.
She is currently being treated on intravenous vancomycin, intravenous Bactrim, intravenous fluconazole and p.o.
The plan is to keep her on this regimen for a total of a three week course which will be completed on [**2139-6-14**].
vancomycin for two more weeks due to her recurrent Clostridium difficile.
Throughout her hospitalization she has been treated with steroids to try to minimize the fibrotic reaction within her right lung.
Due to the fact she has improved and she is now one month out from surgery, the plan is to wean her off of her steroids.
On [**6-8**], we obtained an Endocrinology consult who outlined a tapering for her prednisone from 30 mg p.o.
After weaning her down to 5 mg for approximately one week, the patient will require repeat Cortrosyn stimulation test.
If the cortisol does not exceed 18-20, then she needs to continue on prednisone at 5 mg per day and should arrange for an Endocrinology follow up at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9941**] for further evaluation.
