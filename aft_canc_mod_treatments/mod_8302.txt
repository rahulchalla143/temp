Admission Date:  [**2121-4-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2103-4-23**]  Date of Birth:   [**2030-1-29**]       Sex:  M  Service:  FENARD ICU  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old male with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed in [**2103-2-16**] and recent radiation therapy to spine.
History of coronary artery disease status post CABG and MI in [**2100**].
The patient presents with hypotension and nausea, requiring dopamine pressors.
He was treated with oxacillin, which was changed to dicloxacillin for cellulitis and Levaquin for right upper lobe pneumonia.
He was saturating 93% on a nonrebreather.
The patient then dropped his systolic blood pressure to the low 70s at which time he was given Narcan, normosaline bolus, and hydrocortisone 100 mg times one.
There was little response to these therapies and the patient was started on Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin for presumptive sepsis.
The patient's pressures did not improve and therefore, he required a Dopamine drip.
When the patient arrived to [**Hospital1 188**] MICU he was mentating but lethargic with systolic blood pressures from 110 to 130s on dopamine drip at 15 mcg per kilogram per minute.
Coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**2100**], status post MI in [**2100**], EF 50% [**2103-3-19**].
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, B-cell type diagnosed [**2103-2-16**] found in T11 vertebrae and status post XRT times two treatments.
Status post spinal stabilization in [**2103-3-19**].
Paxil 20 mg p.o.q.d 2.
Prednisone 10 mg p.o.q.a.m.
Neurontin 300 mg p.o.t.i.d.
Ambien 5 mg p.o.q.h.s.
Lopressor 25 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Lactulose 30 ml p.o.b.i.d.
Methadone 2 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Florinef 0.5 mg p.o.q.d.
The patient is a retired business man with three kids and he lived with his wife prior to requiring rehabilitation since [**Month (only) 958**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following: Temperature 99.4, blood pressure 134/79, heart rate 85, respiratory rate 16, 91% on four liters nasal cannula, weight 54.6 kg.
(peripheral IV with dopamine in place).
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has a history of coronary artery disease status post CABG and MI now with hypotension and question of reported chest pressure, nausea, and diaphoresis.
The patient was given several boluses of normal saline and pressure started to improve with rehydration.
The patient was weaned off dopamine on day #2 of stay and maintained adequate pressures for the rest of his hospital stay.
PULMONARY:  The patient has recent admission with right upper lobe pneumonia treated with a seven-day course of Levaquin.
The patient received three days of Ceftriaxone therapy and then was changed to Cefpodoxime to complete a ten-day antibiotic course.
On admission he was requiring four liters to saturation over 92%.
The patient's Vancomycin was discontinued after two days when the patient no longer appeared to be septic.
Treatment was changed to just empiric coverage for community-acquired pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonia with the third generation cephalosporin as above.
The patient was maintained on an aggressive bowel regimen including Colace, Dulcolax, and Lactulose.
GENITOURINARY:  The patient has history of urinary retention and, therefore, Foley catheter was placed.
HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY:  The patient has history of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma recently diagnosed now status post XRT times two treatments to T11.
His pain was well controlled with Methadone and Lidocaine patch and Neurontin.
Radiation/Oncology was made aware of the patient's admission, but plans were to continue with outpatient XRT upon discharge.
Therefore, the patient was started on stress dose hydrocortisone upon admission.
Prednisone 40 mg p.o.q.d.
Florinef 0.5 mg p.o.q.d.
PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was continued on subcutaneous heparin and Protonix.
LINES:  A left subclavian central line was placed without event.
The patient's peripheral IVs in the right arm were removed secondary to tenderness and ecchymosis.
He arrived upon transfer with Dopamine flowing into his right arm peripheral IV, therefore, most likely the symptoms were secondary to either thrombophlebitis versus mild skin necrosis.
Paxil 20 mg p.o.q.d 2.
Prednisone 40 mg p.o.q.d.
with plans for a slow taper decreasing 10 mg p.o.q.week to a goal of 10 mg p.o.q.a.m.
Neurontin 300 mg p.o.t.i.d.
Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously b.i.d.
Senna one to two tablets p.o.q.h.s.
Colace 100 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Dulcolax 10 ml p.o.q.d.
Lactulose 30 ml p.o.b.i.d.
Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Methadone 2.5 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Cefpodoxime 200 mg p.o.b.i.d.
Florinef 0.5 mg p.o.q.d.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.q.d.
FOLLOW-UP CARE:  The patient should restart his radiation therapy treatments as soon as possible per his previously-scheduled plan.
