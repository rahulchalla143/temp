HOSPITAL COURSE:  After reviewing the endoscopic photos and discussing his options with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the patient opted for an elective Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **] esophagogastrectomy.
In brief, an Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **] esophagogastrectomy was performed with resection of the tumor at the junction of the stomach and distal esophagus.
In addition, during this procedure a feeding jejunostomy was placed as well as bilateral chest tubes.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the floor on subcutaneous heparin twice a day and an epidural for his pain control.
In fact he pulled out his nasogastric tube at this point.
Because of his significant AA gradient the patient was intubated at this time.
The patient was started on a heparin drip and was soon having therapeutic anticoagulation.
On postoperative day three the patient's nasogastric tube was replaced under fluoroscopy.
This was placed by the Vascular Service on postoperative day five and the patient tolerated the procedure without any complications.
The patient's nasogastric tube was discontinued and he was transferred to the floor from the Intensive Care Unit.
In addition he had his chest tubes removed without complications.
By the time he was being discharged the patient was on a regular post esophagogastrectomy diet with six small meals a day.
In addition for nutritional supplementation he received cycle tube feeds at night.
He was also put on oral anticoagulation with Coumadin and once his INR was greater then 2 it was determined that he was able to go home on oral Coumadin.
While on the unit he had been placed on antibiotics for several positive sputum cultures.
These antibiotics were discontinued prior to discharge and finally a physical therapy evaluation determined that he was ready to go home and that he did not need outpatient rehab treatment.
He was afebrile for the last several days and he was properly anticoagulated for his pneumothorax.
