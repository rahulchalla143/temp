Admission Date:  [**2104-7-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2104-8-6**]   Service:  TRAUMA  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83 year-old woman who presented initially to the [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2104-7-17**] with right sided costovertebral and chest pain status post fall.
In the Emergency Department she was intubated and a chest tube was placed for Pneumothorax.
After placement of the chest tube her pressure returned to the 120s, but remained labile.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Norvasc, Atrovent, Albuterol, Serevent and Flovent.
She is awake, alert, intubated and comfortable.
There is a right chest tube without any evidence of air leak.
Chest x-ray revealed no pneumothorax after chest tube placement.
Pulmonary:  As previously described Mrs. [**Known lastname **] initially sustained a pneumothorax, which was treated with a chest tube.
The chest tube was removed on hospital day number two.
These episodes were treated with multiple bronchodilators including the use of epinephrine.
Generally these episodes resulted in the need for increased sedation and increased reliance on mechanical ventilation.
Efforts included direct laryngoscopy using a Bougie and fiberoptic intubation.
An emergent cricothyroidotomy was performed.
This procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4468**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 101002**] and assisted by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6644**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 101003**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4427**].
Two days later on [**7-28**] an elective tracheostomy was performed.
Neurological:  Mrs.[**Known lastname 101004**] pain was initially treated with rib blocks and ultimately treated with an epidural catheter.
She was kept comfortable using intermittently Propofol drips, Dilaudid drips and even benzodiazepines for comfort.
It was felt the use of pain medication tended to decreases her blood pressure also requiring the need for vasopressors.
The epidural catheter was eventually discontinued when she became hypotensive.
Placement of the pulmonary catheter revealed pulmonary hypertension.
Consultation with the pulmonary service was done and it was ultimately recommended beginning Diltiazem drip.
In order to maintain Mrs. [**Known lastname **] on a Diltiazem drip Levophed and Dopamine were needed to maintain her blood pressure.
Gastrointestinal:  During this hospitalization a Dobbhoff feeding tube was placed.
Tube feeds Respalor were given at a rate sufficient to maintain her caloric needs.
She was also placed on Carafate for gastrointestinal prophylaxis.
For this Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was treated with Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin.
This was an appropriate regimen based on the sensitivities of these organisms.
Also during several of her initial desaturation episodes physical examination revealed crackles.
It was felt as though decreasing her intravascular volume would help her pulmonary status.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was started on a Lasix drip early in her hospitalization.
Despite being on a Lasix drip her daily weights continued to increase and she became more total body water overloaded.
At this point she was weaned off her pressors and a morphine drip was started.
Her ventilatory support was discontinued.
