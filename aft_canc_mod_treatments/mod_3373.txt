Past Medical History: PMHx: DM2, Aortic stenosis (mild per [**8-31**] echo), Hypertension, Peripheral Artery Disease, myelodysplasia/leukopenia/thrombocytopenia  PSHx: [**2141-3-2**] Open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with aortobifemoral bypass using a Dacron 18 x 9 bifurcated graft.
Patient started on broad spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn/Vanco/Cipro/Falgyl).
Patient was hypotensive, and anuric, given fluids and started on Phynelephrine drip for BP support.
Started on Lasix IV BID, started diuresing.
Patient made NPO overnight for procedure in the morning.
General surgery consulted-recommended IR drainage of RP abcess.
Central line was placed, started TPN,  the patient was given FFP and Vitamin K to reverse INR in preparation for IR procedure.
The patient underwent CT guided retroperitoneal abcess drainage and drain placement, returned to the CVICU post procedure.
Started on Heparin drip.
Continued on antibiotics, IV Lasix, and on RISS for glycemic control.
Remains on quadruple antibiotics, Neo and heparin drips.
Continued antibiotics, IV Lasix, and on RISS for glycemic control.
Remains on Heparin drip.
Patient was transfused 1 unit PRBCs for low HCT.
Continued antibiotics, IV Lasix, and on RISS for glycemic control.
Repeat abdominal CT was done showing Fluid collection anterior to the iliac bifurcation with air-fluid level, slightly decreased from previous study.
Retroperitoneal fluid collection and primarily in the posterior pararenal space now demonstrates no drain and appears larger than previous study.
An additional fluid collection tracking laterally and anteriorly within the abdominal wall is markedly increased and portions of it cannot be separated from colonic wall.
Both of these fluid collections would be amenable to drainage.
Patient was prepped and consented, under CT guidance a 10 French drainage catheter into right lower abdominal abscess.
Patient tolerated the procedure well, transferred back to floor.
Continued antibiotics, IV Lasix, and on RISS for glycemic control  [**2141-3-28**], patient had an episode of BP drop below 90's, was given Albumin w/ good BP response.
Heparin drip was held for anticipated CT w/ possible drain placement.
Patient had another abdominal CT, after which, patient was prpped and cosnented and under CT guidance, had successful insertion of percutaneous catheter into abscess in right anterior abdomen.
Heparin resumed post procedure and dosed with Coumadin.
Continued antibiotics, IV Lasix, and on RISS for glycemic control.
ID consulted- recommended to d/c Linezolid, switch to Daptomycin and Zosyn, continued with Cipro and Flagyl.
Cipro and Flagyl were discontinued per ID recommendations.
Physical therapy evaluated patient and recommended rehab placement, rehab screening started.
PICC line was placed in anticipation for longterm IV antibiotic therapy.
IJ central line, A-line and foley were discontinued.
Continued IV lasix for diuresis, repleted electrolytes daily.
2 retroperitoneal drains remained in place and draining thick creamy material.
Heparin drip continued while being dosed with Coumadin, on [**3-31**] INR was 2.2, Heparin drip was d/c'd.
Home meds were resumed.
Discharged to rehab on Daptomycin and Zosyn, to FU w/ Infectious Disease as planned to plan further antibiotic therapy, weekly labs will be sent to them as well.
-Retroperitoneal drains remain in place as well, will be re-evaluated by general surgery on FU who will plan removal of drains.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Retroperitoneal abcesses related to ruptured appendix s/p multiple CT assisted drain placements, ID to follow, on longterm ABX Ruptured appendix-on antibiotics, general surgery to follow Anemia-myelodysplasia/leukopenia/thrombocytopenia- acute related to infection, frequent phlebotomy, hemodilution and bone marrow supression from medications History of: -DM2 -AS (mild per [**8-31**] echo) -HTN -PAD -myelodysplasia/leukopenia/thrombocytopenia, HIT negative [**2-/2141**]  PSH: Aortobifem for AAA [**2141-3-2**], Graft thromboembolectomy [**2141-3-9**]   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: [**Hospital1 69**] Discharge Instructions  - You were admitted for abdominal pain, CAT scan showed that you had retro peritoneal abcesses that were most likely related to ruptured appendix,  - Drains were placed in your abdomen to drain the abcesses, these will stay until the drainage stops, the drains will be removed by the General Surgery team or possibly in the interventional radiology,  - You were treated with intravenous antibiotics, you will be on these antibiotics for a long time, you will follow-up with the infectious disease department, to determine when the antibiotics will be stopped, and possibly switch to oral antibiotics,  ACTVITY: - walk/out of bed as tolerated, - you may shower, no tub baths.
Diet: - continue your regular diet as tolerated  Medications: - You were started on a blood thinner called Coumadin, - You will need blood tests to determine the dose of Coumadin until the level (INR is stable at goal) - You will also be on longterm antibiotics for the infection, the infectious disease doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] determine [**Name5 (PTitle) **] long you will need the antibiotics.
Labs: - You will need at least three times a weeks INR until your Coumadin dose is stable with a therapeutic level INR.
