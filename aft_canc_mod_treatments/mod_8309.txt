Admission Date:  [**2141-6-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2141-7-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2055-11-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Zocor  Attending:[**Name (NI) 9308**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 112282**] is 85M with history of CKD, HTN, HLD, afib on coumadin, PUD s/p UGIB [**1-/2141**] who is presenting with chest discomfort.
He had a scheduled appointment with his nephrologist yesterday and reported his chest pain; he had an EKG done that showed, as per report, elevation in V1-V2, and loss of R waves in V1-3.
Of note, the patient is also on coumadin for his afib; he reports that for one day he was having black diarrhea.
His crits remained stable and he never required a transfusion.
The patient was bolused with pantoprazole and started on pantoprazole drip.
Both ASA and heparin were held given possible GIB.
Past Medical History: HTN Hypercholesterolemia BPH Obesity Atrial fibrillation on coumadin [**1-/2141**] - GI bleed at MWH --> erosive gastritis, erosive duodenitis, hiatal hernia, and duodenal ulcer.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akineis of the distal 2/3rds of the septum and anterior walls, distal inferior and lateral walls.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) **].
[**7-4**] Cardiac perfusion persantine  RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:    11.0 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Sestamibi Rest ([**2141-7-4**]);    29.6 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress ([**2141-7-4**]); HISTORY: 85 year old male with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, permanent atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease who had a recent missed STEMI.
Following resting images and two minutes following intravenous dipyridamole, approximately three times the resting dose of Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi was administered intravenously.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 112282**] is 85M with history of CKD, HTN, HLD, afib on coumadin, PUD s/p UGIB [**1-/2141**] who is presented with chest pain and new EKG changes, found to have elevated troponins and guaic positive stool, with peaked troponins and CK-Mb thought to have a missed antero-septal MI.
Given the patient's recent UGIB and concern for current possible GIB, also given downtrending CKMB and trop suggestive of the back end of an MI cath was deferred.
Patient was treated with medical management in house with metoprolol (atenolol held).
ACEI was initially held in the setting of acute on chronic kidney disease (K at 5.3), but after normalization captopril added back on to regimen and then changed to lisinopril.
Diuresis was started on [**7-2**] as he thought to be mildly volume overloaded.
While he was here we got stress test MIBI with persantine to see if there were potential other areas of his heart that could be interevened on.
The results showed Focal anteroseptal wall defect which shows improvement at rest suggesting persantine induced ischemia.Enlarged left ventricular cavity and global hypokinesia.
Calculated LVEF of 24% We told him many times that if he has chest pain to call 911 right away  # rhythm: The patient has history of afib, rate controlled on atenolol and anticoagulated with couamdin at home.
Patient remained in AF, rate-controlled on metoprolol in house.
Warfarin was initially held as evidence of GI bleed but we resumed this medication after decreased concern for an active bleed.
We sent him home on this medication and told him to follow up with a GI doctor about it.
We started him on K-sparing medications like lisinopril because it is a good medication for post MI patients and told him to eat a low potassium diet, to avoid potassium [**Doctor First Name **] foods.
Patient is anticoagulated with warfarin adn on an ASA.
This can be coorindated by [**Doctor First Name 3390**] in outpatient setting  # leukocytosis:  The patient was noted to have white count of 16.6 initially, down to 15.5 then down to 10 on [**7-3**].
In outpatient setting may consider starting aldosterone antagonist at some point, however his K should beb monitored, also may consider ICD placement after 40 days of MI (in [**Month (only) **]).

Outpatient Lab Work please check INR because patient is on coumadin for Afib.
We also didn't do any procedures like place a stent in your heart vessel because we were concerned you may have had a GI bleed.
If you feel chest pain please call 911 right away  please get your BLOOD DRAWN on Saturday [**2141-7-8**] for your INR to be checked.
We made the following changes to your medications: please STOP atenolol please START metoprolol - this is a good medication for patients who have had a heart attack please START aspirin 81 please START lisinopril 2.5 (this is in place of enalapril) please START pantoprazole this is for your peptic ulcer disease  We CHANGED your dose of warfarin to 4 (at home it was 5) because we were initially concerned you may have a GI bleed.
