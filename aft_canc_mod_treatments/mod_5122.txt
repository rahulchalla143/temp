In the office, she received 500cc IVF and BP increased to 91/55.
Per pt, she had had steroid doses increased a few weeks ago and since has been tapering doses.
Endorses fatigue and her most bothersome complaint is blurry vision which was her presenting complaint on her prior admission.
She was given Prednisone 20mg PO and Decadron 4mg IV for presumed adrenal suppression.
She also received CeftriaXONE 1g IV and Levofloxacin 500mg IV.
She was started on Norepinephrine for BP support after receiving 4L NS and a LIJ was placed under sterile conditions.
Past Medical History:  Stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer- c/b mets to brain, s/p brain XRT # bilateral posterior stroke with resultant blurry vision # HTN # Hyperlipidemia # Anxiety # Gerd # Degenerative disc disease  Social History: Lives in [**Location 8641**], NH with husband [**Name (NI) **].
1 PPD for 37 years - quit at time of NSCLC dx.
#  Hypotension - The patient was initially bolused 4 L IVF in the ED without much response in her BPs and was placed on levophed gtt on arrival to the ICU.
She was given 2 L of additional IVF boluses with success in weaning her off levophed.
Cardiac ischemia was unlikely given a EKG without ischemic changes.
She was given stress doses of IV dexamethasone for likely adrenal insufficiency (pt on steroids at home due to brain mets, has not tolerated decreases in steroid doses in past).
At the time of transfer out of the ICU, the patient had no longer required pressors for BP support for > 48 hours.
On the oncology floor, the endocrinology service was consulted and felt strongly that this was not adrenal insufficiency since she was still taking large dose of steroids at home.
She was slowly weaned off of her steroids by 4 mg weekly.
