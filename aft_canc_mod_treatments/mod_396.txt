A pleurocentesis yielded a malignant fluid that was later diagnosed as an adenocarcinoma.
The patient, at that time, was started on Taxol and carboplatin.
He went to dinner with his parents and shortly after, he started to complain of increasing shortness of breath that was not relieved by his home oxygen.
The mother reports that the patient started to hyperventilate and then briefly passed out.
2) A right hip fracture, status post open reduction and internal fixation in [**2150-6-6**].
MEDICATIONS UPON ADMISSION AS FOLLOWS:  1) Valium 2 mg prn, 2) Florinef 0.1 mg q am, 0.2 mg q pm, 3) [**Doctor First Name **] 60 mg qd, 4) Actonel 35 mg q weekly, 5) artificial eyedrops, 6) compazine prn, 7) multivitamin, 8) carboplatin and Taxol.
Given the dilated, gas-filled esophagus, aspiration pneumonia should be considered.
PHYSICAL EXAM INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING:  His heart rate was 105, blood pressure ranged from 180-65 systolic and from 130-40 diastolic, respiratory rate 32, O2 sats 90% on room air, 96% on a nonrebreather, temperature upon admission 95.4.
He was in minor respiratory distress on a nonrebreather mask.
The dyspnea appeared to be due to a number of factors, to include decreased compliance due to his kyphoscoliosis; a large pleural effusion; possible aspiration pneumonia; anemia; and questionable myocardial dysfunction.
In the Emergency Room, the patient was given 40 mg of IV lasix, and he responded with approximately 4.5 liters of urine over the next three to four hours.
Due to his autonomic dysfunction, the patient was repleted with several IV boluses for a total of 2.5 liters.
His net loss was approximately 2 liters in the first 24 hours.
Following the diuresis, the patient's O2 saturation improved and he was able to be weaned off the nonrebreather to the nasal cannula.
The patient was also started up on Levaquin for a possible pneumonia.
Initially, it was thought that this was due to his chemotherapy and Neupogen.
In discussion with the patient's oncologist, this precipitous drop was consistent with the nadir expected with his chemotherapy regimen.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1) Valium 2 mg prn, 2) Florinef 0.1 mg q am, 0.2 mg q pm, 3) [**Doctor First Name **] 60 mg qd, 4) multivitamin, 5) Actonel 35 mg q weekly, 6) artificial eyedrops, 7) compazine prn, 8) Levaquin 500 qd for 2 weeks, 9) lasix 10 mg prn for fluid overload.
