His labwork was notable for a BNP of [**Numeric Identifier **], troponin of 0.49, CK-MB of 19, CK-MBI of 9.3.
In the ED they were able to infuse 2L using the PD catheter and removed 2.5L for a net -500cc.
On the floor, he developed worsening dyspnea and was placed on a non-rebreather mask with O2 saturations in the high 90s.
He received an 80 mg dose of IV lasix followed by a 120 mg dose of IV lasix with no significant improvement.

Male with ESRD on PD [**2-18**] diabetic nephropathy, CAD s/p distant CABG, DM II presenting with hypervolemia in the setting of high sodium intake, with worsening lower extremity edema, worsening short of breath, and reduced urine output.
Dyspnea/Volume Overload: Patient presented in acute respiratory distress and required a MICU transfer requiring non-invasive ventilation.
Initial diuresis plan included Lasix 200mg IV, IV morphine, and nitro gtt.
Additionally, Lasix 80mg IV was given [**Hospital1 **].
Resp status became stable and the pt was able to be transferred to cardiology (see below for more details about cardiac cath and cardiac work up).
Pt was informed of new PD regimen by nephrology.
Prior to cath, IV lasix was d/c'ed in an effort to help prevent dehydrating the pt excessively.
We also continued clonidine and lisinopril.
# ESRD on PD: PD tx per renal dialysis team.
We continued the pt's sevelamer, treated with Aluminum hydroxide for total 6 doses, and used periprocedure mucomyst.
Seems to have stopped bleeding once coumadin was stopped.
Mr. [**Known lastname 57523**] did receive 2.5mg PO Vit K once, but his epistaxis was treated with afrin at bedside, humidified O2, nasal saline PRN.
# DM II: continued on home regimen of humalog 70/30, ISS and checked CBGs QID.
Holding Coumadin as per above.
Coumadin restarted at discharge.
Did not feel the need to bridge from heparin to coumadin as pt has not had previous h/o stroke.
He can f/u as an outpatient to titrate his coumadin regimen (we used a lower dose -2.5 mg, as he was supratherapeutic when he presented).
