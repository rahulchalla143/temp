Admission Date:  [**2108-3-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-4-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2039-5-23**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**] Chief Complaint: Bright red blood per rectum  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: EGD Colonscopy Distal Ileocolic Artery embolization IVC filter placement EGD with ERCP  History of Present Illness: HPI: 68 yo M with h/o MDS, thrombocythemia, HTN, COPD (fev1 62% pred, fvc 56% 11/06) p/w BRBPR.
Vit K 10 mg po X1 given.
Pt transferred to MICU for further management.
PROGRESS NOTE ON TRANSFER FROM MICU TO [**Hospital1 **]: 68 yo M with h/o MDS, thrombocythemia, HTN, COPD (fev1 62% pred, fvc 56% 11/06) who presented with BRBPR on [**3-22**].
He received a total of 10 U pRBC and 10 U FFP while in the MICU.
Given his h/o thrombocythemia with clots and the fact that his anti-coagulation was held in the setting of GI bleed, LENIs were performed that showed a chronic appearing L superficial vein DVT.
A RUQ US showed a thick, edematous GB wall that was concerning for possible cholecystitis and surgery was consulted.
He was started on cipro, flagyl, and unasyn and then underwent an ERCP in which a stone was removed from the biliary tree, a sphincterotomy was performed, and the CBD was noted to be dilated to 12 mm.
Influenza A--> "coma" for 21 days ([**2100**]) Pt admitted to [**Hospital1 **] for respiratory distress.
Incidentally was diagnosed with Anemia and manocytosis so got Bone Marrow Biopsy.
Recommend T cell receptor gene rearrangement study by polymerase chain reaction to rule-out a T/NK cell lymphoproliferative disorder.
His iron to total iron binding capacity ratio was 83%.
HTN: well controlled with Tiazadone  7.
PA and lateral chest radiograph with improved inspiratory volumes may be helpful for more complete assessment of these regions.
Successful coil embolization of distal feeding branches of the ileocolic artery.
[**3-27**]: Successful placement of Bard recoverable G2 filter in the infrarenal inferior vena cava.
Re-demonstration of nonobstructing left renal stone.
Patchy opacities at bilateral lung bases, which may represent atelectasis versus early pneumonia.
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome.
The stone was extracted successfully using a balloon catheter.
The left kidney measures 12.3 cm.
Foley catheter is observed in the decompressed bladder.
Unchanged non-pathologically enlarged mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
CXR [**4-11**]: Right-sided PICC line is again noted and although is difficult to evaluate the exact location of the tip, it is likely unchanged.
The patient underwent an SMA angiogram which showed bleeding at the distal ileocolic branches, which underwent successful embolization.
The guaiac positivity was discussed with IR prior to discharge, but no further diagnostic intervention was felt possible on their part unless he bled briskly.
ERCP resulted in successful removal of a stone and a sphincterotomy.
The patient should be scheduled for cholecystectomy with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) 468**], MD in the next month ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 476**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2835**]).
#) DVT: Prior to admission, the patient had been on chronic coumadin anticoagulation therapy for history of DVT and splenic vein thrombosis.
On admission with GI bleed, his INR was reversed with 10 mg of vitamin K.  A lower extremity ultrasound demonstrated a chronic left superficial femoral vein thrombosis, and an IVC filter was placed to prevent PE - in the setting of his bleed and having to stop his anticoagulation as well as his antiplatelet agents.
The patient was bridged with heparin and restarted on coumadin.
Given his current antibiotic regimen, his INR needs to be closely followed in the short term, and he is being discharged currently on 5 mg coumadin every day.
In the long term, it is expected that he will return to his coumadin regimen prior to this hospitalization of 10 mg every MON,WED,FRI and 5 mg every TUES, THURS, SAT, SUN.
He requires intermittent transfusions.
He required transfusions to upkeep his Hct while in house.
The patient was continued on epogen as directed by [**Month/Year (2) 1978**].
He was started on a course of ceftriaxone and azithromycin and discharged to complete 7 more days of these medications.
He has a PICC line which does not appear infected.
His PICC line should be removed once he has finished his 7 day course of IV ceftriaxone and may be used for lab draws in the interim.
#) Hypoxia: The patient required small amounts of nasal cannula oxygen intermittently after his ICU course, likely secondary to volume overload and atelectasis.
He should be weaned from oxygen as tolerated as he undergoes rehabilitation.
The patient may need lasix on a PRN basis (20 mg IV is suitable dose) if he appears fluid overloaded on exam.
He was admitted on aspirin and anagrelide, both anti-platelet medications.
It is expected that the patient will need to have a cholecystectomy within the next month, with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 24531**].
In preparation for this, the patient's aspirin and anegrilide were not restarted on discharge and need to be held until he is done with his Cholecystectomy.
#) HTN: - atenolol and diltiazem.
#) Gout: Restart allopurinol 100 mg qdaily as taking pos.
#) Access: R PICC line placed on [**3-30**].
Please remove after no more need for IV antibiotics (7 days).
