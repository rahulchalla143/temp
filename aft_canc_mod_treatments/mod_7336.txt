Sternotomy wires, pacemaker leads and surgical clips are seen in the mediastinum.
Continued peribronchovascular thickening and pulmonary consolidation in the left upper lobe may reflect post-obstructive consolidation and/or lymphangitic spread of tumor.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 year old man with a history of chronic systlic and diastolic CHF, ESRD, pulmonary hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and recently diagnosed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma who presented with worsening shortness of breath.
Patient was eventually transitioned to comfort care and expired on [**2115-5-25**].
He had insufficient urine output so renal was consulted, a temporary HD line was placed, and he was started on dialysis.
He was also found to have a moderate-sized left pleural effusion and plan was to perform a thoracentesis with placement of a pleurex catheter which was initially deferred due to patient's discomfort.
The patient had severe left hip/thigh pain (see discussion below) so he was pre-medicated with tylenol, ibuprofen, lidocaine patch, and IV dilaudid prior to the CT.
The plan was for thoracic surgery to do the thoracentesis and place a pleurex, however the patient declined this and the decision was made to focus on comfort.
We were reluctant to administer too many narcotics given his episode of apnea.
His pain was managed with IV dilaudid and a ketamine drip.
He was started on a morphine drip and expired the morning of [**2115-5-25**].
# Malignancy: Patient with supraclavicular, mediastinal, hilar, and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, as well as right renal masses which are concerning for metastatic malignancy.
After discussion with oncology, the plan was to perform a thoracentesis and send the pleural fluid for cytology, and to try and obtain another tissue biopsy for further diagnostic information.
However, his respiratory status declined and his pain control became the prominent issue.
A temporary HD catheter was placed and he was started on HD.
He was continued on calcitriol, calcium carbonate, sevelamer, nephrocaps, and vitamin D. .
Metoprolol was continued.
Coumadin was held given the left psoas bleed.
# CAD s/p CABG and PCI: Aspirin and plavix were held.
# Diabetes: Continued glargine and insulin sliding scale.
# Hypertension: Continued metoprolol and Imdur.
