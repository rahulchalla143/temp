Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF CLINICAL SUMMARY: 65-year-old male with atrial fibrillation who presented for pulmonary vein isolation complicated by pericardial effusion.
ISSUES: # Pericardial effusion:  Likely complication of heparin bolus and micro-perforation during procedure.
He underwent pericardiocentesis with a drain placement.
Repeat TTE demonstrated little pericardial fluid and drain was removed.
Colchicine (10d course) was initiated for pericarditis prophylaxis.
# Atrial fibrillation: s/p aborted pulmonary vein isolation procedure complicated by pericardial effusion.
The patient underwent electrical re-synchronization.
He will need to continue his antiplatelet medications upon discharge and follow up for a repeat pulmonary vein isolation procedure.
Held metoprolol while in house for relative hypotension, and discharged on succinate metoprolol 25mg qd.
# HTN: Patient was on metoprolol succinate and losartan as outpt.
These meds were held due to relative hypotension on admission.
The patient was discharged home with metoprolol succinate 25mg qd.
We deferred on treatment considering most likely a contaminant, but the second bottle final read needs to be followed up.
Titrate losartan and metoprolol if hemodynamics tolerate in outpatient setting.
