Her CXR was clear, however she was mildly hypoxemic after receiving IVF for her hypotension.
Zosyn was stopped and she was started on cefepime and vancomycin.
The patient underwent an optimal cytoreductive surgery in [**10/2116**] followed by six cycles of Taxol and carboplatin in 02/[**2117**].

2+ pedal pulses.
Interval progression with larger pulmonary metastases, adenopathy and new hepatic metastasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 25006**] is a 72 year old female with stage IIIA carcinosarcoma of the uterus and a stage I mucinous carcinoma of the ovary undergoing carboplatin chemotherapy who presents with hypotension.
Differential diagnosis included sepsis (perhaps [**3-18**] cellulitis of LE's, but without other obvious infectious source), hypovolemia (but appeared volume overloaded on exam), CHF with 3rd spacing of volume but intravascular volume depletion, versus medication (chemotherapy) side effect.
Differential also included pericardial effusion and tamponade - ruled out by TTE.
With treatment of CHF (diuresis with one-time doses of lasix) and of cellulitis (with antibiotics), saw patient's BP improve.
# Hypoxia - Developed in OSH ED after she received IVF for her hypotension; in the setting of AS and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, likely became volume overloaded.
Was voume overloaded on exam, with crackles, peripheral edema, weight elevation, BNP elevation.
Could be cellulitis vs. hyperemia from edema vs. reaction to chemotherapy medications (patient reports redness in legs previously when on this chemotherapy regimen).
Patient treated with vancomycin and then keflex.
Patient diuresed with lasix one-time doses.
Was 2.2 at OSH and became 1.3 after getting IV hydration.
Seemed pre-renal etiology given improvement in creatinine w/ IV fluids; then patient was diuresed for CHF/volume overload concern, and Cr continued to improve down to 0.8. .
# Normocytic Anemia - Was 32.8 at OSH; after receiving fluids HCT has fallen further to 30.
- continued home regimen of singulair, fluticasone prn, and formulary exchange maxair with albuterol.
# Uterine & Ovarian cancer - plan for next chemotherapy on Thursday [**4-24**], as an inpatient, due to concerns for side effects and desire for o/n monitoring.

We believe that your symptoms were due to fluid overload, so you were diuresed with lasix and your breathing (oxygen level) improved.
It is unclear why your blood pressure was low, but with diuresis (fluid removal) and treatment of infection, your blood pressure improved up to baseline.
The following changes were made to your medication regimen: - take Keflex (cephalexin), an antibiotic, twice a day until the evening of [**4-19**] - do NOT take your Hyzaar (HCTZ/Losartan) or Verapamil, until next week when you see your cardiologist or come to the hospital for chemotherapy (we are holding these medications temporarily because of your borderline-low blood pressure) .
You will then have chemotherapy that day, and spend that night overnight in the hospital.
