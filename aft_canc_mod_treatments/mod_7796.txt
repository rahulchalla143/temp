- Possible extravasation of contrast at level of tumor.
Given possible extravasation of contrast and presentation with cholangitis, detailed cholangiogram was not obtained.
- Likely distal pancreatic duct stricture - Sphincterotomy was performed - Cytology samples were obtained for histology using a brush.
She was treated with Zosyn for empiric coverage of cholangitis.
