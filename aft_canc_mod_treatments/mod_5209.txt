4.The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
Brief Hospital Course: #Cardiovascular-   STEMI:  Pt found to have NSTEMI with troponin peaking 1.232.
The RCA was stented with Sirolimus-eluting stents.
NSTEMI & post-cath therapy included ASA, Plavix, and heparin gtt.
Multiple meds were equired to slow rate (amiodarone, metoprolol, and diltiazem).
Because of this slow rate, her beta-blocker was d/c'd and her calcium-channel blocker was continued at lower dose--short acting diltiazem 30mg, three times a day.
The patient was also started on coumadin for the afib.
However, there was debate over whether the patient should be on coumadin (given her age, risk factors for a fall, and the fact that she is already on aspirin & plavix for her cardiac issues).
After extensive discussion, it was determined to proceed with coumadin therapy during hospitalizaiton and to discuss the issue with the patients PCP before discharge; however, we were unable to contact PCP prior to this discharge.
Becuase of this we eventually, decided that it would be safer for her to be off coumadin, and tx'd only with aspirin & plavix.
During cath, the pt underwent balloon valvuloplasty for AS (valve area 0.7cm2-->0.9cm2), reducing the gradient by 50%.
Pt tx'd with azithromycin, ceftriaxone & levofloxacin, which were d/c'd after concern of pt developing ATN w/ azithro & CTX and of further prolonging QTc interval.
#Pneumothorax: caused during placement of central line.
Resolved with chest tube.
#Anemia: Pt required multiple transfusions during hospitalization.
#Coagulation issues: after pt was started on coumadin for afib, she developed a supratherapeutic INR.
Coumadin d/c'd because of pt's risk for fall.
#FEN: pt started on tube feeds via NGT while intubated.
She continued on tube feeds s/p extubation after failing two swallowing evaluations.
She underwent a third swallowing evaluation with video imaging, which revealed that she could safely take ground solids and nectar thick liquids.
Required wrist restraints & a sitter for short period.
