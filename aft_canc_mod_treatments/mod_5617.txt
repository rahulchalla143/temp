An electrocardiogram done on admission revealed normal sinus rhythm [**Company 96461**]-wave inversions in aVL, V5, and V6, possibly old, also with poor R-wave progression, ST depressions, 1 mm.
The patient was transfused initially 10 units of packed red blood cells while in the MICU for a goal hematocrit of greater than 28.
They recommended holding the proton-pump inhibitor secondary to thrombocytopenia as a possible inciting [**Doctor Last Name 360**].

Thrombocytopenia:  Possible etiologies included medication-induced, ITP, TTP, hemolysis.
