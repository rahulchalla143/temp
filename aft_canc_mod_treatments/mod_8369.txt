Septic shock presumably secondary to VAP and was treated with levophed, IVF, cefepime, and tobramycin (colonized with MDR pseudomonas and initially treated with cefepime but isolated again from sputum now resistent to cefepime).
Patient then became volume overloaded following fluid resuscitation but responded well to diuresis.
Plan was to discharge to [**Hospital **] rehab for a scheduled 14 day course of cefepime/tobramycin to be completed [**6-17**].
IP revised her trach with placement of [**Last Name (un) **] device and excision of granulation tissue.
[**Last Name (un) 295**] was then replaced [**6-9**] with a permanent customined #7 Shiley trach.
Patient required mechanical ventilation throughout hospitalization with periods of apnea and presumed to have muscle weakness potentially from central process due to h/o CVAs.
Hospitalization complicated by persistent low grade fevers despite appropriate antibiotics thought to be most likely medication related rather than infectious(INH, ethambutol most likely).
She received Tylenol with temp decrease to 101.6.
She was volume resuscitated with 7L NS but remained persistently hypotensive so Levophed started with SBPs to 90s.
However, a repeat CXR following volume resuscitation showed blossoming consolidation in R lung.
She received cefepime x 1.

FINDINGS: Compared to prior examination, there is again evidence of prior right frontal lobe infarct with cortical gyriform calcifications.
However, when the patient's condition permit, gadolinium-enhanced MRI would help for further assessment.
Enhanced imaging would help for further assessment.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Consisted mainly of electrode artifacts about the C3 and O2 electrodes.
Brief Hospital Course: MEDICAL ICU COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the MICU from the ED with acute renal failure and evidence of worsening pneumonia and sepsis, recently discharged [**2147-6-16**] after a hospital stay treating hemoptysis, trach stenosis, VAP and sepsis.
Initally her hypotension was unresponsive to aggressive volume resuscitation in ED requiring pressors; however, pressures stablized in ICU.
Also, VRE from cath tip on [**6-21**], started on Daptomycin.
For the new PNA and sepsis, the patient was initially administered vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem for broad coverage with day 1 of therapy [**6-18**].
Vancomycin was discontinued on [**6-21**].
Tobramycin was added on [**6-19**].
The full course of vancomycin and meropenem will be completed on [**7-2**] and for tobramycin [**7-3**].
Of note, during stay flagyl was begun for empiric C. dificle coverage but was discontinued after assays X3 were completed.
Also daptomycin was begun as a removed catheter tip grew VRE; however, daptomycin was discontinued due to negative blood cx on [**6-23**] for VRE.
During her last admission creatinine elevation believed to be secondary to Tobramycin and antibiotic discontinued at that time.
This admission her renal failure was thought to be due to ATN given her history of hypotension, noting a possible contribution of Tobramycin to renal failure; the benefits of tobramycin in treating infection were felt to be greater than their contribution to her renal failure.
She could not be weaned from ventilator during recent admission or this current admission.
# Anemia:  The patient required multiple blood transfusions this admission to keep her hematocrit above a tranfusion goal that ranged from 21-25.
She was intermittently febrile during recent admission which could have been in part secondary to medication (INH, ethambutol most likely as was thought during her last admission).
However, medications cannot be stopped.
A catheter tip grew VRE although blood cultures were negative.
# Tachycardia: HR was systolically in 170s on admission and had appearance of sinus tach on EKG though it was doubtfully sinus given patient's age and level of tachycardia.
# Disseminated TB: Pan sensitive TB with liver and spleen granulomas on INH, Ethambutol, Pyrazinamide since 2/[**2146**].
Continue INH, Ethambutol, Pyrazinamide with complete course not finished until [**8-/2147**] at the earliest; ID to be reconsulted again before discontinuing TB antibiotics in the future.
# Pancytopenia: She has a h/o MDS seen on bone marrow biopsy with borderline transformation to AML.
She was given final dose of neupogen X1 today with plans to not continue neupogen in rehabilitation.
Lantus at half dose while NPO and insulin sliding scale controlled sugars reasonably well during admission.
# Hypercholesterolemia: Statin was held given mild LFT elevation.
# FEN: Tube feeds were administered at goal.
g-tube in place.
# PPx: - No heparin give h/o +HIT.
- PPI, sucralfate - colace, senna, lactulose, bisacodyl for bowel regimen, but holding bowel regimen now given diarrhea.
