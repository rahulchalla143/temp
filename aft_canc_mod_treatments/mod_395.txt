The patient presented to outside radiation technologist to receive radiation therapy to his groin, where upon discovery of symptoms, the patient was referred to the Emergency Department for further evaluation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] where he was noted to have congestive heart failure by chest x-ray, was started on Heparin drip, Lasix for diuresis and he subsequently improved.
During the cardiac catheterization, the patient developed worsening pulmonary edema and subsequent respiratory failure and required emergent intubation for this.
The patient had an intra-aortic balloon pump placed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory and the patient was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] emergently for a coronary artery bypass graft and a mitral valve repair.
The patient's ejection fraction had previously been determined on echocardiogram to be 25 percent with three plus mitral regurgitation.
In the operating room, the patient [**Last Name (STitle) 1834**] a coronary artery bypass graft times two, saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal, as well as a mitral valve repair.
Postoperatively, the patient was transported to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition with an intra-aortic balloon pump which had been placed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory on a Milrinone infusion, Levophed infusion, Epinephrine infusion.
The patient remained intubated on his first postoperative night with good hemodynamics.
The Milrinone was weaned down.
Intra-aortic balloon pump was removed on postoperative day number one.
The patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation on postoperative day number two.
On postoperative day number two after the patient developed atrial fibrillation, the patient was started on Amiodarone and Lopressor after the pressors and inotropes had been weaned off.
The pulmonary artery catheter was removed as the patient continued to have good hemodynamics in spite of the atrial fibrillation.
Chest tubes were removed without incident.
The patient's pacing wires were removed on postoperative day number five.
At that time, he was noted to have a moderate amount of serosanguinous drainage from his sternal incision.
The amount of drainage decreased over the next several days and had completely disappeared by postoperative day number seven.
By postoperative day number six, the patient had completed a level V with physical therapy and was able to ambulate 500 feet and climb one flight of stairs without difficulty and at that time had been cleared for discharge to home by physical therapy; however, due to the patient's drainage from his sternal incision, the patient remained in the hospital until postoperative day number eight at which time he was cleared from a cardiac surgery standpoint.
There is a small amount, less than one half centimeter, of erythema at the distal portion of the incision.
