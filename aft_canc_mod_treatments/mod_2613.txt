It was unclear why the patient suddenly became hypoxic from her congestive heart failure during the operation or in the interval following her operation as she only received 200cc of crystalloid during the AV fistula ligation and her oxygen saturation was 98% on room air pre-operatively.
The following day, the patient was administered lasix for diuresis and encouraged to perform incentive spirometry, but continued to require supplemental oxygen.
The patient continued to remain hypoxic on room air and was discharged with supplemental oxygen.
At the time of discharge, the patient was able to ambulate on supplemental oxygen without symptoms and was tolerating a regular, diabetic diet well.
