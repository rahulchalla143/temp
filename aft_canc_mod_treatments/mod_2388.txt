Brief Hospital Course: 53 year old male with multiple GI surgeries including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery with bile duct injury, total gastrectomy, distal pancreatectomy, and splenectomy, was initially admitted with malaise and fevers, found to have PICC line sepsis; during this admission, patient had a fall from bed with subsequent rib fractures and hemothorax, which required chest tube drainage and VATS/decortication for reaccumulation/loculation.
The patient's right PICC line was removed.
A new left-sided PICC was placed on [**9-23**] for prolonged delivery of IV antibiotics, and it was removed after antibiotics finished on [**10-3**].
The patient was treated with meropenem, vancomycin and levofloxacin.
The Interventional Pulmonology team inserted a chest tube for drainage on [**9-24**], and it was subsequently removed by the Thoracic Surgery team on [**10-3**].
Chest tube placement and removal was complicated by a minimal pneumothorax.
After removal of the tube, the patient continued to have intermittent fevers and periods of hypotension that were responsive to IV fluid boluses.
The patient felt that his breathing and pain was much improved following the surgery .
However, out of concern for his malnutrition, per his outpatient providers, the patient was further supplemented with TPN for ten days, while he had an indwelling PICC for antibiotic therapy.
TPN was discontinued when his PICC was removed on [**10-3**].
He was followed by the Surgical Nutrition team and they recommended high protein content supplements and patient followup as an outpatient to ensure he maintains his weight and nutritional status.
There was extensive discussion among his outpatient care providers, and the decision was made not to place another PICC line for TPN.
# Anemia: Over the course of this admission, the patient experienced slowly downtrending hematocrit from continued bleed into his left pleural space.
He was treated empirically for a UTI with seven days of levofloxacin.
Hematology was consulted and recommended no interventions at this time.
[**Name (NI) **] was continued on his home medications, including amphetamine-dextroamphetamine, clonazepam, diazepam, dronabinol, lithium carbonate, mirtazapine, oxycodone, Ramelteon, tramadol, venlafaxine, zolpidem and zonisamide.
