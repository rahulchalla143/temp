He was electively brought to the operating room for a planned Whipple procedure, but intra-operatively it was noted that serosal implants existed beyond the nodal disease which rendered this stage IV pancreatic cancer and the operation was aborted.
Retroperitoneal lymph node biopsies, exploratory laparotomy and open cholecystectomy was performed.

Biliary stent in place, with minimal pneumobilia, without biliary dilation.
Brief Hospital Course: NEURO/PAIN: The patient was maintained on IV pain medication in the immediate post-operative period and transitioned to PO narcotic medication with adequate pain control on POD#3.
The patient had some mental status changes in the post-operative period, which was attributed to his medications versus acute post-op delirium changes.
His medication list was optimized to avoid anticholingeric or delirium-inducing medications.
It appeared that his home Xanax was discontinued on admission and when resumed his mental status improved.
He did experience some episodic hypotension post-op requiring re-intubation and fluid resuscitation.
The patient's home anti-hypertensive medications were resumed on POD#[**4-13**] once his pressures responded to fluids.
His home dose of Plavix was restarted on POD#5, and his aspirin was continued immediately post-op.
A right-sided central venous catheter was placed pre-op and removed on POD#5 when he was deemed hemodynamically stable.
His ABG revealed evidence of hypercarbia and carbon dioxide retention post-op and he required re-intubation on POD#0.
The patient denied cough or respiratory symptoms following this, and was maintained on nebulizers and pulmonary treatments.
Pulmonology was consulted pre-op for clearance, and they continued following post-op, and they recommended continuing his MDIs.
GASTROINTESTINAL: The patient was NPO following their procedure and maintained on IV fluids for hydration while NPO.
Serial abdominal exams were performed, and once flatus resumed, the patient was transitioned to a clear liquid diet and their IV fluids were hep-locked on POD#[**4-13**].
He was empirically placed on IV Vancomycin and Zosyn with improvement.
A Foley catheter was placed intra-operatively and removed on POD#2, at which time the patient was able to successfully void without issue.
On POD#4 a Foley catheter was replaced for some low urine output and the need for monitoring given the previous concerns for anastomotic leak or bleeding.
The Foley was successfully removed again on POD#8.
The patient initially only received standard peri-operative antibiotics, but was started on empiric IV Vancomycin and Zosyn on the evening of POD#4 given concerns for anastomotic leak or infection.
He clinically improved with IV antibiotics and his fevers resolved.
He was continued on IV Zosyn and transitioned to PO-Cipro for a 2-week course, which he will complete on discharge.
Blood glucose levels greater than 120 mg/dL were addressed with an insulin sliding scale.
His home anti-hyperglycemic medications were resumed when diet was restored.
PROPHYLAXIS: The patient was maintained on heparin 5000 units SQ [**Hospital1 **] for DVT/PE prophylaxis and encouraged to ambulate immediately post-op once cleared by physical therapy.
