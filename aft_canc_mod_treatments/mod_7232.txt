Prophylactic internal fixation right femur with an 11 hole DC plate 3.
He underwent treatment with preoperative radiation and chemotherapy as the radiosensitizer but the mass got even larger and unfortunately his pulmonary metastases increased in size and number.
It was recommended that he consider chemotherapy for his pulmonary mets but he strongly desired to have this thigh mass removed first and therefore he was brought to the operating room today for that procedure.
While in the PACU the patient became tachycardic and hypotensive with low UOP, his thigh incision was draining bloody fluid (300cc in 2 hours).
His dressing was reinforced and his heart rate was controlled with medication.
Of note he was started on Hydrocortisone in the ICU secondary to a low random cortisol (0.6).
Hydrocortisone was discontinued on POD 2 after discussion with endocrine.
His blood sugar normalized after the steroid was discontinued.
