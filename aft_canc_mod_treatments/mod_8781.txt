The patient's right cerebellopontine angle meningioma has dramatically increased in size and now has considerable mass effect upon the underlying cerebellum and brain stem.
The heart, lungs, and mediastinum are unremarkable.
Patient found to be in acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, and profound encephalopathy with newly discovered 3x4 cm meningioma.
Her sodium rose slowly to 151 but she could not receive free water due to increased ICP.
She was begun on decadron (10 mg IV x1 then 4IV q6h) per neurology recs.
MRI C-spine was also recommended by neuro (C-spine unable to be cleared clinically) but was inconclusive to clear her c-spine.
Her bicarb gtt was changed to NS per renal recs, and was then changed just to PPN as she was felt to be euvolemic and did not require more fluid resuscitation.
She did not require pressors and recovered her BP on her own.
She was started on Ceftazidime and Nafcillin.
Per ID vancomycin was added prior to speciation/sensitivities to cover possible MRSA.
The patient had a NG tube placed and was noted to have blood returning from it.
At that meeting they were informed of her hospital course and overall poor prognosis and decided that the plan of care most concordant with her wishes would be to provide comfort measures only, stopping invasive interventions such as IV medications, antibiotics, feeding tubes, hemodialysis (should it have become necessary), endoscopic evaluation, vital signs and lab draws.
Creatinine continued to trend down during this hospital course though no where near baseline, urine lytes [**10-21**] and renal US most consistent with intrinsic renal disease.
No need for HD at this point, given goals of care.
HYPOTENSION:  Patient became hypotensive on floor and was transferred back to MICU for IVF resuscitation.
She was on nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia and MSSA in urine which have cleared.
Nafcillin was discontinued with family approval after goals of care changed to CMO status.
Antibiotics discontinued as above after CMO status determined.
NGT blood could be [**12-28**] trauma vs gastritis in setting of steroids vs PUD vs AVM.
Morphine and ativan used to keep patient comfortable.
She was manintained on steroids IV to control edema until goals of care were changed to comfort measures.
7 THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Patient's platelets have decreased significantly since admission.
patient is on adequate steroid dose for ITP which also makes this less likely.
Abraision wounds on extensor surfaces should be dressed as follows: cleanse all ulcers with commercial wound cleanser, pat dry, for elbows and knee apply wound gel to ulcer bases, cover with allevyn foam, change q3days.
Placed back in c-collar for stabilization, which was removed once goals of care changed to comfort measures only.
10 HYPERNATREMIA: This evolved during her hospital course thought to be secondary to free water restriction inate to mental status changes and resolved following IVF hydration with D5 1/2NS.
11 HYPERTENSION - patient was hypertensive on arrival in the unit, which may be due to mass effect seen on CT. Neuro recommends maintaining SBP<160, antihypertensive medications were held to allow autoregulation and her blood pressure actually became of hypotensive as described above.
13 Hyperlipidemia - her statin was held out of concern for rhabdomyolisis with her fall and not restarted.
