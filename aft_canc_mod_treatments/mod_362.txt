Stable bronchiectatic scarring and central lymph node calcifications.
Kidney biopsy [**12-15**]: Pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis in the setting of ANCA positivity  Skin biopsy [**11-27**] left chest -Squamous cell carcinoma in situ, extending near but not seen at the examined specimen margins.
Subsequent studies found the patient to have C-ANCA positive pauci-immune glomerulonephritis proven on kidney biopsy, consistent with Wegener's granulomatosis.
The patient received a mini-pulse of 250mg methylprednisolone and cytoxan, which initially improved his renal failure.
He was continued on cytoxan and prednisone.
He was transferred to the MICU on [**12-28**] where a temporary HD line was placed and CVVH was initiated.
9.5 litres were dialysed off and the patient was discharged back to the floor.
However, his creatinine continued to fail to improve and on [**1-2**] the patient received a session of hemodialysis and a permanent tunnelled catheter.
Steroids and cytoxan were initiated for treatment as above.
Bactrim prophylaxis was also initiated.
He was initially overcoagulated, reversed with vitamin K. His coumadin was held.
He was placed on a heparin drip when he went to the MICU, but had several supratherapeutic PTT's and developed a GI bleed.
He also had several episodes of RVR, which were controlled with diltiazem as needed.
He was not placed on a standing nodal [**Doctor Last Name 360**] given his history of sick sinus syndrome.
Thrombocytopenia  the patient's platelets began to slowly drop after admission to the MICU and starting of heparin drip.
Etiologies were thought potentially to be [**3-10**] TB or cytoxan treatment or heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
Mycobacterium Avium Complex AFB on Bronchoalveolar Lavage Latent Tuberculosis Isoniazid Hepatoxicity  Patient had a history of TB with treatment in sanitarium in [**2052**]'s  Bronchoscopy with BAL was performed on [**12-23**], and AFBs found on smear.
Final decision on treatment was pending genetic probe on culture from State lab.
The patient opted to forego MAC therapy and the treatment of his latent TB was discontinued secondary to hepatoxicity  GI bleed   the patient developed a GI bleed with maroon stools, BRBPR and melena on [**12-31**] after discharge from MICU.
GI consultation was acquired, and heparin infusion was stopped.
The bleeding was thought to be secondary to radiation proctitis for which the patient has a history of and had received laser photocoagulation.
Receives Darbepoetin monthly.
Diabetes patient was switched to glargine from previous regimen of NPH with good control of his blood glucose while inpatient.
