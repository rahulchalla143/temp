Admission Date:  [**2117-11-19**]     Discharge Date:  [**2117-11-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2069-9-17**]     Sex:  F  Service:  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Status post operation on [**2117-11-19**] consisting of pelvic examination under anesthesia, supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, evaluation of the left ureter to confirm left ureteral patency.
This evaluation consisted of evaluation of the position of the ureter within the pelvis relative to the hysterectomy ties followed by pelvic ureteral 3 mm ureterotomy with antegrade left ureterogram and cystogram.
The 3 mm ureterotomy was then closed with 4-0 vicryl and a JP drain placed.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 48 year-old para 1011 and she was followed at [**Hospital3 9732**] for uterine fibroids extending up to the umbilical level.
She reported significant chronic discomfort from her very enlarged uterus including pain with bending and movement.
She therefore requested a hysterectomy and on further counseling decided also in favor of prophylactic oophorectomy at the time of the hysterectomy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Seizure disorder with her last seizure in [**2106**] and her current dose of Dilantin at 100 mg po b.i.d.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] underwent a supracervical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and evaluation of her left ureter to confirm left ureteral patency on [**2117-11-19**].
For details of the description of the procedure please refer to the dictated operative note.
During the surgery she received 2 units of packed red blood cells for transfusion and her postoperative hematocrit was approximately 35%.
Because her surgery involved a longer time period and transfusion of 2 units of blood she was taken to the Intensive Care Unit for overnight observation and management of fluid levels.
Ms. [**Known lastname 9733**] recovery from her surgery has been normal.
Her pain was initially managed with a Dilaudid PCA pump, but by postoperative day four her pain was in control with Motrin and an occasional percocet.
She received 2 doses of prophylactic Cefazolin during her surgery and no antibiotics after the surgery.
She did receive Protonix to protect her stomach, heparin subQ 5000 b.i.d.
for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis and pneumoboots.
Because her preoperative Dilantin level was very low at less then 0.6 her Dilantin the week prior to surgery was increased from 100 mg po b.i.d.
and in the immediate postop period her Dilantin dose was increased to 400 mg po q day.
To follow her left ureter, a JP drain had been placed in the left pelvic cul-de-sac and a Foley catheter was placed in her bladder.
The JP drain was placed in the left pelvis in order to confirm that the left ureterotomy repair was intact and not leaking.
The Foley catheter was kept in the bladder for four days postop to keep distention tension off of the ureterotomy repair.
On postop day three the Foley catheter was removed for the first time from the bladder and immediately after removing the Foley catheter we noticed increased output of the pelvic JP drain from a scant level the day before up to 300 cc within four hours.
Because of that abrupt increase in the JP drain output right after removal of the Foley the Foley catheter was placed back into the bladder and the serosanguinous drainage from the JP drain as well as the urine were both sent for creatinine values.
It was therefore felt that the output from the JP drain represented physiologic serosanguinous fluid.
The Foley catheter was again removed last night and she has voided spontaneously with minimal post void residuals based on ultrasound scanning.
At this time the plan is to send Ms. [**Known lastname **] home and we are awaiting the opinion of the urology team as to when to remove the JP drain from the pelvis.
The drain will possibly be removed before Ms. [**Known lastname **] goes home today or perhaps in several days time depending on the opinion of the urology team.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Protonix 40 mg po q day, Dilantin 100 mg po b.i.d., Zyrtec 10 mg po q day, Motrin 600 mg po q 6 hours prn pain, Percocet 5/325 one to two po q 4 to 6 hours prn pain, Niferex 150 mg po q day and multivitamin with iron.
Of note, [**Known firstname **] will hold off on the iron pills until she feels that her bowel function has returned more.
Also we are awaiting a free Dilantin level in order to decide exactly what dose of Dilantin to send her home on.
[**Known firstname **] will have an appointment to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9734**] in another two days for staple removal and a wound check.
