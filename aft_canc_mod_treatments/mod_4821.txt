Admission Date:  [**2118-6-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-7-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-5-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: EMERGENCY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2565**] Chief Complaint: Failure to wean from mechanical ventilation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2118-6-23**] Dynamic flexible bronchoscopy [**2118-6-27**] Rigid bronchoscopy; decannulation of [**Last Name (un) 295**] tracheostomy tube; flexible bronchoscopy; airway surveillance and therapeutic aspiration; #14 10 x 10 Dumon silicone Y- stent placement.
[**2118-6-28**] Rigid bronchoscopy, flexible bronchoscopy, stent removal, stent replacement and tracheostomy tube change to Portex Perfect-Fit #7.
[**2118-7-2**] Flexible bronchoscopy through tracheostomy tube.
Repositioning of tracheostomy tube telescoped within a Y silicone stent.
[**2118-7-7**] Flexible bronchoscopy through tracheostomy tube.
Tracheostomy tube change from a #7 to a #8 Portex cuffed.
[**2118-7-7**] Femoral central venous catheter and arterial line placement [**2118-7-11**] Resizing of tracheostomy to #9.
[**2118-7-11**] PICC placement   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 62F with a medical history of SLE, mechanical ventilation s/p tracheostomy ([**2116**]) with worsening ventilator requirement transferred from outside hospital for interventional pulmonary evaluation.
She underwent tracheostomy in [**9-/2117**] with unclear etiology of her respiratory failure.
Per mother no history of respiratory disease but underwent colonoscopy and required intubation during this for respiratory distress.
Following this she could spend several hours during the day off the ventilator and use a passy muir valve, although typically at night required mechanical ventilation.
Regarding her outside hospital course, she was found to have multi-drug resistant pseudomonas in her sputum and was treated with ceftazidime and amikacin.
The prominent finding on the needle examination is the reduced activation in all muscles examined; this finding may be seen in weakness of an upper motor neuron origin or can also be related to submaximal effort-clinical correlation is recommended to evaluate this question more fully.
Tracheostomy tube and tracheal Y stent in place, without evidence of complication.
Status post distal esophageal resection with gastric pull-up repair, with fluid seen within the dilated esophagus into the upper thorax, increasing risk for aspiration.
Compression fractures at other mid-thoracic levels are age indeterminate.
Recommend correlation with mammography on a non-urgent basis.
