+diffuse SAH, intubated for airway    protection, now s/p coiling of aneurysm, L MCA coiling & stent and    ventriculostomy placement [**10-1**], s/p angio & IA verapamil [**10-5**].
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    s/p PICC line placement    Provisional Findings Impression: SP TUE [**2153-10-30**] 3:06 PM PICC line terminating in mid SVC.
Final Report TYPE OF EXAMINATION: Chest AP portable single view  INDICATION: Status post PICC line.
History of diffuse SAH, intubated for airway protection.
A previously present NG tube and right internal jugular approach central venous line have been removed.
There is now evidence of a right-sided PICC line seen to terminate overlying the SVC at the level of the carina.
No acute parenchymal infiltrates are seen, and thus chest findings are unaltered in comparison with a previous study.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The lung bases show mild dependent atelectasis.
A subcentimeter hypodensity in the right lobe of the liver (2:11) is too small to characterize.
NG tube terminates in the stomach.
Degenerative changes are seen involving the lower lumbar spine most notably involving L5-S1 with disc space narrowing, marginal osteophyte, and endplate sclerosis.

The patient tolerated the angio and EVD placement well.
On HD2 ([**10-1**]), patient was taken back to angio suite and another aneurysm was coiled and a stent was placed.
Patient tolerated the procedure well.
HD6 ([**10-5**]) Patient was taken to angio suite where an angiogram was performed with verapamil injected into the vessel to treat spasm.
Patient tolerated the procedure well and was following commands and talking.
Patient was empirically started on Vancomyin.
HD9 ([**10-8**])Patient continued to have fevers, central lines were changed by SICU team.
Clamp trial for EVD removal yeilded EVD had to be opened twice for ICP spiking to 30.
ID continued to follow for fever and recommended therapy with Nafcillin for 4 weeks from the last positive CSF culture which was on [**10-7**].
He underwent coiling in angio and placement of an additional right frontal ventricular drain since the Left drain had clotted off.
can tolerate being without a shunt or whether he is shunt dependant and will require a VPS on this hospitalization.
During his ICU stay - he did develop Thrombocytosis to >1,000 plts / he was started on ASA - this was held periodically for the placement of VPS and later restarted / he will continue this unitl seen in f/u at neurosurgery office.
His staples should be removed on [**11-10**].
He was transferred to the step down unit and maintained on telemetry which noted V tach on [**2153-11-5**] / cardiology was consulted and their recs were followed / He is now on Verapamil 80 TID and metoprolol has been adjusted and will continue with Metoprolol XL 100MG daily.
His PICC line on the left UE remains in place.
