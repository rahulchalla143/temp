History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant 53 y/o F with Stage IIB (T2N0M0) adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus s/p neoadjuvant therapy who presents for follow up after an open J tube placement 3 weeks ago.
Pt had J tube placed due to issues with PO intolerance and nausea/vomiting.
Initial attempt was made at laparoscopic J tube placement, however the operation was converted to open due to extensive adhesive disease requiring lysis of adhesions and resection of a small portion of small bowel.
Pt has been taking compazine for these episodes with minimal relief.
She is tolerating her J tube feeds.
Past Medical History: Oncologic history - [**2109-9-17**] - EGD revealed a 6 cm ulcerated tumor in the lower third of the esophagus, following a CT of the abdomen for chronic abdominal symptoms showing thickening of the esophagus.
[**2109-10-2**] - PET/CT ruled out metastasis [**2109-10-14**] - C1D1 Cisplatin (75 mg/m2 Day1)/5-Fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 days 1, 2, 3 and 4) concurrent chemoradiation [**2109-11-11**] - C2D1 Cisplatin (75 mg/m2 Day1)/5-Fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 days 1, 2, 3 and 4) concurrent chemoradiation [**2109-11-19**] - [**2109-11-23**] Admitted for poor PO intake and esophageal pain XRT: 28 Fractions from [**2108-3-12**], Total Dose 5040 cGy.

Post-surgical changes consistent with esophagectomy with intrathoracic anastomosis.
Given contrast was not administered orally, a small leak cannot be excluded.
If clinically indicated and feasible, revaluation after per-oral contrast administration may be obtained.
High-density lesion within the small bowel mesentery adjacent to surgically placed jejunostomy tube likely represents a small mesenteric hematoma.
Post-surgical changes consistent with esophagectomy and intrathoracic anastomosis remain stable.
Right pleural effusion, which appears partially loculated and with an intrafissural component appears substantially decreased in size.
Right chest tube and a mediastinal drain appearing in place.
[**2110-1-30**] Ba swallow : Status post esophagectomy with intrathoracic anastomosis.
Following removal of pleural drains, large, nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion, has increased with new large anterior loculation, responsible for persistent severe atelectasis, right middle and lower lobes.
She tolerated the procedure well and returned to the ICU in stable condition.
Her pain was controlled with an epidural catheter effectively.
She underwent vigorous pulmonary toilet in the ICU and her J tube feedings were started and her chest tubes were removed.
Following transfer to the surgical floor she desaturated to the mid 80's and developed atrial fibrillation which prompted transfer to the ICU for further management.
Her rapid afib was controlled with Lopressor then a Diltiazem drip.
She converted to sinus rhythme with IV Amiodarone.
She also had a right thoracentesis with placement of a right pigtail catheter.
Her respiratory issues continued and a left pigtail catheter was eventually placed and her breathing improved as her effusions decreased.
Unfortunately her dyspneic episodes recurred despite TPA through the right pigtail, clearing of her left effusion and replacement of her right pigtail catheter.
On [**2110-2-5**] she was taken back to the Operating Room where she underwent a right VATS with washout and decortication along with bronchoscopy.
She was using her incentive spirometer effectively and her oxygen was gradually weaned off.
Her chest tubes were removed once the drainage decreased and her port sites were healing well.
Her WBC was 28K and she was treated with Zosyn, Flagyl and Ceftriaxone.
She also had thrombocytosis and aspirin was started on a daily basis.
They recommended that her amiodarone be discontinued and eventually diltiazem could be converted to long acting.
Her J tube feedings have continued and are cycled over 14 hours.
She tolerates them well and is capable of administering her own feedings and flushing the tube correctly.
Her J tube site is clean and her port sites are well healed.
She does have some episodes of anxiety and has required occasional Ativan which is very effective.
Her incisional pain is minimal and she is taking minimal narcotics so that constipation will not be an issue.
She will continue her cyclic tube feedings along with a soft diet and she will keep a log of her oral intake so that her feedings can be adjusted at her first clinic visit.
