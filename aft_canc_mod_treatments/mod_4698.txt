She was recently on prednisone 8mg daily and developed sore throat and cough 09/[**2112**].
Steroid dose was increased to 20mg with quick taper and she was started on levofloxacin.
Despite the levofloxacin and continuation of atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis, she had increasing dyspnea and presented to [**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center on [**2113-8-29**].
Initially, concern was for cardiac cause for her dyspnea (she has a history of CABG in [**2105**]).
CXR showed RLL consolidation and she was started on vancomycin/zosyn/azithromycin ([**2113-9-5**] is day 5).
She was initially on heparin gtt but developed thrombocytopenia with plts dropping from >100k on admission to 58k.
IVC filter was placed; she was started on bivalrudin and transitioned to fondaparinux prior to transfer.
Bronchoscopy was performed after pt was intubated and revealed thick mucoid secretions.
Prednisone had initially been continued at 20mg, but then uptitrated to prednisone 60mg (and converted to solumedrol 40mg IV BID) after d/w heme-onc here for concern of GVHD.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
- [**9-/2105**]: Started Gleevec 400 mg daily.
At some point thereafter, her dose was increased to 600 mg daily - [**12/2107**]: Gleevec increased to 400 mg twice daily with hydroxyurea and allopurinol - [**2108-1-24**]: Seen at [**Hospital6 8865**], found to be  in late chronic phase CML.
Stem cell transplant was recommended, but she did not wish to pursue this course.

A mid-cavitary gradient is identified.
Note: Section showed myofibers with prominent inflammatory infiltrate composed of foamy macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells.
The findings would be consistent with GVH myositis in the clinical context of CML status post alloSCT and history of GI and liver GVH disease.
GVH myositis is indistinguishable histologically from sporatic polymyositis.
R forearm: pending at time of discharge   Brief Hospital Course: 58-year-old female with CAD s/p CABG, accelerated phase CML s/p allo SCT [**2112-4-6**] complicated by upper and lower GI GVHD [**2112-4-25**] and liver GVHD [**8-/2112**] presenting from OSH electively intubated for hypoxic and hypercarbic failure in the setting of myopathy.
# Hypercarbic hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt was initially electively intubated given diffuse myopathy affecting respiratory muscles.
Pt was managed on endotracheal intubation for 11 days before being trached on [**9-15**].
Goal now for weaning her from the vent is treatment of her diffuse myositis to improve respiratory failure in the long term with gentle weaning to trach collar.
# Motor weakness: Based on muscle biopsy, inflammation is consistent with GVHD.
Muscle biopsy shows impressive inflammation despite having been on steriods prior to biopsy.
Following muscle biopsy, she was started on cyclosporine 25mg IV BID and received 1 dose of IVIG.
Her CBC has been stable and she has not required any recent transfusions.
They were drained and per derm, continued with light pressure dressings to prevent re-accumulation.
# Hypertension: Pt has history of hypertension and had been managed at home on amlodipine 5mg, and metoprolol succinate 300mg daily.
She has been stable on amlodipine 5mg daily, metoprolol tartrate 100mg q6hr, and captopril 12.5mg TID.
# DVT: Pt has bilateral DVT, however in setting of diffuse ecchymoses and hematomas, heparin drip was held.
She was placed on compression stockings to avoid further complications of thrombophlebitis.
# elevated PTT: Unclear etiology since patient has been off heparin drip for 1 week now.
She is still getting heparin SQ TID and suspect that given decreased muscle mass, she may be supratheraputic from SQ heparin alone.
Further work up is pending, including [**Doctor First Name **], anti-cardiolipin antibody, and anti-lupus antibody.
# CML s/p allogeneic stem cell tx: Pt was continued on acyclovir and atovaquone for prophylaxis.
She has been started on cyclosporin and IVIG for diffuse myositis.
# CAD: s/p CABG in [**2104**].
She will require repeat IVIG either [**9-29**] or [**10-16**] per rheumatology recs.
