Treated with 4 L NS, vanco 1g IV, ceftazadime 1g IV, and flagyl 500mg IV.
Received 0.5 mg ativan and 2mg IV morphine for agitation.
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she completed a 10-day course of ceftazadime and vancomycin for urosepsis.
A 7-day course of metronidazole was also completed for empiric treatment of C. Diff given loose stools in the setting of an elevated WBC count, although all C. Diff assays were negative.
On the floor, however, pt experienced an episode of new Afib with RVR to 160s and hypotension to SBP 90-100s, as well as respiratory distress after she received fluid resuscitation.
There was also a concern for tachy-brady syndrome because she had pauses up to 4 sec on telemetry; EP curbside, however, felt digoxin was not recommended.
While in the MICU, she was started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam as she had (1) sites of possible infection at the erosions under her breasts and on her right hip, as well as question of PNA, (2) rising WBC, reaching a high of nearly 17.
MICU course was also marked by (1) hypotension, which responded to gentle NS boluses; (2) low UOP believed to be [**2-22**] both hypovolemia and a low baseline nitrogenous load/obligate urine output; and (3) recurrent Afib, for which she was transitioned to amiodarone 400mg PO daily, to run for 7 days before titrating downward.
Past Medical History: # Nodular sclerosing Hodgkins Lymphoma ([**3-/2188**]) --Presentation: Inguinal lymphadenopathy, treated with local radiotherapy initially with good results.
--CT [**8-23**]: Progression, treated with Cytoxan, Velban and Prednisone with a good response --Eroding mass at sacrum, treated with radiation therapy --[**3-/2191**]: Severe hypoxemia, somnolence, and generalized edema, with anasarca responsive to diuresis and oxygen supplements, and discharged on constant oxygen --[**3-/2191**]: CVVP trial, stopped in [**10-28**] because of low blood counts --Low-dose modified regimen: Chlorambucil 4mg daily for days [**1-27**], Procarbazine 50mg daily for days [**1-27**], Velban 10 mg IV on day 1 only, Neulasta 6mg on day 8.
--[**9-/2192**]: Chemotherapy discontinued given poor response --[**1-/2193**]: L sided chest pain with lytic lesions in the thoracic vertebrae; received radiation therapy to T6-T8 including the right 7th rib --CT [**8-/2193**]: Interval decrease in vertebral lesions.
NEURO: Sleepy but arousable.
NEURO: Sleepy but arousable.
On [**2194-1-21**] the patient was made DNR/DNI but the family continued to want ICU transfers and pressors if needed, regardless of comfort to the patient.
She was started on levophed for hypotension but eventually a decision was made that it was medically futile to escalate care.
# Afib with RVR: Pt experienced transient episodes of Afib to 150's controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, with spontaneous conversion but with multiple episodes of up to 4 second pauses and bradycardia to 40, likely junctional escape.
In the MICU, pt was started on amiodarone gtt, and converted to amiodarone PO.
Will continue to trend platelets, transfuse for bleeding or platelet count < 10.
Transfused 1 unit platelets with good bump on [**1-25**].
Also, the patient has been receiving pRBC transfusions for HCT <24 (total of four units since [**2194-1-12**]).
# Hypotension: Early on in the admission, she was having hypotensive episodes after furosemide but was responsive to fluid blosues of 250 cc.
Once no longer fluid responsive, she was started on phenylephrine gtt, which was weaned off.
She was started on levophed but a decision was then made to not escalate care.
Vanc and piptaz started on [**1-22**]; cultures of blood and urine pending; sputum not obtainable at this point.
CDiff repeated with toxin B.
C Diff neg, thus D/C flagyl [**1-24**].
# Respiratory Distress: Early in her admission, the patient developed labored breathing after receiving 1 L NS for hypotension c/w flash pulmonary edema.
Diuresis with furosemide gtt lead to hypotension; albumin resuscitation lead to repeated respiratory distress.
# Hypothyroidism:  Initially treated with levothyroxine 12.5 mcg IV daily (half home dose).
Diuresis has been difficult due to hypotension as detailed above.
# Urosepsis: Admitted with hypotension due to urosepsis requiring pressor support.
Urine cultures from [**1-9**] were positive for E.coli, and pt completed treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime x10 days.
The patient's pain is being controlled with fentanyl and lidocaine patches.
# Nodular Sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Seen by oncology, no interventions at this time.
