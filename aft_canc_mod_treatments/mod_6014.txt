HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62 year old female with pancreatic carcinoma originally admitted to the hospital on [**2112-2-28**], with complaints of nausea, vomiting and dizziness.
She had been started on Ampicillin, Gentamicin and Flagyl for Klebsiella urosepsis versus cholangitis on [**2-29**].
During her Intensive Care Unit course, the patient had four out of four blood cultures positive for Klebsiella and had a percutaneous nephrostomy to relieve left hydronephrosis and an Emergency Room CT scan which was negative for cholangitis.
The patient was treated for Klebsiella bacteremia in the Intensive Care Unit and had a left lower lobe pneumonia, and was started on Ceftriaxone and Flagyl.
She received aggressive chest Physical Therapy and nebulizers to allow for this but had a persistent O2 requirement upon transfer back to the floor on [**3-6**].
On [**3-7**], her antibiotics were changed to a broader spectrum, Zosyn/Vancomycin, and she continued to become more hypoxemic.
Her oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 150**] saw her on the floor and was reluctant to start palliative chemotherapy until her infection issues were resolved.
Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously three times a day.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Vancomycin one gram intravenous q.
Zosyn 4.5 mg intravenously q. six, day three.
MSIR 50 mg q. four to six hours p.r.n.
Ativan 0.5 mg p.r.n.
Zofran 4 mg intravenously q. six hours p.r.n.
Albuterol p.r.n.
Neck with right internal jugular catheter in place.
Back with no costovertebral angle tenderness; left nephrostomy in place.
Calcium 7.5, phosphorus 2.6, magnesium 1.6, albumin 2.3.
ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient was initially hypoxemic believed to be secondary to congestive heart failure in the setting of aggressive volume resuscitation with sepsis.
The patient's initial lactates were in the 2 range and she was given one unit of packed red blood cells for her low hematocrit.
She had a persistent O2 requirement in the Intensive Care Unit and was on a nonrebreather mask for two days, however, with diuresis and antibiotics she was able to avoid intubation and in fact be weaned on her high flow face mask very slowly.
The patient was initiated on aggressive chest Physical Therapy as well as suctioning.
She was able to provide sputum which did not grow out anything and after diuresis she did well.
The patient also had Gentamicin initially started upon transfer to the unit, however, this was discontinued along with AmBisome on [**3-11**] and the MUST protocol was discontinued on [**3-10**] as she was afebrile, her blood pressure stable and her lactate was only 1.2.
The patient was noted to become hypotensive acutely after morphine administration.
A Fentanyl patch was started for pain control with p.r.n.
PANCREATIC CANCER:   The patient achieved pain control with morphine p.r.n.
Palliative chemotherapy was not an option given her infectious issues and the patient's family initially wanted her to be a full code with aggressive care.
Her INR was elevated to a high of 1.6, however, dropped back down to 1.3 after 5 mg of Vitamin K subcutaneously.
By the time of discharge, the patient was started on TPN and was kept on TPN throughout the unit stay.
LEFT PICC LINE AND A-LINE:  Right IJ triple lumen catheter was pulled once a left PICC line was placed and tip sent for culture which never grew out anything.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:   Urine culture positive for yeast on [**3-9**]; the Foley catheter was replaced and a recheck of urinalysis was negative.
Repeat urine cultures did not grow out anything and so she was not started on any anti-fungals for this.
However, she did have a positive yeast infection by clinical examination and was on three days of miconazole intravaginal suppositories.
The patient was started on Ritalin empirically to treat depression and fatigue and malaise while in the Intensive Care Unit.
