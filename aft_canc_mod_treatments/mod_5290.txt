Post-surgical changes following prior right frontal craniotomy are again noted.
IMPRESSION: There has been marked interval expansion in the right frontal mass with both cystic regions and solid enhancement and marked associated mass effect.
The findings are highly concerning for aggressive tumor recurrence, though the possibility of radiation necrosis cannot be excluded.
The patient is status post repeat right frontal craniotomy with extensive post-surgical changes, including marked right frontal pneumocephalus, both intra- and extra-axial, as on the CT obtained one day previously.
Remainder of the examination is notable only for fluid- opacification of mastoid air cells, right more than left; the opacified right mastoid apex was present on the [**5-9**] study, while that on the left is new, some of which may relate to intubation and/or supine positioning.
Status post recent repeat right frontal craniotomy, with expected post-surgical changes at this site, including a relatively thin right frontal polar subdural fluid collection with no significant mass effect, as well as extensive pneumocephalus.
Expected dural enhancement at the operative bed, with no pathologic focus of enhancement elsewhere.
