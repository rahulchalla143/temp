Of note, she has a hx of PE diagnosed in [**2158**] and has been on coumadin since that time.
She had held her coumadin 4 days prior to a lymph node biopsy on [**2-10**].
The coumadin was restarted the day after the biopsy, and on that day she noted redness and swelling in her RLE.
The thought was that it likely occurred while she was off her coumadin, so it was not considered a treatment failure and she was continued on her coumdain, as she was appropriately therapeutic.
Vascular surgery was consulted and plans to place an IVC filter tomorrow morning.
