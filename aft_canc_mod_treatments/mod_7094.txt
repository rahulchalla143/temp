He underwent surgical excision and there was malignant alteration with increased cellularity and single cell necrosis and extensive multifocal tissue necrosis with large diffusely infiltrating histologic benign component typical of required reoperation.
At that time he had radiation therapy carried out near his home at [**Hospital3 44339**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 45098**], [**State 2748**].
He underwent focal radiation at [**Hospital3 28333**] [**Hospital3 **].
The overall recommendation of radiation therapy was to reoperate and remove this area rather than consider any further high energy beam radiation at this time.
MEDICATIONS:  He was taking Zantac each day and 200 mg of Tegretol four times a day.
Tegretol dose was increased from 800 to 1000mg per day.
He was kept on 4 mg of Decadron four times per day for the first four days postoperatively and then started on a Decadron taper on the day of discharge, lowing his dosage by 0.5 mg each day, so that on the day of discharge he was to receive 3.5 mg on a four times per day basis, the day following that 3.0 mg dose of Decadron four times per day and then taper carried out through the next several weeks.
He had a Tegretol level post-op that was in the 5 range and his Tegretol dose was increased to five 100 mg tablets per day.
