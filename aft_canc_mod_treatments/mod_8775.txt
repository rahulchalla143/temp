At that time, she underwent left needle-localized lumpectomy, sentinel node biopsy, and low axillary dissection.
Due to wheezing, she was treated with albuterol as an outpatient, but that did not seem to help.
The patient was given levofloxacin and vancomycin due to concern for infection.
She was guaiac negative, but head CT showed an abnormality for which the differential included subarachnoid hemorrhage, so heparin was not started.

# [**6-13**] CT head: Abnormal gyriform hyperdensity in the left frontal lobe of uncertain etiology in the setting of prior intravenous contrast administration, but the differential diagnosis includes abnormal enhancement associated with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, possibly with a parenchymal mass or edema; although unlikely, it is not possible to exclude hemorrhage.
# [**6-14**] MRI w and w/o contrast: CONCLUSION:  Left frontal and right parietal enhancing lesions appear most likely to be subacute infarction, with the right parietal lesion more recentthan the left frontal.
The 1st more superior and superficial collection in subdermal location, measures 5 cm in transverse and 2 cm deep.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was guaiac negative, but head CT showed an abnormality for which the differential included subarachnoid hemorrhage, so initiation of heparin was deferred and pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Neurology felt it was safe to start anticoagulation so she was started on Lovenox.
Pt was not interested in Coumadin monitoring so she was continued on Lovenox.
She was quickly weaned off oxygen and was satting in mid to high 90s on room air at time of discharge.
The concern is that her new diagnosis of CHF may have been secondary to chemotherapy she received for recent diagnosis of breast cancer.
She was started on Valsartan and low dose aspirin and will follow up with cardiology as an outpatient.
Consider spironolactone and beta blocker once stable to medically optimize, although anticipate cardiomyopathy may reverse when Adriamycin is complete and these medications may not be necessary.
She was initially started on Keflex for presumed cellulitis, however the patient was afebrile and without leukocytosis so Keflex was discontinued.
Her factor X level was checked given that patient was on Lovenox and there was concern that if she was supratherapeutic, it may be contributing to bleeding within her recent surgical site.
She was continued on her pravastatin and aspirin and will need a repeat MRI as an outpatient in [**1-6**] months.
# neuropathy: Pt complained of recent onset lower extremity tingling, concerning for chemotherapy induced neuropathy.
She was started on low dose gabapentin during this admission and this can be increased as necessary as an outpatient.
CHRONIC ISSUES" # Breast cancer: Staged as 2B s/p treatment with Adriamycin and cyclophosphamide, Taxol, and weekly Herceptin, needle-localized lumpectomy, sentinel node biopsy, and low axillary dissection with pleural effusion negative for malignancy.
Her further chemotherapy options may be limited as pt appeared to develop CHF in setting of active chemotherapy.
# T2DM:  Pt was on metformin at home, though this was held while in house.
Her blood sugar was controlled with insulin 75/25 as well as sliding scale insulin.
Her insulin dose was decreased during this hospitalization given low blood sugars.
Her metformin was resumed on discharge.
# She will need to establish care with cardiology as an outpatient for continued adjustment of medications given her new diagnosis of heart failure.
# Pt will need to follow with surgery regarding her left axillary seroma.
