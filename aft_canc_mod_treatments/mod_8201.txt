On [**2166-10-9**], the patient underwent pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy with en bloc resection of superior mesenteric vein, superior mesenteric vein primary venorrhaphy (end-to-end), and CyberKnife fiducial placements, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
Of note, a Left subclavian line was placed with a post-placement CXR that showed a Large left sided Pneumothorax.
A pigtail catheter chest tube was placed and eventually, the lung fully expanded.
The chest tube was then removed with post-removal CXR showing continued expansion of the lung.
After being stabilized in the unit for a couple days, the patient arrived on the floor NPO on IV fluids, with a foley catheter and a JP drain in place, and an epidural for pain control.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was uneventful except for the need for a chest tube placement (see above) and followed the Whipple Clinical Pathway without deviation.
Post-operative pain was initially well controlled with an epidural, which was converted to oral pain medication when tolerating clear liquids.
The NG tube was discontinued on POD#3, and the foley catheter discontinued at midnight of POD#4.
The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay.
