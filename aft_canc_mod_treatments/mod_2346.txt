Her stool was subsequently found to be positive for C. difficile, and she was started on a course of Flagyl.
With failure of her diarrheal symptoms to resolve and a persistently elevated white blood count, the patient was also treated with oral vancomycin per the Infectious Disease Department's recommendations.
On [**2113-2-8**], she was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.
The Hematology/Oncology service was consulted, and in accordance with the patient's decision to pursue aggressive treatment, they recommended local excision and a treatment of chemotherapy with 5-FU and leucovorin.
The patient got 5 mg of intravenous vancomycin x 2 for an elevated INR.
Antibiotics were expanded on [**2-11**] to include ampicillin.
A PICC line was placed that day, complicated by two seven-beat runs of ventricular tachycardia secondary to instrumentation of the atrium or ventricle.
The patient also had a question left bundle branch block pattern of 30 seconds duration while undergoing PICC line placement.
For low blood pressure, the patient was bolused with normal saline 500 cc x 2 that afternoon.
While in the CT scanner, she complained of increased respiratory distress and was ultimately intubated and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
History of tonsillectomy 3.
Morbid obesity  MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER: 1.
Levaquin 500 mg by mouth once daily 2.
Colace 3.

Flagyl 1 gram intravenously every six hours 6.
Ampicillin 2 grams intravenously every four hours 7.
Tylenol as needed  HOME MEDICATIONS:  The patient was on pain medications for her osteoarthritis.
Ventilator settings:  SIMV with pressure support of 5, tidal volume 600, respiratory rate 20, PEEP of 5, FIO2 of 1.
Her blood pressure initially responded to volume and low-dose dopamine.
She was bolused aggressively with intravenous fluids, and was 14 liters positive by the end of her hospital stay.
She was initially transitioned from dopamine to Levophed.
Dobutamine was later added for inotropic support, and vasopressin for additional blood pressure support.
The patient was placed on a ventilator and maintained good oxygenation and ventilation.
Infectious Disease:  The patient presented with overwhelming sepsis as described above.
Although she had wanted aggressive treatment, including local resection and chemotherapy, she had a likely life expectancy of approximately one year.
She had been transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.
She was also treated while on the floor for C. difficile colitis with Flagyl and later with oral vancomycin.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, she was on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover possible abdominal vs. biliary process with ampicillin, gentamicin and Flagyl.
