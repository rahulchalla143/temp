Occasional target cells and spherocytes are seen.
Occasional myelocyte and metamyelocyte seen on scan.
Myeloid precursors appear markedly increased in number and show left-shifted maturation.
An IV catheter is seen in the dorsal soft tissues next to the fifth metacarpal.
A right-sided PICC line is present.
Subtle changes described in the report of a [**2101-4-26**] CT scan are not appreciated on today's radiograph, question due to interval resolution versus limitations of radiographs versus CT.  [**2101-5-6**] BM cytogenetics: KARYOTYPE: 47,XY,+15,[**Doctor First Name 15**](15)(Q15Q24)[5]/46,XY[11] INTERPRETATION: Five of 16 metaphases contained an additional copy of chromosome 15 (TRISOMY 15) and an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 15.
The majority of the cellularity is comprised of stromal cells, lymphocytes and reactive plasma cells.
Scattered clusters of hemosiderin-laden macrophages are seen.
There are, however, two large lymph nodes in the ileocolic region of uncertain significance.
Leukopheresis was not performed given no signs of leukostasis.
Bone marrow biopsy was completed on admission and showed ...  Hydroxyurea was started on admission, and then discontinued once 7+3 chemotherapy was begun the following day.
Transthoracic echocardiogram was completed on admission prior to chemotherapy dosing.
There is a question of prostatis on imaging but without any clinical symptoms and with all urine cultures incl chlamydia being negative, but regardless was started on meropenem.
There is also a question of a bone in his appendix, but upon review with rads, this could be an appendicolith which may cause appendicitis when his white count recovers.
ENT was curbsided and wo evidence of mastoiditis pt was not candidate for surgical intervention or drainage.
He was treated with Afrin x 3 days with resolution of the pain attributed to congestion and otitis.
Micafungin (started for febrile neutropenia) was dc'd [**5-20**] and vanco/[**Last Name (un) 2830**] was dc'd on [**5-21**].
He started levofloxacin for otitis media coverage after discontinuing broad spectrum abx.
Aggressive IV fluid administration was undertaken.
Patient was started on allopurinol and was given one dose of rasburicase prior to chemotherapy administration to for tumor lysis prophylaxis.
Patient was also started on calcium carbonate to bind phosphrous.
Patient required two units of FFP prior to central line placement.
His INR has been elevated so he has received 3 courses of vitamin K 5mg PO x3 days.
There was no history of lung disease, and symptom was not associated with chest pain or palpitations.
A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed before chemotherapy administration which showed no gross abnormalities of heart function.
# Otitis: no evidence of mastoiditis on CT. ENT curbsided and recommended treatment with afrin.
Pt had resolution of jaw pain, pt had continued congestion and "muffled hearing" that will likely resolve slowly in next few weeks.
