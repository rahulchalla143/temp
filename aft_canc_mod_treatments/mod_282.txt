[**2162-9-2**] Blood Cultures pending  Brief Hospital Course: 76yo M PMHx recent arthroscopic knee surgery 1d prior to presentation, recent cystoscopy 9d prior to presentation, presenting w fever to 104.1, hypotension  # Hypotension / Sepsis - Patient presented with hypotension, fever, tachycardia, meeting SIRS criteria, on review of likely infection sources, UA appearing most likely source, especially given recent cystoscopy 1wk prior to presentation, although would lung and knee s/p arthroscopy were also considered.
He was covered empirically with Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin and Meropenem.
He required norepinephrine in ED but was off norepinephrine in MICU with MAP >65.
Hypotension was considered [**2-10**] sepsis and he responded to 500cc fluid boluses.
On the floor, his vancomycin was discontinued as his infection was felt likely to be due to a UTI.
Of note while on floor patient had episodes of asymptomatic Sys BP to 80s overnight after being fluid diuresed for flash pulmonary edema after surgey (see L femoral neck fracture section) During first episode patient was given fluid boluses with response.
The patient was continued on ciprofloxacin and meropenem and a second urine culture was negative for growth.
The patient finished his 10 day course of ciprofloxacin and meropenem on [**2162-9-6**].
# Elevated Troponin - Pt never had chest pain but w troponins elevated in ED in setting of sinus tachycardia; EKG w ST depressions in V4-V5; no prior cardiac history, likely demand ischemia in setting of tachycardia, hypotension, chronic kidney disease; no suspicion for STEMI.
He was started on Aspirin and Trops peaked at 0.28 before trending down to 0.04.
During surgery the patient received 1700mL, as well as blood products and the patient developed shortness of breath and an oxygen requirement from pulmonary edema as evidenced on CXR, he was sent to the MICU and diuresed with improvement of symptoms and transferred to the floor over night.
The patient continued to be diuresed on the floor and was weaned off of oxygen to room air on [**2162-9-3**].
The patient also complained of pain at hip after surgery, Pain service was consulted and a pain regimen was instituted with standing oxycontin, oxycodone PRN, and dilaudid for breakthrough pain.
Patient continued on Fludrocortisone, Baclofen, Gabapentin continued however at lower dose for concern for hypotension and lethargy.
Propanolol continued at lower dose than home medication.

In preparation for surgery, the coumadin was stopped the day prior to surgery, the patient was also given vitamin K. He was also given FFP by the orthopedics team for the surgery.
The patient was placed on prophylactic lovenox after surgery and his warfarin was restarted.
Once INR was at therapeutic levels, lovenox was discontinued.
However, his INR was supratherapeutic at day of discharge (4.2) likely [**2-10**] to ciprofloxacin interaction.
His warfarin was held at discharge and INR should be monitored with warfarin adjusted accordingly.
