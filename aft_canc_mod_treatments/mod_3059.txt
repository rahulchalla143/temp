Her original presentation was with a right axillary lymph node enlargement, fatigue, weight loss, and night sweats.
She was stage 4B given her thoracic abdominal axillary and pulmonary lymphadenopathies with metastases.
She had a left cephalic vein Port-A-Cath placed on [**2119-1-4**].
She subsequently underwent ice chemotherapy consisting of ice-phos, bromide, mesna, carboplatin, and VP16 on [**1-10**] through 19 due to disease recurrence as visualized on the PET scan.
She was thus discharged on Augmentin for a question of sinusitis.
On the Emergency Room presentation, the patient had an ultrasound showing occlusion of her left subclavian vein with extensive thromboses over her bilateral internal jugulars which extended to her right atrium, however, no clot in the right atrium.
Vascular Surgery and Interventional Radiology were emergently consulted for plans for lysis and patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for further management.
Hodgkin's disease diagnosed [**2118-7-25**], nodular sclerosing subtype, stage 4B, originally treated with [**Location (un) 11916**] 5 chemotherapy with subsequent patch showing progression of disease, most recently on ice chemotherapy with plans for auto bone marrow transplant in two months.
Bactrim DS 3 times a week.
Patient recently had a Port-A-Cath placed and it was thought that her thrombosis was most likely a Port-A-Cath associated clot.
Originally, Radiology planned for a catheter directed thrombolysis.
Following a venogram through her Port-A-Cath to further characterize the clot, the patient had a TPA bolus injected into the thrombosis in the angiography laboratory and she subsequently had a TPA infusion into the clot.
The patient had a PIC line placed and then the Port-A-Cath was removed.
She was maintained on a heparin drip immediately to maintain anticoagulation.
Plan is to continue patient on Lovenox most likely for several months, however, her platelets and other blood counts will have to be monitored carefully in the setting of her underlying malignancy and chemotherapy.
It is thought that, being that her clot occurred in the context of catheter, she will be a decreased risk following catheter removal.
In addition, patient was on oral contraceptives at the time of admission and this was subsequently discontinued.
Hodgkin's lymphoma:  Patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed [**Month (only) **] of the previous year, status post [**Location (un) 20180**] 5 chemotherapy with recurrent disease.
Patient was already started on Neupogen prior to admission for her neutropenia following chemotherapy.
She was maintained on Neupogen through the hospital admission with plans to continue this until her neutropenia resolved.
Her long-term plans include a bone marrow transplant in the next few months following additional chemotherapy.
Infectious disease:  Patient was maintained on Bactrim and Acyclovir prophylaxis as per her outpatient regimen and was discharged on the same.
Bactrim DS 3 times a week.
Acyclovir 400 mg twice a day.
Neupogen 400 micrograms once daily, duration to be determined by her primary oncologist.
Lovenox 100 mg subcutaneous once daily.
Percocet as needed.
Heparin flush for patient-controlled analgesia pump as directed.
Normal saline flush for PIC line as directed.
She is to follow-up with her home nursing for PIC line care as per protocol.
