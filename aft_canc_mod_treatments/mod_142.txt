In the ED, she was placed on a non-rebreather with sats up to the high 90's.
Given that, she received levofloxacin and vancomycin.
Blood cultures were drawn prior to antibiotic administration.
Sats were 97% on 5L NC and 95% high-flow with a face-tent.

CXR: [**2-13**] SINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Patient is status post median sternotomy.
After review of multiple recent prior chest x-rays and CTs, these findings can all be explained by worsening bronchioalveolar carcinoma, given the absence of any change rapid enough to suggest pneumonia.
Of course pneumonia might be present and unrecognized, and treatment should be made on the basis of clinical findings.
On admission she was placed on NRB for treatment of O2 saturations in 70s saturations in the 70s.
concern for infectious process and empirically treated with levofloxacin and vancomycin in the ED.
Transitioned to monotherapy with levofloxacin on [**2-14**] and ceftriaxone was later added on [**2-15**].
Patient was able to be weaned back to room air by the end of her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.
Consolidation of left lower lobe evident on [**2-15**] likely secondary to infection rather than progression of disease due to short time course of infiltrate development (although on CT scan of [**2167-2-16**], the radiologist concluded the opposite: that changes seen were likely caused by her NSCLC, though pneumonia could not be absolutely ruled out).
Continued course of ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, which was eventually narrowed to levofloxacin alone.
Outpatient oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is planning on continued surveillance with plan for possible further palliative systemic chemotherapy if symptomatic progression of her disease is noted.
He plans to repeat her CT scan once she completes her antibiotics to further evaluate the rate of disease progression.
Patient continued on home beta-blocker at a decreased dose due to relative hypotension.
As described below, lasix was held but B-blocker was given at a lower dose given relative hypotension and exertional tachycardia.
She was given minimal IV fluids in the ICU and her lasix was held.

You were treated with antibiotics and oxygen and improved, and you were tranferred to the medical floor.
We communicated with your primary oncologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who will weigh the risks and benefits of additional chemotherapy, as it will be complicated by your kidney dysfunction and other medical problems.
Please note we stopped your lasix and amlodipine for now, and you will need to be re-evaluated by your PCP to see when you should restart them.
