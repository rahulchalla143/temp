_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ________________________________________________________________ Mr. [**Known lastname 88840**] care was transferred to the Acute Care team on [**2148-6-21**] when he was taken urgently to the OR for left hemicolectomy with primary anastomosis; biopsies were obtained of the mass in his sigmoid.
Postoperatively he was  returned to [**Location 10115**] intubated, paralyzed, and on neo drip which was able to be weaned off.
He was also noted with tachycardia and was given extra metoprolol.
Cardiology was consulted who recommended diuresis and continuing beta blockade.
He required intermittent IV fluid bolus' with normal saline for which he adequately responded.
Following the 3rd trigger event there was concern again for anastomosis leak and he underwent CT imaging of his abdomen which did not show any leaking; it did however show a possible stricture at the anastomosis.
His subcutaneous Heparin was stopped and a HIT panel was sent which came back positive.
Argatroban was started and adjusted per his PTT.
Cardiology was re-consulted and his Lasix was recommended to be stopped while continuing his beta blockade.
He was also given additional 250 ml NS fluid bolus following his Lasix being stopped.
Cardioversion was also being recommended but at the time was being deferred as an outpatient.
His Coumadin was also recommended to be started with parameters for adjusting and eventually stopping the Argatroban.
The Argatroban drip was eventually stopped and he was given 5mg Coumadin; initial dose on [**7-4**] for several doses, his INR was 1.5 on [**7-8**].
He was noted with hematuria on [**7-6**] requiring that a Foley be replaced for irrigation and monitoring purposes - this did resolve; his hematocrit remained stable with 30 being the last value on [**7-8**].
The Foley was removed and he was able to void.
Cardiology was re-consulted and recommended Lasix 40 mg every other day; they further noted that his albumin was likely contributing to his edema as well.
Physical and Occupational therapy evaluations concluded that he would require acute rehab after his hospital stay.
