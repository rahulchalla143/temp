[**2131-2-24**] EGD w/ stent  A fistula was found in the lower esophagus.
There was a deep fistula at approximately 35cm with upstream ulceration and visible suture material.
The GE junction is located at approximately 47cm Successful placement of a 20Fr [**Company 2267**] traction PEG tube using the standard pull technique.
Successful insertion of a 23mm x 155mm fully covered metal esophagal stent [REF 1675, LOT [**Numeric Identifier 41706**]] under fluoroscopic guidance, with the middle of the stent positioned over the fistula, and the bottom of the stent above the GE junction.
[**2131-3-15**] CXR FINDINGS: Multifocal pneumonia including dense right lower lobe consolidation with abscess has not really changed much since [**2131-3-13**].
Tracheostomy tube is in standard position  [**2131-3-12**] CT chest IMPRESSION: 1.
Pigtail catheter appears in appropriate position inside the collection.
Tube patency cannot be assessed.
[**2131-2-28**] esophagus 1.
No evidence for leak around the esophageal stent, only the distal two-thirds were fully evaluated.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 41707**] is a 49 y/o man with a h/o well controlled HIV on Atripla, EtOH abuse, and recent esophageal rupture s/p surgical repair on [**2131-1-1**] at and OSH c/b persistent leak who presented in septic shock to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2131-2-23**] with large necrotizing lung abscess [**1-11**] esophageal-pleural fistula.
He was empirically started on Vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]/Mica and had an esophageal stent placed [**2131-2-24**].
He slowly improved, weaning off pressors, though required trachetomy [**2131-3-7**] for prolonged ventilation and then weaned to trachmask.
Surgery for the patient's collection was discussed but due to the parenchymal (rather than pleural) nature of his collection it was felt he may require pneumonectomy but did not likely have pulmonary reserve for this large operation, additionally with risk to re-opening his esophageal perforation or disrupting his pulmonary vasculature.
He eventually underwent IR guided drainage with pigtail drain that helped his clinical status somewhat but the fluid was loculated so could not be drained much.
Summary of events: [**2-23**]: Transferred from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, intubated; central line placed and pressors started in ED.
Empiric antibiotics started (Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/Mica--not Fluconazole given prolonged QTc); bronchoscopy performed with BAL sent.
-[**2-25**]: Desaturation to 90% w/ mild-moderate improvement following suctioning of copious secretions.
had planned to g-tube study, held meds and TF via PEG.
-[**2-27**]: Given persistent copious secretions, bronchoscopy performed with visualized moderate loose, milky secretions.
-[**2-28**]: MAP <65 in afternoon, restarted on levophed (stopped at 23:00) and infused 1uPRBC.
Fentanyl discontinued, and pt transitioned to Tylenol, dilaudid.
-[**3-3**]: bronched, BAL sent; placed on CMV afterwards due to resp distress w/ goal to wean back to CPAP in am, propofol added for intermittent hypertension/tachycardia -[**3-4**]: ID consulted and agreed with current antibiotics/antifungal although they believe that definitive treatment is right pneumonectomy but patient is not a good candidate surgically; Thoracic surgery decided to do bedside trach on [**3-5**]; consents obtained; throughout the day patient would intermittently become agitated/tachypneic resulting in mild desaturation so fentanyl gtt was added to his sedation regimen -[**3-5**]: Bedside bronch and trach, CT chest, TFs resumed, HLIV, weaned levophed; febrile 102.1 - cx sent; -[**3-6**]: R PICC placed; to IR [**3-7**] for drainage of right lung abscess; spiked fever overnight, no new cultures drawn -[**3-7**]: IP did not find a safe spot for US guided drainage- would need CT guided drainage, fever to 101.7, not cultured -[**3-8**]: went to CT-guided drainage although very little was drained ~20ml, sent for cultures; patient tolerated procedure well; per ID consult: sent for B-glucan and Aspergillus Galactomannan Antigen -[**3-9**]: d/c'd fent/prop gtt; started oxycodone, ativan, morphine breakthrough; C. diff sent, loperamide d/c'd - [**3-10**]: weaned peep to 10; - [**3-11**]: afebrile, spent the entire day on trach collar - stable, ambulated with PT/OT, sat in chair - [**3-12**]: afebrile, PT/OT OOB to chair, ID rec'd CT chest and Bld cx x 3, continue current abtx and drainage per thoracic.
Case management to eval for rehab facility.
From a GI standpoint he was tolerating his tube feedings but the preparation was changed to Nepro as he had persistent elevated potassium in the 6 range.
A speech and swallow study was done on [**2131-3-20**] for placement of a PMV (as he had a cuffless trach tube in place).
He tolerated it well and also was started on a diet of thin liquids and pureed solids.
Unfortunately he appeared to aspirate and was made NPO and his trach tube was changed to cuffed.
Cipro was added to his antibiotic therapy and a chest xray showed some increased opacities in the RUL and LLL.
He has gradually improved with pulmonary toilet and antibiotic therapy and hid trach tube was downsized to a #6 portex, cuffed tube on [**2131-3-25**].
The Infectious Disease service is following him closely and recommends 4 weeks of therapy with Micafungin and Ertapenum (or Meropenum 500 mg q6hrs).
The stop date is [**2131-4-5**] for those antibiotics and the stop date for the Cipro is [**2131-3-28**].
The Nutrition service currently recommends changeing his tube feedings to 2 cal HN at 40/hr now that his potassium is in the 4.0 range.
On [**2131-4-16**] his esophageal stent will be removed and he will be admitted to the hospital following that for further management.

Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2131-2-22**], after complications from esophageal surgery [**2131-1-1**] at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital.
You were very sick and required ICU management for weeks.
Your breathing was compromised and you need a tracheostoomy tube along with a feeding tube to maintain your nutrition.
You will also need long term antibiotics and for that reason, a PICC line was placed.
* Your trach tube will eventually come out.
* On [**2131-4-16**] the esophageal stent will be removed and you will be admitted to the hospital after the procedure for further management.
You will be admitted to the hospital after the procedure to the Thoracic Surgery service...Dr. [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
