For example, two adjacent right paratracheal nodes measure 16 x 12 and 15 x 13 mm in axial dimensions, respectively.
More superiorly, a right upper paratracheal lymph node measures 15 x 13 mm, and a subcarinal node measures 28 x 17 mm.
The heart, great vessels, and pericardium are unremarkable.
Diffuse patchy ground glass opacities and septal thickening in the right lung, progressive over two days, which may represent pulmonary edema, given its rapid onset.
Given the temporal relation to chest tube placement, it was hoped that the patient was experiencing re-expansion pulmonary edema that could be improved with lasix diuresis.
Given diffuse disease evident in the lung, infiltrate could not be radiographically ruled out, so the patient was maintained on vancomycin, azithromycin and zosyn for broad coverage given her severe ilness.
On the patient's second day in the MICU, cytology returned on his efussion for NSCLC, thus stage IIIB "wet" / stage IV.
This was poorly rate controlled with IV boluses of metoprol, followed by diltiazem, so the patient was started on a diltiazem drip.
Ca and atropine were maintained at the bedside given use of multiple nodal blocking agents, but the patient never converted to sinus.
The larger MICU plan of care had been to reverse any treatable causes of shortness of breath, notably infiltrates via antiobiotics, pulmonary edema with diuretics, and COPD exacerbation with steroids, atrovent and albuterol.
Both rate control and rhythm control strategies for afib had failed.
The patient's children and medical team decided that cardioversion would not be indicated given lack of improvement to either quality of quantity of life.
Chest tube was removed.
Of note, her pleurx catheter was left in place as it was not causing discomfort and was a tunnelled line.
A morphine drip was initiated in addition to the fentanyl patch that had already been started a day before.
Fentanyl patch was not converted back to morphine given wide range of pharmacoconversion and success of current comfort regimen.
