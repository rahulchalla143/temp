Acute renal Failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardioversion times two ([**2173-11-12**] and [**2173-11-16**]) AV node ablation ([**2173-11-19**]) Pacemaker placement ([**2173-11-19**])   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] year old man with a history of prostate cancer, stroke, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who was recently discharged to [**Hospital 100**] rehab after an admission for frequent falls.
He had a history of atrial fibrillation during that recent admission; however, he was not continued on anticoagulation due to frequent falls.
?CAD: based on anterior wall motion abnormality on TTE 16.
His abdomen was soft, non-tender, nondistended, with bowel sounds present.

PMH includes: CVA [**79**] yrs ago resulting in gait ataxia and dysarthria, PAF, h/o prostate cancer, frequent falls, a question of Parkinsonism, w/recent admit ([**2173-11-1**]) for multiple recent falls and for rehab placement.
Cognition, language, speech, voice: Notably lethargic, only maintain alertness when provided with tactile or auditory stimulation routinely during the exam.
Pt's language was notable for perseverative jargon with occasional words interspersed, but not appropriate to context.
However, given effort of chewing, this may actually increase fatigue and place him at further risk for decreased po intake and falling asleep while eating.
As such, recommended ground solids at this time, but also instructed pt's wife to select some softer/pureed items from daily menus in the event pt's lethargy may make ground solids too difficult.
RECOMMENDATIONS:      1.PO diet consistency of ground solids, thin liquids.
2.PO meds as tolerated, with purees or liquids.
Atrial fibrillation was not controlled with medical medical management and the improvement of the patient's pneumonia, so the patient had AV nodal ablation and placement of a dual chamber pacemaker.
He was [**Hospital 35261**] transferred from the cardiac care unit to the medicine service for a change in mental status involving somnolence and worsened aphasia which resolved after continuation of the medication abilify.
He was loaded with IV amiodarone at the time of cardioversion.
At that time, he became hypotensive and required a dopamine drip for less than a day to maintain a MAP of 60.
He was continued on amiodarone at 400 mg twice a day with the goal on re-trying a cardioversion once he was loaded with amiodarone.
He required two shocks at 360 J to revert to sinus rhythm.
In order to improve quality of life and to decrease the number of medications, an AV node ablation was perfomed and a dual chamber pacemaker was placed on [**2173-11-19**].
Amiodarone and heparin were stopped at this time.
His pacemaker was programmed to pace at 80 bpm for the first month and he was given 48 hours of vancomycin post-procedure.
He was gently hydrated with 800 cc of IV fluids even though he had known poor left ventricular function.
He was subsequently started on a nesiritide drip due to an increase in CHF.
His acute renal failure improved with the nesiritide treatment over the course of 3 days.
He was diuresed with a nesirite drip and added IV lasix to reach a goal fluid balance of net negative 1L each day.
Once his pacemaker was placed, he was transitioned from the nesiritide drip to an oral regimen of lisinopril, furosemide, and aldactone.
Urine culture was only positive for the presence of <10,000 organsims likely representing colonization from prolonged Foley catheter placement.
The foley catheter was removed and replaced with a condom catheter to assure appropriate quantification of urine.
Although an infiltrate was not present on the initial chest x-ray, he was treated with a 10 day course of levofloxacin for a probable pneumonia.
A urine culture grew between 10,000 and 100,000 enterococcus that was sensitive to ampicillin and vancomycin but resistent to levofloxacin.
He was maintained on an insulin sliding scale to control his blood glucose levels.
He was started on a low dose of glucotrol XL and will require blood sugar monitoring during the week following discharge to avoid any hypoglycemia.
Left hand thrombophlebitis: Treated with a 2-day course of vancomycin and later iwth a 5-day course of keflex, due to finish [**2173-12-3**] after discharge to prevent any ascending infection of an ipsilaterally place pacemaker.
He was also started on an oral proton pump inhibitor to prevent adverse effects of daily aspirin on the gastrointestinal mucosa.
Warm compress, elevation, and pain management improved the condition which was considered to be post-traumatic but chronic in nature.
* 11.Prostate Cancer: He was continued on his outpatient dose of finasteride during this hospital admission.
He required lowering of his phosphorous and repletion of potassium and magnesium during this admission.
He was kept on a diabetic cardiac diet.
* 13.Prophylaxis: He had colace and senna as a bowel regimen.
He was on IV heparin for anticoagulation.
Aspiration precautions were maintained after the patient was seen by speech and swallow consultation (see #11 above).
The patient was continued on heparin sc for venothromboembolism considering that he was not ambulating and that this had a low risk to worsen the patient's chronic subdural hematoma.
Chronic anticoagulation with warfarin or heparin was considered to not be in the patient's long-term interest because of his fall risk and because of the increased risk of these medications worsening a chronic subdural hematoma.
During his admission, he was continued on he was continued on his outpatient aripiprazole as well as a multivitamin.
* 14.Disposition: Physical therapy and occupational therapy recommended acute inpatient rehabilitation and the patient was discharged in improved and stable condition to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital after whcih he may return to the [**Hospital1 100**] Rehabilitaiton Center for the Aged.
He has follow-up appointments scheduled and will, however require glucose monitoring in the week following discharge to monitor for hypoglycemia following institution of glucotorl XL as above.
