Your blood pressure was never dangerously low, but you were transfused with 5 units of blood and your blood-thinning medication (Coumadin) was stopped and its effects were reversed.
You had a tagged red cell scan at [**Hospital3 417**], which indicated active bleeding and since it was felt that surgery was not in your best interest, you were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
They recommended a repeat colonoscopy as an outpatient.
You were placed back on your home medication verapamil and also received IV medication to help slow your heart rate.
We made the following changes to your medications: We STOPPED coumadin due to your GI bleeding; further guidance regarding this medication is discussed below We STOPPED Plaquenil as it was not clear whether you had an indication for this treatment and did not think you were taking this at home We CHANGED your Lasix from 80 mg once per day to 40 mg once per day; you should weigh yourself daily and if your weight increases more than 3 lbs over 2 days, you may need to increase this dose back to 80 mg once per day We CHANGED your Lantus dose from 16 U in the morning and 19U in the evening to 10 U in the evening- in addition to sliding scale insulin; depending on your blood sugar checks, your Lantus dose may need to be increased We continued your Aspirin 81 mg each day, Ativan 0.5 mg each night as needed for sleep, Verapamil 180 mg SR each morning, Simvastatin 80 mg each day and Metoprolol 50 mg three times per day We STOPPED your Novolog .
*You should restart your coumadin on [**9-6**] at 5 mg per day.
Because being on coumadin does increase your risk for GI bleeds, any concerns regarding re-starting this medication should be discussed with your primary care doctor and your daughter.
