Admission Date:  [**2151-6-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-6-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2073-9-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**] Chief Complaint: BRBPR  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Examine under anesthesia with anoscopy Colonoscopy EGD   History of Present Illness: This is a 77-year-old Spanish-speaking Jehovah's witness with multiple medical comorbidities (HTN, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, anxiety/depression, Parkinson's and dementia) who underwent hemorrhoidal surgery on [**6-4**], developed BRBPR 2 days later and was found to have Hct of 24 and INR on 10 (not on coumadin), stabilized in MICU and now transferred to the floor for further w/u of anemia.
The patient had outpatient hemorrhoidectomy without complications on [**6-4**] under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 109605**] [**Name (STitle) **] here at [**Hospital1 18**] for chronic symptomatic hemorrhoids.
Per OP note, there were large partially prolapsing hemorrhoids with a significant external component in the right posterior and left lateral position which were removed with a electrocautery and LigaSure and a small right anterior hemorrhoid which was electrocoagulated because it was internal.
Her INR was found to be 9.9 although the patient reports to never having been on coumadin and was not taking any herbal medications or rat poison.
She was taken to the OR on [**6-11**] for [**Month/Day (4) **] with anoscopy where her hemorrhoids were noted to appear clean, although melena was found and her rectum was packed with Surgicell.

Impression: Polyp in the stomach Otherwise normal colonoscopy to third part of the duodenum   Brief Hospital Course: 77-year-old Spanish-speaking Jehovah's witness with multiple medical comorbidities (HTN, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, anxiety/depression, Parkinson's and dementia) who underwent hemorrhoidal surgery on [**6-4**], developed BRBPR 2 days later and was found to have Hct of 24 and INR on 10 (not on coumadin), stabilized in MICU then transferred to the floor for further w/u of anemia and management of rectal and abdominal pain.
[**Month/Year (2) **] with anoscopy showed "absolutely no evidence of bleeding at any of the [hemorrhoid] sites."
However, colonoscopy was remarkable for diverticulosis of the whole colon, several small (2-5 mm) polyps and ulceration in the rectum, the latter thought to be the most likely cause of the patient's bleeding, although it is unclear why [**Name (NI) **] did not mention the rectal ulcers.
Patient is a Jehovah's witness thus wishes to not receive any blood products.
She was already on oxycodone and morphine for back pain, which we continued.
We also started her on lidocaine and hydrocortisone cream, with minimal effect.
Etiology was unclear as the patient denied taking warfarin, any herbal medications or ingesting rat poison.
Factor deficiencies (2, 7, 10 low) and correction of INR with vitamin K were consistent with ingestion of vitamin-K antagonist.
We have sent for a lab test to look for warfarin in her initial blood samples, resuls pending.
Of note, she appears to have a baseline anemia with low/normal RBCs (mid-low 30s over past 10 years).
Her MCV was 94 but RDW was elevated, suggesting a combination of iron-deficiency from bleeding (though transferrin and were TIBC low, perhaps because there was not enough time to equilibrate) with macrocytic anemia.
She was found to have an innappropriately low reticulocyte count, although platelet and WBC count were normal thus not pancytopenic.
We explored several causes of normocytic hypoproliferative anemia including endocrine disorders (hypo/ hyperthyroidism, panhypopituitarism, hyperPTH all associated with mild proliferative anemia.
Heme-onc thought the most likely cause was nutrition deficiency thus she was started on folate and B12 supplementation.
We gave her 2 doses of PO iron after which she developed nausea and vomiting thus we switched this to IV iron, which the patient tolerated well.
