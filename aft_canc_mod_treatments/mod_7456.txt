He was taken for ERCP with stone extraction & sphincterotomy on [**12-11**].
24 hours after his procedure he was restarted on anticoagulation given his mechanical aortic valve and his post-procedure course was complicated by a slow GI bleed and bile duct obstruction thought to be a post-sphincterotomy site hematoma.
