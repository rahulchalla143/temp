Halfway through the scan, he became agitated and combative and had stool incontinence.
He was given Ativan 1mg IV for agitation.
He was given Solumedrol 125mg IV, Benadryl 50mg IV, and Pepcid 20mg IV to treat possible allergic reaction to the radionuclide material.
He was also started on a propofol gtt for sedation and 2L NS.
In the MICU, he was quickly weaned off of the ventilator and on to a nasal cannula at 2L/min on the morning of [**2167-8-31**].
He had 2 sets of blood cultures sent (though it's unclear if he was ever febrile) and grew gram(+) cocci in pairs/clusters from 3/4 bottles; he was started on vancomycin.
His warfarin was initially held due to the possibility of an LP but this was never done since his mental status seemed to be improving.
Past Medical History: Oncologic History: Multiple myeloma diagnosed in [**12/2164**] after presenting with several months of diffuse bony pain; found to have numerous lytic bony lesions and a monocloncal kappa protein in his UPEP (>8 grams of kappa proteinuria); diagnosed with stage IIIB kappa light chain multiple myeloma.
He initially responded well to Decadron and was then intolerant to thalidomide/Decadron; he subsequently responded well to Cytoxan/Decadron with a marked decrease in his kappa excretion and improvement inhis renal function.
In [**7-/2165**], he underwent an autologous SCT after treatment with high-dose melphalan.
He went into remission at this time which he maintained until [**7-/2167**] when he presented to the ED with dyspnea on exertion; he was found to have 20 grams of Bence [**Doctor Last Name **] proteinuria and new diabetes insipidus.
He was pulsed with Decadron and discharged on po Decadron for his MM and intranasal ddAVP for his DI.
On [**2167-8-25**], he was started on Velcade (in addition to his [**Hospital1 **] Decadron).
s/p autologous stem  cell transplantation in [**7-27**].
Started on Velcade on [**8-25**] (last dose 10/6).

He had 2 sets of blood cultures sent (though it's unclear if he was ever febrile) and grew gram(+) cocci in pairs/clusters from 3/4 bottles; he was started on vancomycin.
His warfarin was initially held due to the possibility of an LP but this was never done since his mental status seemed to be improving.
## ID: - [**1-24**] blood culture bottles from admission grew vanc-sensitive coag negative Staph; he completed a 10-day course of IV vancomycin and remained afebrile - sputum culture grew non-Pseudomonas gram negative rods (CXR normal); completed course of levofloxacin - ceftriaxone was added for 3 days ([**Date range (1) 18881**]) due to concern for meningitis with his second change in mental status (see below) and was stopped once mental status returned to baseline and it became clear there was no meningitis .
His warfarin and steroids were stopped at this time.
He required sedation with Haldol/Ativan/Dilaudid to get a head CT (which was negative for a bleed).
A neuro consult was obtained the next day who recommended stopping Haldol due to the rigidity.
Per neuro consult, an LP was attempted twice to rule out CNS infection, but the patient was too agitated; he was treated empirically with vanco/ceftriaxone until it was clear that there was no meningitis; he had a persistently non-focal neuro exam with no menigeal signs.
Further psychoactive meds (except for pain control meds) were held.
- he was continued on his outpatient dexamethasone regimen (8mg po bid) but this was stopped on [**9-6**] when he developed psychosis; there were some indications that he might not have been taking this at home, and his self-limited psychosis was thought to be secondary to the steroids .
A rT3 was slightly high and endocrine recommended repeat thyroid functino tests in [**12-26**] weeks (suspect sick euthyroid) for follow-up with no thyroid replacement at this time.
MRI chest showed no PE and PA hypertension - continued Advair - weaned off of O2 as tolerated .
- cont metoprolol and short-acting diltiazem for rate control - warfarin was stopped due to mental status changes; with his continued gait instability, it was deemed too unsafe for him to continue warfarin, especially since he was not in AFib at all during the admisison .
## Endocrine - dexamethasone as above - TSH, T4, fT4 all low; ?sick euthyroid .
## Hypertension: - continued on his metoprolol and diltiazem .
## FEN: Poor po intake x weeks per sister; NPO in MICU - 500cc NS bolus then NS at 125cc/hr; check fluid status closely - daily lytes; watch for rising sodium - dysphagia diet, thickened liquids; may need speech/swallow eval .
