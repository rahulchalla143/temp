In the ICU, he was started on ceftriaxone/vancomycin and IV metronidazole for emperic C. diff coverage.
He was transferred out of ICU [**2191-2-24**] and right-sided percutaneous nephrostomy tube placed for moderate hydronephrosis.
Diarrhea has not occured in the hospital.
# Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Unclear if these symptoms are due to chemotherapy, tube feeds, or gastric CA but recurrence of symptoms and inability to tolerate feeding trial with Fibersource suggests TF as cause, which may have been exacerbated by recent chemo.
- Use of semi elemental TF as recommended by Nutrition (Peptamen 1.5 for goal 60ml/hr) has been tolerable, so he will be discharged with these new TF.
C.Diff was initally a concern on admission and was started on Vancomycin and Metronidazole.
He was given fluid bolus initially and his blood pressure reponded appropriately.
He maintained an appropriate blood pressure not requiring further fluid boluses.
C.Diff was initially a concern and Flagyl and Metronidazole were started.
Vancomycin was discontinued and the decision was made to continue Metronidazole until ruled out for C.diff.
Urology and Oncology evaluated the pt and have determined a percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement would be appropriate to relieve the hydronephrosis.
His Cr returned to baseline after fluid bolus.
# [**Name (NI) 20973**] pt was complaining of persistent nausea with tube feeds.
He was started on reglan tid and he tolerated his tube feeds better, but had recurrent symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea as TF were increased.
This prompted change to semi-elemental TF (Peptamen 1.5) which he tolerated well.
He will be able to meet caloric requirements with these feedings and maintain hydration with TF and oral liquid intake.

Initially you were admitted to the ICU and required medication to increase your blood pressure as well as aggressive hydration.
Due to concern for infection you were started on antibiotics but these were discontinued as there was no evidence of infectious source and your symptoms improved.
You were started on a medication for nausea called metoclopromide and restarted on tufe feeds.
It is unclear if the symptoms were due to the cancer, chemotherapy or the tube feeds but your tube feeds have been changed to an easier to digest type which you have tolerated better.
You also were noted to have an obstruction in your urinary tract and had a nephrostomy tube placed to drain this.
