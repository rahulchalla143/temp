We made multiple efforts to decompress the colon with enemas and cathartics but this did not work.
He continued to require labetalol and nicardipine to control his blood pressure.
At this point consideration for colonoscopy was reopened with the GI team.
The decision was made to try to a Gastrografin enema both for diagnosis and treatment as recommended by the GI service.
By [**4-27**] he had a couple of small bowel movements after the Gastrografin enema and the NG tube was removed because of lack of output and discomfort.
Unfortunately by [**4-28**] the patient continued to do poorly and we felt that we had to do a decompressive laparotomy for his pseudoobstruction with high bladder pressures.
On the beginning of the operation he desaturated and the feeling was that he probably had an endobronchial on the right and a left chest tube was placed and the endotracheal tube was pulled back.
The cecum was very distended and cecostomy tube was placed with a 26 Foley.
The patient continued to require high-dose pressors without much response.
A family meeting was held with the patient's wife and they decided that given his current status and his underlying condition, that they would proceed with comfort measures only.
