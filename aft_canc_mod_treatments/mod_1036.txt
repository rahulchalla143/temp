[**Name (NI) **] had notable systolic blood pressured in the 70s in ED at OSH prior to transfer and he needed to be placed on both levophed and neosynephrine initially.
During his ICU course he was weaned down to Levophed alone and then slowly taken off pressor support completely with gentle fluid boluses for occasional low blood pressures which were predominantly limited to the setting of him requiring amiodarone boluses or IV metoprolol pushes when his atrial fibrillation episodes occurred throughout his ICU stay.
Otherwise, blood pressures improved overall after patient had been adequately treated with IV Vancomycin for his MRSA bacteremia and MRSA pneumonia.
Initially felt that his right hand cellulitis from recent IV placement may have been possible source.
He was given a prolonged course of IV Vancomycin starting on [**4-17**] or MRSA bacteremia and MRSA pneumonia.
He was extubated to BIPAP and required intermittent BIPAP for about 24 hrs following extubation.
He continued to struggle with hypoxemia and shortness of breath and required re-intubation after additional hypercarbia developed on [**2183-4-30**].
Treated with additional Zosyn antibiotics for concern for additional aspiration PNA which may have triggered need for his second intubation.
He was given multiple IV Lasix PRN doses and even a Lasix drip at times to help accomplish diuresis for his ongoing pulmonary edema which was also another factor felt to be contributing to his poor respiratory status.
On [**2183-5-1**] had a bronchoscopy that showed area of small collapse in LUL with question of recurrent lung cancer so interventional pulmonology team consulted and after holding Plavix dose for about a week he had lung biopsy and repeat bronchoscopy which was consistent with malignant mass and pathology revealed squamous cell lung cancer.
There were brief discussions for PEG/tracheostomy placement but patient was able to be extubated successfully [**2183-5-7**].
COPD EXACERBATION: Initially treated more aggressively with steroids and standing nebulizers.
As above, respiratory failure required two intubations and multiple use of BIPAP and facemask at high flow to maintain oxygen saturations >88%.
Notably, wife reported sun downing at home and issues with confusion for several months prior to admission.
He was treated initially with olanzapine and then switched to standing Haldol with good effect initially but he seemed to get more agitated so QHS Zydis was combined with standing and PRN haldol dosing.
Psychiatry was consulted and agreed with Haldol therapy.
Unfortunately, his delerium worsened over the last few days of his ICU course and he required soft restraints and additional doses of Haldol with frequent re-orientation by staff.
Cardiology was consulted for additional guidance during his ICU stay.
Patient's home regimen of quinidine stopped and he was loaded with IV amiodarone given his hemodynamic instability with rapid rhythm.
He was re-bolused with Amiodarone for ongoing SVT and later in hospital course metoprolol IV was added on a standing basis for additional control and worked well.
Dobhoff placed for nutritional feedings.
Started on TF regimen.
PEG considered briefly but after goals of care discussion with family after recurrent lung cancer diagnosis and worse respiratory failure and progressive altered mental status the family wished to only keep patient comfortable and did not want any more surgeries.
Treated with 7 day course of IV fluconazole for presumed [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis.
