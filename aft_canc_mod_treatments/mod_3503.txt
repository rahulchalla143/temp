In IR pt had extensive thrombectomy with recanalization of thrombosis in popliteal, femoral, iliac, and IVC with mechanical device using AngioJet and balloon angioplasty.
His IVC filter was left in place.
A stat hct was sent and revealed a drop from 29.5 immediately post procedure to 23.6.
T+S was sent and he was ordered for FFP and prbcs and transferred to the ICU for further monitoring and care.
Otherwise, no fevers, chills, SOB, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, V/D/dysuria, +notable hematuria, -joint pains, -headache, -new paresthesias.

[**Numeric Identifier 75975**] PTA VENOUS  [**2189-2-9**] 1:48 PM PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: After explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure, informed consent was obtained from the patient (after translation) and from his healthcare proxy (son).
The patient was placed prone on the angiographic and both popliteal areas were prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.
After injection of 1% lidocaine and using ultrasound guidance, access was gained into the right popliteal vein with a micropuncture needle.
A micropuncture needle was exchanged for a 4.5 French micropuncture sheath.
A 0.035 Bentson guidewire was advanced through the micropuncture sheath into the high IVC under fluoroscopic guidance.
A micropuncture sheath was exchanged for a 6 French vascular sheath.
A 5 French Kumpe catheter was advanced into the iliac vein and SVC and a venogram was obtained, which demonstrated thrombosis in the right iliac vein and IVC, below the IVC filter.
A micropuncture needle was exchanged for a 4.5 micropuncture sheath.
A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire was advanced through the micropuncture sheath into the high IVC under fluoroscopic guidance.
A micropuncture sheath was exchanged for a 6 French vascular sheath.
Mechanical thrombectomy was performed from the IVC to both popliteal veins with the AngioJet thrombectomy device.
Venogram after mechanical thrombectomy was obtained with injection of contrast through right vascular sheath, which demonstrated multiple stenoses/residual mural thrombosis of the left popliteal and left femoral vein.
Balloon dilatation was performed from both iliac veins to both popliteal veins with 6 mm x 4 cm balloons.
Venograms after balloon dilatation was obtained with injection of both popliteal veins sheaths, which demonstrated marked interval improvement of venous flow with small residual mural thrombosis.
Iliac venogram was then obtained through a 5 French Omniflush catheter which was placed in the left common iliac vein, which demonstrated marked improvement in the thrombosis and venous flow from the iliac vein into the IVC.
Popliteal vein sheaths were removed and manual compression was held for 10 minutes until hemostasis was achieved.
A compression dressing was applied at both popliteal vein puncture sites.
Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of 25 mcg of fentanyl and 0.5 mg of Versed throughout the total intraservice time of 55 minutes during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored.
COMPLICATION: Hematuria developed right after the procedure and is likely due to hemolysis from the Angiojet thrombectomy.
Good hydration should be mantained and creatinine checked.
Successful recanalization of thrombosis in popliteal, femoral, iliac, and IVC with mechanical thrombectomy using AngioJet and balloon angioplasty, with good angiographic result and some residual mural thrombosis.
The rectum and sigmoid colon contain oral contrast.

Diff ([**2-14**]) - positive Blood Cx ([**2-18**]) - negative x 2 sets   Brief Hospital Course: 78 y.o man with recently diagnosed adenocarcinoma (unclear primary, lung vs. prostate likely) s/p T4-7 laminectomy c/b hemorrhage, resulting in paraplegia, s/p IVF filter, with increased LE/scrotal edema today now s/p mechanical thrombolysis/angioplasty of DVT and repositioning of IVC filter.
No clear source of aneurysm or hematoma b/l popliteal and right groin on bedside U/S performed by IR.
BP improved after fluid and blood transfusion (got 2U PRBCs and 2U FFP).
He did receive intermittent doses of lasix (IV and PO) which also affected blood pressure.
Hematuria later recurred after he received Lepirudin (see below).
He was seen by the urology service who recommended intermittent flushes or CBI (250-500cc up to twice a day as needed).
3) Extensive Lower extremity DVTs/Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia Although IVC filter had been replaced and mechanical thrombectomy achieved some level of success, the patient had extensive residual clot burden from IVC filter to the popliteal veins.
Further interventions were discussed with interventional radiology.
They felt that repeat mechanical thrombectomy would not be beneficial.
Only definitive treatment would be thrombolytics, however these would be contraindicated given brain mets.
Given the likely failure of coumadin (INR was therapeutic when clot developed), coumadin was stopped and the patient was placed on Lovenox at the recommendation of the heme-onc service.
Lovenox was stopped and the patient was started on Lepirudin and Heparin Dependent Antibodies were sent off.
Heparin antibody subsequently came back positive (optical density of 2.3 which is grossly positive).
Given these findings, the patient should never be given heparin products.
Lasix was started to try to mobilize some fluid.
Lasix had to be intermittently stopped due to low blood pressures.
He should continue with compression stockings and Lasix as tolerated to help with the edema.
He completed his radiation therapy of the brain and spine and completed the .
He was also continued on dexamethasone.
In discussing the case with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 13014**] of Radiation oncology, the plan will be to do a slow taper of the patient's dexamethasone over the next few weeks.
6) Sacral Decub/Scrotal skin breakdown The patient had a stage II sacral decubitus ulcer as well as some scrotal skin breakdown.
He was seen by the wound care nurse who made recommendations on wound care which were implemented.
7) Urinary Tract Infection - MSSA/Pseudomonas He was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and treated with a 2-week course of Ciprofloxacin (last dose on [**2-24**]).
The patient was started on Flagyl 500mg tid for C. Diff.
He should remain on this until [**3-9**] (2 weeks after last dose of Cipro was given).
During the course of this rehabilitation and through further discussions with the patient's team of doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) 75976**], the family will decide about home hospice.

Therefore, you were switched to a diffent blood-thinning medications, Lovenox.
Unfortunately, you developed a reaction to this medicine (decrease in your platelet counts - Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia), for this reason you were changed to another medication, Fondaparinux.
You will need to remain on this medication indefinitely.
You were treated for a urinary tract infection with Ciprofloxacin for 2 weeks.
You were started on another antibiotic for this (Flagyl).
This antibiotic will need to be continued until [**3-9**] (2 weeks after your Cipro was stopped).
You completed the course of radiation therapy to the brain and spine.
You will need to set up a follow up appointment with him to follow up on your hematuria (blood in urine), management of your foley catheter, and your elevated PSA found during this hospitalization.
Alternatively, if you would like to consolidate all of your care at [**Hospital1 18**], you can schedule an appointment with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3748**], ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 8791**].
