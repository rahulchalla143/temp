He does endorse sleeping more in the last 2-3 weeks and that he's been taking more pain medication to keep his pain at his baseline level.
Now being admitted to OMED for continued management of acute renal failure.
Confirms poor pain management at baseline.
Past Medical History: Renal Cell Carcinoma (please see below) - h/o RLE DVT [**8-/2107**] - Colonic perforation - Hyponatremia - Anemia - Cervical surgery with rod-placement due to C2 met  ONCOLOGIC HISTORY Mr. [**Known lastname 73639**] presented with hematuria and flank pain in [**1-/2107**] and was found to have a 5.1 x 5.8 cm R renal mass by CT scan and underwent partial R nephrectormy in 2/[**2106**].
In [**2108-4-3**], he was found to have a soft tissue mass (2.5 x 3.2 cm replacing the C2 vertebral body) and underwent posterior cervical fusion form the occiput to C5 as well as left sided C2 laminectomy and decompression.
Last CT [**2109-1-3**] revealed decreased tumor size, but also colonic perforation which is currently encapsulated - not a surgical candidate until sorafenib & bevacizumab have cleared system given concern for poor wound healing.

Interval increase in left nephrectomy bed fluid collection, including extravasated oral contrast, which has tumor seen at least along surrounding the inferior portions of this collection.
Treated with IVF hydration.
Additionally avoided nephrotoxic medications and renally dose medications.
#) Renal cell carcinoma/Colonic Perforation: S/p R kidney resection with diffuse metastases.
Last treatment was phase II trial evaluating sorafenib and concurrent bevacizumab.
Both of these medications had been stopped with perforation.
From the day following admission had worsening abdominal pain despite dramatic increases in both fentanyl patch and dilaudid pca.
Plan was ultimately to have IR place a CT-guided drain [**1-16**] into the fluid collection.
Mr. [**Known lastname 73639**], however, could not tolerate the pain of this procedure and was subsequently taken to the OR for surgery.
Now s/p ileostomy & pigtail placement with decreased pain.
Also started on TPN while in ICU.
Pigtail in abscess putting aout 50-100 cc on discharge.
Started empirically on Cipro/Flagyl for GI pathogens.
pancultured and restarted empiric flagyl/cipro for perforation.
With lactobacillius in abscess so transitioned off cipro and have started Unasyn [**1-25**].
Flagyl for total of 7 days.
Increased fentanyl patch [**1-14**] from 125 to 150mcg/72 hours.
Started dilaudid pca for breakthrough.
eventually was weaned off dilauded and was stable on 250mg fentanyl patch q72 hours.
Would still like to pursue palliative surgery and reversed code-status for OR.
