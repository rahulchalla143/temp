A respiratory code was called, and she was stabilized on a NRB mask sating in 90s.
She required intubation due to hypoxia.
She did receive stress dose steroids and Ceftriaxone/Flagyl/Levofloxacin for empiric treatment of postobstructive PNA.

Nasogastric tube tip coiled within the esophagus.
Endotracheal tube tip approximately 8 cm from the carina.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2133-1-9**] IMPRESSION: Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes as above.
Consider advancing endotracheal tube at least 4 cm for optimal placement.
Nasogastric tube needs repositioning.
[**1-10**] IVCgram: Successful placement of OptEase IVC filter immediately below renal veins.
Tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position.
Left pleural catheter unchanged in position.

Ms. [**Known lastname 69069**] was treated with a burst of steroids for possible post-radiation edema as well as a course of antibiotics (vanc, zosyn, and flagyl) for possible post-obstructive pneumonia; antibiotics were stopped when the team decided she did not have an infectious picture.
The patient could not be weaned from the vent, and after discussing the matter with the patient and her family, the team proceeded with a PEG and trach to allow her to be on mechanical ventilation chronically.
She receives frequent lidocaine to suppress her cough, and she has done well for extended periods on her trach collar using the passy muir valve.
Hemoptysis Hct decreased after acute presentation, but eventually stabilized around 22.
The team set a Hct of 21 as a parameter for RBC transfusion; she received a total of 1 unit of PRBCs during her course.
Metastatic Mesonephric cervical adenocarcinoma Patient was followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who had been coordinating her XRT.
The patient will pursue the possibility of further chemotherapy at NY Presbyterian.
# Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia: Patient had an acute drop in her platelets from 200s to 95 about 10 days after admission.
All heparin products were held.
PF4 antibody came back positive, and the patient's platelets recovered several days after the heparin was stopped.
Pt was started on prophylactic Fondaparinux 2.5mg sc daily.
She had pigtail catheter placed by IP with improvement in pneumothorax.
Repeat imaging after catheter was clamped was difficult to interpret because of her extensive tumor burden, and a chest CT was obtained to better clarify the extent of her pneumothorax.
Chest tube was placed to water seal on [**2-2**] for transfer and follow up CXR was stable.
She was empirically treated with vanc/cipro/zosyn for 3 days.
Once culture data came back negative, antibiotics were stopped.
Moreover, the tachycardia improved with the placement of the pigtail catheter for her pneumothorax.
She was given some IV fluids and managed expectantly, and her urine output and Cr improved.
Because of her tenuous blood pressures, the team is deferring diuresis for now with the hope that she will be able to tolerate lasix at another time.
# Nutrition:  Patient receives tube feeds (replete with fiber) at 65ml/hr through her PEG tube.
She is also able to take soft foods when she is on her trach collar using the Passy Muir Valve.
