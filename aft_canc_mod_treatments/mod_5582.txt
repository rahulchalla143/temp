Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, not significantly changed.
Cannot exclude a prior anterior myocardial infarction.
Brief Hospital Course: 87M history of cardiomyopathy with both systolic/diastolic CHF (LVEF 50-55%), CKD Stage IV (baseline Cr 2.4-3) among other issues that presented to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath with no overt evidence of heart failure exacerbation in addition to hypothermia, acute on chronic renal failure with toxic-metabolic derangements, and hypotension in setting of hypovolemia.
Patient was initially warmed passively with a Beir hugger, which was then discontinued as patient stated that he was too hot.
Patient was treated emperically with zosyn and vancomycin (1000mg given [**3-10**] 1900 and 1250mg given [**2117-3-12**] am) and his antibiotics were stopped on [**3-13**] as he had no signs of infection and a negative infectious workup including negative blood and urine cultures a CXR with evidence of pneumonia.
We continued home thyroid medications.
His metabolic disturbances improved after he was initially fluid resucitated and given IV bicab and started on calcium acetate.
Renal also recommended sarna lotion for uremic itching.
# Chronic diastolic and systolic heart failure per prior notes, though an echo from [**2117-1-31**] showed an EF 50-55% with [**Hospital1 **]-atrial ennlargement, RV enlargement and severe TR.
Coumadin was held on admission as he had an INR of 3.4, and coumadin 2mg was resumed on [**3-13**] when his INR was 2.3.
**Both digoxin and metoprol held at discharge given concerns of bradycardia and hypotension with metoprolol, flucuating renal function in respect to digoxin (level 0.8 on admit) []Digoxin can be resumed per his PCP  # Hypothyroidism  continued on levothyroxine  # Myeloproliferative Disease His hydroxyurea was held in setting of ARF and was resumed on discharge.
We discussed code status, but the patient seemed to want his doctors to give [**Name5 (PTitle) **] a shot at CPR, even despite explaining how the majority of patients do not survive a cardiac arrest and with his illnesses it would be less likely and that cardiac resuscitation can be just as invasive or more than dialysis and if he survived he would need dialysis.
The patient is not ready for dialysis because his approach would be to return to the hospital if he got sick again.
