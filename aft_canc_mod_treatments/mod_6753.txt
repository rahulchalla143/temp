She apparently had been having some bloody trach secretions for some time since she had started her XRT/chemotherapy but these increased yesterday.
She was hemodynamically stable at her NH and was evaluated by the MD there who started her on vancomycin and sent her to the hospital for further evaluation.
In the ED, she was initially febrile to 102.8 but had no complaints and was satting well on RA but was put on O2 because of increased secretions.
Her labs were significant for hyponatremia and borderline neutropenia and she received cefepime (had already received vancomycin at her NH).
Blood and urine cultures were sent and she was admitted to the ICU for further management.
In the ICU, she denied any difficulty breathing, N/V, abdominal pain, chest pain, HA, difficulty with vision, diarrhea, dysuria, or weakness.
