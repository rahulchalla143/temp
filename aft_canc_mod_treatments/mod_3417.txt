Part 2 is additionally labeled "right temporal lobe tumor" and consists of an aggregate of red brown blood clot with scant fragment of tan tissue, measuring 4.1 x 3.4 x 0.9 cm.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated POD 1.
On POD 1 he failed bedside swallow evaluation so a dobhoff was placed and he was started on tubefeeds.
His steriods were also started on a taper to 2mg dexamethasone [**Hospital1 **].
On POD 2 he went into rapid atrial fibrillation so he was started on an amiodarone drip.
On POD 3 he was converted to IV amiodarone to PO amiodarone and started on a beta blocker to rate control him.
He was also started on Keppra and the dilantin was continued until he was therapeutic on his Keppra then it was discontinued.
He was also seen by radiation oncology who felt that he may be a candidate for radiation but wanted to see the post-op MRI before final recommendations.
On POD 6 it was noted that he had a left inguinal hernia so general surgery was consulted and it was decided due to life expectancy and that this is a chronic problem with no signs of obstruction that surgery was not an opition at this time.
His surgical staples are removed without difficulty.
