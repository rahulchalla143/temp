Per ENT team and outpatient pulmonary notes, she had been taking ibuprofen (800 mg TID, including this morning [**Name8 (MD) **] RN notes), so this would put her at higher risk for peptic ulcer disease and gastritis.
However, should be noted that per patient she rarely takes NSAIDs and only in last 2 weeks prior to admission she had taken 400 mg of ibuprofen per day.
She was started on a PPI and H.pylori ab was positive, so she was started on a two week course of clarithromycin and amoxicillin.
Her oxygen saturation remained adequate near her baseline oxygen requirement with home duoneb treatments.
