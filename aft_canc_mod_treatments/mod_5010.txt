PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Alcoholic cirrhosis, encephalopathy [**2114-8-9**], varices with banding, anemia secondary to end stage liver disease, left hydrothorax status post thoracentesis, radiology evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, CAD, status post MI in [**2099**], hypertension, had a catheter angioplasty in [**2099**].
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  A TIPS, umbilical hernia repair, bilateral inguinal hernia repair.
MEDICATIONS:  Medications upon admission: Lactulose 30 cc q.i.d., Mag citrate 60 cc q.i.d., Rifaximin 200 mg p.o.
b.i.d., multivitamin 1 daily, Spironolactone 100 mg daily, Lasix 40 mg p.o.

The patient was taken to the OR on [**2115-2-21**], for a DCD liver transplant with piggyback technique, portal vein to portal vein anastomosis, common duct choledochocholedochostomy, and proper hepatic artery to donor to the common hepatic artery recipient.
Intraoperatively the patient received 6 liters of crystalloid, 6 units of FFP packed cells, and 1 unit of platelets.
LFTs increased from pre-transplant within the first 2 to 3 days, and then trended down.
He received increased IV fluids for that.
With an increase in the creatinine the Prograf was held for 5 doses and resumed at 2 mg b.i.d.
After further review it was felt that the etiology of the acute renal failure was unknown, and it was less likely to be due to FK toxicity.
IV bicarbonate was administered for hyponatremia and acidosis.
He received IV albumin and fluid bolus.
He was initiated on IV Lasix and his weight decreased from a high of 90.6 to 78.1.
On hospital day 5, a bedside speech and swallow evaluation was requested for patient complaints of difficulty swallowing with coughing after thin liquids after extubation the previous day.
This demonstrated a moderate amount of oropharyngeal dysphagia.
and he had successful placement of a post pyloric feeding tube.
A nutrition consult was obtained and he was started on continuous post pyloric tube feed.
A left hydrothorax was noted.
He underwent a thoracentesis for a total of 1700 cc of fluid.
O2 saturations were in the 98% range, respiratory rate 20.
Interventional pulmonary recommended a Pleurx catheter placement, although they recognized that the patient had had a Pleurx catheter in the past that resulted in protein wasting and decreased nutritional status.
The suspicion was that this was consistent with hepato hydrothorax and that it would hopefully improve with time after a liver transplant stabilization of function.
He remained on post pyloric feeding tubes for inability to take in sufficient calories to meet caloric goals.
He did have 2 further video swallows, one on [**3-5**] that demonstrated improved oral and pharyngeal swallowing ability compared to [**2115-2-26**], but continued aspiration with thin liquids due to impaired vocal cord closure was noted.
No thin liquids were allowed.
Pills were to be crushed in applesauce with the patient swallowing twice with a chin tuck, followed by a sip of nectar thick liquid via chin tuck to clear any residual.
Recommendations also included small bites with swallowing twice with a chin tuck, alternating between 1 bite and 1 sip of nectar thick liquid, as well as the patient remaining seated upright for 30 minutes after meals.
He was eventually able to cycle his tube feeds at full strength Nepro with a goal of 80 cc for 12 hours.
Given persistent lower extremity edema, pitting edema of 2+ up to the knees despite IV Lasix to 120 mg t.i.d., Diamox was initiated at 250 mg p.o.
daily, as well as Zaroxolyn 5 mg p.o.
He did receive 1 unit of packed red blood cells on hospital day 19.
He was tolerating his tube feed and voiding independently.
