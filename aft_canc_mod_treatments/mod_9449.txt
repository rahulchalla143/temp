Name:  [**Known lastname 208**], [**Known firstname 15062**]                       Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 15063**]  Admission Date:  [**2172-7-15**]     Discharge Date:  [**2172-7-31**]  Date of Birth:   [**2088-3-24**]     Sex:  F  Service:  On [**2172-7-17**] patient's hematocrit was noted to drop from 37 to 29 and then again on [**2172-7-18**] her hematocrit decreased to 26.5 for which she received 2 units of packed red blood cells.
Her hematocrit continued to drop to 27.4 on [**7-18**], and the decision was then made on [**2172-7-19**] to stop her anticoagulation since she was having symptoms of a gastrointestinal bleed and had required four units of packed red blood cells.
She did well after the placement of the IVC filter and required no further transfusions.
She was kept on Protonix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **], iron, calcium gluconate, metoprolol, and Tylenol.
Recommendation was to check the serum H. pylori which was positive, and H. pylori treatment was started with Flagyl and clarithromycin for the H. pylori.
She was also found to have a positive urine culture from a sample sent from the Intensive Care Unit and ciprofloxacin was started for the urine culture.
She continued to be stable on the floor with her blood pressure under good control with the metoprolol, and on Protonix for gastrointestinal prophylaxis as well as antibiotics for treatment of her urinary tract infection and her H. pylori.
She was scheduled for colonoscopy and underwent a bowel prep that was uneventful.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Surgery was consulted for the cecal mass, and discussion was initiated with consultation of Cardiology by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 690**] and the Pulmonary service as well as the GI service in order to discern in this complicated patient which would be the most prudent course of action, balancing the risks of anticoagulation related hemorrhage from either the colon mass or the gastritis with the likelihood of extension of pulmonary thrombus or clotting of the IVC filter without anticoagulation.
There was also a discussion about the time of her surgery related to her right ventricular function.
Patient remained stable in the hospital with guaiac negative stools tolerating a lower residue diet until [**2172-7-30**], when it was decided to begin her a course of Lovenox treatment with 60 mg of subQ [**Hospital1 **].
Lovenox was started and hematocrit was repeated in the morning and found to be stable at 33.
She was then ready for discharge home, having completed her seven day course of treatment for H. pylori and five day course of treatment for her urinary tract infection.
Lovenox 60 mg subQ [**Hospital1 **].
Metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid.
Protonix 40 mg po bid.
Do not continue verapamil or Zantac at home.
