He was started on Unasyn 3gm q6 on [**6-16**] to cover aspiration which was transitioned to cefepime [**6-18**] as prelim sensitivities were resistant to ampicillin.
His antibiotics were broadened to vancomycin, meropenem, and eventually voriconazole.
He required several liters of fluid to help maintain his blood pressure.
He continued to have fevers despite antibiotic treatment.
His low albumin was thought to be contributing to some 3rd spacing due to a decrease in his oncotic pressures.
On the day of transfer to the ICU he was intubated for respiratory distress.
Several weaning trials were attempted, but he required more and more ventilator support throughout the hospitalization.
A tracheostomy was discussed with the family, but they did not think this was in the goals of his care.
He was briefly started on furosemide in the ICU, but his blood pressure would not tolerate it.
Mr. [**Known lastname 77811**] was scheduled to complete his course of XRT on [**6-22**].
No treatment was delivered while in the ICU.
He received tube feeds in the ICU.
He was started on a heparin gtt.
[**Known lastname 77811**] was a full code and aggressive treatment was pursued.
In the ICU he was intubated on admission.
As his prognosis worsened, his family decided to transition to comfort measures only.
