Brief Hospital Course: 51 year old male with metastatic gastric cancer s/p 6 cycles of ECX, history of small PE dx'd 6 weeks ago on Lovenox, ureteral obstruction s/p perc nephrostomy tube placement, bowel obstructions necesitating home TPN, and pleural effusion drained on [**2191-8-8**] who presents with worsening shortness of breath x3 days, found to be tachycardic with new O2 requirement.
He was already on lovenox but is not always compliant with the scheduled [**Hospital1 **] dosing.
As such the patient was started on a heparin drip for presumptive diagnosis of PE.
He was clinically improving on HD#3, with stable respiratory status on nasal cannula and was called out to the floor.
There he was started on his home lovenox once it was confirmed w/ pharmacy that lovenox was compatible w/ pt's renal fxn.
He does have complete obstruction of right ureter requiring nephrostomy tube, which was replaced on [**2191-9-15**] due to poor drainage and presumed obstruction.
No Cr done prior to the procedure, but would suspect that his Cr had been continuing to rise due to obstruction and may have even been higher prior to the procedure yesterday.
Had significant discomfort and nausea due to gastric outlet obstruction, ileus, and ureteral obstruction (causes signficant spasmodic pain).
In the ICU he was continued on his home regimen of prochlorperazine, promethazine for nausea, as well as fentanyl patch and dilaudid via GT for pain.
When called out to the floor, he was not tolerating anything in his J-tube, including medications; nausea and pain controlled with IV ativan, dilaudid and SL zyprexa.
Family engaged in continued conversations w/ palliative care and heme onc regarding options for treatment and goals of care.
Spiked fever shortly thereafter, started on broad spectrum antibiotics, but continued to clinically decline.
Pt was made CMO, with antibiotics stopped and comfort only  measures initiated.
