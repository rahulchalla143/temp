Past Medical History: Oncologic Hx: She completed two cycles of R-CVP back in [**7-/2130**] as part of her initial treatment for CLL.
She did not have a significant response to treatment though her white count did normalize after treatment.
She has remained with massive splenomegaly.
Her disease status was reassessed with a bone marrow biopsy, which confirmed her known history of CLL.
She also had a lymph node biopsy of the right supraclavicular node in order to rule out transformation of her disease, which was also consistent with CLL without any evidence of transformation.
She was ultimately started on TB medication regimen with rifampin, INH, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide.
The ethambutol and pyrazinamide were discontinued on [**2130-8-28**] and moxifloxacin was added.
She completed a six-month course of her TB medicines, which she completed back in 02/[**2131**].
The patient refused to take the medications any longer.
Our recommendation had been to proceed with a fludarabine-based regimen given her bulky disease, but until recently the patient refused any treatment and we had been monitoring her off treatment.
As a result, she agreed to receive treatment with FCR regimen, which she began on [**2131-2-14**].
She presents today for evaluation and countcheck following her second cycle.
