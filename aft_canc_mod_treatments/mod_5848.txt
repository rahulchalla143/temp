Admission Date:  [**2105-7-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2105-8-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2038-8-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ace Inhibitors  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9002**] Chief Complaint: DOE  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: N/A  History of Present Illness: 66 year old woman with metastatic (lung, liver, bone) endometrial adenocarcinoma that has been refractory to multiple chemotherapeutic agents, CM/CHF (EF 20%) s/p ICD, BiV pacer, Afluter/Atrial fibrillation, CKD, HTN, OSA with recent change in her code status how now presents with worsening DOE, malaise, tachypnea, air hunger, unable to speak in full sentences to the ED.
She only recently, 6mo ago, started using BiPAP regularly, which has been uncomfortable for her.
She was started on BiPAP, EKG showed LVH (apparently unchanged from prior).
She was started on nitro gtt, was given lasix 80mg IV x1 (UOP ~ 200cc), Vancomycin 1g, Cefepime 2g and Levofloxacin 500mg for suspected PNA (CXR w/ volume overload and "unable to r/o LLL PNA."
Of note, during [**2105-7-2**] meeting with Oncology ([**Doctor Last Name 6401**]/ [**Doctor Last Name **]) after a discussion regarding an incurable nature of her cancer and her refractoriness to treatments a recommendation was not to pursue further chemotherapy as her "numerous medical comorbidities would preclude her participation in any ongoing clinical trials" a decision was made to pursue hospice care.
Apparently her major concern re: intubation had been fear of not being sedated, once it was explained to her that she would be sedated, she agreed to intubation and resuscitation.

She has baseline O2 requirement of 3-4L and is on BiPAP at home.
She was assisted on BiPAP of 5 with PEEP 8 and FiO2 of 100%, which was decreased to 40%.
She was started on a Lasix drip overnight after arrival to the unit and was doing much better in the morning after admission ([**7-27**]).
At that point, she was transitioned to Lasix boluses for diuresis.
Although she received cefepime and levofloxacin in the ED, she was not continued on any antibiotics.
She continued to require her home dose of oxygen (3-4L) and would use BiPAP overnight with oxygen saturations in the mid 90%s.
Upon transfer the floor, she was transitioned from Lasix drip/boluses to fluid-restriction + high-dose Lasix [**Hospital1 **] + metolazone with continued effective diuresis.
The Heart Failure team was consulted and recommended switching Lasix to torsemide 80mg for more gradual diuresis.
This change seemed to correspond with an increased creatinine over the 2 days of treatment, so all diuretics were held.
The diuretics were held and she was given a fluid challenge, with no effect on the rising creatinine.
Since she still seemed fluid overloaded on exam, gentle diuresis of Lasix 120mg daily was started.
At home, she will skip the 1st day of Lasix but then continue her Lasix 120mg daily + metolazone 5mg only as needed for increasing edema or shortness of breath, with close follow-up by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Her digoxin was discontinued because of her renal dysfunction.
She was started on acetazolamide 500 mg IV TID, and her K+ was repleted as needed.
HCO3 levels remained stable throughout her time on the floor and her acetazolamide was gradually discontinued because this increased level was thought to be her new baseline, given her chronic CO2 retention.
# Anxiety / restless legs:  Patient was started on ativan PRN in the ICU.
On the floor, she was given clonazepam PRN and started on ropinirole with mild improvement.
# Anemia: Patient was transfused two units of pRBCs during this hospital stay some symptomatic improvement.
Her chronic anemia is likely a combination of iron deficiency, ACD (low TIBC, high ferritin) and BM suppression (reticulocyte index of 0.96) in setting of malignancy.
Her iron supplementation home regimen was continued.
Her amiodarone dosed was changed to once daily upon discharge.
# Metastatic endometrial carcinoma / goals of care: Patient previously undergoing palliative chemotherapy, but resistant to multiple treatments.
Since there was some question about non-compliance with Lasix because she was incontinent, we have decided to leave her Foley in with the intention of re-visiting the issue in a week.
We have reconciled her medications so that she is only taking those that will improve her symptoms and allow her to be comfortable.

We changed these medications a few times as we worked out the best plan to ensure you would not retain too much fluid and that your kidneys would function well.
Your physicians will continue to control your symptoms with your medications, but will do their best to keep you off of medications that make you feel unwell.
We have made the following changes to your medications: START Furosemide 120mg by mouth daily START Amiodarone 200mg by mouth daily START Ropinirole 0.5mg by mouth daily START Metolazone 5mg by mouth daily as needed for worsening edema or shortness of breath.
Please do not take your Lasix tomorrow.
It is very important to follow-up with your physicians closely so they can keep an eye on your symptoms to make sure you do not need to come back to the hospital.
