TECHNIQUE:  MDCT images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis after administration of oral and 130 cc of IV Omnipaque contrast.
A 2.1-cm non-enhancing soft tissue density (73 [**Doctor Last Name **]) lesion within the gallbladder neck is compatible with a non-calcified calculus or sludge ball, although a focal adenomyoma may have a similar appearance.
Adjacent pericecal fat stranding may be expected in the setting of colonoscopy with cecal biopsy, but neoplastic serosal involvement may have a similar appearance.
Active Issues: # Anemia: The patient was originally admitted for blood tranfusion following a finding of Hct 18 at PCP office and EGD negative for acute bleed.
He was transfused pRBCs on multiple occasions of his stay, with frequent hematocrit checks.
However, given the CT chest finding of possible GGOs in the LUL, he was started on levoquin for possible PNA.
His symptoms resolved prior to discharge, and he was sent out to complete a 5 day course of levoquin as an outpatient.
It would tend to occur following his transfusions, accompanied by elevated platelets.
Nursing care performed frequent dressing changes.
He did not receive antibiotic therapy for this issues, as it was draining.
Chronic Issues:  # T2DM: Held home glipizide and ordered ISS.
Consider starting triple therapy in future once biopsy results are available and Levaquin course is completed.
- Levaquin for 5 days for possible CAP - Follow up cecal mass biopsies - Trend Hct, transfuse as necessary - Follow up blood cultures   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
