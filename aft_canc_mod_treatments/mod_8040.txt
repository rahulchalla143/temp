He was started on TPN for nutrition on [**2192-5-14**].
He required intubation and displayed septic physiology with hypotension, abnormal cultures ultimately grew E. coli and Klebsiella.
He was treated initially with Vancomycin, Ceftazidime and Levofloxacin and later switched to Oxacillin and Levofloxacin when sensitivities revealed that his organisms were sensitive to these medications.
Following this, he had been slow to interact with others and displayed continued inability to take oral feedings and medications due to his sedation.
This was initially attributed to morphine and Propofol infusion received while in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.
Concern was raised for another septic episode given hypernatremia as well as rising creatinine and hypotension and mild fevers.
As discussed initially, a septic picture was considered and the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, however, a Foley catheter was placed and the patient exhibited a large post obstructive diuresis.
He was diagnosed with post-obstructive uropathy and was followed closely.
He was covered with Vancomycin, Ceftazidine, and Clindamycin.
They recommended that Clindamycin and Vancomycin be discontinued.
Surveillance cultures were checked and remained mainly negative with the exception of one set of blood cultures taken off of the patient's central line which grew Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative, felt to be a contaminant, given no other blood cultures grew this.
This was not treated with any antibiotics.
Access:  His central line was changed and replaced with a PICC line.
Although the study was poor, the patient was felt to be high probability for pulmonary embolism and he was treated with heparin.
He was ultimately changes to Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneously q.
Coumadin was not started because of fluctuating nutritional status.
Endocrine:  Although he had no prior history of diabetes mellitus, the patient was noted to be hyperglycemic while on TPN and was managed with a regular insulin sliding scale, and insulin in his TPN.
An NG tube was placed and over the course of the next several days, the patient's distention resolved slowly.
His NG tube was removed on [**6-9**], and the patient remained stable since.
Ultimately, the patient became hyponatremic and required further TPN adjustments.
The patient was not started on enteral feedings given his profound delirium and ileus problems.
Since he had not yet "woken up" and continued to be somnolent much of the time, even after about a month after surgery, the prognosis was quite guarded, so the decision for a PEG tube in this elderly confused gentleman was deferred.
This was changed to Protonix as Zantac can interfere with mental status in the elderly.
CT scan of the neck on [**2192-6-5**]:  Revealed a filling defect in the right internal jugular vein consistent with non-occlusive thrombus and a left subclavian line which was felt to be coiled upon itself.
Following discovery of this, his line was discontinued and changed to a PICC line.
Routine PICC line care with heparin and saline flushes.
Continue total parenteral nutrition.
Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneously q.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Colon cancer status post right hemicolectomy.
