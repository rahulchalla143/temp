He had persistent leukocytosis, fevers, and diarrhea during hospitalization and was empirically treated for C. Diff with a 10-day course of vancomycin & flagyl (despite 7 negative C. Diff toxin tests).
His thoracotomy wound developed erythema and blistering and he had an incision & drainage of [**2142-3-21**] (fluid culture returned without growth).
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics per ID recommendations.
He was found to have a graft infection (noted on CT) requiring IR drainage on [**2142-4-8**].
The patient had a tracheostomy & PEG tube placed on [**2142-4-1**] for multile failed attempts at extubation.
Ultimately, his sputum was showed enterobacter; the patient was started on meropenem.
At that time, according to the OSH notes, he was still on meropenem and this was initially continued.
In he ED he was found to have a PNA which was ultimately determined to be due to Enterobacter resistant to all tested antibiotics except tigecycline.
He initially required ventilatory support, but transitioned to trach mask on [**2142-4-30**].

Brief Hospital Course: 65 M with recent complicated hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent aortic surgery for a saccular aneurysm which was complicated by graft infection requiring IR drainage on [**2142-4-8**], enterobacter VAP now represents after initial hospitalization at OSH for ongoing enterobacter pneumonia & respiratory failure.
# Chronic Respiratory Failure:  The patient is now s/p tracheostomy on [**2142-4-1**] for multiple failed extubation attempts.
He will continue supplemental oxygen via trach mask on discharge; he will likely having an ongoing oxygen requirement.
Given the patient's ongoing diarrhea which has been unremitting since his initially hospitalizaton for cardiac surgery as well as his exposure to multiple antibiotics, it was felt that a C. Diff PCR should be sent.
Given the patient's lack of abdominal pain, fever, & leukocytosis suspicion for C. Diff infection remained low.
As such his metoprolol, hydralazine and isosorbide were held during hospitalization.
These medications should be restarted at rehab after evaluation by a physician.
# GERD: Continue pepcid 20 mg daily.
# Nutrition: The patient was discharged on the tube feed schedule he received at [**Hospital1 700**].
