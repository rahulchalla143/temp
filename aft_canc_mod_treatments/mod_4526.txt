He was then brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management.
Of note, the patient most recently underwent rigid bronchoscopy on [**3-24**] with tumor debulking via cryotherapy.
He had previously had tracheal stents placed in [**11-18**] and [**12-19**], and was found to have a TE fistula in [**3-21**] on barium swallow.
He received vancomycin and 1L IVF, and a CT Trachea per IP.
Timeline --[**8-/2131**] presented with hoarseness to ENT.
-- [**2131-9-24**] underwent rigid bronchoscopy with tumor excision and endobronchial biopsy; pathology revealed poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
-- [**2131-11-29**] rigid bronchoscopy with tumor debridement and 20x40 metallic Ultraflex covered stent placement.
-- [**2131-12-4**] admitted to ICU from clinic for urgent RT for progressive dyspnea and urgent flexible bronchoscopy which revealed extrinsic compression of the stent to 50% diameter and tumor spread down the distal trachea.
-- [**2131-12-6**] began RT for planned 5400cGy -- [**2131-12-7**] C1D1 Cisplatin/Etoposide similar to SWOG regimen for IIIA/B NSCLC -- [**2131-12-11**] percutaneous gastrostomy placed -- [**2131-12-18**] admitted with fever to 103 after 1750cGy, on Vanc/Cef/Mica.
-- [**2131-12-21**] repeat bronch with deployment of metallic Ultraflex covered stent [**41**] x 40mm within the existing stent.
-- [**2131-12-28**] Docetaxel 75mg/m2, progression after Cis-Etop -- [**2132-1-14**] Completed 5400cGy RT to upper airway -- [**2132-1-30**] repeat bronch with patent stent and no endobronchial lesions.
Patchy left base retrocardiac opacity is seen which may be due to atelectasis, although infection and/or aspiration is not excluded.
A gastric tube is again noted.
Presence of gas within the retrotracheal mass at the upper margin of the stent raises the possibility of localized perforation, a potential stent complication.
