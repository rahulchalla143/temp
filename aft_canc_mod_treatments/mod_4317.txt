Aspirin held on admission, Ab CT performed with Nephrology & Urology consults.
Cystoscopy attempted but unsuccessful due to hematuria.
Cardiology reportedly cleared the patient for biopsy, but the morning of the procedure (and of transfer to the hospital) he developed 3 pauses of about 25 seconds each, twice requiring CPR (no greater specifics) before generating a 40bpm escape rhythm and was taken to cath for pacing wire placement and left heart cath.
Developed several bouts of abdominal pain/pubic pain, never chest pain.
R radial approach, temp pacer placed, Left heart cath performed, no report of findings.
Drugs received during cath: Atropine 0.5mg IV x2, Fentanyl, Versed, Zofran, SubQ lidocaine.
CARDIAC HISTORY: -CABG: -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: -PACING/ICD: 3.
EXTREMITIES: R radial cath wound clean/dry.
Carotid studies Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid arteries.
The patient was planned for CABG within a week, but was found to have a bladder neoplasm concerning for metastatic disease and intravesicular clot in the setting of longstanding hematuria.
However, surgical plans were complicated by a newly found bladder vs prostate tumor and the decision was made to continue medical management.
He had continued episodes of angina initially in the setting of hematuria and initiation of therapy for presumed prostate cancer.
Statin and ASA continued.
B-blocker and ACE-I were held initially in the setting of heart block but metoprolol was resumed prior to discharge.
Pt was started on casodex for treatment of possible prostate CA.
Lymph node bx was not obtained since pt needed to stay on ASA for his heart condition, and IR did not feel biopsy was safe while on ASA.
After discussion with oncology, urology and IR, the plan was to continue casodex for now and follow up with urology and oncology outpatient.
Based on the prognosis of this disease, treatment will be Casodex.
# ESRD: Patient was continued on HD on MWF schedule through the renal service.
Patient should follow up with PCP for continuing GERD management and further studies (such as barium swallow and gastric emptying).
