As such she was kept on bed rest and Silvadene ointment was applied to prevent it from becoming superinfected.
The patient required a blood transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells because her hematocrit trended from 31 to 26.
For this reason it was felt that the patient would need a very long course of intravenous antibiotic therapy with Vancomycin.
A PIC line was placed and the patient's antibiotic therapy was broadened from Levaquin and Flagyl to Vancomycin, Levaquin and Flagyl.
As her cultures became finalized her Flagyl was discontinued as we believed it was not necessary.
At the time of discharge she was therapeutic on a regimen of Vancomycin 750 mg IV q 36 hours.
She had already been receiving a bowel regimen that included Colace and Senokot and she responded poorly to both Fleets and soapsuds enemas.
The patient did receive good relief with a mineral water enema in addition to oral mineral water and did require disimpaction as her bowel started to move.
The patient achieved a stable bowel regimen of Colace and Senokot and lactulose with prn mineral water enemas which she did not always hold effectively and Dulcolax suppositories.
She has had Silvadene ointment applied to both the eschar and her dry heel ulcer and is being kept in a multi podas splint with good results.
