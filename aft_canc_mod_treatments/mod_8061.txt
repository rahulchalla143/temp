Admission Date:  [**2136-3-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-4-6**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: diltiazem / atorvastatin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9160**] Chief Complaint: Bradycardia, S/P Arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 87 y/o female with a h/o systolic heart failure with an EF of 35-40%, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, MDS requiring monthly transfusions whose family called EMS initially due to lethargy and somnolence.
At that time she received 2 minutes of CPR and 1mg of epinephrine with ROSC, her heart rate remained in the 30's and they began to externally pace her.
At the OSH ER she was intubated due to significant pain associated with external pacing, she was then started on a versed gtt for sedation which caused her to become hypotensive so she was started on peripheral neo.
With the mildly elevated troponin she was briefly started on a nitro gtt, but after discussion with our ER physicians since she was on peripheral neo the nitro gtt was discontinued.
On arrival to our ER she was initially on a versed drip but was agitated and biting on her tube, so she was transitioned to propofol for sedation.
When they went to transition her to the external pacer in our ER her heart was in the 60's to 70's so she did not require external pacing.
Cardiology was consulted who felt that she did not require treatment for an NSTEMI since her troponin was indeterminate at the OSH, they recommended adission to the MICU and they would see the patient in consultation.

KUB [**2136-3-30**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 87 year old F with a h/o cardiomyopathy, AF on coumadin, MDS requiring monthly transfusions who was found lethargic and bradycardic at home, had PEA arrest followed by bradycardia requiring transcutaneous pacing and intubation and transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU.
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # PEA Arrest: prior to arrest she was bradycardic to the 30's, received only 2 minutes of CPR and 1mg of epinephrine with ROSC with bradycardic rate, requiring transcutaneous pacing.
Her bradycardia was likely due to beta blocker toxicity in the setting of acute renal failure and metabolic acidosis.
As her renal failure and acidemia improved, her heart rate normalized and on arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER she no longer required external pacing.
Electrophysiology consult was obtained on arrival in the ICU, who agreed that this was likely beta blocker toxicity, and recommended holding all nodal agents and observing.
She then subsequently became tachycardic, so beta blocker was slowly reinitiated for afib rate control.
She was restarted on metoprolol rather than bisoprolol, given that metoprolol is not renally cleared (documented allergy to metoprolol succ is fatigue, so proceeded cautiously).
She tolerated this medication well throughout her stay with no further bradycardic events on telemetry.
# Hospital acquired pneumonia: patient was initially intubated due to her inability to tolerate external pacing, and at that time, CXR was clear with no evidence of pneumonia.
A PICC line was placed and she was discharged to rehab with a plan to continue cefepime IV and metronidazole PO for 8 day course finishing on [**4-9**].
#) Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: EF 35-40%.
After being given many liters of fluid resuscitation for her hypotension, she did have some acute on chronc CHF decompensation, which signs of volume overload on exam and hypoxia.
Once her HR normalized, she was restarted on beta blocker and transitioned to metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] (no significant renal clearance, compared to bisoprolol) with good tolerance.
As above, patient should be restarted on metoprolol low dose (tartrate 6.25 [**Hospital1 **] to begin with).
Enalapril will need to be restarted as blood pressures tolerate.
# Atrial Fibrillation: on coumadin for anticoagulation and bisoprolol for rate control on admission, however both were held initially on admission given elevated INR and bradycardia.
The patient's heart rate improved and she was started on metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] which she tolerated well.
Coumadin was also restarted, however dose reduced to 1 mg daily given concurrent use of antibiotics at discharge.
Has not been given lasix since [**4-2**], but can likely be restarted 1-2 days after discharge as long as Na remains >133 and patient is euvolemic.
Started on ibuprofen for pain control and resolved prior to discharge.
Started on omeprazole 20mg daily, maalox PRN.
CHRONIC, INACTIVE ISSUES: # Myelodysplastic syndrome:  platelet count remained low but stable in the 90K range throughout her hospital stay, however her hematocrit trended down, finally to 29.5 on the day of discharge, requiring a PRBC transfusion.
# Dementia: Patient's home donepezil was held throughout this admission.

Gout  SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: - chronic systolic heart failure EF of 35-40% - atrial fibrillation, CHADS2 score of 3 - hypertension - hyperlipidemia - dementia - pseudogout - anxiety/depression - anemia - likely MDS, requiring monthly transfusions - history of breast cancer - osteopenia - carotid artery stenosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
We found that your kidneys were not working well, which may have caused you to have an increased level of bisoprolol in your blood, causing your heart to go very slow.
You were started on two antibiotics (metronidazole and cefepime), which you will need to take for a total of 8 days.
Stop your lasix dose for the next 1-2 days, until assessed by the rehabilitation doctors.
Change your warfarin dose from 1.25mg daily to 1mg daily 5.
Start taking maalox as needed for heartburn 8.
Start taking flagyl and cefepime for a total of 8 days (through [**2136-4-9**])  Followup Instructions: Please schedule an appointment with your PCP upon discharge from rehab.
