Admission Date:  [**2160-2-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-3-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2088-12-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4748**] Chief Complaint: Cold Left Lower Extremity  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left iliac, femoral, superficial femoral artery, profunda embolectomy, 4-compartment fasciotomy.
Admitting physical abdominal acities and distention.
When she arrived, her IV heparin was running at 850U/hr.
Findings poorly evaluated without intravenous contrast but potentially suspicious for peritoneal carcinomatosis, including ascites and probable peritoneal and serosal thickening.
If there is an outside hospital CT with intravenous contrast, then this can be scanned into the system for comparison.
There is mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells, and nasal passages.
Atypical epithelioid cells present: Rare clusters of atypical epithelioid cells are present, but degeneration precludes definitive classification.
She underwent a left iliac, femoral, superficial femoral artery, profunda embolectomy, 4-compartment fasciotomy.
She was taken to the CVICU, intubated and sedated and on pressors, and on a heparin drip.
She remained on pressor support, as her pressures could not tolerate her pain/sedation drips.
She could not be weaned off the ventilator - she would thrash about in the bed, and was unresponsive to commands.
She was switched to TPN and made NPO when she vomitted tube feeds - this may have been due to extensive carcinomatosis causing pSBO.
Pleural fluid cytology, from a right thoracentesis on [**3-1**], came back positive for malignant cells.
On the morning of [**3-5**], the patient became acutely hypotensive and was treated with blood (for postoperative blood loss and intravascular depletion), fluids and pressors.
Her heparin drip was discontinued.
A femoral artery line was placed when the radial line stopped working.
