She was put on multiple courses of antibiotics (amoxicillin, Cipro, etc) for total of [**5-25**] month.
HCV: She has received interferon and Ribavirin in the past, though has not received any treatment for at least 1-2 years.
Sister had squamous cell cancer of skin at age 41.
Note:  The overall features consistent with chronic viral hepatitis, grade 1 inflammation, stage 1 fibrosis.
#Pancytopenia, diagnosed as AML:  Throughout her hospital stay, the pt had profound pancytopenia and required intermittent transfusion support of red cells and platelets.
Parvovirus B19 and Herpes virus 6 were both negative.
Pt was briefly on Epogen 40,000 units per week, which was discontinued after the results of the bone marrow biopsy were finalized.
She received 7+3 chemotherapy in preparation for an alloSCT with her brother as the donor.
Her transplant preparation was also repeated: lab tests, infectious serologies,echo and PFT's.
She was started on Fluconazole and Acyclovir for neutropenic prophylaxis.
A bone marrow biopsy performed on [**10-14**], which showed an ablated marrow, and the patient was consented for her bone marrow transplant.
She recieved her stem cell transplantation on day 0 without any complications.
While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient was placed on methylprednisolone and mycophenolate.
Her methylprednisolone was weaned by 5mg qweek, and her mycophenolate was eventually titrated up to 100mg TID.
Vancomycin was started on [**10-14**], and her central line was left in place.
Flagyl and caspofungin were added on [**10-31**] as the patient began to spike through her regimen of vancomycin and cefepime.
IV Vancomycin was discontinued on [**12-24**].
Fluid restriction was stopped shortly afterward and her sodium remained normal.
At that time, TPN was started, and the patient was started on a morphine PCA.
Viral load was 12,600,000 in [**Month (only) **] [**2127**], then down to 2.27 million and after chemotherapy came up to 5 million.
Liver biospy was performed on [**8-27**], which showed grade 1, stage 1 Hepatology following, liver biopsied, which was consistent with chronic viral hepatitis, grade 1 inflammation, stage 1 fibrosis.
# Dental pain:  Pt was evaluated by a dentist, who recommended extraction of tooth #19 prior to SCT.
Oral surgeon was re-evaluated the site of extraction and agreed with abx and also suggested a dressing for alveolar osteoitis if the pain does not resolve with abx.
She was subsequently switched to Levofloxacin and Clindamycin; then just to Levofloxacin as there was no evidence of further dental infection.
She was continued on lorazepam PRN.
# GERD:  Pt continued on her home regimen of prevacid.
Per GI reccs, the patient was started on Lamivudine.
But patient was unable to take lamivudine due to mucositis.
She was given Sarna for palliation.
Given that she was laready on Fluconazole and topical [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was added.
In addition, she briefly developed a contact dermatitis under her breasts bilaterally secondary to the adhesive on EKG leads; hydrocortisone was prescribed to these areas only.
She was started on a calcium channel blocker to treat cylosporine-induced hypertension.
She was then started amlodipine 10mg daily and anti-anxiety medications, including zyprexa.
# Acute Renal Failure: Her creatinine began rising on [**11-20**] and steadily climbed during her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.
She was initially on lasix for diuresis which was then held soon after her creatinine continued rising.
RIJ dialysis line was discontinued on [**12-16**] secondary to fever, and CVVH was not restarted as the patient was not volume overloaded and did not have electrolyte abnormalities necessitating dialysis.
Her phosphate continued to increase to 9.0 on [**12-19**] and she was begun on aluminum hydroxide phosphate binder.
Upon transfer to the floor, her renal function improved steadily off of hemodialysis, and she consistently produced approx 2L urine daily.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
She was started on Clindamycin and Primaquine as well as steroids for empiric PCP treatment given recent failure to take PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
She was also started on Azithromycin.
She was maintained on Cefepime, Vanc and Caspofungin initially.
Because of the lack of evidence for a bacterial PNA, Cefepime was discontinued on [**12-3**].
After determining that she was PCP negative, the [**Name9 (PRE) 16031**] and Primaquine were discontinued; she was placed on Atovquone prophylaxis.
She was intially kept on steroids to reduce GVHD (not for PCP) but then tapered off.
Histoplasma, Mycoplasma and Legionella were also negative; Azithromycin was discontinued.
She was changed from Caspofungin to Posaconazole when one isolate of PITHOMYCES (diamacious fungus)grew from her pleural cultures.
Posaconazole was eventually discontinued given the lack of suspicion for fungal infection; she was switched to prophylactic fluconazole.
When BUN and Cr began increasing, lasix was stopped.
A repeat bronchoscopy was performed which showed gross purulent material on the ET tube but no blood.
Given the concern for ventilator associate pneumonia, she was re-started on Cefepime, and Cipro was added.
In addition, CVVH was intiated for aggressive diuresis to treat pulmonary edema.
Further cultures showed two colonies of pseudomonas, cefepime was switched to Zosyn and cipro was continued.
Sensitivities of the cultures showed that they only were mutually sensitive to meropenem, so her cipro and zosyn were discontinued and she was started on meropenem.
She was transitioned to an ativan/methadone weaning protocol which was not effective.
She was next transitioned to fentanyl boluses to aid in weaning her off the vent.
The patient had a trach and PEG placed on [**12-17**], after being on the vent for nearly three weeks.
After tracheostomy was placed, the patient was able to ventilate on her own and was able to verbally communicate.
She was still undergoing treatment for pseudomonas VAP, and is currently Day [**7-4**] of meropenem.
patient was started on gancyclovir on [**12-16**].
Given her changing creatinine clearance, her vancomycin levels were checked daily and vancomycin dosed accordingly.
Vancomycin was D/C'd on [**12-24**].
# Leukocytosis: The patient had leukocytosis during her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.
A dialysis line was an additional port was placed with the plan of removing the Hickman.
She was treated with Cefepime and Cipro until the gram stain only showed oralpharyngeal flora.
However, WBC dropped to 1.5 on [**12-24**] and medications were examined for potential myelosuppression.
Also vancomycin was discontinued.
woman s/p 7+3, and s/p allogenic bone marrow transplant on [**10-29**], transferred to the MICU after tonic clonic seizure and hypoxic respiratory failure.
# Respiratory Failure - Patient experienced acute desaturation following bone marrow biopsy and LP.
Underlying problem: PNA v. pulmonary hemorrorhage in setting of seizure with platelets of 17 v aspiration pneumonitis.
her ceftazidime was continued, along with the addition of colistin for pseudomonas VAP.
she was administered ativan and dilantin loaded.
She was continued on dilantin and did not experience any further seizures.
Bone marrow biopsy was not consistent with loss of graft, and she was continued on neupogen .
has been dosed according to renal function, previously considered discontinuing in setting of seizure and pancytopenia, however decided to continue gancyclovir with concurrent administration of neupogen.
# AML: The patient was initially admitted with pancytopenia, and was found to have AML.
She has undergone a long preparation for allogenic BMT including 7+3 induction chemotherapy, completion of abx for a tooth extraction, liver biopsy for history of Hepatits C/B and initiation of lamivudine prophylaxis, and bronchoscopy for findings of ground glass opacities on chest CT. She received a stem cell marrow transplantation on [**10-29**] without any immediate complications.
MTX Day +1, +3, +6, +11 for GVHD ppx with leucovorin rescue.
Cyclosporin d/c'd because of renal failure.
