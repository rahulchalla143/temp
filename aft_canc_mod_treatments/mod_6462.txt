Pt received 2L NS, 1 amp D50, Unasyn x 1 dose and underwent CT abdomen prior to transfer to the ICU.
There she also received Vanco x 1 dose and 3rd liter of IVFs.
On presentation, she underwent ERCP with plastic stent placed initially, and brushings done which were sent to cytology and returned "highly suspicious for malignancy".
Hepatobiliary surgery and oncology teams were consulted, and evaluation was made to determine if the patient was a surgical candidate.
Evaluation included large volume paracenteses with ascitic fluid sent for cytology which returned negative.
Prior to discharge, she underwent repeat ERCP with metal stent (more permanent stent) placement and repeat brushings sent to cytology.
She was started on Zosyn and vancomycin and completed 9 day course.
She initially required IVF boluses to maintain adequate blood pressure.
