Admission Date:  [**2200-6-12**]     Discharge Date:  [**2200-6-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2150-7-4**]     Sex:  M  Service:  FENARD INTENSIVE CARE UNIT  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 49-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2200-3-3**] on chemotherapy and XRT as recently as one week prior to admission who was in usual state of health until a few days prior to admission when he had decreased po intake, confusion and nausea and vomiting.
For these symptoms, he had been self medicated with prescribed morphine sulfate and one day prior to presentation at [**Hospital1 **] Hospital, he had contact[**Name (NI) **] his oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 28049**], who recommended immediate ..........
There, the patient was noted to be hypovolemic and was initially given intravenous fluids.
He subsequently desaturated to 90% to 91% and remained at this level despite increasing his oxygen supplementation with a nonrebreather mask.
For the shortness of breath, he received Lasix and his chest x-ray was done which showed infiltrates bilaterally, left worse than right.
Based on this result, medical team at [**Hospital3 11531**] started him on fractionated heparin and in addressing his atrial fibrillation they gave him intravenous metoprolol, intravenous digoxin and intravenous diltiazem followed by diltiazem drip.
He subsequently had a decrease in his systolic blood pressure to 80 which improved with intravenous fluids for his cancer.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital6 2018**] Fenard Intensive Care Unit for further management in light of possible pulmonary embolus.
Atrial fibrillation on digoxin and diltiazem 4.
Small cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2200-3-3**] with a central lung mass treated with carboplatin BP 16, XRT initially.
Proton pump inhibitor on fractionated heparin 2.
Colace 4.
Diflucan 5.
Carafate  FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for an aunt with a deep venous thrombosis treated with urokinase at [**Hospital6 15291**] in the past.
Required high levels of ventilatory support and continued poor oxygenation requiring sedation and eventually neuromuscular paralysis.
He was initially placed on fractionated heparin over concerns of a possible pulmonary embolus based on outside hospital perfusion scan results.
Bronchoscopy was done with lavage which yielded no organisms on gram stain that could definitively diagnose the pneumonia.
He was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics, but failed to improve significantly and after discussions with the family and thoracic surgery service, his family decided not to pursue video assisted thoroscopic biopsy of the lungs.
The patient had initially been on fractionated heparin although this had been stopped after a negative CT angiogram looking for pulmonary embolus.
