Moderate-to-severe left hydroureteronephrosis with extensive perinephric fat stranding and pararenal fascial thickening.
This could represent pyelonephritis in a closed urinary collecting system, or post-surgical changes from the recent procedure and displacement of the catheter.
Routine followup with bone scan is recommended.
-KUB ([**2203-2-19**]): There is some overlying artifact and motion on the study.
A percutaneous nephrostomy tube appears to be projecting over the left mid abdomen.
-KUB ([**2203-2-22**]): Unchanged left nephrostomy tube position.
Brief Hospital Course: 79yo male with dCHF, COPD, OSA on home CPAP and metastatic prostate cancer causing left-sided hydronephrosis who presents with displacement of his nephrostomy tube and pyelonephritis with sepsis.
# Pyelonephritis with sepsis: At admission, the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc/zosyn and his nephrostomy tube was replaced by IR.
A foley was placed which required a guidewire and assistance by [**Month/Day/Year **] given his prostate cancer and large prostate.
Given his sepsis and chronic steroid use at home he was given stress dose steroids which were eventually tapered back to his home dose of hydrocortisone.
This was not improved after flushing the tube with 15cc of NS.
We considered a nephrostogram to ensure proper placement of the tube, however IR felt the tube was correctly placed based on a KUB that was obtained.
They did not want to perform the nephrostogram given that he would have to lie prone and required intubation for this last time.
The nephrostomy tube continued to drain urine into the collection bag at the time of discharge.
# Tachypnea/respiratory failure: The patient was intubated upon arrival to the MICU for his nephrostomy tube change, which required him to lie prone.
He was extubated soon after the nephrostomy tube was replaced and remained on room air at the time of discharge.
He was intubated for his procedure as above.
He was restarted on his home dose of Lasix after his sepsis improved and continued on his home metoprolol.
# Metastatic prostate cancer: Currently on ketoconazole and hydrocortisone at the time of admission.
He continued to receive palliative radiation during his admission.
# Diabetes: His metformin was held and he was covered with an insulin sliding scale.
Ta discharge, he was restarted on metformin.
# Coronary artery disease: Continued home aspirin, rosuvastatin, beta blocker.
# Depression: Continued home dose of fluoxetine  # Transitional issues: -Will follow-up with his urologist regarding removal of his Foley catheter -Will follow-up with his oncologist regarding his metastatic prostate cancer and alternative treatment options given that his PSA continued to rise on the current regimen -Amlodipine was held at discharge given SBP of 110-120, BP control should be re-evaluated as an outpatient -He will continue Cipro PO after discharge for a total 14 day course  Medications on Admission: - albuterol 90mcg 2puffs QID - albuterol nebs - amlodipine 5mg daily - finasteride 5mg daily - fluoxetine 20mg daily - fluticasone 100 mcg nasal daily - Advair 500/50mcg 1 puff [**Hospital1 **] - furosemide 80mg daily - gabapentin 300mg QHS - hydrocortisone 20mg QAM, 10mgQPM - ketoconazole 400mg [**Hospital1 **] - loratadine 10mg daily - lorazepam 0.5mg 1-2 tabs QHS - metformin 500mg [**Hospital1 **] - metoprolol succinate 50mg Q24hr - montelukast 10mg daily - omeprazole 40mg daily - rosuvastatin 20mg daily - tiotropium 18mcg daily - tramadolol 50mg 1-2 tabs QID - Aspirin 81mg daily - ferrous sulfate 325mg [**Hospital1 **] - senna 8.6mg 2 tabs daily   Discharge Medications: 1. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 2-4 Puffs Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
