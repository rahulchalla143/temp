Briefly, the patient was initially diagnosed with seminoma in [**2189-7-20**], status post orchiectomy for testicular mass.
The patient was treated with Bleomycin 180 units, Etoposide and Cisplatin in [**2189-10-19**] to [**2189-12-20**].
This was complicated by pneumonia on [**11-22**] and no normalization of LDH, acid fast bacillus and Beta GG was admitted to [**Location (un) **] outside hospital on [**1-10**] to [**1-15**] with shortness of breath.
Amiodarone was stopped and Prednisone 60 mg p.o.

So, a left chest tube was placed with hemi valve.
The patient was started initially on intravenous Bactrim empirically for primary care physician given he was on Prednisone 60 as an outpatient and Prednisone was increased to 80 mg p.o.
Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted and recommended an existing chest tube placement of 20 cm of water suction.
Echocardiogram was performed and broad-spectrum antibiotics with Bactrim, Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone were started empirically.
Atrial fibrillation treated on Amiodarone discontinued [**2189-12-20**], secondary to question of pulmonary fibrosis.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Atenolol 25 mg p.o.
q. day, Lipitor 20 mg p.o.

Hypoxia - The patient presented with diffuse infiltrates concerning for pulmonary fibrosis and Bleomycin lung toxicity.
The patient had been on Amiodarone which has also contributed and the patient also had a spontaneous pneumothorax on chest x-ray which was managed with chest tube placement as per Cardiothoracic Surgery.
The patient was maintained on antibiotic treatments for his pneumonia, given his sick contacts, also atypical presentation, given his previous immunosuppression and therefore the patient was continued on Prednisone.
Subsequently, however, the patient had worsening hypoxia and on [**2-6**], after extensive discussion with the patient and his wife, the patient was subsequently intubated given his worsening respiratory status.
The patient continued to be intubated with worsening hypoxemia throughout the hospital course and on [**2-10**], an extensive discussion was made with the family and given the patient's inability to wean off of his FIO2 and with worsening hypoxia it was agreed upon that the patient should have comfort care as an ultimate goal for his hospitalization, and on [**2-10**], the patient was subsequently placed on Comfort-Measures-Only.
Subsequently the patient also had some hypotension which was covered with pressors and on [**2190-2-10**], at 10:26 PM, the patient had worsening hypoxia and after withdrawal of care, the patient was found to be unresponsive to deep sternal rub, no heartsounds were palpable.
History of atrial fibrillation - The patient was maintained on Amiodarone and Atenolol for rate control.
Seminoma - The patient was status post three cycles of Bleomycin, Etoposide and Cisplatin.
