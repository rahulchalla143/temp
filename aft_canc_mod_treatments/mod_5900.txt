She has been afebrile with O2 saturations ranging from 89% to 95% on her usual home O2 requirement of 3 liters.
She was given nitropaste, morphine and Lasix for congestive heart failure and eventually started on nitroglycerin GTT.
Although the patient is clearly defined as a DNR/DNI, the patient was treated with BIPAP on the last admission and thus started on BIPAP this admission as well.
Unfortunately, the patient's arterial blood gas did not respond well to the treatment and the BIPAP remained at 7.17/128/86.
The patient was started on Solu-Medrol for possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, Levaquin and Flagyl for likely postobstructive disease versus aspiration pneumonia and transferred to the MICU.
Status post resection of benign esophageal tumor 5.
Status post total abdominal hysterectomy  MEDICATIONS: 1.
Verapamil 240 mg [**Hospital1 **] 2.
Serevent 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **] 3.
Lasix 80 mg q a.m., 40 mg q p.m. 5.
Azmacort 4 puffs tid 6.
Megace 800 mg q day 7.
Prilosec 20 mg q day 8.
The patient was treated on Levaquin and Flagyl for the pneumonia.
The patient was also started on intravenous Solu-Medrol q8h 80 mg and albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers around the clock.
The patient was placed on 100% nonrebreather in the MICU with saturations in the low 90s.
The patient was given Lasix 100 mg intravenous in the Emergency Room as stated above and in the MICU an additional dose of 100 mg intravenous was given to fix the possible congestive heart failure.
The plan was to continue the supportive care while continuing treatment of her pneumonia, but not to restart BIPAP or resuscitate or intubate this patient if she were to decompensate.
At the time of discharge, the patient had received four days of levofloxacin and Flagyl and was recently started on prednisone to be tapered at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
