Pertinent Results: Summary of Studies: CXR [**9-11**]: likely aspiration event CTA [**8-26**], [**8-24**]: no evidence of PE, nodules c/w possible metastasis Abdominal CT [**8-24**]: intraabdominal collection of fluid with pelvic  collections decreased [**8-10**] ileogram: no communication between abdominal collection and ileal conduit [**8-8**] CT abd: loculated intraabdominal fluid collection [**2142-8-1**] DVT LE: negative [**7-24**] CT abd: Large collection of gas and debris in the deep pelvis concerning for anastomotic leak, but leakage of oral contrast material has not been demonstrated.

First time converted spontaneously and was controlled with metoprolol IV.
The second time 200J conversion was needed and amiodarone used for maintenance.
2) Respiratory:  She was intubated following each of her surgeries.
She developed metabolic alkalosis on lasix gtt (used to decrease bowel edema prior to closure) without any significant untoward effects.
3) GI: Fecal drainage per vagina noted approximately 2 weeks postop.
In abscence of signs of peritonitis, she was managed conservatively with IV antibiotics (Levofloxacin/Metronidazole), NPO, and TPN for approximately 3 weeks.
Overall she improved, but continued to have stool drainage and nausea.
A percutaneous drain was placed and symptoms improved.
A low residue diet was attempted but patient continued to have vomiting and therefore returned to OR for ostomy for stool diversion.
Pt was followed by general surgery after ileostomy for managment of her abdominal wound dressings including a vac dressing.
Abdominal fistulas with drainage of feculent material devloped on POD#6.
A modified low suction vacuum dressing was applied with occlusive dressing to aid in keeping wound area clean from fecal drainage.
TPN was discontinued given wishes for hospice care.
Peritoneal fluid collection developed near urostomy site (see above).
Loopogram and repeated creatinine levels of drained fluid were not consistent with a urostomy leak.
5) ID: Patient received levofloxacin and metronidazole for empiric coverage in setting of rectal anastomotic leak.
She had several courses of levofloxacin/flagyl but this was discontinued completely on [**2142-9-6**].
Vancomycin was started on [**9-3**] for enterococcus in fluid from abdomen and increased WBC.
Vancomycin was discontinued on [**2142-9-10**] (hospice).
6) Heme: pt received multiple transfusions throughout her stay.
Changes thought to be secondary to pain medication changes (starting methadone).
Returned to baseline mental status after discontinuing methadone.
Pain controlled on oxycodone, lexapro, ativan, and prn SL morphine at time of discharge to hospice.
