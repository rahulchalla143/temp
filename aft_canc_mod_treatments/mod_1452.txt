Atrial fibrillation has been difficult to control medically: she was started on sotalol 120 [**Hospital1 **], then switched to dronedarone 400 [**Hospital1 **], then back to 160 mg sotalol [**Hospital1 **] about 10 days prior to admission.
She noted no improvement in fatigue symptoms, also no improvement in dry cough which predated her fatigue and palpitations by ~1 year and was nonresponsive to antibiotics (azithromycin) as recently as 2 mos ago.
Patient has been compliant with Pradaxa since prescribed 10 days prior to admission.
Past Medical History: Atrial fibrillation [**1-/2200**] (diagnosed [**2-/2200**]) Idiopathic Cardiomyopathy, LVEF 45% (diagnosed [**2-/2200**]) OSTEOPENIA ESOPHAGEAL REFLUX BENIGN POSITIONAL VERTIGO  Social History: Lives alone, son [**Name (NI) **] involved in care.
NECK: Supple, JVP 5 above sternal angle, no cervical LAD CARDIAC: irregular rate, normal S1/S2, no mrg LUNGS: No chest wall deformities.
Ultrasound of liver is suggested for further evaluation.
A stent was not placed for adequate airway re-canalization.
A large mediastinal mass was visualized and sampled from both the right and left carinae, a total of 8 samples with at least 15 passes each was performed for cytology and flow cytometry.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 2643**] is a 79 year old female with recently-diagnosed atrial fibrillation admitted with pericardiac mass and found to have a large mediastinal mass concerning for malignancy with compression of the heart, lung, and esophagus.
Rate and rythm control was eventually achieved with oral diltiazem 60mg q6h and metoprolol 37.5 mg TID.
Her blood pressure tolerated this medication regimen and she remained in normal sinus rhythm with occasional asymptomatic PVCs prior to discharge.
Her anticoagulation, pradaxa, transitioned to UFH in order to obtain a surgical biopsy and subsequently transistioned to LMWH (Lovenox) in the event that she would require another procedure should the pathologic specimen obtained during biopsy (see below) be insufficient.
Since the etiology of the patient's problems were secondary to mass effect caused by the mediastinal neoplasm, tissue biopsy was necessary to inform future decisions on definitive oncologic management.
Interventional pulmonolgy performed endobronchial biopsy and exploration of the lung for tissue sampling and airway management.
When she returned to the floor from the MICU, her heart rate and rythym remained predominantly in normal sinus rhythm with stable hemodynamics on diltiazem 60mg q6h and metoprolol 37.5 TID.
The patient was anticoagulated with daily lovenox once a day 1.5mg/kg rather than resuming Pradaxa on initiating coumadin given the liklihood of further procedures in the near future.
They will follow up the biopsy results and discuss with patient at outpatient follow up including options for treatment.
Medicial oncology will contact the patient while she is at rehab to coordinate her subsequent treatment for her cancer.
