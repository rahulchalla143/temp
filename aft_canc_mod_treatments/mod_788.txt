Redness and induration continued to spread over his left scrotum so he presented to ED on [**10-18**].
In [**Name (NI) **] pt spiked a fever to 103.3 but otherwise normotensive and not tachycardic and was initally seen by urology who suspected superficial cellulitis, but due to immunocompromised status he was started on Vancomycin, Flagyl, and continued on Levofloxacin for risk of Fournier's gangrene.
