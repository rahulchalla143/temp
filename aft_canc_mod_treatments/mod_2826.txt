Admission Date:  [**2176-5-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2176-5-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2112-12-30**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine; Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**] Chief Complaint: Fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 63F h/o Mantle cell lymphoma s/p Part B hyper CVAD [**2176-4-29**] to [**2176-5-3**] presents with fever and neutropenia and only localizing infectious symptoms to the right labia.
She noted excoriation of this area secondary to frequent urination post chemotherapy and mild swelling and erythema that developed on the day of admission.
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis were significant for no air in the soft tissues and both consult services agreed with medical management and close observation.
The patient was aggressively hydrated with 2L NS with improvement in her BP and Vancomycin 1 gram, Cefepime 2grams and Clindamycin 600mg were administered intravenously in the ED.
Past Medical History: Mantle Cell Lymphoma diagnosed in [**10-29**] s/p 2 cycles of hyper-CVAD s/p cholecystectomy [**1-31**] Tonsillectomy (age 8) via XRT Recurrent ENT Infections as child TAH/BSO - [**Hospital1 112**] [**2170**] SCC Lower Lip s/p Resection [**2172**]   Social History: Patient lives with her husband and has one son.
Two out of four blood cultures (both from the P-AC) were positive for E. coli, and pt was placed on broad antibiotics.
Despite broad antibiotic coverage the infection spread to the perianal area and more superiorly.
The infectious disease service was consulted and recommended continuing clindamycin despite increasing hyperbilirubinemia to provide optimal coverage for toxin producing bacteria.
The Surgery and Gynecology Consult services continued to follow the patient, beginning while in the MICU, and medical therapy was recommended, particularly given concern for introducing infection in the setting of her neutropenia.
Pt was maintained on meropenem IV, and the erythema of her R thigh and mons continued to improve daily, as did her pain.
Pt was concerned about having an IV infusion pump at home due to the multiple animals living in her home; she was therefore switched to ceftriaxone/flagyl to finish out a 2-week total antibiotics course.
She attempted oxycodone but did not like the effects on her mental status.
She was neutropenic initially, but her counts recovered, and her G-CSF was stopped.
3.  supraventricular tachycardia - While in the MICU, pt's course was complicated by runs of SVT consistent with AVNRT, requiring adenosine to terminate the rhythm and initiation of metoprolol.
This was uptitrated, and pt was discharged on Toprol XL 25mg po daily.
This should be checked as an outpatient to ensure that she does not require potassium supplementation at home.
