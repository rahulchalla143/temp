Her history of cervical cancer includes chemotherapy and radiation therapy; her last dose of chemotherapy was in [**2173**] - her radiation therapy has left her with multiple complications including radiation colitis, a right ureteral stricture, and cystitis.
Urology has been consulted for this stricture and had a nephrostomy placed last year; as a consequence, she has developed multiple urinary tract infections, including pan-sensitive E. Coli and Klebsiella.
Her urologist has been consulting for the possibility of a right nephrectomy in order to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections and as the definitive treatment for her stricture.
She was to start chemo [**2173-2-25**] but Cr was 2.3, she had b/l percutaneous nephrostomy tubes [**2173-2-26**] w/ improvement in Cr.
Her most recent admission in [**2174-5-15**] was for severe diarrhea - at times bloody - which was attributed to radiation colitis after colonoscopy was performed.
She was started on anti-spasmodics; she also had a urinary tract infection during that admission for which she was treated with ceftriaxone.
Denies cough, chills, sweats, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.
Floor HPI: Patient is a 66 year old female with a history of stage IV cervical cancer, currently inactive not on chemo-radiation, with history of nephrostomy tube for ureteral stricture with multiple prior admissions for urosepsis/UTIs with resistant GNRs who was admitted with fever and urinary tract infection.
Also with UTI treated with Ceftriaxone during that admission (Klebsiella pan-sensitive).
Denies cough, chills, sweats, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.
Her UTI was treated with IV Ceftriaxone with defervescence.
Given repeat episode of bloody diarrhea GI indicated she will have a Flex-Sig with cautery after patient transferred to the floor.
Additional issues that were discussed included removal of nephrostomy tube.
Patient and family frustrated with Nephrostomy and feel it is causing recurrent UTIs and sepsis, she would like it removed.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] indicated to patient that the only way to DC Nephrostomy tube would be to complete a right nephrectomy.
Patient also with history of pan-hypopituitarism for which she is on chronic Prednisone.
She was not treated with Vit-D/Ca in the past and now has new pelvic fractures.

# UTI- Chronic UTIs related to nephrostomy tube.
History of resistant organisms in past but recent Klebsiella pan-sensitive treated with Ceftriaxone [**5-26**].
UCx on this admission did not grow a pathogen but given her complicated history with recurrent episodes of sepsis, indwelling nephrostomy bag and fever on arrival to the ED she was treated with Ceftriaxone.
After initiation of antibiotics she defervesced and never showed signs of sepsis.
Negative UCx and BCx returned and she hemodynamically stable 48 hours after last fever so her antibiotic regimen was changed to Ciprofloxacin 500mg PO BID to complete a 14 day course.
Her Neprhostomy tube was changed on [**2174-6-28**] and was uncomplicated.
She wants a nephrectomy for definative treatment and final removal of nephrostomy tube.
Patient will have outpatient follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Uro-surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] [**Name (STitle) **]: Outpatient nephrectomy and removal nephrostomy.
She will also follow up with ID as an outpatient regarding change in suppressive antibiotics given recent UTIs with Macrobid resistance.
Gastroenterology was consulted and completed a Flex Sigmoidoscopy with cautery on [**2174-6-27**].
She had loose stools with clots following completion of procedure but hematocrit remained stable and without tachycardia or hypotension.
Patient taking Ciprofloxacin anyway which would cover most enteric pathogens.
Only treatment which helped was low dose Dilaudid.
Despite that she was pre-medicated prior to CT and received contrast load without reaction.
S/p chemoradiation with ureteral stricture and colitis/proctitis.
Per report, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4149**] aware of patient and in agreement with treatment plan.
Has chronic pelvic pain due to this and is on hydromorphone at home for the pain.
Started treatment with Vitamin D and Calcium while inpatient.
Given known osteoporosis and pelvic fractures would recommend Bisphosphonate therapy to outpatient providers.
Hx benign pituitary adenoma s/p resection many years ago.
Was on levothyroxine and low dose predisone for years as a result of hypopituitarism that followed.
Continued Levothyroxine Sodium 125 mcg PO/NG DAILY and PredniSONE 5 mg PO/NG DAILY  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Follow up final CT Head read: Prelim no masses - Consider bisphosphonates as an outpatient - Patient discharged without obtaining C.Diff sample given no more loose stools.
