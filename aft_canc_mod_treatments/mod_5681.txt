SOB: likely from CHF The patient was initially diuresed for mild pulmonary edema: he received 20 IV Lasix on night of admission and 40mg [**8-2**], with good UOP.
On transfer back from the MICU, SOB was much improved, and he was on 2L NC intermittently for comfort.
There, diuresis was continued with stable Cr, and the pt was weaned off O2, able to maintain O2 saturation throughout PT exercise and reporting much improvement from initial symptoms.
Viagra was discontinued while in-house so nitrates could be used if necessary.
HTN/hyperlipidemia/CAD Norvasc and Lipitor were continued initially, but the anti-hypertensive regimen was changed in MICU (see below), and lipitor was stopped due to transaminitis.
On [**8-19**], given restoration of renal and hepatic function, he was restarted on lipitor, and hydralazine and nitrate were replaced with toprol XL 25qd per cardiology recs.
He may benefit from lisinopril in the future.
Aspirin was continued throughout his hospital course.
4. diabetes/pre-diabetic state -diabetic diet, RISS .
PT: pt was started on physical therapy during his hospital stay.
He completed a 7-day course of Levofloxacin and Vancomycin for empiric treatment of hospital acquired pneumonia.
He was also given lasix for diuresis given his positive fluid status.
A chest CT was performed to look for parenchymal disease that was not evident on plain films.
He was started on hydralazine and insosorbide mononitrate for afterload reduction.
Given his persistent oxygen requirement a diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis was performed to rule out a malignant or infected effusion.
Hypotension:  His hypotension was concerning for SIRS/early sepsis given his intial concurrent leukocytosis and elevated lactate.
His pressure stabilized after fluid boluses during his first 24 hours in the ICU.
After resolution of the hypotension, his blood pressure was elevated and he required metoprolol to maintain adequate blood pressure control.
He received bicarbonate infusion with correction of the acidosis during the first 24 hours of his ICU stay.
ARF:  The acute renal failure was likely secondary to contrast nephropathy and overdiuresis with lasix given his intial presentation with CHF.
He initially appeared to be volume overloaded on exam and aggressive diuresis was attempted once his creatinie returned to [**Location 213**].
Subsequently, lasix was used sparingly and his creatinine and electrolytes were followed closely.
He received one dose of mucomyst and sodium thiosulfate.
There was no evidence of aute bleeding initially, but his hematocrit decreased 48 to 39 after two liters iv fluids.
His platelets and fibrinogen also trended down.
He was given a total of 20 mg vitamin K, 5 units of 6 units FFP, and 1 unit cryoprecipitate to decrease INR prior to placing central line on the day of transfer to the ICU.
He was also given 3 Units of FFP prior to performing a thoracentesis for an elevated INR.
His ASA and statin were held in the setting of liver dysfuntion.
On ICU day 4, low dose metoprolol was started once his blood pressure was stable.
He will need a stress MIBI once stable.
DM:  He initially required an insulin drip for glycemic control and was transitioned to an insulin SS on ICU day 3.
He initially required fluid resucitation to maintain his blood pressure.
He received calcium gluconate, insulin with D50, kayexelate, and bicarb.
His magnesium and calcium were also repleted.
Prophylaxis:  He was maintained on a PPI and pneumoboots.
