The rash was believed to be initially a drug reaction to Vancomycin and Bactrim.
The patient was started on steroids with the belief that the rash was due to graft versus host disease.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia diagnosed in [**2135**], status post allo bone marrow transplant in [**2146-4-5**].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: 1   Prednisone 30 mg p.o.
He received fluids with no significant improvement.
He also had some broad spectrum antibiotics including Cefepime, Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
On the medical floor, the patient continued to have worsening hypoxia which was not improving despite numerous medical interventions.
In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was placed on non- invasive mask ventilation with the hope that this would improve his pulmonary status.
His presumptive diagnosis was diffuse overall hemorrhage based on the fact that he is a post bone marrow transplant patient and on his hemoptysis.
He did not improve after four days of non- invasive mask ventilation with at times worsening hypoxia and hypercapnia.
He was maintained on all antibiotics and no clear source of infection was identified.
The patient was started on Fentanyl drip and expired at 11:05 on [**2146-9-28**].
