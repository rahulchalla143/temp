Laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomies, pelvic peritoneal washings with emergent conversion to laparotomy for repair of trocar injury to left common iliac artery and vein.
In regards to her abnormal bleeding, given the benign endometrial biopsy and normal hematocrit, the patient opted to maintain expectant management.
Therefore, the patient opted to maintain expectant management with intermittent surveillance given her asymptomatic state.
The patient continues to remain asymptomatic.
After careful consideration, the patient would like to proceed with surgical evaluation.
Pelvic peritoneal washings will be obtained.
We also discussed the need for a staging procedure should surgical findings reveal a malignant condition.
She understands that a staging procedure will be performed by one of our gynecologic-oncologist here at [**Hospital1 18**] if indicated (greatly appreciated).
s/p LTL in [**2163**].
