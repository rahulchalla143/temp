The patient was recently diagnosed with a UTI on [**11-28**] and was given ciprofloxacin for a seven day course as well as Vicodin for worsening back pain.
In the Emergency Room, she was treated with sodium bicarb x2 amps, 10 units of insulin subQ and D50 as well as Kayexalate, and was transferred to the VICU for further care.
Multiple myeloma diagnosed in [**2172**], treated with melphalan plus prednisone until [**2173-8-14**], then treated with thalidomide until [**2176-11-13**] in which cause she was treated with decadron.
Multiple myeloma was complicated by multiple osteolytic metastases including ORIF of the right femur pathologic fracture in [**2173**], upper extremity bilateral osteolytic metastases, radiation treatment to bilateral hips in [**2173**], compression fractures of T12, T8, L1 through L4, right 7th rib fracture, left 5th posterior rib fracture, and soft tissue mass of the right chest wall, also complicated by hypercalcemia on chronic diphosphonate treatment, as well as chronic renal insufficiency.
Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
Tamoxifen 20 mg a day.
Tegretol 200 mg. 7.
Tricor 160 mg. 8.
Differential:  71% neutrophils, 6% bands, 16% lymphocytes, 7% monocytes.
Hypercalcemia:  Patient was treated with IV fluids, Lasix, and calcitonin x48 hours with excellent response and the calcium trending down.
Hyperkalemia:  Patient was treated with sodium bicarb, insulin, glucose, Kayexalate and albuterol with excellent response as the K came down to 5.7.
Acute renal failure:  Creatinine continued to rise from 7.2 to 7.5 to 7.9.
Patient received IV fluids with no response and throwing the patient into CHF.
There was a broad differential for renal failure including AIN secondary to Cipro, renal toxicity from pamidronate, ATN from prerenal, but ultimately due to the appearance of [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] proteins, which had been negative in the past, it is felt that this is consistent with multiple myeloma cast nephropathy.
Patient was started on hemodialysis and placed on a phosphate binder.
At the time of this dictation, the patient set up for Interventional Radiology placement of a tunneled hemodialysis catheter.
CHF:  Patient became fluid overloaded during rapid infusion of IV fluids in the Emergency Room in the setting of acute renal failure.
In the VICU, the patient's course was complicated by an episode of AFib with a rapid ventricular rate that was controlled with a diltiazem drip and eventually with p.o.
The patient was treated with Vancomycin and this was felt to be consistent with a line infection.
Blood cultures continued to be positive, however, and therefore the left hemodialysis catheter was removed.
Patient was treated with Vancomycin dosed by levels.
The plan was to give one further dose of Vancomycin after the removal of the catheter was performed.
The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells and hematocrit remained stable thereafter.
SubQ Heparin was held.
It was felt possibly secondary to liver dysfunction or vitamin K deficiency.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Continue her hemodialysis as directed.
MAJOR SURGICAL AND INVASIVE PROCEDURES:  Hemodialysis tunnel catheter placement.

Olanzapine 2.5 mg once a day.
Nortriptyline 50 mg at bedtime.
Metoprolol 50 mg twice a day.
Protonix 40 mg once a day.
Sevelamer 1600 mg three times a day.
Docusate 100 mg twice a day.
