Fistula between the left pleural space/tract of the prior left upper lobe chest tube extending to the left anterior chest wall and exiting the skin surface along the remaining chest tube tract.
Chest tube coursing through the left lower lobe remains unchanged in position.
However, the intraparenchymal portion of the tube remains completely opacified and may be clogged.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 y/o M w/h/o COPD and lung cancer transfered from OSH on POD 14 s/p left VATS + LUL wedge resection complicated by pneumothorax and pneumonia requiring 3 chest tubes.
MICU course: For MRSA pneumonia, he was continued on IV Vanco 1000mg Q12h and initially covered for gram negative with Zosyn which was discontinued on [**2109-12-24**].
Required intubation for this pneumonia and pneumothoraxes post-op.
The anterior chest tube within lung parenchyma was removed, and the 2nd and 3rd tube were kept in place.
Medicine Floor course: He was stable on the floor, requiring only small amounts of supplemental oxygen.
He continued vancomycin for pneumonia.
His posterior chest tube was removed without incident.
On [**12-28**], his anterior chest tube fell out.
On [**12-30**] he was taken to the Operating Room and transferred where he underwent a left rib resection and Eloessar flap for better drainage of the empyema.
he tolerated the procedure well and returned to the PACU in stable condition.
His dressing was being changed [**Hospital1 **] initially and eventually changed to daily as the wound was cleaning up nicely.
The Pulmonary service was consulted for recommendations for his COPD and Advair and Spiriva were added to his nebulizer treatments.
He had some urinary retention after his Foley catheter was removed and finally passed his second voiding trial.
At that point his Toradol and Lasix was stopped and he was given extra IV hydration.
Recommendations were to continue hydration and allow the patient's renal function to self resolve.
By hospital day 17 it was determined medically/surgically appropriate to discharge the patient to an acute care rehab center to continue his recovery.
He was able to ambulate with assistance and required only 2-3L of supplemental oxygen therapy.

You required an operative treatment to wash out the infection and since that time you have been improving on a daily basis.
You remain afebrile and your antibiotics were stopped on [**2109-12-31**].
You will require dressing changes to the left chest wounds on a daily basis as things heal up.
Unfortunately due to your lung disease and recent surgery you still require oxygen.
Due to your recent long hospitalization we are sending you to rehab to help improve your endurance and oxygenation.
