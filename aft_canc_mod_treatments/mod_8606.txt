We also stopped the warfarin to bring your level back to normal which helped stop the bleeding.
We also started a medication [**Doctor Last Name **] pantoprazole which decreases the acid in your stomach which may also help stop bleeding.
Because the warfarin was stopped you will need to take a medicine called enoxaparin for a couple days before the warfarin will be effective again.
