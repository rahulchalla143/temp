Again seen are extensive calcified pleural plaques the sequela of prior asbestos exposure, emphysema, and a prominent basilar interstitial pattern which could relate to emphysema, asbestos related chronic lung disease, a component of volume overload, or a combination thereof.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
Mitral valve prolapse with mild regurgitation.
Cirrhosis, with portal hypertension, varices, splenomegaly, and moderate ascites.
Given some more nodular componenets also seen within the lungs, followup chest CT is recommended after resolution of current acute symptoms.
On re-admission, paracentesis demonstrated e coli that was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and he was therefore switched to aztreonam and completed a 14 day course.
However, his hospital course was further complicated by transfer to MICU due to hypercarbic hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation and hypotension with diagnosis of sepsis.
Patient was on numerous different antibiotics empirically during his hospital and MICU stay and eventually remained on meropenem and gentamicin for coverage of klebsiella, and vancomycin, caspofungin, and flagyl for empiric anti-microbial coverage.
He also suffered from persisent hypotension causing his transfer to the MICU and throughout his MICU course for which he was on and off pressor support, including neosynephrine and vasopressin.
These issues included persistent anemia requiring numerous blood transfusions to maintain his hematocrit, neutropenia for which he was treated with a 3 day course of IVIG and maintained on G-CSF, and thrombocytopenia requiring numerous platelet transfusions.
His coagulopathy from his liver disease was also managed with numerous infusions of FFP to treat his elevated INRs.
He also developed severe anasarca with 32 liters positive during his MICU course, although he remained intravascularly dry with pressor requirement and renal failure.
His anasarca was minimally responsive to lasix boluses, followed by starting on lasix drip, which was not tolerated by his blood pressure.
He also had a history of atrial fibrillation, for which he was maintained on digoxin with poor heart rate control.
Different measures were tried to control his heart rate, including nodal agents such as an esmolol gtt, but were not tolerated by his blood pressure.
Given his overall poor prognostic picture based on the above, his continued fever spikes and pressor requirement despite prolonged broad spectrum antibiotics coverage, along with his prolonged intubation without option of tracheostomy, discussions were had with the patient's sister and best friend, who were the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy, including goals of care.
Per discussion with the health care proxy's, they stated that the patient's goals would be quality, not quantity of life, and his goals of care were changed to comfort measures.
The patient was extubated and pressor support discontinued and expired shortly after.
