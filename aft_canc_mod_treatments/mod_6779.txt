Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 year old female with h/o type II DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and recent diagnosis of pancreatic cancer ([**6-/2198**]) awaiting Whipple procedure, who presented to [**Hospital1 3325**] on the day of admission after a mechanical fall.
Subsequently she was noted to be hypotensive to SBP 60s, she was given 1.5 liters IVF with SBP to 80s and started on dopamine gtt.
She was started on a heparin gtt with bolus.
PANCREATIC MASS WITH OBSTRUCTIVE JAUNDICE: Presented with sxs of malaise and jaundice to [**Hospital3 **] on [**6-26**], transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work up.
Urinalysis: Blood-NEG Nitrite-NEG Protein-30 Glucose-NEG Ketone-NEG Bilirub-NEG Urobiln-NEG pH-5.0 Leuks-NEG RBC-<1 WBC-3 Bacteri-NONE Yeast-NONE Epi-2 .
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the distal half of the septum and anterior walls, distal inferior and lateral walls, and apex.
# PUMP/HYPOTENSION:  Per OSH records, she had hypotension to SBP 70 and subsequently received a 700 cc bolus of NS with bump in SBP to 100 at time of transfer.
Upon arrival, she received an additional 2L of NS by repeated 500 cc boluses and her SBP came up to 110-120.
She was started empirically on IV flagyl for C dif colitis.
This was supported by her bump in creatinine at presentation, which resolved with IVF.
Ultimately, we were able to obtain outside EKGs, which showed Q waves suggesting her MI had occurred greater than six months ago and that her decreased EF and systolic heart failure had been well compensated to this point with minimal symptomatology especially given her sedentary lifestyle.
Initially, she had been started on heparin and then coumadin for anticoagulation of the LV thrombus, but after concluding that her LV dysfunction and aneurysm had been present for several months we discontinued this anticoagulation given the generally stable nature of long-standing clots and minimal risk of embolization.
She was also restarted on ACEI and restarted on a BB when her blood pressure recovered for her hypovolemia as part of a good CHF regimen.
Large wall motion abnormality and aneurysmal dilation of LV was consistent with this.
Initially, there was some concern she was having and ACS but CKs were relatively low and stable and troponin elevations were not impressive.
We restarted her statin as her transaminases had since returned to [**Location 213**].
We continued her outpatient aspirin in the hospital.
# DIARRHEA:  Initially, given her previous course of ciprofloxacin and diarrhea with hypotension on presentation she was started on IV metronidazole for empiric therapy of C. diff.
After one negative C diff toxin assay we discontinued her IV metronidazole and she remained afebrile.
Thus, given the etiology of hypotension was still unclear and we were unsure of the organism, vancomycin was started empirically.
# HTN:  When her blood pressure permitted, we restarted her outpatient BB and started her on an ACEI for its cardioprotective effect.
# DM:  She was initially started on her outpatient insulin regimen, 70/30, 20 units twice daily.
We decided to stop her standing insulin and treat her only with sliding scale.
On discharge, assuming she would eat better at home we restarted her on a much smaller dose of 70/30 of 2 units [**Hospital1 **] with instructions to titrate up with her PCP and following her blood glucose values.
She was treated with subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis (when she wasn't on IV heparin).
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed.
Aspirin 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Simvastatin 10 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
Lisinopril 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
Novolog 100 unit/mL Solution Sig: Two (2) units Subcutaneous twice a day.
Toprol XL 100 mg Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr PO once a day.
You did not need a lot of insulin in the hospital.
