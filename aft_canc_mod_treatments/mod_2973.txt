Between the 19th and the [**2121-11-3**], the patient remained in the Medical Intensive Care Unit of [**Hospital1 346**] where her respiratory and cardiovascular status was stabilized and chemotherapy was initiated according to the protocol designed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
She had a clear mental status and her main complaints were abdominal pain status post exploratory laparotomy.
Tumor lysis and prophylaxis was ongoing with allopurinol and aggressive intravenous fluid hydration.
Based on this diagnosis, it was decided that the patient should be treated with the Codex-M protocol.
Also, a phosphoamide treatment was discontinued after original administration resulted in a significant change in mental status.
As a result, as of now, the patient's chemotherapy protocol has been compromised by poor tolerance and performance status.
Moreover, treatment with chemotherapy was expected to result in a high risk of bowel perforation because of melting of the large tumor mass that had infiltrated her colon.
and treated and supported with intravenous fluids and morphine.
A thoracentesis was performed on the [**2121-11-11**], and two liters of bloody fluid were aspirated.
The patient tolerated the actual procedure well, however, shortly afterwards, she exhibited hypotension and had to be transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for blood pressure support.
Her blood pressure normalized quickly, but unfortunately, at the same time, the pleural effusions reaccumulated within one day and had reached the original before thoracentesis size.
The patient was then transferred again to the floor and it was decided to hold off on further thoracentesis.
As a result, it was decided that methotrexate would not be administered to the patient, because pleural effusions contained adequate medication for methotrexate administration.
The cause of this change is still unclear, but potential toxicity from the chemotherapy regimen cannot be excluded.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] status post exploratory laparotomy, and at that time she was treated with Levofloxacin, Metronidazole and Cefepime because of her post surgical status and her high risk for bowel perforation because of her treatment for lymphoma that had infiltrated her colon.
Following the initiation of chemotherapy, the patient's white blood cell count dropped, she became neutropenic, and soon afterwards, she exhibited fever, as her antibiotic coverage was modified to include meropenem and Vancomycin.
Following this result, the patient was treated with AmBisome as well.
That was done on the [**2121-11-14**], and the culture of the catheter tip grew [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans as well.
However, due to the need for intravenous access, a PICC line was placed.
Subsequently, the patient exhibited fevers again, at which point the PICC line was removed and blood cultures that were drawn revealed again the presence of [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans.
Throughout this period, the patient was being treated with antibiotics including AmBisome.
However, the risk for future fungal infection must be weighed against the need for intravenous access for this patient who needs several intravenous medications and total parenteral nutrition.
Her mental status improved when her Hickman line was removed and her fevers subsided.
However, when her mental status and general performance status somewhat recovered from the fungal infection, she was treated with additional chemotherapy including Ifosfamide.
Her change in mental status was attributed to the Ifosfamide (Ifosfamide encephalopathy), and during the next few days, her mental status improved with the only specific treatment being administration of thiamine (100 mg of thiamine four times a day).
Following the patient's reaction to this medication, it was decided to stop any further chemotherapeutic treatment.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Upon arrival, the patient had Burkitt's lymphoma with abdominal presentation, including infiltration of her appendix, cecum, and terminal ileum.
She also developed pancreatitis following her exploratory laparotomy in the outside hospital.
During her first week of hospitalization at the [**Hospital1 69**] the patient was complaining of significant abdominal diffuse pain and was at severe risk for bowel perforation as her Burkitt's lymphoma was expected to respond to her chemotherapeutic regimen.
Fortunately, her pain subsided with a very temporary support with morphine and her abdominal examination normalized.
This was worrisome of recurrence of lymphoma in the abdominal cavity or bowel obstruction caused either by the lymphoma or by adhesions from her exploratory laparotomy or also there was the possibility of an intra-abdominal infection.
contrast and it was decided to avoid using a nasogastric tube because the patient was at the time neutropenic with a very low platelet count.
In brief, this is a very frail patient who has been in this hospital for one month and has exhibited a very aggressive manifestation of Burkitt's lymphoma with several complications, including large pleural effusions, hypotension following thoracentesis, Candidemia, with fever and cardiovascular instability, cardiac toxicity with a low left ventricular ejection fraction, changes in her mental status following her fungal infection and administration of Ifosfamide as well as pancreatitis and currently abdominal tenderness to palpation.
Because of the poor performance status of this patient, it has been decided that further chemotherapy should be held off.
The original chemotherapy regimen for this patient was designed to be the Codex-M regimen, however, the patient was never given methotrexate because of her persistent pleural effusions and the patient has had a poor reaction to Ifosfamide with altered mental status, and at this point, further Ifosfamide is being held off.
The patient has received an intrathecal administration of ARA-C.  CT scan of the abdomen following one cycle of her chemotherapy has demonstrated a favorable response to her chemotherapy; however, given the aggressive nature of her disease, it is expected that she is at a high risk of relapse unless she can continue further chemotherapy treatment, which at this point is not considered appropriate given her very poor performance status.
Evaluation of the patient for continuation of her chemotherapy protocol in the near future is recommended.
As of the [**2121-11-29**], the patient's medications include:  Acyclovir 400 mg intravenous three times a day; Vancomycin 1 gram intravenously q.
12 hours; meropenem 1 gram intravenously q. eight hours; Captopril 25 mg p.o.
three times a day; Thiamine 100 mg intravenously q. day; AmBisome 300 mg intravenous q.
24 hours; Protonix 40 mg p.o.
q. day; Nystatin swish and swallow; Peridex swish and swallow; supportive care with anti-fungal skin creams.
The patient has received so far several transfusions of packed red blood cells and platelets and has had bone marrow aspiration and biopsy as well as one intrathecal administration of ARA-C and a second lumbar puncture to evaluate her altered mental status which was negative for infection.
At this point, further plans for this patient may include continuation of her chemotherapy once her performance status allows that, and/or transfer to the outside hospital where she was originally seen ([**Hospital3 **]) as of the [**2121-11-29**], the disposition for this patient remains undecided.
