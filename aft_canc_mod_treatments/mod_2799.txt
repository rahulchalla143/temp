Although he tolerated the transplant well, Mr. [**Known lastname 60074**] subsequent 5[**Hospital **] hospital course was complicated by GVHD of liver and GI tract, continous slow GIB, hematuria with BK viruria, adenoviremia, altered mental status, and extreme deconditioning.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia (diet controlled) S/p tonsillectomy CLL (see below) .
He then completed four cycles of FCR therapy, which he completed back in 09/[**2119**].
He had an excellent response to therapy and was monitored off treatment for approximately two years.
He then received four cycles of PCR, but did not have much in the way of response and his treatment regimen was switched to R-CVP of which he received two cycles.
He had received chemotherapy initially through 06/[**2122**].
We had decided to observe him off treatment, and ultimately, we had decided to move forward with an allogeneic stem cell transplant; however, back at the end of the summer, his donor had backed out.
He has been followed closely by ID and has been treated on Augmentin since that time through therapy.
He then was restarted back on Campath and completed six weeks of treatment dose as previously his cycles have been interrupted.
He completed his first course of ESHAP on [**2124-2-2**], and tolerated this well.
Four cycles of FCR (Fludarabine, Cytoxan, Rituxan) completed on [**2120-8-15**], four cycles of PCR (Pentostatin, Cytoxan, Rituxan) completed on [**2122-10-1**], two cycles of R-CVP completed on [**2123-3-11**], Campath treatment subcutaneously initiated on [**2123-4-14**] and stopped on [**2123-4-30**], reinitiated on [**2123-6-23**] and stopped on [**2123-7-7**], restarted on [**2123-10-11**] and completed approximately six weeks of therapy which he completed on [**2123-12-3**].
Reinitiated therapy due to [**Doctor Last Name 6261**] transformation with [**Hospital1 **] treatment (Continuous infusion of etoposide, Adriamycin, and Vincristine on days [**11-21**], Oral prednisone on days [**11-22**], and Cytoxan on day 5) in 02/[**2123**].
D/t inadequate disease response from [**Hospital1 **] regimen was switched to ESHAP (Bolus of Etoposide on days [**11-21**], Cisplatin continuous infusion on days [**11-21**], Methylprednisolone IV on days [**11-22**], Cytarabine 2g/m2 IV over 2 hours on day 5 only).
The patient underwent a Busulfan/Cytoxan conditioning regimen which did not cause neutropenia and he tolerated it with only mild diarrhea.
His initial transplant proceeded without incident.

He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit following PEA arrest.
Due to deterioration in mental status and persistent altered state, the patient was started on empiric cidofovir therapy at 5mg/kg IV weekly with oral probenecid for renal protection, per ID recommendations, for possible BK encephalitis pending the CSF results.
An NG tube was placed in the ICU for probenecid administration.
His acyclovir was discontinued since cidofovir was reinstituted.
Patient was also started on thiamine and folate.
He received 2 doses of cidofovir on the [**8-25**] and [**9-1**].
After which Infectious Disease recommended not to continue therapy for BK viremia.
During this time, patient required extensive sedation with anti-psychotics, benzodiazepines, and pain medication.
Neurosurgery recommended no intervention at this time.
Despite two treatments with cidofovir, BK viral load increased to 200,000.
Patient has displayed this physiology with prior viral infectious.
Possibly secondary to an endocrine source, but patient is on steroids and a cortisol stimulation test would be inaccurate.
He was treated on broad spectrum antibiotics in case this was a bacterial sepsis picture.
He was given warming blankets to maintain appropriate temperatures.
He was warmed with a bair-hugger.
CLL S/P RICTHER'S TRANSFORMATION WITH ALLO SCT IN [**2-24**]:  Disease in remission.
Patient's hematocrit remained in the low 20s throughout admission, and he was transfused on a "as needed" basis.
#HTN:  Metoprolol was continued throughout admission.
89oF on the floor, he had previously been hypothermic with prior infections.
Overnight he was placed on a bair hugger and his temperature increased to the 96 range rectally.
Epinephrine was given once per ACLS protocol, and compressions were initiated on the floor.
Once the patient was identified as DNR, but intubation and pressors okay, the compressions were stopped.
He was intubated and transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
He was briefly started on norepinephrine for blood pressure support.
In the ICU, the patient was started on phenylephrine and vasopressin and titrated off the norepinephrine due to atrial fibrillation.
He was started on an amiodarone drip, and he quickly converted back to sinus rhythm.
He was intubated for inability to protect his airway and started on broad spectrum antibiotics for coverage of pneumonia.
His mental status was inconsistent and extubation was considered given his good FiO2 but concerns were his inability to protect his airway.
Neurosurgery was consulted regarding subdural hematomas and whether there was utility in draining them by Burr Hole; however, the risks of the procedure given Mr. [**Known lastname 60074**] underlying comorbidities were far too great.
Due to his deteriorating clinical course and grim prognosis, several family meetings were held and he was made comfort measures only on [**9-25**].
A morphine drip was started and patient was maintained on propofol for sedation and comfort.
