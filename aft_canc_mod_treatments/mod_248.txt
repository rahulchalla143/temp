PENDING STUDIES: - Pleural fluid cytology - TSH - Pleural fluid beta2-transferrin and protein electropheresis - [**10-22**] Blood cultures pending, no growth to date - [**10-26**] Pleural fluid culture, no growth to date  Brief Hospital Course: 68 year-old female with history of bilateral breast cancer and metastatic kidney cancer with extensive osseous and pulmonary metastases who was discharged to NH from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2158-10-19**] after an admission during which she was diagnosed with extensive bony metastasis, and was treated with T9-L1 posterior fusion for unstable T11 metastasis.
On this admission, she presented with fevers, confusion, hypoxia and  felt to have sepsis due to UTI.
She was initially treated with vancomycin and cefepime which was narrowed to cipro and then changed to bactrim.
She responded well to one dose of lasix but further doses were deferred as she was on room air most of the time and refused further labs draws.
She also responded to nebulizers at times.
She was initially on broad spectrum antibiotics and then narrowed to cipro.
There was some concern for delirium induced by cipro and her antibiotics were changed to bactrim.
Wound drainage s/p Spinal Fusion:  She recently had spinal fusion on [**2158-10-11**] and her wound drained a large amount of serous fluid during her admission.
Therefore, she underwent thoracentesis to sample the fluid.
Beta2 transferrin and PEP are pending at the time of discharge, which will help determine if the pleural fluid is CSF.
Palliative care follwed during this admission for titration of pain control meds.
# HTN: Valsartan was held given episode of hypotension that responded well to fluid boluses.
Her line was given TPA in an attempt to clog it.
This is likely related to her ongoing medical issues, as well as pain.
She responded well to olanzapine 2.5mg po at night, and also was written for Ativan as needed.
Goals of care: The patient was refusing multiple procedures and studies during this admission.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Pending studies: TSH, blood culture, pleural fluid culture, cytology, beta2 transferrin and PEP - Needs neurosurgical/ortho-spine followup for her wound in 2 weeks.
It has continued to drain serous fluid requiring multiple changes per day.
