BARIUM ESOPHAGRAM:  Exam was limited to prone and supine evaluation of the distal esophagus given limited patient mobility and blood pressure lability.
Within the upper esophagus, there is limited filling seen at the level of the aortic arch and lower trachea, corresponding with site of adjacent thoracic aortic aneurysm with dissection.
Mucosal abnormalities were difficult to assess given limitations of the study and lack of double contrast.
