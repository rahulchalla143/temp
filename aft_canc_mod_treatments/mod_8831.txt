MICROBIOLOGY: BCx [**2110-2-19**]: negative C diff toxin [**2110-2-26**]: ______________  Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo F w/ adenocarcinoma w/ presumed involvement of her bones, uterus and lung but currently of unknown primary s/p planned admission for right pleurodesis and pleurex catheter placement complicated by pneumothorax and new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
She was started on FOLFIRI on [**2110-2-23**], course c/b difficult to control nausea/vomiting and diarrhea.
Patient was initially maintained on chest tube and pleurex catheter to 20 mm Hg.
Her chest tube and pleurex catheter were removed after consecutive days w/o drainage.
Her respiratory status remained stable afterwards and she was kept on supplemental oxygen to keep her O2 saturations.
Due to hypotension after receiving IV Metoprolol and poor rate control with IV Diltiazem patient was transferred to the MICU.
In the MICU she was initially placed on a Diltiazem gtt then transitioned over to PO medications.
Initially patient required PO Diltiazem and Metoprolol in order to achieve adequate rate control.
However, as her nausea/vomiting and coughing improved, her HR improved so that metoprolol was taken off.
However, as her resting heart rate increased to 90s on diltiazem monotherapy (max daily dose), metoprolol was added back.
Discussion with patient was had regarding anticoagulation given new onset atrial fibrillation.
# Side effects from chemotherapy/Deconditioning from prolonged hospitalization: patient experienced significant nausea/vomiting with her chemotherapy which was managed with standing dexamethasone, zofran and ativan.
Patient was ordered prn compazine as well.
As patient was also deconditioned through the prolonged hospitalization, she was evaluated by physical therapy and it was recommended that she be discharged to rehab.
[**Location (un) 2274**] Heme/Onc administered chemotherapy during this hospitalization.
# HTN: patient's home lisinopril was held due to hyptension from atrial fibrillation, especially as she was normotensive on her new metoprolol and diltiazem.
Her blood pressure was well controlled on diltiazem as monotherapy.
