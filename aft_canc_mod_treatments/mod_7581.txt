Regimen initially included dilaudid and methadone.
Patient was ultimately continued on methadone and switched to dilaudid PCA.
Nausea was controlled with ondansetron, promethazine, and lorazepam.
Additional prochlorperazine was also used occasionally.
Patient was also started haldol with good effect.
Later she was transitioned to thorazine for nausea with the intent of providing relief from nausea and also for sedation as patient was very agitated and restless.
She received ativan for sedation with paradoxical agitation.
Patient and her son/health care proxy [**Name (NI) 333**] both expressed wishes that she receive palliative sedation as she was restless and intermittently agitated on multiple regimens.
Patient was started on a pentobarbital infusion and was able to rest peacefully with marked improvement in agitation.
She was treated empirically for cholangitis with ciprofloxacin and flagyl.
PTBD drain was placed on [**11-7**] with initial resolution of fevers and T. Bili began to downtrend.
Antibiotics were broadened to vancomycin and zosyn and patient underwent further aggressive fluid resuscitation.
Patient remained afebrile, although did require PTBD drain exchange on [**11-13**] for rising T. Bilirubin.
Patient underwent biliary stent placement on [**11-15**].
An internal drain was placed through stent to drain into the duodenum and external drain also placed.
Patient completed 14 day course of Vancomycin and Zosyn on [**2107-11-23**].
#) Nutrition: Patient was chronically malnourished with 30 lb recent weight loss, and has been on tube feeds and TPN concurrently prior to admission.
TF's were initially held as to not exacerbate abdominal pain and TPN was continued.
Upon reinstitution of TF's, there was concern for malfuction of J-tube due to apparent leakage.
Following development of VSE bacteremia, TPN was held as PICC line was removed.
PICC was replaced on [**11-14**] following >72 hours of negative blood cultures and TPN was resumed on [**11-15**].
TPN was discontinued on [**2107-11-22**] given patient's goals of care.
CHRONIC PROBLEMS #) Gastric adenocarcinoma s/p surgical resection: Originally diagnosed after subtotal gastrectomy with roux-en-y ansatomosis on [**8-/2107**] for presumed gastric outlet obstruction.
Patient did not receive additional treatment due to complicated post-operative involving severe pain, nausea and malnutrition.
Patient was deemed to be a poor candidate for chemotherapy, palliative or otherwise.
