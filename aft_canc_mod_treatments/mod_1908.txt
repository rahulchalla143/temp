Gastrointestinal:  The patient was initially admitted with a transaminitis with very elevated alkaline phosphatase.
It was initially thought that his transaminitis was most likely due to infiltration of his lymphoma in the patient's liver.
The patient was continued on Protonix q. day.
He was also started on Flagyl and Levaquin for empiric coverage of any possible abdominal infection.
The patient's liver function tests remained elevated until the patient received his first pentostatin dose on [**2188-9-10**].
Because the patient had not spiked a temperature and his renal and liver function tests continued to be elevated, the decision was made to discontinue his antibiotics, Levaquin and Flagyl, on [**2188-9-10**].
After the patient received his first dose of pentostatin on [**2188-9-10**], the patient's liver function tests continued to improve throughout his hospital course.
It is now thought that his transaminitis was most likely due to infiltration of lymphoma in his liver and may have been improved with therapy with pentostatin.
He had recently completed a ciprofloxacin course of Pseudomonal pneumonia.
Initially when pulmonary was consulted, they felt that bronchoscopy was not indicated since the patient's pulmonary issues were most likely secondary to the advance of his lymphoma.
However, status post patient's pentostatin dose on [**2188-9-10**], the patient's pulmonary status continued to decrease.
Overnight on [**2188-9-10**] the patient had desaturated to the 80s and had an increased oxygen requirement from 1.5 liters of oxygen to 2-3 liters.
He improved with Lasix 20 to 40 mg IV in one-time doses somewhat, however his pulmonary status still remained poor.
He was given Lasix 20 mg IV and put out 300 cc.
He received albuterol nebulizers and was suctioned nasally, with only partial improvement in his respiratory status.
The patient was diuresed further in the intensive care unit with 40 mg of Lasix one-time dose, and his respiratory status improved from saturating on a nonrebreather, to saturating 94-95% on four liters.
On the next day, [**2188-9-13**], the patient was stable and was transferred back to the bone marrow transplant service for further management.
He currently is saturating 95-96% on four liters and this has been stable for him.
The patient was started on AmBisome 5 mg per kg dose q. day, and at the time of this dictation has received two doses.
The patient will likely continue with this therapy for at least one to two weeks if not longer, since it will take some time for him to clear this fungal infection.
Per pulmonary, the patient should have a repeat CT scan which is currently scheduled for [**2188-9-23**] at 2 PM to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment on his disease and the size of the nodules on CT.
He was also placed on a heparin drip at 600 units per hour, which was increased to 800 units per hour several days later.
His fibrinogen began to improve on this heparin drip and the patient was also given [**1-31**] bags of cryoprecipitate prior to his pentostatin infusion.
The reason for the heparin drip was because his primary oncologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], stated that he had improved on this in prior hospitalizations.
The patient received fibrinogen and coagulation laboratory studies twice a day and was closely monitored through his hospital course.
After his pentostatin dose, the patient's fibrinogen levels continued to improve.
He has not required any cryoprecipitate and he has not been on his heparin drip since [**2188-9-12**].
They suggested performing liver and colon biopsies to truly rule out whether this is a recurrence of the CMV and also suggested starting valganciclovir for CMV prophylaxis.
In light of the patient's negative CMV viral load on [**2188-9-12**] and the patient's increased liver function tests, the decision was made by the primary team to hold off on CMV prophylaxis.
In addition, the patient should be continued on Levaquin for a 14-day course for proper antibiotic coverage for his pulmonary infection.
The patient should also be continued on AmBisome 5 mg per kg per day for treatment of his Aspergillus infection.
History of coronary artery disease:  The patient had new Q waves on EKG suggestive of a new infarct, and was cycles for cardiac enzymes x 3.
When the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, the thought was that maybe the patient had suffered a mild cardiac event as well, and he was watched closely on telemetry and was put on a low-dose beta blocker as well as diuresed with Lasix to help with his diastolic dysfunction.
The patient improved with the Lasix but the metoprolol was subsequently discontinued secondary to his poor pulmonary status.
Depression:  The patient was continued on his Celexa.
Poor appetite:  The patient remained with a poor appetite throughout his hospital course.
He was started on Megace 800 mg p.o.
The patient had also complained of  dysphagia in the first week of his hospital stay and with an oropharyngeal examination that was not very highly suggestive of thrush, but with patient's complaints of dysphagia, the patient was started on IV Diflucan.
However the Diflucan was discontinued when the AmBisome was started since this would be better fungal coverage.
Celexa 20 mg p.o.
Amiodarone 200 mg p.o.
Allopurinol 150 mg p.o.
Prednisone 10 mg p.o.
Ritalin 5 mg p.o.
Spironolactone 25 mg p.o.
Bactrim 1 double-strength tablet q. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Fentanyl patch 25 mcg per hour transdermal q.
Dilaudid 1-2 mg p.o.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Lipitor 40 mg p.o.
Nystatin swish and swallow.
