Therefore, the mild-to-moderate generalized pulmonary edema could be due to transfusion reaction rather than the hemodynamic effect of blood product administration.
Dual-channel right supraclavicular line ends in the upper right atrium.
Following embolization of a superior rectal artery, there was no contrast extravasation.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 y/o woman with Afib not on coumadin due to various bleeding disorders, dCHF, HTN, hyperlipidemia, COPD, and myeloproliferative disorder transferred from OSH for management of several months of recurrent GI bleeding s/p hemorrhoidectomy, massive transfusion protocol, and IR coiling of superior rectal artery.
On the medical floor, the patient began to experience massive GIB with BRBPR and clots.
She underwent iodine desensitization and tagged RBC scan that showed bleeding localized to the sigmoid colon.
#Hemorrhoids s/p hemorrhoidectomy: The patient was admitted with a healing wounds s/p hemorrhoidectomy surrounded by diffuse erythema from stool incontinence.
She was also followed by colorectal surgery who did not feel any additional intervention was necessary.
Pt is at high infection risk given that she does have an open wound with stool incontinence and she will need close monitoring by wound care with frequent repositioning in bed.
We kept her foley in place given her open rectal wound.
# acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Last Echo in [**2136**] showed EF>55%, moderate RV dilation signs of RV overload, and moderate pericardial effusion.
Lasix was initially held on admission due to concern for potential hypotension from GI bleed.
Following angio coil and cessation of bleeding, the patient was started on standing lasix dose.
She remained euvolemic and was discharged to rehab on lasix with metolazone PRN.
Home lasix and metolazone were held on admission.
#Afib not on coumadin: Patient has CHADS score of 5 but not candidate for coumadin in context of history of bleeding disorder and current GI bleeding.
The patient's lopressor was held on admission out of concern for hemodynamic instability.
However, once she stablized, she was restarted on lopressor with dose increased to 37.5mg daily for improved rate control.
The patient was empirically covered with Flagyl while at OSH.
Empiric flagyl therapy was stopped following return of negative C. diff assay.
7 day course of Levaquin was completed while in the MICU.
#Myeloproliferative disorder: Chronic leukocytosis for approximately 11 years.
The patient remained on home hydroxyurea and folic acid with baseline WBC around 18. .
#Pulmonary Hypertension: Right heart cath in [**2136**] consistent with both cardiogenic and pulmonary contributions with elevated wedge pressure and even greater elevated PA diastolic pressure per report.
Allopurinol and cholchicine held on admission.
She will need multiple dressing changes daily to keep the area clean and dry.
# Pt lasix dose was increased while hospitalized.
She will need monitoring of her Cr and may require adjustment of her lasix dose .
# Pt sent with PICC line, please remove if persistently stable and no further need for IV access (assess in 3 days time).
