She received four cycles of Adriamycin, and Cytoxan and radiation therapy and had relapse with metastases in [**11/2112**] to bone, liver, and lung.
She is now status post her second Arimidex with progression of disease and status post Taxotere, Adriamycin, and Navelbine.
She is currently on Xeloda, Zometa, and Herceptin and relatively stable since [**14**]/[**2113**].

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  49-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to lungs, liver, and bone apparently on Xeloda and Herceptin being admitted for superior vena cava syndrome secondary to thrombus.
The patient was immediately placed on a Heparin drip, and consideration for thrombectomy versus other Interventional Radiology procedures was considered.
Given the patient's significant symptoms of dyspnea as well as facial swelling, she was started on a TPA infusion for a total of 24 hours.
During the infusion the patient's Heparin drip was decreased, and she was closely monitored for neurologic, bleeding, or other signs of bleeding.
Given the small filling defect and likely fibrin sheath on the Port-A-Cath, further intervention was considered with Interventional Radiology as well as Surgery.
The consideration included balloon angioplasty and/or catheter stripping through Interventional Radiology versus a surgical advancement of the catheter tip for improved placement.
There was thought that the current catheter placement was likely causing some vessel wall injury which led to the clot formation.
A final decision was made to have the patient fully anticoagulated on Coumadin for a goal INR of between 2 and 3.
A total of six months of anticoagulation was recommended by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the interventional radiologists.
In addition, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended to avoid sclerosing agents to be used in the Port-A-Cath, which may cause additional vessel wall injury and possible clot formation.
The patient remained in hospital until her INR became therapeutic on Coumadin while on her Heparin drip until her INR was between 2 and 3.
She received two days of 10 mg of Coumadin and was transitioned to 5 mg q. day as an outpatient.
She will have an INR checked in one day upon discharge and will be adjusted by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and then again in two days, in which Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2244**] will adjust her Coumadin dosing.
Oncology:  The patient received two Herceptin treatments while in hospital, continuing with her weekly Herceptin, without any complications.
She was also continued on her daily Xeloda treatment and her Femara.
The patient's pain was fairly well controlled with her Fentanyl patch and p.r.n.
The patient received Xeloda 1000 mg p.o.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good status post TPA infusion and therapeutic INR of 2.2 upon discharge.

Effexor 75 mg q. day.
Protonix 40 mg q. day.
