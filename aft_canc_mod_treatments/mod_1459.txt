Admission Date:  [**2197-5-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2197-6-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2119-11-29**]     Sex:  F  Service:  MICU B  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old female with recently diagnosed renal cell carcinoma status post left nephrectomy and left adrenalectomy in [**4-1**] with known metastases to the lungs and liver, who presents to the Emergency Department on [**5-29**] with hypotension, history of poor po intake, as well as worsening dyspnea.
The patient was admitted to CC7 with the following course: Was treated with intravenous fluids and loop diuretics for hypercalcemia.
The patient later developed atrial fibrillation and was adequately rate controlled with diltiazem and spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm.
The following day, [**6-1**], the patient was started on base beta blocker and subsequently received 25 mg of IV Lopressor during spontaneous episodes of supraventricular tachycardia.
Patient responded well to IV fluids and loop diuretics, and treated for hypercalcemia that reverted to normal.
She was minimally responsive and intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
She was transferred to the MICU, and treated with aggressive IVF and neo and then switched to Levophed for pressure control.
Right IJ was placed for adequate fluid resuscitation and central venous pressure monitoring.
The patient was weaned successfully off pressors with aggressive IVF administration.
Urine output was continuously monitored, and subsequently the diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis was made, which was treated with pressors and volume resuscitation.
On [**6-9**], the patient was continuing to show signs of dyspnea, and failed multiple attempts to be weaned off the ventilator with hypotension persisting despite resuscitation with intervascular fluids with the addition of pressors.
Empiric antibiotics were started to rule out sepsis, and the patient was pancultured, although cultures were no growth to date.
A CT scan on [**6-9**] was obtained of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to assess for 1) increase in local recurrence of renal cell carcinoma, 2) the presence or absence of ascites in her belly, 3) the presence of mediastinal metastases as a possible etiology of her hypercarbic respiratory failure and chylothorax/exudate pleural effusions.
Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], is acutely aware of guarded situation in the MICU, and it is optimistic that if the patient is able to be discharged from the MICU, she would be able to start interleukin therapy for treatment of her renal cell carcinoma.
