[**2153-3-21**] Kidney biopsy: ULTRASOUND GUIDANCE FOR RENAL BIOPSY BY NEPHROLOGIST: Ultrasound examination of the kidneys was performed.
[**2153-3-26**] Paracentesis: IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound-guided diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis of 3 liters of serous fluid.
Renal was consulted and advised dialysis as well as a kidney biopsy.
He received several sessions of bedside hemodialysis; two sessions were prematurely stopped as his blood pressure did not tolerate it.
Cr came down to 4.2 following dialysis and further trended down to 2.9 prior to discharge.
His lasix was held given his acute renal failure and hypotension.
His other antihypertensives, amlodipine and aldactone, were also held.
Initially, it was felt that his acute renal failure was secondary to sorafenib induced nephrotoxicity.
His [**Doctor First Name **] was also positive at 1:640, lupus anticoagulant was negative, and anti-cardiolipin IgG/M were pending at discharge.
He was discharged on sevelamer for hyerphosphatemia.
He was also restarted on his lasix as Cr stabilized.
# GU bleed s/p kidney biopsy: Pt underwent kidney biopsy on [**2153-3-21**] that was complicated by gross hematuria.
He required a total of 5 units PRBCs and 1 bag platelets throughout hospital admission.
He was given IV fluids and his antihypertensives and diuretics were held (with the exception of nadolol).
Patient started on CTX 2gm Q24hrs x2 days for possible SBP, but was dicscontinued [**3-23**] as likelihood of SBP felt to be very small with no abdominal pain, normal WBC and no fevers.
Following transfusion of PRBCs and IV fluids, BP stabilized in systolic 100s-120s throughout remainder of admission.
# Hepatocellular carcinoma: Pt was s/p sorafenib [**2153-1-22**] to [**2153-3-6**].
He was continued on nadolol at admission but this was briefly held in the ICU when GI bleed was being ruled out for drop in Hct.
He underwent a therapeutic paracentesis on [**2153-3-26**]; peritoneal fluid was benign and 3L were removed from abdomen.
He will discuss with his outpatient oncologist whether sorafenib can be restarted once kidney function stabilizes.
