AML:  Patient was reinduced with idarubicin and cytarabine 7 + 3 with appropriate reduction in her white blood cell count.
She was treated with supportive care with blood and platelets, and remained on neutropenic precautions given the appropriate mouth care, repletion of electrolytes, bowel regimen, pain control, etc.
At this point in time, the decision to proceed with allo-BMT was pending.
Please see additional dictation summary for further treatment of the patient's AML.
She was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for a known right lower quadrant inflammatory process, and was treated with Flagyl, voriconazole, meropenem, Vancomycin, acyclovir, and most recently ciprofloxacin.
Patient continued to spike fevers through antibiotic treatments.
