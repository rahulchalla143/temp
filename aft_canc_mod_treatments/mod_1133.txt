Total colectomy: A.  Diverticular disease with multifocal diverticulitis and peri diverticulitis, rupture, and recent hemorrhage.
Atrial cycle length fast for flutter at 160 to 180 milliseconds.
Left PIC line ends in the upper right atrium close to the superior cavoatrial junction.
Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC.
NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
[**8-14**] CTA with IV contrast: Left subclavian central venous catheter in place with tip in mid-SVC.
There is moderate multivessel coronary arterial calcifications as well as mitral annular and aortic valve calcifications.
A transition at this level, raising concern for partial bowel obstruction versus ileus with compression of the small bowel loops.
Nasogastric tube ending ends in the mid stomach and a left PIC line ends in the upper SVC.

His hospital course was c/b difficult to control atrial fibrillation  #GI bleeding/acute blood loss anemia/total colectomy/severe diverticulosis- Patient presented with GI bleeding which on angiography was found to be associated with right and middle colic arteries (tagged RBC and CTA were negative).
He underwent IR guided angiographic embolization of branches of the R and middle colic arteries at the hepatic flexure but continued to bleed post procedure necesitating total abdominal colectomy with ilio-sigmoid anastomosis.
Due to ileus and prolonged NPO status, TPN was initiated and all meds were converted to IV, eventually he was able to tolerate po and TPN was discontinued.
He was treated with immodium with reduction in stool volume.
He continued to have tachycardia on almost maximal doses of metoprolol and diltiazem with further tachycardia with exercise.
Therefore, per Cardiology recommendations, patient was started oral amiodarone with return to sinus rhythm and improvement in heart rate.
Rates improved wtih addition of amiodarone to betablocker and calcium channel blocker.
This course became difficult as pt was found to be not absorbing PO pills (found whole in the stool) and meds were continually uptitrated and pt had large GI losses/dehydration and was continually given IVF.
In addition, pt developed a significant ileus and he was made strict NPO and placed on standing IV metoprolol.
He did well on this and when his ileus resolved, he was continued on oral metoprolol with good control of his heart rate.
He was started on IV heparin.
He was started on PO coumadin and will require therapy for at least 3 months after discharge.
His IV heparin was changed to low molecular weight heparin and this will be used to bridge him until the coumadin is therapeutic.
Additionally, there was low suspicion for development of acute clot as patient was on heparin ppx and had had a recent CTA.
No need to continue mesalamine per GI.
#FEN-due to excessive GI losses-NGT and diarrhea, I/O's were closely monitored and pt was given aggressive IVF-LR.
