Signed Electronically by [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] E on [**Doctor First Name **] [**2132-5-15**] 8:59 AM  Name:  [**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **]            Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 63862**]  Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]                     Date:  [**2132-4-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-9-5**]        Sex:  F  Surgeon:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD 2362  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Gastrointestinal cutaneous fistula, desmoid tumor of abdominal wall and desmoplastic reaction throughout her abdomen.
She fistualized following the last operation with an enterotomy which probably was not closed quite as well as it might have been, owing to the difficulty of where it was in the loop below the ileostomy.
We were able to resect that loop and bring up a new loop of ileum for a new ileostomy which was patent and was not involved with the desmoid.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Under satisfactory general anesthesia the patient was placed supine and prepped and draped in the usual manner.
We then turned our attention to the right side and then freed up the subcutaneous tissue and a very vascular abdominal wall with a desmoid which was approximately 13-15 cm long and probably 10 cm wide.
After the adhesions were lysed and we had taken down some of the desmoid and freed up the entire small bowel although not from the desmoid mass, which was in the mesentery actually from the top to the bottom, we had been able to resect the ileostomy and bring it back and see that there were several areas of fistula in the ileostomy which we had 3 in all, including 2 which were chronic and 1 which I suspect we did taking down the ileostomy.
We were able to resect this segment of the ileostomy and get back to reasonable bowel all of the desmoid was in the base of the mesentery.
The ileostomy was then grasped with three 3-0 silks but we could not maneuver it into the old ileostomy because it would not reach and so we would close that later and then create a new opening for the ileostomy about 4 inches down the abdomen and this was done by making a cruciate incision in the abdominal wall which had a desmoplastic reaction as everything else she had did.
We then continued with lysis of adhesions until we were certain that we had gotten the ileostomy down to the end and that we could do a new ileostomy and also to try and eliminate as many areas of obstruction with the desmoid as we could.
Two areas of enterotomy, 1 on the right side, and 1 which I am certain was an enterotomy but may have simply been an area where she had an old abscess were then closed with interrupted 4-0 silk and 5-0 Prolene.
Drain was placed down to the left lower quadrant where the questionable enterotomy was.
After this I carried out a feeding jejunostomy in the right upper quadrant in a loop that I thought was close to the ligament of Treitz that I could find.
We then were able to irrigate the abdomen and place [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain in the lower quadrant so the jejunostomy would Witzel with five or six 4-0 silk sutures and bring it up out through a stab wound of the anterior abdominal wall in the left upper quadrant.
We then brought the ileostomy out through the lower wound finally and maturing it after the manner of [**Doctor Last Name **] with four three-part sutures and then taking out the staple line and then two-part sutures which we then amplified to get a good fit from the ileostomy.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was then placed over the fascia, 3-0 Vicryl to the subcutaneous tissue and 4-0 Monocryl with subcuticular closure.
The drains were sewed in place with 3-0 nylon.
The #19 [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was placed on her right and left lower quadrants.
REPLACEMENT:  She received 6 units of packed cells, 4 units of fresh frozen plasma, 500 cc of 5% Albumisol and 1500 cc of crystalloid.
She received vancomycin, gentamicin and Fluconazole.
PROCEDURE:  Cystoscopy, bilateral retrograde pyelogram, left ureteral stent placement, left ureteroscopy.Attempted right STent Placement  ASSISTANT:  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 63866**], MD.
INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  This is a 36-year-old female with a history of multiple surgeries, external beam radiation and desmoid tumor throughout her retroperitoneum who has long standing bilateral hydronephrosis (right worse than left).
She presents for bilateral ureteral stent placement.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was seen in the preoperative area and marked and consented as per hospital policy and brought to the operating room.
After adequate general anesthesia, she was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and 120 grams of Gentamycin was given intravenously.
Her genitalia were prepped and draped in a standard sterile manner; the vagina was filled with a whitish discharge which was thoroughly cleaned before the procedure began.
First retrograde pyelograms were performed using the cone tip catheter in bilateral ureteral orifices.
A 0.038 stent wire was attempted to be placed up into the ureteral orifice up to the kidney, however, this failed.
The wire was easily passed up to the kidney and a 6x24 ureteral [**Last Name (un) 63610**] stent was placed over this wire.
Attempts at grabbing the stent was futile and the decision was made to place a second wire into the ureteral orifice and perform ureteroscopy.
A second [**Location (un) **] wire was placed up into the ureter freely and the balloon dilator was used to balloon open the ureteral orifice.
The ureteral stent was visualized [**Last Name (un) 63867**] forceps was used to grab it atraumatically and to bring it down into the bladder.
After this was in notably good position, it was reinspected using fluoroscopy and the upper curl was in the renal pelvis.
At this point, attention was given again to the right ureteral orifice where a angled glide wire was used to intubate the ureteral orifice which passed into the renal pelvis with some difficulty;  an open ended ureteral stent was placed approximately half way up the ureter.
After many attempts, the angled glide wire was finally passed up into the kidney, however, we were unable to pass the 6 French open ended catheter.
She tolerated the procedure well.
She was subsequently treated for a long period of time with Gleevec.
She was also treated with interferon for about two and a half years and then sulindac remotely.
She was eventually discharged after many months in the hospital; however, spent about a month at home and then began to  have fevers and chills and was re-admitted on [**2132-4-9**] with probable intra-abdominal infection.
She has been treated with antibiotics with amp, gent, and Flagyl for several days.
With regard to her desmoid tumor, she has been on tamoxifen 120 mg daily and sulindac 300 mg daily for this and she has had some  decrease in size by the CT on [**2132-4-10**].
There is a catheter in the fistula as well as an ostomy bag overlying it.
Albumin 1.9, calcium 7.4, TIBC 163, and ferritin 53.
We discussed with her the tamoxifen and sulindac and we feel that she is not getting any benefit with 120 mg daily of tamoxifen and that the dose could be decreased to 20 mg daily and this will help to decrease her hot flashes.
Once she is improved and healed from these complications, we would entertain using chemotherapy to induce a response.
She is having a very slow and expected small response to tamoxifen and sulindac, and if she has a stabilization of the response or actual growth, it would be beneficial to start chemotherapy with a doxorubicin-based regimen.
Currently, though, she is not in a position to receive cytotoxic chemotherapy with the ongoing fistula and infectious issues.
She was kept NPO on TPN (cycled over night).
A CT scan on HD 2 showed no evidence for discrete rim-enhancing or gas-containing fluid collection/abscess within the abdomen or pelvis.
On HD 3 she was given a soft solids diet.
She was started on Ampicillin, Gentamycin and Flagyl empirically.
She was switched form Ampicillin to Fluconazole.
On HD 13, she was switched to clears only and NPO after midnight for an operation to be done the next day.
On HD 14 Meropenem was added and she had the following operations: Resection of the abdominal wall desmoid; exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions (3/1/2 hours), takedown ileostomy, small bowel resection, resection of fistula and end ileostomy.
Her ileostomy was viable.
Flagyl and Gentamycin were discontinued.
On POD 2 tube feeds were started at 10cc/ hour and advanced to 20cc/ hour.
Fluconazole was stopped and she was off all antibiotics.
On POD 3, tube feeds were advanced to 30cc/ hour.
Her ileostomy put out 950 cc.
On POD 5 she was kept NPO and tube feeds were held.
On POD 6 her 1:1 fluid replacements were discontinued.
On POD 7 her epidural was removed and she was started on PO Dilaudid.
On POD 9 she was started on PO iron and epogen for anemia.
A heparin drip was started (goal PTT 60-80).
She was started on Minocycline.
On POD 23, her ostomy output was increasing and her J tube output was decreasing.
Her J tube put out 1100 and her ostomy put out 560.
On POD 29, her J tube was clamped every 2 of 4 hours.
On POD 48 she was taken to the operating room where she underwent cystoscopy, bilateral retrograde pyelogram, left ureteral stent placement, left ureteroscopy, and attempted right stent placement.
They were unable to place the right ureteral stent due to stricture.
She tolerated the procedure well.
Gentamycin irrigation of JP drain was started.
On POD 55, Ciprofloxacin and Aztreonam were started for the previous JP drain culture of Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas.
Vancomycin and Flagyl started, one dose of gentamycin was given.
Fluconazole was added to her antibiotic regimen.
She responded well to antibiotic treatment and hydration, and on POD 68 she was taken back to the floor.
On POD 69 her foley catheter was removed, a fistulogram was performed, and her J-tube was replaced.
On POD 79 she was seen by the oncology service and they recommended continuing tamoxifen, as the desmoid lesion seemed to be regressing on this therapy.
She remained afebrile, her nutritional status was good and her JP drainage was decreasing.
A dose of cholecystokinin was given to clear out the gallbladder.
Her ostomy was dilated; a catheter was placed and sutured to keep her ostomy open.
On POD 111, in planning for discharge, we stopped her Aztreonam and started PO Ciprofloxacin.
She was started on Meropenem and Fluconazole.
A trial of Bactrim DS was given, which she tolerated well, and her Aztreonam was discontinued.
Her oncologist office was contact[**Name (NI) **] with regard to monitoring her Coumadin therapy and other medical issues.
