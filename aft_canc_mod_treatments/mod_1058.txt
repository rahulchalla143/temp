He reportedly refused antibiotics when awoken, then became agitated and combative at midnight last night, throwing objects around his room and screaming at his caretakers.
Chemical restraint with haldol was unsuccessful.
He was placed on a section 12 by psychiatry and sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management.
Solumedrol 125 mg IV, combivent nebs x3, ampcillin 1g, vancomycin 1g, cefepime 2g, levofloxacin 750 mg, and enoxaparin 80 mg. Vitals prior to transfer were 108, 121/90, 28, 100% (supplemental O2 not recorded).
Denies chest pain, dyspnea, cough, palpitations, fevers, chills, leg pain, or constipation.
OMR note written by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of hematology/oncology on [**2191-9-26**] indicates that the patient had been declining clinically at rehab, including worsening renal function, dyspnea and performance status, and his sister [**Name (NI) 382**] at the time) had decided to refocus his care on comfort measures.
PET scan revealed FDG avidity at the periphery of the mass, with an FDG-avid paratracheal lymph node - [**2189-7-31**] cervical mediastinoscopy, multiple lymph nodes neg for malignancy (report not available).
Pt declined RUL lobectomy - [**2189-11-3**] new moderate right-sided pleural effusion; right lung nodule increased from 6.6 to 7.7 cm and was again noted to have broad contact with the chest wall - [**2189-12-2**]: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] again saw the patient and recommended a right thoracotomy and RUL lobectomy.
In the multidisciplinary thoracic oncology conference, it was felt that the patient would most likely require a right pneumonectomy given the extent of his tumor.
- [**2190-2-4**]: A repeat bronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound was performed for diagnostic purposes, with a biopsy of the right upper lobe mass revealing poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with immunostains positive for P63 and CK7 (weak), negative for TTF-1.
Two sets of washings were negative, but brushings were positive for malignant cells.
- [**2190-3-4**]: The patient began weekly carboplatin (AUC 2) and paclitaxel (50mg/m2) given concurrently with radiation therapy.
Required prednisone taper due to severe radiation pneumonitis.
[**Month (only) **]-[**2191-1-25**]: Treated with carboplatin, gemcitabine, with doses intermittently held for LFT abnormalities.
[**2191-4-24**]: Chemo with vinorelbine .
Severe traction bronchiectasis related to post-radiation therapy changes has mildly improved.
[**Date range (3) 34677**]: Hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] for enterococcus mitral valve endocarditis and T12-L1 diskitis/osteomyelitis.
Treated initially with ampicillin and gentamicin, with gentamicin discontinued due to impaired renal function.
Six-week course of ampicillin is scheduled to end on [**2191-9-16**].
He had a right internal jugular  and axillary vein thrombosis, associated with his right sided port-a-cath, which was initially diagnosed at [**Hospital3 34678**] on [**2191-7-29**], and has continued on Lovenox for treatment.
He was seen by cardiology for NSVT, mitral valve endocarditis, and was started on metoprolol for rate control.
He was seen by cardiothoracic surgery for consideration of mitral valve repair, with outpatient followup planned.
-History of gunshot wound for which a large abdominal surgery was required -Hypertension, stable.

Electronically signed by [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD, Interpreting physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2191-10-10**] 14:26  ==============================================================     Brief Hospital Course: ICU Course: This is a 71 year old man with a history of Enterococcus MV endocarditis with blown posterior mitral leaflet s/p six weeks of Ampicillin, continued stay at rehabilitation, who now presents with worsening dyspnea and concern for heart block, found to have GPC blood stream infection in the setting of a mid-line IV catheter.
He was not a candidate for permanent or temporary pacer given his bloodstream infection, and will not be until he completes his course of treatment for his blood stream infection.
Repeat TTE showed probably vegetation, though difficult to discern from previous echo findings for endocarditis.
TEE was not done as he is not a candidate for cardiac surgery (as documented in chart) and the risks of the procedure were felt to outweigh the benefits).
Instead, he will receive empiric 6 week course for endocarditis.
-Mitral regurgitation/CHF exacerbation: Patient was aggressively diuresed and received afterload reduction with imdur and hydralazine.
At goals of care meeting, decided pt was "no CPR indicated," but would intubate.
Floor Course: # endocarditis/MR: Mr. [**Known lastname 34674**] was maintained on vancomycin for a planned total 6 week course.
His ventricular ectopy was controlled with metoprolol tartrate 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Afterload reduction with imdur and hydralazine was continued.
Was on gentamicin for several weeks which corresponded with creatinine elevation.
This agitation required antipsychotic therapy with risperidone and haloperidol, and manifested as suicidal ideation as well as aggressive actions.
Throughout his 5 day stay on the floor (after being called out to the unit), Mr. [**Known lastname 34674**] did not require antipsychotics or restraints.
