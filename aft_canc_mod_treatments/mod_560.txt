She underwent pericardial drainage of exudative fluid and was subsequently admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit.
Pulmonary team was consulted and performed bed-side ultrasound which demonstrated a small amount of pleural fluid which was felt to insufficient to explain her degree of dyspnea.
Her dyspnea and hypoxia were rather felt to be attributable to extended malignant involvement of her lung possibly worsened by post-obstructive lung infection.
After discussion with the patient, her family and the out-patient oncologist decision was made to focus on comfort measures only and code status was changed to DNR/DNI.
Palliative care services were consulted and patient was treated overnight with Lorazepam and opioid drips for maximal comfort.
