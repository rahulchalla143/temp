Pt was admitted on [**7-14**] for high dose IL-2 therapy.
However, pt became hypotensive requiring dopamine with initial episode of A fib on [**7-17**] and occ V tach.
ICU course: While in ICU cardiology was consulted and recommended Amniodarone 150 bolus followed by 400 mg PO TID for 3 days then 400 po BID x 1 week, with a 1 month course.
Additionally, surgery was consulted on [**7-20**] for abdominal pain with concern for ischemic bowel given hypotension and elevated lactate, but surgical intervention was indicated at that time.
TPN was started on [**7-22**] for poor oral intake and rapid weight loss.
Therefore pt was treated with a 10 day course of levofloxacin and flagyl.
For concern of sepsis, pt received decadron while in ICU, but it was rapidly tapered once out of ICU and then discontinued without side effect.
Additionally pt had hypernatremia that was managed with free water boluses and encouraging PO water intake.
Pt was evaluated by cardiology that recommended loading with amnoidarone IV and continuing on PO which was done.
Exam continued to be suggestive for pleural effusion on discharge, but given that the patient was asymptomatic no repeat thoracocentesis was done.
However, cytology was negative both times as was gram stain and culture.
Pt will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1729**] for further management of his renal cell carcinoma.
