He was diuresed with IV lasix and his fluid balance was approximately -700 mL for LOS in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
He was continued on prednisone for presumed COPD exacerbation, and continued empirically on levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia.
Diuresis was continued first with IV, then with PO lasix.
He was seen by radiation oncology and he was rescheduled for Cyberknife radiation therapyi for his non-small cell lung cancer.

- continue Levofloxacin for empiric treatment of PNA for two days, pneumonia appears less likely given hosp course and lack of CXR changes - Supplemental O2 to keep O2 sats >93% - Per IP no indication for stenting, R pleural effusion to small for thoracentesis.
- Robitussin, Tessalon pearls as needed for cough .
Lung Cancer - scheduled for Cyberknife on [**2123-2-5**] - to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5565**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Oncology, may undergo chemotherapy if radiation therapy tolerated.

this admission than converted to sinus after 1x IV 10 mg diltiazem.
