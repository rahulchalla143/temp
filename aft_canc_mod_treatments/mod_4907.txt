History of Present Illness: This is a 51-year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant for laryngeal cancer s/p radiation and chemotherapy, COPD, hypertension, narcotic dependence, now ventilator dependent with a tracheostomy tube, transferred from [**Hospital **] rehab for difficult suctioning and worsening respiratory distress.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was first diagnosed with laryngeal cancer about 2.5 months ago, and has had a complicated medical course since that time; he was initially treated with Taxotere, cisplatin, and infusional 5-FU but missed multiple treatments due to hospitalizations and infections.
Most recently he has had c.diff and is currently on vancomycin through his G-tube.
Respiratory therapy attempted to suction and "bag him," but initially met a lot of resistance.
Patient is unable to provide detailed history due anxiety and subsequent sedation after procedure.

Your breathing tube was noted to be compressed against your trachea (wind pipe), and this was the reason you had difficulty breathing.
It is very important that any future movements or changes in your trach tube should be done in the operating room.
Please follow with interventional pulmonology as needed.
