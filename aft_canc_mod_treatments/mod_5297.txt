This happened at the beginning of [**Month (only) 359**] and his Lasix was increased from 40 to 60 daily.
Upon arrival to the ED he was found to be hypotensive with hyperkalemia and ARF (Cr ~4 from basline of 1.2)  He was sent to the floor, diuresed and then sent to the ICU after he was hypotensive requiring dopamine and vasopressin.
He had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed on [**11-19**] and had renally dosed dopamine.
He was thought to be fluid overloaded and had a transudative thoracentesis (amount removed unknown).
He was aggressively diuresed with Lasix and renally dosed Dopamine.
He had also been recieving  Zyvox for presumed pneumonia and solumedrol 60 mg q6h for presumed COPD.

Lymph nodes, 4L, biopsy (A-C): Metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasm, most consistent with carcinoid tumor, in two of ten lymph nodes/lymph node fragments.
Lymph nodes, 7, biopsy (D): Metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasm, most consistent with carcinoid tumor, in three of four lymph nodes/lymph node fragments.
Lymph nodes, level 7, biopsy (E): Metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasm, most consistent with carcinoid tumor, in one of two lymph nodes/lymph node fragments.
Note: Immunohistochemical stains show the tumor cells are diffusely positive for synaptophysin and chromogranin and are negative for CK 7 and TTF-1.
There persists opacification of the left perihilar and left lower lung, likely representing combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, although underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.
[**2163-11-25**] CXR: REASON FOR EXAM: Status post mediastinoscopy and bronchoscopy.
A small left lower paratracheal collection containing fluid and gas could represent post- procedural changes.
Correlation with recent procedure and clinical symptoms recommended.
Status post left lower lobectomy with fibrotic changes and atelectasis noted in the left lung.

POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE PREPARATION (Final [**2163-11-24**]):       NO FUNGAL ELEMENTS SEEN.
Thoracic Surgery had been contact[**Name (NI) **] and was interested in seeing the patient and deemed that he would be most appropriate for MICU given his ongoing ARF.
While in the ICU his renal function improved with gentle intravascular hydration.
His digoxin was therefore discontinued.
While on the medical service, the patient was brought to the OR on [**2163-11-23**] for Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage  of the left upper lobe, cervical mediastinoscopy and bronchoscopy.
He was treated with Chest PT, IS and suctioning for the thought of possible mucus plugging.
At 8am on [**2163-11-24**] the patient underwent unremarkable bronchoscopy by IP.
In ICU on [**11-25**], patient underwent upper airway suctioning, along with albuterol, ipratropium, and mucinex treatment.
He utilized incentive spirometry as well.
Though he did not spike a fever or develop a leukocytosis, he was started on empiric coverage for hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn.
His respiratory status continued to improve, and he was weaned down to 2L NC O2, and often maintained O2 sats > 94% on room air at rest.
Received 4 days of vanc/zosyn for presumed HAP coverage in setting of hypoxia and increased sputum production, this was d/c'd [**11-28**] with no additional fevers and decreasing sputum.
He was continued on ipratropium nebs, mucomyst nebs, guaifenesin, incentive spirometry.
During his stay, his oxygen requirement was weaned, now requiring 2L NC only intermittently.
Will continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs on a prn basis.
Hypernatremia: Na as high as 150, did decrease with IVF but still mildly elevated on transfer to floor.
IV hydration stopped at this time and POs encouraged given risk of CHF.
His mediastinal lymph node biopsy results were consistent with carcinoid.
Digoxin was discontinued in setting of diastolic CHF.
HR was well controlled without meds on transfer from ICU.
Added Metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**11-26**], though this was d/c'd [**11-27**] for episodes of bradycardia to 30s.
Added 12.5 Metoprolol SR [**11-28**], which he has tolerated well.
He did have some increased edema during his stay on the medical floor, and was given TEDs stockings and encouraged to ambulate.
He also received 40 mg IV lasix x 1 [**2163-11-28**], and an additional dose of 40 mg po on [**11-30**] and 40mg IV on [**12-1**].
The long-term goal remains to minimize diuretics, but use extreme caution with fluids as pt is exquisitely volume sensitive due to severity of dCHF.
Discharged with instructions to continue home lasix (40 mg) for 3 days with monitoring of daily weights and chemistries, this may need to be reassessed and monitored.
His heparin was held after surgery.
He was restarted on coumadin 1.25 mg daily on [**11-26**].
Diuresis minimized on the floor, received 40 mg IV lasix and 40mg PO lasix on two occasions with good diuresis, pt maintained blood pressures.
The goal continues to be to minimize diuresis to prevent excessive preload reduction.
