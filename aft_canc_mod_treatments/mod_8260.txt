Hospital stay complicated by Afib with RVR managed with a dilt drip, and he was started on coumadin.
He did not get blood transfusion prior to transfer.
He was being for placement of a G-tube.
He had a worsening respiratory status today requiring a non-rebreather, with which is O2 improved and he was thought stable.
On arrival to the MICU, patient was responsive, following commands and complained RUQ pain.
His respiratory status worsened with development of stridor, so anesthesia was called.
Intubated for airway protection.

Tracheostomy tube terminates in the proximal trachea, with surrounding retained secretions.
Left PICC again terminates in the high right atrium, and a left internal jugular dialysis catheter ends in the lower SVC.
Incidental note is made of a bovine aortic arch.
There are moderate calcifications in the thoracic aorta and coronary arteries.
Examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, but reveals tiny stone in the gallbladder neck, as well as a percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube.
A surgical drain is seen coursing into the mid abdomen.
Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema, tracheostomy tube, double lumen hemodialysis catheter.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 51yo male with Stage IV squamous carcinoma of the tonsil, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with stridor, bacteremia, hypotension, and pancytopenia.
His MICU course was complicated by ARDS, intubation and subsequent tracheostomy, volume overload, pneumonia, tachycardia and AMS.
He had completed a 14-day course of Zosyn for HCAP (MSSA and GNRs), last dose 5/11.
He was then started on Bactrim for Acinetobacter/Stenotrophomonas as well as Cefepime for Pseudomonas in the miniBAL.
His respiratory status began improving due to fluid removal with HD and increased movement (getting into the chair).
He had b/l chest tubes placed by IP, removed several days later once drainage ceased.
He had a trach placed on [**3-27**].
We progressively weaned his vent settings, and on the day of d/c he was on 40% FiO2 and 8 of pressure support and 5 of PEEP.
Pt was started on seroquel during intubation given agitation and delirium; can be weaned down as tolerated.
Infectious disease was consulting along with the primary team, and agreed with the following Abx regimen to treat PNA attributed to pseudomonas/stenotrophomonas/possible invasive aspergillosis:  Abx regimen and projected duration: - Sulfameth/Trimethoprim Suspension 120 mL PO/NG QHD - Cefepime 1gm IV q24h (give after HD on HD days) start date: [**2124-3-29**] stop date:  [**2124-5-10**]  - Voriconazole 200mg PO q12h start date: [**2124-4-12**] stop date:  ongoing pending [**Hospital1 18**] ID f/u .
He was initiated on HD [**3-30**] and had a HD-line placed.
Thus, he needs to be monitored for signs of kidney recovery (including better UOP and improvement in pre-HD labs), as well as avoidance nephrotoxins and contrast.
Therefore, his Port-a-cath was removed by surgery right after admission to [**Hospital1 18**].
Subsequently fhe developed VRE bacteremia, likely from GI translocation in setting of GIB peri-admission.
He was briefly on Daptomycin, but was switched to a 2-week course of Linezolid day 1=[**3-30**] (out of concern that Daptomycin was only bacteriostatic at his MIC).
TTE negative for vegetation, and TEE was not performed as there was no strong suspicion for endocarditis.
RIJ CVL was removed [**2124-3-21**], placed a new LIJ CVL [**2124-3-21**], removed [**3-30**].
After consultation with cardiology, he was briefly started on digoxin without effect, then was switched to amiodarone and metoprolol.
He should be continued on Amiodarone 400 mg PO/NG TID for total 14 days (d1=[**4-11**]), thus until [**4-25**].
He required a total of 20 blood transfusions during this hospitalization (was being transfused for Hct <21).
Multivitamins were given for empiric treatment of vitamin deficiency, which would have been less likely.
If pancytopenia continues or worsens, can consider a bone marrow biopsy for diagnosis.
Abx regimen and projected duration: - Sulfameth/Trimethoprim Suspension 120 mL PO/NG QHD - Cefepime 1gm IV q24h (give after HD on HD days) start date: [**2124-3-29**] stop date:  [**2124-5-10**]  - Voriconazole 200mg PO q12h start date: [**2124-4-12**] stop date:  ongoing pending [**Hospital1 18**] ID f/u .
All questions regarding outpatient antibiotics should be directed to the infectious disease R.Ns.
-Pt should be continued on Amiodarone 400 mg PO/NG TID for total 14 days (d1=[**4-11**]), thus until [**4-25**].
He will also need follow-up with his previous outpatient oncologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 110590**], md: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 110591**]) for his tonsillar SCC and low-grade non-hodgkins lymphoma.
-Pt's fentanyl patch was decreaed on [**4-15**] from 100mcg to 75mcg; can increase back if pt experiences pain (was originally started while trying to wean pt off of ventilator).
