Brief Hospital Course: 36-year-old man with plasma cell leukemia, d+119 after ablative (flu/cy/TBI) cord SCT, complicated by skin and gut GVHD, now on velcade (C1D32) for persistent plasma cell dyscrasia in his bone marrow, presented with erythematous eyes and dysuria.
# Dysuria: BK virus from the urine was positive, and so IVF were given for the patient to encourage urination and to avoid clot formation.
# BRBPR: Pt developed BRBPR during hospitalization, and out of concern for GVH, flex sig was done with bxs taken.
The patient was initially made NPO with TPN but slowly weaned up to a full diet prior to discharge as steroids were added.
He was discharged on Prednisone 20BID for his GVHD.
He was also on CellCept 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] on discharge.
Tacrolimus was stopped given concern for autonomic dysfunction and TTP.
We also continued the MMF prednisone was changed as above.
During the patient's treatment for GVHD his IgA level started to rise, peaking at 2072.
He was treated with 2 doses of Velcade and 1 dose of Cytoxan.
Soon after these doses he developed autonomic dysfunction (see below) and so further treatment was held.
# Bradycardia and Orthostatic Hypotension: During the course of his treatment for cavitary pneumonia (see below) and plasma cell leukemia with Velcade/Cytoxan, the patient suddenly developed bradycardia to the 30s and 40s with concomitant, symptomatic orthostatic hypotension.
The autonomics service was consulted and his dysautonomia was thought likely to be chronic with chemotherapy induced autonomic neuropathy with velcade being the most likely cause.
Other potential causes were thought to be tacrolimus, which could cause bradycardia, or XRT effects on sympathetic nerve fibers.
He was started on Midodrine in the ICU but this was discontinued after transfer back to the floor as the patient had supine hypertension.
# Hypertension: Metoprolol was discontinued given bradycardia, BP trended up to 200's and hydralazine was stared.
He was transitioned to nifedipine with SBP in 150's, he will need follow up with repeat medication titration on discharge.
He was treated with Vancomycin with initialy improvement, but developed cavitations in his PNA with fever and Cefepime was added.
Cefepime was stopped when the patient developed TTP (see below) but the patient remained afebrile without respiratory compromise.
ID was consulted and recommended a 6 week course of Vancomycin; he will be discharged with a PICC line to complete this course.
# TTP: After transfer from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] back to the BMT floor, with patient developed TTP with dropping platelets, schistocytes, low haptoglobin, rising LDH and dropping fibrinogen.
The patient had some swelling in his R arm, possibly due to this clot, but was not treated with anti-coagulation due to multiple other medical issues.
Transitional Issues: - He was started on Nifedipine for hypertension and will need BP checks and dose titration - Patient will require two weeks of IV antibiotic therapy with Vancomycin (to complete [**6-16**]) - Patient will need follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] in infectious disease before completion of vancomycin.
