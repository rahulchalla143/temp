- Angio-Seal closure device deployment to the right common femoral artery access site.
There is conventional celiac axis anatomy as demonstrated on previous arteriograms.
The spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys remain unremarkable.
Stranding inferior to the pancreatic head is noted, possibly reflecting the sequelae of prior pancreatitis.
There is a metallic common bile duct stent in standard position, with left lobe pneumobilia compatible with stent patency.
Left lobe pneumobilia is compatible with stent patency.
Known pancreatic head mass is not well appreciated given lack of intravenous contrast.
Tip of the endotracheal tube is above the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 3 cm from the carina.
[**2189-12-23**] - CT Chest  Brief Hospital Course: 61 y/o with metastatic neuroendocrine CA admitted for hydration prior to TACE on [**12-7**], presented to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to what was thought to be hospital-acquired pneumonia vs acute on chronic diastolic CHF vs pneumonitis secondary to a portosystemic shunt communicating from her TACE procedure.
She was intubated for increased work of breathing on [**2189-12-16**].
She was continued on vancomycin which was started prior to her transfer to ICU, and she was started also on meropenem so that both would cover for HAP as well as levofloxacin to cover atypical pneumonia.
She completed a 5 day course of levofloxain and 12 day course of vancomycin.
Meropenem was kept for pseudomonal coverage for a planned course of 14 days.
Methylprednisolone was initiated at 20 mg q8h for possible pneumonitis as patient's hypoxic respiratory failure persists despite antibiotics treatments.
Thoracic surgery was consulted for possible VATS biopsy to obtain a more definitive diagnosis to patient's parenchy infiltrates seen on CXR and CT.
However, no VATS is possible given her clinical status, and the risk outweighs the benefit for patient to undergo open thoracotomy for tissue biopsy.
As her sepsis improved, she was able to tolerate intermittent dose of lasix to diurese the presumed pulmonary edema as her total length of state fluid balance was positive.
Patient initially required Levophed support as well as fluid boluses to maintain her MAP and urine output.
She initially required pressors and IVF boluses for the low urine output.
She gradually improved and was able to be weaned off of pressors and tolerate diuresis with improved and stable Crt.
She was treated with D5W fluid bolus then maintenance with the likely goal of starting free water flushes into her tube feed.
As she was weaned off pressor on [**2189-12-21**].
She was able to tolerate intermittent low dose of furosemide for diuresis given that patient's length of stay fluid balance was positive.
Patient was placed on an insulin sliding scale with 70/30 and regular finger stick blood sugar monitoring.
However, prior to intubation, patient voiced that she would not want to be on the ventilator for a prolonged period of time, and she would give herself 4-6 weeks on the ventilator only if she was unable to be successfully extubated.
At that point Ms. [**Known lastname 52986**] family decided that in light of her continued deterioration and in respect for her clear wish not to have prolonged life supporting care if her lung function was not improving to make comfort the sole goal and will discontinue any therapy not directed at comfort.
