He was started on a 14-day course of unasyn & doxycycline for post-obstructive pna but was ultimately discharged on augmentin.
He was given vanc/cefepime switched to Levofloxacin for a total of 8 day course.
Stool  studies were negative for C. Diff, but he was empirically treated with Flagyl and completed a 2 week course of treatment.
He was initially started on vanco/zosyn/azithromycin out of concern for possible sepsis (given patient has recent pneumonia requiring intubation).
Antibiotics were stopped given rapid improvement of his hypotension and it was thought his hypotension/fever was felt to be related to underlying RCC and immulogical response by his primary outpatient oncologist.
The patient was started on Prednisone 40mg daily on discharge.
Colorectal surgery was called and recommend a CT abdomen.

Also considered adrenal insufficiency given patient on Prednisone taper and adrenal lesion on previous imaging.
He received stress dose steroids and was subsequently transitioned back to his home dose prednisone.
?s blood pressures remained in the 80s-100s systolic despite fluid resuscitation and downtrending lactate.
He was started on vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia.
He was on and off of BiPap for several days, before his goals of care were changed towards comfort.
Then he was given IV dilaudid to relieve dyspnea.
-resolved during ICU stay, continued on PO Vanc/Flagyl .
patient had beside I&D of a rectal abscess by colorectal surgery (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] without complication.
ICU Course: Patient initially presented with presumptive shock due to c.diff colitis, the hypotension was resolved promtply with fluid challenge, however the patient quickly became volume overloaded due to what was found to be new-onset heart failure with an EF significantly depressed from previous studies.
The patient had complained of significant abdominal pain, palliative care was consulted and the patients pain medication regimen was adjusted with excellent symptomatic control.
-hypoxia, tachypnea, tachycardia has been omnipresent [**6-20**] -CTA-Chest revealed new RUL ground-glass opacities c/w likely hemorrhage vs infectious process; the patient was started on cefipime, vanc, and bactrim (for PCP empiric treatment).
The patient has been intermittently on bipap for respiratory distress.
[**6-21**] -Continued progression of respiratory decompensation, CT scan findings were confirmed to be significant worsening of thoracic tumor burden, the patient had an episode of tachypnea and worsening tachycardia overnight which resulted in bipap, additional doses of ativan, and lasix for diuresis.
[**Date range (1) 22999**] -the patient had persistent respiratory distress, palliative care was consulted and the patient was started on a dilaudid gtt for pain and respiratory distress management according to comfort care guidelines; his ativan was titrated back to q6 with PRN dosing maintained.
Abx coverage was continued and micafungin was added - the patient is chronically on steroids and had previously been on chemotherapy.
Despite these efforts the patient continued to decline with persistent hypotension, tachycardia, but improving distress symptoms likely given the increasing titration and palliative doses of IV narcotics.
