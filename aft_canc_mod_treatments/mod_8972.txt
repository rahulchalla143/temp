He was initially intubated after flash pulmonary edema ensued in the ED s/p fluid bolus for hypotension and then put on levophed and dopamine for pressor support while concominantly adding a lasix gtt for diuresis of pulmonary edema.
Stress dose steroids were also initiated as the patient was chronically on decadron for menigiomas.
A central line was placed for adequate pressor administration.
Shortly after, troponin and CK-MB were noted to be drastically elevated at 7.58 and 99.
However, because of goals of care (family did not want major surgery and interventions), no cardiac catheterization was undertaken.
The patient was initiated with ceftriaxone to treat his bacteremia and the steriods were tapered down to his home dose.
The central line was removed and a PICC line was placed for possibility of needing home IV antibiotics.
ID was consulted and patient can go home on PO amox 1 g [**Hospital1 **] indefinitely because he is goign home on hospice.
Before discharge, the PICC line was removed as no IV abx will be given at home.
