CONCLUSION: Status post right thyroidectomy.
Satisfactory position of subclavian introducer sheath.
She was monitored on telemetry for her bradycardia which resolved with the replacement of her pacemaker.
She was on a beta-blocker, furosemide and an ACE-I on admission, but those were held once she became hypotensive.
She was given Lasix 10mg PO BID to aid in her diuresis and her BP was well controlled on that medication.
She received 6L of NS without any improvement.
Peripheral dopamine was started with good effect and she was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring.
She received another 7L of IVF, was started on hydrocortisone and fluorinef for possible adrenal insufficiency and her antibiotics were broadened for possible sepsis.
She was also started on pressors, but was able to be weaned off of pressors after 36 hours.
Once she was stabilized and her pneumonia was improved, she was taken for replacement of her pacemaker which she tolerated well.
Her broad spectrum antibiotics were discontinued after 12 days of levofloxacin and 7 days of metronidazole and vancomycin.
Her fluorinef was discontinued and her hydrocortisone was changed to a prednisone taper to be completed as an outpatient (last day [**10-11**]).
LOW UOP: Ms. [**Known lastname 98288**] initially had low UOP after her fluid resuscitation.
Fluorinef was discontinued and her urine output picked up.
She was originally treated with levaquin as it was felt that its etiology could be either aspiration, community-acquired, or nosocomial (as the patient lives in [**Location **]).
However, once she became hypotensive, there was concern that she might have become septic so antibiotic coverage was broadened and she was also given metronidazole and vancomycin.
She completed 12 days of levaquin and 7 days of both metronidazole and vancomycin.
Her medications were consequently crushed and given in apple sauce in order to improve her compliance.
She was continued on aricept (except during her period of hypotension) and mirtazapine.
COPD: She had albuterol nebulizers available prn for her COPD.
She was continued on a PPI for GI prophylaxis and SQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
She was given senna, milk of magnesia and lactulose for a bowel regimen.
