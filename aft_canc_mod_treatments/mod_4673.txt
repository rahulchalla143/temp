RFA Perclose   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year-old man with CAD s/p PCI w/ BMS to LAD and LCx on [**2146-11-4**] with a recent diagnosis of colorectal cancer with plan for bowel resection today.
However, he developed cardiac arrest during surgery requiring defibrillation and subsequently found to have ST elevations on EKG.
Patient had apparently stopped both plavix and aspirin on [**11-30**] prior to his surgery today.
Per report, patient became hypotensive on pressors with MAP in 40s and tachycardic to 120s after prone jackknife positioning.
He was flipped back supine and got CPR for ~10 minutes, including Epi, Vasopressin, Atropine, a shock for transient VF, and a femoral CVL, with return of pulse and pressure.
He was put on a heparin gtt and amiodarone bolus and was brought to the cath lab emergently on afternoon of [**2146-12-6**].
In cath lab was found to have thrombotic LAD stent with no flow, and thrombotic Cx stent with TIMI 3 flow.
He received a Heparin bolus and Plavix load in the cath lab and a Swan-Ganz was placed.
His heparin ggt was turned off and he returned to the OR to complete proctocoletomy with open perineum and diverting ileostomy.
Today he was noted to be dropping his pressures, so returned to cath lab to have balloon pump placed and angiogram which confirmed patency of vessels.
Upon transfer to ICU, he is on levophed ggt, neo ggt, milrinone and vasopressin ggt.
He is also on fentanyl/versed ggt's for sedation.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - CABG: None - PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: -[**2146-11-4**]: Cath revealing two vessel coronary artery disease.
With successful PTCA/stenting of the mid LAD with BMS and the proximal LCx with BMS -[**2146-12-6**]: Cath revealing thrombosis of both stents s/p export with POBA - PACING/ICD: None 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -GERD -Colorectal Cancer- s/p chemo Xrt in [**2146-7-20**]   Social History: He lives in [**Location 620**] with is partner who is [**Name8 (MD) **] RN.
He has formerly drunk a few cocktails a day but has cut back to one glass of wine at night.
Right groin catheter site c/d/i SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Successful 2 vessel thrombectomy and balloon only angioplasty.
AORTIC VALVE: Aortic valve not well seen.
There is no pericardial effusion   Brief Hospital Course: 78 yo male with CAD s/p LAD/LCx BMS in [**10/2146**] presenting with STEMI in setting of stopping asa/plavix prior to colorectal surgery, s/p cardiac arrest on table, on IABP, pressors, CVVH.
Aware of the poor prognosis and believing that the current maximal supportive care including pressors, mechanical intubation, and IABP would not meet the patient's wishes, family decided to withdraw support and pt was taken of pressors, balloon pump, and was extubated.
# STEMI:  Pt initially presenting for elective proctocolectomy for locally invasive colorectal cancer.
Of note, pt undwerwent successful PTCA/stenting of the mid LAD with BMS and the proximal LCx with BMS in [**2146-11-4**], now presenting with thrombosis of the stents likely in the setting of stopping his asa/plavix prior to colorectal surgery.
Underwent successful 2 vessel thrombectomy and balloon only angioplasty.
He was maintained on asa, plavix and heparin ggt which was changed to argatroban for conern of HIT.
Pt initially on milrinone, neo, levophed, and vasopressin.
He was weaned off levophed, but continued on milrinone, neosynephrine, and vasopressin throughout admission.
He was also started on vanc/zosyn for possible septic component.
He was started on CVVH, but pt was unable to be weaned successfuly from pressors or the balloon pump, and prognosis was discussed with family who understood that recovery was unlikely.
# Ectopy:  Pt noted to have frequent multifocal PVCs on tele overnight [**12-6**] and was subsequently started on amio ggt.
Continued to have ectopy throughout admission and was continued on amio until support was weaned .
# Anemia:  Pt received a total of 7 U PRBC over admission including intraoperatively with a goal ~30.
DIC was considered but ruled out with fibrinogen and FDPs.
# S/p Colectomy for colorectal surgery:  Pt s/p proctocolectomy with open perineum and diverting ileostomy.
Of note, pt with significant oozing from open perineum likely contributing to anemia  Medications on Admission: Ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o.
