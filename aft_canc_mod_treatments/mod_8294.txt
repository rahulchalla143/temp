Additional consideration as a differential diagnosis could be a subtle mass giving a small focus area of vasogenic edema, which could also be evaluated further with brain MRI.
Brief Hospital Course: 47 yo woman with [**Location (un) **] syndrome, s/p colectomy with short-gut syndrome requiring TPN via indwelling tunnelled femoral hickman with recurrent line infections p/w abdominal pain, nausea, increased ostomy output, and recent fever c/w prior episodes of bacteremia and word finding difficulty.
Given that she had not yet completed a course of daptomycin for MRSE (scheduled to end on [**2146-8-26**]) and her past multiple line infections, she was presumptively treated for microbial infecions.
The tunneled line was changed over a wire by IR.
She was started on four weeks of daptomycin, and discharged with ongoing daptomycin and ethanol dwells into the left femoral line.
Cefepime was started in addition to her ongoing daptomycin.
Given her additional recent history of Malassezia bacteremia, she was started on fluconazole in addition to the daptomycin and cefepime.
These antibiotics were broadened further to Daptomycin, Meropenem, and Ambisone per ID recs.
She required 4L NC O2 occasionally to maintain comfort.
The hypotension quickly responded to several 500cc normal saline fluid boluses.
TTE was performed for evaluation of endocarditis but did not demonstrate vegetations.
Treatment was discussed with infectious disease physicians and their recommendations were to continue animicrobial treatment for 4-6 weeks or until infectious disease follow-up.
They recommended treatment with daptomycin given past bacterial infections and fluconazole for past fungal infections.
After completing TPN the line should be flushed with normal saline, then allowed for 2 hours of ethanol dwell, and then either restarted allowed to have heparin dwell in the meantime.
Access: Ms. [**Known lastname 1557**] has a double-lumen tunneled Hickman catheter last changed on [**2146-7-29**] by IR.
Due to her need for pressors, fluid boluses, antibiotics, blood products, and chronic TPN, she had a temporary Quad-lumen central line catheter placed in the left femoral vein for extra access proximal to her tunneled double-lumen Hickman.
Prior to the quad-lumen placement, the TPN line was violated for administration of cefepime and packed red blood cells; the patient could not tolerate antibiotics through the same port as the levophed, even though compatible -- she complained of headaches.
MRI would have been a preferred follow-up imaging study, but patient cannot tolerate MRI studies due to iodine reaction and metal hardware.
This was deferred in the ICU because broad spectrum antibiotics were already being given, and the patient did not appear meningitic.
Given her history of dysphagia, the Trans Esophageal Echocardiogram was not performed as it would have first required an EGD and then a TEE, both of which would have required general anesthesia in this patient.
She was transfused 1 unit of pRBCs in the ICU for a Hct of 19 on [**2146-8-25**].

Given your recent bacterial and fungal infections you were treated with antimicrobial medications.
As a result of low blood pressure in the context of suspected infection you were treated in the intensive care unit with continued antibiotics and medications to support your blood pressure.
You will have follow up with the infectious disease physicians and you will continue antibiotic treatment with daptomycin given past bacterial infections and fluconazole for past fungal infections.
After completing TPN you should flush the line with normal saline, then allow for 2 hours of ethanol dwell, and then either restart tpn or use heparin dwell in the interim.
New Medications: You should take daptomycin and fluconazole for 4 to 6 weeks.
These medications will be written for 6 week prescriptions and they may be discontinued earlier after you have an appointment with infectious disease.
Please seek medical attention if you have redness, pain, swelling, and abnormal warmth around the sites of your ostomy and femoral intravenous line given concern for infection.
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 75498**] Please call your PCP to schedule an appoitnment in the next 1-2 weeks.
