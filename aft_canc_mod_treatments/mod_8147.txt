He was transitioned to long-term anticoagulation with lovenox 1 mg/kg for continued therapy of his PE indefinitely, given setting of malignancy.
Chronic: # Glioblastoma:  He is s/p involved-field cranial irradiation with concomitant temozolomide from [**2179-5-4**] to [**2179-6-15**].
However, given profound fatigue, his neuro-oncoligist will hold off on additional cycles of temozolomide chemotherapy for the time being.
He was continued on his home dose of dexamethasone and keppra upon admission, but keppra discontinued prior to discharge per neuro-oncology recommendations, since it may be partially responsible for his spurts of anger, he has not had any seizures yet, and peritumoral edema appears to be controlled well with dexamethasone.
