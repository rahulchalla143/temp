Admission Date:  [**2179-11-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-11-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2105-3-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from [**Hospital6 17032**] for management of sepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness:     The patient is a 74 year old female with a past medical history significant for CAD, CHF (EF 45%), COPD, and who was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2179-10-24**] until [**2179-10-30**] for multiple problems, including MRSA bacteremia complicated by mitral valve endocarditis, right upper lobe pneumonia, and ST elevation myocardial infarction.
During her last hospitalization, initial plans for cardiac intervention were deferred due to sepsis, hypotension, and the discovery of high grade MRSA bacteremia.
Her hospital course was notable for periods of hypotension (SBP 70-80s), requiring IVF and low dose neosynephrine.
The patient was given empiric treatment with Flagyl for C. difficile colitis.
She was administered Linezolid instead of Vancomycin for coverage of her MRSA bacteremia.
The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further management of her hypotension and infectious issues.
Past Medical History: CAD (anterior-inferior defects noted on previous stress tests), s/p STEMI on [**2179-10-24**].
Plans for cardiac intervention during recent hospitalization were deferred due to sepsis, hypotension, and the discovery of high grade MRSA bacteremia.
Patient started on Vancomycin [**2179-10-26**].
Patient takes Coumadin daily.

The day of her transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] she had [**4-18**] blood culture bottles positive for MRSA at the OSH and was started on Linezolid at that institution.
She was started empirically on Flagyl for a brief course until 3 C diff toxin tests were negative.
Her PICC line was thought to be a likely nidus for her continued bacteremia and was d/c'd and cultured, but failed to grow an organism.
Her BP was maintained with IVF and Levophed initially, though pressors were quickly weaned off in the first night.
ID recommended changing from the linezolid back to vanc, but adding daptomycin as well and initially gentamycin.
They also recommended getting a head CT to r/o emboli prior to her likely needed surgery for abscess drainage.
CT [**Doctor First Name **] was initially recommended cath in prep for surgery given recent STEMI, but then after further review was not convinced that the pt had a true abscess requiring surgery.
She was intended to have a CABG performed during her MVR and abscess drainage.
The patient was started on beta blockers and aspirin once able to tolerate.
She refused to be intubated, so a BIPAP was placed on to improve her oxygenation, which helped.
She responded well to Lasix diuresis, though became SOB on occassion throughout her stay.
Cardiology recommended beta-blockade and ACEI to reduce afterload, which improved her resp status.
Given the risk of bleed from these lesions will anticoagulated from heparin on CP bypass, CT [**Doctor First Name **] was reluctant to take her to the OR but eventually agreed.
Supratherapeutic INR: pt had been on coumadin as an outpatient for a h/o PEs, but had not had a recent INR check.
Her INR slowly came down as we held her coumadin in house.
On the final day of hospitalization, the issue of percutaneous intervention of the LAD stenosis was addressed with patient and again, patient refused any further intervention, surgery, catheterization, or otherwise.

Furthermore, non-intervened 90% stenosis of left anterior descending coronary artery per patient's request.
Patient will require IV Daptomycin for four weeks following discharge.
- If renal function declines, please check creatinine clearance for re-adjustment for daptomycin dosing.
Continue taking medications as directed.
- In addition, hold Lasix for systolic blood pressure <100.
- Hold metoprolol for systolic blood pressure <100, or heart rate <60.
Followup Instructions: For MRSA endocarditis, patient will require daptomycin therapy for four weeks following discharge.
Dose of daptomycin may require adjustment per renal function.
Patient has declined cardiac surgery or percutaneous intervention (and given embolic cerebral infarctions is not a candidate for thrombolysis or anticaogulation) for severe endocarditis and coronary artery disease, therefore fever and unstable angina are to be expected.
Please draw cultures should patient become febrile and consider broadening antibiotic coverage.
