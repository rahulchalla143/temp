Admission Date:  [**2138-1-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-1-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2111-9-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cefepime  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3918**] Chief Complaint: Fevers, hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central venous catheterization  History of Present Illness: 26 yo man D +199 after single cord transplant for hypoplastic MDS with h/o persistent pancytopenia thought to be [**3-20**] myelosuppression from CMV + antivirals who is now admitted for sepsis.
Initial MDS course was complicated by mucor infection of the tongue with prolonged ICU course for upper airway obsturuction, followed by pericoronitis as well as perirectal abcess.
Was subsequenntly managed with a single cord transplant on [**2137-6-24**] with reduced intensity Flu/MEL/ATG conditioning.
Post transplant course c/b VRE + Coag neg staph bacteremia [**6-/2137**] (treated with dapsone); CMV viremia [**7-/2137**], c.dif infection [**10/2137**] (treated with 14 days oral vanc), admission on [**10/2137**] for low grade temperature attributed to +CMV viremia with prolonged IV ganciclovir --> oral Valgancyclovir course; last admission 10/4-6 for neutropenic fever, CT chest showed non specific minimal peribronchial ground-glass opacity in the left lower lobe, treated with course of levofloxacine; Saw ID [**12-11**] Valgancyclovir was stopped as CMV viral loads remained negative since [**10-21**], was started on valacyclovir for HSV/VZV PPx.
He also continues oral Posiconazole for mucor and monthly pentamidine nebs for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] (most recent [**12-27**]).
This has been attributed to possible BM supression by CMV and/or antiviral meds.
Finally he is thought to be at low risk for GVH and thus stopped immunosupressive meds in [**2137-9-16**] (was on tacrolimus prior).
- got NS X4L, tylanol (1g at 12:00AM),  BP's increased to 91/46,  pulse down to  120's-130's.
- Patient refusing any further IV placements (used translator) - 13:20 - 123, 92/28, 22, 95% RA Temp still 103, + toradol (30mg at 13:30) - prior to transfer started on levophed per peripheral vein.
Past Medical History: - Hypoplastic MDS (deletion 7q and 13) - single cord transplant on [**2137-6-24**] with reduced intensity Flu/MEL/ATG.
- Oral Mucor infection [**2136**]:  infiltration into base of the tongue with bleeding requiring intubation and IR guided ablation of bleeding artery.
s/p excision by ENT.
- H/o C. difficile infection [**10/2136**] - H/o pericoronitis s/p extraction 4 teeth [**2137-1-24**] - H/o peri-rectal abscess s/p drainage [**2137-2-27**] - H/o periodic transaminitis of unclear etiology, though possibly due to iron load from frequent transfusions; has been evaluated by hepatology.
- s/p excision of a mass at the base of his tongue by ENT that was diagnosed as mucor - s/p embolization of lingual artery   Social History: The patient moved from [**Country **] 1 year ago.
Specimen is only screened for Cryptococcus species.
T wave changes in the anterior and lateral precordial leads may be non-specific.
Abnormal R wave progression from leads V1-V3 may be due to incorrect lead placement.
Compared to the previous tracing earlier on the same date, the rate has decreased by 20 beats per minute, the left axis deviation is less marked, and more in line with previous tracings.

[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] Approved: [**Doctor First Name **] [**2138-1-9**] 7:35 PM   Brief Hospital Course: 26 yo man s/p single cord transplant ([**6-/2137**]) for hypoplastic MDS with c/b mucormycosis, CMV infection, c.dif and VRE bacteremia, with persistent pancytopenia likely [**3-20**] myelosuppression from CMV + antivirals who is now admitted to the ICU from home for septic shock.
He was started on broad spectrum antimicrobials including IV daptomycine (h/o VRE) + meropenem (cefepim allergy) + azithromycin (for atypical coverage).
ID was consulted and recommended changing Azithro to Levoflox for empiric Stenotrophomonas coverage.
He was transfused 1 unit of platelets prior to placement of central venous access with improvement to 35.
Of note patient also noted to have transaminities which was attributed to medication effect.
Patient was also noted to have a mild metabolic acidosis attributed to elevated lactate which improved with admistration of IVF.
Patients blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of levophed on [**2138-1-10**].
Per ID consult recommendations, pt initially on daptomycin (for concern VRE), meropenam (for pseudomonas coverage given cefipime coverage), levofloxacin and posaconazole (given h/o mucormycosis).
Daptomycin was given on [**1-12**] given negative blood cultures and inactivated by surfactant, thus inactive in PNA so unlikely MRSA pneumonia.
He was discharged to complete 7 more days of levofloxacin (last day [**2138-1-24**]) and ongoing posaconazole.
He received induction therapy with Ganciclovir IV 240mg IV q12 hours.
He refused to have PICC line placed, so on discharge he was started on induction therapy with valganciclovir 900mg PO BID.
Continued on home posaconazole 400mg PO q12hrs  # DIARRHEA: presented with diarrhea.
Received transfusions intermittently during hospitalization to keep HCT>21 and platelets >20.
He last had inhaled pentamadine on [**12-27**] for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
Once CMV viral load is negative x2 (separated by 5 days between tests), needs 14 more days of valganciclovir 900mg [**Hospital1 **].
