Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for issues with your breathing.
A bronchoscopy was attempted to see if your stent needed adjustment but it was appropriately positioned.
Due to a rare side effect of a medication your oxygen level went low and you had to go to the intensive care unit.
On the floor we adjusted your medications to try and help you deal with your coughing and secretions.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] discussed mechanical or procedural fixes to your swallowing and breathing issues with interventional pulmonolgy and surgery and they have one possible solution that requires further work up.
Your medications have been changed.
Please take your medications as prescribed.
