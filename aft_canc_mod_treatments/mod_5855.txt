The patient's history is notable for Hodgkin's disease at age 27, at which time he underwent mantel radiation and splenectomy.
Complications of radiation therapy included early coronary artery disease in [**2115**], with an inferior myocardial infarction complicated by a left ventricular thrombus, history of left circumflex stent placed in 03/00, ICD implant as well for nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and inducible ventricular tachycardia in Electrophysiology Laboratory.
He ultimately underwent pericardial stripping and received at St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] prosthetic mitral and tricuspid valve.
He underwent a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement after failing to wean off the ventilator in the same month.
Milrinone was attempted at that time because hypotension, Dopamine and Lasix were unsuccessful.
Dopamine and Lasix were successful for a short amount of time, improved left ventricular function and end organ perfusion temporarily.
Ultimately he was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] Rehabilitation for further management and returned to [**Hospital1 1444**] after four to five days of worsening renal function with a creatinine that was 3.4, up from his discharge creatinine of 1.2 and his baseline at [**Hospital1 5593**] of 1.5 and also elevated blood urea nitrogen at 186.

Ultimately, the decision was made not to try that and the patient was dry so he initially received fluid boluses for the goal of improving his urinary output.
Initially, his urinary output was on the low side making 500 ccs in his first twelve hours in the Intensive Care Unit ultimately with the creatinine that stayed stable or elevated to 3.4 on [**2124-1-27**].
We continued to give the patient fluid boluses, checked the fractional excretion of urea given the fact that he was on a diuretic prior to admission that revealed that he was prerenal.
On deciding this, we gave him fluid and the patient started to have a slightly increased urinary output with a total of 796 on his second hospital day although his creatinine remained stable.
The patient had a blood pressure that continued to be on the low side even for him though there have been frequent issues in the past of him being hypotensive while still perfusing his brain and also having good renal function.
We continued to give the patient fluids with mildly improved renal function with a creatinine that went down to 2.8 on [**2124-1-31**].
He received a unit of packed red blood cells during this hospitalization to improve his hematocrit to 35.0.
Throughout the hospital course, the patient also was weaned off his ventilator, ultimately being on a tracheostomy mask for ten to twelve hours a day.
He was started on Bicitra.
Ultimately his Captopril was discontinued and on renal consultation it was noted that the patient had high eosinophils peripherally, eosinophils in his urine, prompting them to discontinue his Zosyn and his Celexa for fear that those were causes interstitial nephritis.
Endocrine was also asked to see the patient because of his profound hypothyroidism with both reduced T3 and T4 and very elevated TSH, ultimately recommending intravenous repletion of his thyroid hormone.
The patient was started simultaneously on intravenous thyroid replacement as well as on steroids on [**2124-2-4**].
Based on the interstitial nephritis, there is a plan to continue his steroids and ultimately to shoot for tapering after two weeks to off.
There is no plan for discontinuing his Levothyroxine intravenous.
He was started on Levofloxacin, Flagyl and Vancomycin, the Vancomycin dosed for levels because of his osteomyelitis in his heel and because of his sacral decubitus.
