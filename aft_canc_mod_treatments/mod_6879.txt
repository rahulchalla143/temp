CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: An endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in place.
Coronary and aortic atherosclerotic calcifications are noted.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Evaluation of solid organs is limited in the absence of intravenous contrast.
However, a nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The absence of intravenous or oral contrast and the presence of a right hip prosthesis severely limit evaluation of pelvic contents, including evaluation of bowel.
The urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter and excreted contrast material.

Oral contrast passes to the level of the proximal transverse colon, and stool and air are seen within the remaining colon.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is a moderate-to-severe amount of artifact related to the patient's right total hip replacement.
There is a Foley catheter within the bladder, which is decompressed.
