History of Present Illness:  59 y/o M hx of CAD s/p stent, hypercholesterolemia, and gastroesophageal reflux recently s/p uncomplicated endoscopy on [**12-13**] who presented to ED with fevers, progressive weakness/paraplegia found on MRI to have epidural abscess and now s/p urgent evacuation.
He had been taking ibuprofen and percocet for pain.
He was sedated and intubated, started on Vanc/Gent and taken urgently to OR for anterior cervical decompression and fusion C6-7 with left iliac crest bone graft and instrumentation.
Blood cx and wound cx growing MSSA, switched to Nafcillin on [**1-10**].
Past Medical History: CAD-x2 stents following chest pain [**2162**], and [**2163**].
The left kidney measures 12.1 cm.
Renal US [**2166-1-15**]: Lesion in question in the upper pole of the left kidney does not meet ultrasound criteria for a simple cyst.
CT neck [**2166-1-20**]: Three radiographs of the cervical spine demonstrate C1-C7.
Patient is status post anterior cervical fusion at C6-C7.
Radiopaque tubing projects over the left hemithorax.
Air bronchograms are visualized within both these collapsed lower lobes.
Noncontrast evaluation of the mediastinum is unremarkable, except for a stent visualized within the right coronary artery.
ECG [**2166-1-15**]: Sinus bradycardia (55) Prolonged Q-Tc interval (468) - clinical correlation is suggested No previous tracing available for comparison   Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 59 y/o M hx CAD s/p stent, GERD s/p endoscopy, hyperlipidemia who presented with C6 epidural abscess s/p decompression with C6-C7 fusion with persistent postoperative fevers, trending down, improving ARF and stable transaminitis.
Epidural abscess w/paresis: MSSA in blood and wound, s/p decompression and fsion [**2166-1-8**] emergently with residual fluid, spinal cord swelling, followed by ortho spine, neurology, infectious disease.
He was initially started on vanco and gent but switched to Nafcillin on [**1-10**] (s/p vanco/ceftaz [**Date range (1) 62834**], gent d/c'd [**1-11**], naf day 1=[**1-10**], 42 day course).
He will follow-up with orhtopedic surgery and neurology and needs hard C-collar for 8 weeks post operatively.
Currently on oxycontin 20mg po bid with oxycodone ir 5mg po q 4-6 hours prn for breakthrough, with neurontin 300mg po q8 and cyclobenzaprine 10mg qhs for pain relief which may need to be uptitrated in rehab.
Most likely [**2-14**] ATN (given muddy brown casts in urine, also given minimal IVF post op and restriction of PO [**2-14**] paresis in the setting of high fevers) vs prerenal vs interstitial nephritis [**2-14**] gentamycin (though initially no peripheral or uine eos noted, elevated % eos [**1-16**]->decreased [**1-17**]).
Has recieved aggresive IVF and was anasarcic on imaging with pleural effusions (improving, in the setting of albumin 2.1).
Out of concern for post-ATN diuresis PO was supplemented with IVF through [**1-20**] when this was stopped and he was able to keep up with oral hydration.
Lastly, one report of nafcillin causing cholestatic jaundice is in micromedex.
EToH contributing, consider further w/u when more stable (though could all be related to acute process) for hemochromatosis (though ferritin elevated as acute phase reactant), ceruloplasmin, alpha-1 antitrypsin, anti LKM, anti SMAb, though now that most LFT's normal likely will not need.
Ortho does not favor surgical intervention.
Chest CT showed possible RLL process but ID not favoring this as culprit, no treatment currently for pna, they recommended tap L AC joint given TTP over this however IR unable to do so given size.
Also ortho tapped his let [**Hospital1 **] joint which was dry and thought to communicate with the AC given rotator cuff tears so thought less likely to be infected based on that.
He will need to continue Nafcillin on discarge for total course 42 days (through [**2-22**]) and have labs monitored (by Infectious disease) while on it.
Hyperglycemia: No hx of DM, BS in 200's most likely [**2-14**] infection and recent OR (stress) though could have underlying impaired fasting glucose not yet diagnosed, started will need to contiue insulin with 8units glargine qhs and adjust this as necessary.
Hemoglobin A1C 5.9. .
At risk for PE as he's had cord infarct, on lovenox ppx, ortho considering filter placement ppx-favoring hold on that for now given fevers but likely will need ultimately.
Wound care: Stage II decubitis ulcer developing over buttocks/gluteal/sacral area, wound care evaluated [**1-14**] and [**1-17**], appreciate recs, maintained on air matress, with washing and dressing changes (q48 hours to sacrum per wound care), freqeunt monitoring, OOB to chair.
