Post-surgical changes underlying the left retro-orbital region, with pneumocephalus and a thin rim of hyperdense material consistent with blood products.
Heterogeneous attenuation material with mottled lucencies ( series 2, im 8 and 9) within the region of the prior retro- orbital lesion is possibly consistent with packing material or foci of air in the soft tissues, though correlation with operative note and close interval follow-up is advised to exclude retained material.
Status post craniotomy and wash out of left retro-orbital lesion.

An MRI of the brain and orbits revealed a 2.8 x 2.7 x 2.1-cm lesion within the left retroorbital space and middle cranial fossa, adjacent soft tissues, laterally and into infratemporal fossa, and preseptal soft tissues, with osseous destruction invovling sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] and intraorbital extension causing mass effect upon the rectus muscles, optic nerve and globe.
was taken to the operating room on [**2186-7-19**] for a left frontal craniotomy and orbital cavity exploration.
