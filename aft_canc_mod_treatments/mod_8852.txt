#) Respiratory failure / ARDS - Patient was intubated for respiratory distress/failure in setting of Septic shock.
She had a Left retrocardiac opacity initially and was started on antibiotics for PNA.
She was maintained on mechanical ventilation during her course.
As her sepsis and DIC progressed she required higher PEEP and FiO2.
She had signs of ARDS and was maintained on ARDS net low tidal volume ventilation.
Esophageal ballon was used at one point to measure pleural pressure and revealed that with PEEP ~18 her transpulmonary pressures were 0.
She remained on mechanical ventilation thereafter with higher PEEP.
#) Septic shock: Patient was hypotensive and hypothermic after transfer and a central line was placed for acess and cvp monitoring.
She was started on meropenam and vancomycin initilly for broad coverage and was switched over to vancomycin after sensitivities returned.
She was maintained on sepsis protocol with goal CVP>12, MAP>65.
She was initially started on levophed, vasopressin and neosynephrine (in that order).
She was given hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone.
She received platelets, prbc and ffp to maintain plt >20k and >50k if bleeding.
She received altogether 21 units of FFP, 8 units of platlets and 4 units of PRBC over her 6 day MICU course.
Lasix was tried with little success and renal service was consulted for Dialysis recommendations.
Several goals of care covnersations were held with the family and dialysis was held off initially.
She was started on lasix gtt and was also given diuril for diuresis.

#FEN: OG tube was placed and patient was given nutrition via tube feeds.
Serial ABGs showed worsening hypoxemia and Acidosis she was given Bicarb and pressors were increased.
