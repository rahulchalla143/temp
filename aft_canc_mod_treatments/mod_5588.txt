Admission Date:  [**2168-2-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2168-3-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2102-5-18**]     Sex:  F  Service:  O-MED  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old woman with a history of metastatic rectal cancer to her spine and liver status post chemotherapy, most recently with FOLFOX last received six weeks ago, status post colostomy in [**2167-11-23**] who presents with increasing right greater than left lower extremity weakness over the period of two weeks.
Additionally, she does report some electrical tingling in her bilateral insteps with head flexion.
(b)  She is also status post laparoscopic colostomy in [**2167-9-23**] as well as Port-A-Cath placement in [**2167-9-23**].
ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN (which causes a rash).
Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
Coumadin 1 mg by mouth once per day.
OxyContin 10 mg by mouth every day.
Oxycodone as needed.
Colace and Senna as needed.
Iron 325 mg by mouth once per day.
Vitamin C.  8.
She uses a walker for ambulating.
Abdominal examination was notable for an ostomy with mild bleeding, although not perfuse.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 65-year-old woman with metastatic rectal cancer to the spine and liver, status post chemotherapy six weeks ago, with two weeks of progressive lower extremity weakness.
Given the absence of cord compression, it was felt that radiation therapy would unlikely be effective.
An electromyogram was done that showed only very mild myopathy; not enough to explain symptoms.
Nevertheless, all steroids were held since admission.
Her muscular pain was treated with OxyContin and oxycodone titrated to control her pain.
Therefore, chemotherapy was started on [**3-10**] to hopefully improve her weakness.
She was started on a low-dose continuous 5-fluorouracil infusion on [**3-10**].
However, several days into her hospital course, blood cultures drawn on [**2-29**] showed 4/4 bottles positive for Escherichia coli, and ceftriaxone was begun on [**3-1**].
She had mental status changes, was tachycardic, and tachypneic; and gentamicin was started.
Her antibiotics were changed to levofloxacin, Flagyl, gentamicin, and vancomycin.
Her temperature came down with the continued antibiotic therapy, and chemotherapy was started on [**3-10**] in an effort to decrease her tumor and therefore decrease the likelihood of macroperforation.
ANEMIA ISSUES:  On the day after admission, after receiving intravenous fluids, the patient's hematocrit decreased to approximately 23.
She received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells, and her hematocrit was now roughly stable.
Due to the small oozing and bleeding from her ostomy site, her low-dose Coumadin has been held and she received 10 mg of vitamin K subcutaneously times one dose.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  Acute renal failure resolved after receiving intravenous fluids.
However, currently, we are continuing to treat her infection with antibiotics and continuing chemotherapy in the hopes that it will improve her lower extremity weakness.
