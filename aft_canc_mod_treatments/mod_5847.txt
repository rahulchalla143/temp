While aware of the potential side effect of BM supression with colchine, we were limited with options for treatment (did not tolerate NSAIDs in past and had active infection and DM so didnt want to do prolonged steroids).

He recieved prednisone 40mg X1 [**6-4**], 20mg X1 [**6-5**] and [**6-6**].
He had significant improvement with this regimen and no symptoms on discharge.
Thus, he did not require any steroids on discharge.
