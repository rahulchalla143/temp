Her HR was as high as the 120s and she began to receive IVF (NS at 80cc/hr to prevent flash pulmonary edema) in case dehydration/hypovolemia was the cause of her tachycardia.
She was put on telemetry and was given 5mg lopressor x2 which broke the arrhythmia and put her back into NSR.
She required 5mg lopressor x3 and 10mg dilitiazem x1 in order to break her rhythm.
The following day, she again went into an atrial fibrillation/flutter and again required a total of 15mg of lopressor and 10mg of diltiazem to bring her back into NSR.
A discussion was held between the patient, her husband, the [**Name (NI) **] attending on call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and Mrs.[**Doctor Last Name 1357**] oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the decision was made to move more towards CMO.
She was continued on levo/flagyl (which she had been on previously for an aspiration pneumonia), and was changed from PO nystatin to IV fluconazole for thrush.
She went into rapid atrial fibrillation again and she and her family decided on no further interventions, including medications for rate control.
She was given oxygen and morphine for respiratory distress and ativan for seizure activity.
