Today he was with his wife who was taking a mental health examination, and reportedly rushing more than usual, and this caused him to have more dyspnea than usual.
Patient was guaiac negative and heparin drip was started.
Patient was additionally given Protonix 40 mg Ivx1, Lopressor 5mg IVx1, 1.2 L NS, and FS ASA.
Status post nasal septal surgery.
Partially occlusive thrombus in the pulmonary arterial branches supplying the basal segments of the right lower lobe, possibly chronic given their eccentric appearance.
CXR ([**2185-3-20**]) - FINDINGS: New endotracheal tube terminates 6.5 cm above the carina.
Started on heparin drip and bridged to coumadin.
Coumadin held briefly for supratherapeutic levels but then restarted.
After transfer back to the ICU and intubation (see below), pt did have significantly elevated INR, requiring vitamin K. INR responded appropriately.
He was discharged on a lovenox bridge while his coumadin dose was adjusted to get him to his goal INR range of [**1-26**].
He ultimately required intubation for 2 days.
He was maintained on prednisone and nebs for his COPD.
He is being discharged on a prednisone taper.
# COPD exacerbation: Patient became increasingly wheezy on exam during the first 1-2 days of this hospitalization and was started on treatment for a COPD exacerbation.
Treated with azithromycin, a 3-day course of solumedrol followed by a prednisone taper, fluticasone, xopinex and ipratropium nebulizers.
A humalog ISS and PPI were started while he was on steroids.
As above, he had worsening respiratory distress after his inital call-out to the floor, requiring transfer back to the ICU and intubation x 2 days.
He was placed on a prednisone taper at discharge.
# Pneumonia: At the time of patient's decompensation and intubation (see above), it was felt that there could be a component of pneumonia contributing.
Restarted chlorthalidone and restarted beta-blocker, which was uptitrated for rate control (see below).
Patient was continued on chlorthalidone.
Initially started on diltiazem without significant improvement.
His home atenolol (prescribed for HTN) was changed to metoprolol for the purpose of titrating.
Diltiazem was also added back prior to d/c for better rate control.
He was also placed on coumadin/lovenox as above for anticoagulation.
Elevated again briefly in setting of lasix then again resolved.
# Hypertension: Well-controlled, home atenolol changed to metoprolol as above.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Nursing Home - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis - Pulmonary Embolism - Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease - Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia  Secondary Diagnosis - Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane) On 2 L of oxygen   Discharge Instructions: You presented to the emergency department after you had an echocardiogram with some abnormal findings.
You were found to have a blood clot in your lungs, which was treated with blood thinners.
Your hospital course was complicated by worsening breathing, secondary to your COPD and a pneumonia, which required a breathing tube for a short period of time.
CHANGES TO YOUR MEDICATION: - CONTINUE your albuterol (ProAir), Spiriva, and Pulmicort - STOP atenolol-chlorthalidone - START chlorthalidone 25 mg daily - START prednisone taper as directed - START coumadin 4 mg daily.
- START lovenox 70 mg twice a day while your INR is below your goal range of [**1-26**] - START metoprolol tartrate 100 mg every 8 hours - START diltiazem 30 mg every 6 hours - START aspirin 81 mg daily - START cefepime/vancomycin for 6 more days, to complete an 14-day course ending on [**2185-4-2**] - We are also STARTING you on nystatin to help with your mouth pain  As above, your rehab facility should monitor your INR level and adjust your coumadin dose to keep you at your goal INR of [**1-26**].
Because your INR was below your goal of 2 on your day of discharge, you are being discharged on lovenox until your INR is within your goal range.
