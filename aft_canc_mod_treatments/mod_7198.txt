She is not on any oxygen at home.

She was ruled out for a myocardial infarction by negative cardiac enzymes on numerous occasions during her hospitalization.
As the patient's dyspnea did not improve, there was concern that the effusion was compromising cardiac output and her ability to mobilize fluid.
Therefore, a pericardial window was placed on [**2162-1-1**] with greater than 200 cc of bloody fluid out, and the drain was left in until [**2162-1-5**].
There was no improvement in the patient's dyspnea after the window was placed and the pericardial drainage tube was pulled.
She was started on metoprolol 25 mg twice a day for both rhythm abnormalities and for improvement of congestive heart failure.
A thoracentesis was performed on [**2161-12-30**] and 600 cc of yellow straw colored fluid was removed.
Although she was not on oxygen at home, she had a consistent three to four liter nasal cannula oxygen requirement throughout the hospitalization.
The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit following pericardial window placement and consideration for Swan-Ganz catheter was undertaken, however, the patient and family opted to pursue a less aggressive treatment course.
The Swan-Ganz was not placed and her volume status, instead, was estimated per clinical examination and radiograph evidence that was available.
Infectious disease:  The patient was treated with a ten day course of antibiotics for presumed pneumonia, which did not improve her pulmonary status.
She is to continue these injections monthly.
The option of a CT abdomen was discussed with the patient and family, who both agreed not to perform the study given the risks of worsening renal function from contrast load and their wish not to pursue surgical intervention.
The etiology of her abdominal pain was most likely functional constipation and she was continued on an aggressive bowel regimen with per rectum medication and enemas as needed.
Her emesis was thought secondary to functional constipation.
During a family meeting, a nasogastric tube was discussed with the possibility of starting tube feeds.
The family, however, did not think this was consistent with the patient's wishes and, therefore, no nasogastric tube was placed.
Likewise, the option of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was also felt by the family not to be consistent with the patient's wishes.
Her outpatient oncologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], did not feel chemotherapy was indicated at the time of diagnosis.
She was instead started on Femara given that the tumor was estrogen receptor positive.
Code status:  A family meeting was held on [**2162-1-4**] and, after a long discussion of the progression of the patient's disease and lack of response to medical management, it was decided by both the patient and her family that she would be "Do Not Resuscitate", "Do Not Intubate" and not to pursue aggressive medical treatment at this point.
Her medications were simplified and she was prepared for transition to a skilled nursing facility with the possibility of hospice care in the near future.
