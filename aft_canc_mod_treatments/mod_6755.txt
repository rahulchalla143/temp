Admission Date:  [**2130-2-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-3-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-3-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: Cardiac arrest   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catherization PEG tube placement Tracheostomy placement Bronchoscopy ICD placement  History of Present Illness: 68 yo male w/ a h/o NIDDM, htn, metastatic prostate cancer to bone, AF, hyperlipidemia, who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED s/p cardiac arrest.
Also complained of increased fatigue following most recent chemotherapy treatment for prostate ca 2 weeks ago.
There he was intubated and received amiodarone bolus 300 mg.
He also received 3 rounds of atropine and 8 rounds of epi.
Also received Mgsulfate, bicarb.
He was started on lidocaine gtt.
While in the ED, patient became hypotensive and more bradycardic and he received an additional 2 mg of atropine along with a dopamine gtt.
On examination, he initially had fixed pupils, with right pupillary dilatation, but without accompanying brainstem signs.
Bradycardic to 40s and lidocaine gtt decreased.
BP fluctuating on dopamine gtt.
L femoral line placed as well as L radial a line.
Other PMHx: # Metastatic Prostate cancer to bone - on chemo x 15 years # atrial fibrillation # gout # s/p cataracts surgery # s/p knee replacement   Social History: Patient is retired but continues to work in the [**Company **] sporting goods vending industry with his family.
ETT in place.
[**2130-2-6**] C-Spine CT: 1.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the anterior, anterolateral, mid to distal anteroseptum walls and akinesis of the apex.
An ICD device has been placed with the leads in the appropriate position, one lead is over the right atrium and other over the right ventricle.
The ET tube is 4.6 cm from the carina and the right PICC tube is in the mid SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: RHYTHM/CARDIAC ARREST On arrival, Mr. [**Known lastname 8071**] was placed on the cooling protocol for cardiac arrest.
He was therefore started on amiodarone but this was stopped on [**2130-3-7**] after developing amiodarone induced BOOP with hemoptysis.
Anticoagulation was held aftetr amiodarone induced BOOP was discovered but restarted after placement of ICD (coumadin and subq heparin).
For his afib he continued to be well rate controlled on metoprolol (when sleeps falls to low 40s but asymptomatic) .
CT surgery was consulted and after evaluation determined he was not a candidate for CABG due to the severity of CAD and lack of targets for anastomosis; therefore his medical management was optimized wtih ACEI, BB, ASA, statin.
Possible intervention was revisited after his significant neurologic progress at which time a rest MIBI was perform to explore possible salvagable regions but the study demonstrated a fixed moderate perfusion defect in the distal anterior, apical and lateral segments; therefore medical management was recommended.
PULMONARY EDEMA Pt had some pulmoary edema seen on CXR as pulm congestion, echo initally demonstrated EF>55%, then a repeat echo demonstarted EF 35-40% with anterior hypokinesis of the anterior, anterolateral, mid to distal anteroseptum walls and akinesis of the apex.
Pt was diuresed with lasix IV.
Pt was started on po lasix prior to d/c with a dose of 20mg daily.
Please titrate this down as tolerated to keep an even I/O balance as pt appears to be euvolemic at the time of discharge.
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Mr. [**Known lastname 8071**] was initially intubated as part of the cooling protocol for cardiac arrest.
He continued to have impaired cognition with dysarthria, however, and was unable to protect his airway with oral intake.
Video swallow evaluation revealed aspiration, and he underwent PEG placement on [**2130-2-21**].
He also required Q30-60 minute deep suctioning for copious secretions, and the decision was made to perform a tracheostomy for long-term care.
Tracheostomy was performed on [**2130-2-23**] without complication.
However, patient had an episode of agitation overnight requiring antipsychotics and benzos and then had worsening respiratory status requiring placement back on the vent.
His mental status then cleared but he still required some minor ventilatory support but was slowly eaned off to trach mask which he tolerated 24 hrs a day for the past 4 days.
A repeat speech and swallow evaluation performed on [**3-1**] recommended holding off PM valve evaluation and swallow evaluation until patient is on tracheostomy mask and secretions have decreased.
ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA: The patient was initially treated with flagyl and unasyn for aspiration pneumonia throught to have started during his cardiac arrest.
On [**2130-2-22**], he was noted to have low-grade fever, increasing secretions, and new CXR opacities concerning for recurrent aspiration events.
He was started on vancomycin and zosyn for broadened coverage, and he received a tracheostomy for improved airway protection and suctioning.
His broad spectrum antibiotics were changed to Augmentin on [**2130-2-24**] with a plan to complete a 7 day course, finishing [**2130-3-1**].
However, pt developed bilateral opacifications and fever prompting us to restart vanc/zosyn and for IR to place PICC given single peripheral access and anticipating 8 day course of IV abx needed which were finished on [**2130-3-9**] with pt remaining afebrile and with some resolution of infiltrates (which in retrospect may have been caused mostly by amiodarone induced BOOP).
His lovenox and coumadin were held and he was transfused a total of three PRBCs.
Pulmonary were consulted who thought thi was more consistent with amiodarone induced BOOP and steroid were started on [**2130-3-6**] which dramatic improvement overnight in symptoms and in findings on CXR with decrease in bilateral opacification.
He was intially managed with beta blockade which was down titrated with addition of amiodarone.
He was continued on heparin drip throughout for anticoagulation and was eventually transitioned to lovenox and coumadin following trach and PEG placement.
Anticoagulation was held in the setting of alveolar hemorrhage and hematocrit drop and restarted coumadin and lovenox once the BOOP had completely resolved.
Neurosurgery was consulted and placed orthotic lumbo-sacral support device.
A hole was drilled in the brace to allow his PEG tube to be accessed easily without removal of the brace.
LEFT DISTAL FIBULA FRACTURE: Ankle x-ray on [**2130-2-8**] revealed a subacute nondisplaced fracture of the distal left fibula, thought to have been sustained during the initial cardiac arrest and fall.
MENTAL STATUS Intially thought to have some level of anoxic brain injury given 30 minutes w/o spontaneous perfusion and GCS of 4 upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] but made tremendous advances and was alert and oriented x3, moving all extremities but with need for significant PT/rehab in recovery.
