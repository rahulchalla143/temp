She recently developed obstructive jaundice which was followed by placement of an endoprosthesis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] during endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography.
Now that her obstructive jaundice has resolved, she has presented for the Whipple procedure on [**2133-3-19**].
Status post appendectomy as a child.
ALLERGIES: Bactrim and Ceclor.
She tolerated the procedure well.
In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient underwent diuresis for her mild congestive heart failure and she also received aggressive chest physical therapy and was encouraged to do incentive spirometry.
She had a low urine output and low blood pressure both of which responded to boluses of intravenous fluid and on postoperative day three, the patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the Floor in stable condition.
Her anesthesia was changed to Dilaudid PCA and her respiratory status was still in need of aggressive chest Physical Therapy and incentive spirometry.
On postoperative day six, the patient was started on Lopressor for high blood pressure and tachycardia.
She also was noticed to have bilious drainage from her [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain.
At this point, the patient although was tolerating sips, was started on TPN for nutritional support.
She was advanced to clears and continued to receive aggressive chest Physical Therapy.
When the patient was noted to have bilious drainage from her wound, she was started once again on antibiotics; this time, she was started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
She tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.
Postoperatively, the patient was continued on Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
She had a decrease in her urine output postoperatively from her wound closure which responded to an intravenous fluid bolus.
Her pain was controlled with morphine p.r.n.
She continued to receive aggressive chest Physical Therapy and incentive spirometry.
The patient was kept NPO on intravenous fluids and continued to receive TPN.
Postoperatively, the patient was also placed on Ampicillin.
Her wound was noted to have retention sutures in place but she continued to have bilious drainage from all portions of her wound, mostly from the right lateral edge of the wound which was in a dependent position.
Postoperatively, the patient was requiring dressing changes approximately every one to two hours and a stoma care consultation was obtained, and at this point it was recommended that the patient have Miconazole Powder applied around the wound edges, followed by Double-Guard, which would protect the skin from necrosis effects of the bilious drainage.
At this point, the patient was also started on Somatostatin in hopes of decreasing the wound drainage.
On postoperative day 17 status post Whipple and postoperative day eight status post wound exploration and closure, the patient was noted to have marked decrease of her wound drainage.
At this point, it was felt that a trial of stopping the Somatostatin was attempted.
The patient, at this point although, continued on Levofloxacin, Flagyl and Ampicillin.
The following day, the patient's wound drainage was noticed to be increased once again and was bilious in character.
At this point, it was felt that her Somatostatin should be restarted and the patient kept on sips for comfort and on TPN to decrease the amount of drainage to her wound.
Her wound drainage had greatly decreased from immediately postoperatively, requiring every one to two hour dressing changes.
The patient was now only requiring dressings changes every six to eight hours.
At this point, the nature of the wound drainage was mostly serous, occasional bilious, but markedly decreased in amount.
At this point, the patient also was noted to have loose diarrheal stools which were sent off for Clostridium difficile and noted to be negative.
The patient was felt stable to be discharged to rehabilitation to continue her dressing changes and to receive nutritional support.
Sandostatin 100 micrograms subcutaneously three times a day.
Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
Total parenteral nutrition as written.
Her dressing change involves removing the old dressing and cleaning the skin adjacent to the wound with normal saline moist gauze, followed by a foam cleanser to the distal end of the wound and patted dry.
Then, following this, Miconazole Powder is applied to the reddened areas and the excess dusted away.
Using No-Sting barrier wipes, the wound edges are cleaned and not covered by stoma adhesive.
She should receive TPN for nutritional support.
Periampullar cancer status post Whipple procedure.
Status post wound exploration and closure.
