Admission Date:  [**2121-7-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-7-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-12-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1363**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea, chest discomfort  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracentesis Pericardiocentesis  History of Present Illness: 50 year old gentleman with metastatic renal cell carcinoma on chemotherapy (axitinib which the patient was told to stop on [**2121-7-15**] given his worsening fatigue), hypertension, Factor V Leiden and PFO.
He is on lovenox for PE.
In the ED he received 1 L NS, Vancomycin and levofloxacin (PCN allergy).
He received fluid resuscitation and pulsus paradoxicus was trended.
IP placed a right pigtail catheter with drainage of 2100cc of serosanguinous fluid.
Cardiology consult team further recommended checking pulsus paradoxus every 12 hour and even though there was no tamponade on echo, pericardiocentesis was performed on [**2121-7-21**] due to the maligant nature and liklihood of future tamponade.
He was persistently tachycardic and received roughly 5L of NS with improvement in his hemodynamics.
Pain control was a significant problem treated with IV dilaudid with good effect.
Vascular surgery was consulted and did not recommend intervention, and instead opted to continue anticoagulation with heparin gtt.
He was broadly covered with vancomycin and cefepime due to a positive urinalysis and persistent tachycardia, but cultures were persistantly negative and his antibiotics were discontinued a few days after to the floor.
There were ongoing conversations between the patient and his family, palliative care and his outpatient oncology team regarding goals of care, as his prognosis was judged to be very poor, with very limited treatment options.
He was initially restarted on axitinib for palliation, but this was later discontinued as patient and his family elected for comfort measures only.
Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - [**2120-7-5**]: presented to [**Hospital6 1597**] with cold left arm, found to have brachial and radial tumor thrombi in his left arm, s/p thrombectomy.
CT revealed a 11.4 x 8.6 cm right kidney enhancing mass with central necrosis and calcification, pulmonary and adrenal metastases and lytic lesions in his right acetabulum and lesser trochanter.
- [**2120-7-24**]: XRT to R hip, 5 treatments - [**2120-8-1**]: Cyberknife to brain mets - [**2120-8-9**]: Laparoscopic right radical nephrectomy with adrenalectomy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**].
Coumadin stopped and pt transitioned to Lovenox.
- [**2120-10-5**]: Started Sutent 50 mg daily, took for 8 days and had side effects.
- [**2120-10-19**]: Re-started Sutent at 37.5, developed diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stopped after 7 days.
- [**2120-10-30**]: Due to persistent nausea, dexamethasone restarted with resolution of symptoms.
- [**2120-11-1**]: Restarted Sutent 25 mg daily, [**2120-11-6**] increased to 37.5 mg daily.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension Factor V Leiden (heterozygous, 3-8x incr risk) Hx of PE while on Coumadin, transitioned to Lovenox   Social History: Married, no children.
walks with cane and walker   Family History: Mother with multiple blood clots diagnosed with factor V leiden mutation on chronic anti-coagulation and s/p IVC filter placement.
Paternal aunt-ovarian cancer-diagnosed at age 65.
Decrease in right pleural effusion following pigtail pleural catheter placement  and development of a moderate hydropneumothorax.
Right basilar pigtail catheter is seen.
Radiopaque densities projecting over the left upper quadrant are felt to represent artifact.
This finding, taken together with the small hyperdynamic configuration of the left ventricle despite removal of most of the pericardial fluid, raises a suspicion for the presence of pericardial constriction, possibly as a result of epicardial metastasis of underlying neoplastic disease.
Brief Hospital Course: 50 year old gentleman with metastatic renal cell carcinoma on chemotherapy, hypertension, Factor V Leiden complicated with PE on Lovenox at home.
He received a thoracocentesis on [**7-19**], and a pigtail drain was placed.
Leukocytosis on admission, but cultures peristantly negative, no improvement on antibiotics (given vancomycin and cefepime).
Pigtail drain pulled [**7-26**]; patient was initially scheduled for Pleur-X [**7-28**] which was cancelled given patient and family's evolving wishes and decision to forgoe invasive interventions.
He was monitored hemodynamically and pulsus paradoxus was monitored Q12H.
He underwent pericardial drainage on [**7-21**] with drainage of 350cc clear fluid.
In the CCU patient continued to have persistent hypotension and tachycardia despite pericardial effusion drainage.
The following day, repeat echo showed no reaccumulation of fluid and he showed no clinical signs of tamponade, so the pericardial drain was pulled.
However in the TTE, the epicardial surface of the heart appeared thickened and heterogeneous which raised suspicion for the presence of pericardial constriction, possibly as a result of epicardial metastasis of underlying neoplastic disease.
He was continued on IVF given his preload dependence and was not symptomatic from his hypotension in the systolic 80s.
Axitinib was initially restarted for palliation and later discontinued when patient made CMO.
# Renal cell carcinona: s/p right nephrectomy, Sutent, Cyberknife, WB-XRT, was on Axitinib for progression on MRI (stopped [**2121-7-15**] for possible contribution to his progressive fatigue).
He takes lovenox twice daily at home.
He was treated with heparin drip while in the hospital for easy on/off with procedures.
Lovenox was discontinued prior to discharge due to falling platelet counts.
# Urine retention: patient reports requiring tamsulosin for good urine output with history of self catheterization intermittently.
He had a foley in place while in the hospital, and his tamsulosin was held.
