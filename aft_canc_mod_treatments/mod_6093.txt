Cardiology consult was obtained on [**2112-1-27**] due to ongoing paroxysms of RVR through the weekend that were becoming difficult to control in setting of patient's mucositis.
Cardiology recommended increased frequency of IV metoprolol as well as a TTE.
Her MM was initially treated with Revlimid, stopped due to question of some worsening of renal dysfunction.
She was then treated with Velcade and Decadron and had significant drop in her paraprotein.

Patient was controlled on dilt drip and loaded with digoxin initially.
She was transferred out of ICU on digoxin and metoprolol 75 TID, which was titrated to optimal rate control.
She was diuresed aggresively with lasix drip, and was negative 6.5 for length of stay in ICU.
Her digoxin was stopped because the patient had altered mental status.
One day after her digoxin was stopped, the patient went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate during a period of agitation.
Metoprolol 5 mg IV x 2 and loading the patient with Metoprolol 100 mg TID brought the patient's rate down, however, her periods of agitation caused her heart rate to increase to 150s again.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended continuing metoprolol and adding amiodarone, diltiazem and a heparin drip.
She was continued on metoprolol tartrate 100 mg TID, diltiazem, and amiodarone with maintenance of sinus rhythm.
In terms of anticoagulation, cardiology felt that she would benefit from coumadin since her CHADS 2 score is 4, however, since the patient is a fall risk, she was not anticoagulated with coumadin.
The heparin gtt was stopped  and the patient was given full-dose aspirin.
**Will need periodic QTc monitoring while on amiodarone and haldol** .
On initial presentation to ICU, patient was agitated and she became increased agitated and delirious, to the extent that intubation was required to proceed with testing.
Ddx included infectious etiology since pt was neutropenic and febrile, medication related delirium, cerebral hemorrhage.
Patient required zyprexa and haldol intermittently with attempts to wean sedation.
Psychiatry recommended Haldol at night in order to induce a normal sleep/wake cycle.
She was being treated with daptomycin for VRE UTI, and this was continued.
She received cefepime then meropenem, micafungin, acyclovir, azithromycin for febrile neutropenia.
She required intubation on [**1-29**] for hypoxia and worsened mental status.
Patient was aggressively diuresed with Lasix gtt, which did improve hemodynamics and respiratory status.
Given difficulty assessing volume status and cardiac function, Swan-ganz catheter was placed.
Patient did better with diuresis and rate control.
Multiple Myeloma s/p autologous stem cell transplant: the patient underwent high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue.
With the exceptions above, the patient tolerated the procedure well.
She also had hypertension which was well controlled on diltiazem and metoprolol.
Fecal cultures and numerous C. diff tests were negative.

Your transplant went well, but you had complications of a fast heartbeat, respiratory distress, infection, and delirium.
You had to be transferred to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation.
You were weaned off the ventilator and you were found to be delirious--you did not remember where you were.
Your medications have changed: -START metoprolol (for your heart rate) -START amiodarone (for your heart rhythm) -START diltiazem (for your heart rate) -START aspirin (to prevent clots in your heart) -START lovenox 40mg daily for 2 weeks -START haldol 5mg at night (to help you sleep)  Followup Instructions: You should followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the neurology clinic in [**2-6**] months.
