History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] is an 86yo M with PMH of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with metastasis to the right lung, with endobronchial disease, s/p broncheal stenting in [**2133**], with multiple episodes of non-massive hemoptysis, and recent rigid bronchoscopy with balloon dilatation of Bronchus intermedius, who is admitted to the MICU with hemoptysis.
He felt feverish and noted maximum temperature 98.2 at home.
He was seen in [**Location (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 19700**] treated with nebulizer treatments and discharged home.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management.
He was not given any blood transfusions or intervenous fluids.
Of note, patient underwent bronchoscopy [**2135-1-17**] with where stenosis of the bronchus intermedius stent was noted and treted with balloon dilation of the right middle segment/bronchus intermedius and tumor ablation with electrocautery of granulation tissue within the stent and in the distal end of the stent.
He underwent a right nephrectomy at [**Hospital1 84018**].
He underwent a rigid bronchoscopy w/ tumor biopsy, debridement, & stent placement [**2133-1-15**].
underwent argon plasma coagulation.
- He had brachytherapy at [**Hospital3 2358**].
- on [**2133-5-27**] he had a metal stent placed by IP.
- on [**2133-6-8**] started on sunitinib.
- on [**2133-6-18**] developed hemoptysis requiring Sutent hold through  [**2133-6-23**] & again [**Date range (1) 36573**].
He returned [**2133-8-25**] & reported scant hemoptysis x 2 days & his Sutent was stopped.
trial of albuterol INH & Pulmonology recommended use of PPI/fluticasone.
At that time  we discussed possibly resuming Sutent earlier than 2 weeks off therapy if respiratory symptoms persisted.
He developed pain at  the site which continued despite use of Tylenol and was prescribed a lidocaine patch.
Notable is interval development of a left adrenal nodule with rim of enhancement given characteristics and rapid growth concerning for metastasis.
- On [**2134-9-30**] pulm rigid bronch revealed his metal stent well-covered with granulation tissue was visualized in the bronchus intermedius.
PMH/PSH: Renal cell Carcinoma Hypothyroidism, Lyperlipidemia, Hypertension.
Status post partial right adrenalectomy, and right nephrectomy   Social History: He is married and he and his wife live on [**Hospital3 4298**].
[**2135-2-2**] Bronchoscopy in brief: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
The procedure was performed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes at the operating room.
The bronchoscope was introduced orally and advanced under direct visualization until the tracheobronchial tree was reached.The procedure was not difficult.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
On the night of his admission he underwent rigid broncoscopy by IP who saw that he had a fractured bronchus intermedius stent with friable tissue around it, causing right main stem bleeding.
In the MICU that morning he had a fever to 100.4, which was believed to be from the procedure, and no cultures were taken, no antibiotics were given.
He was initially mainatined on 2L NC O2 coming out of the MICU, but was weaned do room air.
# HTN: Pt is currently currently normotensive, given hemoptysis will hold antihypertensives until hemostasis has been achieved.
Continued Levothyroxine 100mg Daily.
Unchanged from past, not active during this hospitalization, using lidocaine patch.
Transition Issues:  1) He will require additional instrumentation by IP.
2) At some time the question of whether to restart his Sutent will have to be made.
that will be decided upon by his oncology team in conjunction with the interventional pulmonologists.
3) His amlodopine and atenolol were stopped during this admission due to concern of hypotension and blood loss.

On the day after your procedure you had a slight temperature, but that quickly went down and nothing came of it.
