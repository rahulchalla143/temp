There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis in the basal anterior/anteroseptal walls and hypokinesis of the mid-distal anterior/anteroseptal walls (LVEF = 20%) Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
IMPRESSION: Large circumferential (likely hemorrhagic) pericardial effusion with right ventricular collapse c/w tamponade physiology.
Differential considerations include lymphoma, invasive thymoma, teratoma and less likely thyroid malignancy.
ADDENDUM #1: Fresh tissue sent for karyotype to Women's Hospital Cytogenetics Laboratory, [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14305**], [**Location (un) 86**] [**Numeric Identifier 6425**].
COMMENTS:  Mosaicism and small chromosomes anomalies may not be detected using the standard methods employed.
Chromosome analysis was performed at a level of 400 bands or greater.
ADDENDUM #2:  Stains for markers of embryonal carcinoma (PLAP and CD30) were negative.
Tachycardia eased somewhat with pericardial drainage but nonetheless, ongoing atrial fibrillation with recurring RVR required significant doses of metoprolol to keep in the high 90s/low 100s.
Additionally, it appeared that for a time Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 4143**] was effectively dehydrated because of the extensive extravasation associated with his full-torso rash; IV hydration did help to reduce heart rate during this time.
Boluses of fluid were given cautiously given his 25% EF.
Lasix was added to his drug allergies.
Dermatology was consulted and as the rash expanded, recommended a five day course of prednisone 60 mg daily, which was given.
Symptomatic treatment including antihistamines and topical creams were also given.
# History of PE: Originally the team held coumadin during the initial time in which the pericardial drain remained in place.
The team restarted anticoagulation with a heparin drip to bridge back to coumadin.
At discharge his coumadin dose was 2.5 mg daily and he was discharge on a lovenox bridge.
# CAD: s/p ant MI 10y ago.
Restarted aspirin (after being held by past clinicians because of past stroke), as we judged the benefit of aspirin for CAD to outweigh the risk.
We continued beta-blocker and statin.
# Seizure: Neurontin was continued.
# Hypercholesterolemia: Statin was continued.
# BPH: foley in earlier part of admission; flomax .
# FEN: cardiac diet, replete lytes prn # PPx: initially pneumoboots, then heparin to coumadin bridge # Code: FULL # Dispo: CCU # Contact: wife .
