Brief Hospital Course:  # Brain Mass:  The pt was found to have brain mass at OSH after presenting with mental status changes/loss of consciousness in the setting of heroin overdose and DKA.
He was treated with dexamethasone & phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis.
Etiology of his DKA was thought to be from poorly controlled DM, particularly in the setting of heroin overdose.
He was only on NPH at home without sliding scale.
Shortly after transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], the pt was transitioned off insulin drip.
They recommended continuing NPH along with Humalog sliding scale.
He was discharged on humalog sliding scale and NPH.
His urine tox screen at OSH was reportedly (+) for opiods and cocaine.
Additionally, he states that he has chronic pain, which has been attributed to LE neuropathy, for which he self-medicates with heroin as well as vicodin.
[**Female First Name (un) 71304**] ([**Hospital1 18**] Addiction Counselor) spoke w/ the pt and gave him numbers for addiction resources and methadone clinics.
He was on neurontin and vicodin as an outpatient.
His dose of neurontin was increased during this hospitalization and he was given oxycontin with breakthrough oxycodone for his pain (instead of vicodin).
Because of his pain, he began using a cane while hospitalized.
Pt was tapered off clonidine, which he had been on as an outpatient; he was started on metoprolol; and his ACEi was changed from enalapril to lisinopril.
