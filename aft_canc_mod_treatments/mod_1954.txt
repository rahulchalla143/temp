RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND [**2200-3-25**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Patient's mental status waxed and waned throughout admission, especially during dialysis sessions.
Likely Mr. [**Known lastname **] has some underlying dementia with superimposed delirium in the setting of frequent hospitalizations and medicalizations.
Also possible that there are metabolic derrangements in the setting of frequent dialysis.
All offending medications were discontinued, such as ranitidine.
Efforts were made to orient patient and discontinue unnecessary tethers.

Of note, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was given 5mg of Haldol in the ICU and was unarousable for hours.

THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  Patient had a rapidly dropping platelet count, ever since being started on cefazolin for MSSA bacteremia in early [**Month (only) 958**].
Cefazolin was held and platelet count went up.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was switched to nafcillin with good effect, but antibiotic was finally changed to vancomycin as this can be easily administered at dialysis.
Patient will continue on vancomycin (given at dialysis) through [**4-11**].
Extensive work-up completed on previous admission.
Patient will continue on vancomycin through [**4-11**].

His oral medications can be restarted upon discharge.
Patient was continued on Sarna cream as needed.
# HALLUCINATIONS:  Family states that patient has been complaining of bugs crawling on his skin and over his sheets.
Patient was given low-dose haldol as needed for agitation (can be changed to an anti-psychotic with fewer extrapyramidal side effects if [**Last Name (un) 309**] Body is suspected) and will follow-up with geriatrics as an outpatient.
# ESRD ON HD:  Patient will continue on dialysis Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
Patient will receive vancomycin at dialysis through [**4-11**] or unless directed otherwise by infectious disease.
