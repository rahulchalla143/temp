The patient was discharged from the [**Hospital6 14430**] to the [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital on [**2163-12-16**] on a ventilator with settings of assist control 550 times 8 and FI02 of 40%.
The patient received Atropine and was transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**] for further workup.
On course to the hospital, the patient was started on a dopamine drip and by the time that the patient came into the Emergency Department his vital signs consisted of a temperature of 99.2, blood pressure 96/48, pulse 82, respiratory rate 18.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 99.2, pulse 60, blood pressure 110/60, respiratory rate 16 on a ventilator of assist control 550 times 16, FI02 of 40%.
RESPIRATORY:  The patient presented with respiratory failure and is on a ventilator and trach.
It was decided to continue adjusting the vent settings as appropriate without autopeeping.
The patient did have a .................... stress test that was done with adequate response and so the patient was not started on hydrocortisone 100 mg t.i.d.
given the patient's renal function, the patient was started on aztreonam 1 gram IV b.i.d.
The patient was also started on vancomycin 1 gram p.r.n.
RENAL FAILURE:  The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine anywhere between 1.6 and 1.9.
The renal team was consulted who recommended that the patient would not benefit from dialysis given his overall poor prognosis.
Given the patient's cardiac function, it was decided that the patient would be started back on Diltiazem at 30 mg p.o.
and the patient was also started on hydralazine and Imdur to help control his blood pressure.
Not much can be done about this and so no further intervention was done.
The patient did receive two to three units of packed red blood cells during this hospital course to help with volume expansion and also to maintain a crit of greater than 27.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was on tube feeds at the outside hospital.
The patient's tube feeds were initially held on admission but then were restarted on Nepro per the nutritionists recommendations.
The patient received a bowel regimen and had a bowel movement and his abdominal pain seemed to have resolved.
CODE:  The patient presented to the hospital and was full code; however, given the patient's overall poor prognosis and his multiple medical problems and deteriorating conditions, an extensive family meeting was held with the daughter who agreed that the patient should be DNR (no heroic measures should be performed; for instance if the patient does have an MI or goes into V tach or V fib, we are not to shock the patient or perform CPR).
