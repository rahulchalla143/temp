MICRO:  C.DIFF: TEST NOT PERFORMED AS STOOL FORMED  URINE CULTUREL NO GROWTH  BLOOD CULTURES x 2: NO GROWTH TO DATE   Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 y/o M with a history of metastatic prostate cancer, recent hospitalization for a UTI and C.diff infection who presented from home with increasing somnolence and improved with empiric broad spectrum antibiotics.
#) Hypotension: The patient's hypotension resolved in the context of fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, and time.
He has not had any localizing symptoms other than perhaps some tachypnea and a subjective sense of dyspnea in concert with increasing perihilar consolidation.
We initially started him on IV Vancomycin and cefepime for presumed cellulitis because of the eryhtema in his legs but that was later judged to be venous insufficincy.
He was noted to have an opacity in his RLL which was read as pneumonia vs atelectasis.
However, at time of discharge, given that he had been on room air for his stay on the floor, and had no other sign of recurrent infection, was transitioned to PO levofloxacin and will complete an 8 day course at rehab.
He was also noted to have some watery diarrhea on and off and therefore was started on PO vancomycin for a total 14 day course for possible recurrence of his c. diff.
#) Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Pt has completed cycle 6 of docetaxel on [**2137-3-4**] and radiation therapy for a spinal met as well.
