On admission to MICU, she was started on Heparin IV, and thrombolytics were not immediately given until her respiratory distress increased.
IVC filter not placed given the respiratory distress and unstable hemodynamics.
Twelve hours after admission to the ICU, she received thrombolytics (Alteplase 100 mg) but dyspnea did not improve and SBP continued to hover in the 90s, which supports the malignant nature of the mass rather than thrombosis.
She received Decadron 10mg Q6H for the likely lymphoma.

She received a morphine drip, titrated to minimize her pain and discomfort.
