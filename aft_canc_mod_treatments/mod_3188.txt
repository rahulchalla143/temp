Of note, he had been on hydrocodone approximately 30 mg daily for significant baseline bony pain.
Saturday, [**12-21**], in the morning, the patient was too weak to walk to the bathroom and his speech was not coherent.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral infiltrates and the patient was started on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.
For sedation, the patient received intravenous haloperidol and lorazepam.
This was changed to morphine sulfate and midazolam; both were held at 10 o'clock a.m. on [**12-22**].
Antibiotics were changed to ticarcillin with beta lactamase inhibitor on [**12-23**].
On [**12-26**], the patient's morphine sulfate IV drip was discontinued and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**].
On arrival, he was again on morphine sulfate IV drip, 5 mg per hour.
Acetaminophen, 500 mg every six hours.
Morphine sulfate, 1 mg per hour.
Metoprolol, 5 mg intravenous every six hours.
Nitro paste, one inch transdermal.
Ventilator settings: Assist control 700/12, FIO2 40%, no spontaneous breathing, no breathing when ventilator temporarily stopped.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, with positive bowel sounds and a pulsating mass in the epigastrium.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient's unresponsiveness was felt to have a differential diagnosis including medication effect from narcotics, cerebrovascular accident, infection, anoxic brain injury, hypernatremia.
Antibiotics were changed to ceftazidime and vancomycin given the possibility of nosocomial pneumonia.
Clinical nutrition assessment recommended tube feeding which was initiated.
On [**12-29**], MRI was obtained, but, unfortunately, did not include diffusion imaging and Neurology consult recommended repeat MR.  On that day, Cardiology consult agreed with diagnosis of non-Q wave myocardial infarction and recommended increasing beta blockade and adding ACE inhibitor.
Heparin anticoagulation was also advised.
On [**12-30**], insulin drip was started for elevated blood glucose.
Antihypertensive management continued, as well as ventilatory support.
Hypernatremia was persistent and dextrose 5% and water continued to be administered.
Hydralazine was added and carefully increased for blood pressure control.
Vancomycin and ceftriaxone continued for copious pulmonary secretions and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray.
Serum ammonia noted to continue to be elevated and lactulose increased.
Electrophysiology Service sub consulted and agreed with continued heparin and, also, suggested calcium repletion.
Suggested consideration of low protein diet for elevated ammonia.
Iron studies were recommended for iron overload and were relatively positive.
While this was not felt to be relevant to acute presentation, hemochromatosis gene studies were recommended in order to advise family for future screening.
On [**1-4**], the patient required two units of packed red blood cells for gradually dropping hematocrit.
Was switched to cutaneous ventilatory ventilation.
His hematocrit continued to gradually decline requiring packed red blood cells.
On [**1-6**], diuresis was initiated.
A family meeting outlined options of aggressive care versus attempt to minimize invasiveness and extubate.
The family agreed to a trial of pain medicines to see if it helped the patient's comfort, rather than favoring continuing to allow the patient to be in pain in long-term failing attempt to improve mental status.
Diuresis was achieved with IV furosemide.
The patient continued to have episodes of tachypnea requiring suctioning and had decreased blood pressure which was felt to be due to excessively rapid diuresis.
Diuresis was continued, but more gently.
Metoprolol was decreased due to bradycardia and hypotension.
On [**1-9**], pressure support ventilation was decreased to [**10-25**].
Aggressive diuresis was continued.
Antibiotics were discontinued, despite low grade methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus in sputum which was felt, at this point, to be colonization.
The family wished the patient's status changed to Do Nor Resuscitate, but was not ready to make a decision about tracheostomy and gastric feeding tube.
The patient failed his decreased pressure support ventilation and eventually required return to continuous mandatory ventilation.
Aggressive diuresis was continued with titration of lactulose and metronidazole.
Pressure support ventilation with higher inspiratory pressures was attempted with improvement.
Ammonia had increased to 82 despite lactulose with four bowel movements per day.
Planning for tracheostomy and gastric tube was initiated.
On [**1-13**], it was possible to decrease pressure support to 5.
On [**1-13**], blood cultures were positive for gram positive cocci in one bottle and vancomycin was given as temperature spiked to 102.1.
Bronchoscopy showed mild secretions and the tracheostomy was placed without complications.
On [**1-14**], minimal pressure support on tracheostomy was all that was required, but the patient continued to be encephalopathic.
Packed red blood cell transfusion was required for gradually falling hematocrit.
Blood cultures grew mixed gram positive cocci felt to be possible contamination and only in one blood culture bottle; vancomycin discontinued.
The patient was unable to tolerate a tracheostomy mask ventilation trial and positive pressure ventilation needed to be resumed.
There was some difficulty with respiration due to internal bleeding around trach site which resolved with epinephrine injections by Interventional Pulmonology fellow.
Further discussions with the family indicated that they were still working towards a decision, but they wanted pain management liberalized, feeling that he was in quite a bit of pain.
Aggressive diuresis was continued, but efforts to intervene on mental status were suspended.
Hypernatremia was resolved without improvement in mental status.
Family was informed and partial autopsy with omission of the head was requested.
