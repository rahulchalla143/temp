CT A/P with contrast showed pelvic fluid collcetion with air and contrast from CT 2 days ago concerning for bowel leak - surgery consulted and do not feel suregery indicated given history of cancer and previous documentation of pelvic fluid collection.
He was started on Vanc/Levo/Flagyl.

Findings consistent with acute tubular necrosis/renal dysfunction with retained IV contrast from exam two days prior.
Admission lactate of 6.5 normalised following fluid resuscitation.
Treated with broad spectrum antibiotics (IV vancomycin and meropenem) given a history of ESBL E. Coli in pelvic abscess and oral metronidazole; 2 week course is planned with final day [**2195-2-6**].
As his rectal cancer was in remission and that IR drainage may provide bridge to surgery, this was pursued.
He had a drain placed into his pelvic collection on [**1-25**].
After discussion with IR, his catheter was cut and removed.
It was difficult to insert and they felt that given the complexity of the case that surgical treatment should first be sought.
Latterly, surgery felt no further surgical intervention was necessary at this time although this may be revisited in the future.
On reviewing his severe metabolic derangements, he was found to have severe hypomagnesemia (0.3) and hypocalcemia (4.8) which were the likely cause of confusion (metabolic encephalopathy), tremors and eye signs.
These were repleted with IV magnesium and calcium aggressively and normalised.
For periodic agitation, haloperidol was used.
Aflutter/AF: On presentation he was noted to be tachycardic in Aflutter with variable block but given concomitant agitation and severe metabolic derangement he was initially treated with IV metoprolol and was fluid resuscitated.
Due to borderline BPs and after intubation on [**1-24**] he was supported with IV pressors.
Given persistent tachycardia to 140s, his norepinephrine was changed to phenylephrine and was treated with IV diltiazem and latterly a diltiazem infusion.
Post-extubation on [**1-28**], his heart rate was still problem[**Name (NI) 115**] and he was converted from a diltiazem IV infusion to oral diltiazem and metoprolol.
Metabolic acidosis: The patient presented with a combined elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis and a non AG metabolic acidosis and of note, he had his metabolic acidosis on previous admissions.
His hyperchloremic acidosis was considered likely from ostomy and NaCl resuscitation.
Acidosis was felt likely multifactorial in the setting of renal failure, increasing urostomy output and sepsis secondary to his chronic pelvic collection.
He was treated with oral bicarbonate and his acid-base status corrected.
Respiratory failure: On presentation, there was the possibility of LLL pneumonia on portable CXR [**1-24**] based on radiology read with possible atelectasis vs consolidation in retrocardiac region.
This was monitored and managed symptomatically with acetaminophen prn for pain and his pain improved.
Per surgery, IR guided drainage of pelvic collection may provide a bridge to operative management and this occurred but when his drain fell out and was latterly removed, it was felt that no further intervention was needed at this time.
[**Name2 (NI) **] was maintained as full code and will need a court-appointed guardian to serve as HCP as his choice of his RN could not be his HCP due to policy.
