After the operation, pt originally did well but then had increasing amounts of bile out of his nasogastric tube and signs of obstruction.
The patient was brought to the operating room for reduction of this obstruction which seems to be at the level of the jejunostomy tube as well as improvement in his pulmonary situation.
There was obstruction of the jejunum proximal to the jejunostomy tube site which seemed to be somewhat kinked over but also probably was somewhat narrowed by the tube.
Post-op, the pt had fevers and was started on vanc and cipro.
The pt was made strict NPO and his tube feeds were continued.
