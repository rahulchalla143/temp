Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated in the Emergency Room by the Trauma service then admitted to the Trauma ICU for close monitoring, frequent neuro checks and pulmonary toilet as well as pain control.
His GCS on admission was 15 however he soon became very agitated and eventually required intubation and sedation to keep him calm.
His chest xray showed a large right pleural effusion and he had a chest tube placed which drained about 1 liter of blood.
He was oxygenating well but did require 2 blood transfusions during his initial resuscitation.
After he was weaned and extubated from the respirator he was able to follow simple commands but unfortunately his episodes of agitation were treated with Ativan and this seemed to cause over sedation.
The geriatric service was consulted to assist in balancing his medications in light of his Parkinson's disease.
They recommended treating him with Seroquel instead on benzo's or Haldol and this over time was effective.
He was fitted for a TLSO brace and required another revisement.
Following extubation from the respirator on [**2189-3-19**] his chest tube was removed and he was kept in the ICU for persistent episodes of agitation and delirium.
He had a speech and swallow evaluation and failed secondary to aspiration therefore a dobhoff feeding tube was placed and remains in place,  Hopefully as his mental status improves the study can be repeated.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was making some progress and his agitation is controlled with increased doses of Seroquel at HS and a low dose in the AM.
His pain is controlled with Oxycodone and Tylenol and he has been able to get out of bed to a chair with Physical Therapy as long as his pain is controlled.
Nutritional recommendations were made today to change his formula to Boost glucose control at 80cc/hr however given the transfer to rehab I elected not to change the preparation prior to transfer.
His foley catheter was removed on [**2189-3-25**] but replaced the same day due to urinary retention.
He was also started on Flomax.
A voiding trial should occur [**2189-3-27**].
