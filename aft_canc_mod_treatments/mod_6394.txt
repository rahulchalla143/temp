Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 79-year-old left handed man with a history of right fronto-temporal anaplastic astrocytoma, atrial fibrillation s/p ablation, DVT/PE on Lovenox, and asbetosis who presents with a 30 minute GTC on Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **].
At the OSH he was loaded with phosphenytoin 2400 mg.
He was found to have pneumonia, and was started on vancomycin 1 gram IV.
He required intubation for airway protection, and his BP dropped to 39/14, requiring levophed.
Repeat CXR on admission showed diffuse prominent interstitial markings but no pneumonia, so the antibiotics were discontinued.
He was initially on Dilantin 100 mg tid, and his Keppra was increased to 1500 [**Hospital1 **].
He was also started on oxcarbazepine, with the goal of titrating off the Dilantin and up on the oxcarbazepine (given that Dilantin can interact with the chemotherapeutic agents).
He was to also remain on the Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
There was concern for an retroperitoneal bleed versus hematoma around lumbar plexus, especially given recent catheterization for atrial fibrillation ablation, as the cause of his hypotension.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3929**] were consulted for field radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy (Temodar).
