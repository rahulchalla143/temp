.. **Patient was noted to become more hypoxic and required increased O2 requirement during the day.
BMT moonlighter was notified of status around 8pm, (VS p 90s SBP 90s O2 low 90s on [**5-10**] L o2) who felt she was wet on exam and she was given 40 IV lasix with some effect in terms of urine outpt, but her respiratory status continued to deteriorate and ABG was hypoxic 7/43/40s/60s, CXR w/ diffuse pulmonary infiltrate.
lasix 80 x 1 was given around 11pm for concern of pulmonary edema and ?frothy pink production.
Intubation was started and she became hypotensive to 60s/30s and acute became asystolic.
She was started on CPR and 1 mg epi was given.
SHe received A-line, 1L fluid bolus, started on propofol for agitation and continued on levophed and her antibiotics was changed to linezolid/zosyn/foscarnet/caspofungin to optimize possible VRE infection.
Her CXR at [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] s/p intubation showed nl heart size and diffuse, somethwat improved opacitiy but no focal infiltrate.
.. She was diagnosed in [**2194-11-3**] after routine CBC.
A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a large mass in the left upper quadrant with numerous enlarged celiac, porta hepatis, splenic and hilar lymph nodes.
A fine needle aspirate of the retroperitoneal lymph node unfortunately was nondiagnostic and she underwent a bone marrow biopsy and retroperitoneal lymph node biopsy which did prove positive for diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
She was treated with 6 cycles of R-CHOP resulting in a CR, followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue in [**2195-4-4**].
She relapsed with disease in her spleen and underwent a splenectomy in [**Month (only) 359**] [**2194**].
She received [**Hospital1 **] with rituximab x 6 cycles, and one cycle of Zevalin.
She received a combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin x1 and then underwent radiation therapy, completed on [**2196-5-6**].
She denies fevers, chills, night sweats, sinsus congestion, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, urinary sx, gyn sx, neurologic changes.
was initially diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in [**2194-11-3**] and was treated with R-CHOP for a total of six cycles, which resulted in complete remission.
This was followed by an autologous bone marrow transplant as consolidation treatment in [**2195-4-4**].
Therefore it was decided that the patient would undergo more chemo with combination of gemcitabine at 1.5 grams per meters squared on day one and eight every three weeks with cisplatin at 50 mg per meters squared on day one and eight.

These findings could be consistent with inflammatory/infectious etiologies, including opportunistic infection.
IMPRESSION: 1.Increased fluid within both mastoid sinuses, could secondary to inflammatory or infectious processes, including an opportunistic infection.
8.Increased iron predominantly in Kupffer cells and focally in hepatocytes on iron stain.

FC COmmunication with husband [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] (H) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13535**], (c) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 13536**] Dispo: ICU for now  #FEN-continue TPN for now   Brief Hospital Course: +61 y/o WF with a PMHx of B cell lymphoma treated with 6 cycles of R-CHOP, followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue in [**2195-4-4**], relapse and splenectomy in [**9-/2195**], [**Hospital1 **] with rituximab x 6 cycles, and one cycle of Zevalin, continued disease and treatment with gemcitabine and cisplatin x1 and then underwent radiation therapy who presents to [**Hospital1 18**] for MUD nonmyeloablative allogenic SCT.
MUD NONMYELOABLATIVE ALLOGENIC SCT:  Pt was not given Bactrim PPX secondary to sulfa allergy.
She was given demerol x2, tylenol, and ativan.
In addition she was given lopressor for rate control.
Fludarabine was started five days and Cytoxan/Mesna four days pre-transplant.
Cyclosporine was started day -1.
MUD nonmyeloblative allogeneic stem cell transplantation was performed on [**2196-5-19**].
Tolerated therapy well.
Two weeks into her post-tx course, Cyclosporine was held due to possible toxicity and altered MS.
Patient was placed on SoluMedrol 20mg IV bid for immunosuppression to prevent graft rejection.
FEVER/NEUTROPENIA:  Pt had no further fever until day +1, at which time she was started on Cefepime in addition to the acyclovir and fluconazole PPX that had been started on day -1.
Vancomycin was started day +2.
Caspofungin was started day +5.
She spike a fever and flagyl was added for possible C.Dif, cultures were negative x2 for C.Dif.
As patient continued into her second week, her counts improved, fevers remitted, and patient was d/ced from Flagyl and vancomycin.
As her [**Date Range 9026**] began rising on [**6-10**], patient was d/ced from Caspofungin due to increased [**Month/Day (4) 9026**].
Pt was loaded with Dilantin and followed clinically over the last 5 days.
We have continued to titrate up her Dilantin per Neuro recs until spikes disappear on routine EEG.
She was started on Foscarnet per ID recs for treatment of HHV-6, although it is unclear whether all of MS changes are due to HHV-6, or ?seizures d/t HHV-6 infection.
+VRE BACTIURIA -Pt was found to have +VRE bactiuria on [**6-17**], her catheter was replaced, and pt was placed on Linezolid 600mg qD.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -Pt was placed on CSA post-tx and developed increasing Creatinine levels, decreased UOP, and worsening pleural effusions.
Pt was placed on a Lasix drip and the CSA was held.
Pt diuresed effectively and was taken off of the Lasix drip.
A Lasix Drip for diuresis was started with good urine output.
FEN:  Patient was started on TPN [**5-19**].
HYPOTHYROID: continued synthroid 100 mcg QD, and switched to Synthroid 50mg IV qD when not tolerating PO meds.
MIGRAINE:  discontinued verapamil 120 mg QD, no symptoms throughout hospitalization.
Pt was transported to ICU and her care continued there.
Initially pt was kept on caspofungin and foscarnet and other abx were changed to zosyn and linezolid to ensure broad coverage as etiology of her worsening medical condition was not known.
She also required transient pressure support with neosynephrine when initially transferred but was subsequently weaned off.
During ICU stay, pt was evaluated and consulted by ID, who recommended changing Imipenem to daptomycin for less Bone marrow suppression, so that was performed.
Neurology was also seeing pt as she had been in ?status during stay on bone marrow transplant wards.
During this time, dilantin dose was adjusted and bedside EEG monitoring was performed which demonstrated decreased amplitude, decreased spike activity.
On her 3rd day in the ICU, pt became increasingly acidemic and hypotensive, requiring pt to be placed back on neosynephrine pressure support.
At approximately 8:40pm on [**7-1**] pt's heart stopped after BP dropping and HR dropping over previous hours.
