As part of the procedure the patient underwent an ileocecectomy and a left [**Doctor Last Name 11455**] hernia repair.
The patient came from the Operating Room with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain routed to the left scrotum and a second [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain to the right pelvis.
The patient was placed on Cefazolin and Flagyl, both of which were continued throughout the patient's stay on the Purple Surgery Service.
He was placed on Metoprolol and the dose was gradually increased for rate control.
Because of the patient's pain, the patient was changed to an intravenous PCA machine.
They recommended oral anti-coagulation when consistent with surgery and rate control.
They suggested an increase in beta blockers and a TSH level and Coumadin with a goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0 when safe.
The patient's TSH came back at 6.1 and the patient was therefore started on oral Levothyroxine.
The patient also had a three plus mitral regurgitation, a four plus tricuspid regurgitation and probably mild aortic stenosis.
His intravenous was Hep-locked and he continued to require repletion for low potassium.
He tolerated his liquid diet the previous day very well and therefore he was advanced to a full diet which he again tolerated well.
