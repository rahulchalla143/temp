She started on Pazopanib in [**2201-4-7**] and this has been complicated labile blood pressures, ranging from 100s to 200 systolic, requiring increasing anti-hypertensive medications.
She takes lasix as needed for lower extremity edema, typically two to three times per week.
The medicine consult service was requested regarding her new post-op atrial fibrillation, and had recommended that she stop her home metroplol, lisinopril, and diltizaem secondary to low blood presures.
On the floor, upon awaking from a nap, she was noted to have Afib with RVR, which she was not in previously; she said she was in [**6-16**] pain in her LLE, but denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, she endorsed a headache, but was without any breathing difficulties.
She was AAOx3, and was given lopressor 5 mg x 3 between 2 PM and 3 PM, and then between 3 and 4 PM was given a total of 25 mg of IV Diltiazem, without any improvement in her atrial fibrillation, with continued rates in the 130s.
She was given 100 mg PO Metoprolol around 1 PM, and was noted at one point after an IV Dilt bolus to have her pressures down to the 88s systolic.
She was then transfered to the ICU for rate control and further monitoring.
The etiology of her Afib was felt to be secondary to a combination of hypovolemia, pain and the discontinuation of her metoprolol and dilt.
She was started on amiodarone (bolus followed by drip) and converted to normal sinus rhythm.
Her blood pressures responded to IV fluids.
She was transitioned to po amiodarone and transferred back to the floor.
