Initially broadened antibiotics to vanc/levo/cefepime to cover above sources.
Initial central venous O2 saturation was 91%.
Patient was transferred from floor to ICU on dopamine and neo; dopamine was converted to levophed.
Shock was refractory to fluid boluses; received normal saline and water with bicarb given renal failure.
The right subclavian triple lumen was removed and a right internal jugular triple lumen was placed.
Goals of care were discussed with family, who requested continued aggressive treatment.
Linezolid replaced vancomycin for VRE bacteremia.
The patient's pressures stabilized and pressors were discontinued.
Also added Meropenem on [**3-24**] given MS decline and asterixis.
There was initially some concern for messenteric ischemia given guiaic positive stool, known necrotic fingers and subsequent CT abd findings, so GI and surgery were consulted.
Patient however soon improved clinically so further work-up with colonoscopy was not done.
A PICC had been placed for access and for ability to start TPN if needed, however TPN was never started.
Patient is also FOB+ s/p 2U PRBC since [**3-17**].
