Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

Most recently, he had an omental graft which was harvested from the intra-abdominal cavity, brought out through a flank wound and into an open wound of the back.
PREPARATION:  In the operating room, the patient was given general endotracheal anesthetic.
Intravenous antibiotics were given.
Catheter was placed into the bladder.
The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position, prepared with Betadine solution and draped in the usual fashion.
We took care to stay in a relatively extraperitoneal plane here and there was certainly adequate amount of coverage of the bowel and its contents with peritoneum such that we could use normal graft material.
Therefore, the graft was divided with clamps and ties of 2-0 Vicryl.
The defect was then measured and we placed a Marlex patch as an underlay with a lot of underlay, measuring at least 3 to 5 cm underneath the fascial edges.
The repair was done under some tension in order to have the edges come together nicely which, indeed, they did.
Dermal sutures of 3-0 Vicryl were then placed and a running subcuticular suture of 4-0 Monocryl was then placed to close the skin.
A dry sterile dressing was then applied.
The patient was then extubated and sent to the recovery area in satisfactory condition, having tolerated the procedure well.
