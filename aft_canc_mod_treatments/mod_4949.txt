Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 7363**] is an 84F with CAD s/p PCI, PAF on coumadin, SSS s/p PPM admitted with [**Last Name (un) **], hyperkalemia, hypotension.
Hypotension: Pt was admitted with SBP in 80s - likely [**3-2**] to hypovolemia and also persistent effects of anti-hypertensive medications that she had taken prior to admission.
She was given IVF and her anti-hypertensives (lisinopril, lasix, aldactone, diltiazem) were held.
Consider restarting antihypertensives as tolerated although not done here as normotensive off  all meds.
Consider restarting lisinopril as Cr and K continue to trend down and as BP tolerates.
Potassium likely high in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **] with use of KCl supplements, Lisinopril, Aldatone, and Bactrim.
She will have a CT head with and without contrast and CTA head done at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] on [**2106-11-25**] at 1pm at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] and will see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in Neurosurgery for follow-up on [**2106-12-2**] at 2pm on the [**Location (un) **] of the [**Hospital **] Medical Building at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**].
Received Vitamin K 10mg IV at the OSH for reversal, given concern for possible head bleed.
Coumadin was initially held while hospitalized while supratherapeutic but restarted at home dose 2.5mg on [**2106-11-18**].
Goal INR [**3-3**] and was 1.2 on discharge; will need INR monitoring (INR to be checked [**2106-11-22**] and thereafter prn) and Coumadin adjustment as needed.
Type 2 DM uncontrolled with complications: Glyburide was held given elevated Cr while inpatient.
Would continue on insulin sliding scale alone for now.
