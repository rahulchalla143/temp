Previously he had been discharged to rehab on n lisinopril and lasix, and his creatinine worsened since that time.
Renal failure was likely multifactorial related to his poor cardiac function, prerenal azotemia leading to ATN, and complicated by ACE inbitor and lasix use, obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy as he was noted to have urine residuals of 350cc when catheter was inserted, and continued periods of hypotension.
Hemodialysis was discussed at length with the patient by both the primary medical and renal teams.
He developed subtle metabolic acidosis, K+ rose but not above the normal level, and he continued to make urine and maintain a euvolemic fluid balance.
He was treated with a two week course of fluconazole 200mg daily.
Infectious disease service was consulted and saw no indication for amphotericin bladder washes.
Conjestive heart failure:  With treatment for his renal failure the patient developed acute worsening of his conjestive heart failure.
There a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed for tailored diuresis.
He was diuresed and placed on afterload reduction with hydralazine.
The metoprolol dose was reduced, the hydralazine initially held, then restarted at a reduced dose, and lasix discontinued.
CXR here showed a possible pneumonia, and he was treated with levofloxacin.
Additionally he was treated with flagyl for c.diff infection.
He was continued on anticoagulation.
INR became surpratherapeutic while on concurrent antibiotics, and coumadin was held.
It remained elevated, thought to be due to nutritional Vit K deficiency, but eventually trended down.
He should be treated for an additional 3months.
Coumadin should be resumed at 2mg qHS, and held for INR >2 (goal INR [**1-24**]).
He should likely consider repeat colonoscopy as part of his outpatient.
He was treated with Epogen injections, and Hct remained stable.
The patient was initially treated with a regular insulin sliding scale.
He was discharged to rehab on 26units Lantus in the mornings, and a regular insulin sliding scale.
His renal failure may progress, and he may require hemodialysis at some time in the future.
