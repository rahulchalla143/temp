Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 10940**] is an 80y/o gentleman with Afib, HTN, MDS and new left pleural effusion who underwent an outpatient thoracentesis complicated by apical PTX requiring MICU admission for 100% NRB to help reabsorption.
Interventional Pulmonology felt no chest tube was needed.
He was admitted to the MICU for non-rebreather treatment overnight.
Patient is not on Warfarin or beta blocker at home.
It was felt that his tachycardia could be contributing to an element of diastolic HF so he was started on Metoprolol with resulting rate ~100.
