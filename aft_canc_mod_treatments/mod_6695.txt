She presents for matched unrelated donor allogeneic stem cell transplantation with cytoxan and total body irradiation conditioning.
She was given Dacogen for 10 days.
Continued on cipro and flagyl given her previous S. viridans bacteremia and C. diff.
Had an episode of emesis following line insertion today, but is otherwise doing well.
Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Presented initially with several weeks of bone pain.
She was diagnosed with acute monocytic leukemia, M5, and had complex cytogenetics.
She underwent remission induction therapy with 7+3 (daunorubicin 90mg/m2 days [**12-1**] and cytarabine 100 mg/m2 days [**12-5**]).
Her counts recovered with blasts and she had several indeterminate bone marrow examinations.
Her cytogenetics on serial bone marrows did normalize after her complex cytogenetics on her initial specimen.
She received post-remission therapy with high dose cytarabine from [**Date range (3) 78038**].
She began re-induction therapy with clofarabine/cytarabine on [**2111-6-16**] .
Past surgical history Casearian section Gastric bypass [**2107**] [**Last Name (un) 8509**]  Social History: Married with 2 children, age 13 and 15.
Right and left lines placed without hematoma.
[**9-7**] CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS: CHEST: Left internal jugular line terminates in the distal SVC, and a right large-bore catheter extends from the internal jugular vein into the deep right atrium.
Foley catheter is present in a partially collapsed bladder.
Volume overload with pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, ascites, and anasarca.
Dialysis catheter extends to the region of the right atrium and the left subclavian catheter extends to the region of the cavoatrial junction.
Opacification in the retrocardiac region persists, consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
She was conditioned with total body radiation and cytarabine.
She received the transplant on the floor, but a few days later she had worsening liver and renal function with rising bilirubin, INR, and creatinine.
Following initial fluid resuscitation, her SBP increased transiently to the 120s and she became responsive.
Upon arrival to the ICU, crystalloid and colloid fluid resuscitation and pressors were continued.
Her antibiotic coverage was broaded and her BP improved to the point where she was no longer pressor dependent.
Bone marrow transplant service was notified and her steroids were increased to try to treat a possible engraftment syndrome/cytokine storm.
Also, vancomycin was added for additional gram positive coverage.
Because of this, she was treated empirically for possible [**Last Name (un) **]-occulsive disease with defibrotide.
She developed profound acidosis and was again required vasopressors for blood pressure support.
Despite maximum medical support, tgh resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful and the patient expired.
