A 10 mm by 4 cm coated metal wall stent was placed successfully.
Cold forceps biopsies were perfomred for histology from the mass.
The patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from pancreatic surgery who felt that the mass could be a benign adenoma or an adenocarcinoma.
Depending on the nature of the mass, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt that surgery may be indicated.

This would necesitate a prior ERCP with removal of the metal stent and placement of a plastic stent.
