In the pm of day 1, he was given his first dose of vincristine 2mg IV x1.
The medications were separated in time because he was considered high risk for TLS because his LDH was 1100 and rising and he had Burkitts with a large tumor burden.
On day 3, he received IT cytarabine + hydrocortisone with no complications and 400 mg IV cytoxan with no complications.
On day 5, he received the second dose of IT cytarabine with hydrocortisone with no complications.

On day 14, he had coffee ground emesis overnight and guaic + stools so he was started on IV PPI.
In the setting of such a high wbc, there was concern for Cdiff Toxin B even though Cdiff A was negative x >3 so stool was sent for toxin B and the patient was started on po vanco in addition to flagyl.
