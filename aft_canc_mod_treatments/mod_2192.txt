There are bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes at the T11/12 level.
Again seen is posterior instrumented fusion with a left-sided pedicle screw at T5, bilateral pedicle screws at T6, T8, T9, T10, L1 and L2.
The T11 and T12 vertebral bodies show areas of destruction/surgical resection with a bone graft material within the vertebrectomy defect.
IMPRESSION: Status post surgical resection of large T11 mass, now with postoperative air-fluid level in this region.
