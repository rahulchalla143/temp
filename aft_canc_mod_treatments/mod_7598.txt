She had been in USOH after discharge on [**3-1**] from recent admission for pneumonia at [**Hospital **] hospital, where she had been treated with antibiotics and steroids.
Of note, she was recently admitted to [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital from [**2-24**] for pneumonia, and was discharged on antibiotics (completed course on [**3-5**]) and prednisone (last dose of 30 mg taken on [**3-7**]).
Troponin was negative.
She was also given ceftriaxone and azithromycin for possible infiltrate (vs. resolving PNA) on CXR.
While on the floor this morning, the team noted that she was hypotensive to 90s/60s and she was started on vancomycin and cefepime for coverage of possible HCAP.
She was bolused 1L on the floor without improvement of her blood pressures and was transferred to the ICU for further management.
Past Medical History: -CAD s/p MI and stent placement x2 in [**2164**] (First stent [**2164-8-30**], 2nd [**2164-10-10**]) -Htn -HL -atrial fibrillation (never on warfarin, [**2-20**] past GI bleed) -hx of hemolytic anemia in [**2165**] (confirmed by PCP), Rx'd rituximab (not confirmed by PCP patient does not remember) -iron deficiency anemia -s/p appendectomy -s/p hysterectomy -s/p L shoulder arthroscopy [**2166**] -s/p tonsillectomy  Social History: Lives at home with children/grandchildren.
PATHOLOGY: [**2171-3-8**] CXR: Right middle lobe opacity may represent atelectasis or pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: Moderate LVH, small, hyperdynamic left ventricle with consequent development of an LVOT gradient as the mitral valve, chordae and papillary muscle contact the interventricular septum during systole.
She developed hypotension and respiratory distress in the setting of Afib with RVR, and was tranferred to the ICU for further management.
After a family discussion regarding goals of care the patient was made comfort measures only and extubated on the [**2-22**] and passed the following night.
Goals of Care: After discussion with patient's family, decision was made to change patient's status to comfort measures only, as her family did not feel she would have wanted continued aggressive treatment without making improvement.
The patient was extubated on the night of [**2171-3-22**], and started on a morphine gtt titrated to comfort.
All other medications were stopped.
She was made comfortable with a morphine gtt, scopolamine patch, lorazepam and sublingual levsin.
On [**3-17**] she was febrile to 103 and antibiotics were broadened from cefepime to vanc/zosyn/cipro.
She required pressor support.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was asked to evaluate for possibility of percutaneous valvuloplasty.
However, subsequent TEE demonstrated that patient's cardiac dysfunction was secondary to significant LVOT obstruction, and that her aortic valve was not significantly stenosed.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Patient was initially anticoagulated with aspirin only, due to history of upper GIB.
The patient's home atenolol was switched to metoprolol which was uptitrated.
She continued to have RVR and was started on an amiodarone gtt and heparin gtt.
The amiodarone was eventually switched to PO and the heparin gtt was stopped due to coffee grounds from NG tube.
She was started on allopurinoal and IVF due to elevated uric acid and risk of tumor lysis.
Protonix drip was started.
She required intermittent RBC transfusions.
