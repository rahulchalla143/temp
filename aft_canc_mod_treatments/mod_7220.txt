She was maintained on lasix for her CHF.
In the unit she was originally treated with vanco/levo/flagyl (patient has a pcn allergy) but she continued to spike fevers.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt this would be very unusual for this drug, but still considered it a possibility, especially in view of LFT abnormalities (below) suggestive of possible drug-induced cholestasis (again unusual for carboplatin).
After excluding more likely causes, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] considered the possibility that carboplatin might explain the fevers and transaminitis/cholestasis in view of the time course, although acknowledged that this would be unusual for this medication.
Her statin was held, and the recommendation was made to the patient that this medication not be restarted.
Patient's transaminases and bilirubin plateaued and were trending downwards on discharge, with the patient feeling well (total bilirubin plateaued in the low 6 range, mostly direct in nature).
