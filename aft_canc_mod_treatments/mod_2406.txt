PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery bypass graft x2 approximately one year prior to admission.
Lisinopril 2.
Metoprolol 3.
Aspirin  ALLERGIES:  He had no known allergies to medications.
The exam was severely limited due to fairly poor patient cooperation and compliance with instructions.
LABORATORY DATE AT THE TIME OF INITIAL ASSESSMENT AT [**Hospital6 **] ON [**1-17**]:  Essentially within normal limits and he was seen at the [**Hospital6 2561**] in consultation by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 6910**] who made arrangements for the patient to be transferred and admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital for a craniotomy on the [**1-20**].
Due to these findings and the history of decreased memory, the patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital on the morning of [**2136-1-20**] at which time he was taken to the operating room where, under a general endotracheal anesthetic, the patient underwent a craniotomy and subtotal excision of the enhancing lesion.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, went to the post anesthesia care unit in stable condition and was subsequently transferred to the floor the morning following surgery and did quite well on the floor for the first several days.
A repeat head CT scan on the [**1-24**] showed a small amount of blood products in the area of the tumor bed and cavity of the tumor with some mild residual ring enhancement.
He was placed supine and quickly became more responsive with the oxygen saturation returning to 98% to 99%.
On the 14th, he was seen in consultation by neuro-oncology and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] who recommended external beam radiotherapy.
His lungs were clear, however a CTA of the chest was obtained which did reveal a saddle embolus and therefore the interventional radiology department was consulted and this lead to a thrombectomy and IVC filter.
The patient tolerated this procedure quite well, was returned to the floor that evening in stable condition.
He was seen in consultation in the x-ray therapy department on the [**1-31**] for evaluation and initial planning and measurements for planned external beam radiotherapy to be begun in an outpatient manner.
However, on the [**2-6**], due to bouts of respiratory failure, the patient was intubated urgently and readmitted to the neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit in acute respiratory distress and after discussion with the family, the patient was then heparinized for prophylactic treatment to avoid further risk of deep venous thrombosis or embolus.
He did quite well, was weaned from the intubation within 48 hours and was transferred to the floor on the [**2135-2-9**].
He was maintained on heparin until the [**1-16**] with Lovenox started on the [**1-15**] to overlap for one day and did well throughout the remainder of his hospitalization.
The patient had been given a PEG tube for tube feedings and nutritional support prior to discharge and on the morning of the [**1-16**], he was noted to be awake, alert, afebrile with vital signs stable.
He responded with dysarthric speech and again was noted to speak only Italian, so level of appropriateness was difficult to obtain without the presence of an interpreter.
The telemetry was discontinued on the 4th and the patient was subsequently to be discharged to the [**Hospital3 7**] Rehabilitation Center on the morning of the [**2136-2-14**] with plans for follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6910**] in the clinic in approximately three to four weeks time and instructions for the patient and/or family to call Dr.[**Name (NI) 38469**] office for scheduling of this and also plans were made for the patient to begin his x-ray therapy as an outpatient at the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital with plans for the patient and family or rehabilitation staff to call and confirm the start date for the outpatient x-ray therapy.
Glioblastoma multiforme of brain 2.
Status post saddle emboli, status post embolectomy and inferior vena cava filter placement.
Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous q 12 hours 2.
Oxacillin 1 gm intravenous q 12 hours x10 days total which was begun on the [**2136-2-9**].
He was also to take aspirin 81 mg po or per PEG tube qd.
Lopressor 50 mg per PEG tube or po bid, but hold Lopressor if systolic blood pressure less than 110 or heart rate less than 60.
Reglan 10 mg po or PEG tube tid 6.
Dilantin 200 mg po or PEG tube [**Hospital1 **] 7.
Zantac 150 mg po or PEG tube [**Hospital1 **] 8.
Colace 150 mg po or PEG [**Hospital1 **] 9.
He was also discharged on tube feedings to include ProMod with 5 or 75 cc per hour per the PEG tube  Treatment frequencies at the rehabilitation center were to consist of aggressive physical therapy and occupational therapy, as well as outpatient x-ray therapy to be done at the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital.
Anticipated goals were return to full activities of daily living and rehabilitation potential was considered good at the time of discharge.
