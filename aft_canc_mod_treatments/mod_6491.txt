Admission Date:  [**2154-9-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-9-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-3-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: Altered Mental Status   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**9-13**] left inguinal lymph node biopsy [**9-20**] left thoracentesis [**9-21**] right thoracentesis   History of Present Illness:  44F transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with AMS x1 month and general malaise.
In [**Month (only) 205**], she developed L hip pain which was initially treated with PT and improved.
She was started on narcotics and Valium.
These meds were stopped but she continued to have AMS and weakness.
Non-bloody, non-bilious.
Foley was placed, she was given Lasix, 4L NS and started empirically on heparin gtt given persistent tachycardia, possible malignancy, and inability to obtain CTA.
She was also given Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone at OSH given concern for PNA vs LLL mass on CXR.
She was initially continued on heparin gtt then stopped and given Tylenol suppository.
?F) HR: 104 (104 - 108) bpm BP: 111/63(74) {92/47(58) - 111/65(74)} mmHg RR: 20 (16 - 30) insp/min SpO2: 98% Heart rhythm: ST (Sinus Tachycardia General: Appears older than stated age, intermittently dysarthric, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: PERRL, Sclera anicteric, MM very dry, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, b/l supraclavicular LAD, 3cm Lungs: Diminished BS at L base and dullness to percussion, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rhythm, fast, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, Palpable LLQ mass extending almost to midline GU: foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: Oriented to person, place, time, POTUS.
Within the limitations of a non-contrast study, no evidence of epidural abscess or intraspinal mass seen.
MRI would be more sensitive for detecting intracranial malignancy, if clinically warranted.
PATHOLOGY: FISH evaluation for a BCL6 rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the LSI BCL6 Dual Color, Break Apart Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) at 3q27 and is interpreted as ABNORMAL.
A normal MYC FISH finding can result from absence of a MYC rearrangement, from an atypical MYC rearrangement, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
FISH evaluation for an IGH-BCL2 rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the Vysis LSI IGH/BCL2 Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for IGH at 14q32 and BCL2 at 18q21 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
A normal finding can result from absence of an IGH-BCL2 rearrangement, from a variant IGH-BCL2 rearrangement, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
# Large cell lymphoma: She was suspected to have lymphoma based upon clinical presentation and she underwent a left inguinal lymph node dissection which confirmed large cell lymphoma.
# Bilateral pleural effusions: Upon admission, patient had a 4L supplemental O2 requirement.
After three days of aggressive diuresis (net negative 6-7L) she was able to maintain her saturations at >95% on room air.
She underwent thoracenteses of each side separately, with removal of 1L each.
# AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT): Patient with intermittent episodes of narrow complex, regular tachycardia to 200s which self-resolve in less than 1 minute.
Calcium improved with IVF, intermittent IV lasix, and calcitonin.
She was treated with 7 days of ceftriaxone and 5 days of azithromycin, although her CT chest showed clear lung parenchyma with large bilateral effusions.
Later in the hospitalization, on day 1 of filgrastim administration after [**Hospital1 **], she spiked a fever to 100.4 2 hours after filgrastim.
This resolved without treatment and blood cultures were negative.
# Acute kidney insufficiency: This was multifactorial including contributions from tumor lysis syndrome, hypercalcemia, hypovolemia, and lymphadenopathy causing obstruction.
Also, she had left lower extremity swelling (doppler negative) after her inguinal lymph node dissection.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Please make sure that she stays on schedule for her chemotherapy cycles in the future.
She will come to 7F for rituximab on Thursday and then she should be admitted for further cycles of dose-adjusted [**Hospital1 **] due to pleural involvement of lymphoma - Please set-up for her to have a port placed before her next cycle of [**Hospital1 **], this can be done when she returns on Thursday for rituximab - Please assess the need for ongoing DVT/PE prophylaxis with lovenox due to hypercoagulability of cancer  Medications on Admission: [**Doctor First Name **] PRN Flonase PRN Colace PRN Ibuprofen 800mg TID PRN (never more)   Discharge Medications: 1. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
