Was treated initially with Protonix and, five days prior to presentation there, complained of shortness of breath and decreased breath sounds on the right.
She underwent thoracentesis in the Emergency Room there, with 1300 cc of an exudative fluid aspirated.
At this time, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**], where her pleural effusions were tapped, and she had a drain placed in her pericardium.
We consulted Surgery for biopsy, which revealed poorly-differentiated cells, consistent with some adenocarcinomatous process.
The patient and her husband were aware of the implications, and wished not to have aggressive measures taken on her behalf.
However, with regard to symptomatic relief, we note that the patient's shortness of breath had progressed during the hospitalization, and she underwent rigid bronchoscopy with stenting of the bronchi for symptomatic relief.
Two days prior to her demise, she was made comfort measures, and a morphine drip was started, titrated for her comfort.
