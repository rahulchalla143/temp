Pathology revealed nodular-type melanoma, invasive to a depth of at least 4.6 mm, [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level at least 4, extending to the deep and lateral resection margins with ulceration present at 8 mm.
On [**2195-11-23**], she underwent pulmonary wedge resection of a metastatic nodule.
On [**1-4**], she started on daily Temodar but after 6 weeks of therapy she was found to have widely progressive disease.
The team elected to discontinue infusion because of hypoxia and acute renal failure.
Limited exam due to lack of IV contrast.
Nodal lesion 6 measures approximately 48 x 32 mm (previously 45 x 35 mm).
Adjacent target lesions 2 and 3 cannot be adequately measured on this non- contrast study but may have also slightly increased in size compared to [**2197-4-6**].
Endotraheal tube terminates approximately 5cm above the carina.
Right central venous catheter terminates near the cavoatrial junction.
The pancreas and right adrenal gland appear unremarkable.
A left external iliac lymph node measures 1.8 cm in short axis diameter compared to [**Month (only) 958**] when it measured 15 mm.
Limited non-contrast evaluation demonstrates progression of metastatic disease with increased pulmonary tumor burden and increase in size of multiple lymph node groups as described.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 3866**] is a 39 year old woman with malignant melanoma who received Interleukin-2 and developed hypotension, hypoxia and fevers requiring transfer to the ICU where she was intubated and placed on pressor agents.
The patient developed oliguric renal failure, renal was consulted, but she did not require dialysis and her kidney function returned to baseline.
She had persistently high ventilatory requirements and was difficult to wean from the ventilator, despite treatment for pneumonia.
She was made comfort measures only and was terminally extubated on [**2197-6-2**].
