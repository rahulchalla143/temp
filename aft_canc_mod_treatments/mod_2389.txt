FINDINGS: Since the prior chest CT of [**2161-9-30**], a left hemothorax with loculated pneumothorax component has improved, with resolution of blood contents and air contents.
A residual small, dependent left pleural effusion remains, with simple fluid-attenuation characteristics.
There is likely bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy present, difficult to measure in the absence of intravenous contrast.
Followup CT scan in 4 weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy may be helpful to document resolution of the pneumonia and to revaluate the lingular bronchus.
If interval chest radiographs fail to demonstrate clearance of the consolidation, bronchoscopy may be considered.

You were admitted for an infection, that required IV antibiotics in the ICU.
This is a relatively common infection in hospitalized patients, and it should improve quickly with the antibiotic flagyl.

You should finish a 7 day total course of levofloxacin, and a 14 day total course of flagyl.
