The region of swelling has appeared irritated and hard to Mr. [**Known lastname 25267**] at times; he has used Vitamin E lotion, which sometimes helps.
Of note, Mr. [**Known lastname 25267**] had a surgery on his R groin approximately 20 years ago at the [**Location (un) **] Hospital.
He had what sounds like a vascular graft bypass repair to restore blood flow to the penis, followed by resolution of his dysfunction.
Past Medical History: - DM II - Obesity - HTN - CHF - on CPAP for OSA - Chronic leg ulcers - Torn cartilage in R knee  PSH: - splenectomy s/p MVA in late teens - Bypass surgery for R testicle, as noted above (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 25268**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**Location (un) **] Hospital)  Social History: Lives in [**Hospital1 8**] with wife and two children.
Four brothers and two children, all in good health.
GENITAL: bilateral scrotal swelling, R > L.  Per patient, the swelling has decreased since diuresis last night.
The patient was diuresed aggressively, with resolution of the scrotal swelling, and treated with oxacillin for a presumed cellulitis.
Other factors likely contributing to the scrotal edema could include the patient's habitus, compressing the IVC; and a history of R vascular insufficiency due to an old injury, addressed through a bypass procedure 20 years ago -- which might explain why the patient's scrotal edema is R > L.  The patient was fluid restricted and ran approximately 1-1.5 L negative each day.
He was attempted on CPAP/biPAP at night, but often ripped the mask off his face.
A parital study to assess for biPAP goals was conducted on the evening of [**2127-10-9**], and results are commented on in the MICU discharge addendum.
He was treated with oxacillin.
He will complete a 10 day course of oxacillin --> diclox as an outpatient.
He is on a home regimen of Seroquel 200 mg PO TID for unclear reasons.
Ischemia: the patient's EKG was somewhat low-amplitude but not suggestive of ischemia.
The patient was on Lipitor for prophylaxis.
His elevated bicarbs were thought partly metabolic compensation for a chronic respiratory acidosis, and partly due to aggressive diuresis.
There may have been a contribution from hypochloridemia secondary to aggressive diuresis as well.
He is potentially interested in a gastric bypass procedure.
DM: the patient's sugars were controlled with Glipizide 10 mg PO BID and sliding scale insulin with Lantus and Humolog throughout his stay.
