Progressed appearance of inflammation with increased ascites.
No conclusive evidence for perforation but given the inflammatory changes around the duodenum, the appropriate clinical setting, could consider a repeat scan in [**1-30**] hours to evaluate for extravasation and perforation.
Persistent [**Hospital1 **]-basilar, left greater than right, pulmonary consolidations.
There is right IJ line with tip in the SVC.
Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on date of exam at 9:40 a.m.
Labs On Discharge: [**Month/Day/Year 34887**]:  WBC 4.9 HBG 9.6* HCT 27.7* Platelets 377 COAGS:  PT 14.6* PTT  28.3 INR 1.3* Chem 7:  Gluc 91 BUN 16 Crn 0.8 NA 138 K 3.8 CL 101 HCO3 25  Brief Hospital Course: In brief, Mr. [**Known lastname 78266**] is a 49-year-old male with a history of APML s/p multiple rounds of chemotherapy who recently underwent MIDAM chemotherapy, being treated with ATRA and was admitted with febrile neutropenia and diarrhea and found to have GNR sepsis and duodenitis.
# Febrile Neutropenia, GNR sepsis: The patient was initially covered empirically with vancomycin, aztreonam, and flagyl with concern for a GI source given his recent diarrhea and history of anal fissures.
Initial CT scan on [**6-21**] was concerning for duodenitis and the patient's antibiotic regimen was broadened to include ciprofloxacin and micafungin and [**5-2**] blood cultures from the previous day were positive for gram negative rods.
The patient was transfused with multiple units of platelets and also received PRBCs, FFP, and vitamin K to try to correct his coagulopathy.
He was placed on pantoprazole IV BID for GI bleeding.
A repeat CT scan in the evening with gastrograffin demonstrated increased inflammation, but negative for duodenal perforation.
Surgery followed him and thought that there was no indication for surgical management.
He was eventually intubated for airway protection.
Filgrastim was also started for neutropenia.
Patient was treated for a total of two weeks of Vancomycin and Meropenum following recovery of his counts on [**2201-7-2**], consequently last day of therapy was [**2201-7-16**].
Patient continued to have low grade fevers while on Meropenum and Vancomycin.
#  LUE DVT:  During the workup for the patient's fever on meropenem and vancomycin, the patient was found to have DVT in the left upper extremity at the site of a PICC.
Patient was started on heparin drip and was initially started on coumadin, but changed to lovenox.
Lovenox was discontinued.
The decision was made not to restart lovenox as the DVT was likely induced by the PICC placement and small enough not to require long term anticoagulation.
The patient was instructed to discuss restarting this medication with his primary oncologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on discharge.
# Subarachnoid Hemorrhage:  In the setting of anticoagulation with Lovenox.
The patient was given protamine and vitamin K. Head CT showed small subarachnoid hemorrhage and Neurosurgery was consulted.
Started following discontinuation of foley catheter.
Used lidojet and pyridium for symptomatic relief.
