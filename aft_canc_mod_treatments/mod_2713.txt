He was hypotensive on propofol and required 100% FiO2 for 7.39/32/64.
Pt was initially on levo/flagyl for possible aspiration.
He continued to have fevers while he was neutropenic so he was changed to caspo, cefepime, flagyl and vanco.
His counts dropped on vanco so the vanco was d/c'd and his wbc returned to [**Location 213**].
He was then changed to linezolid for gram pos coverage and he became pancytopenic.

These were changed to Cefepime when first neutropenic after chemo, however changed to Caspo, Cefepine, Daptomycin, and Flagyl given neutropenia and persistent fevers.
He was evaluated for passey-muir valve, but due to excessive secretions, we were unable to implement it effectively.
Repeat Head CT revealed increasing mass however no evidence of CNS disease, with a question of impingment on neural foramina and vertebral arteries.
