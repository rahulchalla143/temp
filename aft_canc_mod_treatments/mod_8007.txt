He was put on empiric ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and metronidazole to cover both community-acquired and aspiration bacterial pathogens and has symptomatically improved.
[**First Name (STitle) **], further evaluation was deferred for now; he was kept on a diet of ground solids and thin liquids.
Prior to discharge, his antibiotic regimen was simplified to levofloxacin and metronidazole to complete a 10-day course.
In the setting of this NSTEMI and also due to clinical volume overload, he was diuresed with a series of Lasix boluses.
The MICU team chose to start him on Plavix to help maximize his medical management.
They also reviewed his cardiac cath report from [**1-/2148**] and recommended that he have a P-MIBI due to this new, large drop in his LVEF.
Per cardiology, even if he had a large reversible defect on his MIBI, his [**1-/2148**] cath report showed few (if any) options for potential further revascularization.
He was on home warfarin given his recent diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
His warfarin was initially held but, as his INR came down, he was restarted on a reduced dose (1mg) of warfarin.
On the day prior to discharge, his INR dropped to 1.8, which is below therapeutic level; he was bridged with treatment-dose enoxaparin on that day and his INR was 2.0 by the next day.
Following aggressive hydration in the ED, however, his creatinine quickly returned to baseline.

For your heart attack, you and your PCP have decided to maximize your medical management rather than pursue a stress test and possible invasiuve catheterization since it is unlikely that a catheterization would be of much benefit.
You were seen by the cardiology service while you were here who recommended starting you on two new medications (lisinopril and Plavix) which we will give you prescriptions for.
We also decreased the dose of your Coumadin to only 1mg.
Please take all medications as prescribed.
