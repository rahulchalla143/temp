The patient had a colectomy in [**2200-5-23**], for a splenic flexure carcinoma.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient admitted with the diagnosis of colon carcinoma, for sigmoid colectomy following a prior resection.
On the date of admission, he underwent a sigmoid colectomy.
He had increasing doses of Lopressor as well as Clonidine and Ativan in addition to some anxiolytics.
The patient was then transferred to Surgical Intensive Care Unit where he had respiratory distress and was given intravenous resuscitation.
He required intubation and a Foley catheter was placed with some trauma.
He was begun on vasopressors due to decompensation of his hemodynamics.
He underwent an exploration of the right lower extremity and right femoral embolectomy and fasciotomy to the lower leg due to a poor blood flow.
He then developed increasing oliguria with a rising BUN and creatinine associated with a very elevated CPK of 28,000, which improved after his fasciotomies.
He was continued on antibiotics.
A Quinton catheter was placed and the patient was dialyzed after some period of a bit more stability.
He was thought perhaps to have Clostridium difficile and was continued on Flagyl as well as other antibiotics.
Because of persistent septic picture and the inability to keep his blood pressure up despite maximum resuscitation, the patient was made comfort measures and allowed to expire.
Sigmoid colectomy [**2201-2-23**].
