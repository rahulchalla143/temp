She has also had increased LE edema due to steroids and wonders if this has hampered her mobility and feelings of worsening weakness.
Her pain is located in her lower back and radiates around to her groin on both sides and down her anterior thigh, right > left.
She was initially only taking vicodin QHS, but over the last couple of days she increased the frequency to every 4 hours and was still not getting good relief.
She feels more fatigued since her radiation therapy ([**Date range (1) 83909**]) and does not believe that radiation helped her pain or weakness.
She was given morphine 2 mg IV x 4, dexamethasone 4 mg x 1, and a vicodin.
On [**2109-11-15**] she had lumbar MRI which was significant for multiple abnormalities including infiltration of L4 resulting in a compression fracture with retropulsion of fragments and moderately severe spinal stenosis, and infiltration of T11 with associated deformity of the right lateral aspect of the spinal cord.
Most notably, she had multilevel vertebral involvement including T2, T11, T7 and L4 with the suggestion of spinal cord involvement at T2 and T11.

She was evaluated by ortho spine, who fitted her for a TLSO brace and [**Location (un) 2848**] J collar which she is to wear when out of bed.
She was started on a long-acting narcotic, with PRN morphine for breakthrough pain, with excellent effect.
At the time of discharge, orthopedic surgery is considering surgical decompression after a few more weeks pass, as her risk of wound healing complications will be lower after some time passes from radiation treatment.
Patient has not been treated with any chemotherapy to date as this is a recently new diagnosis.
Her urinary retention was believed to possibly be secondary to her increased narcotic regimen vs neurogenic bladder.
She was initially unable to be extubated and she was found to have a pneumonia and was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for four days.
Her antibiotics were stopped and she was successfully extubated.
