We believe that this happened because you might not be taking your medications properly.
We have reviewed your medication list and noticed that you have been prescibed some very sedating medications in the past.
Given that you are on dialysis, many of these medications can build up in your blood and cause confusion or oversedation.
We have provided you with a list of medications below.
DO NOT TAKE MEDICATIONS NOT ON THIS LIST.
These medications have been discontinued because we are concerned that they are contributing to your altered mental status.
We have set you up with a neurology appointment so that your medications can be properly dosed.
