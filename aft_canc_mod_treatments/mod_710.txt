You were in the ICU originally and were treated empirically for pneumonia, volume overload and COPD/asthma exacerbation as it was unclear what was causing your symptoms.
After discussion with you and your family, given the poor prognosis of your disease, the decision was made to focus on comfort and you are being discharged to a hospice facility for further care.
You were noted to have urethritis and pain, likely partially due to your foley cathether.
Urology made recommendations about the type of foley catheter to use and this was implemented prior to discharge.
You had a paracentesis performed for comfort prior to discharge.
