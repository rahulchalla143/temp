At that     time, the Prograf, Rapamycin was discontinued but the     patient was continued on low dose Prednisone.

The patient's initial CMV PCR analysis was positive for CMV, for which the patient was started on ganciclovir.
The patient also continued to show some signs and symptoms of acute rejection of the graft and on the [**12-12**], the patient had a BUN of 11 and a creatinine of 1.6.
During the initial part of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, she continued to spike intermittent fevers as high as 103.0 F., on [**12-16**] with the infusion of intravenous IG therapy.
The patient was scheduled for a nephrectomy of the allograft on [**2196-12-23**].
Just prior to scheduling the nephrectomy, the patient's creatinine and BUN had improved and the nephrectomy was put on hold by recommendations from the primary Renal medicine service.
Small bowel perforation was found with frank extravasation of enteric contents.
The patient had an exploratory laparotomy and resection of the mid-jejunum with primary anastomosis and an allograft nephrectomy.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the PACU in stable condition.
The patient was brought back to the Operating Room with the initial diagnosis of perforated small bowel and exploratory laparotomy procedure was performed with primary repair of the small bowel perforation.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the PACU in stable condition.
Following the surgery, the patient continued on antibiotics and was treated for her metabolic issues.
Following the surgery, the patient continued with hemodialysis on a regular schedule and her treatments for the post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.
The wound continued to heal by secondary intention with regular dressing changes.
Over that time, the patient continued to spike intermittently and received multiple blood cultures, urine cultures, and chest x-rays which could not locate a source for the infection.
The patient also continued to remain with pancytopenia which was followed by Hematology/Oncology regarding her diagnosis of lymphoma and the patient continued on hemodialysis.
The patient also had a catheter infection of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus which was treated with Vancomycin for 14 days.
On the 5th the patient continued to spike and at that point had a full work-up for febrile origins in anticipation of discharging the patient to Rehabilitation Services.
The patient is chronically pancytopenic requiring blood transfusions.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended, obese, incision healing with secondary intention; good granulation tissue and no signs of infection.
Status post allograft nephrectomy.
Bowel resection for perforation secondary to     lymphoproliferative disorder.

The patient is     currently on 12 of 14 doses and will require two more     doses of Vancomycin before discharging.
To Rehabilitation Services.
The patient should continue on intravenous Vancomycin     which should be renally dosed.
The patient will require extensive Physical Therapy and     Occupational Therapy.
The patient is also scheduled for an endoscopic     examination with ultrasounds on [**2197-2-10**], at 11 a.m. at     [**Hospital Ward Name 1950**] One.
The patient will also require a CT scan of the torso     which should be done with intravenous contrast and     scheduled with Dialysis.
The patient should have basic laboratory studies, Chem-7,     CBC, drawn twice a week to monitor the pancytopenia and     chemistries.
The patient should also have Vancomycin levels checked     regularly and to have the Vancomycin dosed if the level     falls below 15.
