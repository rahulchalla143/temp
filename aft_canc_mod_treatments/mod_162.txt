LABS: [**2116-12-3**] 11:20AM   WBC-22.5  RBC-1.76  HGB-5.6  HCT-16.3  MCV-93 MCH-31.8 MCHC-34.2  RDW-20.0 PT-25.8  PTT-35.9  INR(PT)-4.9 GLUCOSE-153  UREA N-78  CREAT-1.6  SODIUM-137  POTASSIUM-4.6 CHLORIDE-104 TOTAL CO2-22  ANION GAP-16 CALCIUM-8.0  PHOSPHATE-3.3  MAGNESIUM-2.6  Brief Hospital Course: Assessment:  75 year old man with history of Atrail Fibrillation and left sided thrombus on Coumadin with  4-5 days of melena and associated anemia determined to be secondary to gastric AVMs successfully cauderized.
1) GI BLEED:  After presenting to the ED with 4-5 days of melena and HCT 16.3 in the setting of INR of 4.9, Mr. [**Known lastname 7458**] anticoagulation was discontinued and he was given 4 units PRBC, 4 units FFP, SC Vit.
Diltiazem, Losartan and furosemide were held for volume depletion.
On [**12-4**], he underwent EGD and was found to have ulcer at the GE junction with stigmata of recent bleeding but no active bleeding.
After EGD and stabilization of vital signs, Mr. [**Known lastname 7457**] was transferred to the floor, where he was monitored for recurrent GI bleed with vital signs, serial HCT checks, serial abdominal exams, and stool collection.
His INR was followed and he was treated with Protonix.
Coumadin was at first held due to risk of re-bleed, then restarted with a heparin bridge on [**12-6**] in consulation with GI.
After restarting Coumadin and heparin it was noted that the patient's HCT had not elevated appropriately after a transfusion of 1 unit PRBC given for his MDS.
He was transfused a second unit overnight, and the following day, he was noted to have melena.
Nasogastric lavage was performed to assess whether the previously identified esophageal ulcer was bleeding; no blood was seen on NGL.
He was transfused an additional 2 units of PRBC and a repeat EGD was performed on [**12-8**].
Anticoagulation with Coumadin and heparin was started again on [**12-10**], and for the duration of his hospitalization the patient remained hemodynamically stable and without signs of GI bleeding.
Diltiazem, Losartan and furosemide were restarted prior to discharge.
Aspirin was held and the patient was instructed to restart as an outpatient in consultation with his PCP.
2) Atrial fibrillation and left atrium thrombus:  The patient has A Fib and a known left atrial thrombus normally treated with Coumadin 5mg daily.
The patient's GI bleed on admission occurred in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR of 4.9, so coumadin was held and anticoagulation was reversed in the ED with 4 units Fresh Frozen Plasma and Vitamin K. Given his known left atrial thrombus and associated increased risk of stroke, it was recommended by cardiology that he restart Coumadin as soon as the GI team considered his GI bleed stable.
Therefore, anticoagulation with Coumadin and heparin bridge was started on [**12-6**].
After the patient's recurrent GI bleed, anticoagulation was again stopped, then restarted on [**12-10**].
He was kept on his digoxin throughout the hospitalization.
The addition of a beta blocker to his medication regimen was considered, but it was decided that it would be best to start this as an outpatient, in consultation with his cardiologist.
By the day of discharge, the patient's INR was therapeutic at 2.1 and he was discharged home on coumadin 5mg daily.
The patient was placed on 2L oxygen via nasal cannula, and EKG was obtained to rule-out cardiac ischemia EKG was unchanged from prior.
A 10-day course of Levofloxacin was started.
By discharge, the patient no longer had an oxygen requirement, and only noted mild dyspnea while in certain positions, which he attributed to his enlarged liver exerting pressure on his lungs.
He was continued on his anagrelide, but thalidomide was held due to hospital regulations.
The patient was advised to follow-up with his outpatient hematologist upon discharge and continue medications as prescribed.
He was continued on statin therapy throughout his hospitalization.
Diltiazem and Losartan were initially held, then resumed once the patient was stable and it appeared that his blood pressure could tolerate them.
The addition of a beta blocker to his medication regimen was considered, but it was decided that this could be started as an outpatient.
Aspirin was held, and the patient should restart it as an outpatient, in consultation with his PCP or cardiologist.
The patient was maintained on a cardiac diet while hospitalized.
