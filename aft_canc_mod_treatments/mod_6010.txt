This is a 75 yo F with metastatic (brain/bone) transitional cell CA of bladder, here from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with tachypnea (RR 40-42), hypoxia (70s%), tachycardia (119-128), hypotension (62/40), temp 98.
She was given IV levofloxacin and referred to the ED.
She was intubated with etomidate and succinylcholine, given phenylephrine bolus prior to intubation.
She had a L femoral line placed in nonsterile conditions, later pulled with a clean R IJ placed.

Endotracheal tube in satisfactory position as above.
Compression fracture of a lower thoracic vertebral body of indeterminate acuity.
Given concern for perineural tumor spread from the right cavernous sinus, this finding may relate to obstruction of drainage by the skull base mass.
Brief Hospital Course: Hospital course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 19704**] is a 75-year-old female with metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder who presented with hypoxic respiratory failure that was likely multifactorial in setting of tumor burden and possible multifocal pneumonia although aspiration is a consideration, and hemodynamic instability requiring aggressive volume resuscitation, pressor support with norepinephrine, and intubation.
The patient had last been treated for cancer, but her regimen has been on hold since [**Month (only) **] secondary to a hip fracture with subsequent poor performance status and medical issues related to her rehabiliation and chronic medical conditions.
Patient was extubated on [**2199-1-1**] per family desire to pursue comfort care given progressively worsening clinical status and died on [**2199-1-1**] at 12:35 PM.
She was intubated and required support throughout her hospitalization.
She was treated broadly with vancomycin (IV and PO), cefepime, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole for both anaerobic and pulmonary infections in addition to C. diff given leukocytosis.
# Septic shock: Patient was hypotensive on presentation and required high-volume resuscitation, pressor support with levophed.
Patient subsequently switched to phenylephrine as having episodes of hypotension associated with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Given evidence of worsening perfusion with oliguria and upward trend of lactate, she was subsequently placed back on levophed with minimal effect and continuing deterioration until her death.
# Metastatic transitional cell cancer: Patient was noted to have worsening metastasis on imaging as above.
She had received treatment in the past, which was limited of recent by a fall with resultant hip fracture and subsequent poor performance.
Tumor lysis syndrome in setting of burden was thought to be less likely.
# Thrombocytopenia with coagulopathy Patient noted to develop thrombocytopenia likely multifactorial etiology with marrow suppression, drug side effect from antibiotics (no known heparin usage).
