PT: 13.4  PTT: 24.3  INR: 1.1    Brief Hospital Course: 79 year old woman with PMH s/f CHF, HTN, asthma and hypothyroid who presented with lethargy and hypoxemia, found to be hyponatremic to 118 down from 133 9 days prior to admission and a newly depressed EF of 15% from 45% in [**Month (only) 956**].
Hyponatremia normalized with diuresis as detailed below.
EF was found to be 15% from 45% and the etiology of the precipitous drop remains unclear after ruling out ischemic etiologies with an unrevealing catheterization as detailed above.
Her creatinine improved with diuresis and at discharge was 1.0. .
# COPD: She was treated symptomatically with ipratropium nebs and started on Advair as an inpatient; albuterol nebs were held in the setting of decompensated heart failure.
She had no wheezes, cough or O2 requirement on discharge and was sent home on her home regimen of inhalers; Advair was not continued for discharge.
IV PPI was started and GI was consulted; their recommendation was for outpatient work-up since the patient's Hct remained stable and stool was brown 12 hours after the initial episode.
# NIDDM: Remained on sliding scale humalog while in house with well controlled blood glucose, and was sent home on her home dose of Glipizide.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM: Levothyroxine was increased to 75 mcg because of a high TSH and concern that tachycardia was contributing to her cardiomyopathy.
# HYPERTENSION: Continued home meds and remained stable.
Of note, she has received Epogen in the past for chronic anemia and may need additional doses if hct does not improve.
