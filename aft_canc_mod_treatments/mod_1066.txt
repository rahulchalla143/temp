IMAGING: [**8-21**] Chest Ct IMPRESSION:   1.
Compared with prior exam, there has been interval resolution of scattered bilateral consolidations, with interval appearance of new areas of discrete consolidation and ground-glass opacities in the left upper, right lower and right middle lobes suggesting multifocal pneumonia.
Mild perinephric stranding and cardiomegaly not significantly changed compared with prior exam.
Feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
Right subclavian line ends close if not beyond the superior cavoatrial junction.
Right PIC line can be traced as far as the lower margin of the clavicle.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 yo M w/POEMS syndrome and MDS a/w worsening motor fasciculations and decreased level of consciousness at rehab facility admitted for febrile neutropenia and hypotension with multifocal pneumonia.
He was treated with vancomycin, cefepime for pneumonia.
He intermittently required IV fluids and Levophed to maintain his MAP > 65.
He required stress dose hydrocortisone.
# Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated on [**8-20**] for hypoxic respiratory failure and airway protection secondary to pneumonia complicated by diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
He was initially treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and ambisome.
Ambisome was later switched to voriconazole due to persistent low potassium while on ambisome and an 8 day course of vancomycin and meropenem was completed for gram positive cocci in blood cultures.
The patient was actively diursed with IV lasix and electrolytes were repleated as needed for component of fluid overload.
He remained on a face tent to maintain oxygen saturation.
He received transfusions of packed red blood cells as need to maintain hematocrit about 21.
He also received platelet transfusions as need with a goal platelet of 40 given diffuse alveolar hemorrohage.
He was further treated with neupogen and prednisone; lenolidomide was held due to concern for neurotoxicity.
# Pain management: He has chronic pain throughout, including bladder spasms, and was treated with oxybutynin, dilaudid PRN, and fentanyl patches.
Fentanyl patches were intermittently discontinued when he had fevers.
Pain management was difficult with higher doses causing altered mental status.
Dilaudid was discontinued toward the end of hospitalization.
Once the decision was made to start hospice, patient's pain needs were met with IV hydrocortisone and morphine.
He was discharged with presciptions for hydrocortisone and oral morphine solution.
The patient was treated with antibiotics as described above.
Patient was receiving tube feeds through an NG tube, which became clogged.
Upon removal of the NG tube, patient began having nosebleeds and a discussion of replacing the tube vs. TPN vs. PEG was had with the family.
