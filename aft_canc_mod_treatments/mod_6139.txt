Final Report HISTORY: Status post suboccipital craniectomy for cerebellar mass lesion removal.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT  In the interval, the patient has underwent a right-sided suboccipital craniectomy with removal of the previously described predominantly cystic right cerebellar mass in this patient with known non-small cell lung cancer.
The findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37564**] shortly after exam acquisition at approximately 4 p.m.

Weanin    [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    68 year old man with cerebellar hemorrhage, with EVD.
Persistent right frontal catheter terminating adjacent to the third ventricle, unchanged mild ventricular dilatation and intraventricular hemorrhage layering the occipito-ventricular horns.
IMPRESSION: In comparison with the prior examination, no significant change is demonstrated, persistent intraventricular blood layering the occipital horns, unchanged right frontal shunt catheter terminating at the level of the third ventricle through the right frontal burr hole, minimal right frontal pneumoencephalus.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient status post suboccipital craniotomy.
Blood products are seen in the surgical bed.
Postoperative changes with blood products and expected post-surgical change in the posterior fossa.
New signal change in the right basal ganglia could be explained from placement of the ventricular drain as this area was traversed by the drain on the CT of [**2131-5-16**].

FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of a right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter.
Interval removal of right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter, with small foci of blood and air along the catheter tract, but no large hemorrhage.
The procedure was uneventful.
A right frontal external ventricular drain was placed for csf diversion as there was mild HCP.
He tolerated that procedure well.
He was not placedon antiepileptics or steroids post operatively.
He underwent a clamp trial and the EVD was removed on [**2131-5-18**].
He was transferred to the step down unit where he had [**3-6**] episodes per day of vomiting that seem to be related to motion and position change.
