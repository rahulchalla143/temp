Her AMS was likely secondary to hypoventilation due to opiates as she became lethargic and desaturated after administration of oxycodone, prompting initiation of BiPAP.
Her long acting opiates were discontinued as noted below.
Her long acting opiates were stopped and her respiratory status improved and she was gradually transitioned from BiPAP to face mask and eventually weaned to 2L nasal cannula before call out to the floor.
She had evidence of mild pulmonary edema on CXR and was given gentle diuresis with IV lasix 10mg x2.
She was also given albuteral and ipratropium nebs for her underlying asthma/COPD due to concern she may have had a COPD/Asthma exacerbation.
#Back pain:  She presented with pronounced back pain which was moderately controlled at home on oxycontin 10mg TID, vicodin for break through.
We continued home oxycontin 10mg TID and start oxycodone for breakthrough; we transitioned to longer acting [**Doctor Last Name 360**] based on 24hr requirement.
However, she developed respiratory depression after the initiation of long acting opiates, and she was resumed on short acting opiates after she was briefly admitted to the ICU for respiratory monitoring in addition to hypoglycemia.
Prior to discharge, the patient's Lantus was decreased with plans for outpatient follow up and insulin readjustment.
Stable on home albuterol and advair, continued during admission.
Of note, she did receive additional nebs in the ICU for concern of a COPD flare.
