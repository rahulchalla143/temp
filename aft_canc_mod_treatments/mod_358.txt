Admission Date:  [**2118-11-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-12-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-4-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2090**] Chief Complaint: difficulty breathing, R eyelid heaviness/double vision   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Plasmapheresis catheter placement   History of Present Illness: The pt is a 43 yo female w/ [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 10332**] [**Last Name (un) 2902**], s/p thymectomy for thymoma in [**2115**] which was found to be metastatic to lung and abdomen.
The pt had similar sx of tiredness and diplopia 3y ago (but never dyspnea) and was subsequently diagnosed w/ MG.  At the time of dx, the pt was found to have a thymoma, so per Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**], the pt underwent induction of chemoradiotherapy followed by median sternotomy and anterior thymic resection; she was also found at that time to have metastases to the L pleura.
Following the initial surgery in [**2115**], the pt remained asymptomatic.
Given the extent of the pt's disease, the pt discussed her treatment options w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] and her oncologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and she has decided to undergo surgery (L extrapleural pneumonectomy w/ additional resection of L suprarenal mass).
Her surgery is scheduled for this Weds, [**2118-11-30**].
Pt also notes mild abdominal pain since her bx in [**9-18**]; immediately after the procedure, the pt says she developed an "infection" involving fever and "yellowish stuff" draining from her umbilicus; the fever and discharge have since resolved, but mild pain persists, intermittent and sharp in the epigastric/LLQ area "right under the skin."
The pt denies fever (except as above), chills, sick contacts, recent URI, HA, dizziness, difficulty chewing or swallowing, dysarthria, neck pain/stiffness, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain (except as above), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, difficulty voiding, extremity pain/focal weakness/numbness/tingling.
Onc History: MG; taken off mestinon and prednisone (per taper) in [**Month (only) 216**]; has been symptomatic since [**2115**] -  Metastatic thymoma.
Prior treatment: Three cycles of preoperative cisplatin, Adriamycin and Cytoxan.
One cycle of postoperative carboplatin and Taxol, but carboplatin was discontinued due to infusional reaction.
Coordination: Finger-nose-finger normal, heel-to-shin normal, RAMs normal.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 43 year old R-handed woman with a history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] status post thymoma resection in [**2115**], now with recent metastases of malignant thymoma to her lungs and retroperitoneal space, who comes to the ED for increased shortness of breath and episodes of double vision.
Since she did complain of double vision since being weaned off mestinon and prednisone, Mestinon was restarted on [**11-26**] and settled on a dose of 60mg Q4H on [**12-12**] given sweating and chest pressure with the higher doses.
She also received plasmapheresis for a total 5 cycles between [**11-29**] to [**12-6**] as she remained tachypneic and had an O2 requirement a few days into her admission.
Prednisone was restarted at 60 mg QD, which lead to some improvement in her breathing after several days.
She was kept on close monitoring including telemetry, continuous O2 sats and q4 hour neuro and vitals checks.
Her double vision gradually improved with the therapies and her fatigue, which was mild, also resolved.
She may also need formal pulmonary function tests as an outpatient if she decides to proceed with a surgical procedure in the future.
[**Last Name (un) **]/ONC: Thoracic surgery and hematology/oncology were consulted regarding the plan for left  extrapleural pneumonectomy w/ additional resection of L suprarenal mass given her worsening myasthenia and shortness of breath.
Plan which was discussed with patient, her family and primary team would be to re-evaluate her after treatment of her myasthenic crisis and stabilization after discharge.
At that point, de-bulking surgery could be reconsidered.
Oncology recommended Alimta chemotherapy which they will set up as an outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who is covering for patient's primary oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10333**].
She was continued on aspirin only.
