Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 69005**] had no intra-operative complications, post-operatively he was NPO with a Dilaudid PCA, a subcutaneous pain pump, intravenous hydration, telemetry monitoring, foley catheter, and nasogastric tube.
He experienced confusion and agitation post-operatively which was treated with restraints and Haldol, an EKG was negative for ischemia, he was afebrile, and hemodynamically stable with a hematocrit of 29.8, the confusion had resolved by POD 1.
On POD 2 he had hypovolemia with decreased urine output which responded well to intravenous bolussing.
On POD 2 he had intermittent confusion with desaturation which improved on nasal cannula; chest x-ray and chest CT scan were negative for an embolus, he had a small right pleural effusion without evidence of aspiration.
A geriatrics consult was placed and the narcotics were discontinued.
On POD 4 he had +flatus and a bowel movement, his diet was advanced which he tolerated well, he had improvement in his mental status with orientation to person, time, and place.
On POD 8, he had an episode of emesis with desaturation, was transferred to the ICU for furher management of aspiration pneumonia confirmed by CT and X-ray, broad spectrum antibiotics were started, he was maintained on oxygen therapy, a nasogastric tube was placed, and he was NPO with initiation of TPN.
On POD 11, he required mechanical ventilation with intubation, was febrile with leukocytosis of 20k, received a transfusion for a hematocrit of 23; all microbiology cultures had been negative to date.
His incision was noted to have bilious drainage, he was taken back to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy, repair of enterotomy, abdominal wash-out and wound closure, with findings of an enterocutaneous fistula with wound abscess due to suture erosion.
Post-operatively he required additional transfusions for a hematocrit of 24, with a good response.
Tube feeds were started via a Dobhoff tube, but was stopped because the patient had increased drainage from his wound.
A VAC dressing was placed over the wound for drainage purposes.
Throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, he had been delirious, confused, and agitated at times requiring haldol for sedation.
When the patient's bowel function returned, he was started on a diet of nectar thickened liquids, pureed solids with PO meds crushed in puree.
Supervision with meals by nursing staff were done to maintain aspiration precautions.
His TPN was discontinued in order to see if this would increase his appetite and we continued to encourage PO intake.
Before discharge, the patient had another swallow evaluation and demonstrated signs of aspiration of thin liquids by straw sips and his diet was changed to a thin liquid, soft solid diet without the use of a straw.
A PICC line was placed should the patient require TPN.
On the day of discharge, the patient had cloudy urine in his foley bag and was having liquidy stools.
