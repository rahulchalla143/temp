The latter is attributed to the occurrence of lambda light chains as dimers whose serum [**1-18**]- life is approximately 3 times longer than that of monomeric kappa light chains.
Monoclonal light chains are found in serum of patients with multiple myeloma, the light chain variant of MM, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, mu-heavy chain disease, primary amyloidosis, light chain deposition disease, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, and lymphoproliferative diseases such as B-CLL.
Measurement of free light chain concentration in serum is useful for diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring disease activity and following response to therapy of these disorders.

LINE PLACEMENT Reason: Check HD line placement.
FINDINGS: Right IJ dialysis catheter tip lies in the region of the lower SVC.
THORACIC AND LUMBAR SPINE: On a background of diffuse demineralization, there is focal kyphosis within the upper/mid thoracic spine secondary to a compression fracture of a upper/mid thoracic vertebral body with approximately 70% loss of vertebral body height.
Wedge compression fracture of an upper/mid thoracic vertebral body, age indeterminate.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: 73-year-old female with dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 20%), s/p nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma in [**2119**] with left solitary kidney, hypertension, diabetes, MGUS that presented with 1-month history of nausea and vomiting thought to be related to cholelithiasis with plan for initial plan for ERCP.
One consideration is multiple myeloma given findings on skeletal survey.
HOSPITAL COURSE: # Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient has underlying renal disease and is s/p right nephrectomy in setting of renal cell carcionoma in [**2119**] with left solitary kidney.
She was subsequently underwent diuresis with thought that poor forward output in setting of cardiomyopathy could be the etiology; however, this as well did not improve her renal function.
Renal consultants suggested transfer to the CCU with placement of a SG catheter to assess volume status and possibly initiation HD or UF.
She had two sessions of HD in the CCU, which she tolerated, without any fluid removed.
She subsequently continued HD on the cardiology floor with fluid removal limited by hypotension at times.
She had associated pleural effusions with goal to be net negative with dialysis, which was possible with downtitration of carvedilol.
She should continue to receive dialysis with goal net negative given pleural effusions.
She received vein mapping during hospitalization for potential future placement of fistula access on non-dominant left arm, which should be spared from blood draws, blood pressure measurements, or other procedures.
She was started on sevelamer, nephrocaps.
A bone marrow biopsy was discussed with the patient who refused as she wanted to discuss this procedure with her primary care doctor.
She was continued on carvedilol as above.
As above, she had a PA catheter placed in the CCU, with values of mean RA 26, v-waves to 50mmHg, RVSP/RVEDP ~50/14 and PA pressures 50/22 on entry; Mean wedge 19mmHg; PA pressures increased to 60/28 after the procedure.
TSH was normal, and cortisol was appropriately elevated in setting of acute illness.
Iron and B12 studies were suggestive of iron deficiency for which oral iron with anti-constipation regimen was started.
Etiology likely multifactorial including passive congestion from chronic heart failure, possible medication side effect from amiodarone, resolving biliary process.
Non-hepatic causes such as thyroid disorder or rhabdomyolysis unlikely given TSH and CK.
#  Chronic pain - Primary pain generator is her back for which XR showed wedge compression fracture of an upper/mid thoracic vertebral body (age indeterminate).
Patient was continued on fentanyl patch and PO dilaudid.
