Her sedation was slowly weaned and she was extubated successfully on the day after admission.
She continued to require oxygen by nasal canula to maintain O2 sats in the 90s.
She was continued on her fluticasone/salmeterol 500/50 and albuterol and ipatropium nebulizer treatments prn.
She will need supplemental O2 on discharge.
## s/p nephrectomy: pt tolerated the procedure well.
Her wound was C/D/I at discharge after staples were removed.
An NG tube was placed which returned 200 cc of bilious, nonbloody fluid.
As patient's operation was not within the peritoneal cavity but retroperitoneal, it was believed to be more likely ileus in the setting of increased pain med requirements.
Indeed her prolonged hospital course was secondary to a prostracted ileaus that was initially managed with NGT/decompression however by POD [**11-28**] the NG was remvoed, her diet was advanced and she tolerated it well.
She was placed on RTC Reglan toward the end of her course to expedite resolution; GI was curbsided and beleived she has a protracted ileus that was responded to conservative measures.
In addition surgery was consulted and recommended similar conservative measures.

Was no longer requiring insulin at time of discharge from the ICU.
Was maintained on heparin SC TID while in house.
