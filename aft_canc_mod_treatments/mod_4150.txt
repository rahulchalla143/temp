She was started on Unasyn and watched closely in the ICU.
She was started on subcutaneous heparin, but she was not fully anticoagulated for the finding of pulmonary emboli because she had active GI bleeding (bleeding noted at the time of ERCP and guaiac postive stools).
On [**4-30**], a picc line was placed and she was started on TPN.
A plan was formulated to keep her on TPN with bowel rest for two weeks to allow her duodenum/bile ducts to heal.
On [**5-1**], she was transfused with two units of blood for blood loss anemia.
She was started on a low dose heparin drip.
They recommended 6 months of anticoagulation, but given the fact that she still had active loss of blood from her GI tract and because she was at increased risk for falls based on her age and health status, they agreed that IVC filter placement would be adequate treatment/prevention for the time being.
A vascular consult was obtained and an IVC filter was placed on [**5-7**].
After this, her heparin drip was stopped.
A CT scan was done which showed improving pneumomediastinum and retroperitoneal air.
Her picc line was removed.
