PENICILLIN SENSITIVITY AVAILABLE ON REQUEST.
The patient was started on broad antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and zosyn.
He was aggressively fluid resuscitated (>12L) and required pressors for approximately 24hrs.
Antibiotics were changed to naficillin/cipro/flagyl given sensitivities of cultures.
Pt was changed to high-dose Levaquin and Flagyl to complete 6 week course.
Patient was treated initially in the MICU with vancomycin & zosyn, and ultimately tailored to nafcillin, cipro, flagyl on the floor.
Plastic surgery and neurosurgery took the patient to the OR together on [**2135-6-20**] for initial debridement and was thereafter followed by plastic surgery who took him back to the OR on [**6-27**] for flap closure.
He was kept on a wound vac.
Plastic surgery recommending that patient is able to be d/c'ed with [**Hospital1 **] dressing changes and outpatient follow-up, with plan to consider another skin graft in the future.
# Osteomyelitis: because the wound had exposed vertebral processes (by definition osteomyelitis), ID recommended several weeks of IV antibiotics.

The patient has no known prior malignancy, although he did not have any medical care for over 3 decades.
# ARF: On presentation, the patient had a slight bump in his creatinine, thought to be prerenal azotemia versus contrast nephropathy versus ATN secondary to either medication or hypovolemic insult during sepsis and then again with second hypotensive episode following incomplete fluid resuscitation in the PACU following his second surgery.
He was treated with IVF and all medications were renally dosed.
Cipro and flagyl were switched to IV, but the patients po intake continues to be poor so medications were restarted po.
