# Follicular Lymphoma: Patient was admitted for allo stem cell transplant with ATG/TLI/clofarabine preconditioning on a study protocol.
The total lymphocyte irradiation (TLI) directed at his lymph nodes also led to increased erythema of his face, neck and back; because it was directed particularly at a large lymph node in right sided cervical chain, patient secondarily experienced increased pain in right cheek from radiation-induced mucositis.
Partial matched sibling donor stem cells were transfused on [**6-19**], after which he appeared to have mild hemolysis and had his first neutropenic fever.
# Neutropenic Fevers: Patient began having neutropenic fevers on [**6-19**] and was started on cefepime that evening.
He was started on Vancomycin the following day, which was discontinued on [**6-22**] after 48 hours of being afebrile.
# Acute Renal Failure: On presentation, patient's creatinine was 1.3, above his baseline of 1.0.
Creatinine improved briefly to 1.2 with fluids but was noted to increase acutely in next couple of days up to 1.7 in setting of ATG treatment.
With blood transfusion and normal saline boluses, patient's creatinine trended back down to 1.0 and was stable for nearly one week.
Once fluids were stopped after clofarabine treatment and stem cell infusion, patient's creatinine was again noted to increase to 1.5.
He may have been experiencing a serum sickness type of reaction secondary to the ATG still in his system, causing inflammatory changes and extravasation of fluids resulting in intravascular volume depletion.
On [**6-20**], he was started on [**Hospital1 **] dosing of IV solumedrol to attempt to decrease the effects of any ATG remaining in his system.
Patient had been started on ursodiol on Day -2 for VOD prophylaxis.
# Hypoxia: Thought to be multifactorial initially- edema, engraftment, and infection.
He was started on vancomycin in addition to the cefipime he had been on for several days due to neutropenic fever.
He was also on steroids for possible engraftment syndrome and being treated for laryngeal edema.
He initially improved with treatment of all these etiologies.
While intubated, he was continued on a broad spectrum of antibiotics.
His sedation was decreased and precedex was given to help improve mental status.
He was eventually extubated and satting well on face mask.
Chest tube was placed.
Patient continued to get aggressive anti-fungal treatment for a worsening aspergillis pneumonia which eventually cleared; per BMT, will continue micafungin.
Patient is s/p 2 intubations x 10 and 8 days, is now Day 3 post extubation and doing well.
He was continued on vancomycin and switched to meropenem from cefepime.
His antifungal coverage was initially micafungin which switched to andilufungin.
Voriconazole was then switched to micofungin since his LFTs increased thought to be possible due to voriconazole hepato-toxicity.
# Laryngeal Edema/Airway Protection: Patient had total lymph node radiation pre-transplant with resultant mucositis, causing edema and potential airway compromise.
He was initially placed on steroids for this issue, and is now continued on IV solumedrol.
He sporadically recieved Haldol PRN for agitation and delerium; however, has not needed it in a week.
# Follicular lymphoma: s/p ATG, TLI and allotransplant [**6-19**].
He was continued on antifungal coverage, Acyclovir, Cyclosporine 110 MG IV q12 hours, and Mycophenolate Mofetil 1250 mg IV BID.
Pt received one dose of inhaled pentamidine on [**8-16**] (a q4week medication) for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
He was not able to take PO/NG meds due to ileus and Bactrim was not given due to renal failure.
Voriconazole was switched to Micogunfin to limit liver toxicity and we stopped TPN which is associated with liver failure.
Required multiple platelet transfusions (every other day) for goal ?
He was placed on labetalol 200 TID and Hydral 10 PRN.
He is on amlodipine 5 at home.
# Nutrition: He received tube feeds; NGT dc'ed 2 days ago.
He was monitored with hemolysis labs.
He was started on a furosemide gtt and showed a steady improvement in this creatinine.
On [**8-9**], he was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
Patient remained intubated throughout majority of the ICU course as his mental status (likely [**2-25**] prolonged sedation and uremia) posed a barrier to extubation.
Because of prolonged intubation, patient had tracheostomy placed.
Required increasing ventilator support.
Was ultimately withdrawn from the ventilator at the request of family, at which point the patient died.
Patient had history of this in past and was placed on metoprolol for rate control.
Patient was started empirically on antibiotics for possible cholangitis, and a PTC was placed.
Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Patient also remained thrombocytopenic and anemia and in the setting of acute renal failure, there was concern for a transplant associated thrombotic [**Doctor First Name **].
Throughout the ICU course patient required several platelet and blood transfusion.
On [**8-11**] at 544 AM the patient passed away from hypoxic respiratory failure after being removed from the ventilator at the wishes of his family.
