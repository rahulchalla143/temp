He underwent a TURBT for hematuria that ultimately revealed a grade [**2-21**] muscle invasive bladder carcinoma.
PRIOR MEDICATIONS:  None  ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Otherwise negative.
It was ultimately determined that he would undergo an orthotopic diversion and a continent cutaneous diversion with ilial loop.
On [**2145-4-9**], he was admitted to [**Hospital6 649**] and he underwent a radical cystoprostatectomy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 986**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] assisting.
The patient received 12.5 liters intraoperatively of intravenous fluid.
He received 1 unit of autologous blood intraoperatively.
He was given Kefzol, gentamicin and Flagyl preoperatively.
He left the Operating Room with a suprapubic tube, a Foley catheter, JP x2, ureteral stents x2 and nasogastric tube, right IJ triple lumen central venous line, as well as a right radial A-line.
Specimens from the operation included the bladder prostate, bilateral pelvic lymph nodes and distal ureteral cuff margins x2.
He was intubated and went to the Intensive Care Unit overnight.
He was being maintained on intravenous fluids and epidural.
His propofol drip for sedation was weaned off steadily.
He was given pulmonary toilet and ultimately easily weaned from extubation.
NEUROLOGIC:  Postoperatively, the patient was weaned off of his sedation within the first 24 hours after the surgery.
He was on no beta blockers and no electrocardiogram changes were noted postoperatively.
He was given an aggressive pulmonary toilet, including prn albuterol and Atrovent nebulizer treatments, incentive spirometry, chest physiotherapy and early mobilization.
There was some wound erythema and drainage noted by postoperative day #5.
If there was a small leak, the patient was recommended to continue his nasogastric tube to suction, bowel rest, intravenous fluids, TPN and to add some somatostatin.
This ultimately became the patient's regimen, therefore by [**4-16**] the patient had been started on somatostatin 100 mcg subcutaneous q 8.
His nasogastric tube was to suction.
He was getting serial flushes through the suprapubic tube and Foley catheter.
The wound itself, erythema and leak ultimately subsided and was not putting out much and he was given bowel rest over the next several days.
It was a rather encouraging study radiographically, however once the patient arrived to the floor after receiving gastrografin his wounds at the site where it had previously been draining at the most inferior margin began to drain copious amounts of enteric contents.
This was done after the patient was actually allowed to start sipping fluids, as his nasogastric tube had been removed prior to discharge.
He still had a suprapubic tube and Foley catheter in place.
The central venous line had been previously discontinued and he was utilizing a right basilic double lumen PICC for his TPN and intravenous fluid access.
He was tolerating a diet and passing gas and had formed bowel movements at this point in his postoperative course and it was felt that due to his complication, the best scenario would be to send him home with TPN, minimal po intake, maximal 500 cc q 24 hours and to bring him back at a later date for definitive fistulectomy and repair.
The patient understands that he will require a future operation and given the type of procedure that he had, there was a high degree of risk for complication postoperatively which he ultimately suffered from.
He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**] in the office in a couple of weeks, at which time he should probably receive a fistulogram to better understand the anatomy through this fistula.
Additionally, the patient will continue TPN as stated and at that time of follow up Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**] will discuss surgical options in conjunction with general surgery and Dr.[**Name (NI) 22019**] service.
Somatostatin 100 mcg subcutaneous q 8 2.
Mucomyst 20% 5 cc solution diluted, 30 cc normal saline to be flushed through the suprapubic tube and Foley catheter for mucous plugging.
Percocet 5/325 1 to 2 tablets po q 4 to 6 prn  The patient will be on a sliding scale insulin regimen to cover his sugar needs, as well.
Status post radical cystoprostatectomy with ilial neobladder and urethral anastomosis complicated by postoperative enterocutaneous fistula and question enterovesical fistula, vesical being the neobladder in this instance, not his native bladder as that was removed.
