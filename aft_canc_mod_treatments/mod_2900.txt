Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE 58yo F with PMH recurrent NSCLC stage IIIA s/p chemo/XRT c/b gastroparesis, a/w persistant N/V, hospital course c/b MICU stay for HTN emergency w IPH, urinary retention, now w well-controlled BP, foley out without retention, no nausea/vomitting, discharged home.
Baseline HTN was thought to [**2-6**] nausea, vomitting, and urinary retention (found on imaging, believed to iatrogentic from anticholinergic medications).
At time of discharge patient's BP was well controlled w SBP 102-140 over 24hrs.
During hospitalization, patient had improvement in nausea with narrowing of medications (it was thought that baseline nausea was being exacerbated by large amount of medications she was receiving).

Her medications were narrowed, and she had her foley pulled w/o additional retention .
# s/p ICH: As mentioned above, on [**2-1**], in setting of HTN urgency, patient found to have 1.8cm basal ganglia bleed on CT. Neurosurg evaluated and felt that no surgical evacuation was needed.
Her aspirin was discontinued.
Imaging demonstrated stable metastases, with suspected brain met, but LP showed only 1 atypical cell.
Further therapy was deferred to outpatient primary oncologist.
Improved on nystatin and floconazole.
Patient was continued on home symbicort, albuterol, ipratropium, fluticasone propionate.
