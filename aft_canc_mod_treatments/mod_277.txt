Nonspecific white matter changes in the cerebral white matter on both sides, likely due to sequelae of chronic small vessel occlusive disease, with other etiologies being less likely, due to lack of IV contrast enhancement.
Brief Hospital Course: # Fever and Neutopenia: Patient initially covered with broad spectrum antibiotics including Vancomycin and Cefepime.
As mental status progressively deteriorated (see below) antibiotics were changed to Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin, Vancomycin and Acyclovir for meninigitis coverage.
LP was not consistent with bacterial meningitis, but since WBC was poly predominant meningitis doses of antibiotics were administered.
Patient was started on Keppra and Ativan, and mental status cleared.
Goals of care were changed to comfort measures only on [**4-23**], and confirmed on [**4-24**], but family decided to discontinue CMO order on [**4-25**].
After further conversations with family, the decision was made to make her FULL CODE and to proceed with further chemotherapy.
She was given aggressive hydration with bicarb solution to keep her urine alkalinized (pH>8.0), promoting elimination of methotrexate.
[**4-28**]: Keppra was uptiratred from 750 mg to 1000 mg IV BID [**4-29**]: New hives on back.
Pt c/o itchiness however only topical sarna lotion was used in favor of avoiding sedating medications.
She was noted to have body tremors, which subsided briefly after 1 mg of Ativan then returned.
Multiple doses of ativan were given to little effect.
Acyclovir was started for concern of HSV encephalitis.
Vancomycin was started.
Pt was loaded with phenytoin 1 g followed by 100 mg IV Q8 hrs, Dexamethasone 10 mg IV then 4 mg IV BID.
A lumbar puncture was performed for interval check of lymphoma in CNS and pt was also given IT Ara-C. [**5-4**]: Pt remained in status despite the multiple anti-epileptics and pt was transferred to the ICU for phenobarbital administration.
MICU course:  She was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for elective intubation for initiation of phenobarbital  # Sedation/ Unresponsiveness:  Her mental status continued to be nonresponsive for >1 week.
# Seizures/Status Epilepticus:  She was initially on continuous EEG monitorring.
Keppra and fosphenytoin were continued.
:  Intubated electively for phenobarb initiation without underlying acitve pulmonary issues.
Goals of care were revised, so all antibiotics were stopped.
# Hyponatremia: Urine lytes and osms were consistent with SIADH, likely secondry to her intracranial process.
She was s/p CHOP, MTX, and IT cytaribine.
Leukovorin was stopped given undetectable MTX levels.
Dexamethasone and PCP/HSV ppx were continued.
# Hypertension: well controlled on metoprolol  # Goals of care:  Given poor prognosis of her T-cell lymphoma as well as the complicated ICU course including bacteremia, the patient's family elected to extubate and move toward comfort measures.
All medications including antibiotics were stopped, dexamethasone was continued given chronic steroid use, morphine was started PRN.
Pt was given morphine drip for comfort and valium to suppress any seizure activity.
