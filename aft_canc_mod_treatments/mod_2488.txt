Central lines were placed and the patient was in grave condition.
The patient was intubated and sedated in the unit.
The patient remained in the unit anticoagulated on Heparin with chest tubes and nasogastric tube.

The patient was continued on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
His Haldol was changed and adjusted.
Heparin was discontinued on the patient on [**2185-1-13**], and Coumadin was begun since his INR was now therapeutic.

The patient's tube feeds continued.
The patient had a nasogastric tube placed by fluoroscopy on 0/25/02, and nutrition was once again involved as he was made NPO as previously stated.
The patient's INR was continuously adjusted to be 2.0 to 2.5 and Lovenox was temporarily used for two days until for a moment when his INR dropped below 2.0.
We continued Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
The patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells to adjust for hematocrit which had fallen to 22.0 range and Lopressor was changed to 50 mg p.o.
