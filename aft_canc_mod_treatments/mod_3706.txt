Inital ABG was notable for pH 7.58/pCO2 23.4/pO2 54/HCO3 21 on 2L of supplemental oxygen.
She was treated with albuterol and ipratropium nebs and 4L O2.
The patient was started on levofloxacin and was weaned 3L supplemental oxygen via NC.

-Ground-glass opacity in the upper lobes has improved from CXR of four days ago, consistent with an acute process.
Given the rapid improvement, differential diagnoses include infection, asymmetrical pulmonary edema, and, in the appropriate clinical setting, pulmonary hemorrhage.
ECHO [**2176-7-3**] IMPRESSION: Small secundum atrial septal defect with right-to-left flow at rest and with maneuvers.
She underwent right heart catheterization with Swan-Ganz cath placement on hospital day#3, which confirmed elevated pulmonary artery pressures (PASP 98, mean 58).
Following this, she was transferred to the MICU with a PA catheter for a monitored two-day sildenafil trial, which showed minimal response in PAP but more impressive symptomatic response in her exertional dyspnea and oxygen requirement.
Bubble echocardiagraphy demonstrated right to left interatrial flow at rest and with maneuvers, c/w Eisenmanger's syndrome through an apparent secundum ASD, thus implicating congenital heart disease as the most likely etiology of her pulm HTN.
After transfer to the floor, she was weaned off supplemental O2 and maintained O2 sats of 94-5% on room air at rest and 90-2% on room air with ambulation.
Given this improved performance, she was discharged to home without supplemental oxygen for outpatient follow-up at the [**Hospital1 18**] Pulmonary clinic.
In the setting of HCV, these elevations of Igs and auto-Abs could suggest mixed cryoglobulinemia, although further evaluation and HCV subtyping was not pursued during this admission.
Per Hepatology, she is not currently a good candidate for interferon treatment given its toxicity and the severity of her lung disease.
Opacities were considered most likely part of an infectious process such as atypical pneumonia, and she was started empirically on a week-long course of levofloxacin.
Her sputum production improved over this time, and CT at [**Hospital1 18**] showed interval improvement of the opacities.
These lesions spread over several days across her oral mucosa, and then had nearly resolved by the time of discharge.
Transient oropharyngeal petechiae were also noted.
Thrombocytopenia: Platelet counts during her hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] were low but stable, ranging from  94 to 115.
No evidence of HIT was observed while on prophylactic heparin.
Ranitidine was not continued at discharge given her thrombocytopenia.
Vaginal spotting: She reported occasional vaginal spotting during this admission, secondary to her known cervical HGSIL.
