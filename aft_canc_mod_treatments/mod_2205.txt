Patient was placed on Asacol but symptoms persisted.
Patient underwent bronchoscopy, found L mainstem obstruction, tried to bx but c/b bleeding, needed intubation for airway protection.
A rigid bronchoscopy was performed and a stent was placed in the left main stem with improved aeration of the left lower lobe.
In the trauma SICU, it was felt that she had a LLL PNA and was started on levofloxacin.
She was also found to be hypertensive after extubation and received on IV hydralazine.

Pneumonia/Leukocytosis - Patient developed leukocytosis in the trauma SICU but was also briefly on stress-dose steroids (for possible cuff leak).
