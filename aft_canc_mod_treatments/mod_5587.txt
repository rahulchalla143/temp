HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old female with a new diagnosis of large B cell lymphoma who was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from Bone Marrow Transplant Service for respiratory distress, urgent need for central venous access and initiation of CHOP chemotherapy in anticipation of tumor lysis syndrome.
In the hospital, she was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for presumed pneumonia.
She was transferred to Bone Marrow Transplant for initiation of chemotherapy on [**2130-11-23**].
Because of the lack for venous access and high likelihood of deterioration after the initiation of chemotherapy he was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
SLE diagnosed in [**2112**] complicated by end-stage renal disease requiring cadaveric renal transplant in [**2120**].
She was receiving azathioprine, cyclosporin, and prednisone for immunosuppression.
Her kidney transplant was very close match and she had no episodes of rejection.
Left hip avascular necrosis, status post replacement times two in [**2126**] and [**2130**].
Status post cholecystectomy done by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the [**Hospital6 256**].
Levothyroxine 50 once a day.
Verapamil SR 240 mg in the morning, 180 mg at night.
Colchicine 0.6 mg once a day.
Prednisone taper.
Heparin subcutaneous.
ABG drawn on 4 liters of nasal cannula returned at 7.38, 42, and 37.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Upon transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory distress and CHOP chemotherapy was started the same night.
The patient's large tumor burden in the chest and neck was initially treated with the cycle of CHOP chemotherapy followed by five days of Cytoxan and high-dose prednisone.
She received aggressive IV fluid hydration with sodium bicarbonate to alkalinize the urine.
On [**2131-11-2**], the patient was started on another chemotherapy regimen with an AZT and hydroxyurea.
The patient was initially thought to have pneumonia and was treated with antibiotics without significant success.
The patient remained on assist-control ventilation, sedated.
The plan was to readdress therapeutic pleural tap versus chest tube placement when she is more stable otherwise.
She developed diarrhea positive for C. difficile colitis and was started on Flagyl p.o.
However, because of the ileus which developed soon after, Flagyl had to be changed to IV vancomycin 125 mg p.o.
She developed a fever and was started on cefepime with vancomycin IV.
The patient remained afebrile on antibiotics for three days.
Therefore, AmBisome was added to her antibiotic regimen.
At the time of this dictation, the patient was on cefepime, Flagyl IV day number nine, vancomycin IV day number eight, vancomycin p.o.
Their recommendations included conservative medical management and holding tube feeds.
Tube feeds were started two days after; however, due to severe gastroparesis and ileus, the patient could not tolerate even a minimal amount of tube feedings.
On [**2131-11-1**], the patient was taken to Interventional Radiology and postpyloric Dobbhoff feeding tube was placed.
On [**2131-11-2**], tube feeds were restarted at half strength at 10 cc an hour.
The patient was also maintained on TPN.
She was initially started on Diltiazem drip.
Subsequently, she required an Amiodarone drip times two and one attempt at cardioversion.
She was then started on Lopressor IV every four hours, Amiodarone drip as well as Diltiazem drip were discontinued.
She was successfully weaned off pressors during both episodes within 24 hours.
RENAL:  Status post kidney-renal transplant in [**2119**].
She received blood transfusions to maintain hematocrit above 28.
HEME:  Secondary to pancytopenia induced by chemotherapy, the patient required daily platelet transfusions and packed red blood cells every other day.
Her INR remained elevated despite vitamin K administration.
This was changed to a left internal jugular central line under the ultrasound guidance.
A right subclavian line was placed on [**2131-10-31**] and remained functional at the time of this dictation.
At the time of this dictation, a family meeting was planned for [**2131-11-5**] with the patient's oncologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], as well as the Intensive Care Unit attending to discuss the patient's prognosis and further treatment plans.
