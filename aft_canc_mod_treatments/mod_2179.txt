Pain was well controlled with an epidural.
The chest tube output itself totaled approximately 600 cc, but was quite serous in nature.
However, due to the hematocrit drop and the chest x-ray finding, it was not possible to rule out a possible intrapleural bleed.
Because of this, it was decided to take him to the operating room and perform a flexible bronchoscopy and right exploratory thoracoscopy.
On [**8-27**] he had his chest tube put to waterseal.
He slowly improved with numerous bronchs, aggressive chest physical therapy, nebulizer treatment, aggressive diuresis and ambulation.
On [**8-28**], he did not tolerate his bronchoscopy so he was transferred to the CSRU due to broncho-spasm.
His chest tube was taken out on [**8-29**] and his bulb was put to suction.
He failed three voiding trials but each time it seemed to be due to low urine in his bladder rather than a functional problem so on the day of discharge his bladder was infused with saline and then his foley was taken out.
Also on the days leading up to discharge he was able to cough up his mucus plugs with the help of aggressive chest physical therapy and ambulation.
