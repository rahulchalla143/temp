History of Present Illness: 63 year-old man with a history significant for stage IIIA NSCLC (dx [**11-24**]) s/p right pneumonectomy ([**6-25**]), presented to the ED with increasing productive cough and dyspnea over several days.
After his pneumonectomy he was as low as 140 lbs, and has fluctuated between 140-150 lbs for the last several weeks.
He was given a 2-week course of Levaquin (started [**11-9**]) due to concern for superimposed bronchitis.
During his [**6-25**] hospitalization, sputum cultures grew MRSA and he was treated with Vancomycin and later transitioned to Linezolid on discharge for a total of a 10-day course.
He was taking OxyContin 10mg [**Hospital1 **] and an occasional oxycodone with decent relief of his right-sided chest pain/pain with swallowing.
He had two cycles of induction chemotherapy w/ Carboplatin and Taxol (initiated [**2172-12-22**]) followed by concurrent XRT with Taxotere chemotherapy (initiated [**2173-2-2**]).
He was scheduled to undergo surgical resection on [**4-25**], but it was deferred secondary to SBO/LOA.
Pneumonectomy performed on [**6-25**] w/ radical mediastinal lymph node dissection and a muscle flap.
2) SBO s/p emergent exploratory laparotomy ([**4-25**]).
1+ AR, 1+ MR.  5) Hemorrhoids and anal fissure s/p lateral sphincterotomy ([**11-24**]).

CXR [**12-6**] (PA and lat): Status post right pneumonectomy.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 year-old man with a history significant for stage IIIA NSCLC (dx [**11-24**]) s/p right pneumonectomy ([**6-25**]), presented to the ED with increasing productive cough and dyspnea over several days.
An ABG after NRB placed was 7.28/55/469, w/ lactate 1.4.
Cetriaxone and Azithromycin were started for presumed acute-on-chronic bronchitis and/or CAP.
Predisone was started for bronchitis/COPD exacerbation.
An esmolol drip was started to decrease BP and HR.
He was placed on a Nitro gtt for concern for acute ischemia causing CHF.
He also received 20mg Lasix for a possible element of CHF.
His O2sats improved and he was transfered to the floors on nasal cannula.
Symptomatically he was no longer SOB, but continued to cough and produce thick white/yellow sputum.
On the floor ([**Date range (1) 31208**]): --Respiratory Distress: Several etiologies were considered, including acute-on-chronic bronchitis, CAP vs. aspiration PNA, COPD exacerbation, and CHF.
Acute-on-chronic bronchitis was believed to be the most likely etiology.
CAP and aspiration pneumonia were also of consideration (especially given the patient's recent history of pain and coughing with swallowing).
Ceftriaxone was discontinued, and Azithromycin continued to complete a 3 day course for acute bronchitis.
He was also started on Prednisone 60mg as well as nebulizers for this acute on chronic bronchitis flare.
By [**12-6**] he no longer required supplemental oxygen.
He continued to cough and produce white/yellow sputum, which he and his wife said was his baseline.
--Cardiovascular: CHF, possibly caused by acute ischemia or infection in the setting of already depressed cardiac function ([**6-25**] estimated EF 35%), was also a consideration for the patient's shortness of breath.
His blood pressure was controlled with Metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] while in the hospital.
He was discharged on his home dose of Toprol XL 100mg daily.
Lisinopril 2.5mg daily was added during this hospitalization due to his systolic dysfunction (he was discharged on this medication after his previous hospitalization in [**6-25**], but according to the patient was not taking it on admission).
He was discharged on Lisinopril 2.5mg daily.
Will ask the primary medical providers about the utlitiy of starting a statin or Aspirin in this patient.
--Right-Sided Chest Pain/Pain with Swallowing: The patient has had this pain since his pneumonectomy.
He has decent relief with his home regimen of pain medications (Oxycontin and Oxycodone) which were continued while he was in the hospital.
Anemia likely caused by his chemotherapy treatment.
The patient has poor appetite and recent weight loss, so folate and vitamin B12 level were checked.
His vitamin B12 was slightly low, so he was given parenteral B12 while in house, and discharged on B12 supplementation 1000 mcg daily.
He was on an Insulin sliding scale in the hospital and will suggest outpatient follow-up of his glucose levels.
