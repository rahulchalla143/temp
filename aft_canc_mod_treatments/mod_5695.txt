She received Cefepime on arrival for presumed febrile neutropenia, but ANC was actually 1500.
Pt had returned from radiology and had undergone a stool guaic with plan for heparin gtt when her son called out for help.
Pt was started on Amiodarone, given another 1mg epi.
Amiodarone was stopped and BP improved to the 100-110 range.

Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC Hx: diagnosed with right breast cancer in [**2139**] for which she underwent lumpectomy with axillary dissection and radiation therapy followed by 5 years of tamoxifen.
A right total mastectomy was performed on [**2148-12-27**], with pathology revealing a 3 cm tumor, grade II, with LVI, ER+ and HER2- by immunoperoxidase staining.
She then began adjuvant therapy with letrozole.
She was treated with zoledronic acid and fulvestrant followed by 15 months of liposomal doxorubicin, after which she was noted to have a rise in her CEA and CA 27.29 tumor markers and increased bony pain.
She began treatment with capecitabine monotherapy in [**6-28**] and has since remained clinically stable on this regimen, with an excellent performance status.
Of note, however, her most recent CT scan of the torso, obtained on [**2155-6-18**], demonstrated multiple new liver lesions and enlargement of the prior hepatic metastasis, involvement of multiple new foci in the skeleton with multiple new lytic and sclerotic lesions, and multiple new pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal nodes.
She received capecitabine throughout [**2155**], and is now s/p 4 cycles of navelbine, most recently in late [**2156-12-23**].
