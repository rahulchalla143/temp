Admission Date:  [**2152-4-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2152-4-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-1-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Amphotericin B / Ambisome / Campath  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: 40 yo with cml s/p transplant complicated by GVHD presents with worsening sob.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p pericardial effusion drainage   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 40 yo male with a h/o CML s/p MUD (CMV+/+) BMT in [**2147**], complicated by chronic graft versus host disease of the skin, lung and liver, in addition to chronic thrombocytopenia.
He is currenlty on Prednisone tx for his severe GVHD of the skin.
He has been on high doses of steroids and other therapies for his pulmonary condition.
Nasal fluid sample confirmed influenza and he was started on tamiflu.
Also of note he was diagnosed with right subclavian dvt recently and was started on lovenox which he self d/c'ed 10 days ago because it was causing him pain.
He was evaluated in ER where he was noted to have a mod-severe size pericardial effusion on non contrast CT. Pt was given a full dose lovenox for dvt/pe and admitted for further evaluation.
GVHD--symptoms have included severe skin findings, thrombocytopenia requiring transfusions, bronchiolitis obliterans and mouth sores.
treatment options are limited, since the patient has also had HUS to calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine, FK 506, no response to rapamycin, has had multiple trials of Rituxan as well as trial of endostatin all without signficant improvement.
He unfortunately has had multiple prior therapies including Rituxan, pentostatin, Campath, steroids, and CellCept.
He has had a significant issue as in the past with cyclosporin and FK-506.
portacath in place #.
Scabbed lesions noted on scalp and face.
Thickening of the skin of his neck, upper chest, back, and arms with hyperpigmentation changes and discoloration his arms, back, and upper chest.
This may be due to an acute infectious pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion given clinical suspicion for infection.
His hospital course was complicated by pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology s/p drainage of effusion in the CCU, respiratory distress from Tamiflu resistant influenza and superimposed bacterial PNA requiring ICU admission.
As an outpatient, he was started on Levofloxacin and Tamiflu for a 2 week course.
He was put on Cefepime, Vanc, Azithromycin and Flagyl but his respiratory status continued to worsen with persistent fever spikes.
He was started on Amantidine in the ICU for a brief period until Rimantidine could be obtained (the patient did not experience any neurologic side effects while on Amantidine).
His antibiotics were broadened to include Zosyn, Ceftazidime, Posaconazole, Azithromycin and Vancomycin.
In the ICU, the patient required NRB with persistent desaturations with any type of motion or exertion.
He transiently required Bipap when he began to tire but was never intubated.
Because of falling platelets down to as low as 63, the patient was switched from Zosyn to Meropenem which was thought to have less thrombocytopenic effects.
After > 10 days of antibiotics, the patient was on room air at rest and his antibiotics were discontinued.
He was observed for 3-4 days off antibiotics without fevers or increased oxygen requirement at which time he was discharged home with close followup.
#Influenza: The patient was started on Tamiflu for influenza and completed 14 days of Tamiflu.
The patient was tested for Tamiflu resistant influenza and this was confirmed.
# New atrial fibrillation/flutter: After the patient's pericardial effusion was drained and the drain removed, he was found to be in rapid afib/flutter.
He was put on Diltiazem for a brief period and converted back to sinus rhythm shortly afterwards.
His Diltiazem was stopped as it was thought that his atrial fib/fluter was an isolated event in the setting of pericardial irritation from the drain.
He was given IV diltiazem which slowed his rate, and then restarted on PO Dilt.
Additionally, the patient was started on Metoprolol to further slow his rate.
# Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelets began to trend down during his hospital course.
This was thought to be [**3-10**] the multiple antibiotics the patient had been on during his hospital course including Zosyn and Meropenem.
His platelets were as low as 63 while on multiple antibiotics but began to rise slowly 2-3 days after all antibiotics were stopped.
The patient was discharged on prednisone 40mg qd.
His platelets declined this admission from around 200 upon admission to as low as 63, but this was thought to be secondary to the multiple antibiotics the patient was put on for his bacterial pneumonia.
Additionally, he was put on long acting Diltiazem for atrial flutter.
Patient chose not to continue Lovenox injections as an outpatient because he did not see improvement in the RUE edema.
