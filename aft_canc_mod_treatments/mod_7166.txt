Various consistencies of barium were administered by mouth including thin, nectar, honey, ground, and puree.
Brief Hospital Course: 85M with a pmh of bronchiectasis, HTN, a-fib (on warfarin), s/p CVA, and neurofibromatosis who presents with hypoxia and tachypnea requiring NRB for ventilation and ICU stay through [**2-12**] for hypoxemia.
He was treated on an 8-day course of vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin.
PEG tube was initially tried by IR, but this was unsuccessful as they did not have an adequate window, as bowel was overlying his stomach.
GI did successfully place the PEG tube on [**2140-2-19**].
He was then started on tube feeds successfully.
On Coumadin at rehab, however, supratherapeutic INR of 3.5 on admission.
Also received antibiotics in the ED which could have caused further interaction with coumadin and elevation in INR.
Coumadin was held and INR monitored - goal INR = 2.0 - 3.0.
Restarted coumadin on [**2140-2-12**], which was then held on [**2140-2-16**] as PEG tube placement was pursued.
He was restarted on low-dose coumadin on [**2140-2-20**], and this may be titrated for goal INR [**1-7**].
He was therefore maintained on a condom cath.
However, he may be considered for a bladder scan for possible urinary retention with overflow; if he does have retention, you may consider flomax.
