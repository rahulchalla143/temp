Initially presented with leukocytosis with bandemia, severe pain, and positive blood culture for gram negative rods, on IV zosyn and aggressively hydrated.
Made NPO with bowel rest and TPN intially.
Following NJ tube placement by IR, started tube feeds (which she did not tolerate at the time).
GI, ID, and surgery were consulted.
Placed on dilaudid PCA.
Switched to cefipime and covered empirically for C. Diff for a few days on Po Vanc and IV Flagyl which were later discontinued after C. Diff PCR returned negative.
TPN was initiated on [**10-1**] and PICC was placed on [**10-2**].
The patient did not tolerate tube feeds once they were advanced on [**9-10**] and they were again stopped.
She remained on TPN for nutrition at this time.
Tube feeds were never restarted.
[**10-8**] pt's symptoms improved.Pt was started on clears [**10-10**] and her diet was successfully advanced to a BRAT diet on [**10-11**].
A PICC line was placed and the plan was to start TPN.
She triggered on [**10-15**] with Temp of 102, worsening abdominal discomfort, increased respiratory distress.
There was concern for C.diff given that pt had diarrhea on the onset of antibiotics and she started on PO vanco in addition to IV Flagyl.
She was placed on PPN given that her PICC was removed.
A PICC line was re-inserted on that date and TPN restarted.
She was taking in small amounts of oral liquids.
They recommended advancing diet as tolerated (avoiding high-fat foods), and follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 908**] of Gastroenterology in his clinic within the next 2 weeks (they are working on an appointment - the phone number for the GI division is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 463**]).
Pt initially on zosyn and later transitioned to cefepime (when WBC increased to 28K, later attributed to pancreatitis and not bactermia).
Patient completed a course of cefepime on [**10-6**].
She was put on Zosyn for this for a planned 2 week course ([**10-13**] - [**10-27**]).
PICC line was replaced [**10-17**].
After transfer back to the floor, the pt was placed on Tigecycline for better coverage of her C. diff in the setting of a rising WBC (up to 35K) despite PO/PR Vanco and IV Flagyl.
Total of 2 week of course of Tigecycline was completed on [**2104-10-27**].
treated with PO and PR Vancomyinc as well as IV TIgecycline.
She will complete PO Vancomycin 500 mg q6h on [**2104-11-4**].
She responded well to fluid resuscitation and her creatinine rapidly corrected.
# Metabolic Encephalopathy: Pt presented A0x3 and became confused and agitated on [**9-4**] with hallucinations of her cousin in the room, and although orientated largely to time, person and place, became agitated and pulled out her picc line and ng tube.
# Respiratory distress: This evolved initially following aggressive fluid resuscitation.
Pt was started on vancomycin (and zosyn) to cover for HCAP, but these were discontinued after one day given her rapid clinical improvement following diuresis with furosemide.
# Hypertension: held home bp medications initially due to concerns for SIRS/spesis.
Her hypertension was controlled initially with labetalol, and then with PO metoprolol.
When made NPO the pt was transitioned to IV Metoprolol around the clock.
When able to take PO, IV was discontinued and pt was started on diltiazem 30mg QID (equivalent to her home dose of 120mg daily).
When unable to take PO again, she was started on metoprolol IV QID.
This is considered to be a provoked event and 3-6 months of anticoagulation would be recommended.
Pt was started on IV heparin without an initial bolus.
