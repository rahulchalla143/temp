Admission Date:  [**2147-2-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2147-3-14**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with a left brain tumor seen on CT scan today.
The patient loaded with Dilantin and given 10 mg of Decadron.
He was started on Dilantin 100 mg three times a day and Decadron 8 mg q6hours for the edema.
Early on while in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient became delirious and concern of ethanol withdrawal was addressed.
The patient was given Thiamine and Folate as well as Ativan p.r.n.
The patient's operative procedure was initially delayed because there was concern the patient may have severe heart disease and arterial disease.
The patient was seen by Cardiology but in the end, angiography and further intervention was held due to the feeling that the meningioma that the patient had was more important.
As the patient's surgical procedure approached, the patient had an acute myocardial infarction, being ruled in with cardiac enzymes, which put off his surgery for some time while the patient was treated and allowed to improve post myocardial infarction.
It was the impression of the neurosurgical team to transfer the patient to the floor post myocardial infarction for a period of convalescence until such time that he was able to go to surgery.
The patient was started on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin.
He also had a catheter tip with fifteen colonies of bacteria growing.
His antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin and Ceftazidime.
The patient remains in the Intensive Care Unit while on antibiotics and allowed to improve over time with regards to his myocardial infarction and pneumonia.
Finally on [**2147-3-2**], the patient went to the operating room where the left frontotemporal craniotomy was performed and resection of his meningioma was accomplished.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was returned to the Intensive Care Unit postoperatively.
He is receiving physical therapy and is being screened for rehabilitation and the patient will likely go to a rehabilitation facility.
Decision was to be made whether or not to give him a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube prior to discharge.
The patient was treated with Diltiazem drip and finally with Amiodarone 800 mg once daily times one week, 400 mg once daily times two months and 200 mg once daily thereafter.
