Bone scan showed multiple lytic metastases to Lspine and Tspine as well as large lytic lesions in superior and midshaft L femur, concerning for potential for future pathologic fracture.
Thoracic surgery and Interventional Radiology were consulted and recommended a staged biopsy approach.

Colchicine was held upon admission and steroids were tapered 10mg daily for 2 days then 5mg for 1 day, then stopped.
TRANSITIONS OF CARE: -pt will f/u with thoracic-onc, thoracic surgery, ortho-onc, and his PCP.
