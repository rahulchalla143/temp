Pertinent details, by systems:  Neuro:  He was initially sedated post-liver transplant with a combination of fentanyl, versed and propofol.
These medications were ultimately weaned though required in varying doses to keep him comfortable on the ventilator.
His pain control was initially managed with fentanyl, then morphine, then oxycodone/tylenol when tolerating POs.
He ultimately cleared when weaned from the sedation and narcotics.
On the floor, he quickly returned to AAOx3 and used minimal narcotics, his pain regimen consisting of acetaminophen and oxycodone 2.5 mg Q4H PRN.
CV:  He was weaned off his pressors on POD 1.
He was otherwise hemodynamically stable, though he intermittently required levophed during the initial half of his ICU course while he was receiving plasmapheresis and CRRT.
During the latter days in the ICU, his pressures were strong enough off of pressors to allow him to tolerate HD instead of CRRT.
Anti-coagulation or any other invasive procedures.
He was placed on ASA and Plavix.
post-splenectomy thrombocytosis (900K)  Resp: His ICU course was characterized by multiple failed extubations.
However, he quickly reaccumulated secretions and CXR demonstrated collapsed lungs.
His blood type was O. Splenectomy was done for this reason to decrease antibodies against donor.
Post splenectomy vaccines were administered on [**7-16**] (Haemophilus and pneumococcal) and Meningococcal (Menactra)on [**7-17**].
JP drains ( in hilar area and posterior to liver) were removed as non bilious drainage diminished.
The splenectomy resection bed JP was left in place.
On [**7-7**], a liver duplex was done for decrease in HCT.
Adjacent collection was increased to 12 cm.
On [**7-10**], under CT guidance, a 12 Fr pigtail drain was placed in LUQ near splenic bed.
He continued on broad spectrum antibiotics.
This pigtail drain output average 70 - 120 cc each day and continued to be bloody.
The drain will remain in place upon discharge  He required hemodialysis 3 times a week via left chest tunnelled catheter.
He tolerated dialysis well.
Hemodialysis was done on [**7-14**] after tunnelled line was replaced (on Left, IJ).
Dialysis was held on [**7-16**] given [**Month/Year (2) **] output increase to 1100 cc per day.
EKG was unchanged and Kayexalate was administered with potassium decrease to 5.4.
Two gram potassium diet was ordered and tube feeds were switched to Nepro.
Given insufficient calorie intake, a post pyloric feeding tube had been placed and tube feeds were started.
Given h/o left leg bypass graft infection, he was continued on preop med, Dicloxacillin for prophylactic suppression coverage.
Prior to this had been covered by Vancomycin x 17 days.
He also received Zosyn x 7 days while in ICU to cover presumed pneumonia.
