DISCHARGE LABS:  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 100868**] is a 72 year old female with history of primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, who presented with hyponatremia and acute renal failure in the setting of volume overload.
She was started on milrinone continuous infusion; CO increased to 3.1 from 2.9, f/u ECHO did not show significant change but her symptoms improved.
When hypertonic saline was stopped, Na drifted back down.
Since we felt her hyponatremia was due to heart failure and poor renal perfusion, she was managed with milrinone as below as well as salt tabs.
Had continued with hypervolemia symptoms and weight gain despite spironolactone 25 mg daily and torsemide 80 mg daily at home.
Thus, she was started on milrinone continuous infusion at 0.5 mcg/kg/min.
She was also continued on torsemide 80mg then 60mg, spironolactone was held for hyperkalemia.
Metoprolol was also held, but then it was restarted at her home dose before she was discharged.
She is no longer on ACE inhibitors because of her renal function and because her heart remodeling is considered complete.
With addition of milrinone, her Cr improved from 3.1 on [**Last Name (un) **] to 2.0  # atrial fibrillation (Afib): Chronic afib status post ICD and now constantly v-paced.
She was continued on metoprolol for rate control and amiodarone for rhythm control.
However, her warfarin was discontinued because her annual stroke risk is low compared to life expectancy with a CHADS2 score of 1.

You underwent a cardiac catheterization which showed that your heart pump was weak and improved with a new medication, called milrinone.
You were started on continuous infusion of milrinone and your kidneys and sodium improved.
- STOP taking warfarin and spironolactone  You should also keep all the follow-up appointments listed below.
It is important to bring your medications to each appointment so your doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] adjust the doses as needed.
