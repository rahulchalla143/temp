History of Present Illness: The patient is a 52-year-old woman who presented in [**2196-12-14**] with pain in her hip and was found to have a pathologic fracture of her acetabulum with a large soft tissue mass in her pelvis in the abductor area with signal abnormality in her entire ilium including both superior and inferior pubic rami and ischium.
She was treated with preoperative chemotherapy initially with Adriamycin and Ifosfamide and subsequently with Adriamycin and cisplatin with minimal clinical or radiographic response.
I had a lengthy discussion with her and her husband about alternatives to treatment which included formal external hemipelvectomy or an internal hemipelvisectomy with an attempt to save her limb.
There was some concern about involvement of the sciatic nerve, and she had had prior pelvic radiation for uterine carcinoma.
She was also aware of the magnitude of the surgery with the potential loss of function of the limb of loss of her life but that it maximized the chance of her survival in the long term compared to radiotherapy.
