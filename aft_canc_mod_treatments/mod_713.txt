This induction was carried out to accommodate the patient's planned chemotherapy for invasive breast cancer diagnosed at 22wks, s/p L mastectomy and L axillary dissection, and chemotherapy x2 cycles ([**2177-6-12**] and [**2177-7-3**]).
Following this the patient had a favorable cervix and was started on Pitocin.
15 minutes following delivery, the patient had further vaginal bleeding.
The tone improved with bimanual massage as well as 1 dose of Methergine and 40 units of Pitocin.
At this point in time, the patient was typed and screened and remained on labor and delivery for further monitoring.
In light of the persistence of this postpartum hemorrhage with intermittent atony, the patient was recommended for dilation and curettage as well as exam under anesthesia to rule out retained products of conception.
The details of the operative procedure are found in the operative report elsewhere.
During the procedure, as the patient continued to have some uterine atony, she was given a dose of Methergine and 2 doses of Hemabate.
Following suction, the external genitalia was inspected and the first degree periurethral laceration appeared intact.
Following this procedure, as the patient continued to have a small amount of bleeding, she received a further dose of 1000 mcg of Cytotec.
Having exhausted medical management of postpartum hemorrhage options, an emergent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed to further control bleeding.
Blood products infused at the time of surgery were 7units PRBC, 1 unit PLT, 2 FFPs, 1unit cryo.
The details of this procedure is found in detail in the operative report elsewhere.
The pt remained intubated and was transferred to the intensive care unit for management on POD#0.
CK and troponin were found elevated.
Pt was weaned off vent, and hypotension, likely secondary to PPH, resolved with 3units of additional PRBC in the ICU over POD#0-2.
Pt continued to do well without complications on the floor with routine postop/postpartum care.
