You were also started on bacitracin/polymyxin ointment for a right-eye conjunctivitis.
Cr increased despite octreotide, midodrine and pt became volume overloaded, leading to need for dialysis.
Dialysis was initiated and pt's MS improved to baseline indicating uremia was likely contributing to AMS.
However around the same time pt was also started on lactulose, so could have had a level of HE.
Hypercarbia appears to be somewhat chronic in nature given pH of 7.34 and pCO2 of 54 (if acute change, would expect pH of 7.28 or so).
He was admitted to MICU for worsening respiratory distress, given his anasarca pulmonary edema was the focared diagnosis, though aspiration pneumonitis and PNA were also considered.
He was treated with Vancomycin/Zosyn empirically and he received bedside hemodialysis to remove excess fluid.
In MICU his repiratory status improved with HD, empiric therapy and patient began auto-diuresing.
Also, was off of lasix and spironolactone since prior discharge on [**8-30**] and was just restarted on [**9-16**] (40 mg IV) and [**9-18**] (60 mg) w/ poor response.
Has become oliguric in response to recent lasix challenges.
Per hepatology consult on the day of ICU transfer, patient appears to have hepatorenal syndrome, so he was given albumin 25 q8h and diuresis was held.
He received albumin before arriving to MICU and in MICU was started on midodrine/ocreotide for possible hepatorenal syndome.
Hepatology and renal followed in MICU and he received bedside HD.
Anasarca resolved and pt's creatine improved to 1.8 on discharge.
Gave albumin and held diuresis in the setting of likely hepatorenal syndrome.
As above, he was started on midodrine and octreotide in MICU in addition to, HD line placed by IR and bedside HD initiated.
Tunneled line was placed and used for UF as above.

You were started on antibiotics and slowly responded to this.
Your eye was also found to have an infection (conjunctivitis), so you were given an antibiotic eye ointment.
We treated you with IV antibiotics and your pneumonia improved.
Your kidney function improved after dialysis, so we started you on a different type of dialysis called ultra-filtration.
We have made the following changes to your home medications: STOP: hydralazine STOP: gabapentin CHANGE: lasix from 40mg daily to 40mg twice daily CHANGE: insulin sliding scale START: Metolozone 2.5 mg daily START: potassium chloride 40meq twice daily  Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
