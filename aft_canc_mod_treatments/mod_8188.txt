Though ischemia is most common etiology of VT, this patient's VT was more likely due to flecainide toxicity, especially considering possible interaction between flecainide and ciprofloxacin.

Discharge Instructions: Mrs. [**Known lastname 87311**], you were admitted to [**Hospital1 827**] after presenting with complaints of leg pain, fatigue and night sweats.
You were found to have an abnormal heart rhythm which we believe was due to the combination of medications that you were on that interact and can cause an abnormal heart rhythm.
We discontinued [**Name2 (NI) 112494**] and gave you intravenous fluids to help wash this medication out of your system.
We started two new medications for your atrial fibrillation called Metoprolol and Verapamil.
We did not perform a cardioversion to "shock" your heart back into a normal rhythm because this would require you to be on blood thinners which would have prevented you from being able to have a biopsy while you were in the hospital.
We will schedule you to see the Electrophysiology doctors as [**Name5 (PTitle) **] outpatient where a cardioversion can be performed as deemed necessary.
