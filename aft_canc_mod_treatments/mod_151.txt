If there is continued clinical concern, a repeat study preferably with sedation can help.
I would strongly urge conventional chest radiographs and if serious questions of abnormality remain clarification by a chest CT scan, if that is justified clinically.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 52 yo man with h/o CAD, HTN, A-FIB (Coumadin) who presented with back pain, found to have MSSA bacteremia and epidural abscess s/p drainage, with a hospital course complicated by Acute Renal Failure and hospital-acquired pneumonia, which both improved prior to discharge.
Patient underwent OR drainage of the abcess by ortho spine.
At the time of diagnosis with hospital-acquired pneumonia, the patient was transitioned to Vancomycin and Cefepime, but was transitioned back to nafcillin and later cefazolin for ongoing treatment of his epidural space infection.
The patient initially required q4h neuro checks given risk of epidural hematoma formation, and required medical ICU coverage earlier in his hospital course.
After he completed his course of IV vancomycin and cefepime the patient was transitioned back to nafcillin.
He is being followed with the infectious disease specialists and they will monitor him for the length of his antibiotic coverage.
Once the blood cultures were noted to be positive at OSH for MSSA, the patient was started on nafcillin.
He was subsequently treated with vancomycin/cefepime before thansitioning to nafcillin again and then to cefazolin as noted above.
Arthrocentesis did not reveal  clear evidence of  joint space involvement.
Per ID, the patient will require a [**5-3**] week course of antibiotics.
Colchicine was held given worsening renal function.
prednisone 60 mg of p.o.
The patient will be sent out on prednisone with a taper until his symptoms improve.
# Afib with RVR: Started on po dilt at OSH after initiation of dilt gtt for afib w/ RVR.
His dilt gtt was increased to 20 mcg/hr without adequate control of his heart rate.
Amiodarone was then stopped, metoprolol boluses were initiated and dilt gtt was weaned.
On transfer to the floor pt was well controlled on metoprolol 10 mg q6h IV.
The patient was continued on a heparin drip as her main subtherapeutic from his warfarin.
The patient will be sent to his rehabilitation facility with a heparin drip as he is transitioned to a therapeutic level on his current warfarin dosing.
#ARF:  Pt's creatinine increased to 4.3 from a baseline of 1.0.
This was thought to be from a pre-renal etiology as the pt was diuresed with IV lasix upon presentation to the MICU.
In addition, he had nearly a 5-6 L NG tube output once an NGT was placed.
The nafcillin was discontinued and he was transitioned to cefazolin.
While there was concern for the potentialcross-reactivity with the cefazolin, the type of hypersensitivity reaction, as well as the desire to maintain a bacteriacidal [**Doctor Last Name 360**] led the team to continue with cefazolin with planned careful monitoring.
An NGT was placed and 5-6 L of output was immediately seen.
Pt was kept NPO until he was able to pass flatus and have BM.
The patient initiated a course of IV vancomycin and cefepime for total 7 days.
The patient's oxygen requirements were weaned quickly and at the time of his transfer to the medicine floor from the MICU the patient no longer required supplemental oxygen.
#Anemia: Postoperatively the patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells.
The patient was transfused and additional unit of packed red blood cells.
#Delirium: Patient had an episode of delirium on the medical ICU and required intramuscular Haldol.
His opiate analgesics were weaned and the patient's sensorium cleared.
If so consider cefazolin as the source.
