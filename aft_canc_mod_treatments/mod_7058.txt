HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung with diffuse metastases to the liver, pelvis, and brain (status post carboplatin and Taxol radiation therapy 'Arissa') who was found to have brain metastases (status post resection) in [**2175-2-14**] who had been recently started on Navelbine salvage who presented on [**2175-4-10**] with hypotension, mild disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute renal failure, and supraventricular tachycardia.
She was treated broadly with ampicillin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl and was admitted to the Feniard Intensive Care Unit.
Multiple nebulizer treatment were tried without affect.
The patient was given Benadryl 25 mg p.o.
times two and Cogentin 2 mg times two for suspected laryngeal dystonia from Haldol.
The patient was given Pepcid 20 mg intravenously times one and dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously for a potential allergic reaction with no improvement.
Poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma diagnosed in [**2173-4-16**] with three right upper lobe lesions; treated with Taxol and carboplatin.
She was given radiation therapy and then Arissa.
In [**2175-1-14**], she was found to have brain metastases and underwent right frontal lobe resection with two smaller metastases remaining in [**2175-2-14**].
The patient was started on Navelbine salvage.
Right thyroidectomy for colloid nodule.
Haldol 0.5 mg p.o.
Dapsone 4 mg intravenously twice per day.
Iron 325 mg p.o.
Vitamin K 10 mg p.o.
Docusate 100 mg p.o.
Senna one tablet p.o.
Lactulose 30 cc p.o.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Brain cancer, thyroid cancer, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and asthma.
IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of poorly differentiated lung cancer with diffuse metastases to the liver, pelvis, and brain; status post carboplatin, Taxol, radiation therapy, Arissa, and metastases resection (on Navelbine salvage) who presented with hypotension, mild disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute renal failure, and lactic acidosis who now returned to the Feniard Intensive Care Unit with acute respiratory distress.
The differential diagnosis initially included a dystonic reaction from Haldol or an allergic reaction.
She was not any more responsive on [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure and required morphine for some sedation to enable her to work with the [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure.
CODE ISSUES:  The patient presented with progressive lung cancer diffusely metastatic which was refractory to multiple chemotherapeutic regimens, brain metastases resection, and radiation therapy.
She developed worsening respiratory failure in the setting of progressive lactic acidosis, pleural effusions, respiratory acidosis, and altered mental status.
