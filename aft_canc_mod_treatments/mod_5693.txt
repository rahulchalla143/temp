Admission Date:  [**2130-3-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2130-5-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2074-9-17**]       Sex:  F  Service:  Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old female with a past medical history significant for right lower quadrant mass suspicious for cancer, status post percutaneous drainage of the right lower quadrant mass in [**2129-12-16**].
She was to undergo surgery for the right lower quadrant mass on [**2130-2-5**]; however, after long discussions with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8488**], the patient decided to wait a few weeks to build up her strength before having surgery.
Status post an appendectomy.
Status post a cesarean section.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Dilantin, Prilosec, valproic acid, iron, multivitamin, Tylenol, and Dulcolax.
Chem-7 revealed sodium of 137, potassium 4.1, chloride 101, bicarbonate 22, BUN 11, creatinine 0.5, glucose 86.
Given the increase in the right colonic mass with possible reperforation, she was kept n.p.o., started on intravenous fluids and intravenous antibiotics (ceftriaxone, Flagyl, and ampicillin).
On [**4-13**], the patient underwent right hemicolectomy with ileotransverse colon anastomosis for presumed colon cancer.
She also underwent a cystoscopy and right ureteral stent placement by Urology.
Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit for postoperative management.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  On postoperative day one, the patient was started on total parenteral nutrition.
She received a right femoral line for this in the surgical intensive care unit.
and started on intravenous Zantac.
She also had a nasogastric tube placed at the time of surgery.
On postoperative day six, tube feeds were attempted; however, the patient developed diarrhea on the tube feeds, therefore they had to be discontinued.
The patient was maintained on total parenteral nutrition.
On postoperative day 11, a Speech and Swallow consultation was obtained for a bedside swallow evaluation.
Postoperatively, the patient had been receiving intravenous fluid hydration; however, that was hep-locked on postoperative day eight.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Postoperatively, given the macroperforation, the patient was started on a 10-day course of ceftriaxone, Flagyl, and ampicillin which she completed.
The PICC line was attempted to be placed; however, it was discovered that the patient had bilateral upper extremity deep venous thromboses as well as occlusion of the superior vena cava; therefore, the PICC lines had to be discontinued, and the patient received her antibiotics through peripheral IVs.
In addition, a urine cultures grew out greater than 100,000 colonies of enterococcus and greater than 100,000 colonies of coag-negative Staphylococcus.
The ceftriaxone and Flagyl were discontinued after two days given that the patient defervesced nicely, and there was a known source from the blood and the urine coag-negative Staphylococcus which the vancomycin would cover.
A 14-day course of the vancomycin was recommended.
On postoperative day 21, vancomycin day six, the patient was changed from vancomycin to linezolid per Infectious Disease recommendation for a total of nine more days.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient had received 2 units of packed red blood cells prior to her surgery.
In addition, she subsequently received several units of blood postoperatively.
As previously, a PICC line was attempted on postoperative day four.
They recommended systemic heparin with long-term Coumadin therapy.
Therefore, the patient was started on intravenous heparin until her Coumadin was in the therapeutic range.
The heparin was eventually changed to Lovenox while awaiting the Coumadin to become therapeutic.
Their recommendations were that the superior vena cava and subclavian brachiocephalic veins could be recannulized; although, it would be a lengthy procedure requiring bilateral arm and right groin approach.
The plan was if the superior vena cava syndrome symptoms persisted and/or central access was needed for central chemotherapy therapy, interventional radiology could recanalize.
This will need to be addressed as an outpatient if central chemotherapy was warranted.
They believed that the patient was at high risk for recurrence and recommended adjuvant chemotherapy four to six weeks postoperatively.
A discussion was held with the patient and her family members regarding 5-[**Name2 (NI) **] and leucovorin.
Neurology was consulted on postoperative day seven because the patient had been refusing her Dilantin, and her Dilantin level was extremely low.
They had a long discussion with the patient regarding the risks and benefit of her seizure medication and informed her that her risks for further seizure and possibly status epilepticus was high.
Therefore, she was started on phosphophenytoin.
Her heparin was stopped at this time and Neurology was called.
POSTOPERATIVE ISSUES:  The patient's pain was controlled with a morphine PCA well.
she was converted to Percocet for the pain which provided adequate pain relief.
The patient had retention sutures and staples of her incision.
Therefore, her right groin line was her primary intravenous central access for approximately two weeks.
Once the right groin line was discontinued the patient had peripheral IVs for intravenous access.
Intravenous access will need to be addressed if the patient does require central chemotherapy because of the bilateral upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Status post right hemicolectomy.
Status post methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coag-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia.
Coumadin 7.5 mg p.o.
Linezolid 600 mg p.o.
Dilantin 300 mg p.o.
Multivitamin 1 tablet p.o.
