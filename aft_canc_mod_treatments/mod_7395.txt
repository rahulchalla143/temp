HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 4334**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] Medicine Service on [**2117-3-5**] for primary work-up and treatment of a left femur fracture status post a mechanical fall.
He was placed on Telemetry and there were no events on Telemetry noted.
He had a left open reduction and internal fixation of his femur performed on [**2117-3-9**], that was performed well without any complications.
The patient was noted to have a drop in his hematocrit from 36 to 29 in the setting of the operation which was felt secondary to blood loss during the operation.
He received two units of blood and his hematocrit responded appropriately.
The recommendations of the Orthopedic Team is to continue Coumadin for six months with a goal INR of 1.5 to 2.0 for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.
He was seen by Physical Therapy who recommended rehabilitation and the patient will be transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for extensive rehabilitation after discharge from the hospital.
He was given multiple fluid boluses without significant response of his blood pressure and required higher levels of oxygen and was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
The patient was monitored in the Medical Intensive Care Unit overnight in which he was given intravenous antibiotics consisting of Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
It was thought to be evidence of aspiration pneumonia and he was continued on Levofloxacin and Flagyl times seven days.
At the time of his hospital discharge, he is requiring very minimal amounts of oxygen and to complete a course of Levofloxacin and Flagyl for a complete seven-day course.
This was noted to occur after he had his orthopedic surgery and it was felt best to treat this with a seven-day course of Vancomycin since the patient has hardware after surgery.
The patient was placed in Isolation and had the Foley changed and placed on the condom catheter.
He will continue his antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia and Vancomycin there and will acutely rehabilitate after his left femur fracture before being transferred home and resume care under his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
