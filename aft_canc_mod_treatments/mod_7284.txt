Apparently, his initial rhythm on EMS arrival was PEA, and he received 1 mg epinephrine and 1 mg atropine.
He also received 300 mg amiodarone but it is unclear whether this was given first or subsequent to other medications.
Right femoral CVL was placed for IV access.
He was placed on dopamine gtt with persistent hypotension and levophed was added.
He also required epinephrine gtt to maintain blood pressures in the 90s systolic.
He received IV ceftriaxone 1 g X 1 (but not vancomycin which was also ordered in the ED).
A left radial arterial line as placed.
On further questioning, the patient's wife notes that the patient has had a cough productive of sputum for the past few months; he has been treated intermittently with antibiotics for this.

From family history, the patient falls asleep frequently during the day, likely secondary to chronic hypercarbia in the setting of not using CPAP and exacerbated by patient multiple narcotic pain medications.
Other possibilities for PEA arrest, including MI, electrolyte abnormalities, PE, hypothermia were felt to be unlikely after further investigation.
He was rapidly weaned off of the pressors.
At the time of his discharge, medications which could adversely affect his respiratory status were discontinued or weaned down.
Specifically, his flexeril, seroquel and oxycodone were discontinued.
His oxycontin dose was decreased to 10mg by mouth three times daily.
He was instructed regarding the importance of wearing his CPAP machine as instructed, and the risks of a recurrent episode of PEA arrest should he not do so.
He also takes multiple narcotics and other sedating medications which could contribute to altered mental status and exacerbate hypoventilation.
Pulmonary was called to replace the endotracheal tube under bronchoscopic guidance because of the existing stent.
The ventilator settings were weaned and the patient was extubated on [**12-23**], sating well on 4L NC.
Sputum on [**12-20**] grew Coag + Staph aureus and the patient was treated with vancomycin and cefepime for and 8 day course.
The patient's oxygen requirement improved and he did not spike any additional fevers while on antibiotics or after they were stopped.
The patient also received aggressive fluid resuscitation on initial presentation.
He was diruesed with furosemide, and was eventually placed back on his home regimen of lasix 40mg po qdaily at the time of discharge.
Cr 2.7 on admission in setting of shock and arrest, improved with IVF and resuscitation and returned to [**Location 213**] range.
He was discharged home on his home regimen of lasix 40mg po qdaiy.
The patient continued to improve during his hospitalization, but memory remained sluggish at discharge, thoug hpt clearly understood his surroundings, his indication for hospitalization, treatment recommendations and instructions for follow-up.
He was placed on an insulin gtt and blood sugars were monitored q1h until they were under better control.
He was eventually transitioned back to Lantus to 20 [**Hospital1 **] with a sliding scale.
# Hypertension: The patient's home antihypertensive regimen was held on presentation given his pressor requirement.
He was gradually started back on metoprolol, ACE, isordil and furosemide.
# Chronic pain: On presentation all of the patient's chronic pain medications were stopped due to altered mental status.
Following transfer to the general medical floor, the patient was restarted on oxycodone 5 mg Q6H and gradually advanced to oxycontin 10 mg Q8H with prn oxycodone as above.
The patient was noted to be very somnolent on this regimen which included frequent prn oxycodone.
PRN oxycodone was stopped and the patient gradually became more alert.
On discharge he was advised to use a lower dose of oxycontin (10mg po tid) at home to prevent sedation and further respiratory difficulties.
These enzyme elevations resolved quickly and pt was restarted on his statin.
# h/o BPH - pt on ditropan and urecholine on admission.
his ditropan was held [**2-8**] concerns that anticholinergic effects could have contributed to his hypercarbic respiratory failure.
he is s/p pacemaker for unclear indication per his cardiologists note on [**2177-12-2**].
In [**2162**], his mechanical valve was switched to a bioprosthetic valve due to poorly controlled INRs.
He was on a heparin pump at some point, but this was complicated by heparin induced osteoporosis as well as infection.
he was clinically euvolemic at time of discharge, and discharged home on home regimen of lasix 40mg po qdaily.
discharge plan was also communicated by case management and physical therapy on day of discharge.
