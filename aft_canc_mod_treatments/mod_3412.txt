Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 47367**] is a 52 year old male with no major past medical history who presented with dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and easy bruisability, and was found to be pancytopenic.
The pt was started on cefepime.
His pericardial drain was removed the next day.
# pericardial effusion/tamponade:  As described above, ECHO showed these results.
He was intially given 7+3 idarubicin and cytarabine chemotherapy to induce remission with the plan to have a donor allo transplant.
He was reinduced with HIDAC on [**4-22**].
He was started on cefepime but developed a rash.
He was switched to aztreonam and continued to spike temps.
More antibiotics were added including vancomycin, levofloxacin and several different antifungals including caspofungin, micafungin, voriconazole, posaconazole, ambisome.
He had several reactions to these antifungals including rash (likely with caspofungin and micafungin) and elevated LFTs.
The antibiotics were pealed back and he was discharged on voriconazole alone (see details below).
He also developed mucositis which required morphine PCA and TPN for malnutrition.
On the day of discharge, he was told that a bone marrow donor was likely found.
He had two MRIs of the liver (one while still neutropenic and one after his counts recovered) to rule out obvious fungal infections in the liver; both were negative.

Differential included primary syphilis, lymphogranulosum venereum (although very rare), skin ulceration secondary to trauma and worsened by neutropenia.
He was treated with a course of ciprofloxacin and azithromycin and the ulcer healed.
# renal lesion: Incidentally found on chest CT initially and a renal ultrasound also could not characterize it will.
Radiology felt it might appear to be a papillary RCC, but recommended a renal MRI to fully evaluate.
