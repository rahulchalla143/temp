The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the  procedure.
An prosthetic  graft is seen in the proximal ascending aorta above the sinus of valsalva.
DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5785**]   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 5784**] was admitted and underwent aortic and mitral valve replacments, along with replacement of ascending aorta and excision of atrial myxoma.
He maintained stable hemodynamics and weaned from inotropic support.
Volume and intravenous fluids were administered while diuretics and beta-blockers were initially withheld.
He was started on Neosynephrine to maintain MAPs > 70 mmHg and renal perfusion.
Neosynephrine was gradually weaned without difficulty.
Diuretics and beta blockade were gradually resumed.
On postoperative day four, he transferred to the SDU for further care and recovery.
Despite remaining in a normal sinus rhythm(with first degree AV block)postoperatively, Warfarin anticoagulation was eventually resumed given his history of atrial fibrillation and myxoma resection.
He continued to make clinical improvements with diuresis and was eventually cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day 9.
