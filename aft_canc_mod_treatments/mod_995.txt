HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77 year old male with a stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer and asthma, who was requiring two liters of nasal cannula at home times one year, but started complaining of dyspnea and began to have an increased oxygen requirement, four liters.
Two days ago, he noticed four out of ten chest pressure times two minutes at rest and worse with activity.
He denies any fevers, chills, sweats, abdominal pain, dysuria, or tuberculosis exposure.
In the Emergency Room, the patient was started on a nonrebreather and then changed to BiPAP but he was changed back to a nonrebreather because he did not tolerate BIPAP.
Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted and a chest tube was placed.
Status post left nephrectomy and partial bladder removal for renal cell cancer 50 years ago.
Stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2160**], bilateral disease without extra-thoracic disease.
Patient is status post carboplatin and Navelbine times five which led to seizure-like activity.
The patient is also status post IRESSA times two months and Taxotere times five treatments from [**2164-11-13**].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Fentanyl patch 200 mcg q.72h., roxicodone one to two teaspoons 5 mg/5 ml p.r.n., Ambien 10 mg p.o.q.h.s.p.r.n., Hytrin 5 mg p.o.q.h.s., Flovent two puffs b.i.d., Ventolin two puffs q.4-6h.p.r.n., Cardizem 120 mg p.o.q.d., aspirin.
Pulmonary:  As already noted, the patient had a chest tube placed by cardiothoracic surgery.
The patient was transferred to the cardiothoracic surgery team for bleomycin pleurodesis.
He was requiring six liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.
The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.
The patient was continued on albuterol and Atrovent.
He was also continued on fluticasone.
On [**2165-5-1**], the patient finally received his bleomycin pleurodesis treatment.
At this point, the patient was started on Solu-Medrol, even though the patient was thought to be mucus plugging.
At this point, there was a decision to be made about whether or not to perform further pleurodesis, possibly with talc versus the placement of a portable valve such as a Heimlich valve.
The patient went home the following day with VNA services.
This was thought to be secondary to receiving Lasix for what was thought to be an exacerbation of congestive heart failure where, in fact, the patient was probably actually dry, with a metabolic contraction alkalosis.
He received Zyprexa at night.
He briefly was also receiving Ritalin and Celexa, although this was thought to be hurting rather than helping.
