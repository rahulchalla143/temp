She also underwent a tracheostomy and modified radical neck dissection.
A indwelling venous flow monitor was also placed along with neck drains during operation.
[**Name (NI) **] pt was admitted under sedation and on ventilator to SICU.
The flap was monitored manually via doppler and with an in-dwelling venous doppler line.
The donor site for the radial forearm flap was had a wound vac in place and the thigh skin graft site was dressed with nonadherent dressings.
During the days in the SICU pt was slowly weaned from ventilator and sedation and placed on humdified air.
A doboff tube was placed and feeds started.
OT was consulted and placed a volar-type split over the L arm to maintain support for the L arm/wound vac site.
At the point when pt was transferred from SICU to CC6 pt was awake, interactive, starting to move to sitting position with assistance from PT, on full tube feeds, drains in place holding suction with decreasing amounts of drianage, wound vac was taken down with nonadherent dressings applied to the radial donor site and pain well controlled.
Eventually IV meds changed over to PO and admin'd via doboff.
T/o course on CC6 wounds continued to heal, flap continued to mature, pt progressed in PT and received a dorsal blocking aplint to continue to maintain support for radial free flap donor site.
Of note, pt did pull her doboff tube out twice during time on CC6 which was replaced both times without problems with tube feeds restarted each time.
Tolerating tube feeds, pain well controlled, and ambulating.
