There, he had a leukocytosis to 18.4 with 58% neutrophils and 39% bands, creatinine 1.5, lactate of 3.9, and an anion gap of 15; he was also hypoxemic with a 3 L.min oxygen requirement.
There, he was started on empiric ampicillin/sulbactam and vancomycin for presumed cellulitis.
On [**2179-9-8**], he was fiberoptically intubated for mental status changes and also had transient atrial fibrillation controlled with digoxin and beta blockade; antibiotics were changes to penicillin and clindamycin.
He experienced post-operative hypotension requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressors.
Upon arrival, a right subclavian central line was placed for access.
He came off of norepinephrine late on the night of [**2179-9-10**].

## Respiratory failure: From [**9-9**] until [**9-20**], the patient developed a progressive leukocytosis and persistent fever with thick secretions despite treatment for VAP with clinda/vanc/zosyn.
Meropenem was added on [**9-20**] and the patient defervesced with regression of his leukocytosis.
He tolerated a trach collar on [**9-26**].
He was treated with 14 days of antibiotics targeted against his GAS including those indicated above: vanco, zosyn, and meropenem.
A tunnelled HD line was eventually placed with the suspicion that the patient may need longerm HD but the patient began to urinate copiously and the decision was made to stop HD and remove the tunnelled line on [**9-28**].
## Type 2 diabetes mellitus: The patient was markedly hyperglycemic requiring an insulin drip to maintain euglycemia.
## Hypertension: Patient's home medications were held as he was initially hypotensive and many of his home meds are renally metabolized.
His HTN was mildly responsive to fluid removal with HD but was thought mainly to be related to pain as his BP increased dramatically with any movement.
His pain was controlled with standing tylenol and a fentanyl patch along with tapering prn fentanyl boluses.
He was first restarted on beta-blockade with metoprolol which was titrated up to its current regimen of 75mg tid along with his home amlodipine 10mg daily.
## Compartment syndrome s/p fasciotomy: A wound care consult was placed and plastic surgery evaluated the fasciotomy sites for further management options.
Due to minimal granulation tissue, wound vac was continued with eventual plan for plastic surgery re-evaluation with possible skin grafting.
Restarted rosuvastatin 10mg on [**9-26**].
