Patient was given 3L NS, 1 gram IV vancomycin, and 750 mg PO levofloxacin, and sent to the MICU.
Started on ampicillin/sulbactam (unasyn) and continued on levofloxacin in the MICU.
Patient's procedure was c/b hypoventilation and PaCO2 noted at one point to be > than 100.
Mechanical ventilation/intubation in PACU lowered PaCO2 to ~ mid-50's and patient was extubated, then transferred to the floor (O2 saturation > 90%).
Progression of left upper lobe atelectasis and consolidation as above.
Status post recent debridement with gas in the area of the previously seen lesion and re-opening of the left upper lobe bronchus, as above.
After infectious work up was negative on multiple occassions, the fevers were attributed to his tumor and he was started on scheduled acetaminophen and continuous IVF.
The patient was started on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin in the ED but was switched to Ampicillin/Sulbactam in the MICU.
Interventional pulmonology performed a rigid bronchoscopy with bulk resection on [**10-21**].
Antibiotics were again switched to Levofloxacin and Metronidazole per ID's recommendations.
The patient subsequently began radiation therapy in an effort to shrink the tumor with hopes that this would be definitive therapy for the pneumonia.
The patient was again transitioned from Levofloxacin and Flagyl to Ampiclliin/Sulbactam.
Antibiotics were discontinued at discharge as the patient had completed over 20 days of antibiotics and there was little concern for infectious etiology of his fevers per above.

Thoracic surgery was consulted and performed a mediastinoscopy for which the sampled lymph nodes were negative for malignant cells.
