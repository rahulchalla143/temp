Right pleural tube extends across the right lower hemithorax, tip crossing the midline where it impinges on the mediastinum.
Esophageal stent in place.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted with a chest tube for a right hydropneumothorax and question of esophageal rupture.
The patient was kept NPO with IVF, and was treated with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole.
His course was complicated by the patient's initial wishes to leave AMA and his refusal of an a-line, central line, and PICC.
He did demonstrate some relief of his SOB upon draining the fluid from his pleural space, and requested that he be discharged with the chest tube in place.
On [**2186-9-18**], interventional radiology was not able to place a smaller drain because there was not enough fluid accumulation.
Hospice consulted on the patient, and the final plan was to discharge the patient home with hospice care, with chest tube in place.
The chest tube was connected to a pneumostat device and the patient and family were instructed in using syringes to remove fluid as it accumulates.
He was ordered for IM ceftriaxone as an outpatient, as advised by hospice care, for some antimicrobial coverage.
