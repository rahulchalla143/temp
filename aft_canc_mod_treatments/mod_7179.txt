She was treated with biliary stenting, currently with two bare metal stents within CBD / L hepatic duct (placed endoscopically) and within R hepatic duct (placed percutaneously), as well as colonic stent.
ovarian cyst, Tonsillectmy and adenoidectomy, Colonoscopy many years ago   Social History: Lives alone, sister who lives out of state and a brother.
Physical Exam: 102.1, 149, 115/57, 24, 94 on NRB A&Ox3, slightly dyspneic coarse BS BL, no rales RRR except tachy.
Foley in place (scant med-yellow urine), PIV x2.
The malignant cells are immunoreactive for cytokeratin 7 and are non-reactive for cytokeratin 20 and CDX-2.
Given the imaging findings metastatic pancreaticobiliary carcinoma is likely though other primary sites, including gastric and gynecologic, could be considered  [**11-26**] ERCP:  ADENOCARCINOMA.
She is a 58 yo female with cholangiocarcinoma, likely metastatic to the colon (with a colonic mass s/p stent placement) and s/p multiple biliary stents, currently with two bare metal stents within CBD / L hepatic duct (placed endoscopically) and within R hepatic duct (placed percutaneously) on [**12-11**].
The patient was admitted to the ICU, given multiple fluid boluses, and found to have 2/2 blood cultures growing Gram Negative Rods, later E Coli sensitive to zosyn.
She was placed on pressors until her blood pressure stabilized.
She was started on cipro, vanco, flagyl, and zosyn presumptively; the vanc and cipro discontinued following results of the blood cultures.
She was continued on the zosyn for the bacteremia and flagyl for presumptive C. difficile colitis.
On [**12-17**] she was awoke tachycardic, tachypneic, hypertensive and with rigors w/fever 101 presumed to be still septic, that resolved w/zopenex nebulizer and demerol.
She was treated empirically for both with zosyn and flagyl; follow up blood cultures on [**12-17**] were without growth.
Following normalization of her hemodynamics and control of her pneumonia, the patient was aggressively diuresed for b/l pleural effusions (thought secondary to fluid resuscitation vs parapneumonic vs malignant, though no tap performed).
Her effusions improved over time, and on [**12-23**] she was without any oxygen requirement at rest and ambulating.
By the time of discharge she was tolerating a regular diet, though remained with some residual nausea treated well with zofran PRN.
She had a PICC line placed on [**12-15**] in the RUE for antibiotic delivery.
The patient does remain with a leukocytosis today of 16.9 down from a high of 41.9 on [**12-15**], though she appears clinically stable.
She is being discharged on Ceftrixaone x 1 week and flagyl for 14 days since documented negative blood cultures.
Switched to Ceftrixaone prior to discharge.
