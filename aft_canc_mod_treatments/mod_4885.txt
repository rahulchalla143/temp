Patient has had multiple sessions of radiation therapy this week and has noticed progressive weakness and nausea.
Received dexamethasone and was able to complete therapy but went home and continued to vomit non-bloody, bilious fluid.
He was given 10 of IV dilt which brought his rate to the 120s but dropped his pressures to the 70s/40s.
A central line was placed and pt was started on levophed for persistent hypotension.
Also received solumedrol 100 mg, vancomycin, zosyn, and zofran for nausea.
On transfer was receiving 5th liter of NS and levophed was running at 0.7 mcg/kg/min.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations.

Right retroperitoneal 9.2-cm hematoma at the site of recent right adrenalectomy and nephrectomy with high-density contents consistent with more acute hemorrhage.
No ST-T wave changes   Brief Hospital Course: 49 yo M w/ h/o metastatic RCC s/p radical nephrectomy, Cyberknife and whole brain irradiation p/w syncope and found to be in new AF w/ RVR with hypotension in the ED after receiving diltiazem for rate control.
His hemodynamic status stabalized rapidly with IVF and metoprolol for rate control.
His supratherapeutic INR with reversed with vitamin K in the setting of his RP bleed.
A heparin drip was started as soon as his INR had drifted below 2.5.
A follow up CT on [**2120-9-17**] documented a stable clot at his RP bleed so he was switched to enoxaparin [**Hospital1 **], dosed for his mild renal insuffciency.
Anti Xa levels were checked 4 hours after his dose and confirmed therapeutic dosing of his enoxaparin so he was discharged to home to follow up as an outpatient with his primary oncology team.
An informal orthopedic consult confirmed that it was safe for him to weight bear after radiation to [**Last Name (un) 2043**] mets in his right hip and pelvis.
# Hypotension on admission: Baseline appears to be 110s-120s on home atenolol.
Presented in the 90s with drop to 70s after receiving diltiazem for new AF with RVR.
Hypotension completely resolved once he returned to NSR with IV hydration indicating the the cause was likely due to hypovolemia given recent vomiting and positional worsening w/ tachycardia.
Unclear trigger, though could be related to incrased adrenergy following vaso-vagal episode or after vomiting vs. hypovolemia.
Rate controlled with IVF and metoprolol he converted to sinus rhythm and metoprolol was eventually discontinued.
As discussed below, he was then anticoagulated with heparin drip due to retroperitoneal bleed, with  eventual transitioning to enoxaparin prior to discharge.
# Pulmonary embolism: Patient with prior brachial and radial tumor thrombi in his left arm s/p thrombectomy and superior pulmonary vein thrombus.
Had been anticoagulated w/ coumadin but failed with current PE.
Was reversed with vit K due to retroperitoneal bleed and started on heparin drip.
Repeat CT of abdomen showed stable RP bleed, heparin drip was stopped and started enoxaparin dosed for renal function.
Anti Xa level 4 hours after enoxaparin dose was therapeutic so he will continue his current dose as an outpt.
DDx included infectious etiology (immunosuppressed w/ steroids at baseline), reactive process in setting of stress response, vs. related to steroid use.
Received vanc and zosyn in ED, but further abx were held and WBC WNL at discharge.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Baseline creatinine was 0.9 prior to nephrectomy, but has been 1.7 since.
Nephrotoxins were avoided and all meds were renally dosed including enoxaparin.
Likely related to cumulative effect of brain irradiation +/- underlying metastatic disease to brain.
# Metastatic RCC: s/p radical R nephrectomy, Prior CyberKife therapy for R brain metastases, and initiated total brain irradiation for progressive metastatic lesions on this admission.
Plan was for initiation of Sunitinib after completion of total brain irradiation as pt not a candidate for IL2 therapy given brain mets and risk of edema.
He completed whole brain XRT on the day of discharge and will continue Decadron at 4mg [**Hospital1 **] with a taper as outpatient.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with fainting, a blood clot in your lung despite being on coumadin, low blood pressure, atrial fibrillation (a fast heart beat), and bleeding in your abdomen.
You were treated in the intensive care unit with medications for your blood pressure and to slow your heart rate.
You received radiation treatments to your brain for metastatic kidney cancer and you were started on heparin blood thinner by IV and then switched to injections.
A repeat CT of your abdomen showed that there was no new bleeding in your abdomen while you were on blood thinners for the blood clot in your lung.
The following changes have been made to your medications: STOP Warfarin (coumadin) STOP Atenalol START Metoprolol 25 mg three times daily INCREASE Dexamethasone to 4 mg in the morning and then 2 mg in the evening then follow dosage as directed  Followup Instructions: Department: HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY When: WEDNESDAY [**2120-9-25**] at 3:30 PM With: DRS.
