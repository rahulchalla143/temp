He was given two liters of saline intravenously and his pressure came up to 105/57.

The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and upon arrival, patient was noted minutes later to become hypotensive with a mean blood pressure of 40 and was then noted to have a cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity.
CPR was immediately initiated, and 1 mg of epinephrine was given.
The Doppler probe was then used to ascertain that a pulse was present and the patient was started on intravenous pressor [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Neo-Synephrine drip was started and this brought the blood pressure back up into an acceptable range.
At this point, the Cardiology Fellow was notified who performed a bedside ultrasound which confirmed the presence of a significant pericardial effusion causing tamponade physiology.
Upon further discussion with the family, it was decided to withdrawal care and provide supportive care only.
Because of this, decompression of the pericardial effusion was not pursued, and pressure support was withdrawn.
