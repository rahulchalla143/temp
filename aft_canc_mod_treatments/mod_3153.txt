This surgery was complicated by an estimated blood loss of approximately 9000 cc.

The patient was kept on a ventilator and continued to do well and was extubated on postoperative day one.
She received another 2 units of packed red blood cells as well as 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma on postoperative day one.
Her coagulations after receiving an additional unit of fresh frozen plasma remained stable.
She was on pressure support, and her FIO2 was 50%.
A Pepcid intravenous drip 20 mg twice per day was given.
