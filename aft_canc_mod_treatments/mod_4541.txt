She is to undergo placement of PTBD for a common hepatic duct stricture manifested as painless jaundice.
On [**11-12**] she had placement of a right biliary drain, however they were unable to access the left biliary system.
Initially she was started on Vanco and Meropenem and then once the sensitivities were returned she was started on Amikacin and Tigecycline.
Additionally she was transferred to the ICU with the fevers and she was also found to be in AFib.
A cardiology consult was called and they recommended continuing PO beta blocker and anticoagulation once it was safe from a bleeding/procedure standpoint.
Heparin was held for the 8 days following the Right PTC placement, and then a heparin drip was reinitiated once the HIT was returned as negative.
On [**2128-11-22**] a second try was made at placing a drain in the left biliary system.
An 8 Fr drain was placed into the left system and then a new 10 Fr drain was placed in the right system.
Coumadin was restarted once the drains were placed and her INR was followed daily.
This was continued until a feeding tube was placed and tube feeds were at goal.
She was tolerating the tube feeds and then she was started on cycled feeds.
Following long conversations with palliative care and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], it was determined by the patient and family that her goal of care was not to proceed towards rehab with goal of surgery.
In conjunction with these conversations, thyroid testing was performed and she was noted to be hypothyroid and her levothyroxine was increased to 100 mcg daily.
On [**2128-12-2**] she had metal wall stents placed to the bile ducts and on [**12-3**] the PTCs were removed.
A PICC line was placed to continue her antibiotics through [**2128-12-7**] which is 2 weeks following her last positive blood culture result.
ID was consulted during this hospitalization who recommended this antibiotic course.
Tube feedings were cycled, and the tube required manipulation to uncoil and unkink the line prior to discharge, which most likely occured during the placement s of the wall stents.
