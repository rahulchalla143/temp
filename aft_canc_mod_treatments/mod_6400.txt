Brief Hospital Course: 86 year old female with a history of HTN, CHF, COPD, Afib, and aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty was admitted for evaluation of aortic valve replacement.
At that time, she was not interested in surgical aortic valve repair but did agree to a cardiac catheterization with valvuloplasty.
She tolerated the procedure well and was discharged to rehab.
Given her persistent symptoms, she did ultimatly agree to surgery.
Unfortunately she was thought to be a very high risk for surgery due to likelihood of a difficult extubation and prolonged ventilator wean, and she was no longer a candidate for surgical aortic valve repair.
She was diuresed aggressively with a lasix drip and then transitioned to oral lasix prior to discharge.
She was initially on 4L upon admission, required BiPap briefly, and was back to 3-5L upon discharge.
Her furosemide was transitioned from a lasix drip to 120mg oral furosemide.
Atrial fibrillation She has chronic atrial fibrillation and was maintained on a beta blocker for rate control with coumadin for anticoagulation.
She was continued on her beta blocker and warfarin for symptomatic control of her symptoms secondary to atrial fibrillation.
Goals of Care Patient was initially full code upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**] in anticipation of an aortic valve repair; however, when surgical aortic valve repair was no longer an option, Ms. [**Known lastname 81165**] was clear that she would not like any further interventions.

Unfortunately you are not a candidate to have surgical repair of your valve.
We have made several changes to your medications to align with your current goals of care.
- raloxifene, lovastatin, calcium, aspirin - we have discontinued these medications as they do not seem to be treating your current symptoms.
- morphine - this is a medication you can use as you need for pain control or shortness of breath.
- seroquel - this is a medication to help you sleep at night.
