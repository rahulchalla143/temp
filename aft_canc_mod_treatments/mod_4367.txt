Post-surgical changes, status post partial pancreatectomy and splenectomy with small amount of fluid at the pancreatic bed just at the tip of drainage catheter.
Partial pancreatectomy and splenectomy changes with inflammatory changes and fluid in the surgical bed.
The drain appears to be in appropriate position.
The need for further evaluation with ultrasound should be determined on a clinical basis.
This is a nondiagnostic study - no obvious intracardiac shunt seen during color flow imaging and air buibble contrast injection, but cannot be excluded with certainty on the basis of this study .
Distal pancreas, distal pancreatectomy (C-H): Well differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, See synoptic report.
It consists of a distal pancreatectomy specimen measuring 4.5 x 3.5 x 2.7 cm with attached peripancreatic adipose tissue measuring 5 x 1.6 x 1.1 cm.
The parenchymal resection margin is inked yellow and the outer surface of the pancreas is blue inked and the specimen is sliced horizontally to reveal a solid-cystic mass measuring 2.5 x 2.3 x 1.9 cm, located 2 cm away from the parenchymal resection margin at its closest approach.
It consists of a splenectomy specimen with attached adipose tissue measuring overall 14.5 x 12.8 x 3.5 cm and weighing 311 grams.

On that date, the patient underwent distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, which was complicated by major intraoperative hemorrhage requiring additional ligation of intra-abdominal vessel for control of hemorrhage (splenic arterial takeoff).
During the surgery, the patient required the administration of 7000 mL of crystalloid, 1000mL of 5% albumin, two units of FFP, and 9 units of packed red blood cells.
After the surgery, the patient was admitted to the TICU, where he arrived NPO with an NG tube, intubated on mechanical ventilation and neomycin infusion, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter and two JP drain in place, and a Dilaudid/Bupivacaine epidural for pain control.
When tolerating a diet, the PCA was discontinued, and the patient started on oral pain medications with continued good effect.
The NG tube was discontinued, and the patient started on clears on POD#5.
The foley catheter discontinued in the afternoon of POD#4, six hours after the epidural was discontinued.
As he was unable to void, the foley was replaced, and he was started on Flomax.
Post-splenectomy immunizations consisting of the Pneumovax, Meningicoccal, and Haemophilus B vaccines were given on POD#5.
On POD#8, the patient went into atrial fibrillation, which could not be converted on the floor with Metoprolol and Lasix.
The patient was emergently transferred to the TICU for further evalaution and care.
He was intubated, placed on a neomycin drip, and treated for hyperkalemia.
When hemodynamically stable, he was returned to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 9 on [**2119-12-10**], at which point the NG tube was out, he was NPO except medications, on IV fluids, the foley was still in place, and the patient still on the Dilaudid/Bupivacaine epidural for pain control.
While on the floor, his diet had been advanced to fulls, the epidural was discontinued, and the patient started on a Dilaudid PCA, and JP amylase levels were sent.
He was transfered back to the TICU, started on a Diltiazem drip, which was converted to an Amiodarone drip due to hypotension.
Chest CT revealed findings consistent with aspiration pneumonia, for which patient was started on IV Vancomycin and Cefepime.
He developed acute renal failure with a creatinine of 2.4, which responded well to IV fluid boluses x2 with inproved urine output.
He required subsequent fluid boluses foe a FENA of 0.1.
[**2119-12-17**] C.diff was returned positive, and the patient was started on PO Vancomycin and Flagyl in addition to IV Vancomycin and Cefepime.
He was NPo with an NG tube, on IV fluids and TPN, continued on IV Vancomycin, Flagyl, and Cefepime as well as PO Vancomycin, a foley was in place, and he received acetaminophen for pain control.
Home medications were re-introduced after the NG tube was discontinued, and the patient started on sips.
TPN was discontinued on [**12-23**].
Foley was discontinued the morning of [**12-24**]; the patient was subsequently able to void without problem.
By discharge, the aspiration pneumonia was treated, and there was four days remaining of treatment for C.diff.
Physcial and Occupational Therapy were consulted.
The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay.
He received glucose monitoring and insulin administration teaching.
He was discharged to an extended care facility for rehabilitation and nursing care.
