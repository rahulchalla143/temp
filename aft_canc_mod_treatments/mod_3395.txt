Reoperative right thoracotomy with right upper lobectomy     and en bloc right chest wall resection (ribs 3,4 and 5)     with [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex chest wall reconstruction and     decortication of right middle and right lower lobes   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 75713**] was initially evaluated for resectability of a locally-advanced right lung cancer.
He underwent cervical and anterior mediastinoscopy that did not show any involvement of the mediastinal lymph nodes followed by a thoracoscopy and subsequent exploratory thoracotomy which defined a chest wall invasive lesion felt to be T3 if not, T4 because I presume a diffuse pleural involvement.
He was deemed unresectable and then begun on chemotherapy, which has consisted of a weekly carboplatin and Taxol with Avastin under the care of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the Cancer Center of [**Location (un) 86**].
He now presents for resection of localy advanced tumor.
INDICATION: 70-year-old male with right lung cancer status post right upper lobectomy and bronchoscopy.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial CT images of the chest are obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
FINDINGS: The patient is status post right thoracotomy with right upper lobectomy for lung cancer with surgical sutures.
Again note is made of large right pneumothorax occupying approximately half of the right hemithorax, with two chest tubes and hydropneumothorax at the base.
The anterior chest tube terminates in the apex in the pneumothorax cavity, and posterior chest tube crosses posterior aspect of the pleura and terminates at the apex.
Just above the anterior chest tube exit from the thoracic cavity, the pneumothorax cavity and the subcutaneous emphysema cavity appears to be communicated.
There is evidence of prior right thoracotomy in the right upper ribs, with chest wall reconstruction with thin mesh.
The evaluation of mediastinal structures and great vessels is limited due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Limited study due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for assessment of mediastinum and great vessels.
Two chest tubes as described above.
Post-right upper lobectomy for lung cancer, with surgical changes and prior thoracotomy and chest reconstruction changes, as well as soft tissue density surrounding the surgical suture likely postoperative, however, continued followup is recommended.

He tolerated the procedure well.
He was initially treated with IV Lopressor.
Subsequently he was transitioned to PO Lopressor and eventually his home atenolol dose.
No new cardiovascular medications were added during this hospitalization.
He was started on nebulizers as well as expectorants to help clear airway secretions.
Chest tubes were kept on suction as he had a significant air leak, which was expected from the extent of the surgery.
His chest tubes were sequentially removed.
No further intervention was made.
His antibiotics were tailored to include ciprofloxacin.
We will adjust antibiotics accordingly.
Neuro: Pain was initially well controlled with an epidural.
This was then transitioned to Percocet with good pain control.
