He was given vanco/flagyl in the ED and ordered for levofloxacin but did not receive it due to timing and access.

He was started on an 8 day course of vanco/cefepime/flagyl for HAP and aspiration coverage on [**8-23**].
He was kept on contact precautions for presumed MRSA.
Initially, he was ventilated on Assist Control, but overbreathing on this setting and high autoPEEP prompted switching him to PS with increased sedation.
He required 2-limb restraints to prevent self-extubation throughout his MICU course.
Pt was kept on bronchodilators and sedated to comfort on Versed and Fentanyl drips with intermittent boluses for agitation.
Attempts to wean him off the ventilator were unsuccessful.
Pt was kept NPO for entire MICU course.
The pt continued to spike on broad-spectrum antibiotics that should have covered all bacterial infections.
Despite finishing an 8-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics for aspiration PNA/sepsis and improving in terms of infectious signs (pressures, wbc, lactate), pt's overall condition did not improve.
Initially adrenal insufficiency was also in the differential: this became unlikely since stress-dose steroids in-house did not improve his pressures.
Pt received a considerable amount of fluids (+8.5L TBB) and was diuresed with Lasix once off pressors and with stable sbp>100.
He was started on IV PPI at admission.
DIC was unlikely given wnl and then elevated fibrinogen.

Pt's family seemed ready to keep him at intubated on a vent and sedated for an indefinite period.
# ARF: had new ARF at admission, but Cr returned to [**Location 213**] after receiving fluids and remained stably normal.
