Per the neurosurgery consult, the patient was not a surgical candidate since he already had baseline bowel/bladder incontinence and left leg weakness from his prior cord compression, and surgery would be very unlikely to improve this baseline.
He remained on 2L nasal cannula which is his baseline.
For his cord compression, his oncologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1557**] was called who recommended starting dexamethasone 40mg PO daily.
His dexamethasone was tapered first to 16mg  for the remainder of his XRT treatments then to 8mg afterwards with plans to taper upon follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**].
Although initially obtaining good control of his pain, he became increasingly oversedated and had an episode of decreased respiratory rate and obtundation which required transfer to ICU for 2d, dsepite discontinuation of PCA.
We started him on venlafaxine and dc'd his citalopram with hopes of addressing his baseline anxiety and he will be discharged with dose of 75mg with plans to increase to 150mg 2d after his discharge  A wound care consult was obtained for his prior neurosurgical wound and his decubitus ulcers.
They recommended wet-to-dry dressing to his surgical wound and local wound care with micoazole for his pressure ulcers.
A neurology consult was obtained to evaluate if his aspiration could be due to his cord compression causing diaphragmatic hemiparesis or some other neurolgic defect.
