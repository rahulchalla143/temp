Extensive ground-glass and consolidative parenchymal opacities, involving all lobes, with a nondependent-dependent gradient increased in severity, most compatible with ARDS.
Hypoxic respiratory failure: He was initially given aggressive intravenous fluids (5L) to correct severe hypercalcemia and developed pulmonary edema and acute respiratory failure prompting intubation and ICU admission.
He was placed on a furosemide drip but urine output was minimal due to acutre renal failure secondary to light chain nephrotoxicity.
He required CVVH (started [**2153-6-12**]) which successfully removed fluid and allowed for extubation.
He received aggressive intravenous fluids and pamidronate infusion.
He received a bone marrow biopsy on [**2153-6-19**] that showed plasma cell myeloma with plasma cells comprising 33% of aspirate.
He was started on velcade and dexamethasone on [**2153-6-18**], and needs his last dose of velcade on [**2153-6-29**] and dexamethasone on [**2153-6-29**] and [**2153-6-30**].
He was started on PCP prophylaxis with bactrim and continued on acyclovir for HSV prophylaxis.
Alternatively he received radiation to the femur lesion (total 5 treatments, last treatment [**2153-6-27**]).
Initially as still making urine and able to diuresis with Lasix, however the patient became progressively anuric, with his creatinine peaking at 9.9.
He commenced dialysis and will continue with HD M/W/F as an outpatient.
He did not receive plasmapheresis per recommendations from the transfusion medicine team (data shows lack of benefit from plasmapheresis with elevated light chains due to extensive tissue/fat distribution and short half life of proteins).
CKMB trended down, although troponin T remained elevated likely secondary to renal insufficiency.
He was seen by cardiology and started on metoprolol with adequate rate control.
Received a total of 8 units of PRBCs during admission.
He was started on heparin SQ DVT prophylaxis once platelets improved and should continue this upon discharge due to ongoing immobility.
