Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 73953**] was a 76 year old woman with PMH of COPD on home O2 of 3L NC, HTN, CHF, IDDM, PVD with stents to bilateral legs, recently diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma with mets to the liver who presented with progressive shortness of breath requiring non-invasive ventilation at OSH and was intubated to protect her airway and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible stenting of the right bronchus intermedius as a means to potentially improve her baseline shortness of breath.
Respiratory failure: The patient had progressive shortness of breath that required noninvasive ventilation at OSH.
Review of CT from 2 weeks prior demonstrated near-complete collapse of bronchus intermedius.
IP performed bedside bronchoscopy via her ET tube and found now complete collapse.
Because of the anatomy of her occlusion, stenting was not possible.
She received the first of 2 palliative radiation treatments without improvement in her respiratory status.
Due to progressive oxygen requirements and poor prognosis, decision was made with her husband and children to change focus of care to comfort.
She was given a morphine drip and passed away at 11:10am.
