Distended stomach with no contrast seen to pass past the antrum; a delayed KUB could be obtained to ensure passage of barium and exclude gastroparesis or obstruction.
[**2101-8-16**] EGD: Erythema and nodularity in the whole duodenum compatible with duodenitis (biopsy) Biopsies were taken from the duodenum for viral culture and histology Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum [**2101-8-26**]: Duplex doppler US liver: Moderately distended gallbladder with sludge and stones, but gallbladder wall thickening not as prominent on today's study.
Cholecystitis is not currently suspected, but if clinical suspicion persists or increases, repeat ultrasound and/or HIDA scan can be performed.
Evaluation of the bowel is limited given lack of IV contrast, but bowel wall thickening is again seen suggestive of graft versus host disease.
Respiratory distress/arrest: Pt emergently intubated on the floor due to acute respiratory failure.
He was continued on IV Methylprednisolone.
Pt was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics-Daptomycin, Meropenem, Micofungin, and Vancomycin.
