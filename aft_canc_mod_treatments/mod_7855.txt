Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 59 yo F with PMH left upper lobe NSCLC stage IV adenocarcinoma with brain mets s/p met resection, cyberknife, and whole brain radiation completed on [**2185-11-29**] not currently undergoing chemo (planned to start this on [**2185-12-8**]) who reports being too weak to get out of bed for past four days with very poor po intake.
Started heparin drip without bolus in ED per onc recs in effort to treat PE but reduce risk of hemorrhage into brain mets.
IP felt chest tube was appropriate if patient was not CMO however patient wanted to think about this more.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

Results were relayed over the phone initially to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19409**] at approximately 12:05 p.m. on the day of study and then reviewed in person at approximately 12:10 p.m.  CTA C/A/P:1.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo P with PMH NSCLC stage IV adenocarcinoma with brain mets s/p met resection, cyberknife, whole brain radiation completed on [**2185-11-29**] not currently undergoing chemo (planned to start this on [**2185-12-8**]) who presented with lethargy and hypotension, found to have PTX and bilateral PE in the setting of cancer progression on imaging.
Likely secondary to poor po intake as pt reports being bedbound for several days.
Lactate was 12 on transfer for [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Ms. [**Known lastname 91176**] was subsequently maintained on IV maintenance fluids for SBPs in the 80s-90's from [**Date range (1) 25029**].
Comfortable on 2 Liters nasal cannula on admission.
Gave heparin drip without bolus to reduce bleeding risk and then switched to lovenox on hospital day 2.
Given patients prognosis and desire to avoid chest tube IP agreed that if pt was comfortable they could follow and intervene later if necessary.
# NSCLC stage IV adenocarcinoma with brain/liver/abdominal mets: Per primary oncologist, no current indication for chemotherapy given her very poor prognosis and performance status.
Continued Levetiracetam for seizure prophylaxis in setting of brain mets.
# Leukocytosis: Given PNA on chest CT, leukocytosis may be secondary to infection.
Unfortunately leukocytosis progressed despite treatment of PEs as well as PNA and may represent inflammatory state incurred by advanced malignancy.
Laboratory tests were discontinued on [**2185-12-9**] when Ms. [**Known lastname 91176**] decided to become CMO.
Medications on Admission: LEVETIRACETAM -  (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 250 mg Tablet - 3 Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day   Discharge Medications: None, the patient passed away  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic Lung Cancer Deep Vein Thrombosis Pulmonary Embolism Spontaneous Pneumothorax Epilepsy secondary to metastastatic brain lesions   Discharge Condition: Patient passed away on [**2185-12-11**]  Discharge Instructions: None needed, patient passed away on [**2185-12-11**]   Followup Instructions: None needed, patient passed away on [**2185-12-11**]
