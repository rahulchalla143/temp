Impression:  The patient is a 76 year old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, carotid stenosis, pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis on Coumadin, prior right frontal hemorrhage and prior seizure, who presents with convulsions requiring Ativan and intubation.
An Oncology consultation was obtained and it was felt that given the patient's decreased mobility and current physical condition and poor functional status that the benefits of systemic chemotherapy did not outweigh the risks and chemotherapy was not advised.
A Neuro-Oncology consultation was also obtain with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 55**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 25**], who will also follow-up with the patient as an outpatient.
Regarding the patient's seizure, she was started on Depakote and has remained seizure free through her hospital stay.
With regard to her elevated troponin on admission, the patient was continued on Lopressor, however, at the time of discharge her Lopressor dosage was decreased to 25 twice a day to prevent hypoperfusion of her brain given her carotid stenosis.
The patient also should continue her Lipitor.
NOTE:  This is an addendum to one of the prior paragraphs where I discussed the patient's intracranial lesions and her surgeries:  To continue, the patient has been evaluated by Radiation Oncology and is to begin radiation therapy for additional intracranial lesions.
Left upper extremity swelling:  During the patient's Intensive Care stay, she was noted to have swelling in the left upper extremity that was concerning for the possibility of a subclavian vein thrombosis.
In regards to nutrition, the patient received tube feeds through most of her hospital stay, and a swallowing evaluation was performed during which the patient frankly aspirated; this led to the placement of a PEG tube.
The patient should continue on tube feeds and may benefit from a swallowing study in the future.
Her tube feed residuals should be closely monitored and she should continue on aspiration precautions.
After the patient's swallowing evaluation, she was noted to have continued hoarseness of voice that was initially felt to be related to her intubation.
From a respiratory perspective, the patient had undergone extubation after her hospital stay, but failed secondary to increased secretions.
She was subsequently re-intubated and was extubated after her surgical procedure.
Cultures subsequently demonstrated Staphylococcus aureus and the patient was placed on Oxacillin for a 14 day course to treat possible Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.
A PICC line was placed to continue antibiotic therapy and the patient should continue Oxacillin treatments that were started on [**5-13**], to continue a 14 day course.
Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis was maintained with heparin subcutaneously.
Regardless, from a Neurosurgical perspective, it is felt that the patient should be maintained off anticoagulation unless emergent, for approximately two to three weeks.
She should continue on heparin subcutaneously as an outpatient.
She is continued on Decadron 4 mg intravenously q. eight hours, which will be changed to per PEG at discharge.
While to patient is receiving steroid treatment she should have her fingerstick blood glucose levels closely followed and covered with an insulin sliding scale.
She should also continue on a proton pump inhibitor.
Atorvastatin 10 mg per PEG q. day.
Docusate 100 mg per PEG twice a day.
Bisacodyl 10 mg per PEG or rectum p.r.n.
Insulin sliding scale.
Lansoprazole 30 mg per PEG q. day.
Metoprolol 25 mg per PEG twice a day to be held for heart rate less than 55, for blood pressure less than 110.
Oxacillin 2 grams intravenous q. six hours started [**2184-5-12**], and should be continued for 14 days.
Valproate 500 mg per PEG three times a day.
Furosemide 10 mg per PEG q. day; the patient's potassium should be followed q. week.
Dexamethasone 4 mg per PEG three times a day.
The patient should continue her insulin sliding scale and gastrointestinal prophylaxis while taking Dexamethasone.
Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twice a day.
Acetaminophen 650 mg per rectum or per PEG q. four to six hours p.r.n.
Nutrition:  The patient is to continue with tube feeds of ProMod with fiber to be slowly increased to a goal of 55 cc.
The patient should continue on a multivitamin per PEG q. day.
PEG tube residuals may be checked.
