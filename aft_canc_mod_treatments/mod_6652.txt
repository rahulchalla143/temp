Admission Date:  [**2173-1-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-4-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2112-10-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: WBC of 185K  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bone marrow biopsy Endotracheal Intubation PICC line placement and removal PEG tube placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 60yo F w/ a PMH of hypothyroidism, hypertension, fibromyalgia and hyperlipidemia who presented to an OSH today for evaluation of a month of night sweats, worsening back pain, frequent and easy bruising, and fatigue.
She was reportedly given cryoprecipitate and antibiotics (but there is no documentation of this) and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Her transaminases were elevated, her uric acid was 7.8, LDH 897, INR 1.4, K 3.2, Cr 1.0 and fibrinogen 197.
She usually takes tylenol for this but her last dose of tylenol was this AM.
2+ DTR at [**Name2 (NI) 15219**] bilaterally.
Right internal jugular catheter tip is in the SVC with no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Ill-defined bibasilar reticular opacities are new and of uncertain etiology, for which, if clinically indicated, further evaluation with CT for further characterization could be performed.
Right IJ line tip is in the SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: Initial BMT floor course: After admission to the BMT floor, pt was started on treatment with cytarabine.
She received one round of leukopheresis on [**1-31**] and one on [**2-1**].
She was 6L positive and on [**2-1**], she again had a desaturation to 87% on 2L NC and was febrile to 101.1.
She was diuresed with lasix with some response, and was also started on aztreonam.
She remained persistently febrile to 103.8 and vancomycin was started as well.
She was started on 10mg IV decadron.
Potential etiologies of her respiratory failure considered were pulmonary edema in the setting of fluid overload, pulmonary hemorrhage, TRALI, leukostasis, or pneumonia.
ICU course: Initially placed on BIPAP 2 hours on, 1 hour off for 2 days and then was weaned off to 3LO2 NC.
She was continued on vanc/aztreonam and levoflox was added for atypical coverage.
She also developed acute renal failure and therefore her cytarabine and hydrea were held.
She has been off BIPAP for >36hours and was transferred to the BMT floor for further management.
She was received 3 more doses of ARA-c and 3 days of idarubicin and continued on ATRA to day #11.
Steroids were weaned, creatinine return to near baselin levels, and O2 requirement resolved.
On [**2-9**] patient developed necrotic oral lesions that were swabbed and treatment dose of acyclovir was initiated.
On [**2-11**], oral swab showed evidence of HSV-like cytopathic effect and acyclovir was changed to IV.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course: #) Respiratory Failure:  Pt was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with hemopytsis and worsening respiratory distress, intubated on [**2173-2-15**] & bronchoscopy was performed on [**2-15**] & [**2-16**].
Pt was treated with empiric Abx while neutropenic & febrile with Vanc/Aztreonam/Fluconazole & Acyclovir with plan to continue abx until [**3-7**] to complete 7 day course post resolution of neutropenia.
Pt was weaned from the vent with aggressive diuresis & was extubated on [**2-24**].
Acyclovir was switched to prophylactic dose after pt had received 14 days of treatment dose and is no longer neutrapenic.
Pt also completed 5/5 days of levofloxacin for atypical coverage.
Fluconazole was switched to Caspofungin on [**2-22**] due to positive glucan, will need to f/u on repeat fungal studies.
Currently, pt is maintaining sats with 2L NC but has not been able to take significant po, started TPN on [**3-1**].
?Pt was noted during & s/p extubation, pt was noted to have a persistent respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation.
Pt was continued on viscous lidocaine, magic mouthwash, ativan, morphine for pain/anxiety.
Cardiology was consulted and pt was started on afterload reduction with nitrates & lasix diuresis.
Per cards, pt was started on coreg, valsartan and isordil.
However, after extubation BP has been difficult to control due to inability to take po meds, currently on IV Labetalol, Hydralazine, Lasix & started Clonidine patch on [**3-2**].
#) APML: Day 25 s/p induction with 7+3 and Atra.
Pt was intermittently febrile & neutropenic throughout ICU course on broad spectrum ABx including Vanc, Aztreonam, Acyclovir, Caspofungin & completed a 5 day course of Levo for atypical coverage.
#)  HTN: BP was well controlled while intubated on Carvedilol, Valsartan, Sotalol & IV lasix diuresis.
However, pt has been unable to take po & pressures became persistently elevated since extubation requiring max dose IV meds including Hydralazine, Labetalol, Lasix & on [**3-2**], pt was started on a Clonidine patch.
Continue current regimen & anticipate >24hrs before onset of action for Clonidine patch.
#) HSV:  Pt had hard palate swabs positive for HSV, Acyclovir was increased to treatment dose and pt completed a 14day course.
Pt still unable to take significant po due to mucositis, Acyclovir was decreased to ppx dose on [**2-28**] and pt was continued on viscous lidocaine, Magic Mouthwash, Morphine & Ativan prn.
D/w ID who recommended continuing ppx dose Acyclovir, monitor for interval worsening, and consider reswabbing HSV DFA is no improvement.
# APML (15-17) s/p cytarbine, idarubicin followed by ATRA, intra-thecal ara-c on [**3-5**] - Had LP and per hemepath there were no definite blasts in CSF from [**3-5**]; did have myeloid precursors but likely contamination from peripheral blood - pt was continued on ATRA, along with Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis [**Name Initial (PRE) **] leukocytosis initially which was thought to be [**1-16**] ATRA maturation of cells and recovery of marrow which was consistent with normalization after a few days.
- continued to have early cells in peripheral blood including bands, myelos, promyelos; somewhat worrisome and another incentive to cont therapy soon especially considering the fact that the cure rate for patients with this disease is about 70% and the normal treatment for this disease is 3 rounds of anthracyclines + ATRA --> therefore risks and benefits were discussed with patient regarding further anthracyclines and it was decided to continue with mitoxantrine for a second round on [**3-15**] given that there is often an acute non-cumulative dose related cardiac toxicity in patients that receive anthracyclines.
Prior to therapy cards were consulted who agreed pt had not received an amount of anthracycline that would put her at risk for a cumulative effect and could not say definitively that the first event was due to idarubacin although it was the most likely cause.
Prophylaxis with Dexrazoxane 500mg IV given 30 minutes prior to each dose of mitoxantrone was used for prevention of cardiac toxicity.
Her counts reached an appropriate nadir without complication with intermittent transfusions for low platelets and hematocrits and subsequently recovered.
She continued to received prophylactic acyclovir, fluconazole, and Bactrim.
She received a repeat bone marrow biopsy on day +16 s/p mitoxantrine.
Pt had global hypokinesis and was on diuretic therapy when I came on the service with metoprolol.
The BB was continued and titrated to better HR control ( was on metoprolol 37.5mg po bid by the time I signed off).
At the time of euvolemia she still had significant dependant edema ([**12-16**]+) but given euvolemic we held further diuresis and allowed pt to equilibrate and eventually autodiurese (as EF has recovered).
Prophylaxis with Dexrazoxane 500mg IV given 30 minutes prior to each dose of mitoxantrone was used for prevention of cardiac toxicity for the second round of anthracyclines.
The PICC was removed and she was begun on Lovenox for anticoagulation.
As her platelets decreased below 70, her Lovenox was held and then restarted after they increased again.
She was continued on Lovenox on discharge for another 2 weeks.
# Aspiration pneumonia - completed 10 days of flagyl and levofloxacin today on [**3-13**] and remained afebrile thorugh entire course and afterwards .
# Profound Dysphagia, weakness - failed swallow eval and then had video swallow demonstarting pt may take nectar pre-thickened fluids but given that pt would not be able to take enough PO a PEG was placed by GI and TFs started.
She was initially started on Reglan with improvement in her residuals.
A re-evaluation by speech and swallow showed that she was able to take thin liquids and a soft diet.
Her tube feeds were stopped approximately 1 week prior to discharge.
In discussion with GI, they felt her PEG tract was not mature enough for removal at the time of discharge.
She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6880**] on [**4-13**] for removal in the GI suite but his office may contact her with an earlier appointment.
