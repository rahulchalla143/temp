Right thoracotomy with transthoracic esophagectomy,     laparotomy, and left cervicotomy with cervical     esophagogastrostomy.
INDICATIONS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 86746**] is a 62-year-old woman with biopsy- proven T3, N1, stage III carcinoma of the distal esophagus with lymph nodes that were PET-positive extending well up into the superior thorax.
She has been treated with induction chemoradiotherapy with an objective response.
Residual PET- positive lymph nodes were evaluated thoracoscopically and with mediastinoscopy and were found to be sarcoidal.
A left-sided double-lumen endotracheal tube was positioned above the left lobar carina, and the bronchoscope was removed.
A 0-silk suture was placed in the dome of the diaphragm to retract it inferiorly and improve exposure.
The esophagus was looped with a Penrose drain and dissected free of its mediastinal attachments down to the crura of the diaphragm inferiorly.
The chest was then drained with a 28-French chest tube passed posteriorly and apically through a separate stab wound inferiorly.
The ribs were then reapproximated with #1-Vicryl pericostal sutures.
Steri-Strips and dry dressings were applied.
The patient was returned to the supine position and reintubated with a single-lumen endotracheal tube.
The Penrose drain was replaced around it.
Lymphoid tissue was then swept up towards the stomach, and the balance of this dissection was done with the cautery.
We then prepared a gastric tube along the greater curvature based on the right gastroepiploic blood supply with 4 applications of the [**Female First Name (un) 3224**] stapler.
We secured a 30 mL balloon Foley catheter to the umbilical tape and put the balloon inside an arthroscopy drape which was secured around the balloon with a silk tie.
The umbilical tape was then pulled back to the neck, bringing the Foley catheter through the posterior mediastinum and to the neck.
The gastric conduit was placed in the arthroscopy drape, and the Foley catheter was placed on suction, allowing the drape itself to clamp atraumatically down around the conduit, which was then delivered to the neck under no tension.
We then performed an end-to-end anastomosis by suturing the esophageal remnant proximally to the posterior aspect of the gastric fundus.
The esophageal staple line was amputated.
A gastrotomy was made in the posterior wall of the tip of the fundic tube.
These were placed and tied, and then the nasogastric tube was advanced across the anastomosis.
The anterior row of sutures was placed with the knots on the outside.
The neck was irrigated with saline and drained with a 10 mm flat [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain.
This was exited through a separate stab wound, secured to the skin with nylon suture, and placed to bulb suction.
A dry dressing was applied.
The abdomen was then irrigated, and hemostasis appeared adequate.
Dry dressings were applied.
The patient tolerated the procedure quite well and was transferred intubated to the surgical intensive care unit in satisfactory condition.
NG tube reaches below diaphragm.
A right-sided chest tube in place terminating in the right apical area.
Area of upper abdomen shows now status post surgery with midline metallic staple line and surgical clips in left hiatal area.
***** [**2197-12-13**] CT TORSO: INDICATION: Esophagectomy now with fever.
TECHNIQUE: Oral contrast was administered through the J-tube, and MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images through the torso without IV contrast.
The study was compared with [**2197-10-23**] CT scan from PET-CT.  CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Esophagectomy surgical drainage tube to the left of the pull-through.
Endotracheal tube terminates in the appropriate location.
Nasogastric tube terminates just below the esophageal hiatus.
Swan- Ganz catheter terminating in the right pulmonary artery trunk.
Right-sided chest tube terminating in the right lung posterior apex.
A jejunostomy tube is seen in the left lower quadrant.
There are enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, for example, para-aortic node measuring 10 mm in short axis (series 2 image 70).
Right femoral line terminates in the proximal common iliac arteries.
Multiplanar reformats were essential in delineating the findings above, particularly in the absence of IV contrast.
***** [**2197-12-26**] POST PACER PLACEMENT XRAY [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 62 year old woman with episodes of asystole, need to place temporary pacing wire.
One video image was obtained after chest fluoroscopy.
[**2197-12-30**] CT SINUS: [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 62 year old woman s/p esophagectomy complicated by pneumonia, afib, ARF, sepsis, febrile from unknown cause.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: acute renal failure  HISTORY: 62-year-old female status post esophagectomy, complicated by pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure and sepsis.
COMPARISON: Multiple prior chest radiographs, and head CT from [**2197-11-2**].
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial imaging of the paranasal sinuses was performed without intravenous contrast.
***** [**2197-12-31**] RUQ ULTRASOUND: RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The gallbladder is markedly distended and contains shadowing stones.
IMPRESSION: Cholelithiasis but no definite evidence of acute cholecystitis.
***** [**2198-1-4**] CT TORSO: INDICATION: 62-year-old status post esophagectomy with prolonged stay in ICU, now with ARDS.
FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube remains well positioned.
Left-sided subclavian line terminates in the proximal SVC.
Patient is status post esophagectomy with post-surgical changes.
IMPRESSION: 1) Persistent dense multifocal consolidation, slightly improved in the right lung, but slightly worsened in the left lung.
4) Status post esophagectomy, not well evaluated without IV or oral contrast.
Air-fluid levels in the sphenoid and right maxillary sinus and opacification of several ethmoid air cells, and bilateral mastoid air cells are all suggestive of sinusitis.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 86746**] underwent uncomplicated tri-incision esophagogastrectomy on [**2197-12-6**] and was transferred to the SICU postoperatively in stable condition.
On POD 1 she went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and was started on amiodarone drip with diltiazem for rate control.
She also had an episode of hypotension with concurrent ST elevations on EKG, so cardiac enzymes were sent and she was started on Levophed.
Cardiology service was consulted and recommended switching beta blockade to esmolol.
She also became febrile to 102.1, so pancultures were sent and she was started on Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Zosyn in addition to Flagyl.
D/C cardioversion was attempted multiple times with little improvement in her Afib.
As her renal function was worsening she was started on CVVHD on POD 7.
Her tube feeds were DC'd and TPN was started on POD 8 because she was regurgitating bilious material.
She converted spontaneously back to sinus rhythm, and pressors were briefly weaned.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 86746**] was improving slowly until [**2197-12-20**], when she went back into rapid AFib and was restarted on amiodarone drip.
The next day she had a brief episode of asystole for 20 seconds after suctioning, but recovered after chest compressions.
She had several further episodes of brief asystole/acute bradycardia over the next few days, so a transvenous temporary pacemaker lead was placed by EP on [**12-26**].
She remained relatively stable, requiring constant pressors and ventilation and intermittently in Afib, but her chest xrays continued to show increased infiltrates bilaterally.
Esmolol was restarted briefly and she was started on pitressin in addition to neo for additional pressure support.
Her pO2 began to decrease gradually despite continued aggressive ventilation with [**Last Name (LF) 97798**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was paralyzed in an attempt to prevent vent dyssynchrony.
