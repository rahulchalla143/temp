Ultimately a PEG tube was placed and the patient was discharged home with VNA for further work-up as an outpatient.
In her last hospitalization she underwent an EGD (biopsy with blunted villi and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes), colonoscopy, transvaginal ultrasound, Mammogram, PEG placement, and a bronchoscopy.
Patient was given ceftriaxone 1g, flagyl 500mg and azithromycin 500mg.

Percutaneous gastrostomy is projecting over the left upper quadrant.
During her time in the ICU, she was treated for 8 days for hospital acquired PNA with vancomycin and cefepime and ultimately narrowed to CTX for proteus that grew out of her sputum.
A trial extubation occurred after treatment with antibiotics and scopolamine to try to decrease secretions, but she became acutely dyspenic almost immediately after extubation and required re-intubation.
She continued to require frequent suctioning while on the floor and ultimately failed a Passy-Muir valve trial due to her secretions.
# Anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] antibody syndrome and [**Location (un) **]-[**Location (un) **] myasthenic syndrome:  Neurology was consulted early in her hospital course, as they have been following her previously.
Anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] Ab and voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies found to be positive.
Neurology continued to follow the patient while in house and she was treated with 5 days of IVIg, prednisone 60mg qd, and Mestinon 60mg PO for symptomatic relief of her muscle weakness and oculobulbar symptoms (disconjugate gaze and dysphagia).
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1206**] of Neurology discussed numerous options for her future treatment course to manage her symptoms.
She will follow up with him for initiation of treatments and to review her CT scan, currently scheduled for [**7-3**] to further investigate a primary lung malignancy.
# Hematocrit drop: Her hematocrit started trending down while in the MICU and she was transfused 1 unit of pRBCs with good response.
While on the general medicine floor, her hematocrit hit a nadir of 18.9, but once again resolved with administration of 2 units of packed RBCs to 28.2.
Free water was restricted and sodium eventually normalized.
#Thrombocytosis: Platelet elevation likely due to its role as an acute phase reactant, as ferritin and haptoglobin have a similar role and were also elevated.

In the MICU we had to place a breathing tube to assist your breathing and a tracheostomy tube as well.
We treated a suspected pneumonia with antibiotics and it resolved.
When you were stable, you were transferred to a general medical floor where we managed your tracheostomy tube, treated you for your newly diagnosed anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] antibody syndrome and [**Location (un) **]-[**Location (un) **] myasthenic syndrome with medications to help control your symptoms.
