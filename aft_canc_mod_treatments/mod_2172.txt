Pt was given normal saline, 5 mg diazepam PO, morphine 4 mg IV x2, and ceftriaxone 1g.

No heart sounds or breathing while listening over precordium for 1 minute.
Compression fractures are identified at T3 and T6, the latter with mild retropulsion and indentation on the spinal cord.
Abnormal region enhancing mass noted in the right distal ureter causing proximal right hydronephrosis and hydroureter concerning for either a transitional carcinoma of the right distal ureter versus a bladder mass invading the right ureteric orifice.
Advancement by at least 6 cm is recommended to bring the tip of the PICC line into the SVC.
The Dobbhoff tube tip is below the inferior margin of the film, most likely in the stomach.
Hospital course complicated by perforation of the bladder and significant hematuria requiring 4 units of RBCs and transfer to MICU.
She also required emergent cystoscopy and had hypoxic respiratory distress.
Patient was transferred to the oncology floor when her respiratory distress improved with diuresis, however, returned to the ICU after IV fluid administration for hypercalcemia worsened her respiratory status.
As patient was not deemed to be a candidate for a radiation or chemotherapy for her primary cancer given her poor functional status, multiple discussions with the family, ICU/medical team and palliative care team were had and patient was made comfort measures only.
She was started on aggressive comfort measures to control her pain from osseous metastases and also to ease her breathing and died on [**2172-3-2**].
# ACUTE HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient presented following her repeat cystoscopy with worsening oxygen requirement and she has acute hypoxia with 2D-Echo showing systolic dysfunction with a prior anterolateral injury and evidence of hypokinesia that likely resulted in volume overload and flash pulmonary edema.
She responded to Lasix diuresis and her oxygenation improved.
She was also given nebulizer treatments.
Her initial oxygen requirement was a non-rebreather and she quickly weaned to nasal cannula.
She required a short return to the ICU given some fluid administration needs and with diuresis and anti-hypertensive therapy her respiratory status stabilized.
Her infection concerns were treated, her metabolic derangements were addressed and we felt her pain control and ICU delirium was most likely contributing.
We optimized her medication regimen, controlled her pain with Dilaudid and optimized her sleep cycles.
# URETERAL MASS/UROTHELIAL CARCINOMA: She was initially sent to the ED for back pain.
She was started on continuous bladder irrigation for hematuria.
She was transfused 4 units of packed red cells and transferred to the MICU.
Urology repeated her cystoscopy and noted a bladder tear which was conservatively managed with continuous bladder irrigation.
# HYPERCALCEMIA: Transient elevation in serum calcium to 10-11 range in the setting of malignancy which improved with bisphosphonate administration, calcitonin and diuretic therapy; given her volume concern issues, fluids were deferred for calcium management.
She was given morphine and MS contin, as well as dexamethasone and gabapentin.
Dilaudid was switched to morphine due to confusion.
Radiation Oncology was consulted for palliative radiation options.
She initiated palliative spine radiation this admission.
She was given IV fluids initially and her creatinine improved to baseline.
Following resuscitation, her creatinine remained stable in the setting of diuresis needs.
Metoprolol was restarted and uptitrated for hypertension and tachycardia given her episode of flash pulmonary edema and ongoing respiratory distress.
Her 2D-Echo demonstrated cardiac dysfunction with a diastolic component which was treated with ACEI and beta-blocker therapy.
# PVD: Status post aorto-carotid and aorto-bifemoral bypasses.
On aggrenox at home.
This was held in preparation for biopsy and remained off in the setting of bleeding.
Continued home levothyroxine .
# SEIZURE HISTORY: We continued phenytoin, vitamin B6 supplementation.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was asymptomatic but was treated for 7 days with ceftriaxone then dicloxacillin for urine culture showing staph epi.
