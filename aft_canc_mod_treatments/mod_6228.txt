Admission Date:  [**2166-2-25**]              [**Year/Month/Day **] Date:   [**2166-3-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2125-12-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: UROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4533**] Chief Complaint: continued intubation/monitoring s/p R radical nephrectomy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: R radical nephrectomy and s/p intubation  History of Present Illness: 40yo man with h/o ascending aortic dissection in [**2160**] s/p repair and St. Jude's valve placement on coumadin ([**2160**]), s/p recent R perinephric bleed requiring IR embolization([**11/2165**]), CRI with h/o ATN requiring CVVH post procedure, HTN, who was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring after R radical nephrectomy and removal of large renal mass.
The patient was admitted to the OR with urology service for R radical nephrectomy and removal of large renal mass (13cm) suspicious for malignancy today.
Patient was bridged with heparin prior to procedure.
On arrival to ICU, patient was intubated and sedated on propofol.
Past Medical History: -Large ascending aortic dissection in [**2160**] s/p Dacron graft placement and St. Jude's valve placement (on coumadin goal INR 2.5-3.5) -R perinephric bleed s/p IR embolization of R kidney ([**2165-12-15**]) -R renal mass -Hypertension -Hypercholesterolemia -Mild chronic kidney disease (baseline Cr 1.1-1.3)   Social History: married, has 3 children.
98.7, 165/49, 77 GENERAL - intubated, sedated HEENT - PERRLA NECK - supple, no thyromegaly, JVP=10 LUNGS - CTA anteriorly HEART - +mechanical SEM in across precordium, no rubs ABDOMEN - dressings over large right flank incision site, c/d/i, soft, trace bowel sounds EXTREMITIES - WWP, no LE edema   Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted post-operatively to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU under Dr.[**Name (NI) 24219**] Urology service.
He remained intubated overnight due to the length of the case, but did well overnight, weaning on vent settings appropriately and he was extubated without difficulty on POD 1.
His heparin anticoagulation was restarted approximately 8 hours after surgery at 1 am on [**2166-2-28**].
In late POD 1, early POD 2, he was noted to have a decreasing hct, for which he received a transfusion of 2u pRBCs.
Of note, he was given two doses of lasix 40 mg IV on POD 1.
Heparin gtt was stopped and the patient was transfused as necessary to keep his hct > 25.
Cardiology was consulted regarding the safety of stopping anticoagulation with a St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] mechanical valve present.
They concluded that the risk of restarting anticoagulation would clearly have to be weighed against the risk of bleeding, but that 3-4 days off anticoagulation would not lead to excessive risk.
The patient's heparin was restarted in the evening of his third day off anticoagulation, and the pt had no evidence of bleeding for the rest of his hospital stay.
Renal was consulted regarding the patient's acute renal failure, which was thought to be secondary to acute tubular necrosis as a consequence of transient hypoperfusion of the remaining kidney either intraoperatively or postoperatively during his bleeding episode.
He did not require dialysis during this hospitalization.
After heparin was restarted and the patient's hct was noted to be stable with a therapeutic PTT, the pt was transferred from the ICU to the floor.
The remainder of his hospital course was uncomplicated, and involved restarting coumadin to reach a therapeutic INR of 2.5-3.5.
This required coumadin doses of 7.5 mg PO qhs to eventually reach an INR of 2.5 upon [**Date Range **].
The patient's primary care physician was [**Name (NI) 653**], who recommended discharging the patient on his home coumadin dose (3.0) with a plan to follow-up with the pt's PCP three days later for an INR check and coumadin dose adjustment.
Steri strips with benzoin were applied and dry gauze was applied.
Before he was [**First Name (STitle) **], new steri strips were applied to the extent of his wound.
