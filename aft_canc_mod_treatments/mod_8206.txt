She was treated with cefepime for acinetobacter and completed a 2 week course of this.
She was also treated with flagyl for C.diff until 14 days after she completed other antibiotics.
She required 20 liters of IV fluids and a prolonged period of vasopressors (~ 25 days) for hypotension, but eventually was weaned in the setting of care being deescalated and transferred from the MICU to the medical floor.
r.  # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Her respiratory failure was multifactorial including pneumonia as discussed above on a baseline of severe interstitial lung disease (ILD--with dead space 78%) and then pulmonary edema from the extensive fluid resuscitation needed for sepsis.
She was intubated with endotracheal tube for ~ 30 days in the MICU.
The family repeatedly refused tacheostomy and ultimately decided that she would be terminally extubated.
She was treated with IV lasix drip and transitioned to daily IV lasix to maintain her respiratory ease.
After extubation, she was able to maintain her oxygen saturations on relatively low levels of supplementary oxygen, however, her blood gases continued to show elevated PCO2 concentrations.
Ultimately, the family elected to make her "comfort measures only" with the exception of fluids PRN and no more aggressive measures were pursued for her respiratory failure.
This was a multifactorial problem including electrolyte derangements, infection, and also concern for hypercarbia.
Patient also with evolving j-point elevation on EKG, reviewed with cardiology who felt that ST elevation in the setting of LBBB, does not meet Sgarbossa's criteria.
She was treated with aspirin and a statin for most of her ICU stay until she was extubated and lost OG tube access for oral medications.
She was tried on an amiodarone drip but this did not control the afib.
Later, she was started on digoxin which did control her rate very well and she did not have episodes of hypotension.
# Hypernatremia: After the OG tube was removed at the time of intubation, Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 40643**] developed hypernatremia to the mid 150s due to absence of oral intake and inability to drink to thirst.
She was corrected with IV D5W.
Her family continued to refuse a feeding tube as they felt it inconsistent with her goals of care.
It was stated clearly to the family that she would not be a candidate for re-intubation and that leaving her intubated without a tracheostomy for so long was injurious to her.
Also, they understood that she was not safe to eat on her own but they asserted that a feeding tube would not be something that the patient would have wanted.
When the pressors were finally weaned, the family agreed that it would not make sense for her to have further resuscitation efforts in the future including CPR, pressors, and cardioversion.
The patient was made CMO care with the exception that fluids would be given for hydration purposes.
