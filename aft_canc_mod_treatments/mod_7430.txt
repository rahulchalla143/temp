Blood and urine cultures were drawn, and patient was given doses of vancomycin, Zosyn, and levofloxacin in addition to 1 liter of intravenous saline prior to admission.
He was also given metoprolol 5 mg IV x3 followed by 25 mg orally for AF with RVR to 150.
During that admission, he was found to have a multifocal legionella pneumonia for which he was treated empirically with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin.
He was ultimately treated with a 14-day course of levofloxacin when cultures returned (finished [**12-14**]).
The hospital course was complicated by AF with RVR, and although patient was started on amiodorone and digoxin initially, as he clinically improved it was decided to stop these two medicines in favor of uptitrating his beta-blocker.
He was discharged on 50 mg of metoprolol succinate, once daily.
He then started R-CHOP in [**Month (only) 1096**] and finished a burst of prednisone on day prior to admission - Transitional cell carcinoma of bladder in [**2099**] - Atrial fibrillation on coumadin - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - Glaucoma - Paget's disease - Gout - Peripheral vascular disease - Degenerative joint disease - ECG with known LAFB, RBBB since [**9-14**] or prior   Social History: Lives with his wife and daughter in [**Location (un) 686**].

# Atrial fibrillation: During his most recent admission, patient had been treated transiently with amiodorone and digoxin, although both of these medications were discontinued at time of discharge.
As his clinical status improved, he responded well to beta-blockade.
Also received acute dosing of IV metorpolol as well as diltiazem.
The patient underwent a digoxin load prior to transfer out of the ICU, and was then transitioned to 0.125 digoxin daily.
His warfarin was held during the pancytopenia early in the admission, but was gradually restarted, and will be followed as an outpatient.
Received one dose of levofloxacin then empricially started on vancomycin and cefepime.
Vancomycin was discontinued, but the patient was continued on cefeipime while he was neutropenic.
Urine cultures were positive for presumed E.Coli, and antibiotics were later tapered based on the culture data.
