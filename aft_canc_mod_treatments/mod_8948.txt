He was started on a protonix gtt, tylenol x1 for h/a, 1L NS, and was written for 2units pRBC which he has not received yet.
Plan was to admit to MICU for further work up of GI bleed, likely colonoscopy in the AM, and to start heparin gtt when INR<2.
Of note, patient states that he recently had an asthma flare, requiring frequent albuterol rescue inhalers as well as steroid taper.
He had an EGD that was normal, and was discharged with a plan for capsule endoscopy as an outpatient.

# Gastrointestinal bleed: Given FFP and vitamin K at OSH, prior to transfer.
Patient was stablized with 2 units of pRBCs at [**Hospital1 18**], and remained hemodynamically stable throughout the admission.
This was felt to be due to chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, likely from anticoagulation and multiple AVMs, worsened acutely by significant GI bleed.
The patient received 2units of pRBCs on admission.
He was restarted on his home iron supplementation once work up for GI bleed was complete.
Plan is for patient for have a repeat colonoscopy in the next 6-12months off warfarin and bridged with lovenox.
# Aortic Valve Replacement: S/p [**Hospital3 **] prosthetic valve, on Coumadin at home, and supratherapeutic INR on presentation to OSH (which often fluctuates, per patient).
Cardiology was consulted and felt that given valve location (aortic) and type (bileaflet), it was appropriate not bridge with heparin and permit INR to drift down in setting of a GI bleed, with the thought that once the INR was <1.7, we could start a heparin drip if still concerned for bleeding.
Given the patient was stable x2days without further signs of bleeding, he was restarted on his home dose of warfarin on HD#2.
He was discharged with a Levonox bridge given subtherapeutic INR of 1.6.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will resume warfarin management and the patient was instructed to have his INR checked 2 and 5 days post-discharge.
His lasix was not restarted on discharge, as he did not appear to be requiring it.
# Asthma: Recent exacerbation, s/p prednisone taper.
We discontinued the Lasix given clinical stability and no signs of volume overload 2.
Patient will need continued outpatient management of his INR and warfarin dosing, as well as a follow up CBC which will be drawn on [**2187-4-9**] and faxed to his PCP.
