Occlusion in mid M1 segment of left MCA.
<br>  Angiogram [**2153-7-10**]: FINDINGS: Right common carotid artery arteriogram demonstrates normal filling of the right common carotid artery and its branches.
The right internal carotid artery fills well along the cervical, petrous, cavernous and supraclinoid portion.
The left common carotid artery arteriogram status post stenting shows occlusion of the left M1 by thrombus.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 4469**] was taken from the ED after receiving IV tPA to the angiography suite for intra-arterial intervention.
He had a stent placed to open the high-grade thrombotic stenosis of the Left Common Carotid.
As this had largely disappeared on the follow-up CT 12 hours later, this was attributed to the latter, and he was started on aspirin 325 daily and Plavix 75 daily.
He was kept on Insulin sliding scale and Tylenol prn temp > 100.4.
He was soon resumed on cellcept and a reduced dose of cyclosporin (50 mg [**Hospital1 **], rather than 75 mg [**Hospital1 **]) while in house; he was continued on his other medications as scheduled.
He received a stress dose of steroids in the ICU, and was tapered to 15 mg q am and 10 mg q pm at the direction of oncology.
He was directed to continue this dosing of prednisone until an appointment with oncology four days after discharge.
