Admission Date:  [**2163-8-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-8-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2103-3-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1363**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status, DKA  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 60 year old gentleman with history of metastatic melanoma to the brain and the liver, on decadron (higher dose compared to prior admission; from 4 mg q 6 hr to 6 mg q 6 hr given gradual weakness), presented with progressive worsening.
Patient is not on chemotherapy or radiation therapy at this time.
He was receiving treatment from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 3278**], including gamma-knife in [**2163-3-10**], and had multiple similar admissions in [**Month (only) **] and [**Month (only) 205**] for confusion that improved with pulse dexamethasone.
Attempts to wean steroids were met with worsening confusion.
He follows in the biologics clinic here, receiving off-label ipilimumab.
He received a huge bolus of dexamethasone (10mg at home, 10IV in the ED) with improvement of his confusion, however his FSG ascended into the 400s requiring insulin coverage.
They remained elevated in the 300 range at the time of discharge- and he was sent out on metformin with FSG testing supplies, and an appointment with his [**Name8 (MD) 6435**] NP was established within a few days of discharge to assess the need for insulin.
He was treated with an insulin gtt, aggressive hydration, and repletion of electrolytes.
His gap subsequently closed and  basal/bolus SubQ insulin was started, guided by [**Last Name (un) **] consult.
FSG were still intermittently into the 300-400 range, and glargine was uptitrated as needed.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations.
He [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1834**] gamma knife treatment to three brain lesions on [**2162-4-9**] with brain MRI one month later revealing stability.
He began off protocol ipilimumab on [**2162-6-1**].
He [**Month (only) 1834**] Gamma knife therapy to 5 lesions on [**2163-4-9**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Status post traumatic neck injury in [**2160**] after falling off a ladder, status post C-spine fusion; 2. history of chronic dysphagia from nutcracker esophagus syndrome; 3. history of a frozen shoulder status post physical therapy with improvement in mobility 4. history of lentigo maligna of the right cheek.
artifact/real correlate with MRI for better assessment if not CI.
Fullness in both hila and the paratracheal regions of the mediastinum could be due to vascular engorgement or lymph node enlargement.
Stimulation of the right ulnar nerve, recording ADM, pre- and post-10 seconds of maximal voluntary contraction demonstrated no post-exercise facilitation.
THYROID ULTRASOUND [**2163-8-18**] FINDINGS:  The right thyroid lobe measures 1.5 x 1.9 x 4.5 cm and contains a well-circumscribed, avascular, hypoechoic nodule measuring 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm in the middle portion of the thyroid lobe.
The findings are concerning for infection, including fungal, and septic emboli.
While these may represent markedly increased melanoma metastases, reassessment after treatment for infection is recommended.
Patient was started on insulin drip in the ED, his anion gap decreased from 34 on admission to 17 by the time he was on the floor.
His mental status improved within several hours of insulin therapy and he became responsive to questioning.
At [**Last Name (un) **] recommendation, patient's insulin titrated to 30U qAM and 25U qHS of Lantus, as well as QACHS sliding scale, with improved blood sugar control.
If steroid wean not feasible, PCP prophylaxis will have to be started.
Patient was started on thyroid hormone replacement and testosterone replacement.
No mineralocorticoid replacement was indicated at this time.
His CXR at that time reflected a possible multilobar pneumonia which was broadly covered as HCAP with vancomycin and cefepime.
Despite being advised to stay and continue work-up, they chose to go home on levofloxacin on [**2163-8-21**].

You were treated with insulin, fluids and electrolytes, and this resolved.
