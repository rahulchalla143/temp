INDICATION: Patient has previous laparoscopic feeding jejunostomy tube placed approximately four months previous.
The tube has been removed, yet needs to be replaced given need for tube feeding since nutritional requirements are not met.
FINDINGS/PROCEDURE: Informed consent was obtained after the risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure were explained.
Fluoroscopy was used to identify the surgically placed staples indicating the site of jejunal loop tacking to the anterior peritoneal surface.
A guidewire followed by Kumpe catheter was used to secure placement into the jejunal loop.
An Amplatz wire secured this site and provides stiffness for dilation of the tract.
A 12 French Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 12433**] jejunostomy tube was secured in the jejunal loop and the guidewire was removed.
The feeding tube was sutured to the skin.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
20 cc buffered lidocaine was administered for local anesthesia.
IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound and fluoroscopic-guided placement of 12 french jejunostomy tube.

[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7722**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7723**] Approved: TUE [**2147-6-6**] 12:07 PM  HISTORY: 54-year-old man status post esophagectomy with persistent ileus, please inject p.o.
TECHNIQUE: 5-mm contiguous axial images from the thoracic inlet through the lesser trochanters without IV and with Gastrografin which was injected via the J-tube were obtained.
Correlation is made to a prior abdominal ultrasound dated [**2147-5-25**] as well as a prior PET scan dated [**2147-1-10**].
Ground-glass opacities are seen in the right greater than left lungs.
The patient is status post esophagectomy with gastric pull-through.
Oral contrast is admixed with gastric pull-through fluid.
Mild atherosclerotic disease is seen in the thoracic aorta and coronary arteries.
A surgical drain tracks along the left aspect of the neck into the mediastinum to the level of the distal trachea.
Liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and right kidney appear normal.
Surgical staples are seen in the upper abdomen from the patient's recent esophagectomy and gastric pull-through.
This study was performed with Gastrografin injection into the J-tube per the referring team's request.
Preliminary son[**Name (NI) 493**] images of the abdomen demonstrate a moderate amount of ascites, with the largest pocket within the right lower quadrant, which was chosen for percutaneous access.
1% lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, without immediate post-procedural complications.
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound-guided diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis, yielding 1.5 liters of tan-colored ascites.
Fluoroscopic images of the esophagogastric anastomosis were obtained.
A surgical drain is noted overlying the mediastinum in addition to pacemaker leads.

The patient was administered MAC anesthesia.
The procedure was not difficult.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
The fluid was removed with suction.
A 10mm balloon was introduced for dilation and the diameter was progressively increased to 15 mm successfully.
Subsequently, 5 ml (100 Units) of Botox was injected in and around the pylorus.

Recommendations: NPO Follow for response/complications Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]  Additional notes: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the ERCP fellow.
The patient's reconciled home medication list is appended to this report.
On POD 0, overnight, he went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate which was controlled with diltiazem drip.
He required a large amount of oxygen to keep his saturation up.
On POD 3 he was diuresed with lasix which he responded to well.
This was continued on POD 4 as well, with good response when he was restarted on lovenox and given aggressive lasix diuresis.
On POD 7 his chest tube was discontinued and a clonidine patch and lopressor were added.
TPN was started on POD 8 and he had an ECHO which was unremarkable.
On POD 9 lopressor was increased and on POD 10 he was persistantly tachycardic so a diltiazem drip was started.
fevers he was started on flagyl/zosyn/vanc/fluc.
On [**6-1**] he was started on levaquin for presumptive pneumonia.
On [**6-2**] he underwent a J tube in IR and his diltiazem drip was changed to J-tube medications.
On [**6-6**] he underwent a renal usg for increased creatinine which was essentialy normal, though he remained distended.
He was discontinued off levo/flagyl on [**6-8**].
On [**6-10**] EP was consulted and he was started on digoxin for refractory atrial fibrillation.
On [**6-15**] he was started on tubefeeds slowly.
His tubefeeds were held and then restarted multiple times.
Given continued output from his JP drain each time he had a small amount of retching, it was assumed that he had a leak in his esophageal anastamosis, despite a drain study in radiology that had indicated otherwise.
He was noted to have continued bouts of small amounts of emesis vs. regurgitation which sometimes would have increased output in his L neck JP drain.
On  [**6-25**] roughly 600cc was emptied from a JP drain and he underwent EGD for presumptive pyloric stenosis.
In this EGD his pyloris was dilated and injected with botox and his symptoms improved signficantly.
Prior to discharge all of his medications were switched to J tube with good effect.
He will be discharged on a soft solid diet with explicit warning about certain signs of collection / fevers.
