Of note they report that she has been having cocaine induced "seizures" over the past year but never sought medical attention.
Cocaine and heroin were found at the site, with the needle still present.
EMS arrived after about 20 minutes at which time she was intubated for airway protection.
She was brought to OSH and received ativan 6mg, was loaded on fosphenytoin 1gram and PB 500mg.
She was febrile (103) and her tox screen was positive for benzo, cocaine, methadone and cannabis.
To obtain a head CT, she received vecuronium as she was apparently still seizing.
She was on pressors for a short time for hypotension.
Tylenol, vanco, CTX given; started on versed gtt.
NS bolus 1.25 liters; acyclovir 600mg IV x 1. .
Pt was followed by the neurology team who initially felt that her seizures were due to substance toxicity, however, after review of EEG, felt that there may be an aspect of epileptiform changes.
She was initially on broad spectrum antibiotics, but after CSF showed no meningitis and all other cultures remained negative, these were discontinued.
She was never febrile after this, and wbc count remained normal, and so antibiotics were not re-started.

[**2164-12-22**] CXR: ET tube 4cm above carina.
The generally slowed background and suppressed background would be suggestive of medication effect.
[**12-24**] CXR IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-21**] through 26: Mild vascular congestion and small regions of peribronchial opacification have developed at the lung bases since [**12-23**] and may represent volume overload and early pneumonia, respectively.
ET tube tip at the thoracic inlet.
Nasogastric tube looped in the stomach.
IMPRESSION: Two subcutaneous nodules as described above, which confirm the palpatory findings.
Pateint required ICU stay and prolonged hospital stay for management of social issues.
[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]: Her Status Eiplipticus stopped after dilantin load.
She was continued on dilatin per neurology as she was thought to be prone to seizures from childhood febrile seizure.
Her transaminitis was thought to be [**3-1**] massive drug use, and trended down with IV fluids.
Likely secondary to hypotension in setting of status epilepticus superimposed on underlying HepB sAb and cAb positive.
She was medically stable and at one time was treated with an anti-fungal for vaginal pruritus.
