HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53-year-old woman, with past medical history most notable for advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer, who underwent cystic duct stenting in [**2154-11-25**], and received Xeloda chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
She states that after completing the course of chemotherapy and radiation, she has appreciated several episodes of hematochezia, the last being 3 days prior to presentation, and approximately 3 tbsp in volume/episode, and there are 3-5 episodes/day.
She received 3 liters of normal saline volume resuscitation, as well as 1 unit of packed red blood cells.

INITIAL LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Hemoglobin 6.5, hematocrit 24.4, platelets 277.
She then underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy which revealed an actively bleeding gastric ulcer that underwent epinephrine injection on [**2154-12-31**] with good hemostasis.
Hematocrit following the procedure remained stable for 2 days.
Attempts at electrocautery and epinephrine injection did not limit the bleeding significantly, and at the time of this dictation serial hematocrit checks were continuing.
Owing to the patient's poor nutrition, a percutaneously inserted central catheter was placed, and total parenteral nutrition was administered without complications.
Once the patient's hemodynamic status was stabilized, furosemide and spironolactone were added to her medications to relieve the peripheral edema, specifically to decrease the swelling in her legs and the ascites.
