10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..         Brief Hospital Course: This is a 82 year old male with bladder cancer requiring 4 resections and recently diagnosed metastatic squamous cell cancer involving the rectum.
He was admitted following a Right portacath placement.
He was NPO with NGT and started on TPN for nutritional support.
He had a NGT clamp trial and the NGT was removed on HD 5.
He continued to complain of intermittent nausea and received Zofran.
He was started on Erythromycin for GI motility.
Patient was evaluated by GI for placement of PEG tube for decompression and eventually to Rehab facility with TPN.
This attempt was unsuccessful ([**6-19**]) and while receiving the procedure, NTG was removed with suspected aspiration.
In ICU, pt was treated for suspected aspiration PNA, with flagyl/levo (started on [**2144-6-20**]), received lasix 20mg IV with -1L response overnight.
His coumadin was restarted and INR was 2.2 on [**6-21**].
Patient was weaned from NC O2 to room air with saturations of > 94%.
Patient was continued on TPN starting on [**2144-6-23**].
His NGT was removed on [**2144-6-26**] as patient was able to tolerate 250 cc PO the day prior.
The next steps for this patient are anticipated to be increasing PO intake and weaning off TPN hydration.
# Bladder cancer requiring 4 resections and recently diagnosed metastatic squamous cell cancer involving the rectum.
A consultation was obtained for possible radiation therapy and this was not deemed to be a viable option due to the extent of the disease.
Patient's functional status will be re-evaluated prior to chemotherapy to ensure that he is fit for this treatment modality.
# Elevated INR: INR continued to be elevated despite administration of Vitamin K.  A hematology consult was obtained.
They felt the possible causes of the patient's elevated coagulation studies include Coumadin overdose, malnutrition, and excessive heparin response; less likely possibilities include liver failure and acquired coagulation factor deficiencies.
The fact that the PT was elevated to a much greater degree than the PTT points to warfarin effect and/or and vitamin K deficiency.
- No further VitK administration at this time as INR normalized following IV VitK.
With this regimen, patient's INR became subtherapeutic and pt was restarted on 5mg of coumadin QD.
Due to erroneous adminstration of vitamin K in TPN, patient's INR again became subtherapeutic on [**6-23**].
He was given a dose of 7.5mg of coumadin and vitamin K was held from TPN.
Patient's coumadin was withheld during those dates.
His INR should be monitored and coumadin regimen adjusted to ensure target of 2 - 3.
Once the INR stabilized, he was restarted on his Coumadin dose and his INR was monitored closely (please see above for anticoagulation discussion).
Patient was continued on Lasix 40mg QD.
This regimen may require an increase to 40 [**Hospital1 **] or IV lasix to improve pedal edema as patient has been volume even over [**6-23**] - [**6-26**].
Nutrition:  Patient was started on TPN on [**2144-6-11**], which was stopped [**1-11**] respiratory distress and was restarted on [**6-22**].
Of note, TPN should not include vitamin K as patient is on warfarin.
TPN formula is listed shown below: 2000cc, AA 85, Dextrose 325, Fat 50; No trace elements, No vitamin K, NaCL 0, NaAc 50, NaPO4 20, KCl 40, KAc 45, KPO4 0, MgSO4 15, CaGluc 15, no heparin, famotidine, Insulin 20 U, Zinc 10mg, cycled over 12 hours.
Atrial fibrillation - patient was rate controlled on Metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID.
Thus Vancomycin 1g Q24hrs (renally adjusted) was started.
Tachy/brady syndrome s/p pacer - patient was V paced at 70. .
Functional status - physical therapy evaluation and treatment were performed.
His UTI treatment shoud be continued and followed.

A meeting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] oncologist, has also been set up for you, to evaluate whether you will be able to undergo a palliative chemotherapy treatment.
