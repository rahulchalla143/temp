Right subclavian CV line has tip located in region of cavoatrial junction.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 yoM with h/o esophgeal CA, variceal bleed, HCC s/p recent chemoembolization presents s/p syncopal episode w/BRBPR and melena.
DDx also included PUD, gastric AVM, portal gastropathy, small bowel neoplasm, diverticular bleed, colonic AVM, hematobilia (given recent chemoembolization).
Hct was fairly stable after receiving 9 units of PRBCs and 3 Units FFP, though the patient did get one more unit of PRBCs after transfer to the medical floor for hct<28.
He was continued on IV protonix [**Hospital1 **] and octreotide gtt initially, and an attempt was made at banding his varices though this was not successful secondary to an esoph stricture that limited passage of the banding device.
He responded well to lasix while in the unit, and was continued on Lasix 40mg po qd while on the floor with a goal -1L/day until he became volume contracted.
Of note, he was 13L positive after agressive resuscitation in MICU.
His wheezing went away after diuresis and subsequent paracentesis.
ARF: Cr 5.1 on admit from baseline 0.7 [**2199-3-6**], felt to be primarily prerenal with drop to 0.6 after volume resuscitation.
Coagulopathy: may be secondary to Vit K deficiency (given poor PO intake), decreased synthetic function given HCC and recent chemoembolization, massive transfusion of PRBC.
Cont Vit K 5 mg SC X 3 days, gave FFP x 3 while in unit to correct INR to <1.4.
All sedating meds were held initially, his mental status cleared, and then low dose (5mg) Ambien was used as needed to help him sleep, at the patient's request.
Gave thiamine and folate.
Monitored closely for evidence of withdrawal with Ativan prn CIWA scale but no evid of withdrawal while in house.
He has also made it clear that he does not want extreme measures to be taken if the cause of his demise is irreversible.
He is agreeable to intubation and cardioversion only if there is a strong chance of recovery.
If it is known that his emobolization procedure is ineffective and there is nothing else that can be done to save his liver the family is comfortable with taking him home and making him comfortable.
