Mild increase in the size of the left CP angle mass lesion felt to represent vestibular schwannoma, with blood products within.
Areas of blood products in the CP angle region, anterior to the medulla, and in the posterior fossa relate to the recently noted subdural/subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Continued evolution of the blood products, noted in the CSF space, anterior and to the left side of the medulla and in the upper cervical canal with mild decrease in the anteroposterior extent of the blood products as seen on the sagittal images; improvemed but persistent compression on the upper cervical cord and the left side of the medulla compared to the prior study (but persistent).
Improving extra-axial hemorrhage.
Left-sided cerebellopontine angle mass consistent with vestibular schwannoma is identified which demonstrates intrinsic area of blood products as seen on the previous CT. Limited comparison with the previous MRI demonstrate no significant change in size when comparing the differences in technique.
Cerebral angiography showed prominent venous/vascular structures in the region of the proximal V4 segment of the left vertebral artery may represent a developmental venous anomaly/venous angioma, but hypervascular tumor cannot be excluded.
