SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY:  DIAGNOSIS: INVOLVEMENT BY ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA WITH MONOCYTIC DIFFERENTIATION, SEE NOTE.
Erythrocytes appear decreased in number and are normochromic with anisopoikilocytosis, including dacryocytes and ovalocytes.
-------------------INTERPHASE FISH ANALYSIS, 100-300 CELLS-------------------  nuc ish(D8Z2x2),(MLLx2)[100] FISH evaluation for a MLL rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the LSI MLL Dual Color, Break Apart Probe (Vysis) at 11q23 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
A normal MLL FISH finding can result from absence of a MLL rearrangement, from a variant MLL rearrangement, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
FISH evaluation for a chromosome 8 aneuploidy was performed with the Vysis CEP 8 DNA Probe (chromosome 8 alpha satellite DNA) at 8p11.1-q11.1 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
Two hybridization signals were detected in 95/100 nuclei examined, which is within the normal range (up to 6%) for this probe in our laboratory.
A normal chromosome 8 FISH finding can result from absence of trisomy for chromosome 8 or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
[**Numeric Identifier 60209**]  ATYPICAL MOLE RLQ (ABD), RE-EXC DYSPLASTIC MOLE LLQ (and more)    SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY:  DIAGNOSIS:  Markedly hypocellular marrow (less than 5% cellular), status post chemotherapeutic ablation.
Erythrocytes appear decreased in number, are mildly hypochromic with anisopoikilocytosis including bite cells, echinocytes, acanthocytes, dacrocytes, and microcytes.
Aspirate Smear: The aspirate material is adequate and consists of several hypocellular spicules composed of stromal cells, histiocytes, plasma cells, and lymphocytes.
Hemosiderin laden macrophages are present.
Overall cellularity is less than 5%, and consists largely of plasma cells and lymphocytes.
The remainder is composed of stromal cells, macrophages, and background eosinophilic material consistent with ablative chemotherapy.
-------INTERPHASE FISH ANALYSIS, 100-300 CELLS---------   nuc ish(ETO,AML1)x2[100] FISH evaluation for an AML1-ETO rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the LSI AML1/ETO Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for ETO at 8q22 and AML1 at 21q22 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
No rearrangement was observed in 98/100 nuclei, which is within the normal range (up to 1% dual rearrangement and 3% technical artifact) for this probe in our laboratory.
A normal finding can result from absence of an AML1-ETO rearrangement, from a variant AML1-ETO rearrangement, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
Approximately 6% of total analyzed events co-express CD4, CD56, CD33, CD14 and CD15.
# Acute Monoblastic Leukemia: presented with one week of muscle aches, neck tenderness, several bruises, and fever, found to have WBC 233,000, and bone marow biopsy showing acute monoblastic leukemia (FAB subtype M5a) with monocytic differentiation.
Treated with 7+3 regimen (cytarabine and idarubicin) with significant complications of prolonged neutropenic fever, typhlitis, mucositis, all discussed separately.
No source of infection was initially found, and she was empirically treated initially with vancomycin, cefepime and fluconazole but continued to spike.
She was treated with a 14 day course of daptomycin which was continued via PICC line at the time of discharge to run through [**2187-3-12**].
CT abdomen/pelvis significant for colonic wall thickening/edema suggestive of typhilitis in the setting of treatment for AML.
Surgery consulted however no surgical intervention appropriate.
Treated with bowel rest, IVF, TPN, and continued antibiotics, as well as glutamine and antiemetics.
Treated with Caphosol, Gelclair, acyclovir and morphine PCA.
# Hypertension: Patient with a history of hypertension on atenolol and lisinopril at home.
Lisinopril was initially held due to the risk of renal failure during the initial treatement course and atenolol was switched to [**Hospital1 **] metoprolol due to ease of dosing control.
Her pressures normalized during the final three days of her hospitalization with amlodipine on top of an increased doses of her home beta blocker and her regular home lisinopril.
On admission she underwent leukopheresis and was started on hydroxyurea and allopurinol.
Her WBC decreased acutely after leukopheresis but then began to rapidly increase, and then came down with further hydroxyurea.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Developed hypoxic respiratory distress [**2-13**] fluid overload in context of significant IVF given for ARF and DIC previous mentioned.
