[**6-25**] LENI FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed.
Endotracheal tube is terminating 4 cm above the carina.
NG tube is extending below the diaphragm and out of the field of view.
Multiple large sternotomy wires are noted with no complications.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 yo M with PMH of CAD s/p CABG, atrial fibrillation, diastolic dysfunction, COPD here for evaluation of GI bleed who developed respiratory distress requiring intubation along with cardiac arrest following enteroscopy.
# Acute Respiratory Failure: Pt underwent an enteroscopy and colonoscopy for recurrent GI bleeding, following the procedure the patient developed acute respiratory distress requiring intubation.
The patient required intubation overnight, respiratory status quickly improved following diuresis.
The patient received one dose of vancomycin and cefepime after spiking a fever following intubation with a question of aspiration on CXR.
Vanc/cefepime was tapered to levaquin on [**6-25**].
Antibiotics were discontined on [**6-25**] as pt became afebrile and was without evidence of infiltrate on CXR.
He received CPR and was given epinephrine.
He was weaned from mechanical ventilation as above.
He was given a single dose of IV lasix for acute respiratory decompensation and diuresed 1L.
Further diuresis was held and Cr trended down to 2.4 prior to discharge.
# History of chronic GI bleed: The patient presented for colonoscopy and enteroscopy to evaluate GI bleeding.
He also had a gastric polyps removed and underwent AVM cauderizations.
He was restarted on aspirin and imdur.
Given unclear etiology of arrest and new RV dysfunction the patient should undergo further ischemic workup as outpatient.
He was off coumadin given GI procedure but this was restarted on day of discharge.
