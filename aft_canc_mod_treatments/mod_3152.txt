Admission Date:  [**2161-3-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2161-3-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2094-3-14**]       Sex:  M  Service: Medicine  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Pulmonary embolism found incidentally on a routine staging CT.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66 year old male who was most recently discharged from the hospital on [**2161-3-4**].
During the past hospital admission patient underwent interventional radiology stenting for a biliary drain and had a routine staging chest CT prior to discharge.
Patient was then started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation for the pulmonary embolism and admitted to the medicine service.
He denies chest pain, cough, fever, hemoptysis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Benign gastric cancer, status post partial gastrectomy in [**2142**].
Status post right inguinal hernia repair and left inguinal hernia repair.
Right knee surgery for a question of cartilage problems, status post surgery.
Recently diagnosed pancreatic cancer with liver metastasis, status post biliary stent placement and intervention.
CT of the chest inferior posterior margin of pericardium with a 7 to 8 mm nodular density.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 66 year old white male with a history of recently diagnosed pancreatic cancer who was called back to [**Hospital1 18**] for pulmonary embolism which was found incidentally on a routine staging CT.  As there is no contraindication for anticoagulation (negative head CT, guaiac negative stools), patient was started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation.
Patient was started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation and was then subsequently changed to Lovenox.
Patient as well as his wife received teaching on Lovenox administration.
Driver) came and evaluated patient again and felt that the best anticoagulation therapy would be Lovenox.
They felt that once his bilirubin normalized, treatment options would include weekly intravenous therapy with gemcitabine or oral therapy with capecitabine.
Due to his high bilirubin and the potential interactions of Coumadin with capecitabine, the oncology consult recommended dosing of enoxaparin (Lovenox) instead of Coumadin as anticoagulation.
Patient wished to receive treatment on [**Location (un) **] and Doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **]/Driver referred him to a local oncologist in [**Hospital1 1562**].
IR felt that patient needed additional biliary stenting at a later point in time.
On [**2161-3-7**] biliary drainage turned bloody with some clots in the drainage bag.
There was a question of whether this was secondary to tumor bleeding, possible liver bleeding with anticoagulation or possible tube track-communication to the portal branch of one of the vessels.
There were small amounts of bloody drainage in his biliary bag.
It appeared that there was no output from the stent and that the biliary drainage catheter was obstructed.
Since patient was afebrile, hemodynamically stable and there began to be minimal output from his biliary drain, it was decided that patient would be closely watched overnight and if there were any problems, patient would be started on empiric antibiotic therapy.
In addition, Lovenox was discontinued on [**2161-3-8**] in the a.m. after patient had episodes of bloody clots in his bag.
There was extreme concern for infection given that his biliary stent appeared to be occluded.
Blood cultures times two were drawn, patient began to be aggressively hydrated with fluids and patient was started on empiric ampicillin/levofloxacin/Flagyl for triple antibiotic coverage.
Patient was hydrated very aggressively with 3 to 4 liters of normal saline and still had decreased urine output.
In the MICU a left subclavian central axis line as well as an arterial line were placed.
He was hydrated aggressively with IV fluids (normal saline) as he appeared to be intravascularly depleted with low blood pressure, tachycardia and decreased urine output.
His antibiotics were continued (ampicillin/levofloxacin/Flagyl).
Therefore, in the MICU patient's anticoagulation was restarted with a heparin drip.
On [**2161-3-10**] biliary drainage remained patent.
On [**2161-3-11**] the patient's biliary catheter drainage tube became clogged again.
Biliary catheter appeared to be obstructed by a blood clot.
Interventional radiology came and examined the bag and it was flushed, but it still did not drain.
Patient's heparin was discontinued and patient was taken to interventional radiology for a tube check (cholangiogram) to check for effective drainage.
On [**2161-3-11**] interventional radiology changed the biliary catheter and additionally identified a fistulous tract.
Additionally, blood cultures that were drawn on [**2161-3-9**] returned as Enterococcus with sensitivities and identifications still pending.
Patient's coags were checked and INR was between 1.8 to 2.0, so he was not started on heparin and not started on Lovenox.
There was hesitancy to anticoagulate this patient to run the risk of causing rebleeding, reocclusion and reinfection.
Bilirubin continued to decrease.
Levofloxacin was discontinued as the sensitivities from the cultures were back.
It was Enterococcus faecalis sensitive to ampicillin and resistant to levofloxacin as well as some synergy with streptomycin.
Adding streptomycin in addition to ampicillin as well as Flagyl was considered, however, it was decided against secondary to the severe potential toxicity related to streptomycin.
On [**3-16**] through [**3-17**] patient's biliary drainage was capped by interventional radiology.
A Lovenox trial was initiated, in treatment of his pulmonary embolism.
The thought was that if patient rebled on Lovenox, patient would require an IVC filter for prevention of future pulmonary emboli.
The patient tolerated Lovenox well during the two day trial.
Only the internal stent remained.
Patient tolerated the procedure quite well.
A PICC line was placed on the right side for IV antibiotics times 10 days.
Patient is to continue IV antibiotics (ampicillin only) for a 10 day treatment.
He was initially started on a heparin drip and subsequently switched to Lovenox.
At various points throughout the admission patient was either on heparin or Lovenox, but these were sometimes held, as above.
Coumadin was not recommended as a form of anticoagulation secondary to his high bilirubin and the potential interactions with Coumadin and capecitabine, should patient decide to pursue chemotherapy.
Patient's discharge medication is Lovenox 90 mg subcu q.12 hours.
[**Name (NI) **] wife had Lovenox teaching and she administered Lovenox to patient with ease.
In addition, patient had anemia secondary to acute blood loss requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells.
The patient was placed on IV famotidine while he was not eating well.
Biliary obstruction and jaundice, status post percutaneous drain placement/common bile duct stenting.
Patient had numerous interventional radiology interventions as dictated above.
After patient's final intervention with his common bile duct stent on Wednesday, [**2161-3-18**], he is to have 10 days of IV antibiotics (ampicillin).
The patient had IV fluids at 125 cc an hour for rehydration purposes while patient had decreased appetite.
There was a question of whether this was secondary to IV Flagyl.
IV Flagyl was discontinued on [**2161-3-19**].
Hopefully, patient will have an increase in his appetite.
It was decided that IV Flagyl was not necessary and that the primary antibiotic would be ampicillin to target Enterococcus.
The patient had a right PICC line placed for IV antibiotics times 10 days.
The patient was given morphine IV/subcu p.r.n.
The patient has pancreatic cancer (adenocarcinoma) with liver metastasis.
Tolerating Lovenox well.
External biliary drain has been pulled and patient only has an internal drain with his common bile duct stent.
Since his last manipulation/intervention was on [**2161-3-18**], he should have 10 days of IV antibiotics given his past medical history of sepsis with Enterococcus.
Status post multiple interventional radiology interventions on the common bile duct stenting/biliary system.
Anemia secondary to blood loss requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells.
Status post multiple interventional radiology interventions on the biliary system.
Status post PICC placement for IV antibiotics.
Lovenox 90 mg subcu q.12 hours (dose is 1 mg per kg, patient weighs approximately 95 kg).
Ambien 5 to 10 mg p.o.
Ativan 0.5 to 1.0 mg p.o.
Ampicillin 2 gm IV q.four hours times 10 days.
