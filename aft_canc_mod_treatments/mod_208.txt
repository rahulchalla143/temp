She tolerated surgery well with 400 cc blood loss, but had reduced urine output requiring 4l NS.
Her CXR demonstrated decreased lung volumes on left side in particular with low ET tube as well as poor visualization of left hemidaphragm indicating that hypoxia could be due to decreased ventilation of the left lung or hidden PNA.
Respiratory acidosis on ABG led to initiation of Bipap as needed.
Vancomycin and zosyn were initiated on POD#2, and ciprofloxacin was added on POD#3 for treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
She remained well oxygenated on 4L NC which was very slowly weaned off on POD#13.
The patient received IV boluses as needed to keep MAP>65.
The patient was hemodynamically stable and never required pressors while in the ICU.
Home antihypertensive medications were re-started POD#12 starting with metoprolol.
Nifedipine was added on POD#21 when blood pressures continued to be elevated on one [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
She was discharged on Metoprolol 50 mg XL daily and Nifedipine 90 mg XL daily.
Morphine PCA was instituted but later discontinued given low renal clearance.
Low dose IV Dilaudid PRN was used for pain control for the remainder of ICU stay.
Pt was kept on IV dilaudid for pain control until she was adequately tolerating POs on POD#13 and was switched to PO dilaudid and tylenol.
She was using Tylenol at time of discharge.
The patient had HD catheter placed in the left IJ and HD was initiated on POD #6.
The patient underwent hemodialysis every other day until her hemodialysis was discontinued on [**11-29**].
The patient's hemodialysis port is still in place and to be removed by interventional radiology likely on [**12-5**] or [**12-6**] when patient has INR < 2.0  5.
NG tube was placed and the patient was maintained NPO.
Given long term NPO, TPN was initiated on POD#6.
She was advanced to regular diet and TPN was discontinued on [**2154-11-21**].
This represents subclinical hypothyroidism that may be due to her multiple acute illness, including recent pneumonia, influenza A infection, and renal failure requiring dialysis.
Diabetes - Patient was on an insulin sliding scale with relatively adequate glycemic control until POD#17.
Blood sugars continued to range between 47-80s and responded only minimally to oral glucose tablets, D50 boluses and glucose gel.
With improvements in her renal function, glyburide was again restarted at 5 mg.
A heparin drip was started and bridged to coumadin.
Lovenox was not used due to patient's BMI and renal failure.
The patient was on Coumadin 5 mg daily until [**12-2**] 1600 which was her last dose.
The patient is currently off coumadin at time of discharge to reverse the patient's INR briefly for removal of tunnelled hemodialysis port catheter likely [**12-5**] or [**12-6**].
All contact precautions were discontinued prior to discharge.
Prophylaxis - Pt was kept on Subcutaneous heparin TID for DVT prophylaxis as well as pneumoboots.
She was given a proton pump inhibitor.
She was kept on kefzol per plastics recommendations for prophylaxis until her JP drains were removed.
When these antibiotics were discontinued after resolution of the pneumonia, Kefzol was again restarted and discontinued on [**2154-11-30**] when the JP drain was discontinued by plastic surgery.
Anemia: The patient received 2 units of packed RBC following surgery.
The patient was started on iron TID with colace even though iron studies did not reflect iron deficiency anemia.
