She was found to have RLL PNA on CXR and intubated in the ED for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
She was treated empirically with ceftriazone, azithromycin for CAP and Solumedrol for COPD exacerbation.
Initial ECG was notable for TWI throughout the precordium and CK and troponin peaked on HD 2 at 205, 1.21.
The patient was (+) 4.5 L, F/U CXR were suggestive of b/l effusions and her BNP peaked at 3120 so she was diuresed with lasix 40 PO bid.

She was weaned off the propofol and began to wake up.
She completed her course of antibiotics for a ?
A heparin drip was not started as it was thought that the pt was outside the appropriate window.
The patient improved dramatically on antibiotics and a steroid taper and she was extubated ten days after she was intubated.
The patient's BP was difficult to control once the propofol was weaned off and she was restarted on all of her home medications and titrated up to keep SBP < 140.
On HD #11, she was doing well on nasal cannula and transferred to the floor.
At midnight on HD #12, patient was noted to go into acute respiratory distress.
She was started on continuous nebs, 100% face mask, given Lasix 40 IV with good output (although she had been 1L neg for the day), and given a dose of morphine.
She initially was asking for re-intubation but was able to settle out and her O2 sats returned to the 90s.
Cardiology recommended cycling enzymes and placing on nitro gtt.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE - Patient was treated for LLL PNA and COPD exacerbation at OSH.
She completed 10 day course of ceftriaxone on [**4-28**] and received a course of azithro at the OSH.
She was continued on nebs and NC Oxygen throughout her admission.
Diuresis was continued with lasix 20 mg PO daily.
She was continued on a betablocker, aspirin, ACE, and statin.
COPD - She was eventually changed to her outpatient regimen of Combivent, Fluticasone, and Salmeterol inhalers.
She was also continued on a slow steroid taper at the time of discharge.
The etiology was thought to be secondary to sedating medications and narcotics.
These medications should be avoided in the future.
DIABETES - She was continued on fixed dose of NPH with an insulin sliding scale.
This increased requirement is likely due to steroid treatment and should be titrated down when appropriate.
Since HIT was suspected, heparin was discontinued and a HIT antibody was sent.
