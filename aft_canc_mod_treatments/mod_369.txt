Brief Hospital Course: # neutropenic fever - Patient presented with ANC 0 and fevers to 103 and was started on vancomycin/cefepime empirically.
As there was concern that the patient's antibiotic regimen was insufficiently covering CNS infections, he was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for an LP to be performed as well as the meropenem desensitization protocol (patient with anaphylaxis to PCN, ~1% chance of crossreactivity with meropenem).
