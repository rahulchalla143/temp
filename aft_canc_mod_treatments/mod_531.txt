Brief Hospital Course: 48 yo man with metastatic renal cell Ca, on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis, who has been weaning off dexamethasone for his cerebral metastasis and presented with a L focal seizure that secondarily generalized.
He was loaded with Dilantin and received Decadron 10 mg iv prior to transfer here on [**12-28**].
The patient was extubated [**12-29**] and had a code purple for agitation that day as well, for which he received ativan and zyprexa.
We will discharge the patient with standing seroquel 50mg at HS and an Rx for PRN seroquel as well.
He was continued on decrementing doses of dexamethasone until he was switched to prednisone 4mg daily on [**2200-1-2**].
He was stable on keppra and dilantin with no further sezures.
As such we stopped the antibiotics (bactrim) that were started briefly and checked another UA that revealed no infection.
