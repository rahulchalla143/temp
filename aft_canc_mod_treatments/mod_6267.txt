Admission Date:  [**2106-3-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-3-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2048-10-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Accupril / Naprosyn / Quinapril  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Hematemesis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: egd  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 32153**] is a 57M with a PMH of advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer, s/p gastric and biliary bypass [**5-/2105**], chemo, xrt, and s/p recent palliative small bowel bypass procedure for an SBO in 1/[**2105**].
He recieved two liters of NS, one unit of pRBCs, IV pantoprazole, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
One Peripheral IV was placed in addition to his existing portacath.
Past Medical History: # Pancreatic cancer, status-post Double bypass (Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy and gastro-enterostomy) # Diabetes Mellitus (DM) type 2 on insulin # Chronic pancreatitis # OA knees # Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) # "hole in heart" at age 8.
# Status-post tonsillectomy # Status-post shoulder surgery # Hydrocele?
s/p drainage # Status-post Vasectomy # Status-post Cholecystectomy.
He then underwent an ERCP with stent placement at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2105-5-15**] and was noted to have a stricture in the distal bile duct as well as a tortuous pancreatic duct and calcification in the pancreatic head.
EUS and needle biopsy showed an ill-defined mass in the head of the pancreas and surgery was consulted for the possibility of a local procedure, which was planned for [**2105-6-22**].
The patient underwent surgery on [**2105-6-22**], but due to the operative findings of tumor invasion of the SMV and SMA, the procedure was converted to a palliative bypass with Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy/gastroenterostomy and cholecystectomy due to the locally advanced nature of the disease.
This surgery was complicated by wound infection with gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains on culture.
A VAC dressing was placed to help with wound healing.
Since then the patient has completed clinical trial 07-299, where he was randomized to the TNFerade plus SOC arm which consists of five local injections of TNFerade biologic via EUS approach combined with continuous infusion of 5-FU Monday through Friday along with radiation.
Week 6 consisted of 5-FU and radiation therapy only.
The clinical trial ended in early [**2105-9-30**], and following this the patient began chemotherapy with gemcitabine on [**2106-10-28**], as standard of care.
Treatment with gemcitabine has been complicated by neutropenia and abdominal pain and fever due to a closed loop bowel obstruction secondary to tumor, for which the patient underwent an ex-lap with by-pass of a dilated pancreaticobiliary drainage limb on [**2106-1-18**].
Portacath in place, clean, dry, no erythema.
