Brief Hospital Course: 59 y/o M with a history of mitral valve prolapse, atrial fibrillation s/p MAZE and mitral valvuloplasty in [**10/2171**] that was complicated by a right MCA CVA and a RLE DVT presented status post fall and fracture of his left hip on [**2173-7-23**].
His hip was repaired with a L hemiarthroplasty on [**2173-7-23**], and in the post-operative setting, he had persistent high oxygen requirements.
He progressed to respiratory failure secondary to multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary edema, requiring re-intubation and transfer to the MICU.
He was treated with a 10 day course of antibiotics and aggressive diuresis, as well as vasopressors until he improved.
Following extubation from his orthopedic procedure, patient was maintained on 5L nasal canula on the floor.
He was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics (including vancomycin, and, at different points, cefepime, levofloxacin, and Meropenem).
His tachypnea increased, and he became hypoxic on BiPAP and required intubation on [**2173-7-31**].
Cultures from bronchoscopy following intubation were unremarkable, and visual inspection of the airways did not demonstate purulence.
He received a 10-day course of antibiotics for VAP coverage.
He was started on Lasix drip for diuresis, and was extubated on [**2173-8-5**].
# Hip Fracture: His hip was repaired with a L hemiarthroplasty on [**2173-7-23**].
Orthopedic surgery followed the patient throughout his stay in the MICU.
His surgical wound healed well, and staples were removed on [**2173-8-6**], there was no concern for infection.
Physical therapy began working with the patient when he was weaned off sedation prior to being extubated.
They continued working with him during the remainder of his hospitalization and recommended subacute rehab after discharge.
Before and during intubation and after extubation, the patient had pleuritic chest pain as well.
At different points during his hospitalization, his pain was controlled with morphine, fentanyl, ibuprofen, IV Tylenol, and/or lidocaine patch.
He will be discharged on tylenol and morphine prn.
The patient's home metoprolol was held in the setting of hypotension.
When the patient was extubated and his tachycardia resolved, he was restarted on metoprolol, and switched to metoprolol 75mg XL daily the day of discharge.
He required norepinephrine drip, but this was discontinued in the MICU when his BP improved with MAPs in the 70s.
He was normotensive on transfer to the floor and his Metoprolol was held with his SBP in the ~90s.
Pt was initially on IV Protonix, then was switched to PO PPI.
He was treated with Zofran, calcium carbonate, Aluminum-Magnesium Hydrox, and simethicone.
He was treated with quetiapine, and his mental status improved while he weaned off sedation when he was intubated and then improved further after extubation.
This may have been dilutional, but the patient was transfused with 1 unit PRBCs on [**8-2**].
Due to his history of being HIT antibody +, he was not treated with unfractionated heparin.
He was treated with aspirin 81 mg PO/NG DAILY and Fondaparinux Sodium 2.5 mg SC DAILY.
# BPH: On Flomax at home.
# History of stroke and seizures: The patient remained clinically stable on his home Lacosamide 50 mg PO/NG DAILY, Pravastatin 20 mg PO HS, and Aspirin 81 mg PO/NG DAILY.
Home medications were initially held, but were restarted on discharge.
His home Duloxetine 60 mg PO DAILY was held initially but restarted on [**8-5**] .
# Skin conditions: Pt on several home medications that were continued, including Hydrocortisone Cream 0.5% 1 Appl TP TID:PRN intching, Ketoconazole 2% 1 Appl TP DAILY, and Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.1% Cream 1 Appl TP [**Hospital1 **] to scalp as needed.
Transitional issues: # The patient responds well to diuresis with IV furosemide 20mg if there are signs of fluid overload.
# The patient's metoprolol 25mg tid was consolidated to metoprolol succinate 75 once a day, but his SBP has been in the high 90s towards the end of his hospital stay, so antihypertensives had been held.
# Patulous esophagus seen on CTA Chest [**7-25**]: outpatient esophagram can be obtained if indicated # The patient will need rehab for his left hip surgery.

You were admitted because you had a broken hip which required surgery.
Your recovery was complicated by pneumonia, pulmonary edema (fluid in your lungs), and respiratory failure, which required that we insert a breathing tube and provide mechanical ventilations in the medical ICU.
We also treated you with oxygen, antibiotics for the pneumonia and diuretic medications, which remove fluid from your body.
We also gave you medications to maintain your blood pressure.
You responded to treatment well, except for some confusion known at ICU delirium.
Once you improved, we transferred you to the general medicine floor and monitored you for several more days until your oxygen was stopped completely.
You should CHANGE Metoprolol to Metoprolol 75mg XL once a day for high blood pressure.
You should START the skin ointments and powders for your rashes, as needed, for 1-2 weeks until they resolve.
You may START acetaminophen and morphine for pain control, as needed.
You may continue the rest of your medications as previously prescribed.
