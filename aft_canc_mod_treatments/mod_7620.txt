Admission Date:  [**2137-5-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-6-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-9-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Neurontin  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 495**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracentesis  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year old female with a PMH significant for metastatic colon cancer on palliative cetuximab therapy admitted to the MICU for dyspnea and hypoxia.
The patient presented to oncology clinic this morning for scheduled cetuximab therapy and was noted to have a SaO2 87%RA increased to mid-90s on 3L nc.
The patient was placed on BiPap with subjective improvement and subsequently converted to NSR.
Attempts to discontinue BiPap resulted in marked increase in dyspnea and O2 sat 90%.
Cardiology was called in the ED and based on ECG and cardiac biomarkers, elevated TnT was felt to be secondary to demand ischemia but recommended heparin gtt.
The patient received ASA 325 mg, vancomycin, heparin gtt, and pip/tazo and was transferred to the MICU for further management.
Oncologic history: Metastatic colon cancer, status post five cycles of FOLFOX and Avastin on protocol, which was completed in [**2135-4-10**].
Chemotherapy was resumed in [**2135-9-10**] in the setting of rising CEA and CT evidence of disease progression.
She completed 13 cycles of oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and Avastin as of [**2136-6-29**].
She had a rise in her CEA and therefore her regimen was switched to FOLFIRI and Avastin on [**2136-7-20**].
Chemotherapy was discontinued as of [**2136-10-17**].
KRAS testing of her original tumor specimen was wild type.
Dsypnea less likely to be related to cetuximab therapy given dyspnea and hypoxia prior to chemo infusion.
The patient was placed on BiPaP in the ED and had a persistent BiPaP requirement during her admission for comfort.
She had a diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis with exudative pleural fluid based on Light's criteria with cytology pending at the time of death.
Serial CXR after therapeutic paracentesis was performed were notable for reaccumulation of pleural effusion, and attempts at weaning BiPaP were unsuccessful.
After numerous family meetings in discussion with the patient's primary oncologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the patient and her family, the patient was made comfort measures only.
BiPaP was titrated for comfort and the patient expired shortly thereafter.
During her hospital course, she intermitently had runs of narrow complex tachycardia with a ventricular rate up to 220 that was minimally responsive to AV nodal blockade with IV metoprolol and diltiazem.
She was initially heparinized per discussion with cardiology, and this was held as the patient was transitioned to comfort measures only.
# Colon CA: Patient with extensive mets on palliative biologic therapy with cetuximab.
# Goals of care: As above, multiple family meetings were held during her admission in consultation with the patient's primary oncologist, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] palliative care and the patient was transitioned to comfort measures only.
