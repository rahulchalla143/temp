The patient was doing well on a T-piece trial on 35% face mask after her original intubation.
However, after receiving blood and fluids, the patient had respiratory distress.
She was given further mechanical ventilatory support and was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further management of airway problems.
Perioperative myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident at [**Hospital6 1129**], thought related to high hematocrit and leukocytes earlier this year at the time of her second hip arthroplasty.
ALLERGIES:  The patient had allergies to codeine, Demerol and possibly contrast, but she received a CT scan without difficulty at the other hospital.
RADIOLOGY DATA:  A portable chest x-ray dated [**2176-8-21**] showed the nasogastric tube to be in good position with a left sided PICC line at the superior vena cava.
A chest CT scan dated [**2176-8-14**] showed bilateral effusions with atelectasis, peripheral right upper lobe and lingular pulmonary embolisms, neck hematoma which was not compressive and mediastinal drains in place and interval enlargement of the hematoma.
CARDIAC STUDIES:  An echocardiogram of [**2176-8-8**] showed marked left atrial enlargement, moderate right atrial enlargement, septum bowed to the right atrium, no atrioseptal defect, a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 55%, normal size, right ventricular volume and pressure overload, moderate right dilation, mild aortic stenosis, trace aortic regurgitation, 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonic regurgitation, trivial effusion; from the prior study, this noted new tricuspid regurgitation and moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.
PULMONARY:  The patient was continued on assist-control ventilation and later weaned to pressure support ventilation.
Solu-Medrol was given for tracheal edema.
Since then, she was placed on face mask oxygen with humidification.
On [**2176-8-18**], the patient desaturated to 88%, but recovered with supplemental oxygen.
Vigorous chest physical therapy and incentive spirometry were provided.
Antibiotics were discontinued on [**2176-9-4**].
She had a slight desaturation to the low 90s on [**2176-9-6**], but was mouth breathing at the time and not taking her nasal cannula oxygen.
A chest x-ray showed mild pulmonary edema, thought to be related to fluids given at the time of her PEG placement and she was given 20 mg of Lasix.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  For her coronary artery disease, beta blockade was titrated up slowly and her cholesterol was checked.
Aspirin was held for a question of platelet dysfunction with the polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
Hypertension became an issue after earlier stable blood pressures, at some points even needing intravenous fluids for low blood pressures.
As her blood pressure rose, eventually Norvasc, Captopril and Lopressor were titrated up to provide control.
The cardiology service was reconsulted on [**2176-8-19**] and they felt that the problem was either atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia or atrial fibrillation and amiodarone was initiated at loading doses with caution, given her history of contrast allergy and thyroid issues.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was treated with levofloxacin and Flagyl for 14 days for community-acquired pneumonia starting on [**2176-8-8**].
This was changed to vancomycin on [**2176-8-16**] for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive sputum and positive blood cultures with gram positive cocci, originally to complete a ten day course.
A subclavian central line was pulled for positive cultures on [**2176-8-17**] after a triple lumen catheter was placed to replace it.
The infectious disease service's recommendations included tapering the steroids, checking the Clostridium difficile, giving vancomycin for at least ten to 14 days given the areas that she might seed with bacteria, including her neck and hip hardware, and checking fungal cultures for any spikes.
On [**2176-8-25**], the patient had levofloxacin and Flagyl reinitiated for a new infiltrate on chest x-ray, which was originally only done for nasogastric tube placement.
Vancomycin was stopped on [**2176-8-26**] and the patient was afebrile thereafter.
No changes were made to her antibiotics after this time with her antibiotic course of levofloxacin and Flagyl completed on [**2176-9-3**].
After a positive urinalysis, the Foley catheter was discontinued on [**2176-8-29**].
HEME:  The patient was initially treated with hydroxyurea and anagrelide for her polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
She was also transfused with three units of packed red blood cells early in her course to obtain a goal hematocrit of 30.
Anagrelide was changed to b.i.d.
A hypercoagulability panel was sent for her pulmonary embolus history and heparin was started on [**2176-8-16**].
Coumadin was begun on [**2176-8-22**] for her pulmonary embolus.
The patient then required another unit of packed red blood cells and the hematology service was reconsulted and felt that she might be in the spent phase of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] with myelofibrosis.
However, hemolysis laboratory studies were sent on [**2176-8-26**] in an effort to explain her low increase in hematocrit after transfusion and stool was guaiac tested repeatedly.
He felt that there was no need to act regarding hemolysis and said that the schistocytes on peripheral smear probably represented the effects of her myelofibrosis.
On [**2176-8-29**], we considered getting a right upper quadrant ultrasound to explain asymmetric edema of the right upper extremity, but this was thought to be due mediastinal hematoma per the medical intensive care unit team and was improving and, further, would not have changed her management because she was already anticoagulated.
The patient's Coumadin was increased to 7.5 and then decreased to 5 after a good INR was obtained.
Heparin was discontinued.
On [**2176-9-2**], a decision was made to hold the polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] medications despite her increasing platelet count to 500,000 or greater because of her low hematocrit.
Coumadin was discontinued for PEG placement and she was given vitamin K to decrease her INR.
She was covered with heparin in the meantime.
After PEG tube placement, heparin was restarted with Coumadin.
She will need to be covered with Lovenox until her Coumadin is therapeutic.
FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  Tube feeds were started and titrated up.
Intravenous fluids were stopped on [**2176-8-10**] because the patient had a large positive balance.
A subclavian central line was placed on [**2176-8-7**] and discontinued, as per the infectious disease section above, after she had positive blood cultures.
A PICC line was placed on [**2176-8-21**].
Tube feeds were restarted after her PEG tube was placed and, at the time of discharge, are being tolerated well by the patient.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  After the endotracheal tube was removed, the patient had a swallowing study on [**2176-8-21**], which she failed.
Therefore, her nasogastric tube was kept to give medications and nutrition.
The patient was given Reglan as well to prove gastric motility.
Plans were therefore to keep her nasogastric tube and to retry later.
Diarrhea developed and Clostridium difficile was checked repeatedly and remained negative.
The diarrhea resolved after her Colace was discontinued.
However, it might also have been because Flagyl was coincidentally started for pneumonia at the same time.
Promote with Fiber tube feeds were felt to be ideal for her because it contained fiber but not lactose.
Baseline liver function tests were checked, given her amiodarone loading.
The PEG tube was completed on [**2176-9-4**] by the interventional radiology service without complications.
ENDOCRINE:  Thyroid medications were given.
On [**2176-8-26**], the patient had decreased but acceptable urine output and a stable creatinine which had stayed stable since the Foley catheter was discontinued.
The patient was incontinent, so at discharge the plan was to restart Ditropan and see if she could regain control.
Chest physical therapy was added to help with secretion management.
Occupational therapy was added on [**2176-9-4**].
However, they could not do a myelogram and the procedure was terminated early because of patient discomfort and her right side was not checked.
At the time of discharge, the patient had improving function of her right sided weakness.
PROPHYLAXIS:  Prophylaxis was with Prevacid and pneumoboots and then heparin after her PEG was secured.
Coumadin was added for pulmonary embolus.
Prevacid was later changed to Protonix, as this was less deliriogenic; however, it was changed back to Prevacid because Protonix could not be crushed.
