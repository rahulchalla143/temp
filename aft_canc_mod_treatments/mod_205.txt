He was treated with XRT and surgery and did quite well subsequently.
A right ureteronephrectomy was planned with suspicion for a transitional cell carcinoma.
The procedure was aborted after multiple liver biopsies.
The patient was extubated post surgery but subsequently developed respiratory distress and wheezing.
He was able to come off ventilator and was sent to ALCOVE.
He was placed on Digoxin 0.125 mg and started on Coumadin as well as put on Lasix 40 mg twice a day, in order to prevent further episodes of pulmonary edema.
Respiratory:  The patient was brought to the floor on five liters of oxygen saturating at about 90%.
He was stable on that until the night when he decompensated and we needed to put him on non rebreathing mask, when he desaturated to the mid 80's on nasal prongs.
They also gave him 20 mg of Lasix intravenous.
He was able to be weaned off of treatment by the last 24 hours of hospitalization and was saturating between 89 and 92% on room air, ambulating freely.
This was thought to be secondary to trauma on intubation which bled slightly on the starting of heparin for anticoagulation.
He tolerated the procedure well.
He was given Mucomyst and hydration prior to CT of the head with contrast to lessen the chances of any nephrotoxicity.
He tolerated the procedure without complications.
He will be followed up by his primary care physician and by his oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the near future for possible treatment and evaluation of his cancer and other health problems.
