On [**8-30**], pt developed respiratory distress and hypoxemia, was intubated and treated for ARDS.
Pt improved and vent was weaned but pt's mental status did not improve with removal of sedation.
Considered etiologies remained hepatic encephalopathy with ongoing treatment with Lactulose and Rifaximin and good stooling response, as well as slowed clearance of sedating medications used while intubated given obesity.
Pt continued to have daily spontaneous breathing trials which she passed easily but given mental status was maintained on minimal ventilator support and was trached on [**9-17**] with Shiley trach.
Pt repeatedly sedated with propofol and ativan drip given agitation and fighting of vent.

[**2145-9-21**] Abdomen U/S  IMPRESSION:  1) Cholecystostomy tube not visualized.
2) Soft tissue thickening anterior to the anterior surface of the liver which could represent omental metastases in light of history of colon carcinoma as suggested by OMR note, although the PET scan was reported as negative.
Percutaneous cholecystostomy tube adjacent to a collapsed gallbladder.
As the tube was not visualized on ultrasound this is concerning for tube malpositioning.
Further evaluation with tube cholangiogram under fluoroscopy is recommended.
Otherwise, no significant change since prior studies.
Pt arrived to MICU from OSH with altered mental status likely from a combination of medication overload in the setting of liver dysfunction and hepatic encephalopathy.
Lactulose and rifaximin where continued, sedation was decreased and mental status began to improve with some clearing and purposeful movements but unable to follow commands.
Was also started on acyclovir given rash on face and +Ab to HSV2 in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] continue for 7d (last dose 10/28).
Also started on thiamine given questionable nutrition status in setting of lap band.
Cirrhosis with etiology likely combination of chemotherapy induced and fatty liver, also with component of active liver inflammation and rising bilirubin.
Had a perc chole drain placed at OSH, which was pulled in house after a CT scan showed that it may have been out of place.
Followed by the liver sevice and not a transplant canditated given h/o metastatic colon cancer history w/ < 5 yrs from colectomy and diagnosis.
Pt arrived with trach in place with minimal ventilator support and was eventually able to breath with only a trach mask.
Wound care following and some improvement reported.
Pt was maintained on insulin sliding scale and lantus for diabetes.

It is thought that since your liver is not working well, toxins are building up in your body and affecting your brain and your ability to think clearly.
Also you received a lot of medications when you had to be intubated that took a long time to clear out of your body because your liver is not working.
You were evaluated by the liver doctors and it was determined that you are currently not a candidate for a liver transplant because you had cancer within the past five years.
Please return to the hospital if you experience any fevers, chills, night sweats, worsening of your mental status,  Followup Instructions: Please follow up with Heptology on [**2145-10-22**] at 3:20pm, with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**], at the Liver Center, at [**Hospital **] Medical Building, [**Location (un) **].
