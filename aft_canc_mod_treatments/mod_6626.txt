On [**2169-4-5**], the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, full mobilization of the stomach and porta hepatis with D1 lymphadenectomy, total gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy and placement of J-tube, which went well without complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO/NGT, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and epidural catheter for pain control.
Neuro: The patient received Fentanyl/Bupivacaine via epidural catheter immediately post op.
The patient continued to have severe post operative pain and epidural was removed on POD # 2, patient was started on Dilaudid PCA with IV Toradol with good effect and adequate pain control.
PCA was discontinued on POD # 5, the patient's pain was controlled with IV Dilaudid prn.
When tolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to liquid Roxicet which given via patient's J-tube.
The patient's tachycardia continued to persist throughout hospitalization and he was started on IV Metoprolol with good effect.
GI: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV fluids.
The patient's diet was advanced to regular post gastrectomy diet.
The patient oral intake was inadequate and tube feed was continued throughout the hospitalization.
The patient was on TPN from [**4-22**] to [**4-26**].

The patient was started on IV Ancef, erythema started to improve and subsided on POD # 9.
The patient received Ancef/Kefzol for 7 days total.
CT demonstrated  Perisplenic and left flank fluid collections concerning for hemorrhage, likely due to splenic laceration, the perisplenic and left flank fluid collections were rim-enhancing suggestive of infection.
On [**4-16**], patient underwent IR drainage with drain placement into left flank collection.
On [**4-17**], patient's HCT dropped from 30 to 26 and patient's tachycardia increased to 150 s. The patient underwent abdominal CTA on [**4-18**], which demonstrated anterior aspect splenic artery pseudoaneurysm and increased parasplenic hematoma.
The patient's pseudoaneurysm was coiled at the same day and his pigtail drain was changed to 12 French from 10.
The patient was transferred in ICU after procedure secondary to tachycardia.
The patient received 8 units of pRBC and 4 units of Plasma during and post procedure, his post transfusion HCT was 38.1.
On [**2169-4-20**], patient underwent upper GI check which was negative, but TF was held and patient started on TPN.
On [**4-25**] repeat Upper GI swallowing test was negative for leak and TF was restarted.
IR drain was removed on [**2169-4-27**], patient started to have bloody bowel movements, his abdominal pain increased and GI was consulted.
Abdominal pain continued to increase and on [**4-30**] patient underwent IR guided left flank collection drainage with 12  French pigtail catheter insertion, fluid was sent for microbiology.
Gram stain was positive for gram negative and gram positive growth and patient was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn.
On [**2169-5-3**] patient underwent colonoscopy s/t persistent bloody BMs.
Aureus Coag positive and Enterococcus and Zosyn was changed to Cefepime.
The patient underwent fistulogram at the same day, which showed no evidence of perisplenic colonic fistula.
The final sensitivities were available on [**5-6**] and patient's antibiotic treatment was changed to Zosyn and Daptomycin.
On [**5-8**] he underwent surgical evacuation and drainage of infected perisplenic hematoma with placement of vacuum-assisted closure device, the patient tolerated operation well.
The TF was continued at goal, diet was advanced to regular post gastrectomy diet and IV fluids were discontinued.
The patient continued to do well, PICC line was placed on [**2169-5-12**].
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible with Physical Therapy.
Wound VAC was taken down prior discharge and will applied in Rehab.
