aspiration during her bone marrow biopsy [**9-6**].
She had not been responding to Lasix on the floor.
Because she was increasingly uncomfortable with the BiPAP mask, she was changed back to a NRB for awhile, and was eventually placed on nasal CPAP.
While it was hoped that her intubation was only for the bronch, she instead required mechanical ventilatory support until [**2107-9-21**].
She underwent a course of high-dose steroids (methylprednisolone 500 mg IV bid x 6 doses) for presumed DAH.
This was treated with 100% O2 and resolved on its own, not requiring chest tube placement.
She was able to be transferred back up to the floor on [**9-23**], and was slowly weaned off her oxygen.
By discharge, she was alternating between room air and 2 liters O2 per nasal cannula.
She may have had a pneumonia, as she improved on caspofungin, ceftazidime, and vancomycin.
She was originally on standing Lasix, but by time of discharge she only received Lasix (20 mg IV) after RBC transfusions.
She was given Lopressor 5 mg IV x1, Diltiazem 10 mg IV x1, and placed on a dilt gtt.
They felt she had a combination of atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation ,and recommended control with a dilt gtt as needed, and po verapamil.
She eventually no longer required the dilt, and was maintained on verapamil with good results.
ID:  Given her fxnal neutropenia, she was begun on empiric antibiotics when she originally developed diffuse opacities on CXR.
She was treated with Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, bactrim, and clinda (initially).
Her vanc was discontinued 2 days later and she was begun on ambisome for empiric antifungal coverage.
Due to the lipid content in ambisome and its possible interaction with surfactant in the lung, she was changed to caspofungin.
Her antibiotics were all eventually stopped and she remained afebrile for a while.
Twice in the week before discharge, she had low-grade temperatures but was asymptomatic.
While she was in the hospital, she required increasing frequency of transfusions.
She received packed red blood cells and platelets every other day, to keep a hematocrit greater than 25 and platelets greater than 20K (given the fear that she had bled into her lungs, it was felt that a platelet transfusion threshold of 20K was more advantageous than 10K).
On examination of her bone marrow biopsy, the attending heme pathologist felt that it was likely her cells were so dysplastic they did not survive long in the periphery.
Prior to d/c a conversation was had with the patient where it was discussed and agreed upon by everybody (including the attending Hematologist) that there was no further treatment indicated for her MDS, and she would continue with symptomatic transfusions.

It is very important to continue taking your verapamil as it keeps your heart from beating too quickly, as it did when you were in the ICU.
He will receive a copy of your d/c summary.
She does not wish to have any antibiotics, and wishes only to have transfusions as needed.
