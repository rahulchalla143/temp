Initial treatment with melphalan and prednisone, [**2142-2-28**] followed by VAD [**Month (only) **], [**2142-9-25**] with autologous stem cell transplant in 01/[**2143**].

Noted for slow progression of her disease in the fall of [**2150**] and status post a second donor lymphocyte infusion on [**2151-2-5**] given at a dose of one x10 to the seventh T-cell/kg.
Following discharge, she was started on thalidomide for a short period of time, but was readmitted on [**2151-9-28**] due to left lower edema and new DVTs.
Received Cytoxan [**2151-9-30**] with Decadron 20mg X 4 days with no change in disease.
Received Velcade 1.3mg/m2 D1 and D4, but then admitted due to worsening lower extremity edema and increased creatinine.
Also on dialysis for renal failure.
Coumadin is anticoagulation.
Retraction of the right central line is warrented as its tip lies at the IVC/atrial junction.
Right supraclavicular central venous catheter ends in the right heart, close to the tricuspid valve.
S/p left pigtail catheter palcement with decrease in hydropneumothorax.

female with h/o Multiple myeloma and Amyloidosis s/p auto and allo SCT with complicated medical history including multiple DVTs, and sponatenous pneumothoraces s/p chest tube placement now admitted for hypoxia when she was seen in clinic with an O2 saturation of 86% on RA.
On the day of admission, she had a CT guided pigtail catheter placed and approximately 700 cc was drained via chest tube.
The patient was seen by thoracic surgery, and the following morning, she underwent pleurodesis on the left side.
Approximately 2-3 hours later, the patient became acute short of breath, hypoxic to the high 80s, and required non-rebreather mask to keep her O2 sat >93%.
She was given gentle IV fluids to support her pressures without worsening her pulmonary edema and hypoxia.
Her chest tube was removed prior to transfer.
She was weaned off of the oxygen and was able to maintain her O2 sats 91-96% on RA and occasionally requiring O2.
She will also continue bactrim prophylaxis.
# ESRD (CKD V): The patient is on Hemodialysis on T/Th/Fr.
She will continue this regimen and followup with nephrology as scheduled.
She will also continue her nephrocaps.
She was started on a heparin gtt, and restarted on her coumadin post procedure.
She will continue coumadin 3 mg daily, with followup of her INR when she goes to clinic next week.
