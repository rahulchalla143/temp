She eventually required intubation for hypoxia.
She was given 4L of IVF and required levofed and Neosyn at one point.
They did not recommend any heparin or cardiac catheritization, but recommended cycling CE, EKGs and an ECHO if she remains unstable.
In the ED she was given levofloxacin 500mg IV x1 and CTX 1 gm IV x1 for presumed PNA.

Right breast, frozen section, core needle biopsy (A): Invasive ductal carcinoma.
Right breast, permanent, core needle biopsy (B-C): Invasive ductal carcinoma.
ADDENDUM: FISH assay for HER-2/neu gene amplification was performed by US LABS, [**Street Address(2) 7630**], [**Location (un) 7631**], [**Numeric Identifier 7632**]: Result:  NOT AMPLIFIED Estrogen Receptor: Interpretation:  Positive (>1% of tumor cells positive) Progesterone Receptor: Interpretation:  Positive (>1% of tumor cells positive)  CXR [**2160-3-22**]: Right middle and lower lobe consolidation with associated moderate effusion.
The ET tube terminates in the right mainstem bronchus and should be pulled back by 3 cm and a repeat radiograph should be obtained to document appropriate positioning.
The right-sided pigtail catheter tip is in the pleural space, however, part of the loop of the pigtail is outside the pleural space as described.
7mm focus of enhancement over the right frontal extra-axial convexity may represent artefactual venous enhancement.
Mesothelial cells and lymphocytes.
Brief Hospital Course: 52 y/o F with history of DM on insulin and HTN who presented with SOB and developed respiratory failure thought [**3-5**] pleural effusion and widely metastatic breast malignancy.
# Respiratory failure, hypercarbic: Pt required intubation upon arrival to ED given hypoxia and tachypnea.
PNA was also a possibility given leukocytosis at presentation.
She was treated empirically with 8 days of cefepime + vancomycin.
IP was consulted and 800cc of transudative pleural fluid were drained from the right chest, fluid cytology was negative for malignant cells, pleurex catheter was left in place.
Lasix drip was used to diurese her and she was eventually transitioned to boluses of lasix.
She used a schedule of 2 hours on and 2 hours off NIV, and over 2 days she was able to extend her times off of NIV so that she only used it at night.
Pleurex catheter was later found to be in subcutaneous space and was removed.
Pleural effusion reaccumulated in the interim, requiring another pigtail catheter that drained initially 2L daily.
Repeat chest xray showed minimal reaccumulation of pleural effusion by time of discharge and IP inserted pleurex catheter on day prior to discharge for further drainage.
She did not require bipap by time of discharge.
She was discharged on po lasix for further diruesis.
She was started on taxol on [**2160-4-3**] with good response.
She received her next doses on [**2160-4-10**] and [**2160-4-17**] and tolerated chemotherapy well.
# Blood pressure instability: Pt became hyoptensive to systolic 60s following intubation, requiring pressors in the ICU.
Midodrine was then started and were able to wean off neosynephrine.
Her blood pressures stabilized, and she was able to be taken off of the Midodrine as well.
Of note, pt does have history of HTN and was on diovan-HCTZ and diltiazem prior to admission.
Her home BP medications, therefore, were discontinued.
Aspirin 325mg was continued and she was started on simvastatin.
Described the pain as right sided, near her breast mass, and was tender on palpation of epigastrium towards the right.
She often refused therapeutic interventions (e.g.
However, she adamantly refused rehab and was discharged home with VNA services; documents were also submitted for additional services including personal care attendant, the ride, and home PT.
