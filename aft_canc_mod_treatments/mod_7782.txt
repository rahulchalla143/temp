BONE MARROW Biopsy final results pending  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a very nice 54 YO gentleman with CAD s/p MI and h/o endocarditis s/p bioprosthetic AVR with recent history of GIB requiring 6 RBC units comes to the emergency room with fatigue and progressive failure to thrive at home [**1-26**] diffuse bone lesions (malignancy of unknown primary), pneumonia, GI bleed, hyponatremia.
MRI was done of spine which showed diffuse lesions appearing to be malignant, along with pathologic fracture at T12.
Oncology service was contact[**Name (NI) **] given lytic lesions appeared suspicious for malignancy, bone marrow biopsy was done.
Bone scan was done for further evaluation, and showed diffuse bone lesions through out the body.
Considering pt's father died of a "bone cancer" or unkown primary with bone mets, family wanted to pursue further workup.
UPEP/SPEP negative, ANCA and [**Doctor First Name **] negative.
Also on the differential for bone pain andlesions, along with weight loss, was endocarditis which was ruled out by TEE.
Because of extent of disease and patient discomfort, decision was made by family to extubate patient (intubated for PNA, discussed below) and focus on comfort measures.
Pt was discharged to home with hospice with PO morphine solution, scopolamine and fentanyl patches, hyoscyamine sublingual.
Treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.
Bronchoscopy was done x 3 for diagnosis and the final time for potential symptomatic relief prior to extubation for comfort, above.
Antibiotics were discontinued when decision was made to focus on comfort and pt was extubated.
He was transfused 5 units PRBC over the course of admission with stabilization of Hct at 30-31.
He was put on IV PPI and octreotide gtt.
IV PPI was continued until comfort measures initiated.

Home oxygen Please supply with home oxygen by nasal cannula for comfort   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 **]Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Pneumonia Upper gastrointestinal bleed Anemia Hyponatremia Bone lesions   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: You were seen in the hospital for pneumonia, for which you were treated with IV antibiotics.
You were also intubated and your breathing was helped by a breathing machine, but this tube was removed and you were able to breathe on your own.
In addition you were found to have low blood counts for which you received blood transfusions that was likely due to a bleed in your gastrointestinal tract.
This is likely due to a disease in your bones which appears to be a type of cancer (carcinoma) but an exact diagnosis was not reached after getting a bone biopsy.
After discussions with your family, it was decided to focus on comfort and pain control and to go home with hospice.
Changes to your medications: - START taking morphine 30-60 mg by mouth every two hours as needed for pain - START taking hyoscyamine 0.125 mg under your tongue four times a day - START using fentanyl patch 150 mcg/hr, change every 72 hours - START using scopolamine patch - START taking tylenol 650 mg as needed for pain - START using oxygen by nasal canula for comfort  - STOP taking carvedilol, pravastatin, aspirin, lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide, gabapentin, oxycodone   Followup Instructions: please discuss any concerns that arise with your hospice nurse.
