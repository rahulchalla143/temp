Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and it was decided he would undergo experimental protocol with reduced intensity conditioning with clofarabine, ATG, TLI (to reduce the GVD effect) and allogenic SCT for the graft-vs-tumor effect.
Should receive prophylactive ivermectin the day of admission.
He has completely tapered his trazodone and is currently on Neurontin 600 mg PO BID.

It was decided he would undergo experimental protocol with reduced intensity conditioning with clofarabine, ATG, TLI (to reduce the GVD effect) and allogenic SCT for the graft-vs-tumor effect.
Day 0 of his transplant was [**2165-3-8**].
He was started on vancomycin and aztreonam.
He then received his stem cell infusion on [**2165-3-8**].
His stem cell infusion was complicated by fevers to 102.
Ultimately, trach was placed and pt was weaned first to PSV and soon after to trach mask.
His Port-o-cath was removed on [**3-25**] and cultured out CoNS, and pt completed 1 week of vancomycin after the line pull.
His HD line was also pulled [**4-7**] - NGTD; currently has a temporary line in place for HD (tunnelled line being delayed due to repeated positive catheter tip cultures).
Vancomycin was restarted.
ENT was consulted on [**4-5**] and felt that there were no evidence of sinus infection on exam despite some opacification seen on head CT. Pt was also on micafungin for positive B-glucan (127 on [**4-2**]), which was initially thought to be a false positive result (since there were several possible reasons for it such as CVVH and IVIG).
Ultimately, there was no evidence of a fungal infection, but pt remained on micafungin for prohphylaxis.
Pt was intubated, placed on ARDSnet protocol, and slowly weaned off the ventilator.
Initially pt required pressure support ventilation at night to support respiration however he was able to be weaned to 35 % trach mask.
Pt was started on anticoagulation with heparin gtt x 2 weeks which was subsequently stopped when pt developed an iliopsoas hematoma.
Pt is currently off of all anticoagulation given the bleed and limited findings to support diagnosis of PE.
# Iliopsoas hematoma: developed spontaneously in setting of systemic anticoagulation for ?PE as above.
# ARF: Thought to be multifactorial: Bacteremia, contrast dye pt received for a CT scan, supratherapeutic cyclosporine, gentamycin and acyclovir (acyclovir crystals seen in urine).
Pt was started on CVVH initially for maximum diuresis, which was then switched to HD when blood pressure tolerated.
Monitoring digoxin and cyclosporin levels closely in setting of HD.
Rate controlled with Lopressor/ Digoxin was restarted with daily digoxin levels in setting of HD.
Pt will need anticoagulation to reduce risk of stroke in the future.
He winces to pain everywhere on his body--this hyperasthesia was initially attributed to cymbalta withdrwal but persisted for over two months since cessation of cymbalta.
Psych and neuro have been following the patient, per both teams, his current mental status is attributable to a profound delirium secondary to his multiple ongoing medical problems; they recommend haldol for agitation.
BMT team followed patient in the ICU for management of CellCept and cyclosporin dosing.
Levofloxacin was started on [**4-7**] for concern about increased trach secretions.
BAL revealed gram negative rods and pt was restarted on aztreonam (given PCN allergy).
Neurology eventually recommended a third set of MRI/LP but this was not pursued as it was felt to be low yield given no change in his clinical status.
Given the lack of progress in his mental status, cyclosporin was discontinued on day+55 (but soon restarted at a lower dose) to determine if this could be contributing to his AMS.
During the last week of [**Month (only) **], Mr.[**Known lastname 102904**] mental state gradually improved as he was weaned of cyclosporin and by the first week in [**Month (only) 205**] we was alert, oriented, and conversant.
It is now believed that much of his AMS can be attributed to cyclosporine neurotoxicity.
He has at times been somewhat confused and on [**5-22**], was confused and hypersomnolent without a known cause.
Renal was consulted again, and ARF was believed to be due to prerenal azotemia progressing to ATN, likely caused by elevated uric acid levels and use of acyclovir in setting of volume depletion from copious diarrhea.
Dose of acyclovir was adjusted and allopurinol started on [**5-24**].
# AFIB/RVR: Mgt with metoprolol and digoxin continued.
Given decreased relative sensitivity of flex sig, colonoscopy was pursued which was negative, but endoscopy showed two large oozing necrotic duodenal ulcers.
Pantoprozole IV was started which brought relief to Pt's pain after two days, and as of [**5-24**] abdominal exam much improved and patient is no longer complaining of abdominal pain.
Ciprofloxacin was d/c and rash still present but resolving as of Jult 10. .
#Hearing Loss Pt noted to have increased hearing loss bilaterally since admission to the hospital, etiology unclear but believed may be in part secondary to gentamicin toxicity.
Pt reports his hearing improved significantly after this treatment, but still w/ hearing deficits.
Plastic surgery was consulted for wound debridement on [**5-22**] and is following the patient.
Plastic is following Pt but wound site is very tender and creates significant discomfort for pt... [**Date range (3) 102905**] # Afib: Currently in afib with RVR.
Increased diltiazem 60 mg qid to 90 mg QID with little effect.
Off anticoagulation given history iliopsoas hematoma.
- Continue AV nodal blockade with diltiazem 90 mg QID.
- Start metoprolol 25 mg PO q8hr.
Will cover with metoprolol IV and increase metoprolol dose if needed.
In addition, can also be a side effect of mycophenolate mofetil.
?negative to date - CMV: negative - Continue solumedrol 60 mg IV BID - F/u with BMT - f/u GI recs.
# Pulmonary infiltrates: Stable pulmonary exam currently without supplemental oxygen requirement.
- Continue [**Last Name (un) 2830**], vanco, levofloxacin as above.
Per ID, will hold flagyl given meropenem.
- Check galactomannan and beta-glucan.
- Gentle IVF repletion with NaHCO3 given low bicarb in setting of diarrhea.
- Continue allopurinol and acyclovir - Follow-up renal recs -[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course [**Date range (1) 12474**] # GI Bleed: Pt arrived in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] early AM after having profuse bright red blood per rectum with hemdynamic instability on BMT floor.
Pt was given emergent fluid resucitation and pRBC transfusions (as of [**6-9**], had 6 units of pRBCs and 3 units of platelets).
He had required intermittent pressor support to maintain pressures.
Surgery did not feel that the patient would be a good surgical candidate given his co-morbidities.
Both surgery and GI recommend possible IR embolization, which the patient never needed as he last required blood products on evening [**6-8**].
Upon transfer to BMT, the pt is currently NPO except meds, and on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].
Since the patient had a GI bleed, all of his PO nodal agents were D/C??????ed.
IV Lopressor and diltiazem were given to control the rate before switching back to a PO regimen of metoprolol 75 TID (transferred on 100 mg TID) and dilt 90 mg QID.
# Refractory multiple myeloma admitted on [**2165-2-25**] now s/p mini-allogeneic SCT: His course has been extremely complicated and now with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
Following daily tacro levels and LFTs.
We have continued his Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg IV BID and ID prophylaxis with  Acyclovir, Bactrim, voriconazole .
# HTN: Started on metoprolol PO and home dilt per above.
# ID: --Worsening opacities on CT from [**6-3**]: ID initially suggested doing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1066**] for treatment, however this was deferred since galactomannan and beta glucan markers for aspergillus negative.
Vori was also changed to prophylactic dose.
Respiratory Failure--resolved: Initially, pt was intubated emergently for airway protection for emergent EGD especially in setting of recent tracheostomy cap.
Pt given aggressive ressusitation with crystalloid and colloid.
Pt has initially required intermittent pressor support with neo and levo.
# DM 2: Continue ISS .
He is currently on TPN through his midline.
We suggest a PICC for TPN in the future if this is ok with BMT team.
He had another bleed on [**8-1**] that responded to pressors and massive transfusion protocol.
He received massive transfusion protocol blood products for these bleeds.
His dosage of steroids was reduced to aid in ulcer healing, and he was briefly empirically treated with ganciclovir to cover for possible CMV duodenitis as a cause of the ulcer.
After the three massive GI bleeds and massive transfusions, patient's familiy decided to not escalate his care, electing not to give any further blood products, pressors, or any further interventions should patient develop another bleed.
# Sepsis: Pt with continued enterococcus bacteremia resistant to vancomycin as well as pseudomonas bactermia and pneumonia.
He received linezolid and gentamicin for the VRE and cipro with meropenem for pseudomonas coverage.
# Respiratory failure: Pt was intubated for respiratory failure due to pneumonia and later complicated by pulmonary edema.
He had difficulty weaning off of the ventilator given his large positive fluid balance and respiratory weakness.
His albumin was low, 1.6, likely the reason that he was unable to retain fluids intravascularly.
He received large numbers of blood products and intravenous fluids for the acute bleed resuscitation and hypotension.
Patient was placed on lasix drip to help diurese patient's overwhelming fluid load, however in the end patient was still +60L fluid balance.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Pt remains tachycardic with atrial fibrillation despite numerous interventions including amniodarone drip, esmolol drip, diltiazem drip and digoxin.
# Hyperglycemia: He has a history of diabetes and was treated with an insulin sliding scale and insulin in his TPN feeds.
Differential diagnosis includes hemolysis, acalculous cholecystits, medication effect, progression of GVHD to liver.
Multiple myeloma: His course has been extremely complicated and now with increasing immunosuppression for GVHD.
His immunosuppressants were continued with decreasing steroid dosing to aid ulcer healing and prophylaxis with atovaquone, acyclovir & voriconazole.
As patient became unable to take PO medications because of the massive GI bleeds, atovaquone was switched to inhaled pentamidine, voriconazle was discontined, and acyclovir switched to IV dosing.
