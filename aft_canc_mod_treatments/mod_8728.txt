There was a peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve of 70mm Hg which improved s/p valvuloplasty to 36mm hg.
Our pigtail catheter was inserted into the LV and pressures measured as above, confirming critical aortic stenosis.
Heparin was used prophylactically for the procedure.
A stiff amplatz wire was then exchanged over our pigtail catheter.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the lab free of angina and in stable condition.
However by admission, chest pain had resolved with SL nitroglycerin x 2.
Lasix and lisinopril were held.
She was transfered to the ICU where she was briefly on a nitro drip and received lasix.
In the setting of chronic low BP which had been labile in the past, she was kept in the ICU on a gentle lasix drip.
She was subsequently switched to lasix 60mg daily.
Lisinopril and Metoprolol were discontinued to raise her blood pressure.
Digoxin was also started with a load with a target level of 0.8, but then discontinued as her dig levels persistantly high at 1.8-1.9.
Given her recent admission with CHF and her tenous fluid status, she was evaluated for AVR and valvuloplasty.
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] determined that valvuloplasty would be her best option to control her CHF.
She underwent cardiac catheterization and valvuloplasty successfully without complication and with decrease in peak gradient from 70 mmHg to 36mm Hg.
She was discharged on Lasix 60mg daily.
She was also followed by wound care for her right leg ulcer.
