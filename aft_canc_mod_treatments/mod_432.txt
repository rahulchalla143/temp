SBP dropped into the 50's so the patient had a femoral CVL placed under emergent conditions and he was intubated after being started on norepinephrine.
The patient received bicarb, calcium, and kayexalate through an orogastric tube.
He received pip-tazo and vancomycin for empiric antibiotic coverage.

A nasogastric tube terminates in the distal esophagus/GE junction and should be advanced so that it is well into the stomach.
Right upper-to-mid lung airspace opacity is seen, worrisome for pneumonia.
He was made comfortable on a morphine drip and expired on [**2171-10-15**] at 7:40PM in the presence of multiple family members.
Upon presentation, patient was aggressively rehydrated according to the Rivers protocol with boluses of crystalloid and levophed gtt to target MAP > 65, UOP > 50cc/hr and CVP of [**9-24**].
Additionally started on broad spectrum empiric antibiotics including vancomycin/ cefepime/ ciprofloxacin and flagyl which were subsequently narrowed to ciprofloxacin given pan-sensitive enterococcus from urine culture and pansensitive proteus from blood.
Initially, the patient improved with decrease in lactate from 10.4 to 2.0, decreasing pressor requirement and defervescence.
Antibiotics were broadened to vancomycin and cefepime.
Repeat blood and urine cultures were sent, CVL was changed and antibiotics were broadened to meropenem and ciprofloxacin for improved pseudomonas coverage.
He initially required little ventilatory response but with aggressive fluid resuscitation/ persistent septic shock he developped bilateral infiltrates from VAP with fluid overload vs ARDS.
As stated above, his antibiotic coverage was expanded based on sputum culture results to vanc/ cefepime.
Mechanical ventilation c/b development of a small right apical pneumothorax that was incidentally discovered on rountine CXR.
Underwent placement of chest tube by thoracic surgery with resultant resolution of PTX.
By the end of 14 days, patient still remained dependent on mechanical ventilation.
Given the risks of significant tracheal stenosis, the patient's family was offerred tracheostomy but refused.
Of note, he did develop postoliguric diuresis with persistent electrolyte imbalances requiring aggressive repleteion  4) Hypernatremia: Present with Na of 162 in setting of severe dehydration/ poor PO intake from acute illness and underlying dementia.
Initially fluid resusicated with boluses of NS to correct underlying hypovolemia.
Started on amiodarone via IV loading protocol for rate control given relative contraindication to AV nodal agents with hypotension  6) Troponin elevation: Likely simply demand in the context of hypotension and metabolic abnormalities.
7) Hypothyroidism: Continued on home levothyroxine  8) Ulcer: Large decub without signs of secondary infection.
Wound care recommended surgical debridement but this was deferred until  9) Dementia: hold donezepil and memantine for now   Medications on Admission: -DONEPEZIL 10 mg by mouth once a day with food -LEVOTHYROXINE 88 mcg by mouth once a day -MEMANTINE 10 mg by mouth twice a day -FERROUS SULFATE 325 mg by mouth once a day -MULTIVITAMIN,TX-MINERALS 1 Capsule(s) by mouth daily   Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: expired  Discharge Condition: expired  Discharge Instructions: expired  Followup Instructions: expired
