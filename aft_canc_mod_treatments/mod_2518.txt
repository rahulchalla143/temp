Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 52 year old man with metastatic prostate cancer, who had been recently admitted with hematuria; also with history of DVT and PE now off Lovenox since recent admission, presented again with hematuria and bladder discomfort.
OF NOTE, he was previously on enoxaparin for PE/DVT but this was held throughout the hospital stay because it was thought to worsen patient's hematuria.
In conjunction with the patient's outpatient oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the decision was made *not* to restart lovenox because it was thought that risks outweigh benefits at this point, so he should not continue any anticoagulation.
He was taken by urology for a formalin procedure on [**2170-10-19**] and his Hct remained stable at first post-procedure.
Anemia likely secondary to blood loss anemia (hematuria and blood in stool) and AOCD given iron study results.
Indirect bilirubin not elevated and haptoglobin not elevated, so patient is unlikely to be hemolyzing.
Patient received 6 bags of platelets and 5 units of pRBC on this admssion and subsequently required transfusion for Hct<25 and Plts<50.
He did not bump appropriately to platelet transfusions which supported the fact that his platelets were not functioning appropriately.
Lactulose was started although subsequently stopped after prolonged period of constipation and high residuals.
Was given Nystatin S and S. Resolved.
While, in the ICU, he required platelet transfusions at first and daily blood transfusion.
Patient's temperature was 99.3 but he was on steroids for bony mets and pain control.
Patient thought to possibly be septic and coverage broadened from ceftriaxone to vanc and zosyn.
Urology had been following and took him to the OR for a procedure to inject formalin into his bladder.
Initally treated with vancomycin and Zosyn and stress dose steroids.
Arterial line placed for close BP monitoring.
#MICU Stay [**Date range (1) 36630**]/08 : Admitted to the MICU s/p R nephrostomy tube placement by IR.
Developed hypotension and tachycardia, treated with IV fluids, PRBCs, and started on pressors.
Hct was stable and bumped appropriately with PRBC transfusions.
He was subsequently placed on ceftriaxone and daptomycin.
The pressors were weaned with relative success.
After numerous conversations with the family, the family changed his status to DNR/DNI with the intention of no escalation of care.
