The patient was oxygenating well on 2L nasal canula while in the ICU.
Upon transfer to the floor, the patient continued to improve with decreasing oxygen requirements.
His sputum culture did not grow any organisms, and so his vancomycin was discontinued after completing a seven day course.

His lasix was held over the last two days of hospitalization secondary to contraction alkalosis.
He was administered SL nitrates and Lasix, and moved to an upright position.
