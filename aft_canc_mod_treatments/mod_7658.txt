She began over-the-counter agents but did not get relief and was eventually referred to a surgeon who felt this was an anal fissure in combination with hemorrhoids for which she recommended steroids and over-the-counter remedies.
On [**2160-3-10**] she underwent surgery with a rectal mass noted.
She was referred here to discuss treatment options and high-dose IL-2 was recommended.
She passed eligibility testing and is now admitted to begin cycle 1 week 1 high-dose IL-2 therapy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and underwent central line placement to begin therapy.
She developed recurrent hypotension, this time requiring the initiation of vasopressor therapy with Neo- Synephrine.
Continuous blood pressure bedside and central telemetry monitoring were instituted.
IL-2 therapy was held while on Neo-Synephrine.
IL-2 therapy was held throughout that day given mental status changes.
She initially responded to nebs and Lasix but again became tachypnea with hypoxia requiring an ICU transfer.
In addition she became hypotensive at that point requiring initiation of Neo- Synephrine blood pressure support again.
