During her admission, patient underwent cardiac catheterization, with anatomy as described below.
She had an uncomplicated stent placed to SVG to D1 for 70% in stent stenosis.
After the procedure she had two episodes of chest pain that resolved with nitroglycerin.
ECG showed inferolateral ST depressions that resolved with resolution of patient's chest pain.
She was treated with Nitroglycerin SL 0.4mg SL, ASA 325mg, Metoprolol 25mg, morphine IV.
She was given Lasix IV and then started on a heparin gtt, nitroglycerin gtt for treatment of pulmonary edema.
Patient was started on CPAP for respiratory support.

Cardiac History: CABG, in [**2158**] anatomy as follows: # CAD s/p MI and CABG '[**58**](LIMA->LAD,SVG->OM1,SVG->D1,SVG->PDA) .

Discharge labs: Na 130, K 4.9 Cl 92 Bicarb 29 BUN 42 Creat 1.2 Hct 29, WBC 12.4 Plt 360   Brief Hospital Course: 83F with CAD s/p CABG with extensive native vessel diffuse s/p taxus stent to SVG-diag on [**4-20**], HTN, COPD, DM, presenting with unstable angina and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure and profound new hypoxia.
Patient was not home long enough to miss a dose of plavix so med non-compliance not a likely factor.
Chest pain was controlled on nitro drip and she had no further episodes of chets pain during admission.
It was decided not to proceed to cardiac catheterization given the recent cardiac cath showing no intervenable lesions and patient was started on ranexa for management of chronic angina.
She was continued on statin, ASA, Plavix, BB, ACEi with some medication changes for optimization of her regimen.
Pt's regimen changed to Torsemide 20 mg [**Hospital1 **] for management of fluid retention.
Pt is compliant with a low Na diet and should have a 1500c fluid restriction.
Pt had no symptoms of infection or pneumonia and was deemed to be hypovolemic after aggressive diuresis.
Her COPD was well controlled on Advair and Spiriva.
Therefore, it is thought that hypoxia and DOE is due to pulmonary hemorrhage possibly [**1-24**] Plavix and ASA usage post stent.
This was intially attributed to upper airway bleeding given that patient was on ASA, plavix and heparin and had a recent nosebleed.
However, it also may indicate a pulmonary hemmorhage as described above.
#Hypertension: Patient's home blood pressure medications were uptitrated to achieve goal systolic blood pressure of 90-110. .
She was continued on metoprolol for rate control and a full dose aspirin.
On metformin and glyburide as an outpatient which were held on admission given the possibility of interventional procedure with contrast dye load.
She was covered with insulin sliding scale then transitioned back to home regimen with poor control necessitating increase of Glyburide to [**Hospital1 **].
She should have blood sugar checks before meals with humalog sliding scale as ordered.
#COPD: Stable, she was continue on Advair, Spiriva and Albuterol  .
