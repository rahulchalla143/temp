Imaging: CXR [**2140-4-28**]:  Followup of the patient with bladder cancer after radical prostatectomy and new bronchial mass.
Current study demonstrates the intubated patient with the ET tube tip being 5 cm above the carina.
The NG tube tip is in the stomach.
Status post radical cystectomy and ileal conduit with no evidence of leak.
CT CHEST [**2140-5-6**] FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated, with the ET tube tip being approximately 4 cm above the carina.
The NG tube tip is in the stomach.
Small groups of viable cells stain positive for cytokeratin cocktail (AE1/3 and CAM 5.2) and p63.
Cells are negative for cytokeratin 7 and cytokeratin 20.
significant for bladder cancer s/p radical cystectomy on [**4-25**] at Penobscot [**Hospital **] Hospital, unable to extubate following the proceedure and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for management, found to have left upper lobe collapse, and new bronchial mass he was treated with XRT x2 weaned off of the ventilator and returned to Penobscot [**Hospital **] Hospital per patient and family request.
Trigger may have been mechanical intubation during cystectomy on [**4-25**].
He required intermittent high PEEPs and FIO2, posing barriers to extubation.
He was taken for external beam radiation therapy and left upper lobe subsequently re-expanded.
Given high peep and FIO2 requirement there was concern that he would not be able to be weaned off of the ventilator.
He was agressively diuresed with furosemide 80mg IV BID.
He was successfully weaned off of the ventillator [**5-9**] he was weaned from non-rebreather to 4LNC which was his oxygen requirement at the time of transfer.
He was discharged on furosemide 40mg PO daily which may need to be titrated after transfer.
# Ventilator associated Pneumonia: He had a low grade temperature and was started on ventilator associated pneumonia [**5-6**] with vancomycin and zosyn.
Zosyn was changed to levaquin when patient developed a drug related rash (see below).
He will need to continue vancomycin and levaquin until [**5-14**].
Zosyn discontinued as presumed cause of rash he was treated with hydrocortisone cream and the rash improved moderately.
He should continue hydrocortisone cream for 7 days.
CT A/P with urogram and negative for ileal conduit leak.
Cr improved with diuresis and avoidance of nephrotoxins, trending down to 1.7 at the time of discharge.
# BRONCHIAL TUMOR: Broncheoscopy performed for left upper lobe collapse returned tissue consistent with non-small cell lung cancer however pathology was unable to exclude metastatic disease from bladder.
Patient was seen by Radiation Oncology and underwent palliative XRT on [**5-4**] and again on [**5-11**] without plans for further XRT sessions.
# BLADDER CANCER:  Patient now s/p radical cystectomy with ureteral stents.
Urology followed him during admission, giving recommendations about post-surgical care.
Patient put out well through his ileal conduit, and pain at incision site gradually improved, although required treatment with IV Fentanyl as needed.
Patient's creatinine initially trended down during admission, but had acute worsening on admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Obstruction and ileal conduit leak were ruled out with imaging.
# WOUND DEHISCENCE:  Patient with wound dehiscence and subsequent closure on [**4-27**].
Recommended tension sutures remain in for total of 3 weeks.
# HYPERTENSION:  Anti-hypertensives were discontinued in setting of sedation and acute illness.
Amlodipine was restared when patient was weaned off ventilator.
# HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA:  Patient is not on a statin as an outpatient; treatment was deferred to outpatient providers .
He responded well to diltiazem and he was started on diltiazem 90mg QID which was changed to diltiazem 360 XR prior to transfer.
He will need to continue diltiazem as an outpatient.
