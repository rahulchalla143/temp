She had an LP which showd lymphocytic meningitis and she was treated for TB meningitis.
Two weeks later she returned with progressive symptoms, and had respiratory failure due to a paraneoplasitc syndrome, as she had a positive anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] antibody titer.
She had a workup which revealed a single enlarged subcarinal lymph node, which was removed by VATS revealing a poorly differentiated carcinoma with neuroendocrine features.
She was transferred to the MICU for chemotherapy for presumed small cell carcinoma of the lung, and got one cycle of carboplatin/taxol.
In the interval, she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for pneumonia and received a 14 day course of Zosyn, then amikacin and ceftaz.

It is hoped that this syndrome may improve on chemotherapy once underlying disease is treated, but as it's secondary to demyelination chances are that it will not.
