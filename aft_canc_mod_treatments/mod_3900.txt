Admission Date:  [**2133-8-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-9-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-12-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: OMED  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12**] Chief Complaint: Pain, change in mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Radiation Therapy to T5 and L3 lesions(10 and 14 treatments, respectively)   History of Present Illness: 62 y/o man with unusually agressive metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma presented to the ED [**8-24**] with 2 week history of increasing back pain.
In the ED, patient became tachycardic, hypertensive and his oxygen satuartions hovered in the low to mid 90% range despite oxygen therapy via nasal cannula.
The ED staff grew concerned about abdominal perforation as the above events unfolded and his abdomen grew rigid.
CT abdomen was negative for perforation, but the patient was admitted to the surgical ICU for further work-up and treatment.
Given this result, the patient was loaded with decadron and a neurosurgery consult was obtained.
Per neurosurgery, no acute surgical management was warranted.
Radiology consult was therefore obtained and the arrangements were made to transfer the patient to the Oncology Medicine service radiation therapy, pain control and further management.
Last, pt's PNA was treated as aspiration PNA with levo/flagyl.
He had left radical groin lymph node dissection by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 957**] on [**2133-5-26**], with 6 of 9 lymph nodes showing poorly differentiated SCC with focal extracapsular extension.
In advance of inguinal radiation therapy for his resected SCC, repeat PET scanning on [**2133-7-8**] compared to a [**5-1**] PET scan showed new uptake of FDG in left iliac, bilateral para-aortic lymph nodes, and T5 and L3 vertebral bodies.
(2) Additionally, he has had evaluation of high PSAs, with deep core biopsies on [**2133-7-8**] by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 892**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 55794**], with pathology showing adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland, [**Doctor Last Name **] 7 (3+4), currently undergoing lupron therapy.
Since [**Month (only) 216**], the patient has been on combinational interferon alfa and Accutane.
This is now the beginning of his 3rd week of therapy, at 1.5 million units daily of IFA and 20 mg [**Hospital1 **] of Accutane.
Intermittent SOB, currently on nasal cannula.
1) SCC: Mr [**Known lastname **] has known aggressive SCC with metastasis to retroperitoneum and spine (T5 now with retropulsion of bone and cord compression and L3 with [**Last Name (un) 2043**] involvement).
Furthermore, surgery would include risks of general anaesthesia, incisional wound healing, and potential complications from the procedures.
Also surgery would delay systemic chemotherapy which primary oncology team wanted to initiate as soon as possible since his disease has been so aggressive.
In addition to XRT, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was treated early on during admission with ciplatin (50mg/m2) on [**8-27**] and [**9-3**], which he tolerated well with exception of total body aches/pains after administration.
He recieved aggressive pre/post chemo hydration, and chemo had no effect on creatinine during admission.
He also received bolus of 5-FU on [**2139-9-10**] to help sensitize tumor to effects of radiation.
A portacath was placed on [**9-8**] and the plan is to start systemic chemotherapy when counts recover.
Steroid taper as follows: 4mg TID from [**Date range (1) 4359**]; 4mg [**Hospital1 **] from [**Date range (1) 12903**]; 2mg [**Hospital1 **] from [**Date range (1) 55796**]; 2mg each day from [**Date range (1) 55797**] and then stop the medication.
He continued to have uncontrolled pain on this regimen and his fentanyl patch was progressively increased to 250 micrograms.
Neurontin(300mg in am and noon, 600mg QHS) and motrin (as needed) were added with some additional relief.
By time of discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname 55795**] pain was well controlled on Fentanyl patch (250mcg) and neurontin.
He had been on ampicillin prior to admisstion per his surgeon following LN dissection which was continued throughout admission and on discharge.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have pulmonary edema on CXR on [**8-27**], likely secondary to aggressive IVF hydration for chemotherapy.
He responded well to PO diuresis with no further episodes.
4)ID: Blood cultures from [**8-24**] - 2/4 bottles with GNR - Salmonella species sensitive to both levofloxacin and ampicillin - both of which he was already taking for PNA.
Possibly secondary to chemotherapy vs dilutional effect from aggresive hydration.
6) Constipation: Pateint experienced constipation throughout admission and was treated successfully with aggressive bowel regimen - including colace, senna, dulcolax, lacutulose, and enema as needed.
7) Prostate Cancer - Patient had received 2 lupron injections prior to admission(8/25,[**8-20**]).
Will hold off on further injections for now and readdress as outpt.
8) HTN: Mr. [**Known lastname **] takes HCTZ and actopril at home which were initally d/c'ed on admission.
SBP's on transfer to OMED were consistently between 170-200 likely secondary to pain and fluid overload, and his outpatient HCTZ and actopril were restarted.
Lopressor was eventually added to further control BP with good results.
9) PT: Physical therapy worked with Mr. [**Known lastname **] throughout his admission on strength training of b/l lower ext, gait stability, transfers from sit ->stand, stair training.
10) PPX: Bowel regimen; prophylactic SQ heparin; PPI, Blood sugar levels well controlled but will cont regular insulin sliding scale for coverage given high dose steroids.
Resolved with NS IVFs; Potassium and phos were repleted as necessary.
He was started on celexa as his progressive disease, pain, and prognosis had impacted his mental state.
Medications on Admission: MEDS: HCTZ; Accupril; Ampicillin (for 1 year, per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**]; herbal tea Essiac; fish oil.
On the advice of nurse [**Last Name (un) 55799**] who is monitoring his IFA-Accutane therapy, he stopped taking vitamin A.
