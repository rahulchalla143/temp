Exploratory laparotomy with primary duodenorrhaphy.
OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  Following satisfactory induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the abdomen was widely prepped with Betadine and sterile drapes were placed.
This bled terribly unfortunately, probably requiring 200-300 cc blood loss before I could finally get this bleeding stopped with high-voltage cautery and mattress sutures of chromic.
A drain would subsequently be placed over this.
The jejunum 20 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz was brought up in a retrocolic manner and a side-to-side stapled gastrojejunostomy anastomosis constructed smoothly.
About 50 cm below the gastrojejunostomy I brought up a lazy loop of jejunum to the fundus of the gallbladder where a two-layer hand-sewn silk and Vicryl side- to-side cholecystojejunostomy anastomosis of 1 cm wide patency was achieved.
Note:  The tumor cells are positive for cytokeratin 7 and estrogen receptor and focally positive for gross cystic disease fluid protein.
The cells are negative for cytokeratin 20 and mammaglobin.
