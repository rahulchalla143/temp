Initial BP was 250/80 in the ED -> was given 20mg labetolol which dropped her BP to the 160's.
She was given 2mg IV ativan and the nystagmus quickly resolved, but her eyes remained fixed to the left for about a minute, after which her eyes returned to midline.
Her BP during the event was over 200, but after the ativan it dropped to 170's.
Several med changes were instituted at that time: Cellcept 500mg [**Hospital1 **] was switched to azathioprine 100mg qD, epogen decreased from 3 x per week to 2 x per week due to painful injections, Crestor restarted at 20mg qD, and Lasix started at 40mg PO qD for elevated BP.
Past Medical History: DM, last a1c 7.7 in [**2123**] ESRD (2o2 IDDM and HTN), s/p renal transplant [**2122**] on immunosuppressants, episode of allograft nephropathy documented by biopsy HTN b/l thoracotomy for spontaneous PTX, [**2110**] Hyperlipidemia   Social History: Pt was raised in the Phillipines, immigrated to the US in [**2096**].

Tortuous transplant renal artery with multiple 90-degree turns with folds giving apparent mild narrowing to the transplant renal artery.
Transplant kidney not seen on this study.
Renal Transplant US: IMPRESSION: Diastolic flow is only seen in one branch of the lower pole of the kidney.
Her mental status and neurological exam quickly returned to baseline, and her BP meds were titrated for optimal BP control.
Her ultimate regimen was amlodipine 10mg PO qD, metoprolol 100mg PO bid, and doxazosin 1mg PO bid.
She also had a renal MRI/A of her native and graft kidney to assess for RAS as a secondary cause of her worsening HTN.
She also had a h/o thoracotomy in her early 40s where pleurodesis was performed for spontaneous PTX.
A dedicated MRI was done of the lesion, which confirmed thin-walled septa and hypoattenuating nodules within the mass, which was thought to be associated with the spleen.
A f/u U/S done to verify splenic origin of the mass rather found that it seemed to be contiguous with segment II of her liver.
Transplant surgery decided to excise the tumor.
She was restarted on Cellcept 500mg PO bid and prednisone 5mg PO qD.
An renal MRI/A of her graft and native kidney demonstrated 50% RAS of her native RA, but no significant occlusion of her graft RA other than that induced by folding of the RA.
She was intermittently on lasix for lung crackles and increased LE edema.
