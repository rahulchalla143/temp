Incidentally he reports that he has had worsening back pain for the last week, describes [**8-17**] pain which is usually controlled on Percocet to [**3-17**].
He was given percocet for pain.
Past Medical History: - History of hairy cell leukemia diagnosed in [**2141**], status post splenectomy  without further treatment.
- Metastatic follicular thyroid cancer (summary below) - History of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia - Benign prostatic hypertrophy - DM type 2 on oral hypoglycemic agents - Hypercholesterolemia - Hypertension - Status post left hip replacement [**2166-6-2**] - Recent DVT and PE ([**2166-5-12**]) - Status post Electrophysiology ablation of AVNRT focus - Status post Fluoroscopic guided placement of [**Location (un) 260**] IVC filter .
He received external beam radiation for spinal metastases but suffered DVT complicated by coronary embolus while in rehab.
He eventually had a total thyroidectomy on [**2166-7-10**].
Because he had been on Amiodarone for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, he could not immediately be treated with radioactive iodine for his metastatic disease.
His Amiodarone was stopped in [**2166-5-8**] and with aggressive therapy, his iodine level eventually dropped in [**2167-4-7**].
He was treated with Thyrogen twice as his TSH could not be increased adequately due to topic production of thyroid hormone by metastatic thyroid carcinoma.
This allowed him to receive 200 mCi of radioactive iodine treatment [**2167-4-15**].
He was treated with Decadron around the time of the therapy due to known spinal metastases and concern for cord compression."
Approximately 2.7 x 2.5 cm low-attenuation lesion within the interpolar aspect of the right kidney likely representing a renal cyst, recommend further evaluation with ultrasound.
Further findings as described above.
He was initially treated for worsening lower back pain, and started a chronic pain regimen and restarted XRT to L hip and lumbar spine.
He spent over 1 week in the hospital when he was transferred to ICU for hypotension and placed on pressors & antibiotics.
Surgery immediately evaluated and took patient to OR [**9-6**] for fasciotomy which revealed a diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis.
He was unstable in the OR, so only his anterior legs were debrided.
He has undergone aggressive fluid resuscitation and remained intubated with relative pulmonary edema after his surgery.
He was intially treated with cefepime, vancomycin, and clindamycin as well as aggressive pressor support and ventilation.
Their goal was to maintain the patient's comfort as much as possible including extubating him, and placed on comfort measures.
