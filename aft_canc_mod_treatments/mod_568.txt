History of Present Illness: The patient is a 54-year-old man with a previous somewhat complicated medical history significant for placement of a mechanical mitral valve approximately 15 years ago.
The patient is on Coumadin for this valve prosthesis since then.
In addition,the patient has atrial fibrillation and occasional supraventricular tachycardia which are additional indications for his Coumadin treatment.On a recent abdominal CT scan, the incidental finding of an approximately 4.5 cm left adrenal mass was found.This prompted an endocrinological workup providing evidence of pheochromocytoma with elevated both plasma and urinary catecholamines.The patient has now been appropriately alpha blocked for approximately 2 weeks with the most recent dose of phenoxybenzamine being 30 mg b.i.d.
The patient has been admitted to the hospital a couple of days before surgery to be bridged with heparin drip considering his mitral valve prosthesis and after having stopped his Coumadin about 5 days ago.The patient is scheduled to undergo a left adrenalectomy today.Risks and benefits associated with procedure have been discussed in great detail and the consent form has been signed.
