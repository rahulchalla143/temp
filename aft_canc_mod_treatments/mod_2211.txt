Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 35906**] is a 78 year old right handed woman with a history of hypertension and dyslipidema who presented with sudden onset of right sided weakness, numbness and dysarthria.
Because the patient had been on aspirin at the time of presentation, it was decided to switch the patient to Plavix for future stroke prevention.
Because of this, she was started on lisinopril 5mg and atovastatin 40.
She tolerated these medications well.
Howeber, this was inconclusive and the Stroke team was reluctant to start anticoagulation without a definite indication given her MCA aneurysm.
Given her aneurysm, it was felt the patient would not gain further benefit from initiating aggressive anti-platelet therapy.
The natural history of unruptured aneurysms and available treatment options were discussed with the patient and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] from Neurosurgery.
