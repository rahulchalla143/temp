Note is made of borderline tachycardia throughout the recording.
CXR ([**3-24**]):   Brief Hospital Course: 69F with Stage IV NSCLC with brain mets, recently completed C1 chemotherapy (cisplatin/Taxol?
# NSCLC stage IV with brain mets complicated non-convulsive seizure activity: Recently completed C1 chemotherapy at [**Company 2860**], likely with cisplatin/paclitaxel.
Started on dexamethasone, and given lacosamide/keepra/phosphenytoin for seizure control.
The only further option for seizure control would be valium drip, which would require intubation.
Given her poor prognosis, she was made CMO and transferred to the floor where she expired.
#Septic shock with group A strep bacteriemia and urine growing ecoli in the setting of neutropenia: Source of bacteriemia possibly infiltrated IV in R antecubital fossa/ cellulitis.
Patient was started on vancomycin and cefepime upon transfer to the intensive care unit.
Access was difficult initially with the patient and a central line was attempted in both internal jugular veins and femoral veins without success.
Patient was maintained on peripheral dopamine drip to maintain MAP >65 and had a central line placed by interventional radiology the following morning.
Dopamine was weaned off [**3-27**] at 1500 with lactate trending down to the 1.2-1.3 range.
Antibiotics were stopped on [**3-29**] when patient was made CMO.
Of note, given the presence of brain mets and her concurrent use of anti-coagulation, it is important to maintain SBP < 140 and DBP < 110 to reduce the risk of ICH.
During her admission she was treated with fondiparinux as dalteparin was not on formulary.
