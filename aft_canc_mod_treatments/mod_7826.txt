She was recently discharged on [**2132-10-22**] after admission for expedited pre-transplant workup.
Her course was complicated by GI bleed, though EGD and ileostomy in the ICU were remarkable for absence of varices and a non-bleeding ulcer at the GE junction with old blood in the stomach.
She was treated with vanc/ceftriaxone initially and sent out on cipro.
Paracentesis could not be performed due to the absence of fluid.

She remains off lasix and aldactone since before last admission (due to hyponatremia).
She denies fevers, chills, URI symptoms, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, hematemesis, coffee ground emesis, hematochezia, melena, increased ostomy output, urinary frequency/urgency, or rash.
