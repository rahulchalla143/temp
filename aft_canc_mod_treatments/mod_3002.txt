Recently prior to her Whipple procedure, she underwent a esophagogastroduodenoscopy with stent change by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and this had shown a mass pushing on the duodenum consistent with a pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Interesting in her preoperative workup, she had undergone an pancreatic head mass, although this was nondefinitive.
After informed consent has been obtained, the patient was consented to a Whipple procedure, wedge liver biopsy, lymph node biopsy, and cholecystectomy.
She underwent a Whipple procedure with a wedge liver biopsy, lymph node biopsy, and cholecystectomy.
There was a pancreatic stent left as well as a T tube placed, as well as having [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain placed near the biliary anastomosis.
She recovered well from the operation, and she was extubated in the operating room, and was sent to the floor, where she did well over the next several days postoperatively.
Her bowel function was watched and she was given serial examinations.
Drainage output from her J-P drain was followed serially to make sure that there was no evidence of a pancreatic leak or fistula.
Ultimately on postoperative day #3, the amylase and total bilirubin was sent from this drain which revealed an amylase of 12 and total bilirubin of 0.7.
She was continued on TPN support as we awaited for return of bowel function.
The drains were seen posterior to the stomach and the drainage tube to the right upper quadrant was also seen consistent with a recent Whipple procedure.
She was started on erythromycin and Reglan to help with motility.
Intermittently, she was tried on clear liquid diet while she was being supported with total parenteral nutrition.
A CT scan was acquired on postoperative day #15 to rule out any abnormal fluid collection, abscess, etc to explain why she may in-fact be having difficulty with oral intake and nausea and emesis.
Her incision was clean, dry, and intact with Steri-Strips in place.
She will be encouraged to take her Boost supplements 3-4x/day and to watch her hydration status.
Outpatient medications included Cipro, Augmentin, Percocet.
Her discharge medication list will be the following:  Reglan 20 mg po qid ac and hs, Protonix 40 mg po q day, erythromycin 250 mg po q6.
The Reglan and erythromycin will be for procanetic agents.
She can take milk of magnesia 30-60 cc po q6 prn.
Additionally she can take Percocet 5/225 1-2 tablets po q4-6 prn pain as well as being recommended to utilize a stool softener, Colace 100 mg po bid, and Bisacodyl 10 mg pr q day prn.
