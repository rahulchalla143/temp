Admission Date:  [**2101-6-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-6-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2043-2-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3016**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath, bloody stool  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Foley catheter placement   History of Present Illness: 58 year old male with widely metastatic (including an infiltrating mass in his stomach) melenoma unresponsive to IL-2, s/p cycle 1 dacarbazine [**5-11**], admitted from the ED after reporting to an OSH with complaints of acute dyspnea.
He would invariably lose control of either his bowels or urine while on the floor while trying to catch his breath.
He was scheduled to see his oncologist for taxol infusion today, but this happened again so he was instructed to present to an OSH, where he was noted to have melena and a HCT of 24.
He was given 1 U pRBCs at the OSH and transferred here.
He added a stool softener about [**2-23**] days ago and subsequently had 5 bowel movements.
He was also given a dose of taxol on the day of discharge.
Hospice was discussed but he felt he wanted another round of chemotherapy to possibly prolong his life and alleviate symptoms.
GI was made aware and recommended NG lavage (not done downstairs).
Past Medical History: HTN COPD - used albuterol inhaler Metastatic Melenoma: symptoms [**12-29**] melena DX:[**2-4**] after UGI Bleed when endoscopy showed gastric mass, 2 moles on back bx and confirmed as melenoma.
TREATMENT: HD IL-2 here at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 86250**] (received 8 of 14 doses) and [**Date range (1) 86251**]/10 (received 9 of 14 doses).
2+ distal pulses.
Dyspnea/fatigue: On previous admission, his worsening dyspnea was felt to be due to his metastatic melanoma and he underwent debridement of his tumor (no stent).
Etiology for his dyspnea could include worsening of his pulmonary metastatic disease (CXR improved from previous in terms of his pulm effusion); pneumonia (CXR improved, no leukocytosis, currently afebrile); cardiac sources including MI (though EKG baseline and no CP); pericardial effusion (no rub, ECHO at OSH 3 weeks ago reportedly without effusion); shunt including vascular abnormalities related to tumor, AVMs, or PE.
However, he does not actually desaturate when he sits up, suggesting extrathoracic compression may cause some of his dyspnea, this degree of acute symptoms would be unusual.
Continued to complain of dyspnea with exertion, but had appropriate saturation on room air (94-95%).
- Continue to have patient work with physical therapy - Nasal cannula/supplemental oxygen as needed - Blood transfusions at least weekly (Hct goal >25)  #.
His PPI was transitioned to intravenous twice daily, and he was started on Carafate.
- If HD change or evidence of brisk bleed, GI to do emergent scope for possible source other than tumor - Continue Omeprazole 40mg twice daily for acid reflux and stomach ulcers - Continue Sucralfate 10-15mL four times daily to protect against the stomach ulcers - Continue Zofran and Compazine as needed for nausea/vomiting control .
His current medical care goals are comfort but will continue to receive palliative Taxol and blood transfusions (for dyspnea control).
He was given an 8 day course of levofloxacin for concern for postobstructive pneumonia, of which he completed.
Finished antibiotic course and remained afebrile.
Patient was started on tamsulosin for BPH with improvement of his symptoms.
Foley was discontinued 2 days prior to discharge and patient was able to void for a few days but then retained ~750ccs.
KUB was unrevealing and patient was started on rigorous bowel regimen.
