Brief Hospital Course: 85 yo M, Cantonese-speaking only with PMH of tracheostomy s/p laryngectomy, met prosate CA, thyroid CA, who presented with fever, hypoxia and new A-fib with RVR.
In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was started on pressor support with Levophed, intubated through his stoma for continued hypoxia, and an initial antibiotic regimen of Levofloxacin, Cefepime, Vancomycin.
Antibiotic regimen was then changed to Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levofloxacin during his first night of admission.
Following 2 days of fluid resuscitation pt was weaned of pressor support.
Following a negative MRSA screening pt's antibiotic regimen was narrowed to Zosyn and Levofloxacin and he completed a 10 day course of these antibiotics on [**2-18**].
# Pleural Effusions: Pt's CT scan showed bilateral pleural effusions, following completion of pt's antibiotics regimen and wean to minimal ventilatory support, diuresis therapy was initiated to aid with pleural effusion resorption.
Following 2 days of fluid resucitation pt was able to wean off his vasopressor.
He had to briefly be placed back on levophed, however he was quickly able to be weaned off again with IV fluid support.
On admission pt was noted to have a Hct of 15 and was transfused 2u of PRBCs and then another 2 units the day after admission.
Guaiaics were obtained and were ultimately negative, following transfusion pt's Hct was stable at 28-30.
Anticoagulation with Heparin SC was held following this finding.
After initially receiving Cefepime x 1 dose, several dasys of Vancomycin pt showed improvement on a narrowed regimen of Zosyn and Levofloxacin.
Given his clinical improvement a antibiotic course of 10 days was decided for IV Levofloxacin and Zosyn.
# New onset A-Fib: Pt was in the ED to be in new A-fib with RVR in the rate of 200s, pt's heart rate reverted to sinus rhythm following Diltiazem 10mg IV x 2, fluid administration and Metoprolol 12.5mg PO x 1.
# Acute Renal Failure: Pt's Creatinine noted to be elevated upon admission to a maximum of 3.0 from a baseline of 1.1-1.2.
Following aggresive fluid administration creatinine and urine output improved.
His PICC was removed, however anticoagulation was not started given a rectal sheath hematoma which was diagnosed the same day as well as bleeding around the site of a recently placed central line.
Long term anticoagulation was discussed and with his comorbidities, bleeding risk, and presentation of GI bleeding, it was decided not to start him on anticoagulation at any time in the future as the risk of bleeding is so high.
# Nutrition: Pt's albumin on admission noted to be low at 1.9, prior to admission to the hospital per pt and his family member he had poor PO intake several days before admission.
As pt was intubated and septic pt was initially started on tube feeds via NGT.
Given his poor nutritional status after discussion with the family a PEG was placed and tube feeds were ordered.
# Cancer: Pt has a history of papillary thyroid carcinoma s/p thyroidectomy and radiocative iodine ablation ([**2156**]), squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx s/p total laryngectomy ([**2156**]) and recently metastatic prostate cancer (Extensive osseous metastatic disease on PET scan in [**2163-9-22**]).
