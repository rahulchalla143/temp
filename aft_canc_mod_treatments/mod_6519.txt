**Sensitivity for bactrim added on on [**2113-8-26**]  .
Sigmoidoscopy [**2113-8-19**]: -Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids -Diverticulosis of the distal sigmoid colon, proximal sigmoid colon and distal descending colon -Blood in the rectum, sigmoid colon and distal descending colon -We did not find mass lesion during our procedure.
Colonoscopy [**2113-8-22**]: Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids Diverticulosis of the mid-descending colon, distal descending colon and sigmoid colon Blood in the descending colon and sigmoid colon Polyp in the mid-ascending colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum  Brief Hospital Course: 82 year old female with a history of stage [**Doctor First Name 690**] squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva and recent diagnosis of DVT on anticoagulation who presented from rehab with bright red blood per rectum.
Sigmoidoscopy and subsequent colonoscopy showed no source of bleed, just multiple diverticuli, which were thought to be the source.
Heparin drip was restarted in ICU, but upon transfer to the floors on [**2113-8-21**], she had additional BRBPR.
Even after heparin drip had been d/c'ed, she continued to have BRBPR, which excluded her as a candidate for future anticoagulation.
Surgery was consulted, but the patient and her family found that surgical resection was not in line with goals of care (as explained below).
Left Lower Extremity DVT: Patient recently diagnosed and started on heparin and coumadin for DVT.
Vulvar Cancer:  Patient is s/p radical vulvectomy and chemoradiation but recently with new pelvic mass and associated hydronephrosis and urinary tract infection.
She was maintained on her home dose of morphine PRN with good effect.
Pt started on Bactrim [**2113-8-20**] and to complete a ten day course for complicated UTI.
Bactrim was added to sensitivities on [**2113-8-26**] and should be followed up as an outpatient.
Goals of Care: Since anticoagulation could not be administered for DVT in the setting of GI bleed, goals of care were readdressed during this admission.
Medications on Admission: Colace Senna Morphine 7.5 mg PO Q4H:PRN Protonix 40 mg daily Ensure TID Heparin Coumadin  Discharge Medications: 1.
Morphine 15 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain.
Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole 160-800 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) for 5 days: continue until [**2113-8-30**].
Pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
Compazine 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for nausea.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Deep Vein Thrombosis  SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Your heparin was then stopped, but you cannot have anticoagulation for your leg clot because of your GI bleeding.
STOP taking coumadin (a blood thinner).
As we discussed, there is no further treatment for your clot.
A filter could not be placed your blood vessel to prevent a clot from going to your lungs.
You are on pain medication called morphine.
You should take colace and senna with this medication to help with constipation.
You must continue bactrim until [**2113-8-30**].
