HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2120-4-15**], status post a radical cystoprostatectomy, bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection, and orthotopic diversion (neo-bladder), performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The patient received two units of packed red blood cells.
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for initial postoperative monitoring.
He received 24 hours of SBE prophylaxis with Ampicillin and Gentamicin.
He remained with a nasogastric tube for bowel rest.
Of note, initially postoperatively he sustained a right anterior thigh numbness as well as right hip flexion weakness and right knee extension weakness, consistent with a femoral nerve stretch injury.
On postoperative day five, the patient's nasogastric tube continued to have a low output.
On discharge, postoperative day seven, the patient was discharged with his Foley catheter, bilateral ureteral stents, hooked up to one drainage bag as well as a second drainage bag hooked up to the suprapubic tube.
He was tolerating flushes through the suprapubic tube and out the Foley catheter without difficulty.
His midline incision was healing well with a small area of erythema and minimum drainage in the infraumbilical portion of the incision.
This was being treated with Keflex on discharge.
He was comfortable with his tube teaching.
He will follow-up on [**2120-5-1**], for removal of his bilateral ureteral stents as well as for removal of his surgical clips.
He will be discharged home with the Visiting Nurse Service to continue with the flushings of the suprapubic tube and out his Foley catheter.
Percocet one to two tablets p.o.
Keflex 500 mg p.o.
Colace 100 mg p.o.

His suprapubic tube will be flushed with 60 cc of normal saline and this fluid will be withdrawn from the Foley catheter twice a day.
