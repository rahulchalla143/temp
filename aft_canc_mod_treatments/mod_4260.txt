You were admitted to the hospital for operative repair of your Left hip fracture.
This irregular heart beat caused an increased heart rate that did not allow for your heart to pump efficiently; as such, we controlled your heart rate with a new medication as listed below.
We removed the port, started you on antibiotics to cover this infection, and eventually repaired your hip.
Your new heart rhythm was probably due to the infection, catheter and fracture, but will need to be followed by a cardiologist.
It increases your risk of stroke, so you were started on a medicine called coumadin to thin your blood and prevent clot formation.
For you infection you will need to complete a 4-week course of IV vancomycin (an antibiotic) and follow up with the infectious disease team.
Changes to your medications: To treat your Atrial fibrillation * Start metoprolol 100mg four times daily for your heart rhythm * START COUMADIN 2mg.
To treat your infection: * IV Vancomycin 1gm every 12hrs for total of four weeks (start date [**11-30**]) To prevent DVT * Start enoxaparin (lovenox) to prevent clots 40mg IV daily for total of 4weeks: start date: For pain control: - Start Morphine 15mg SR. Take one every 12hrs - Start Morphine 15mg IR, take one tablet every 4hrs as needed for pain.
