CXR [**2192-3-31**] The left-sided pigtail catheter has been removed.
Right-sided pig tail catheter remains in place.
Her respiratory status was stabilized via thoracentesis, pigtail catheter placement, and pleurodesis.
After careful consideration and thoughtful discussion, it was decided along with her children, that it was in the best intrest of Ms. [**Known lastname 90426**] to make her comfort measures only.
Patient was intubated in the ED and arrived to the ICU on mechanical ventilation.
Initial CXR demonstrated large bilateral pleural effusions with evidence of pneumonia, and she was started on vancomycin and cefepime for healthcare associated pneumonia.
She bit through the ET tube cuff pilot line on hospital day 6, and was extubated without complication.
# Septic Shock:  Patient was started on vancomycin and cefepime for presumed hospital acquired pneumonia.
She was aggressively fluid resusciated with IVF with a goal CVP of [**9-14**] mmHg and initially supported with norepinephrine infusion to maintain a MAP of > 65.
Norepinephrine was weaned on hospital day 6.
No changes suggestive on infarct on EKG, no all motion abnormalities on echo.
with pigtail catheter placement and pleurodesis was performed on [**3-28**] and [**3-30**]; the catheters were removed [**3-30**] and [**3-31**] with sats in the low 90s on 1L.
If her pulmonary disease is due to her peritoneal disease, paracentesis may need to be considered........... .
While she was in the ICU, she was started on HCAP coverage and she was given 8 days of vancomycin/cefepime ([**Date range (1) **]).
Upon arrival to the Oncology floor, given her recent fever, hypoxia, and unresolved leukocytosis she was restarted on Vanc/Cefepime ([**4-1**]) and Flagyl was added to cover for anaerobes in the case of aspiration.
IP requested avoiding anti-inflammatory meds as the inflammation is necessary for success of pleurodesis.
She was treated for HCAP as above.
