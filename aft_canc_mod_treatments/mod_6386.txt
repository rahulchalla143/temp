Percutaneous Biliary Catheter Cholangiogram/Exchange [**2162-10-19**]: FINDINGS: 1.
Existing 10 French modified pigtail drain patent in its intrahepatic component, but obstructed distally with no contrast drainage noted into the hepaticojejunostomy.
These do demonstrate some partial drainage of contrast at the end of the procedure.
Biliary drainage catheter in unchanged position, surrounded by a locally recurrent mass at the Whipple resection bed.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan:  This is a 52yo female with PMH of pancreatic cancer s/p whipple and with metastases to the liver who presents from home with fever, malaise, and leakage of fluid from around her biliary drain site.
# Biliary Drainage: Patient presented from home with blockage of external drainage from biliary drain and leakage of fluid from around the tube.
Her bilirubin was elevated on presentation likely from acute biliary drainage blockage and improved after the exchange.
However, following the tube exchange, she was noted to have decreased drainage.
CT abdomen was performed which revealed her biliary tube to be in good positions, however there are also multiple hepatic and uterine abscesses which may be due to hematogenous spread of pathogen or possibly superinfection of necrotic metasteses.
She will continue to use her biliary catheter at home as she did previously.
The likely source is biliary given the acute blockage of the drain associated with onset of symptoms.
She was continued on cefepime and flagyl in house with vancomycin stopped on HD#3.
As such, the decision was made to simplify her regimen to once daily ertapenem to provide adequate coverage for her polymicrobial bacteremia, as the only organism this would miss [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 34239**].
The possibility of drainage was discussed with IR, and it was decided that to do so would require 1 or 2 more drains to be placed, and it would be unlikely to be curative.
The etiology of her bacteremia being these multiple hepatic abscesses was discussed with the patient and her family, and a decision was reached to forgoe IR intervention, and to continue just with IV antibiotics and her home hospice care.
She has undergone surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy and has decided to pursue no further chemotherapy but has initiated hospice care.
Her CT scan after biliary stent replacement showed likely superinfection of necrotic metasteses in her liver, which is a very poor prognostic sign.
She will continue with her prior pain and nausea regimen consisting of hydromorphone and morphine prn, as well as ondansetron, compazine and lorazepam.
She will continue creon for pancreatic enzyme repletion.
# IDDM: The patient was maintained on her home glargine plus SS insulin in-house.
# ARF: Cr was elevated to 2.1 on admission, likely pre-renal azotemia.
She did not require supplemental oxygen at the time of discharge and does not experience any shortness of breath of dyspnea.

As you know, you were hospitalized when your biliary drainage tube became clogged.
Our interventional radiology team exchanged your tube which appears now to be draining properly.
You were found to have a serious bloodstream infection, which we started antibiotics to treat.
You should continue these antibiotics at home to help treat your infection.
We made the following changes to your medications: START Ertapenem (Invanz) Heparin flush Normal saline flush  Followup Instructions: You should follow up with your oncologist on an as-needed basis.
