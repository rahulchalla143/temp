Admission Date:  [**2112-11-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-11-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-11-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Morphine / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**] Chief Complaint: transfer for radiation oncology evaluation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation PICC placement [**2112-11-21**] tracheostomy, PEG, thoracentesis  History of Present Illness: 55 yo female with history of tobacco abuse and chronic back pain transferred from [**Hospital6 33**] for Oncology and Radiation Oncology evaluation.
Per the patient's family, she had been complaining of upper respiratory symptoms including nasal congestion, drainage, cough for approximately 2 months.
She was treated with antibiotics and antihistamines without relief.
On [**2112-11-8**], thoracic surgery performed a rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy which showed non-small cell lung cancer.
The patient was intubated initially for this procedure, extubated, but then developed respiratory failure 20 min later requiring reintubation.
Her sedation medications have included propofol, precedex, fentanyl and ativan.
Past Medical History: Non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed [**10-17**], SVC syndrome Scoliosis, chronic back pain s/p cholecystectomy s/p hysterectomy   Social History: The patient lives in [**State 108**] with her husband.
Family History: NC, no known lung cancer  Physical Exam: GENERAL: Intubated sedated in NAD HEENT: neck has dilated veins, plethoric, normocephalic, atraumatic.
NEURO:  Unable to assess given sedation PSYCH: Listens and responds to questions appropriately, pleasant   Pertinent Results: From [**Hospital6 33**] CT Chest [**2112-11-2**]:  RUL and RML collapse, central obstructing mass, large right pleural effusion, bulky right paratracheal, subcarinal, precarinal and lateral vascular adenopathy.
CT Abd/pelvis [**2112-11-6**]:  Large right pleural effusion, compressive atelecatsis, no liver lesions, no abdominal mass or adenopathy, 3mm right renal calculus, edema in the subcutaneous fat of the anterior chest wall as well as the right and left breast.
She had a high a-A gradient throughout admission that was felt to be secondary to shunt physiology with collapse of her right upper and right middle lobe.
She had a stent placed by IP on [**11-13**] to the right main stem bronchus to prevent further collapse.
She then had a tracheostomy/PEG placed on [**11-21**] as well as a thoracentesis of 1.2 L of pleural fluid.
On [**2112-11-22**], she was liberated from the ventilator but required further ventilatory support overnight on several instances.
If her respiratory function acutely worsens, would consider CXR to assess fluid status, diuresis with prn lasix and/or thoracentesis to drain pleural fluid.
She also likely may require ventilatory support to rest overnight occasionally.
Her settings were Volume Control TV 450, RR 16, PEEP 5, Fi02 50%.
She completed 4 doses of palliative XRT (400 cGy x 5 fractions) which was completed [**11-16**].
Medical oncology was consulted as well and offered chemotherapy as a possible option for the future.
She was started on IV steroids which were tapered gradually.
She was also started on a Heparin gtt due to an SVC and IVC clot which was transitioned to Lovenox on [**11-22**].
Her neck and facial swelling worsened from [**Date range (1) 84136**], and she was restarted on dexamethasone 4 mg [**Hospital1 **] with a plan to slowly taper down to a low dose (4 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 days then decrease to 2 mg [**Hospital1 **] (on [**12-1**]) and assess response.
She was given a total of 2 units of blood and her bleeding stopped.
GI did an endoscopy on [**11-25**] and found an ulcer which was injected with epinephrine and her hematocrit remained stable, although dropped slightly (2 points of the day of discharge).
She was continued on fentanyl initially and was transitioned to Dilaudid IV as needed however this caused delerium so she was changed back to oxycodone on [**11-26**].
She was also started on Methadone, but felt that this precipitated nausea and made her somnolent.
Consequently, she was changed to oxycodone 30mg PGT q4 standing, with oxycodone 30-60 mg PGT q2 prn.
The patient was only requiring 30mg Q2-4H at discharge and was tolerating this regimen well.
Anxiety: She had substantial anxiety and was managed with benzodiazepines scheduled and as needed.
At the time of discharge, the patient was maintained on standing klonopin with ativan prn for anxiolysis as needed.
Vomiting/Nutrition:  Patient had multiple episodes of vomiting without nausea during her radiation therapy.
However, the patient felt this vomiting was due to Methadone so it was stopped.
Tobacco Abuse:  Her nicotine patch was discontinued prior to discharge.
