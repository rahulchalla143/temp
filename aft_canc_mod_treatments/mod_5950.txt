In the PACU, the patient experienced tachycardia, low urine output, and hypotesion, for which he received a total of 1 liter in fluid boluses and albumin with good response.
Later, the patient was transferred to the floor NPO with an NG tube, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter and a JP drain in place.
He received a single dose of intra-thecal morphine prior to surgery with good pain control on POD#0.
Post-operative pain was initially well controlled with the intra-thecal morphine on POD#0 and then a Dilaudid PCA thereafter, which was converted to oral pain medication when tolerating clear liquids.
The NG tube and foley catheter were discontinued on POD#4.
Unfortunately, the patient was unable to void and the foley catheter was replaced.
Home dose of Flomax was restarted.
The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay.
When tolerating clears, he was restarted on his home hypoglycemic medications, with the exception of Januvia, which is not formulary.
