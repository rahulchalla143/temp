Regarding fevers, the patient has a history of Wegener's granulomatosis with treatment with prednisone (still on 5 mg q day) and Cytoxan (discontinued in [**2113-12-18**]) and several admissions for fever and neutropenia in the past.
He was started on levofloxacin two days prior to admission without significant improvement in symptoms.
There, he received a dose of vancomycin, gentamicin, ceftazidime and Flagyl in the Emergency Department.
The patient was given aspirin and sublingual nitroglycerin with improvement in his left sided chest pain from 6 out of 10 in severity to 1 out of 10 in severity in the Emergency Department.
Status post multiple interventions: Coronary artery bypass graft in [**2105**] with left internal mammary artery to the LAD, saphenous vein graft to the PL and saphenous vein graft to the PDA.
Multiple catheter procedures:  Stent x2 to the left circumflex, stent to the LAD, distal to the left internal mammary artery touchdown.
Saphenous vein graft to the PL was found to be widely patent.
Saphenous vein graft to the PDA was found to have 70% mid vessel stenosis.
The patient underwent stenting of the saphenous vein graft to the PDA with 0% residual stenosis.
The patient had been treated with prednisone and Cytoxan.
Myelodysplasia, receives transfusions every one to two weeks.
Epogen 40,000 units q week 2.
Carafate 1 gm q day 3.
Captopril 25 mg t.i.d.
Prednisone 5 mg q.d.
Amiodarone 200 mg q.d.
Lopressor 100 mg t.i.d.
Lasix 40 mg prn 8.
Vitamin E  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
These were stable compared with prior studies.
Electrocardiogram in the Emergency Department:  Sinus tachycardia at 100 beats per minute, axis 0, intervals normal with T-wave inversions in leads 1, AVL, V2 through V6.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy:  As will also be noted below, the patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy on or about [**8-24**] for evaluation of possible esophagitis, again in the setting of neutropenia and fevers, as well as a history of odynophagia.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2114-8-20**] with neutropenia, fevers, odynophagia and hypotension.
CARDIAC:  The patient ruled in for a non Q-wave myocardial infarction by troponin levels.
He was continued on captopril, Lopressor and Aspirin; subsequently, the aspirin was discontinued for very low platelet levels.
In terms of the patient's rate and rhythm status, the patient has a history of AT and NST; initially his amiodarone was discontinued upon admission for the possible risk of bone marrow suppression.
However, following cardiology consult, his amiodarone was restarted on [**2114-8-23**].
The patient initially received the above mentioned antibiotics in the Emergency Department.
His subsequent antibiotic regimen was tailored over the course of his hospitalization.
The patient received a course of ceftazidime, as well as a 14 day course of acyclovir.
The patient also underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy for evaluation of possible esophagitis in the setting of neutropenia and odynophagia; this study was likewise negative.
Thus, the patient was restarted on ceftazidime and started on vancomycin.
However, the patient continued intravenous vancomycin through the remainder of his hospitalization for treatment of the possible intravenous site infection.
The patient's right forearm intravenous site exhibited some tenderness, erythema and a palpable cord.
The patient was transfused several units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization; this was fully consistent with his periodic requirement for red blood cell transfusion related to the above noted condition.
However, because the patient had a history of having blast cells in his smears, the risk of possible conversion to AML was felt too high to warrant use of G-CSF at that time.
They advised continued use of prednisone 5 mg p.o.
Coronary artery disease, status post non Q-wave myocardial infarction 3.
Myelodysplasia  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  For the most part, the patient was discharged home on the above noted outpatient medication regimen.
Changes included the fact that his aspirin had been discontinued due to his low platelet count.
Linezolid to finish the course of intravenous vancomycin he had received.
The patient had received five days of vancomycin at the time of discharge.
Also, the patient was restarted on his amiodarone 200 mg q day; this was begun on [**2114-8-23**].
