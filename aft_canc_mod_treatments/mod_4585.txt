ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.
IMAGING / STUDIES: # CHEST (PA & LAT) ([**2176-6-10**] at 10:23 AM): IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs: Lobulation and enlargement of the left hilus is best explained by adenopathy, conceivably with some calcification but malignant until proved otherwise.
This nodal mass is difficult to measure due to absence of intravenous contrast, but is at least 3.3 x 4.2 cm and appears centrally necrotic.
Bronchial narrowing and irregularity on the left, which may be due to a combination of extrinsic compression and potential intrinsic airway involvement.
Correlation with bronchoscopy could be performed if warranted clinically.
Limited assessment of soft-tissue structures due to absence of intravenous contrast.
Plan to remove drain in 24-36 hours FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Stomach and duodenum are unremarkable.
Cytology [**6-17**]:    Lymph node biopsy   POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
# Lung Masses: The initial differential included a primary lung cancer, metastatic cancer, and tuberculosis.
IP was consulted for bronchoscopic biopsy, but early tamponade physiology was then noted on echo, and drainage of his pericardial effusion was considered more urgent.
Prior to discharge, additional staging workup was performed with MRI brain and CT abdomen/pelvis.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended drainage of the pericardial effusion, which was performed on [**2176-6-13**].
Subxiphoid pericardiocentesis was performed with removed of 140 ml of serosanguinous fluid with the procedure complicated by three unsuccessful needle sticks of the right ventricle.
Pericardial pressure feel from six to zero with pericardial fluid removal.
A pericadial drain was placed, and he was transferred to the CCU.
He remained hemodynamically stable, and the drain put out 250 ml of serosanguinous fluid.
The drain stopped putting out at 9am on [**2176-6-14**], and repeat TTE showed a very small pericardial effusion.
The drain was pulled around 7pm that night without incident.
# GERD: He reports a history of facial swelling after taking a medication for GERD in past, but was uncertain which medication.
He was not acutely symptomatic during his stay and no GERD medication was provided.
