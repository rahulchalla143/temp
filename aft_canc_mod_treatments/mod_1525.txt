She had been on gemcitabine chemotherapy for four cycles which had recently been held due to bone marrow suppression.
She is now status post modified radical with axillary lymph node dissection which revealed 17/34 nodes positive.
She is also status post cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, fluorouracil with radiation therapy in [**2178-12-17**].
In [**2183-7-17**], the patient was on Taxotere and also had an allergenic stem cell rescue.
In [**2184-8-17**], she had increased bony metastases and was started on Navelbine.
She was stable after that point until [**2185-6-17**] when she was found to have a large mass in her abdomen and underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
She also underwent bilateral ureteral stenting due to an obstruction.
She was then treated with Xeloda in [**Month (only) 216**] and [**2185-9-17**] and gemcitabine in [**2185**] every other week; with her last dose falling on [**2186-9-29**].
As stated above, treatment was complicated by recurrent thrombocytopenia and anemia.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Fentanyl 200-mcg patch, Percocet for breakthrough pain, Zoloft 100 mg p.o.
She did not require intravenous pressors; rather, her hypotension was controlled with intravenous fluid boluses and a blood transfusion.
In the Intensive Care Unit, in total, she received 6 units of packed red blood cells in addition to platelets and fresh frozen plasma.
Gastrointestinal was consulted; however, deferred an esophagogastroduodenoscopy due to the patient's thrombocytopenia and the risk of increased bleeding.
She was started on intravenous Protonix and Octreotide.
The Octreotide was discontinued on [**2186-11-6**], and the patient was transferred to the O-MED Service.
Haptoglobin was very low.
D-dimer and fibrin degradation products were both evaluated.
As the patient remained hemodynamically stable, there was no evidence of any clotting or any obvious bleeding at that time, no further intervention was done regarding the possibility of disseminated intravascular coagulation.
There was consideration to start antibiotics empirically, but that was not done.
She was transfused platelets occasionally as well as packed red blood cells to maintain her hematocrit in the mid to high 20s as necessary.
She was transfused a total of 3 more units of packed red blood cells after leaving the Intensive Care Unit.
GENITOURINARY:  The patient has had bilateral ureteral stents placed due to an obstruction from her abdominal mass.
Urology was consulted and replaced these stents on [**2186-11-9**].
Prior to stent placement, the patient had received both vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets in order to help reduce post procedural bleeding.
Status post procedure, the patient had a Foley catheter in place on continuous bladder irrigation and drained red urine for approximately 24 hours to 48 hours.
She was transfused platelets again and also started on Amicar for one 24-hour period to help stop the bleeding.
Following the treatment with Amicar, her hematuria did resolve, and her Foley catheter was removed once her urine was clear.
No further intervention was done.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Prior to undergoing the ureteral stent replacement, the patient was started on ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis and continued for a complete 7-day course following the procedure.
Because of that, the patient was placed on contact precautions for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
