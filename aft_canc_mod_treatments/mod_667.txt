Tip of the left PIC catheter can be traced as far as the right atrium but the tip is indistinct.
Pathology: Pericardial fluid: Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by a small population (2% of total events) of monotypic kappa light chain restricted B-cells.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo female admitted with chest pressure, found to have large pericardial effusion s/p drainage and also CAD with PCI in LAD s/p cath with 80% stenosis of LAD.
Equalization of her diastolic pressures and pericardial pressures were found.
Initially ~800 cc of serosanginous fluid was drained and a pigtail catheter was placed.
The catheter continued to drain fluid without evidence of recurrent tamponade.
Cardiac surgery was consulted regarding the need for a pericardial window.
# Lymphoma: The patient presented with the large pericardial effusion, diffuse lymphadenopathy, fevers, night sweats and weight loss.
She had drainage of her left pleural effusion on [**12-9**] with removal of 1200cc.
Her effusion rapidly reaccumulated and she was on an oxygen requirement.
At discharge, her ambulating sat was 100% RA and she was discharged on 40 mg PO Lasix QD.
She will continue on aspirin and plavix for a year.
We treated with lasix and started lisinopril.
As there was concern for anticoagulating her with the potential chemotherapy and pericardial window, attempt was made for cardioversion.
She was given two doses of ibutilide without success.
She underwent DC cardioversion and had successful return of sinus rhythm with one attempt.
# Anxiety: The patient has a long history of anxiety and has been receiving effexor xr and risperidone which she continued as in inpatient with prn ativan as well.
Psychiatry followed and made recommendations for her management (please see OMR notes for details).
Per psychiatry, she should not be discharged on ambien or ativan given her past psych history.
She was placed on a fluid restricted diet.
She also briefly was treated with hypertonic saline with slow and steady improvement in her sodium.
CT surgery felt there was concern for DVT, RUE U/S negative for DVT.
Her pain improved by [**12-12**] and switched to PO pain meds.
