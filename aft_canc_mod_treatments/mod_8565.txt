Admission Date: [**2112-5-5**]        Discharge Date: [**2112-5-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2056-6-11**]        Sex:  F  Service:  OME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer on Xeloda and Herceptin who presents with nausea and diarrhea.
As part treatment for this the patient started taking Imodium and noted a decreased frequency of diarrhea from four bowel movements a day to two bowel movements a day, but they were still liquidly in consistency.
Metastatic breast cancer first diagnosed in [**2101**] status    post auto bone marrow transplant in [**2104**], metastatic to    bone, liver, and lungs, status post multiple cycles of    chemotherapy.
Intravenous contrast.
Diarrhea:  The time course fits well with Xeloda toxicity.
Given concern for a possible infectious diarrhea    she was started on Levofloxacin.
In addition, the patient was given bicarbonate repletion and intravenous fluids to improve her metabolic acidosis.
The following day the patient was given broad antibiotic coverage as her neutrophil count was continuing to fall from the chemotherapy.
She was on ampicillin, Levofloxacin, and Flagyl for gut protection.
Patient was given a peripherally inserted central catheter line and started on TPN for parenteral nutrition.
The patient was started on Imodium for control of her bowel movements and over the course of her admission both the frequency and amount of stool declined significantly.
At this point she was intubated and brought    to the Intensive Care Unit for closer observation over the    next three days.
A Cardiology consult was obtained and they noted that her QT interval was significantly prolonged possibly due to Levofloxacin, and so she was initially changed to Cipro and then her antibiotic coverage was changed altogether.
In addition, she was started on low-dose beta blocker as VT prophylaxis.
She was initially started on sips    of clears and then graduated to thin liquids and then to    full liquids, which she tolerated exceptionally.
Hopefully, she will not need to be    maintained on TPN for that much longer.
