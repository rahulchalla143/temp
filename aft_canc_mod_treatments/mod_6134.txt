Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 54864**] is a 75M with metastatic renal cell carcinoma with known malignant right sided pleural effusion s/p recent drainage who presented with several days of right sided leg weakness, urinary retention for several weeks/months and constipation, with radiographic evidence of cord compression at the level of T5 as above.
1) Cord compression - Upon admission, Mr. [**First Name (Titles) 82581**] [**Last Name (Titles) 23156**] clinical signs of cord compression, including right leg paralysis and radiographic evidence of T8 cord invasion.
He underwent operative intervention on [**2119-10-22**] with decompression at the level of the T5 lesion, fusion T2-T8, laminectomies at T4 and T6, instrumentation T2-8, cage placement at T5, and autografting.
He was placed on a post-operative steroid taper, starting at dexamethasone 6mg IV q6hrs to be tapered down by 1mg q6hrs every other day.
2) Pleural Effusion - Patient was recently discharged after drainage of a recurrent malignant right pleural effusion and placement of Pleurx catheter.
4) Hypercalcemia - Calcium at admission 10.4.
Previous admissions with suspicion of etiology secondary to combination of bony metastases and paraneoplastic hypercalcemia, though no definitive work-up for PTHrP performed.
Managed well via intravenous fluids.
Relatively stable througout admission, though did exhibit increase in WBC count status-post initiation of dexamethasone therapy.
Expected to trend downwards with tapering of steroids as above.
6) Metastatic renal cell carcinoma - Had been receiving Genetech study drug, but discontinued on recent admission secondary to dyspnea and progressive disease.
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 54864**] is to follow-up as an outpatient for re-evaluation and initiation of chemotherapy.

Please take all medications as prescribed.
Refrain from driving while taking pain medication.
Please return to the hospital or call Dr.[**Name (NI) 9034**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3231**] if you experience any of the following: fever, chills, night sweats, loss of conciousness, chest pain, trouble breathing, opening of your incision, foul smelling or pus-like discharge from your wound, worsening back pain, increasing weakness, or any other symptoms that concern you.
Spine Surgery recommendations per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14354**] [**Name (STitle) **]: ??????
Take your pain medication as instructed; you may find it best if taken in the morning when you wake-up for morning stiffness, and before bed for sleeping discomfort.
Do not take any medications such as Aspirin unless directed by your doctor.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as pain medicine (narcotics) can cause constipation.
We recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.
Followup Instructions: You will have a follow-up appointment in approximately 2 weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 622**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17265**] to discuss chemotherapy options.
