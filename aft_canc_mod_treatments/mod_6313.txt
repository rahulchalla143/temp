The patient had a number of abnormalities on her ED labwork further complicating her presentation.
She was transferred to medicine for further management.

There is mention of submandibular and subclavicular lymph node enlargement on this study.
Arterial, portal venous, and delayed venous phases were also obtained after administration of IV contrast.
There has been previous splenectomy with surgical clips seen in the left upper quadrant.
[**2108-6-5**] Liver, needle core biopsies:  Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma, see note:  Note:  Tissue cores reveal predominantly a lymphohistiocytic/granulomatoid background with scattered large, atypical [**Doctor Last Name **]-Sternberg cells and variants (monolobated Hodgkin cells) with a small fragment of residual intact hepatic tissue at the edges.
By immunohistochemistry neoplastic cells express CD30, CD15 (dim/partial) and PAX5; CD20 and CD45 is negative (Block A).
Overall morphologic and immunohistochemical stains are in keeping with recurrence of patient's know classical Hodgkin lymphoma.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images through the chest were obtained without intravenous contrast and displayed at 5 and 1.25 mm of collimation.
Scattered mediastinal lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for enlargement.
The patient was kept in an upright position to minimize aspiration risk and 2 mg of IV Ativan were administered just after termination of the clonic activity.
[**2108-6-12**] HISTORY: Aspiration pneumonia.
[**2108-6-13**] IMPRESSION: Successful percutaneous transgastric jejunal tube placement.
The T-fastener skin sutures can be cut and released in seven to ten days.

[**2108-6-19**] PICC replacement by IR IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated fluoroscopically guided PICC line exchange for a new double lumen PICC line.
Right PICC line installed in good position.
Multiple liver hypodensities worrisome for metastases from lymphoma or other primary should be compared with same technique of prior abdominal CT. 6.
MRI is recommended to document evolution of blood products and to aid in the discrimination of an abscess  MR head with contrast [**2108-7-4**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Peribronchial opacification in the right mid lung is another candidate for pneumonia, unchanged since [**7-3**], and alternatively could be residual edema improved since [**7-1**].
Right PICC line ends in the lower SVC.
POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE PREPARATION (Final [**2108-6-18**]):       NO FUNGAL ELEMENTS SEEN.
In most populations, 90% of adults have been infected at sometime       with EBV and will have measurable VCA IgG and EBNA antibodies.
Antibodies to EBNA develop 6-8 weeks after primary infection and       remain present for life.
And then was treated for aspiration pneumonia.
She then began treatment for her cancer.
Her mental status improved and she was able to receive additional chemotherapy before discharge.
After she was stable, she received a PICC line and had treatment on [**6-21**] with gemcitabine 1400mg, vinorelbine 26mg, and Decadron 20mg.
Then on [**6-17**] she received the same tx plus liposomal doxorubicin 20mg.
She had G-CSF treatment on [**8-1**] and [**Date range (1) 20550**].
Therefore, she was restarted on chemotherapy with Doxil 17mg, Vinorelbine 26mg, and Gemcitabine 1400mg, Decadron 20mg on [**2108-7-13**], and will need her next treatment in [**5-15**] days after discharge depending on her nadir.
She will also likely need treatment with G-CSF as her ANC falls on [**7-16**] and [**7-17**].
Her out patient Oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 78640**] at [**Hospital3 15054**] will be contact[**Name (NI) **] and informed about her hospitalization and will likely administer her next dose of chemotherapy.
If her oncologist is unable to be contact[**Name (NI) **] she will need her next treatment as an outpatient at the [**Hospital3 **] clinic.
She was evaluated by neurology and she was started on levetiracetam 1500 mg daily, this was later changed on 500mg TID.
# Aspiration pneumonia - The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated transient hypoxemia that was believed to be aspiration PNA she was treated with levofloxacin and Flagyl initially.
She was diuresed with Lasix 20 IV with brisk response.
Her resp status improved with nebulizers and she was treated with levofloxacin.
Then after her last CT scan on [**7-5**] showed bilateral increased pleural effusions (worse on left) and bilaterally lower lobe consolidations she was switched to vancomycin and aztreonam.
She is on day 9 of both, she will need treatment for 6 more days, or until her cell counts recover.
Her mental status slowly improved after her chemotherapy which reenforced the diagnosis of a paraneoplastic syndrome.
On [**2108-6-13**] she was refluxing tube feeds through her nasogastric tube, and thus had a gastric-jejunostomy tube placed and tube feeds were initiated.
Therefore she was restarted on pureeded solids and thickened liquids, she will need follow up swallow study with video in [**12-7**] weeks.
She should slowly increase her PO intake and decrease her tube feeds.
Tachycardia may also be worsening her diastolic dysfunction leading to increased pulmonary congestion.
Her home Lopressor was held due to orthostatic hypotension.
# h/o ITP: Has been on a long taper of home prednisone.
Steroid therapy was discontinued per oncology recommendations at the beginning of her hospital stay and her platelets progressively fell to below 100,000.
She will need more chemotherapy in [**5-15**] days.
Her CBC, ANC, electrolytes, coags, and LFT's should be followed.

She will determine your next chemotherapy cycle.
You will also need treatment with GCSF as your white blood drops.
