Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to Red Surgery for management of her SBO and abdominal pain.
The patient was initially managed conservatively with NGT decompression and NPO status.
The patient continued on TPN as she was on at home.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications and an EBL of 100cc.
For further detail of the procedure please refer to the operative note.
On [**5-12**], she developed new AF w/RVR, was started on a dilt/lasix gtt, and an ECHO done was normal.
Furthermore, her Ucx was positive w/Ecoli so she was started on cipro and later changed to Gent [**2-26**] fluoroquinolone resistance.
The patient's discharge was delayed secondary to physical therapy concerns about the patient's independence status.
Furthermore, secondary to the patient's poor po intake, TPN was continued.
Upon discharge, the patient was afebrile with all vitals stable other than O2 saturation, ambulating on O2 independently, tolerating po feeds but still on TPN, and with pain controlled on po pain medication.
The patient progressed well with physical therapy, but the ultimate decision was made to d/c the patient home with oxygen [**2-26**] desaturations to the mid 80's on ambulation.
