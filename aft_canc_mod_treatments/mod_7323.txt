Tip of intravenous line in SVC.
Hypotension/GNR sepsis: The patient had his ERCP on [**9-7**] after which he was started on broad spectrum antibiotics (Amp/Gent/Levo).
A left subclavial line was placed and her was transferred to the ICU where he received more hydration and 2 units of PRBCs.
He was continued on broad spectrum coverage with Amp/Gent/Flagyl.
Once transferred to the floor, he continued to receive antibiotics and IV fluid for sepsis.
However, on [**9-8**] a CXR showed pulmonary edema/CHF and IV fluids were discontinued.
At this point the patient was tolerating fluids by mouth and remained well hydrated.
On [**9-10**] (Abx day 4) the patient's creatinine bumped to 1.1 from 0.6 and given gentamycin's nephrotoxicity, it was discontinued and ciprofloxacin was started.
The antibiotics were transitioned to oral dosing.
The ERCP fellow felt that this could be due to sepsis and liver metastasis and not necessarily indicative of a re-occlusion of the stented area.
However, given concern for fluid overload, IV fluids were held.
Therefore the patient was empirically started on stress-dose steroids and mineralocorticoids but these were stopped on [**9-9**] as BP elevated appropriately.
On [**9-9**], he reported that he was in increased pain [**2-22**] his narcotics being held (he usually takes oxycontin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] at home).
He was started on 30mg oxycontin with morphine IV for breakthrough and tolerated this well with improved pain control.
On [**9-10**] his pain regimen was changed: his oxycontin was increased to 40mg [**Hospital1 **] and his morphine IV was switched to oxycodone orally for breakthrough.
His hematocrit was followed during his hospitalization and was stable.
On transfer to the unit a foley catheter was placed and he was agressively hydrated with a return of good UOP.
The foley was discontinued on [**9-10**].
Gentamycin was thought to perhaps have played a role in the creatinine bump from 0.6 to 1.1 so it was discontinued and ciprofloxacin started as above.
DVT/PE: The patient was on chronic anticoagulation with coumadin, which was stopped prior to his procedure.
No vitamin K was given as he had a h/o PE.
He was not a candidate for further treatment.
Pain medications were added back during hospitalization after being initially held, his pain was well controlled on discharge.
Access: The patient had a R subclavian line placed on the evening of [**9-7**] just before transfer to the unit.
His central line was removed without difficulty on [**9-10**].
FEN: The patient was kept NPO in the unit and hydrated intravenously.
IVF was discontinued when his CXR showed evidence of pulmonary edema (see above).
Proph: The patient had pneumoboots, but was not given heparin SQ given his low platelets.
He was maintained on a ppi and had a RISS qid.
Nystatin swish and swallow was added to his oral fluconazole for treatment of thrush.
Code: The patient and family decided that his code status would be mechanical ventilation and pressors but no CPR.
