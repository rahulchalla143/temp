S/p right throacentesis with small residual effusion.
Thoracentesis drained ~2Lve cytology was positive for malignancy.
IP used U/S to assess need for Pleurex [**2171-7-26**].
but effusion was very small.Pt remained febrile during hospital stay, so abx changed from amoxicillin/clavulanate and azithromycin to ceftriaxone/azithro and then vancomycin and zosyn.
Family meeting discussed poor prognosis and limited options for treatment of malignancy.
However, continued treatment of acute illness was desired by family.
Thoracentesis drained ~2L.
Broadened coverage for bacterial pneumonia with ceftriaxone ([**2171-7-26**]) and azithromycin ([**2171-7-25**])followed by vanco and zosyn, without significant clinical benefit.CTA negative for PE and cardiac echo without evidence of heart failure.
After ruling out other possible causes contributing to hypoxia pt was transitioned to hospice care and discharged  home with hospice services.Pt was started on low doses of oral morphine to help alleviate symptoms of sob.
