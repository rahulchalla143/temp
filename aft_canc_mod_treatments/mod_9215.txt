Pt was initially treated with fluid boluses and blood transfusions in attempt to maintain intravascular volume and urine output.
Further fluids were eventually discontinued in the setting of massive ascites and third spacing with no improvement in her renal function from this intervention.
She was treated with broad coverage including vancomycin, levaquin and flagyl.
Patient received multiple therapeutic paracentesis in an effort to achieve greater comfort.
Patient did receive one dose of palliative chemotherapy, Carboplatin, at her request.
In the setting of end-stage ovarian cancer with multi-system organ failure the patient decided to be made comfort measure only and was transferred to the floor for further care.
#:Direction of Care: After discussing with patient her prognosis and options, the patient has decided it best to be made comfort measures only.
She was be treated with dilaudid and morphine for pain, and dyspnea, respectively.
Antibiotics eventually discontinued when patient made CMO.
# Renal Failure - Has been oliguric since [**11-11**] and was been temporarily responsive to IVF boluses.
Worsening Cr despite fluid resuscitation and pRBC transfusion.
Because of overwhelming ascites and third-spacing of fluids and the fact that patient continued to make urine at a constant, however minimal rate, fluid boluses were discontinued.
Albumin infusions were also administered q6hours for a 24 hour period in an attempt to minimize third spacing of fluid but discontinued when the patient was made CMO.
Downward trending HCT suggested that she was losing blood somewhere, likely source being her abdomen given her high RBC count in her paracentesis.
Further intervention besides transfusions were not felt to be possible.
# Pulmonary Embolism - Had an upper GI bleed on heparin so gtt discontinued and IVC filter placed on [**11-8**], LENI's negative on that day.
Continued SC heparin for prophylaxis for repeat PE.
# Ileus/Vomiting - Likely multifactorial contributed from recent surgery (pseudocyst marsupilization) and narcotics.
Also concerning for small bowel obstruction, however, abd CT and KUB did not demonstarte onstruction.
Followed clinically with abdominal exam and gyn/gen surgery input.
Patient had an NG tube in place for the majority if her stay.
Have was started on octreotide to try to limit pancreatic secretions and GI fluid accumulation in hope that she will have less nausea once the tube was pulled.
The tube was removed on [**11-20**].
Continued empiric IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].
She received one dose of palliative Carboplatin [**11-18**].
Palliative care involved Therapeutic paracentesis were performed for abdominal ascites.
# FEN/GI: - NPO, octreotide, IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].
Patient received TPN until made CMO # Pain: Dilaudid PCA # Code: DNR/DNI CMO    Discharge Disposition: Expired                               [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1016**] MD [**MD Number(2) 1017**]  Completed by:[**2129-11-23**
