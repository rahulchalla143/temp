No pleural effusions are seen; there is some pleural abnormality - thickening versus fluid - on the left.
Increased interstitial markings with some confluent areas in the right upper lobe; the sharp demarcation of this area is consistent with prior radiation therapy, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and additional history of throat cancer with prior radiation therapy was obtained.
CXR [**2103-5-7**]: A left-sided PICC catheter extends into the internal jugular vein with distal tip not visualized.
Although possibly due to evolving post- XRT changes given history of recent XRT therapy, correlation with portal suggested as well as comparison to outside studies would be helpful to exclude an acute infection such as TB developing in an area of radiation treatment.
This finding was discussed with IV nursing shortly after exam acquisition.
Brief Hospital Course: # Hyponatremia: Initially, placed on 3% saline infusion with improvement in sodium to 120s.
