Hematology/Oncology:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 48 year-old female with AML/M4 status post Ara-C and Doxorubicin chemotherapy complicated by thrombocytopenia and subsequent right frontal/ mid brain intracranial hemorrhage.
She was day +8 status post HiDAC consolidation chemotherapy at the time of the hospital course this dictation as describes.
Ms [**Known lastname 8285**] CBC was monitored closely following HiDAC chemotherapy secondary to her significant bleeding risks from thrombocytopenia as evidenced in the past.
The patient was maintained with a platelet count greater than 30 requiring multiple transfusions with cross matched and HLA matched platelets.
Her counts continued to trend downward after the HiDAC with a total granulocyte nadir on [**2154-12-26**] of 20.
The patient's platelets were maintained about 30,000 with transfusions as above.
Infectious disease:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] remained on AmBisome for the multiple rounded lesions within the spleen which were not significantly changed on repeat MRI examination on [**2154-12-4**].
It was felt that the utility of this scan would not significantly change therapy and the original plan to re-evaluate after the completion of AmBisome therapy was followed up.
She did have symptoms of a viral complex including nasal congestion, sore throat, and submandibular lymphadenopathy.
Nasal washings were obtained and a preliminary read was negative for RSV, influenza A and B, and anti-virus, and Parainfluenza.
