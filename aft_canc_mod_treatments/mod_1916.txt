L-spine, pelvis [**2201-7-1**]: Profound osteopenia and degenerative change.
Chest wall and mediastinum are unremarkable.
## Hypotension: The etiology of her hypotension was likely multifactorial in the setting of potential blood pressure medication changes, sepsis, or hypovolemia from poor oral intake.
She briefly required levophed and was aggressively fluid resuscitated with improvement of her blood pressures.
## Pulmonary edema: In the setting of aggressive fluid hydration, the patient developed hypoxia with pulmonary edema shown on chest x-ray and required BiPAP.
With diuresis the patient's hypoxia resolved.
## Leukocytosis: Patient was admitted with a WBC 21K.
She was started on antibiotics for possible pneumonia or sepsis in the setting of her hypotension.
## Vascular stenosis: Patient had uneven blood pressures in her right and left arm (left SBP 90s, right SBP 130s) concerning for aortic dissection in the setting of her low blood pressures.
Vascular surgery thought this was most likely due to arterial stenosis and recommended no intervention at this time as patient was asymptomatic.
Patient received decadron in the ED initially.
LH and FSH were indicative of post-menopausal status.
Her rhabdomyolys resolved resolved with hydration, and her creatine kinase and creatinine normalized.
## Acute on chronic kidney failure: Patient's creatinine was elevated on admission (3.0) from her baseline (1.6-2.1) likely secondary to prerenal azotemia.
Her creatinine returned to baseline with fluid resuscitation.
Patient was seen by physical therapy who recommended discharge with home PT.
# DM2: Patient had high blood sugars on this admission, so her Levemir insulin was increased to 16 Units at night.
Namely the medication adjustment that were made during this hospitalization was: 1) increase Levemir to 16, 2) continue cefpodoxime and azithromycin until [**7-7**], and 3) decreased lasix to 20 mg.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital6 1952**], [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: Fall, hypotension, community acquired pneumonia, hypoxic respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema, acute on chronic kidney failure, rhabdomyoloysis, diastolic heart failure, vascular stenosis  Secondary diagnoses: Hypothyroidism, insulin dependent diabetes type II, hyperlipidemia, gout, uterine fibroids, polio, hypertension  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
A chest x-ray showed possible pneumonia, so we treated you with antibiotics called cepodoxime and azithromycin.
In summary, when you leave the hospital, you will need to: - Follow-up with your PCP in one week to get the results of your urine sample, get bloodwork, and discuss any medication adjustments - Use your walker all the time - Observe the following medication changes: (1) During this admission you had high blood [**Last Name (LF) 32386**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] we increased your Levemir insulin to 16 Units at night.
(2) Continue your antibiotics cefpodoxime and azithromycin for 1 more day (last dose 5/24) (3) We decreased your furosemide dose to 20 mg because you did not have any leg swelling on this admission.
