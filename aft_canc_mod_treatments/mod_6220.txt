Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 23226**] was admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 1950**] 5 from the PACU s/p proctectomy, partial colectomy, coloproctostomy, diverting loop ileostomy.
He was admitted to the floor with a PCA, IV hydration, foley, and was made NPO.
The pt was also put on a CIWA scale secondary to his alcohol consumption at home, [**4-6**]+ tumblers of vodka/day.
The pt had been on CIWA scale and initially required ativan 0.5-1mg Q4hrs and then went up to 1-2mg ativan Q2hrs.
Delirium/ETOH withdrawal was controlled with IV benzodiazepines and Haldol.
The pt was continued on bowel rest and NGT to low intermittent suction.
# Presumed aspiration: Given that pt was vomiting on floor prior to arrival in ICU and also had vomiting while placing NGT in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with brief desaturation to 85%, pt has likely aspirated some gastric material.
- ppi to reduce acid pneumonitis - cipro/flagyl empirically .
The pt's NGT was d/c'd and with return of flatus and bowel function he was started on sips to regular diet advanced as tolerated, which he tolerated well and his medications were than changed back to oral.
Metamucil wafers TID, Imodium 4mg QID and IVF replacement was ordered.
With decreased ostomy output IVF was d/c'd.
However the pt will remain on metamucil wafer TID, imodium 4 mg QID, and Tincture of Opium.
The pt was still unable to void so a new foley was placed and the pt was sent home with a leg bag and a follow up appointment was made with urology for voiding trial on out-patient basis.
Visiting nurse services arranged for ostomy care and foley leg bag teaching at home.
