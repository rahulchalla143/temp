Admission Date:  [**2190-7-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2190-9-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2129-7-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: GYN  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7141**] Chief Complaint: vulvar infection  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p radical vulvectomy with groin lymph node dissection s/p left groin debridements x 2   History of Present Illness: 61 yo female who presented with a vulvar lesion on [**2190-7-15**].
No T/E/D  Family History: non-contributory  Brief Hospital Course:  On [**2190-7-27**], the patient underwent a D&C for postmenopausal bleeding.
On [**2190-7-30**], the patient underwent radical vulvectomy and bilateral groin lymphadenectomy with 3/6 right groin nodes positive for metastatic carcinoma ans 12 of 13 lymph nodes in the left groin were positive for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma with extensive extracapsular extension and obliteration of nodal architecture.
On [**2190-8-11**], the patient with taken back to the OR for a nonhealing left groin wound and underwent debridement and placement of a vacuum dressing.
On [**8-20**] she was taken to the OR for further debridement with Plastics surgery, followed by a placement of vacuum dressing since the tissue felt to be too necrotic for a flap.
The dressing was removed on [**8-27**] and the wound has been on wet to dry dressings since.
A large amount of lymph fluid drains from this, with increased pitting edema in her left lower extremity greater than the right.
After discussion with the pt and her family, it was decided not to pursue further treatment for this (including further debridement or debulking, or palliative chemotherapy).
It is not clear if this is merely tumor fever or if there is a superimposed infection despite different antibiotic regimens for more of her postoperative course, including Unasyn, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin and Zosyn.
Her WBC remains elevated (had peaked at 47 after her vac dressing was removed).
Her antibiotic regimen on discharge is Augmentin, Flagyl and Fluconazole PO.
She received pamidronate [**8-17**] with good response, but then her calcium again began to rise until she received another dose of pamidronate on [**9-1**].
This is presumably caused by bony metastases; it was felt that doing a bone scan, however, would not yield any information that would change her management.
