Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 58 yo female with newly diagnosed RCC with infiltration into the IVC and likely lung mets who presents with hematuria with transient urinary obstruction [**3-7**] clots and anemia.
1) Hematuria:   Patient with newly diagnosed renal cell carcinoma complicated by frank hematuria requiring transfusion at outside hospital.
A 22 french foley catheter was placed, and continuous bladder irrigation was initiated.
Due to her high clot volume and resulting bladder spasms, the foley became obstructed on multiple occasions, and occasionally was propelled out of the bladder due to spasms.
It required frequent manual irrigation to flush clots, in addition to continuous bladder irrigation.
*RCC: Given her symptomatic hematuria and hemodynamic instability, Urology was consulted for a nephrectomy during this hospitalization.
She underwent a radical nephrectomy with IVC thrombectomy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 261**] on [**6-25**].
Of note during the procedure her EBL was 2L and she received 5units of pRBCs with 6L of crystalloid.
She tolerated the procedure well and remained intubated post-op because of the large amount of fluid resucitation.
Her pain was then controlled with toradol and a dilaudid PCA.
On POD2 she was transferred out of the ICU and her chest tube was removed as no pneumothorax was seen on CXR.
She was treated with 2 days of bactrim preop and 3 days of ceftriaxone postop.
