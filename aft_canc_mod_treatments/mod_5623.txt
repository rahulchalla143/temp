HitAb neg but held on heparin for HIT I. DIC panel negative.
There were no known offending meds but did change ranitidine for protonix since it was only suspected med.
Hypotension-Pt had acute episode of hypotension with intial intubation which responded well to aggressive fluid boluses.
Pt had corasyn stim test to rule out adrenal insuffuciency which was equivocal at 18, so she was started on stress dose steroids.
She was also placed on fludricorisone due to an elevated potassium and low sodium.
Pt remained normotensive upon transfer to the floor on [**12-10**] and weaned off of steroids since there was no suspected reason for acute adrenal insufficiency.
SC heparin stopped for HIT possiblity and didn't anticoagulate initially due to brain mets although attending considering anticoagulation.
Improving on clotrimazole lozenges now that steriods stopped.
She was initially on RISS but this was discontinued with steroid taper.
