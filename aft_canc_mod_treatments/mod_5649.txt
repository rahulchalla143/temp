At 6 month follow up, the mammogram showed worsening of the calcifications, and she underwent a stereotactic biopsy.
She eventually underwent mastectomy of the left breast with axillary dissection.
She then had adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of Cytoxan, adriamycin, and taxol (her last taxol was [**11-10**]).
Since that time, she has been receiving Herceptin (has had 2 doses thus far, most recent dose [**2105-2-27**]).
She was initially evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic on [**3-6**] who thought the edema could be due to Herceptin (uncommon side effect) vs. CHF.
She presents for further management and work up of her fever and change in mental status.

This can be a side effect of her Herceptin therapy (not extremely common as per primary oncologist).
She was tried on Lasix without effect.
Initially, she was hemodynamically stable and started on Levofloxacin for ?UTI (she was febrile on admission).
She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics from presumed sepsis from RLE cellulitis, fluid resuscitated, on pressors, and started on stress dose steroids (completed a 5-day course).
Dermatology was consulted regarding LE cellulitis and recommended covering for pseudomonas given the appearance (?echthyma gangrenosum), so she was changed to Vancomycin/Zosyn.
Aggressive diuresis was continued on the floor (she was grossly volume overloaded s/p fluid resuscitation in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]).
Her LE edema and cellulitis slowly improved with this care, and she was continued on Zosyn/vanco until discharge.
She was discharged on Augmentin/Levofloxacin, to finish a 14 day course of antibiotics (or until cellulitis resolved).
The etiology of this new heart failure was not determined (unlikely to have been solely the effect of her Herceptin therapy).
She was discharged on 80 mg PO Lasix with potassium supplementation.
This lasix will need to be tapered as her edema resolves, and her Potassium will need to be monitored given this lasix therapy.
Lethargy/Delta MS: According to her family, she has been progressively lethargic this week and is confused as compared to her baseline.
Her mental status improved after she was treated for her sepsis.
Inflammatory Breast Cancer: she is s/p mastectomy, XRT to brain, chemotherapy, and is currently on single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] therapy with Herceptin.
Her Herceptin therapy was held in-house secondary to her new heart failure.
She was started on Arimidex, continued on her Decadron (after completing 5-day course of stress dose steroids) and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in oncology clinic).
A slow taper of her Decadron was started in-house (taper by 1 mg, every four days).
The need for further decadron treatment will be determined by her primary oncologist.
She was discharged only on Arimidex, and she will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who will determine the possibility of further chemotherapy with Herceptin.
HTN: Atenolol and HCTZ were initially held while in-house due to her hypotension and sepsis but were started prior to discharge with good blood pressure control.
Lisinopril was also added to her medication regimen.
CV: no evidence of CAD or CHF, but recent Herceptin therapy could cause this undesirable SE.
Dispo: She was discharged to home with VNA services on PO antibiotics (Augmentin/Levofloxacin) after her RLE cellulitis had sufficiently improved.
She will complete a 14+ day course of antibiotics, continue local wound care.
