Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Paracentesis, G-J tube placement with flouroscopy.
History of Present Illness: HPI: 69 y/o female with a h/o pansensitive TB on 3 drug regimen, MDS with pancytopenia, respiratory failure s/p trach placement and revision [**5-/2147**], recently discharged [**2147-6-30**] with sepsis presumed [**12-23**] PNA (by MDR E coli, pseudomonas) who comes in from [**Hospital3 **] with tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension.
She also had a new PICC tube placed yesterday for additional access as her one PICC line was deemed inadequate.
She received vanco/cefepime and flagyl and a 500cc NS bolus.
2L NS given.
ID was curbsided and advised to give Meropenem iv, Tobramycin IH, Cipro iv, and Dapto iv was started.
Also, VRE from cath tip on [**6-21**], started on Daptomycin, however, daptomycin was discontinued due to negative blood cx for VRE on [**6-23**].
Tobramycin was added on [**6-19**] for double coverage of resistent pseudomonas given poor lung penetration of Cipro.
The full course of meropenem was completed on [**7-2**] and of tobramycin on [**7-3**].

PNEUMOSEPSIS: The patient presented with fevers, tachycardia, tachypnea and hypotension.
Of note, she had a history of MDR pseudomonas and ESBL E. coli for which she completed a 14-day course of meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and inhaled tobramycin on [**2147-7-3**].
In the emergency room she was started on vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl; on transfer to the MICU, the ID consult service recommended a switch to daptomycin for a potential line infection, meropenem and inhaled tobramycin for her previous MDR lung pathogens, and Flagyl for empiric coverage of Clostridium difficile.
Her PICC line was also removed.
She briefly required Levophed for pressure support but was quickly weaned after arrival in the MICU.
Sputum sample from [**2147-7-23**] grew out pan-sensitive Serratia and 2 strains of Pseudomonas, for which she was started on a 3-week course of inhaled tobramycin and ciprofloxacin that completed on [**8-11**].
At the time of her most recent discharge it was noted to be 2.6 and it was felt that the patient had renal damage secondary to recurrent exposures to nephrotoxic medications and hemodynamic instability.
On admission, the worsening from this baseline was thought to be due to acute renal failure from hypotension; her creatinine improved with IV hydration to 1.3.
She was started on meropenem on [**8-6**] with plans to complete a two week course for a complicated infection; the finish date is [**8-20**].
On admission, she was taking sodium bicarbonate 650 mg PO QID with a resultant bicarb of approximately 13.
Her bicarb replacement was decreased to her original dose.
Pathogen-directed antibiotics appear to have resolved these infections; they have not, however, significantly affected her fever curves.
She has a permanent tracheostomy since around [**Month (only) 958**] of this year.
Her dead space ventilation during this admission was calculated to be greater than 75%.
During this admission, she has persistently required assist control ventilation.
She has been able to tolerate trials of pressure support for only short periods of time, but eventually becomes tachypneic over her already elevated baseline.
G-J TUBE:  Two days prior to her admission, the patient's G-tube fell out and was replaced with a Foley catheter.
A few days prior to discharge, the balloon from this tube was found to be outside of the abdominal skin.
Thoracic surgery has recommended that this drainage be controlled by placing an ostomy bag over the tract site until the canal heals itself and re-seals against the G-J tube.
This was initially attributed to sepsis given her presentation.
She was started on thiamine out of concern that nutritional deficiency might be contributing.
She underwent ultrasound guided paracentesis on [**8-10**].
The patient is completing a two week course of meropenem for her urinary tract infection and completed a three week course of ciprofloxacin and inhaled tobramycin for pneumonia.
She is also taking tuberculosis medications.
After discussion with the ICU team, it was decided that increasing antibiotic coverage at this time in not appropriate.
Her increased INR has been attributed to malnutrition and prolonged antibiotic use.
Vitamin K was given for 5 days during this admission, but only provided minimal improvement.
MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROME: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia and anemia and is transfusion dependent for platelets and red blood cells.
Past studies indicated that she may be progressing to AML, but the hematology/oncology service felt that she was not a candidate for chemotherapy due to her otherwise poor health.
During this hospitalization, she received numerous blood products for transfusion goals of platelets greater than 10 and hematocrit greater than 21.
She has tolerated these well and will continue to need blood products at her rehab facility on a regular basis.
She is currently taking isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide since [**2146-12-22**].
Per ID's recommendations, she will require continued therapy with these three medications until [**2147-9-20**] and will not require a follow up ID visit.
Her outstanding acid fast bacteria cultures, including blood, sputum, and peritoneal fluid, will be followed by the patient's PCP.
She was continued on albuterol and Atrovent MDIs during this admission with good effect.
During this hospitalization, she was maintained with success on insulin sliding scale.
PROPHYLAXIS: The patient has a history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia.
For this reason, she did not receive subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
She has been maintained on a PPI for GI prophylaxis.
