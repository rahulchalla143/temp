# Pancreatic cancer:  The patient completed a course of chemoradiation with 5-FU and EBRT on [**11-11**] which included 5 endoscopic US-guided intratumoral injections of TNFerade.
His pain was treated with morphine as needed, his nausea with zofran and prochlorperazine prn.
General surgery reviewed his CT scans with radiology and did not see any compelling signs of vascular invasion or varices that would explain his massive hematemesis, although CT has low sensitivity for this diagnosis.
The heparin gtt which had been started for his PEs was stopped and he was transfused with two units of PRBC.
On the floor, the patient had 3 bloody bowel movements, his family reversed his CMO status, he received 3 units of blood and had no further episodes of bleeding.
# Diabetes: The patient is on glipizide as an outpatient.
He was initally covered with SSI, however as he is CMO, fingerstick monitoring and insulin have been stopped.
# Sacral dcubitus ulcuer: The patient has a known decubitus ulcer and received VNA-wound care services at home.
# Anasarca: The patient was on aldactone and lasix as an outpatient for anasarca that was thought to be related to malnutrition.
His diuretics were held given his recent hypotension.
# FEN:  The patient was started on TPN as dysphagia has been a significant problem for him.

You had one more bleeding episode and required a blood transfusion.
We believe the bleeding is from erosion of your tumor into your GI tract and no further interventions are indicated.
