- As speciation of agents was an extended period and there the sepsis was severe, the decision was made to treat broadly with antibiotics to cover GNRs, anearobes and staphylococcus with vancomycin/zosyn (renally dosed) which was ultimately transitioned to unasyn IV after discussion with the ID team.
A PICC line was placed for this indication.
-agressive fluid hydration for early goal directed therapy, bolus prn for SBP <100, UOP <30 or elevated lactate.
Given likely infection, ARF probably represents pre-renal physiology vs ATN from hypotension/Shock, or much less likey AIN from recent antibiotics use.
- Agressive hydration - improved slowly during the admission - All medications were renally dosed  3.
Masive Sacral Decubitus ulcer: - Has rapidly enlarged over past 2 weeks despite wound care at home, now with foul odor, purulent discharge and large eschar, does appear to track, unclear if goes to bone.
- Kinair bed was obtained as wound was markedly moist - plastic surgery debrided at bedside once, waited for INR to decrease for further debridment, which was repeated when the INR was 1.7 on [**6-14**].
Plastic surgery was consulted again, and sutures were placed for hemostasis.
[**Hospital1 **] chemical debridement was recommended for ongoing wound care.
- Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia, however despite return to euvolemia his sodium remained low, so nutrition was reconsulted to calculate a new free-water regimine with his tube feeds.
With the new regimen his sodium corrected to normal on [**6-14**] -hydration overnight --> improved with hydration; pt.
Essential thrombocytosis: - hydroxyurea was cointinued - His coumadin was held for coagulopathy, as the risk of bleeding from debridement was higher than thrombosis risk.
Anemia of acute blood loss (at wound debridement) - managed with blood transfusions.
Coagulopathy: On coumadin for h/o stroke and essential thrombocytosis.
- monitor for bleeding - held coumadin until INR <2,  can be restarted once no evidence of ongoing bleeding.
Severe Malnutrition - Nutrition consultation was obtained - Tube feeds were continued, although this markedly is impairing wound healing  11.
CAD: - No ischemia on ECG - Continue ASA, statin - Beta-blocker was held in setting of possible sepsis.
Parkinson's Disease: - continued sinemet, methylphenidate  ## Prophylaxis: Heparin SC 5000 tid  ## Code status: DO NOT RESUSCUTATE FOR PULSELESS ARREST (no compressions or shocks) - whould want intubation for respiratory arrest/distress.
to be maintained until [**Hospital1 **] graduations in several weeks after which time consideration of palliative approach will be readdressed.
