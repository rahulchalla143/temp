Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation at outside hospital RIJ placement at OSH and replacement at [**Hospital1 18**] Lumbar Puncture NGT placement GJ tube placement  History of Present Illness: A 68 year-old female with history of cerebrovascular accident x 3, left tonsillar carcinoma, no known history of seizures presenting to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital [**2113-11-30**] with new onset convulsive seizures.
Potassium on admission was 2.2, with magnesium 1.7 and other electrolytes within normal limits.
She has been treated with phenobarbital, fosphenytoin, intermittent ativan, and a midazolam drip for her seizures.
Chest x-ray after intubation showed a developing infiltrate at the right lung base, which improved on subsequent imaging.
Infectious evaluation including BAL at the time of intubation, urine, and blood cultures were negative at the time of discharge - she never underwent lumbar puncture.
She was initially treated with ceftriaxone and clindamycin for aspiration pneumonia.
A RIJ was placed [**12-2**], and due to her fevers, a LIJ was attempted but unsuccessful; the RIJ remains in place.
Her antibiotics have been changed to zosyn and linezolid at some point prior to transfer.

CXR: [**2113-12-8**] The nasogastric tube is appropriately positioned 2.7 cm above the carina.
The right internal jugular central venous line tip overlies the SVC.
The nasogastric tube has been appropriately advanced.
The left internal jugular central venous catheter seen on [**2113-12-15**] has been removed.
There were electrolyte abnormalities on admission, however, the patient persisted with seizures after correction.
Home medications not known to contribute to seizure activity.
EEG without seizure and phenobarbital was discontinued [**12-9**].
MRI no evidence of encephalitis, so acyclovir discontinued.
Patient placed on heparin gtt and transitioned to coumadin on [**12-16**], but it was stopped for PEG placement and re-started on [**2113-12-20**] at 2.5 mg Daily.
Please stop phenytoin in 4 days and contine Keppra at current dose.
RIJ in place since [**12-2**] without erythema or discharge.
Patient initially on diflucan, ceftriaxone, and clindamycin for aspiration, but changed to zosyn and linezolid at some point prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
However, since AMS and fever made high the suspicion for infection patient was treated empirically with Vancomycin, ceftriazone, ampicillin.
Antibiotics were stopped on [**2113-12-14**] and has been afebrile since then.
# Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting of aspiration.
Was treated for aspiration pneumonia with ceftriaxone and clindamycin for an unknown course.
# Atrial flutter: Rate-controlled with digoxin and diltiazem.
Continued digoxin and for rate control.
On heparin gtt and was started and therapeutic on 2.5 mg of coumadin, which was stopped for PEG placement.
Since patient has documented chronic AFib, we do not think she will benefit from ablation at this point, and she will still require anticoagulation for secondary stroke prevention.
Patient was guaiac negative and with ferritin of 1159 suggesting anemia of chronic disease.
# FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, Tube feeds throug PEG as continuous.
# Prophylaxis: Heparin gtt and coumadin; bowel regimen, PPI.
