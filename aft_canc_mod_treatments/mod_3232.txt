He has squamous esophageal cancer and has completed neoadjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and radiation.
He has had a jejunostomy tube and venous access device placed in the past and was receiving tube feeds at home during his treatments.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History:  Squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, s'p XRT and chemotherapy ?Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation  Past Surgical History:  Laparoscopic placement of feeding jejunostomy tube and venous access device  Social History: Moved from [**Country **] 4 years ago and lives with his son in [**Name (NI) 3786**].
Walks with a cane at baseline.
PROCEDURES:  Minimally invasive esophagogastrectomy, bronchoscopy and esophageal gastroscopy.
INDICATIONS:  This gentleman has a mid esophageal squamous cell carcinoma that has been treated with neoadjuvant treatment.
He presents now for surgical resection.
PREPARATION:  In the operating room, the patient was given general endotracheal anesthetic.
Intravenous antibiotics were given.
Heparin was given subcutaneously and pneumatic boots were placed.
BRONCHOSCOPY:  We initially performed a bronchoscopy through a single-lumen tube.
THORACOSCOPY:  The tube was then changed to a double-lumen tube.
There was a flex placed on the table and the right thorax was then prepared with Betadine solution and draped in the usual fashion.
In the subcarinal packet there appeared to be 1 or 2 nodes which were distinctly different which probably had been involved with tumor at one point in time.
The lymphatic tissue was taken off of the pericardium and off of the inferior pulmonary vein on the right which was seen easily.
This was somewhat sticky from his treatment but we were able to safely work our way all the way up into the neck from below.
Our Penrose drain was then placed at the thoracic inlet.
Another Penrose drain was then placed around the esophagus and we used this to work downwards, dissecting the area off of the left inferior pulmonary vein which was also seen clearly.
However, a complete lymph node dissection was performed of the tissue off of the aorta.
The remainder of the dissection was performed with Harmonic scissors.
A Penrose drain was then kept in this area.
The #28 chest tube was placed as well as [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain.
LAPAROSCOPY AND NECK DISSECTION:  The patient was placed in the supine position and the tube was changed to a single- lumen tube.
The neck left neck and abdomen were prepared as well as the chest with Betadine solution and draped in the usual fashion.
Two #5 ports were placed on the left inferiorly and a #12 dilating port was placed in the left more superiorly.
Number 12 ports were placed laterally on the right for retraction as well as one in the mid-clavicular line for dissection.
This was done with Harmonic scissors.
We then formed our gastric tube with multiple runs of the [**Female First Name (un) 3224**] stapler using thick tissue staples.
The width of the tube was approximately 7-8 cm.
We were able to retrieve the Penrose drain which had been placed through the previous thoracoscopy.
The nasogastric tube was placed through the esophageal hole for easier placement through our anastomosis.
Tacking sutures were placed on the esophagus and stomach.
The nasogastric tube was then placed through our anastomosis which was quite large.
CLOSURE:  The neck was closed with interrupted sutures of 3-0 Vicryl to the fascial layers and the skin was closed with a stapling device.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was placed through the neck incision through a separate stab wound.
Steri-Strips, dry sterile dressings were applied.
The patient was then sent to the Intensive Care Unit still intubated with plans on extubation shortly after tolerating the procedure well.
DRAINS:  One #28 chest tube to the right chest.
One #24 chest tube to the left chest as it was seen to be violated during our last part of our laparoscopic dissection.
I certify that surgeons of 2 separate specialties were required for this entire procedure which was quite complex.
