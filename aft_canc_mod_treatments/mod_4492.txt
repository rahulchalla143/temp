In an attempt to prevent further episodes she should continue on her PPI, hold her aspirin (indication: stroke primary prevention), and her oncologist will minimize nausea/vomiting with chemotherapy.
Atrial Fibrillation  - maintained in sinus rhythm despite missing a few doses of Verapamil on arrival due to hypotension; continued on Verapamil at discharge  2.
