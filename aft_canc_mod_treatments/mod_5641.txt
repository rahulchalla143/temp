The patient is currently POD 11 s/p emergent left craniotomy on [**2-25**].
An EEG showed evidence of non-convulsive seizures, and she was loaded with Levetiracetam 1 gm and continued on 500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Lorazepam was started at 1 mg po q6h standing and ASA 325 mg was started.
Phenytoin was increased to 150 mg tid, Lorazepam was discontinued.
An infectious workup was initiated with CXR, UA, and blood cultures.
The UA on [**3-5**] returned positive, and the foley was discontinued and a repeat UA/UCx were sent.
On [**3-6**], the patient's NGT was pulled and diet was advanced after the patient had a speech and swallow evaluation that recommended pureed solids and thin liquid.
However, the patient's nurse felt that the patient had a potential aspiration event and she was placed back on NPO and NGT was re-placed.
Tube feeds were re-started pending a repeat speech and swallow evaluation.
She was loaded with Amiodarone post-op, but this was subsequently discontinued due to bradycardia, and she has been in atrial fibrillation/flutter since.
Her home Metoprolol was re-started on [**2-28**].
Her Metoprolol was increased to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] for rate control and she was started on a Heparin bridge on [**3-6**] per EP recs, but the primary team did not re-start Coumadin at that time.
She was given Lasix 20 mg IV on [**3-2**] for pulmonary edema with good urine output.

[**2161-2-26**] CT head postop: Status post right frontotemporal craniotomy with evacuation of subdural hematoma.
[**2161-3-2**] Chest Xray: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been removed.
The right subclavian catheter is in unchanged position.
[**3-3**] CXR: Compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a nasogastric tube.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 66 year old female with HTN, DLP, atrial fibrillation/flutter on coumadin, coronary artery disease s/p DES to LAD [**2153**], h/o CVA in [**2140**] with mild aphasia, rheumatic mitral stenosis s/p vavuloplasty, history of colon cancer s/p resection, anxiety who initially presented on [**2-25**] with a severe headache and dizziness, found to have a large left subdural hemorrhage, s/p emergent left craniotomy.
# Subdural Hemorrhage:  The patient presented with a headache and dizziness for one day in the setting of anticoagulation on Coumadin.
She was given profiline 9 and vitamin K and taken emergently to the OR on [**2-25**] for a left craniotomy for evacutaion of L SDH.
On POD3 ([**2-28**]), EEG showed frequent seziure activity in the left spreading to the right, and Dilantin was increased, Keppra load was given, and Keppra and Ativan were started.
She was continued on Keppra and Dilantin, and has been having daily Dilantin levels which were corrected for her low albumin.
On [**3-5**], staples and sutures were removed, and on [**3-6**], EEG leads were removed.
Since transfer to the medical service on [**3-7**], the patient has remained stable per Neurosurgery evaluation and repeat CT head on [**3-9**] in the setting of full anti-coagulation (on Heparin gtt for afib/flutter).
She is being discharged on Keppra and Dilantin with follow-up with Neurology and Neurosurgery.
She will be continued on Ampicillin 500 mg PO crushed in apple sauce for a 14 day course (d1=[**3-7**], last day on [**3-21**]).
The patient may be having thrombocytosis secondary to medications (new medications include Ampicillin).
It is also possible the patient is having rebound thrombocytosis following her episode of thrombocytopenia at the time of her craniotomy for the subdural hemorrhage.
She also had post-operative seizures and was started on Keppra and Dilantin with Neurology following (see above under Subdral Hemorrhage).
She was started on Ampicillin on [**3-7**], and sensitivities to the Enterococcus showed it was sensitive to Ampicillin.
Her mental status improved significantly since initiation of antibiotics for her UTI and her delirium cleared.
She had episodes of tachycardia requiring additional doses of Metoprolol, and her standing dose was progressively increased with improved heart rate control.
She is being discharged on Metoprolol Tartrate 100 mg TID with good heart rate (and blood pressure) control.
She will have outpatient follow-up with her cardiologist, and Metoprolol was increased to Metoprolol Tartrate 100 mg TID.
The patient was also started on a Heparin bridge on the Neurosurgical service on [**3-6**], and Coumadin was started on [**3-7**].
The patient's Coumadin dose was increased from 3 mg daily to 5 mg daily on [**3-9**] for persistent sub-therapeutic INR's.
# ?Aspiration:  Post operatively, the patient had been on tube feeds througn an NG tube.
She subsequently passed her speech and swallow evaluation while on the Neurosurgical service, but when she was started on a PO diet, nursing had concerns regarding aspiration given coughing episodes with drinking water.
She subsequently was felt to have significantly improved swallow with pills and her delirium had resolved, so speech and swallow was reconsulted for re-evaluation on [**3-12**].
She was cleared for a diet of nectar thickened liquids and pureed solids, with plan for re-evaluation in the future when she is further out from her craniotomy.
#Hypertension:  On home Losartan and Hydrochlorothiazide, as well as increased dose of Metoprolol as detailed above for tachycardia with blood pressures within goal.
Home Lisinopril was held in-house and the patient remained normotensive with the increased Metoprolol off the Lisinopril.
#Coronary artery disease:  Patient status post LAD Cypher stent in [**2154-8-15**].
She was continued on Aspirin and Metoprolol.
#Hypercholesterolemia:  Continued home Lovastatin 20 mg daily.
#Anxiety Disorder:  Patient on Gabapentin as an outpatient, presumably for anxiety vs chronic pain.

You underwent an emergent surgery called a craniotomy to drain the blood from your brain.
You were noted to have seizures following your surgery, which sometimes occurs after bleeding in the brain, and you were started on two medications to prevent further seizures.
One of these medications, called Dilantin, will need to be monitored weekly with blood draws of your dilantin level and albumin level to determine whether the dose needs to be adjusted.
You were treated with antibiotics with dramantic improvement of your confusion.
You will remain on the antibiotics for a 14 day course.
You are therefore at risk of aspiration, which occurs when food that you swallow goes into your lungs instead of your stomach.
After several evaluations by the speech and swallow therapists, you were started on a modified diet with nectar thickened liquids and pureed solids to decrease your risk of aspiration.
You will be on Lovenox shots temporarily until your INR becomes 2.5-3.0, at which point you will continue Coumadin and stop Lovenox.
The following changes have been made to your home medications: - Ampicillin was STARTED, to be taken until [**2161-3-21**] - Keppra was STARTED - Dilantin was STARTED; please adjust dose as instructed based on your weekly dilantin and albumin levels - Oxycodone was STARTED, to be used as needed for post-operative pain - Docusate and Miralax were STARTED to help regulate bowel movements - Metoprolol was INCREASED to 100 mg TID until follow up with your cardiologist - Coumadin was INCREASED; please adjust as directed based on your INR - Lovenox was STARTED, to be used until your INR is above 2.4 - Insulin sliding scale was STARTED, to be used at rehab; please discuss with your primary care physician whether you should continue to be on insulin when discharged from rehab - Omeprazole was SWITCHED to Ranitidine until you are able to swallow pills whole without needing them crushed - Gabapentin was stopped initially in the hospital but RESTARTED on discharge - Lisinopril was STOPPED; please follow up with your primary care physician prior to [**Name9 (PRE) 18290**] this medication For your post-surgical care, please following the instructions below: ??????
Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
You may wash your hair after sutures and/or staples have been removed.
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Advil, and Ibuprofen etc.
Because you are taking Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
