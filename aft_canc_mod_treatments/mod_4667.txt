ICU Course: Patient was transferred to ICU for hypoxia, hypotension, and oliguria on [**2133-10-7**].
Initially received 1L fluid bolus for hypotension and oliguria.
Her HR improved with initiation of amiodarone and esmolol gtt, and her SBP improved with better HR control.
Her proBNP was found to be elevated and exam showed peripheral edema, suggesting CHF exacerbation in the setting of recent AF with [**Last Name (LF) 5509**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was given lasix 10 mg and 40 mg while in the ICU.
While in the ICU, she also had voriconazole switched back to micafungin given transaminitis possibly [**1-13**] drug toxicity and metronidazole was discontinued [**1-13**] metallic taste in the mouth.
She was on braod spectrum antibiotics for underlying infectious etiology given her neutropenic fever.
#ALL: On arrival, the patient had a CXR that showed no intrathroacic pathology, a splenic ultrasound that showed a mildly enlarged spleen with no intrasplenic abnormalities, an ECHO that showed an EF of 55%; the patient subsequently udnerwent a procedure for central line placement.
Patient received a modified dose of daunorubicin as she had previously received anthracyclines for treatment of her breast cancer.
She received Day 1 Daunorubicin and Vincristine, and Day 8 Vincristine.
# Febrile neutropenia: Patient was placed on IV Vanco and Cefepime.
She continued to have fevers, so she was placed on IV Micafungin.
Her antibiotic coverage was broadened to include vancomycin, cefepime, voriconazole, bactrim ppx, and on [**2050-10-5**], levofloxacin and metronidazole were added.
She was given a unit of blood and pressures responded to the 100s-110s.
She was again hypotensive the following morning, and was given a fluid bolus, and she had pressures that were erratic in the 130s and 100s.
She continued to require oxygen at 3-5L via NC.
She was initially was treated with a fluid bolus of a liter for dehydration and hypotension.
She was loaded with amiodarone drip and put on an esmolol drip to control her rate and rhythm.
# Transaminitis: She completed her course of aspariginase, and subsequently her LFT's increased and were continuing to do so on transfer to the MICU on [**10-7**].
It was likely a combination of poor forward flow and medications that led to her renal failure.
She no longer wished to undergo testing, and did not want to take medications any longer aside from pain control.
We made available to her symptom control medications for nausea, pain, bowel regimen, and anxiety.
Medications on Admission: anastrozole 1 mg daily atenolol 25 mg daily   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Season  Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: ALL acute renal failure from ATN pancytopenia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were treated with chemotherapy, and your blood counts responded.
We were treating you for the multiple medical problems that you developed; however, you decided to stop treatment and to be made comfortable.
