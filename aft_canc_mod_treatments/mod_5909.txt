She also had pruritic lesions on the extensor surfaces of bilateral elbows, chest and scalp.
She was discharged on Naproxen and Levaquin with improving respiratory status and improving infiltrates on CXR.
Since admission, she underwent renal evaluation and was found to have dysmorphic red cells and muddy brown casts in her urine.
On [**10-25**] patient had increasing N/V and somnolence with asterixis, was started on HD for suspected uremia, with improving mentation after HD.
Cervical dysplasia in [**2097-8-5**] followed by cone biopsy and cryo for high-grade CIN III.

Renal and Rheumatology were consulted and patient was started on empiric pulse steroids.
A renal biopsy was done on left kidney [**10-22**] and eventually showed collapsing FSGS.
She also has b/l pulmonary infiltrates of unclear etiology, and along with polyarthritis, new onset renal failure, mild transaminitits, initial concern was vasculitis.
Beta glucan and galactamannan were negative as well.
However the repeat CT scan showed great improvement in the infiltrates with steroids and dialysis.
However, after two weeks of dialysis and steroids, repeat CT [**11-8**] did now show much difference from [**10-22**] other than decreased pleural effusions.
She underwent aggressive fluid removal for the first 2weeks, then appeared euvolemic/hypovolemic, then HD occurred MWF via a right vascath, then a tunneled catheter was placed on [**11-10**].
She was treated with NSAID and Percocet and a hematologic w/u was started.
A CXR revealed RML infiltrate c/w PNA and the Pt was Rx with Azithromycin on [**10-6**].
She was treated with steroids and HD.
Her non-productive cough, DOE, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates/opacities have persisted  despite dialysis with fluid removal.
She has had decreased O2sats on room air intermittently requiring supplemental oxygen.
# ARF/collapsing FSGS: Biopsy on [**2111-10-22**] showed collasping FSGS, and pulse steroids were started in addition to HD.
She has continued with HD on MWF.
She has been continued on prednisone 100mg QOD (D1 was [**2111-11-10**]) as well as PPx with Bactrim SS QD.
Infectious work-up was negative, and she did not worsen on high dose steroids and off antibiotics.
Today her pathology confirmed BOOP, and the Pulmonary consult team recommended continuing her on high-dose steroids.
She improved progressively on standing tylenol and with improved comfort and hydration.
Infectious w/u negative as above, not on any antibiotics except for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
Bronch and BAL findings as noted above, started on fluconazole with a plan to continue for 14 days (last dose [**2111-12-2**]).
Stable on clonazepam 0.25mg [**Hospital1 **] plus ativan 0.5mg q4 PRN.
# Elevated PTT: Only very mildly elevated off heparin with normal PT, unclear clinical significance.
Restarted heparin SQ given very high risk of DVT/PE in this Pt who was essentially bed-bound with nephrotic syndrome.
However, time correlation with HD suggested symptoms may be correlated with decreased perfusion/low flow during HD.
# Abnormal breast opacity: H/o L breast DCIS s/p lumpectomy '[**09**], then partial masectomy.
