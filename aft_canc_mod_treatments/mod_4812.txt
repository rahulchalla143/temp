Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo male with ESRD on HD, RCC and prostate cancer, h/o dementia who was transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] for evaluation and treatment of a lower GI bleed.
He was initially managed in the MICU for closer monitoring, where he required blood transfusions but remained hemodynamically stable, so he was transferred to the floor.
At that point he was evaluated by IR and underwent angiogram with coil embolization of a foci of angiodysplasia near the cecum.
After discussion with the MICU team, the patient and his family decided that he would not wish to pursue further surgical treatment.
His protonix was transitioned to po dosing, and he did not require any further blood products while on the floor.
He was started on treatment with vancomycin and completed a 7 day course.
#) ESRD on HD: Patient on M/W/F schedule with access being R. fistula, last performed on 3 days prior to admission at Fresenius ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 86685**]).
His regular renal medications were continued, but when his phosphorus became low at the time of discharge it was suggested that his calcium acetate be decreased to twice daily administration.
Once his bleed had stablized he was first restarted on labetalol prior to discharge.
We recommend that his nifedipine be restarted the day after discharge and that it be held the morning of dialysis since he has had some episodes of low blood pressure while at dialysis.
#) HYPERLIPIDEMIA/CAD: Patient's statin was initially held while in the MICU, and his aspirn and plavix were also held in the setting of his GI bleed.
His statin was restarted after  he left the MICU, and his aspirin can be restarted on [**2136-3-16**].
His plavix was not restarted due to concern about the increased risk of bleeding on dual anti-platelet therapy, and we would recommend continuing to hold his plavix given the severity of his GI bleed, this issue can be readdressed by his primary care physician after discharge.
#) GOUT: Patient's home dose of allopurinol was initially held but was restarted on hospital day 1 and then continued throughout his admission.
#) COGNITIVE DECLINE: Patient was continued on his home dose of donepizil and risperdal, attempted to maintain his day/wake cycle as best as possible to help prevent concurrent delirium while in the hospital.

You required a lot of blood transfusions, but the bleeding slowed down and you were able to be transferred out of the intensive care unit.
Also during  your stay you were found to have a positive blood culture, which we think was due to a line infection, and you were found to have a urinary tract infection.
Both of these infections were treated with antibiotics that were given at dialysis.
