Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 51 year old male with DM, HTN, metastatic rectal cancer s/p resection, XRT with recurrence presents to an OSH 20 days prior with sob, abdominal pain, nausea, emesis and was transferred here for further management.
Surgery was following patient with consideration of palliative diversion.
Initially, he had an NG tube placed.
Eventually, his bowel improved with enemas, dulcolax, colace and senna as well as methylnaltrexone.
Given that the etiology remained elusive and he was receiving opoid antagonists, the surgical team was reconsulted and the GI service was consulted.
Post-operatively, given persistent tachycardia, the patient spent 1 day in the ICU and then was transferred back to the floor.
His post-op course was complicated a hospital acquired pneumonia (for which he completed a 14-day course of vanc and zosyn) and worsening ileus, with minimal flatus and bowel movements and no po intake for several days post-operatively.
A pleurex catheter was placed by interventional pulmonology and drained intermittently throughout his stay.
During his time on the surgery service, he also underwent a paracentesis, with removal of 2.5 liters.
After transfer to the oncology service, the patient still had an NGT tube on suction in place.
He continued to have abdominal pain and nausea, which would worsen when his NGT tube was clamped.
He received adenosine with only minimal improvement in his heart rate.
He was started on a heparin drip.
He opted to continue with the second round of chemotherapy in the hope that it would give him some more quality time to spend with his family.
However, prior to this round of chemotherapy being given, the patient's clinical status worsened.
It was decided to hold the chemotherapy at that time.
During this time, the patient was also noted to have a brief episode of neutropenia and fever, for which he was placed on vanc and cefepime for 2 days.
His O2 sats decreased and he was placed on a face tent, which improved his sats.
He became severely tachypneic and tachycardic and was transferred to the ICU.
He was started on vanc and zosyn.
In the ICU, he was initially placed on BiPAP and then transitioned to non-rebreather.
He was placed on a morphine infusion.
He was maintained on an insulin sliding scale until he was made [**Date Range 3225**].
At the time of discharge, the patient still has an NG tube to suction.
He remains NPO with an ileus.
He also remains on a morphine drip.
