The shortness of [**Year (4 digits) 1440**] was not associated with chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting.
He was given asa and 1 set of CE was negative.
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, status post allo-bone marrow transplant 10 years ago at [**Hospital1 336**].
2. extensive chronic graft vs. host 3. diffuse osteopenia treated with bisphosphonate 4. cyclosporine induced renal toxicity 5. shingles - admitted in [**2197-5-11**] with IV acyclovir 6. left parietal actinic keratosis s/p nitrogen treatment 7.
[**8-27**]: Right hip XR IMPRESSION: Limited exam.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 52yo M w/ CLL s/p alloBMT in [**2188**] with chronic skin GVHD admitted for hypercarbic respiratory failure of unclear etiology with GI bleed, leukopenia.
Though he had a favorable RSBI when he was extubated on [**8-28**] he required reintubation after approx 2 hrs of extubation for increased work of breathing, likely related to mechanical muscle weakness.
He had a tracheostomy tube and PEG tube surgically placed on [**9-4**] for for more slow weaning off the vent via sprint-rest trach mask trials and was awaiting placement in a respiratory rehabilitation center, however throughout the week prior to his death, he was requiring higher vent settings and continued to desaturate.
VAP-While awaiting tracheostomy tube placement he developed increased FIO2 requirement, low-grade fever, and leukopenia with bandemia in the setting of new LLL and RUL opacity, so [**9-3**] was started on cefipime, vanco, levofloxacin for VAP.
Leukopenia-he developed leukopenia [**9-2**], with WBC count trending down during his hospital course, possibly myelosupression from medication vs infection vs myleodysplastic syndrome, differential showed bandemia suggestive of infection.
He was on cellcept for GVHD whcih was held starting [**9-4**] but he was continued on steroid taper and plaquenil and followed by BMT.
Aspirin and heparin were held as he also had bright red blood per recutm, enzymes trending down, ECG changes resolved.
He was maintained on metoprolol.
Blood per rectum-he developed BRBPR on [**8-30**] and continued to have melenotic stools, most likely lower GI source due to rapid onset, DDx includes diverticulosis, AVM, hemmroids, ulcer, gastritis, DIC labs neg.
He was maintained on pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **].
DIC labs neg, heparin dependent antibody neg, cellcept decreased per BMT rec due to potencial cause of thrombocytopenia .
HTN-He had quite labile blood pressures ranging from 80's to 200's systolic with tachycardia that were controlled ultimately with metoprolol, captopril and PRN hydralazine.
GVHD: chronic cutaneous disease, stable, continued on fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis, pentamidine for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**] (last [**2200-8-24**]), steroids, plaquenil, but cellcept held [**9-4**] for leukopenia.
