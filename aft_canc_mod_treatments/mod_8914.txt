Name:  [**Known lastname 4527**], [**Known firstname **]                Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 4528**]  Admission Date:  [**2121-7-22**]     Discharge Date:  [**2121-7-31**]  Date of Birth:   [**2045-4-18**]     Sex:  F  Service:  Addendum:  COMPLETION OF HOSPITAL COURSE: Pulmonary:  Following transfer to the floor, the patient required supplemental oxygen of 2 to 4 liters per minute to maintain saturations over 90% which is likely close to her baseline.
She has proven to be exquisitely sensitive to narcotics and high percentages of O2 with respect to her respiratory drive as both Ultram and O2 flow rates of greater than 4 liters per minute and a resultant decreased respiratory rate.
She was also continued on Flovent, Serevent, albuterol prn and Atrovent inhalers.
The INR needs to be followed closely given her low platelets and significant fall risk, but she needs to remain therapeutic from now until she returns for her cardioversion.
Her transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit was preceded by an episode of bradycardia, but followed her change from diltiazem to diltiazem ER.
Renal:  The patient has been diuresed on the floor for congestive heart failure with Lasix with improvement in her shortness of breath.
This required repeated oral potassium supplementation.
She is being discharged on a standing dose of potassium, but will require daily monitoring until her diuretic regimen is stabilized.
