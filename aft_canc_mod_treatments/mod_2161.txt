She underwent total hip replacement on [**2140-1-8**] and since that time has been at rehab.
She was started on coumadin post surgery for DVT prophylaxis.
Her rehab course was complicated by c. diff for which she is currently taking PO vancomycin.
Four days ago she had a bloodly bowel movement and anticoagulation was stopped.
She did not have any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis.

IR Procedure [**1-23**]: 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 77 y.o female with extensive pmhx including afib recently anticoagulated s/p L hip replacement on [**1-8**], chf, ckd, mpd, hemorrhoidectomy in [**6-/2139**], lower GIB in [**7-/2139**] s/p superior rectal artery embolization, now with lower GI bleeding, Cdiff infection, UTI and hip infection.
Most medications, including antibiotics, were discontinued, with only continuation of medications for comfort, including antiemetics, pain medications.
She was transferred back to the floor, and remained on comfort-based medications with apparent good effect until her passing on the evening of [**2140-2-4**].
At that time she underwent coiling of her right superior rectal artery with resolution of bleeding.
Patient underwent tagged RBC scan which identified the source of the bleeding as the sigmoid colon but no bleeding was seen on subsequent IR imaging so no interventions were performed.
She required a total of 9 units of blood during this hospital stay.
Protonix gtt was discontinued as her bleeding source was almost definitively from a lower source.
# Hip Infection: Patient underwent left-sided hip replacement on [**1-8**] at [**Hospital3 **].
The wound looked infected and was healing poorly so she was taken to the OR on [**1-24**] for wound dehiscence and two infected collections were seen, one superficial and one deep.
Vacs were applied and the prosthesis was changed.
Both were found to be growing Proteus and Enterococcus (same organisms as the urine).
Infectious disease was consulted who recommended IV ceftriaxone and IV vancomycin, which was later narrowed to ampcillin monotherapy.
During her stay on the floor, her mental status deteriorated to the point of unresponsiveness on [**2-2**], despite not having been given any sedating medications for several days.
Started on PO vancomycin on [**2140-1-19**], which was continued during her stay.
Patient was passing pseudomembranes in stool here so was started on IV flagyl on [**1-23**].
IV flagyl was d/c'ed for one day with return of her diarrhea so she was continued on double therapy through [**1-30**].
Course will be for at least two weeks after patient is off antibiotic therapy for her hip infection.
After initial bleed subsided, she was restarted on her home beta-blocker and her rates were well-controlled for some time.
on [**4-8**], her tachycardia to 140s became more persistent, and pt required frequent bolus doses of IV metoprolol to keep her HR below 130s.
She was kept off anticoagulation during her stay, given her GI bleed.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine fluctuated early in hospitalization, then later steadily trended upwards.
Her creatinine worsened with both volume resuscitation and diuresis.
# Diastolic CHF: Patient with history of diastolic CHF, previously on 120 mg of lasix daily, but has not been on lasix as per rehab records.
# Leukocytosis: Patient with known MDS and baseline WBC ranging between 10 - 20,000.
Leukocytosis was attributed to patient's many sources of infection including ongoing C.diff, UTI, and hip infection.
Her troponin was slightly elevated from baseline (0.05) but CK and CK MB remained flat and serial enzymes showed downtrending troponin.
She was continued on atorvastatin 40 mg PO and restarted her daily baby aspirin.
# COPD: Continue tiotropium bromide 18 mcg daily and Albuterol sulfate nebs Q6H PRN.
# MDS:  Continue Hydroxyurea 500 mg MWF .
