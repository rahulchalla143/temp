He was discharged on Augmentin for a further 10 day course to end [**2135-6-2**].
Blood pressures dropped to 56 systolic and he was given 2L NS and systolics came up to 70s-80, so he was placed on peripheral dopamine.
He had a central line placed for access to continue monitoring hemodynamics and for easy pressor use.
Arrived with right IJ in place and was on dopamine pressor with blood pressures stable at 118/67.
