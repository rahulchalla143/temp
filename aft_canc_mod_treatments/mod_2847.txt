On [**2108-1-1**], the patient was admitted for a matched unrelated donor allogenic bone marrow transplant.

Nasal aspirates were sent for RSV-DA.
RSV antigens came back positive and the patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for ribavirin and monoclonal immunoglobulin treatments.
Prior to his transfer to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient received polyclonal immunoglobulins in the outpatient setting.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient received five days of ribavirin 2 grams inhaled three times a day.
The patient also received monoclonal IVIG.
The patient was started on cefepime for fever and functional neutropenia.
The patient was continued on cyclosporin and prednisone, and was transfused to maintain a hematocrit of 25.

ALL:  The patient is day plus 40, status post an allogeneic matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplant.
He is currently on prednisone 40 mg q.d.
for graft versus host disease treatment for his grade 1 skin GVH.
He is also on cyclosporin continuous infusion for his GVH prophylaxis.
There was concern that the diarrhea represented graft versus host disease and the patient was started on enterocort.
Therefore, it was not thought that this represented graft versus host disease, however, the prednisone was not tapered.
RSV:  The patient completed five days of ribavirin and IVIG.
He received a total of four days of cefepime and it was then discontinued as blood cultures were negative.
He remained on prophylactic dose acyclovir and fluconazole.
He was therefore continued on total peripheral nutrition.

Ursodial 300 mg po q.d.
Cyclosporin 168 mg continuous infusion q.d.
Enterocort 3 mg, 1 po q.d.

Acute lymphocytic leukemia after matched unrelated donor allogenic bone marrow transplant.
RSV respiratory infection, status post ribavirin, synergist and palivuzinad.
