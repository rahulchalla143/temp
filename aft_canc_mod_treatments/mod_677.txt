PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, his vital signs are temperature of 96.8 F.; blood pressure 129/65; heart rate 72; respiratory rate 20; 98% on three liters on initial evaluation.
His chemistries had a sodium of 138, potassium of 4.0, chloride 104, bicarbonate of 24, BUN of 23, creatinine 1.9, glucose 91.
He was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.
He was continued on his home medications with increased Lasix for diuresis.
He had no obvious evidence for pneumonia and improved slightly with diuresis; however, given his aortic stenosis as a potential source of his increasing shortness of breath, Cardiothoracic Surgery consultation was called.
The patient had prior outpatient appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for an aortic valve replacement, however, given his recurrent worsening cardiopulmonary status, the question of moving to surgery sooner was discussed.
The Dental Service recommended an Oromaxillofacial Surgery consultation for removal of his teeth prior to any cardiovascular surgery.
The Cardiology Service felt that he would benefit from inotropic therapy and gentle diuresis.
Therefore he was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for Dobutamine therapy.
After stabilizing his shortness of breath with diuresis in the Cardiac Care Unit, the patient was transferred to the floor for preoperative management of his aortic stenosis.
The patient had been on a heparin drip for his atrial fibrillation which was held for the procedure.
After waiting 48 hours postoperatively, the heparin drip was resumed.
Shortly after he resumed heparin drip, the patient had bleeding from the extraction site which will be discussed further under the Hematology and anemia section below.
Due to difficulty controlling his bleeding, the patient's valve surgery was delayed and it was felt that he would benefit from better medical stabilization as well as improving functional status prior to surgery.
Based on this discussion, it was felt that the patient would benefit most from an aortic percutaneous transluminal valvuloplasty as a bridging procedure to assess for any improvement prior to a more invasive and potentially morbid procedure of cardiothoracic surgery and aortic valve replacement.
During and following the procedure, the patient's heparin drip was held for approximately six hours.
He was able to work with Physical Therapy and ambulate as we will discuss below.
At the time of this dictation, the patient is planned to convert from heparin to his prior warfarin therapy.
He will start his 2.5 mg of warfarin following a 24 to 48 hour window with no evidence of groin hematoma or complication of the valvuloplasty procedure.
He will also transition to low molecular weight heparin injections for outpatient adjustment to warfarin.
In addition, he will follow-up with his primary care physician as well as Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] or a member of the Cardiothoracic Surgery Group for further discussion of aortic valve replacement based on his functional status and improvement over the coming weeks to months.
He will continue on his home medications as per admission for his other cardiovascular conditions including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation.
Blood cultures were positive for group A strep and the patient was initially started on Azithromycin, Flagyl, ceftriaxone and Vancomycin for coverage of the above pathogens; however, the Group A strep culture and sensitivities returned and the patient was transitioned to penicillin and clindamycin.
He was maintained on the antibiotics for 21 days while waiting to rule out any potential endocarditis or infection prior to potential surgery.
However, after the completion of his valvuloplasty, the antibiotics were discontinued.
Other Infectious Disease issues were that the patient was initially admitted with conjunctivitis and was continued on Levofloxacin eye drops which were switched to erythromycin eye drops.
His conjunctivitis improved and eye drops were discontinued.
He was initially continued on his Coumadin for his atrial fibrillation and was switched to a heparin drip pending further procedural work-up.
This site was controlled with pressure using damp gauze as well as a holding the heparin drip.
He was transfused three units of packed red blood cells for the initial blood loss as well as an additional unit for equilibration.
He remained difficult to regulate on his heparin drip with PTTs ranging from 40 to 150 on equivalent rates of heparin.
The Oromaxillofacial Surgery Service recommended using Amicar mouthwash solution as needed for mouth bleeding.
Coumadin 2.5 mg as per his admission.
He will also switch to a short course of Lovenox to transition to the oral warfarin.
He had responses with confusion and agitation secondary to receiving sedating medications including Ambien and other benzodiazepines as well as opiate narcotics.
Given this, these medications were minimized as possible.
He was continued on his Allopurinol per his home regimen.
Based on his flare and attempts to improve his pain while ambulating, the patient was started on colchicine.
Based on his mild renal failure, he was not felt to be a candidate for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
At the time of this dictation, his gout remains tolerable, but it is recommended that he continue with oral hydration and may need further treatment for his gout flare if it continues in the future.
DISPOSITION:   The patient was followed actively by Physical Therapy during his stay in the hospital.
They felt that he would benefit from continued Physical Therapy to assist with strength and rehabilitation following his prolonged hospitalization.
