On [**4-24**], she underwent a laser resection of her lung mass in a palliative attempt to open up her RLL, RML and RUL.
The IP MD put his mouth on the ETT and blew out the fire, though it lasted [**6-28**] secs in his opinion.
Subsequent to that, she developed a large R pleural effusion, underwent CT-guided drainage with pigtail cath placement, which itself was complicated by a tension PTX, leading to eventual chest tube placement.
She was later felt to have a L PTX from barotrauma, and underwent a L chest tube placement.
A tracheostomy was performed.
She then underwent [**2-23**] treatments to this area with external beam XRT.
However, the patient's previously estranged daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 27273**] was [**Name (NI) 653**], and she stated that she wanted the patient to continue to receive maximal care except for electric shocks and CPR.

#Hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure:  This was felt to be due to combination of lung injury from smoke inhalation with capillary leak, bilateral pneumonia, volume overload and airway disease secondary to lobar collapse with lung cancer.
She underwent rigid bronchoscopy in the OR [**2160-6-4**] with debridement of eschar, removal of RMS stent in pieces and replacement of tracheostomy.
She required pressure control ventilation with maximum pressure and oxygenation support.
She was treated with vancomycin, cefepime for pneumonia.
This was changed to vancomycin and meropenem on day three.
She continued ot be difficult to oxygenate, and required sedation and paralysis to maintain respiratory support.
She underwent two further bronchoscopies [**2160-6-7**].
Blood pressure was supported with normal saline iv fluid boluses and levophed.
#Sedation:  Patient was transfered from OSH intubated, sedated, paralyzed; on Fentanyl drip, 300mcg/hr; Versed drip, 22mg/hr; Nimbex drip, 4.2mcg/kg/min.
Nibmex was changed to vecuronium as nibmex was maxed and she was still responding.
She  was weaned off vecuronium twice, but both times responded with hypoxemia, PaO2 50s.
When the decision was made to withdraw ventilatory support, the vecuronium was discontintued five hours prior to ventilatory weaning.
She was treated initially with cefepime and vancomycin.
Cefepime was switched to meropenem to broaden gram-negative coverage.
She was continued on Digoxin 0.125 qday, and amiodarone was change to po dosing.
#DM: patient was kept on insulin gtt for tight glucose control.
#Buttocks: Decubitus ulcer was treated with accuzyme and dressed daily .
#Code status:  the patient expired [**2160-6-8**] after family meeting was held and decision made to withdraw care with focus on comfort measures.
