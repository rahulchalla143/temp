New, extensive, heterogeneous opacification is seen predominately in the right lung, with peripheral consolidation and lesser degree of central opacification.
Right- sided volume loss suggests a chronic process.
IMPRESSION: Compared to [**2124**] study, new extensive heterogeneous opacification in the right lung with peripheral consolidation and lesser degree of central opacification.
Differential is broad, including pneumonia, postinfectious and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, multifocal bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, Churg- [**Doctor Last Name 3532**] vasculitis, amiodarone toxicity.
Right central catheter tip is in the mid SVC.
NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior septum, anterior wall and apex.
He had a [**Hospital 5610**] hospital course and was intubated with persistant hypoxic resp failure.
Etiology was unclear with concern for eosinophilic pneumonia, HAP, pulm edema.
Due to progressive decline and poor prognosis, family decided to make him comfort measures only and patient passed away on [**2132-4-2**] 17:10.
#Hypoxic Resp Failure: Over his [**Hospital 5610**] hospital course, he had continued decline of respiratory status of unclear etiology.
Initial bronchoscopy revealed high eosinophilia and he was felt to have eosinophilic pneumonia and treated with a course of steroids although he did not have a dramatic improvement in his resp status.
He was treated with broad coverage antibiotics with no improvement in resp status and further worsening of disease.
VAP pneumonia - s/p bronch, infectious studies with no obvious source.
Beta-glucan and galactomannan negative; mycolytic blood culture negative.
Heparin gtt was started.
Thought possibly from hormone therapy for prostate CA.
# h/o prostate cancer: receiving hormonal therapy q3 months but patient reports his treatment was skipped this month due to his symptoms.
