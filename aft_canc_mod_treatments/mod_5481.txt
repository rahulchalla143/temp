Right subclavian central venous line placed on [**2117-2-2**]; removed on [**2117-2-18**].
[**2117-2-2**] Removal of Hickman catheter .
[**2117-2-12**] Bronchoscopy and thoracocentesis   History of Present Illness: A 48-year-old gentleman with a history of AML-M5B status post matched unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplant with Cytoxan/TBI conditioning on [**2116-8-25**] presenting with facial swelling.
He was seen in clinic 4days prior and was started on Azithromycin.
Of note, he had his tunnelled catheter removed from his L IVC on [**1-20**] and had one placed on the right.
[**Name2 (NI) 17911**] clot was seen, and he was started on TPA gtt.
Sent to ICU for TPA/heparin treatment overnight.
He underwent 7 and 3 induction chemotherapy and achieved a complete remission, although his course was complicated by diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage.
He also received a dose of intrathecal ARA-C.
He developed hepatic candidiasis which was treated successfully with oral Diflucan, which delayed his allogeneic stem cell transplant, but then he underwent matched unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplant with Cytoxan and TBI conditioning on [**2116-8-25**].
He had no other infectious etiology found and he was begun on a prednisone for presumed idiopathic BOOP and this has been tapered slowly over time.
CT scan showed new right upper lobe hazy infiltrate and nasal aspirate was positive for RSV.
He was given a dose of palivizumab and was treated with a course of levofloxacin.

********* RADIOLOGY ********* Admission CXR [**2116-2-1**]: A right-sided subclavian catheter is detected with tip in the proximal-to-mid [**Month/Day/Year 17911**].
A 36-hour followup TPA infusion [**Date Range 17911**] venogram was obtained with injection of contrast through the indwelling 5 French vascular sheath, which demonstrated further partial interval clearance of thrombosis in upper [**Date Range 17911**], and a tight severe focal mid-[**Date Range 17911**] stenosis.
The patient's right neck including indwelling vascular sheath was prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.
Balloon dilatation was performed at segment of [**Date Range 17911**] stenosis with 12 mm x 4 cm and 14 mm x 4 cm balloon catheters.
Followup venogram after balloon dilatation demonstrated much interval improvement of [**Date Range 17911**] stenosis and disappearance of collateral veins and small residual thrombus in upper [**Date Range 17911**].
Tunneled part of previous right IJ Hickman catheter was removed uneventfully.
****IMPRESSION: Significant improvement in [**Date Range 17911**] stenosis and thrombosis s/p TPA infusion and [**Name (NI) 17911**] PTA.
****RECOMMENDATION:  Full anticoagulation with IV heparin and warfarin for 3-6 months.
********* PATHOLOGY ********* [**2117-2-12**] BAL- Negative for malignant cells.Reactive bronchial cells and abundant pulmonary macrophages.
Reactive mesothelial cells and inflammatory cells.
T cells comprise ~90% of lymphoid gated events and express mature lineage antigens (CD2, 3, 5, and 7).
Brief Hospital Course: # [**Year/Month/Day 17911**] syndrome: The patient had a history of AML and presented five months following his matched unrelated allogeneic transplant with evidence of [**Year/Month/Day 17911**] syndrome (an edematous face and bilateral upper extremities).
On the day of admission, [**2117-1-31**], he underwent IR-guided [**Month/Day/Year 17911**] clot thrombolysis and venous ballon stenting.
The [**Month/Day/Year 17911**] clot likely formed in the context of a foreign body (portocath) in [**Month/Day/Year 17911**].
(Of note, the patient had this portocath was placed on [**2117-1-20**], approximately 1.5 weeks prior to presentation).
The right subclavian Hickmann portocath was removed subsequently on [**2117-2-2**].
He was then started on the heparin drip.
He was continued on the heparin drip until discharge.
Coumadin was begun after the final procedure (bronchoscopy/thoracocentesis).
He was discharged on a lovenox bridge to coumadin.
He will require longterm anticoagulation for 3-6 months for [**Name (NI) 17911**] syndrome.
For a HCT 25, he was tranfused 1 unit pRBCs, and tachycardia improved 120s-->100.
The patient was transferred from the [**Month/Year (2) 3242**] service to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] ([**Hospital1 1516**]) for closer monitoring and to allow for closer proximity to cath lab/CCU in case of the need for urgent pericardiocentesis.
He was tachycardic with a rate in the 120s, with a 500cc bolus of NS and continual rate of 100cc/hr of NS his rate responded and slowed slightly to 100-110.
Vascular surgery was involved; the pericardial effusion was too small to intervene, i.e.
drain or place a pericardial window.
# ?Pulmonary infection The patient was started on levofloxacin on [**2-4**] due to the question of an infiltrate on chest radiograph to cover for a community acquired pneumonia.
On [**2117-2-7**] the patient spiked to 100.3 and given bilateral apical infiltrates on CT chest, he was started on vancomycin in addition to levofloxacin.
He completed a course of levofloxacin on [**2117-2-13**] for pneumonia.
Vancomycin was discontinued on [**2-16**].
Vancomycin was discontinued on [**2-16**].
It is recommended that the creatinine should be monitored closely as an outpatient.
# Status post [**Month (only) 3242**] Continued atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis and Voriconazole for [**Month (only) 1065**] coverage along with acyclovir for zoster prophylaxis.
Continued Prednisone for BOOP.
He will remained on his current dose of Neoral at 50 mg twice per day.

You were found to have a clot in the superior vena cava, the vessel which drains venous blood from your upper extremities and head to your heart.
The clot was subsequently lyzed with TPA (tissue plasminogen activator) and also a procedure was performed to open the vessel (balloon angioplasty).
You were then placed on anticoagulation with a heparin drip.
Before discharge, your anticoagulation regimen was switched to oral coumadin.
You were also prescribed lovenox injections twice daily to be continued while you bridge to therapeutic coumadin levels.
Your outpatient oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 877**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] advise you when to stop lovenox and to be on coumadin only.
You will likely need 6 months of anticoagulation with coumadin due to your pulmonary embolism.
You completed a 2 week course of antibiotics for this infection.
* Please resume home medications except for amlodipine.
You blood pressure will be rechecked in clinic tomorrow morning, and amlodipine will likely need to be restarted as an outpatient.
Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous injection twice daily for 7 days or as for a period of time as otherwise directed by your outpatient physician.
Warfarin 5 mg by mouth every evening for 6 months total time period of anticoagulation.
Magnesium oxide 400 mg by mouth daily .
Please followup at the [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] 7/outpatient clinic 9:00 AM on [**2117-2-19**] for blood draw to check your renal function, electrolytes, coagulation panel, and cyclosporin level.
