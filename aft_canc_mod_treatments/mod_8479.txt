Admission Date:  [**2166-3-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-3-29**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Nasogastric tube placed and removed x2 PEG tube placed in interventional radiology [**2166-3-28**]  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 8072**] is a 86 year-old man with a history of HTN and renal mass with hilar adenopathy concerning for RCC who was admitted on [**3-19**] and is now being transferred to the MICU for further care.
Initially presented to an OSH with worsening dyspnea x [**3-12**] days--he has had dyspnea for several months with ongoing malignancy workup involving the lungs and has been on oxygen for several weeks.
Thoracics saw the patient, and found no contraindication to anticoagulation, therefore a heparin gtt was started.
Renal mass with mediastinal LAD suspicious for RCC - s/p 2 non-diagnostic EBUS-TBNA complicated by ?
PEG tube in place with dressing c/d/i Ext- no pedal edema.
CXR [**3-18**]: IMPRESSION: Multifocal airspace opacity superimposed on a background of chronic interstitial lung disease, with recurrent pleural effusions.
[**2166-3-25**] Video swallow eval: Moderate-to-severe pharyngeal dysphagia secondary to weakness with a right unilateral component, as well as reduced laryngeal elevation, valve closure and epiglottic deflection and decreased bolus propulsion, resulting in persistent penetration and frequent aspiration with all consistencies.
SOB: Medical ICU Course: The patient was transferred to the Medical ICU after developing hypoxia during a blood transfusion on the floor.
He was given 60mg of IV lasix with some improvement, but he still required a non-rebreather and thus transfer was initiated.
His acute hypoxia partly coincides with receiving IVF for possible cardiac catheterization and blood transfusion on the morning of transfer.
The patient was given multiple boluses of 60-80mg IV lasix, with diuresis of 500cc->1L with each bolus.
He required CPAP for his first overnight stay, and was then transitioned to high-flow face mask.
Given initial concern for PE, CT angiogram and LENIs were considered, however given patient's renal insufficiency, it was decided that he should not receive IV contrast.
Despite successful diuresis, the patient continued to require high-flow facemask O2, and thus Chest CT was obtained.
The patient got acutely better after starting SoluMedrol, to the point of only requiring his baseline O2 supplementation of 4L via NC on transfer to the Medicine floor.
On the medical floor, the pt continued to improve at times on room air and at others on shovel mask for humidification at advice of ENT.
He finished a 5 day course of solumedrol and levofloxacin.
He was continued on nebs with good effect.
Patient was treated with ASA, plavix and heparin drip overnight on transfer.
Per cardiology consult, suspicion for NSTEMI was low as hypokinesis was global, not regional, and plavix/heparin drip were discontinued.
Pt has had several procedures to attempt biopsy with thoracic surgery including bronchoscopy without ability to characterize pathologically.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from thoracic surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] in house and felt nothing further to do at this time.
Due to this, PEG tube was placed [**3-28**] and initially used on [**3-29**] with no problems.
Tube feeds are being ramped up to goal at time of discharge.
He will need consistent PT and speech therapy at rehab.
[**Name (NI) 30294**] Pt has BPH with new use of tamsulosin as outpt prior to admission.
On [**3-28**], tamsulosin was restarted and foley was removed.
However, pt was unable to urinate, had residual of 600cc and foley was reinserted.
Pt is being transferred with foley in place.
Hopefully, this can be removed as tamsulosin therapy is continued at rehab.
