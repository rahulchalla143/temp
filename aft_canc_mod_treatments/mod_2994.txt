Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 52354**] is a 65 year old woman with recurrent lung CA s/p multiple lobectomies (LLL, lingula, RUL, R superior seg) admitted to the MICU with respiratory distress 5 days s/p Y-stent placement.
Given high suspicion for upper airway process, bronchoscopy and direct vocal cord visualization was performed, which demonstrated infraglottic edema/ulceration.
The patient was treated with IV dexamethasone TID, nebulizers, racemic epinephrine, and heliox.
After 5 days of dexamethasone 10mg TID, steroids were tapered over two days.
The patient sometimes required albuterol nebulizers and O2 by NC while on the medicine service.
PT evaluated and recommended outpatient pulmonary rehab, which was arranged for after discharge.
She was walking and sleeping comfortably without supplemental oxygen on the day of discharge.
The patient had evidence of intermittent airway closure with respiration seen during bronchoscopy and was started on bi-pap at night.
Continuing bi-pap was recommended by interventional pulmonology due to closure seen during bronchoscopy; however, the patient would not tolerate bi-pap while sleeping and it was discontinued.
A course of 8 days Vancomycin IV was completed prior to discharge and leukocytosis resolved.
On discharge, the patient was started on a 6 day course of bactrim to continue treating positive MRSA cultures per thoracic surgery recommendations.
# History of pulmonary embolism The patient is on home warfarin for history of PE.
She was transitioned to lovenox prior to bronchoscopy.
Lovenox was held for the bronchoscopies and restarted following the procedures.
She was bridged to warfarin for DVT prophylaxis after transfer to the medicine service.
She was instructed to have her PT/INR checked the day after discharge and to continue SQ lovenox until instructed that INR was therapeutic by primary care clinic.
# Anemia/thrombocytopenia The patient developed both anemia and thrombocytopenia after ICU admission.
# Tongue swelling/throat itching Patient reported symptoms possibly associated with restarted warfarin dose, though she had taken warfarin chronically prior to admission.
# GERD The patient was treated with IV PPI for GERD and switched to PO PPI prior to discharge.
She sometimes required additional PRN maalox for GERD.
