The patient started on octreotide 20mg IM qmonth in [**10/2148**] and increased to 30mg on [**2149-2-26**] due to lack of response.

In the mid to terminal ileum, there were two areas of carcinomatous involvement of the small intestine extending into the bowel from the mesentery.
Multinucleated giant cells as well as benign appearing epithelial cells and macrophages were present.
