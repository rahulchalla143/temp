Admission Date:  [**2127-12-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-12-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-12-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Latex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Radiation Ablation Intubated Chest tubes x3 PICC line A-line Central line placement Tracheostomy PEG tube placement  History of Present Illness: Pt had a radio-frequency tumor ablation of left lung for new LLL small cell lung cancer, as he was an extremely poor surgical risk.
A small PTX was noted in the left lung after the procedure and a pigtail catheter was placed.
A RUL collapse was also noted thought to be secondary to mucus plugging or aspiration.
The Pt dropped his pressure soon after the procedure and was given 1L of LR and placed on norepinephrine.
Upon arrival the patient was noted to still be intubated and ventilated from the procedure with a RR=14 and Vt=700.
However, his BP continued to drop despite maximal dose of norepinephrine and continual IVF.
Given bedside TEE findings that showed a decreased CO and a mixed venous O2 in the high 50s, a cardiogenic component to his shock was entertained and dobutamine was added.
This resulted in transient increase in BP, but it then dropped markedly to SBPs=40s and epinephrine 1 mg had to be pushed and an epinephrine gtt was started.
The Pts BP responded well to the epinephrine, but continual epinephrine boluses had to be administered to maintain MAPs = 60s.
Thus vasopressin was added.
A follow-up Hct was 23, thus 2 units of PRBCs were given and Hct bumped to 29.
Upon being transferred to the MICU the Pt had been given 10.5 L of LR and was on norepinephrine, epinephrine, dobutamine and vasopressin.
After coming to the MICU the Pt was able to be weaned off norepinephrine and dobutamine, maintaining his MAP=70s.
Two additional chest tubes were placed that drained 1.5L of blood out of the left pleural space.

Small left pneumothorax managed with chest tube.
Large left hemopneumothorax with three left-sided chest tubes in place.
Abnormal orientation and position of the tracheostomy tube as discussed above, with focal collection of air outside the tracheal lumen around the tube.
Tip of a left PIC catheter projects over the SVC.
Right ventricular transvenous pacer lead projects over the floor of the right ventricle.
The PICC line is identified in good position.
Respitory Status:  Patient developed a small right pneumothorax and large left hemothorax after IR radio-ablation procedure for a NSCLC mass in the left lower lobe.
Because of the hemothorax he had 3 chest tubes placed on the left side by thoracic surgery.
These drained well after placement and were removed as the output decreased.
He had been intubated during the procedure and remained so on transfer to the MICU.
On hospital day 3 his sputum grew out MRSA and he was treated with vancomycin for a 7 day course.
His respiratory status on the vent waxed and waned and after fluid resuscitation for hypotension was noted to have significant pulmonary edema.
He required diuresis later in hospital stay which help to improve his respiratory status.
He was started on meropenem with plans for 15 day course.
He had a trach and PEG tube placed on [**12-16**].
After his trach procedure it was noted that the trach was abutted against the posterior wall.
A bronch was performed the day after trach and was noted to collapse when patient was placed on 0/0 vent support.
His fever did not change with antibiotic therapy.
All catheter tip cultures were also negative.
