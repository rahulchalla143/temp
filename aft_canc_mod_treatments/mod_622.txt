Also, lab draws will be limited to daily, even in setting of transfusion for decreased Hematocrit.
Also, after lengthy discussion about risks and benefits of taking anti-coagulation (given mechanical mitral valve), patient and family have decided to stop anticoagulation.
We are currently continuing to offer transfusions as well as antibiotics as below.
GI was consulted, but no intervention was done.
[**11-29**] with concern for thrombocytopenia, the octreotide was stopped despite continued slow bleeding.
Patient had one more episode of a 5-point hematocrit drop to 21, which bumped up to 32 after two units of packed red cells.
Thrombocytopenia has been stable in the 50-70s range and may be secondary to medications (?meropenem).
Heparin products were stopped and a HIT antibody sent, which was negative.
Octreotide was stopped [**11-29**] as there have been case reports of octreotide-associated thrombocytopenia.
Treated with imipenem and bactrim as outpatient for two weeks based on suspicion of possible dissminated Nocardia.
With plan to just do Bactrim for additional extended course per ID recommendations.
Given transfusions and hemodynamically stable, patient has been restarted on bumex @ home dose 5mg daily.
# Mechanical MVR Valve: Anticoagulation held indefinitely after lengthy discussion with patient and HCP, as noted above, despite risks of annual stroke given mechanical mitral valve.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM: continued home levothyroxine .
# HYPERTENSION: restarted bumex, holding metolazone for now.
Transitional Issues: -Please evaluate need for rectal tube and foley daily and remove asap -Please check CBC every day for 3 days and then every other day or as determined by physician at acute care facility.
