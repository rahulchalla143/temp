Pt had a spontaneous throat clear in response to penetration which was moderately effective for clearing the airway, more so with nectar-thick liquids than with thin liquids.
PO meds crushed with applesauce.
1:1 supervision to maintain strict aspiration precautions 4.
Agree with keeping NG tube in place until pt demonstrates sufficient PO intake.
His hospital course has included: - posterior lumbar fusions on [**2106-6-21**] - Anterior lumbar fusion [**2106-7-20**] - ileus and gastric outlet obstruction, requiring dilation - acalculous cholecystitis and infectious pericholecystic fluid - C difficile diarrhea - right sided exudative pleural effusion s/p chest tube and removal - health care associate pneumonia (treated with vanc/cefe/flagyl) - sacral decubitus ulcer On discharge, his condition has significantly improved.
His active problem list now includes: - multiple myeloma: untreated, will likely start chemo soon - nutrition: tolerating pureed and nectar diet, advance as tolerated - duodenal stricture: tolerating diet, GI will followup if having difficulty with PO - afib: in NSR during hospitalization, holding warfarin given comorbidities - sacral decub: needs wound care - physical therapy .
He was found to have a pathologic L4 fracture in need of stabilization and his multiple myeloma was diagnosed via tissue pathology from posterior spine stabilization on [**2106-6-21**].
Heme/Onc and Rad/Onc were aware of patient but put further treatment or evaluation for multiple myeloma on hold until more acute hospital issues are resolved (see below).
Given his improved medical status, he was transferred to rehab with followup by the oncology there to consider therapy with decadron and velcade.
Pt underwent L3-L4 bilateral hemilaminectomy with posterolateral fusion of L3-L5 with iliac crest bone graft harvest for fursion augmentation.
Due to extent of metastatic destruction, also needed second surgery for anterior spine stabilization.
Possible that the 2nd two events were due to total bowel distension and ileus [**2-24**] to narcotics, Cdiff, immobility, and limited diet as much as a problem with the duodenal stricture as they were not completely relieved with NGT placement and abdominal imaging showed persistently dilated bowel loops.
After his anterior fusion, abdomen remained distended possibly from gastric obstruction/post-operative ileus/narcotic use.
On POD4 he had 2BMs and he was started on clears for diet.
He was started on TPN in the MICU, and then transitioned to tube feeds.
He was transferred back to the floor and TPN was discontinued.
He continued on continuous tube feeds until his mental status was improved, and then underwent another video swallow eval.
He tolerated this well without further abdominal distention, and the NG tube and tube feeds were discontinued.
#) Cdiff Infection: Pt started developing leukocytosis with low grade temps on [**2106-6-29**].
Initially WBC and exam improved with this therapy but when WBC worsened again PO vanco was added to metronidazole on [**2106-7-5**].
Bowel distension slowly improved with this treatment and abdominal pain slowly resolved.
Since pt was started on Cefepime/Vanco for HAP coverage when transfered to the ICU initially and completed a 8 day course of this therapy, decision was made to extend PO Vanco/IV metronidazole coverage to end [**7-27**].
Pt was doing okay on 2-3L NC but fluid was not responding well to lasix when on the evening of [**7-5**] he became acutely tachypnic and was transfered to the ICU where he was briefly on BIPAP and CT surgery placed a chest tube with >1L of output.
Abx were broadened to cefepime and vancomycin at time of unit transfer.
Chest tube removed today and pt doing well enough to call out to floor on [**7-7**].
After arrival to the floor, stayed comfortable on RA-2L NC with only minimal reaccumulation of R pleural effusion noted on f/u CXRs.
Completed 8 day course of Cefepime/IV Vancomycin as noted above for presumed hospital acquired pneumonia and WBC which had spiked up on day of hospital transfer trended down to the normal range with these treatments.
Pt returned to the OR on [**7-20**] and remained intubated post-op.
Started therapeutic heparin to treat presumptive PE on [**7-28**]; He was not fluid overloaded and did not improve w/ lasix.
Given aspiration risk, pleural effusion and previous HCAP, restarted IV vancomycin and cefipime on [**7-29**] for 1 week.
This showed evidence of acute cholecystitis with caveat that some question if could be falsely positive in setting of NPO status.
Due to concerns for risk of perc cholecystostomy tube recommended by surgical service, decision was made to initially treat with IV abx and pt had some improvement.
However, pt improved again with drainage of pleural effusion and empiric treatment for hospital acquired pneumonia and GI consulting service agreed that less likely pt had cholecystitis in current setting although pt continued to remain at very high risk for acalculous cholecystitis due to his overall level of poor health.
#) Delirium: Pt was intermittently delirious for 4-5 days after initial ortho/spine surgery.
In the MICU patient had visual hallucinations and required restraints because started pulling at lines.
Pt had history of bleeding hemorrhoids and was on  [**Hospital1 **] omeprazole for GERD/GI prophylaxis considering his level of sickness.
Anoscopy performed by GI.
Sigmoidoscopy was performed on [**7-16**] which suggested bleeding was likely an internal hemmorhoid.
He was converted to pantoprazole 40 [**Hospital1 **] PO at discharge.
This was stopped on admission due to need for spinal surgery and relatively low day to day risk of embolic stroke compared to high risk of spinal bleeding on therapeutic anticoagulation.
Warfarin was held on discharge given multiple comorbidities and relatively low embolic risk.
His metoprolol was not re-started during the hospitalization but should be restarted at rehab and was included in his medication list.
# Nutrition Status: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was intermittently on TPN, tube feeds, and diets throughout his hospitalization.
Most recently he was transitioned from TPN to tube feeds.
His tube feeds were stopped and his NG tube was removed prior to discharge.
He was started on steroids with relief of his hypotension.
On [**8-11**] he underwent a cortisol stim test, and his cortisol level at 1hr and 15min was 17.8.
It was felt that this was nearly a normal response and that his steroids could be tapered.
He received 10mg hydrocortisone in the hospital prior to discharge, and then will receive 5mg hydrocortisone at rehab and then will stop.
