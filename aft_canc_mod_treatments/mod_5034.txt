Admission Date:  [**2140-6-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2140-7-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2078-7-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10293**] Chief Complaint: Hepatic Encephalopathy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Colonoscopy Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Serial Paracenteses Thoracocentesis   History of Present Illness: 61 yo M w/ hx etOH cirrhosis [**2-4**] EtOh, anemia, and hepato-renal syndrome presented to OSH for routine paracentesis and was found to have hyperkalemia.
On presentation to OSH on [**6-13**], he complained of abdominal pain, distension, SOB, anorexia, generalized weakness.
At OSH, treated wtih kayexelate and potassium followed.
Lasix given for diuresis and nephrology consulted.
Continued on cipro for SBP prophylaxis.
Patient was tranfused PRBCs for anemia.
He was maintained on a low protein<45g/day diet.
Tumor Markers: CA19-9: 37, CEA 5.7, PSA 0.4   Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo m with etoh cirrhosis on regular paracentesis at baseline, presented to OSH with presumed worsened Cr (unknown baseline), hyperkalemia and worsening mental status.
His acute presentation slowly resolved with octreotide/midodrine/albumin, lactulose/rifaximin, and antibiotics, respectively.
In addition, he continued to have elevated blood sugars requiring insulin therapy.
He was evaluated in collaboration between the hepatology team and the transplant surgery to determine his candidacy for transplant.
He was started on lactulose, and rifaximin and observed in the MICU.
His confusional state cleared after several days of aggressive lactulose/rifaximin and antibiotics for the sbp.
By discharge he was conversant with content appropriate to questioning, attentive to interview and exams, and following directions appropriately to check blood sugars and administer insulin injections.
The patient had been taking levofloxacin as sbp prophylaxis at home so the <250 PMN count was still thought to represent sbp and thus merit treatment - initially with vancomycin/zosyn.
The peritoneal fluid was later cultured revealing viridans streptococci which was sensitive to penicillins (and therefore cephalosporins) and the patient was switched to ceftriaxone on which he completed a 7 day course.
The last paracentesis performed during this hospitalization revealed:.....
Following the therapeutic course of ceftriaxone, the patient will be maintained on Bactrim SS prophylaxis as the prior microbe was resistant to quinolones.
# Bacteremia:  Blood cultures drawn on admission also grew viridans streptococci.
He did have a RIJ central venous catheter in place and the time the bacteremia was detected.
Although the line was not thought to be the culprit source for the infection, the line was pulled when adequate access was obtained.
He was treated with Kayexalate, fluid and diuresis.
However, his creatinine showed some lability and concern persisted for the need for combined liver-kidney transplant.
# End-stage liver Disease: The patient was evaluated in collaboration by the hepatology, nephrology, and transplant surgery teams.
The pre-transplant evaluation revealed no contra-indications to transplant, and the patient was placed on the transplant list.
His blood sugar control improved with a twice daily dosing regimen of NPH with a sliding scale for coverage.
He will continue to monitor his blood sugars and administer insulin at home with assistance of VNA and family members.
[**Name (NI) **] received extensive teaching with nursing regarding insulin administration and blood glucose measurements.
His anemia was largely attributed to his hypersplenism and underlying liver disease.
He required 6 platelet transfusions to support him while he underwent various invasive procedures.
There were no precipitous declines in the platelet count to suggest HIT, but heparin products were limited in their use nonetheless.
No infectious nidus to be indentified, however two teeth were noted to be diseased and meriting removal (Teeth #5 and #13 both upper bicuspids).
The patient was referred to the outpatient oral surgery department at [**Hospital1 2025**] for these teeth to be extracted while awaiting a liver to become available.

You were started on insulin while in the hospital.
This will require you to take fingerstick glucose measurements and then adjust your insulin requirements according to the following schedule: .
Wake up: 1) Check blood sugar, 2) give insulin - 10 units of NPH and regular insulin according to both the sliding scale and measured blood glucose, 3) eat 30 minutes after insulin.
30 min before lunch: 1) check blood sugar, 2) give regular insulin according to sliding scale and blood glucose measurement, 3) eat 30 minutes after insulin.
30 minutes before dinner: 1) check blood sugar, 2) give regular insulin according to both the sliding scale and blood glucose measurement, 3) eat 30 minutes after insulin.
Bedtime: 1) check blood sugar, 2) give 8 units of NPH and regular insulin depending on sliding scale and blood glucose measurement.
