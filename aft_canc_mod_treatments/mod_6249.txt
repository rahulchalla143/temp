Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 year old male with h/o HTN and asthma who was admitted to the MICU for stridor due to a large mass compressing his airway which required a tracheal stent placement.
Stridor due to tracheal mass: His breathing significantly improved after tracheal stent placement by IP on admission.
Repeat biopsies of mass were taken at that time and another flex bronch on [**6-25**] revealed no migration of his stent and no further intervention was performed.
He will likely get radiation to his mass as an outpatient, but there was no indication for emergent XRT as an inpatient per the rad/onc consult obtained.
He was written for Mucomyst nebs q6h and Duonebs q6h but the patient often refused them.
An outpatient steroid taper with prednisolone prescribed for asthma was continued and completed on [**6-25**].
He did have a leukocytosis but it improved without antibiotic treatment.
HTN: Continued on his home HCTZ and lisinopril with holding parameters.
Asthma: Continued albuterol/ipratropium nebs as above.
He had been on a prednisolone taper at home since [**6-2**] for a possible asthma exacerbation which was continued and ended on [**6-25**].

You had a procedure where a stent was placed in your airway to help keep it open.
You then had two more similar procedures to look into your breathing tube to make sure the stent was in place and also to get biopsies of the mass that was found in your breathing tube.
You also had another procedure called an EGD which showed that the tumor was also present in your eating tube.
The following changes have been made to your home medication regimen: - You have been started on several medications to help your breathing including Mucomyst, ipratropium nebs, Combivent inhaler - Your pain will be controlled with oxycodone extended release 20mg tablets twice daily and oxycodone liquid 10mg every 3 hours as needed for pain - You should be on a bowel regimen with Senna and Colace because the pain medication will make you constipated  Followup Instructions: You have the following appointments scheduled in follow-up: .
