While in the PACU, patient was noted to be visibly anxious and was given ativan for his h/o panic attacks.
Though no cardiac rhythm or oxygen saturation could be obtained as his leads had been removed for transport, the patient was resuscitated with ambu bag and returned to consciousness without any focal neurological deficits within one minute.
The patient had one additional panic attack that resolved with ativan administration.
Pain service was contact[**Name (NI) **] and they removed the epidural while recommending percocet PO for pain control.
The patient was found in the morning of POD2 to be in mild distress from poor pain control and was administered 1mg of dilaudid IV with good relief.
Acute pain service was consulted and they recommended a change from percocet to oxycodone PO for pain control, in addition to the scheduled toradol instituted by GU team.
The patient was also started on ditropan for continued bladder spasms and placed on a regular diet with good tolerance.
Overnight on POD2, the patient had continued lower abdominal pain, but on interview in the morning of POD3 was comfortable, and the patient had his JP drain removed, with additional abdominal pain relief.
Due to poor oral liquid intake, and signs of dehydration, the patient was placed on IVF hydration overnight.
Anesthesia did not have further recommendations and recommended an ENT consult.
He was maintained medically with previous management.
ENT saw the patient on POD5 and felt that a dose of dexamethasone and initiation of IV clindamycin would improve the patient's glottitis, which made speaking difficult and PO intake poor.
He was restarted on IV fluids and noted improvement in odynophagia and hoarseness on POD6.
