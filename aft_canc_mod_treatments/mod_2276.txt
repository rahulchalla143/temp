The patient was an otherwise healthy, retired 64-year-old gentleman without significant past medical history who presented for elective bronchoscopy [**2105-8-11**] for investigation of a right upper lobe lung mass.
He was intubated at the time.
He was given epinephrine intravenously with return of a narrow complex rhythm pulse with intermittent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
Subsequently, he was given lidocaine and shocked 200 joules and given 150 mg of amiodarone.
Subsequent to that, he was taken to the Medical Intensive Care Unit intubated and sedated on propofol drip with transient hypertension responding to intravenous fluids.
Diverticulitis, status post partial colectomy 2.
Appendectomy  OUTPATIENT MEDICINES: 1.
Gemfibrozil 600 mg po bid 2.
Aspirin 81 mg po q day  ALLERGIES:  There are no known drug allergies.
He was ventilated on assist control with tidal volume of 600 at a rate of 16, PEEP of 5, FIO2 of 1.0 with oxygen saturation of 100%.
GENERAL:  He was intubated and sedated, responds to verbal stimuli.
Post intubation chest x-ray showed right upper lobe mass, diffuse alveolar opacification on the right lungs with good position of endotracheal tube.
On hospital day 2, he subsequently developed fevers and leukocytosis, was empirically covered for aspiration pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia broadly with levofloxacin and clindamycin.
Generally, oxygenation and ventilator were stable throughout his hospital course.
Initially required high levels of PEEP up to 10 to maintain oxygenation, however relatively rapidly improved in terms of his requirements.
He completed a 14 day course of empiric therapy for aspiration pneumonia with levofloxacin and clindamycin.
Respiratory cultures were drawn on several locations.
On [**2105-8-14**], he grew sparse gram negative rods and sparse yeast in a respiratory culture and had 2+ gram positive cocci in pairs on induced sputum.
Given continued low grade temperatures, vancomycin was added on [**2105-8-18**] for broader antibiotic coverage.
Given his slow wean from the ventilator, discussions were held with the family regarding utility of tracheostomy and the patient's wishes regarding reintubation should he fail extubation.
He still required aggressive suctioning and was intermittently quite agitated with suctioning, responded to low doses of benzodiazepines, particularly Versed 5 mg intravenous.
Secretions steadily improved, however he was still requiring frequent nasotracheal suctioning.
He received five cycles of radiation therapy and generally tolerated well.
Further radiation and chemotherapy was deferred given the patient's comorbidities until he improved in strength.
Of note, the patient did not have a bone scan for further definitive staging of his mild small cell lung carcinoma given constraints while he was on the ventilator.
Question whether this is related to pleural base pulmonary process resolving with treatment of underlying pulmonary disease.
He occasionally required restraint as he, on several occasions, attempted to get out of bed.
Geriatrics consultation was obtained given above and they recommended initiating Zyprexa therapy 2.5 mg po bid.
The patient had a generalized tonic clonic seizure post cardiac rest and was initially treated with Dilantin.
It is felt to be related to metabolic abnormalities during his arrest and after four to five days od therapy, Dilantin therapy was discontinued and the patient had no subsequent episodes of seizure.
NUTRITION:  Given the patient's initial pneumonic process which was potentially aspiration related and his difficulty in managing his airway given his secretions and his subcarinal tumor and his pulling out his nasogastric tube on a couple of occasions, we were somewhat concerned about oral refeeding.
Given the lack of utility of speech and swallow study in this patient as he is most likely an aspiration risk, will initiate oral feeds using standard aspiration precautions.
Should he not respond to conservative measures, formal speech and swallow evaluation, plus minus PEG tube placement might be necessary.
Non small cell lung carcinoma, stage 3A 2.
Aspiration pneumonia with copious residual secretions requiring aggressive suctioning 4.
Albuterol and Atrovent metered dose inhalers 2 puffs qid 2.
Protonix 40 mg po q day 3.
Zyprexa 2.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] 4.
Oxygen 4 liters by nasal cannula and prn 10 liter shovel mask 5.
D5 one half normal saline 100 cc per hour  CARE NOTES:  The patient needs frequent chest physical therapy and nasotracheal suctioning.
If agitated during suctioning, he responds to 5 mg of intravenous Versed.
He should have his diet advanced as tolerated with aspiration precautions including head of bed to 90??????
while feeding, thickened liquids and clearing his airway post feeding.
