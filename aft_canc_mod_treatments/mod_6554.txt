Right PICC line in place without erythema.
Beginning at 18:00 hours, the background activity became very low voltage with a burst suppression pattern of activity with bursts of low voltage delta activity lasting for about one second alternating with bursts of relative suppression of the background for about one second.
The second pushbutton activation was at 17:34:46 to note for Dilantin load.
A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present.
A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present.
Normally-functioning mechanical bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis.
Transgastric views not obtained given ongoing GI bleeding.
MRI Head ([**5-14**]): Right transfrontal ventriculostomy catheter is again demonstrated with tip crossing midline to terminate in the left lateral ventricle, better demonstrated on prior CT.
Slit-like ventricles and thin bilateral extra- axial collections, likely subdural effusions, raise the possibility of "overshunting" in this setting.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were 14 entries in this file for muscle, movement, and electrode artifacts.
Right common iliac, external iliac and common femoral vein thrombosis.
Portable CXR: ([**2124-5-26**])FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-25**], the endotracheal tube has been removed and tracheostomy tube is in place.

She was transferred intubated and unresponsive for further management.
# Altered mental status/unresponsiveness - Pt had recent intraventricular hemorrhage in the setting of anticoagulation for which she had been admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] and now was at a nursing home/rehab.
She was therefore started on phenytoin for possible seizure activity.
There were multiple family discussions addressing goals of care and [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy decided to proceed with PEG tube placement and tracheostomy.
The patient received a tracheostomy, G-tube and J-tube on [**2124-5-25**].
# Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting of unresponsiveness.
She was continued on mechanical ventilation.
She failed spontaneous breathing trial on [**5-23**] secondary to episodes of apnea and a tracheostomy was placed on [**2124-5-25**].
Her ventilator settings are as follows: Pressure support PSV: 15, PEEP: 5, FiO2: 40%, pulling Vt: 250-330, breathing at a rate of 20 (19-27), O2sat: 100%.
A  left-sided subclavian line had been placed 5 days previously; subsequent films had been negative for pneumothorax.
Thoracic surgery was consulted and placed a left-sided pigtail catheter with interval re-expansiopn of lung.
Pneumothorax stabilized radiographically and pigtail catheter was removed on [**5-23**] with stable chest X-rays after removal.
# s/p Cardiac arrest: Trop leak and worsening ST depressions on EKG at OSH prior to arrival.
Peak troponin 0.7, this was felt to be demand ischemia.
Initially, she was not given heparin or ASA given GI bleed; however, both have subsequently been started.
# UGIB: NGT placed at OSH was draining BRB with hct drop 36--> 27.
The gastroenterologists recommend that she be continued on a PPI [**Hospital1 **] for the next month until follow up with GI.
# s/p MVR (MECHANICAL VALVE): Had previously beeen anti-coagulated for what had been documented as a porcine valve; however, on arrival INR was subtherapeutic s/p FFP and vitamin K at OSH for acute UGIB.
Anti-coagulation was not reinitiated initially given that she had acute GI bleed and anti-coagulation would not be indicated for porcine valve.
However, she subsequently underwent trans-esophageal echocardiography which revealed that the patient actually has a MECHANICAL mitral valve therefore anti-coagulation was restarted.
Her anticoagulation was held on [**2124-5-25**] for her Tracheostomy and PEG and restarted on [**2124-5-26**].
Her INR goal will be 2.5-3.5 given her mechanical valve.
Vancomycin was intiated on [**2124-5-11**] and given her mechanical valve should be continued until [**2124-6-22**] to complete a 6 week course.
She will need weekly labs while on vancomycin including: CBC, chem 10, LFTs, and Vancomycin level.
# Diabetes Mellitus, Type II: The patient is on a insulin sliding scale with long acting insulin and her fingersticks have been well controlled, ranging 100-176 in the past 24hrs.
Her blood sugar will need to be monitored more closely as tube feeds are intiated and her insulin regimen should be adjusted PRN.
Started on thryoid replacement on [**5-17**].
# FEN:  The patient's was started on TF (nutren pulmonary) on [**2124-5-26**] at 10ml/hr advancing to a goal fo 43ml/hr.
Tube feeds should be given through the J-tube and medications should be given through the G-tube.
NO MEDICATIONS IN THE J-TUBE.
She is quite volume overloaded on exam given that all her medications and fluids have been IV over the past 2 weeks.
We have been diuresing her with a goal of -1L day with lasix boluses PRN.
