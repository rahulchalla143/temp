His hemoptysis improved and he was discharged to complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin and clindamycin.
His antibiotics were initially broadened, but was discharged on levoquin and clindamycin given clinical improvement.

Right non-tunneled internal jugular vein double-lumen central line placed.
The right neck and groin were prepped and draped in a sterile manner.
Initially under ultrasound guidance, access was obtained using a micropuncture needle into the right internal jugular vein, and pre- and post-access hard copy ultrasound images were obtained.
An angled catheter and [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire were used to access the main pulmonary artery, and over this, a modified 90 cm 6 French guiding catheter was advanced into the right main pulmonary artery.
A 4Fr pigtail catheter was placed through this and angiography was performed in multiple projections.
Next, right lower lobe branches in the medial aspect of the right lower lobe, corresponding to recent CT findings were accessed and selective third and fourth order pulmonary angiography was performed in multiple projections using a 5 French catheter and ultimately a Transcend wire and STC catheter.
Attempts to advance a Headliner and double-angled Glidewire into the small artery were unsuccessful, and embolization could not be performed.
This was accessed using a headliner wire and an STC catheter, which was positioned well into the branch.
Next, particle embolization with 300-500 micron Embospheres was performed to stasis.
Both the venous sheath and the arterial sheath were removed and manual compression was applied to hemostasis of the groin.
Placement of a 7 French double-lumen central line with the tip in the SVC, non-tunneled.
Specifically, in one or two projections, a focal round filling defect was noted.
The right branch could not be accessed due to its diminutive size and inability to advance the microcatheters adequately into the artery, and so no embolization was performed.
The ET tube has been advanced, currently in appropriate position approximately 7 cm above the carina, at the level of the clavicular heads.
He had multiple episodes of trace to mild penetration with thin liquids by cup which appeared to be related to a mild swallow delay.
On consecutive sips of thin liquid, he had reduced coordination / increase in swallow delay and had resultant mild- moderate aspiration before the swallow.
TREATMENT TECHNIQUES: Pt benefited from smaller, single sips of thin liquids that prevented aspiration on today's exam.
SUMMARY: Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with a mild oral and pharyngeal dysphagia with penetration of thin and nectar thick liquids and one episode of aspiration on consecutive sips of thin liquid with ineffective spontaneous vs cued cough.
It appears aspiration can be prevented with compensatory techniques below which the pt demonstrated excellent understanding of.
PO diet of thin liquids and regular consistency solids with the following precautions: a) single sips of liquids only- no consecutive sips b) swallow 2 x's for each bite and sip c) follow solids with a sip of liquid if you feel residue in your throat d) limit mixed consistencies w/ liquids and solids (cereal with milk, chicken noodle soup)- if eating them, drain the liquid from the spoon and eat solids first, followed by liquids 2.
On the medicine floor on the afternoon of [**10-15**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] again had 500cc of hemoptysis, with concomitant, transient desaturation to the 70%.
A hypertrophic bronchial artery was found and embolized.
His sertraline was tapered from 150 mg to 100 mg daily for concerns that this might be contributing to bleeding risk.
Per pulmonary, Pt will need to continue levofloxacin 750 mg po daily and clindamycin 450mg po 6hrs for 4 more weeks and have pulmonary appointment in [**2-7**] weeks, who will arrange follow-up workup and repeat imaging.
Pt describes as sternal "heaviness" after his pulmonary embolization procedure.
Holding aspirin in setting of acute bleed.
Outpatient propranolol 20mg po bid was restarted w/out incident.
Held metformin in-house, provided insulin sliding scale.
Pt will need to address sertraline taper with outpatient psychiatrist.
Anxiety disorder: continued clonazepam 2mg po qhs.
Pt also asked for clonazepam 1mg po tid prn anxiety.
Continued home levothyroxine .
# Chronic pain:  continued on home oxycontin and vicodin.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Further work-up as dictated by pulmonary specialists to continue to evaluate for possible underlying malignancy.
- Consideration for gastric motility study.
- Consideration for further tapering of sertraline dose.

You received a blood transfusion and you were transferred to the medical intensive care unit, where a breathing tube was placed to help protect your airway.
You had a rigid bronchoscopy and pulmonary artery angiography and embolization procedure to find and stop the bleeding in your lung.
You tolerated the procedure well and had the breathing tube removed after one day.
You were then transferred to the medical floor, where you were closely observed and your antibiotics were continued.
By the day of discharge, you did not require any oxygen and were only coughing up occasional blood clots.
You had a video swallow study here which showed that you do aspirate materials when you take big gulps and mix solids and liquids.
They recommended a normal diet with the following precautions: a) single sips of liquids only- no consecutive sips b) swallow 2 x's for each bite and sip c) follow solids with a sip of liquid if you feel residue in your throat d) limit mixed consistencies w/ liquids and solids (cereal with milk, chicken noodle soup)- if eating them, drain the liquid from the spoon and eat solids first, followed by liquids, and medications whole with apple sauce or pudding.
-Start using Miconazole Powder 2% on your groin rashes three times daily as needed.
You should continue taking your other medications as previously prescribed.
It is especially important that you continue both your levofloxacin 750mg tabs, 1 tab by mouth daily, and your clindamycin 150mg tabs, 3 tabs by mouth every 6 hours, for 4 more weeks.
