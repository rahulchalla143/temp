911 was called and the patient later shocked back to a normal sinus rhythm from asystole documented on an automated external defibrillator.
Her transfer to the [**Hospital6 256**] from the [**Hospital6 **] was delayed by some difficulties in transferring her because of her ventilator dependence.
The patient has a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma status post mantle radiation in the 70s complicated by radiation pulmonary fibrosis.
The patient later underwent decortication of her left lung in [**2138-6-7**].
She was later discharged to a rehabilitation facility where she suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest later in [**2138-6-7**].

She was kept on a ventilator and received aggressive respiratory therapy.
On [**2138-10-17**], the patient was taken to the Operating Room for an open tracheostomy tube placement as well as a flexible bronchoscopy with tracheobronchial aspirations.
The patient required a repeat flexible bronchoscopy on [**2138-10-21**] following an episode of emesis during which he aspirated.
Although efforts were made to extubate her as early as possible, she continued to have thick yellow secretions that required frequent suction by respiratory therapy.
Due to the problem with aspiration, the patient was ultimately taken to the Operating Room for the placement of a jejunostomy tube.
Towards the end of her Intensive Care Unit admission she would tolerate significant periods of time off of the ventilator and began to ambulate.
Discharge planning was initiated with an aim of having the patient transferred to a rehabilitation facility for continued physical therapy, respiratory therapy, and close monitoring.
