Transverse colon compressed below the tip of the spleen, of uncertain clinical significance, correlate with clinical symptoms (if any).
CT HEAD [**2117-10-6**]:  Stable extent of large hemorrhage in the left frontoparietal lobes with stable rightward shift of midline structures.
Enlargement of temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of right lateral ventricle is suggestive of subfalcine herniation.
CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast [**2117-10-27**]: 1.
Minimally prominent bowel wall involving the descending colon with adjacent mesenteric stranding.
He was admitted to BMT service for work-up and treatment of ALL.
Upon admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 58834**] was started on IVF and allopurinol.
He was treated supportively with red cell and platelet transfusions.
Serial CBCs, tumor lysis labs, and coagulation profiles were sent to rule out tumor lysis and DIC.
Patient was offered enrollment in Clinical Trail DF#06-254 for treatment of adult ALL, and he accepted.
A sternal bone marrow aspirate was performed.
On day #2 of trial, patient had LP with intrathecal Ara-C, and he was started on methyl-prednisolone 27mg Q8.
He underwent treatment with vincristine, doxorubacin, peg L-asparaginase per [**Company 2860**] protocol for ALL.
Repeat bone marrow biopsy was not performed at this time given the patient's overall condition, and the fact that given his elevated liver enzymes, he would not be a candidate to undergo further therapy at this time.
He will follow-up with his oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2117-11-8**] for further management.
Due to inability to protect his airway, he was intubated with anesthesia at the bedside.
Due to intense systolic hypertension at the time of intubation (SBP 223) he received 20mg IV hydralazine as well as sedation with fentanyl, propofol and midazolam which normalized his blood pressures.
Neurology and Neurosurgery were consulted and Neurosurgery considered placement of extraventricular drain to help relieve intracranial pressure and prevent impending herniation, but upon discussion with Mr. [**Known lastname 84579**] family including his brother who is his health care proxy, the procedure was declined.
The following day, Neurology evaluation of imaging revealed superior sagginal sinus thrombosis and  suggested 4 vessel angigraphy and possible angio-jet procedure to evacuate the thrombus.
However, upon further discussion with Neurosurgery and the Bone Marrow Transplant team, a decision was made to start less invasive options -- hyperventilation and Mannitol to see how the patient responds.
HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA AND TRANSAMINITIS: Following chemotherapy, the patient was noted to have progressively increasing liver function tests and bilirubin levels.
While etiology of hyperbilirubinemia and transaminitis were not clear, it was believed that vincristine was the most likely cause.
FEVERS:  In ED, patient was started on cefepime and vancomycin for neutropenic fever.
While in the ICU, the patient also developed low grade fevers and was started on Micafungin for antifungal coverage, which was subsequently switched to Anidulafungin.
Broad spectrum antibiotics were stopped upon return to the BMT floor and resolution of patient's neutropenia as well as fevers.
The patient was started on Ciprofloxacin for empiric treatment of UTI and oral Flagyl plus Vancomycin for treatment of C. diff colitis.
Urine culture came back negative and Ciprofloxacin was discontinued prior to discharge.
The patient should continue oral Vancomycin for a 14 day total course.
ANXIETY:  Patient was continued on Zoloft 200mg QD.
He was given ativan prn for anxiety.
Mr. [**Known lastname 58834**] was started on acyclovir for treatment of HSV.
The patient was re-started on PO Vancomycin and PO Flagyl for empiric treatment of of C. diff.
He is scheduled to complete a 14 day course of PO Vancomycin and a 5 day course of PO Flagyl, after which he should be re-evaluated for persistent C. diff.
Oxycodone PRN for given for pain contol.
The patient was given Oxycodone via G-tube as needed for pain control.
PICC line was placed for hydration, TPN and administration of medications.

G-tube was successfully placed by Interventional Radiology service.
The patient was started on eneteral nutrition by tube feeds, which he has tolerated well.
