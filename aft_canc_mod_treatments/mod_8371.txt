69 y/o F w/ a h/o pansensitive TB on 3 drug regimen, MDS with pancytopenia, respiratory failure s/p trach placement and revision [**5-/2147**], recently admitted [**Date range (1) 102694**] with sepsis presumed [**12-23**] PNA (by MDR E coli, pseudomonas) who comes in from [**Hospital3 **] with increasing abdominal distension, drainage from GJ tube site and fever.
3 wk course of inhaled tobramycin and ciprofloxacin.
Given vancomycin and ceftaz.
2 L NS also given.
Started on meropenem and ceftaz as per ID.
Also, VRE from cath tip on [**6-21**], started on Daptomycin, however, daptomycin was discontinued due to negative blood cx for VRE on [**6-23**].
Tobramycin was added on [**6-19**] for double coverage of resistent pseudomonas given poor lung penetration of Cipro.
The full course of meropenem was completed on [**7-2**] and of tobramycin on [**7-3**].
3 wk course of inhaled tobramycin and ciprofloxacin.

KUB [**2147-8-19**] GJ-tube is present, the tip of which is probably in the distal duodenum or proximal jejunum.
The tracheostomy tube is unchanged.
Fluid and air tracking along the GJ tube site consistent with known clinical leak.
Foley catheter balloon is inflated within the urethra and should be repositioned.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 yo female with a history of disseminated TB, GJ tube placement after CVA with recent replacement, Serratia and Pseudomonas PNA and persistent intermittent fevers presenting with abdominal distension and fever, increased drainage from adjacent to GJ tube site and bloody secretions from trach site.
Recent hx of pneumonia including pseudomonas, serratia - with recent ([**2147-7-23**]) sputum culture showing strain of pseudomonas resistant to meropenem and cefepime - sensitive only to tobramycin - received treatment at that time.
Was treated with tobramycin and ciprofloxacin per culture sensitivities.
#G-J tube dysfunction - Admitted with nonfunctional G-J tubes, with copious draining from site (stomach secretions).
Additionally, the J-tube had no drainage, but resultant lab data after medication administration indicated her small intestine was not absorbing properly.
The day she expired, she again became septic following aspiration necessitating multiple fluid boluses.
Intrabladder pressure was measured at 45, likely resultant from bowel edema, giving evidence of likely intra-abdominal compartment syndrome, however, given her tenuous blood pressure surgical decompression was not an option.
[**5-30**] with hemoptysis considered likely due to obstruction of the tracheostomy tube and hemoptysis most likely related to granulation tissue or tracheal stenosis at the tracheostomy site.
Throughout hospital stay was transfused with multiple units of platelets when either her level was <10 or she developed oozing at trach or G-J site.
Tube feeds were resumed.
While initially septic she was started on an insulin drip for tight glycemic control but later transitioned to a sliding scale once more stable.
Thoracic surgery was consulted concerning potential biopsy, but we were ultimately unable to have this done as she was too unstable for the operating room.
#Disseminated TB: Continued on four drug regimen while inpatient.
Began pursuing biopsy of lymph nodes, but were ultimately unable due to the severity of her illness.
She was treated aggressively with fluid resuscitation, antibiotics and pressors to maintain her blood pressure.
She was treated with chest compressions, epinephrine and atropine, however she failed to regain a sustainable rhythm and she was pronounced dead.
