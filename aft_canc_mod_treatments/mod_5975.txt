This filling defect in the pulmonary artery could represent a saddle embolism, however, due to the increased density of contrast and early bolus timing, mixing artifact in the pulmonary artery should also be considered.
Pt was started on heparin for treatment of PE, and later transitioned to warfarin 5mg with lovenox bridging.
Lovenox was discontinued on [**7-25**] given supratherapeutic INR of 3.2, and warfarin held [**7-25**] and restarted at 2.5mg on [**2129-7-26**].
She will likely require at least a one-year course of anticoagulation given her degree of cardiac impairment, with the duration to be weighed against the risk of bleed.
In the CCU, she was first diuresed with a furosemide drip, then transitioned to IV boluses and with good effect.
She was transferred back to the floor after ~2.5L diuresis with stable BP and O2 sats 90-94% RA.
She appeared to have improving forward flow and on discharge, O2sat 93% on RA and furosemide requirement 20 mg PO daily, with possibility of weaning patient off furosemide in outpatient setting.
She did receive Mucomyst for her CTA chest, and all of her medications were renally dosed.
This was likely secondary to medication effect from ativan and haldol received in the ED as well as due to acute illness including hypoxia and hypotension.
She did have several nights of agitation requiring soft restraints and IV Haldol, but 2 nights before discharge, patient slept through the night and did not require chemical or mechanical restraints.
As mentioned above her Remeron was held since it was thought to possibly be contributing to her change in mental status.
A nutrition consult was requested, and they recommended low sodium diet of pureed solids, thin liquids, and Ensure supplements.
Because the patient did not consistently finish PO meals, nutrition recommended 1584 Kcal/70g protein tube feeds at 55 ml/hr if it was consistent with the patient's goals of care.
The patient's guardian [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 96421**] stated that tube feeds were not desired at this time.
Bradycardia: Pt had been on metoprolol per NH records although this had been discontinued per her most recent PCP note in [**10-2**] due to possible role in TIA.
She also had been noted to have asymptomatic episodes of bradycardia to 30s in the past which were also observed on this admission.
