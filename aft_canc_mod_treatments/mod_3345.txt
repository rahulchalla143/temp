MRI repeat([**9-21**]): 1) Unchanged appearance of rim enhancing mass within the right cerebral hemisphere resulting in a large amount of vasogenic edema with leftward shift of the mid-line by approximately 1.5 cm.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname **] was admitted to manage cerebral edema that occurred s/p stereotactic radiosurgery for his brain met.
He was initially started on Dexamethasone 6IV q6h and Mannitol 25 q6.
As a result, his mannitol was titrated up ,and when this didn't improve matters, his decadron was increased to 10 mg IV q6h.
Neurosurgery was also reconsulted and decided that no surgical intervention was needed at the time.
He was also having trouble ambulating due to a persistent lean to the left.
As he improved, the mannitol was gradually weaned to off, and his decadron was slowly dropped to a final dose of 6 mg q8h.
He also had 2-3 episodes of tonic seizure activity followed by post-ictal nonresponsiveness.
He was then quickly treated with 100 g IV mannitol and a total of 18 mg IV decadron.
He had to be sedated on a propofol drip due to constant rigors, and was sent for immediate neurosurgery.
He went for right frontal craniotomy with resection of tumor to treat uncal herniation of right insular mass with edema.
Blood cultures were negative and he was started on Levofloxacin, Flagyl, and Vancomycin.
He was afebrile on antibiotics and they were continued for 3 days.
After the antibiotics were stopped he was febrile again and they were restarted for a 10 day course.
Ampicillin was added to his antibiotics for possible Listeria.
His mental status continued to decrease and he was started on manitol.
His brain metastasis were treated with 5 days of whole brain XRT.
He had a PEG placed during his XRT as he was no longer able to feed himself adequately.
He was very gradually weaned off of the Manitol over the next 10 days.
After his antibiotics course was complete they were stopped and he spiked a fever.
At that time he had blood cultures with one set of corynebacterium and one set positive for coagulase negative staph.
He had a PICC line placed on [**2172-11-6**] for access.
He was started on Megace for treatment of his renal cell carcinoma.
He will continue on Antibiotics, Steroids, seizure prophylaxis, and PEG Tube feedings.
2.Seizure prophylaxis: He had been on dilantin before this admission, and was continued on his dose of 300 [**Hospital1 **].
This may be due to the fact that decadron can increase the metabolism of dilantin and he was on high doese of the steroid.
He was gradually moved up on dilantin, as he was requiring frequent one time doses in addition to his standing dose.
As his decadron was weaned though, his level began to increase, and we started to back down on his doses.
He was continued on Keppra and Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis post neurosurgery.
3.HTN: He was put on his home dose of metoprolol and maintained good BPS throughout without issue.
4.Nausea:He experienced some nausea on and off during the admission.
He was treated with Tylenol initially, then high doses of Vioxx.
He treated these well with hot packs.
We continued to treat his pain with Oxydodone as needed.
His aggitation was treated with Haldol around the clock with extra given PRN as needed.
6.Cancer: He was initially considered a possible cure, as his brain met will likely disappear after the SRS, his kideny is removed, and his lung mets are shrinking post-therapy and could be resected.
This likely means he is no longer totally cureable and that his treatment will need to be altered.
He has undergone 5 days of WBXRT for brain metastasis.
It is felt that this is due to a combination of seizure effect, brain metastasis, and brain edema from WBXRT.
