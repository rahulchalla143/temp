pt refusing internal rectal exam for me, though surgery did exam and per report no rectal masses GU: foley in place, good UOP Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  Discharge exam: Frail, older than stated age Afebrile, BP 124/64  HR 113, RR 18  96%3L more alert, still a little cloudy.
IMAGING: CXR: NG tube tip is either in the distal stomach or proximal duodenum.
The mediastinum is slightly prominent, possibly due to supine technique.
[**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully.
Protruding Lesions - A single sessile 5 mm non-bleeding polyp of benign appearance was found at ~18 cm.
A single non-bleeding diverticulum was seen in the cecum.
Impression: Polyp at ~18 cm Polyp in the rectum Diverticulosis of the distal sigmoid colon Diverticulum in the cecum Angioectasia in the 60 cm (thermal therapy) Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum Recommendations: Patient should have a repeat flex sig with polpyectomies and visualization of the rectum as an outpatient.
Clips were not used for AVM given likelihood that patient will need MRI for ongoing treatment and care of her lung malignancy.
Extensive bony metastatic disease involving a left anterior third rib, numerous vertebral bodies, and the sternum.
CXR ([**11-1**]): IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 7:01 p.m.: Moderate-sized right hydropneumothorax is still substantial, only mildly smaller following the insertion of a small-bore catheter in the right upper hemithorax.
Pleural Fluid Cytology ([**11-2**]): Atypical.

Per report, NG lavage at OSH was negative, given 1 unit PRBC, started on octreotide and Protonix drips and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
GI and surgery were consulted: surgery rec'd GI to scope and GI rec'd scope in AM.
She was also noted to have 2 sessile polyps, which were not removed, and will require outpatient flex-sig's for polypectomies at a later date.
Although her outpatient imaging studies had already previously shown the effusion, and was presumed to be a malignant effusion, no prior diagnostic thoracentesis had been performed.
A bedside thoracentesis was attempted by IP on [**11-1**], however, the patient developed a moderate sized pneumothorax and an anterior chest tube was placed at the bedside, with follow-up CXR showing good resolution of both the effusion and pneumothorax.
Chest tube was removed on [**11-3**] with no signs of reaccumulation of effusion and only small amt of pneumothorax.
# Metastatic lung ca, with malignant pain syndrome: pt is s/p radiation and chemotherapy x 2 sessions.
Initially was continued on her home pain regimen for her bone pain of methadone 5mg TID.
Palliative care was consulted, with attempt to increase her methadone, but she developed an acute encephalopathy with higher doses of methadone, 5 mg po bid and 10 mg po qhs.
She also has prn Oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
Orthopedics here recommened that her activity be partial weight bearing as tolerated, and that she ambulate with a walker or cane at all times.
Her outpatient Oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31966**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] on multiple occasions, but her functional status has declined significantly and her ability to tolerate further chemotherapy will need to be assessed after her strength improves.
Pain adequately managed, and receiving Ativan for anxiety as needed.
# Acute cystitis: Pt was found to have acute cystitis on [**11-3**] and started on a course of levofloxacin to be completed on [**11-10**].
Levofloxacin used over cipro given equivalent E coli coverage but better coverage of respiratory infections in this vulnerable pt with ?
# Urinary retention: On [**11-3**] soon after UTI diagnosis an attempt was made to DC foley but the patient developed urinary retention and foley replaced.
# Nausea:  She continues with nausea, likely multifactorial, that is improved with compazine and zofran.
She will require continued symptomatic management for nausea.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # COPD: continued flovent, albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed .
Hospice may need to be considered in the near future  Outstanding Transitional Issues: 1.  may need outpt flex-sig for polypectomies, assuming improved clinical recovery.

Discharge Instructions: You were transferred from [**Hospital3 10310**] Hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU with bloody stools.
During this hospitalization, you were transfused red blood cells and underwent a colonoscopy for your GI bleed.
You were also noted to have lots of fluid around your right lung, so you underwent a drainage of the fluid, which was complicated by partial collapse of the right lung, so a chest tube had to be placed.
You were evaluated by the Physical Therapists, and given your deconditioning and weakness, we think you will benefit from a stay at a rehab facility.
Decadron 4 mg for 3 more days 2.
