Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - [**2102**] TAH/BSO showed stage IIB ovarian Ca adjuvant treatment with six cycles of carboplatin and Taxol - [**2113-12-7**] had mammogram that showed a poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma, 8 mm in largest diameter, without LVI.
Imaging showed right axillary, subpectoral, and deep cervical lymph node involvement.
- [**2114-2-4**] treated with Adriamycin and Cytoxan followed by Taxol at the [**Company 2860**] followed by bilateral mastectomies(right modified radical mastectomy and left simple mastectomy) at [**Hospital1 2025**].
- [**2115-4-4**], she developed new lower back pain while undergoing planning for bilateral breast reconstruction surgery.
On [**2115-6-8**], she began induction chemotherapy with 7+3.
Her treatment course was complicated by prolonged neutropenic fevers, multifocal pneumonia requiring lung biopsy that demonstrated evidence of BOOP.
Her transplant was on [**2115-10-4**].
In [**2116-7-3**], she once again began  to develop low back pain with occasional radiation down her legs.
Pelvis MRI on  [**2116-8-6**], once again demonstrated diffuse marrow signal abnormality with near complete homogenous replacement of the right posterior ilium to SI joint, and marrow replacement of the left femur to the mid diaphysis.
-patient is being admitted for MEC chemo therapy given extent of relapse  OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: relapsed AML ovarian cancer [**2102**] breast cancer [**2113**]  Social History: Denies tobacco ever, EtOH (not now, was a social drinker years back), drug use.

[**2116-9-29**] Bone Marrow Biopsy: HYPERCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH EXTENSIVE NECROSIS AND EVIDENCE OF RELAPSED ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA.
[**2116-10-3**] CXR: Left PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC.
[**2116-10-17**] Bone Marrow Biopsy: Hypocellular bone marrow consistent with chemotherapeutic ablation.
Acyclovir and atovaquone were continued for prohylaxis (home regimen).
Patient required several transfusions of PRBCs and platelets during admission.
She was started on cefepime on [**10-5**], and remained afebrile for >1week.
PICC line was pulled for slight erythema, nonocclusive thrombus found at that time, so PICC could not be replaced.
Cefepime was discontinued on [**2116-10-20**] for diffuse rash.
Treated with daptomycin, aztreonam and ciprofloxacin.
RIJ was left in place, as patient has difficult access (cannot place line in right arm [**2-5**] lymphedema from previous mastectomy and now with clot in left arm from previous PICC).
Patient developed fever to 103.5F, [**10-22**] Blood culture grew E Coli while on atreonam and ciproflozacin.
The E coli in her blood cultures was found to be sensitive only to gentamicin and zosyn, so she was started on these two antibiotics.
Her intravenous abx were stopped a few days prior to discharge, and she remained stable with no evidence of infection.
Patient's BP recovered with volume expansion including 2units pRBC.
Patient was never pressor dependent.
After conferring with ID, abx were narrowed to daptomycin for previously documented VRE, and zosyn/gentamicin for empiric GNR coverage.
Patient was maintained on voriconazole, acyclovir, and atovaquone ppx.
# L PICC line assoc blood clot: Patient found on US to have a nonocclusive thrombus from her left PICC.
Instead of replacing PICC, IR placed a right IJ for access.
While this rash was clearing, she was started on zosyn (pipericillin-tazobactam) and developed a new, separate rash across her arms and some puffiness in her face.
Initially dermatology and ID felt it was possible to treat through this reaction (given the need for zosyn for her E. coli bacteremia), however when she developed swelling of her lips and itching of her throat, the medication was stopped.
Patient required a lidocaine patch for pain on the first day of her admission, however pain resolved by day 2.
Patient was also written for oxycodone prn, however she did not require it.
Opthomology was consulted who examined the retina, and found only a small cotton wool spot on right macula.
