He was treated with velcade and decadron and has recently completed his 6th course about 2wk ago.

He was called out to the floor where he was started on cefepime for febrile neutropenia.
He responded to a 1L bolus but then quickly became hypotensive again.
During his stay in the ICU, his major problems included infection for which he was continued on his antibiotics (vanco, ambisome, flagyl, acyclovir, adn , coagulopathy requiring product transfusion, continued hypotension complicated by significant peripheral edema, and continued diffuse bony pain.
A skeletal survey at that time showed probable multiple myeloma, and a Beta 2 microglobulin level was 22.0.

Change in mental status: On arrival to hospital, change in mental status thought to be due to hypotension/sepsis given that mental status improved markedly with fluids resuscitation.
Pt was then found to be altered with a normal BP after fluid resuscitation so an LP was done which demonstrated plasma cells in the CSF.
HIs antibiotics were stopped and the patients mental status cleared somewhat.
His initial blood cx grew out MRSA and he was started on vancomycin/cefepime and his line was removed.
He was started on stress dose steroids.
He was given ambisome for CT findings demonstrating likely worsening invasive aspergillosis and acyclovir for a history of disseminated zoster.
His antibiotics and steroids were stopped and further cultures/temperatures were not taken.
His pain was well controlled with a lidocaine patch and prn morphine.
