He was noted to have consolidation on CT chest and was going to be treated at home with Levofloxacin and home O2.
Unfortunately he was not able to get his oxygen set up and he was admitted for his dyspnea.

The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm with its tip not clearly seen.
Heterogeneous signal and enhancement with associated mass effect within the right frontotemporal lobe -partly characterized on the recent CT scan and outside neck MRI from [**Month (only) **].
While the above findings could reflect post-radiation change as previously suggested, consideration should be given to the possibility for radiation induced neoplasm, related to CML/sarcoma of the face/denovo or even graft-versus-host disease.
Further characterization is suggested, which could take the form of a Thallium/PET scan and/or biopsy.
Respiratory Failure: Patient was noted to be increasingly hypercapnic on prior admission.
He was treated with vanco, CTX, levaquin.
He was transferred to BMT floor, however he had a witnessed aspiration event leading to eventual re-intubation on [**2-28**].
Patient was treated for hospital associated aspiration PNA with vanco, cefepime, Flagyl.
Patient was diuresed aggressively in attempts to clear pleural effusions and re-expand lung, however, Cr began to rise after massive diuresis with lasix gtt and further diuresis was not possible.
He eventually had tracheostomy placed [**2155-3-12**].
On discharge, he had been weaned to trach mask off vent for several hours on [**3-20**] but was placed back on AC after witnessed aspiration [**2155-3-20**].
He was continued on azithromycin for his bronchiolitis obliterans.
At discharge, vent settings: Pressure Support 10, PEEP 5 FiO2 60%.
Given ICU team's concern for seizures, patient was transitioned from fosphenytoin to Keppra.
Patient was initially treated empirically with acyclovir and ampicillin until HSV PCR was negative and final cx ruled out Listeria.
He was continued on fentanyl patch and prn morphine and zyprexa.
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, with presumed source being previously undertreated PNA.
He was able to be weaned off pressors and remained hemodynamically stable.
Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient and continued on prednisone 5mg PO daily.
Bactrim and Acyclovir for prophylaxis were held due to renal failure but could be restarted as outpatient if kidney function does not recover and he is continued on HD.
He was well controlled on diltiazem drip.
After several discussions with heme/onc team, cardiology and ICU team, it was determined that patient was not good candidate for ablation procedure and it would be most appropriate to treat with rate control.
Patient was transitioned to PO dilt as well as metoprolol was rate controlled with HRs 80s-110s.
He had a witnessed aspiration event and he subsequently failed speech and swallow for all PO's.
Heme/onc team thought that with improved nutrition for several weeks, patient could regain strength and be reassessed for taking POs.
After several family discussions, family initially did not want to pursue PEG but they changed their mind and he ultimatley had IR guided PEG tube placed and was started on tube feeds.
[**Last Name (un) **]: Patient's creatinine began to rise after aggressive diuresis with lasix gtt during second intubation.
