[**7-27**] right sternoclavicular joint first rib *** [**7-27**] pectoralis muscle *** [**7-27**] sternoclavicular fluid *** [**7-19**] Urine cytology: Urothelial cells, histiocytes, and neutrophils.Many squamous cells, anucleate squames, and bacteria consistent with vaginal contamination.Note: Atypical squamous cells consistent with low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) are present.
These plasma cells are small with eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentrically located nuclei.
Mass, right chest wall (A-B):     a.  Skeletal muscle with chronic, patchy mildly active inflammation.
In an immunocompromised host, this could be due to invasive fungal organisms, actinomycosis, and TB, among others.
Four fluid collections identified around the transplanted kidney in the left lower quadrant.
Hyperdensities in native kidneys, particularly in the right upper pole likely represent hemorrhagic cysts, particularly given appearance on recent MRI.
Volume overload is demonstrated by bilateral pleural effusions, pericardial effusion, anasarca, periportal edema and mild ascites.
Decrease in size of anterior right chest wall abscess with two drains in place and minimal residual fluid.
[**7-19**] shoulder MRI:IMPRESSION: 1.
There is a hazy opacity in the right mid zone, corresponding to the right lung abnormality seen abutting the anterior chest wall on the [**2101-7-21**] CT scan.
[**2101-7-27**]: AP UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is new moderate right-sided pneumothorax with partial collapse of the entire right lung following resection of the medial one-third of the right clavicle and first anterior rib.
The patient is after recent resection of the part of the clavicle and adjacent chest wall debridement.
Medial right clavicle has been resected.
[**2101-8-4**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there again is evidence of increased pulmonary venous pressure, mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, bilateral pleural effusions, and evidence of resection of the medial aspect of the right clavicle.
Dilatation of the gas-filled stomach persists, for which a nasogastric tube might be helpful.
medial chest drains are again noted.
Discharge Labs:   Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 50 year old female with PMH of asthma, poorly controlled DM1 with last A1C of 13, HTN, ESRD s/p living related donor renal transplant in [**2092**], who was admitted for fevers and UTI, and found to have pneumonia, vegetative endocarditis and abscesses of chest wall and perinephric growing group B strep.
Given patient's history of PCN allergy, she was started on IV vancomycin for coverage of the abscesses.
When patient was showing only slow improvement, and there were new findings of infarct of the rostrum of patient's corpus callosum and formation of mycotic aneurisms, it was decided that patient should undergo PCN de-sensitization in the ICU and initiate PCN therapy.
Cardiothoracic surgery debrided the abscess and removed infected portions of patient's clavicle and first rib.
Plastic surgery closed the wound with a flap, and patient was discharged with instructions to follow up in office for suture removal and JP drain removal.
IV PCN therapy was administered as definitive treatment for patient's GBS infection.
Culture of the drainage grew GBS sensitive to PCN, and served as the target organism for antibiotic therapy with regards to patient's multiple areas of infection.
Patient was d/c'd with a PICC line and instructions to follow up with infectious disease as she is completing PCN therapy at rehab.
Infarct of Rostrum of Corpus Callosum and Mycotic Aneurisms: Patient experienced several vasovagal syncopal episodes in house, and during the workup of one of these episodes, the findings of acute infarct of the rostum of the corpus callosum and two areas of probable mycotic aneurism were seen on MRA.
Felt to be caused by septic emboli from patient's vegetative endocarditis, these lesions were treated with IV PCN as were patient's other infectious foci.
These episodes can be explained by patient's rapidly changing fluid status related to multiple surgeries, and by a degree of relative adrenal insufficiency in the setting of prolonged stress from surgery and infection.
Acute renal failure: On presentation, patient's creatinine was as elevated to 2.2 from baseline 1.1.
Patient was given IV fluids during her hospitalization and by discharge patient's creatinine recovered to baseline.
Anasarca: With multiple surgeries and procedures, and with possible relative AI and low vascular tone in the setting of infection, patient intermittantly required administration of crystalloid solution to support intravascular volume.
The right pleural effusion was tapped, a chest tube was temporarily placed, and labs showed transudative fluid so chest tubes were discontinued.
Oozing of blood from sites of intervention: Patient had a drop of Hct on [**8-12**] and she had oozing of blood from previous sites of intervention including site of chest tube.
Prednisone was continued but at stress dosing and was decreased on discharge.
The [**Hospital **] Clinic was consulted on this admission and good glucose control was achieved on insulin schedule.
Patient was taking plavix but because of concern for bleed and fall it was held.
