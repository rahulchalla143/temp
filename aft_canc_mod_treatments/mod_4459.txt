Admission Date:  [**2173-2-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2173-3-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2108-11-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**] Chief Complaint: lung cancer with tumor invasion of bronchi  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2173-2-25**] - flexible bronchoscopy  [**2173-2-26**] - Rigid bronchoscopy, tumor debridement using mechanical debridement and cryotherapy of the right main stem/bronchus intermedius tumor, placement of an uncovered 12 x 20-mm stent in the bronchus intermedius with balloon dilation of the stent, placement of right Pleurx catheter into the right pleural space under ultrasound guidance with drainage of pleural effusion  [**2-28**] - Rigid bronchoscopy, tumor destruction with mechanical debridement and ablation argon plasma coagulation  [**2-28**] - Flexible bronchoscopy with tumor debridement and therapeutic aspiration of secretions   History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a  64 y/o female with a history of stage IV lung cancer that was first diagnosed on [**2168**] and treated at that time with chemoradiation therapy.
She was recently admitted to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital on [**2173-1-12**] for progressive cough and weakness and was found to have an enlarging right hilar mass, with associated pleural effusion and a thoracentesis that yielded positive cytology.
She was started on antibiotics (Zosyn) at OSH for a possible postobstructive pneumonia.
During her hospital stay in [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital she was also found to have recurrent SVTs with reentry, atrial flutter/fibrillation in/out that had been partially responsive to iv diltiazem.
These have been completely asymptomatic and have improved considerably with beta blockage.
She was treated with chemotherapy and radiation only.
Following bronchus intermedius stent placement, persistent airway obstruction distal to the stent, with minimally aerosolized material, as well as encasement/marked narrowing of the right pulmonary artery.
Interval decrease in right pleural fluid following placement of pleural catheter at the right lung base.
Unchanged appearance of right suprahilar consolidative opacity and right upper lobe and anterior left upper lobe lung masses.
She was continued on unasyn for treatment of presumed postobstructive pneumonia and an admission WBC of 17.
On [**2-26**] she underwent mechanical debridement and cryotherapy of the airway with placement of a 12 x 20mm stent as well as placement of a right sided PleurX catheter into the right pleural space.
On [**2-28**] she underwent rigid bronchoscopy for further tumor debridement and was taken back later that day for flexible bronchoscopy and further tumor debridement a second time.
Postoperatively she was tachypneic and tachycardic and O2 saturations were transiently in the 50%s on room air; she was placed on CPAP noninvasive ventilation and O2 saturations rose quickly to the high 90%s.
After several minutes of CPAP her ABG improved to 7.37/39/126, and upon admission to the SICU she was transitioned off the CPAP to face mask.
Her PleurX catheter was drained and she had some symptomatic relief of symptoms.
She also underwent a flexible bronchoscopy at the bedside which reportedly did not reveal any abnormality, with the stent in good place.
Given that she had completed 36 Gy of XRT in the past, she was deemed not a candidate for Cyberknife, however she could potentially undergo conventional re-irradiation.
The patient and her family discussed her options with radiation oncology as well as interventional pulmonology, and she decided, given her grim prognosis, to transition to a hospice approach to her care, with the intention to go home as soon as possible.
She was transitioned to PO augmentin for a total 14-day course of antibiotics, and he was sent home for transition to home hospice.
