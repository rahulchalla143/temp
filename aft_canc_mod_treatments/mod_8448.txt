Initial vent settings were TV 400, RR 10, FiO2 100%, PEEP 5.
He was given 100mcg fentanyl and 1mg ativan for sedation.
His ABG after intubation was 7.16/85/499/32.
Rate control was attempted with 0.5mg IV digoxin but was unsuccessful.
He then got IV diltiazem 5 mg x 2 that brought his rate to 120's with stable pressure.
He was transiently on phenylephrine (10ug/min to 40ug/min) and a received a total of 5 L normal saline.
