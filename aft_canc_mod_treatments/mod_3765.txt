She persisted to have fevers with chills while taking tylenol and [**8-23**] had a temp of 102 and came to ED.
She was started in heparin drip, given Cefepime 2 gm IV x1, and 1L NS then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring of her hypoxia.
Past Medical History: Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung [**6-25**] s/p chemo/XRT Metastasis to the r cerebellum in [**7-25**] Anxiety Depression Type 2 DM x 2 months Uterine CA in '[**10**] s/p XRT  Social History: She is married and retired.
Family History: Pertinent in that her mother died at age 62 with complications of diabetes, and someone in her family either her mother or sister evidently had renal cell carcinoma.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo female w/ PMHX significant for a recent diagnosis of NSCLC s/p chemo/XRT admitted for persistent fever, SOB, cough x 5 days and found to have leulocytosis, elevated D-dimer, and new LLL findings on CXR.
The following issues were addressed during her extended hospitalization:  1.Pulmonary/PE: She did not have a CTA initially due to dye allergy.
She was put on heparin empirically and D-dimer was drawn and very high.
She was continued on the heparin after this finding.
She was also continued on oxygen and was maintaining good O2 sats.
Due to a recent study in the NEJM, which showed a benefit of LMWH over coumadin in cancer patients at preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism, she was started on Lovenox instead of coumadin.
SHe also continued to require oxygen to keep her sats up.
She was switched back to a heparin drip for several days in order to have invasive procedures undertaken without problem.
After this, she was put back on Lovenox and had no issues with her PEs.
She was sent out on Lovenox 1 mg/kg [**Hospital1 **] to prevent recurrence of DVT or PE.
This was treated as an outpatient for 4 days with levaquin with no improvement.
When she was admitted, she was started on Unasyn in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
No other source of infection was identified, as she had negative blood cultures, negative urine cultures, and no obvious source of cellulitis/skin involvement.
Pulmonary was consulted and performed a bronchoscopy.
They found that she had no complete airway obstruction, but did have some partial compression of her airways by her tumor.
ID was consulted, and she was started on IV fluconazole and azithromycin.
SHe continued to spike daily fevers through her antibiotics though.
It was treated with 100% NRB oxygen and followed by serial CXRs.
Another though physical was performed, with no evidence of skin infection/abscess, oral infection, otitis, sinusitis, or perirectal abscess.
As she had finished a full course of fluconazole with really no change, this medication was stopped.
She was also switched to PO cipro and augmentin which continued to cover her for all possible gram positive and negative pathogens that we were covering with with her IV antibiotics.
The hypothesis on post-obstrucive pneumonia was the most likely, and as she was not a candidate for a pulmonary stent, the plan became to continue radiation therapy and also to restart low dose chemo, with the hope of shrinking the tumor and relieving the obstruction.
With this, she was eventually sent home with the PO ciprofloxacin and augmentin.
Her fevers were controlled with tylenol throughout the hospitalization and this worked well.
She was also on atrovent nebs here fairly regularly, which helped to keep her breathing easier and her oxygen requirements down.
Albuterol wasn't used often due to her already persistent tachycardia.
5.Lung cancer: She continued to receive XRT for most of her hospitalization.
She also received several cycles of [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol while an inpatient, but at low doses due to her acute illness.
She will continue with this new protocol as an outpatient.
SHe will continue with daily outpatient XRT and weekly chemo with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**].
6.Diabetes: She was kept on her home glipizide dose and RISS to cover for any high blood glucoses.
She had fairly good control throughout, with occassional high numbers on days after she received steroids for chemo premedication.
She was given ativan prn for this and it worked well.
She also used codeine cough syrup at nights, which helped her cough and her insomnia.
This was treated with miconazole powder effectively.
This was treated with Nystatin S&S along with the IV fluconazole.
It resolved with these therapies.
She did require oxygen while ambulating and at rest though.
She was continued on her Cipro and Augmentin, as well as Lovenox.
She continued to have daily fevers, but they were well controlled with tylenol and she sometimes had to use ibuprofen in addition.
She also got MDIs and codeine to help ease her breathing and to help control her cough at night.
