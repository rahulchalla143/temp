Brief Hospital Course: Following admission she was taken to the operating room where aortic valve replacement was performed.
She had recucurrent rapid atrial fibrillation postoperatively which was treated with IV Amiodarone, beta blockers and was somewhat refractory to treatment.
Aggressive diuresis was begun and tachy-brady episodes developed.
Electrophysiology was consulted and Amiodarone was continued for the rapid ventricular response.
Diltiazem likewise hurt her blood pressure and finally digoxin was given and along with Amiodarone and low dose beta blocker her rate remained in the 100-120 range.
Amiodarone will be tapered down while at rehab.
With aggressive diuresis, including a Lasix infusion, pulmonary toilet and transient tube feeds, she continued to improve and was extubated on [**7-1**] for a second time.
She went on to develop a mild contraction alkalosis and was started on a short course of Acetazolamide which will continue at rehab.
She was ambulating with assistance  and physical and Occupational therapy worked wioth her while in the ICU.
She was drinking Ensure supplements with each meal and was started on Megace to encourage an increase in appetite.
Anticoagulation with Coumadin for her atrial fibrillation with a goal INR of 2.0 -2.5.
Coumadin was held for several days prior to discharge to rehab due to a slightly supratherapeutic INR.
She will need to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] a month after surgery and needs to follow up in the pacemaker clinic after discharge with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
