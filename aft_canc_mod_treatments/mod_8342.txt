Brief Hospital Course: VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA: patient presented to ER with feelings of fatigue x 1 week.
Found to be in V tach and was slightly symptomatic (fatigue, lightheadedness) he was given an amiodarone load of 150mg over 10 minutes IV and became hypotensive (initially thought to be due to amio however the determined that patient was septic).
Per the EP service he was started on a lidocaine drip x 24 hours.
He was then taken off of the drip as the VT had been related to his ongoing sepsis and when his blood pressure was stabilized and his infection was being treated the thought was his VT would not recur in the immediate sense.
Within 3 days his VT returned and he experienced sustained VT, asymptomatic, x 15 hours, refractory to amiodarone load x 2, lidocaine bolus x 2 and lidocaine drip, he converted to with procainadmide but then again reverted back to VT.
Initially treated with Vanc/Zosyn but switched to flagyl when C diff returned positive.
Stool output eventually began to increase on flagyl and this was switched to PO vancomycin, this was begun on [**12-4**] and this should continue for a 14 day course.
CHF: given initial sepsis, he was volume resuscitated with 6 liters of normal saline, eventually he was slowly diuresed and had a thoracentesis which relieved 1.5 liters of fluid from his pleural space, transudateive.
DM- insulin regimen adjusted to NPH 9 qam and 9 qpm with a sliding scale as inpatient, after patient's acute illness fully resolves he may need to go back to his home regimen of NPH 7 qam and 7 qpm with a sliding scale.
HYPERCOAGULABILTY: Patient hypercoagulable, despite coumadin he had spontaneous clots to his SMA and R lower extremity.

In the emergency room you were given amiodarone and lidocaine medications designed to stop your ventricular tachycardia.
You were given several liters of fluid and started on medication to keep your blood pressure up.
You were started initially on the antibiotics Vancomycin and Zosyn for 3 days.
You were started on PO flagyl on [**11-27**].
You briefly received IV flagyl and oral vancomycin, then placed back on a PO flagyl regimen.
It was then recommended by the ID doctors that [**Name5 (PTitle) **] receive oral vancomycin to treat your diarrhea.
You will need to continue to take this medication at home.
The electrophysiology doctors [**First Name (Titles) 103659**] [**Name5 (PTitle) 103660**] up your pacemaker, tried shocking your heart, and tried giving you a medication called procainamide.
You were taken by the electrophysiology team for an ablation of the part of your heart causing the abnormal rhythm known as VT or Vtach.
They feel that the ablation was successful and that you do not need an ICD placed as an impatient, but they would like for you to follow up as an outpatient.
During your stay you developed some impaired renal function this was likely due to your dehydration in the setting of your infection.
You should cover this eye with wet warm wash cloths 4-6 times per day and erythomycin ointment twice a day.
Please take all of your medications as directed.
Please keep all of your medical appointments.
