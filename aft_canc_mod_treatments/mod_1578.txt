Admission Date:  [**2126-11-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-12-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2064-9-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine / ct contrast  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8115**] Chief Complaint: Weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation, mechanical ventilation, extubation Incision and drainage of right axillary abscess Placement of central venous catheter   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 62 y/o M with a h/o metastatic melanoma with spine, brain, and adrenal mets who has had left sided weakness for months and has been developing right sided weakness over the past week thought to be related to a known C3-4 mass.
At that time he was started on a TPCH chemotherapy regimen (day [**4-19**]).
Additionally, the patient was recently seen by his PCP for the left sided weakness and his Dexamethasone regimen was increased to 10 mg Q6H with minimal improvement.
Started on Keflex on [**11-11**] by NP at oncologists office.
En route to the ED, the patient's FS was noted to be ~500 and he received Humalog at that time.
Received home insulin and became slightly hypoglycemic.
Otherwise denies any CP, palp, SOB, N/V/D, fever/chills, changes in bowel/bladder habits, weight loss, HA or vision changes.
He [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] sentinel lymph node biopsy without evidence of melanoma in his right axillary nodes.
Brain MRI on [**2124-1-25**] revealed multiple brain mets and a PET/CT on [**2124-1-25**] revealed widespread metastatic disease, including a worrisome cervical spine lesion.
On [**2124-1-26**], he [**Date Range 1834**] C-spine MRI confirming intramedullary metastasis at C3-C4.
He [**Last Name (STitle) 1834**] bronchoscopy and left adrenal biopsy on [**2124-1-26**] with the left subcarinal LN showing no malignant cells and the left adrenal bx c/w metastatic melanoma.
He completed a 5 day course of C-spine radiation at [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2124-2-9**].
C-spine MRI revealed slight increase in the C3-C4 mass and increased edema and he was started on prednisone.
- [**8-22**] started on Temodar  Past Medical History: # Diabetes -- diagnosed in [**2113**] # Hypertension # Hypercholesterolemia # Vasectomy ([**2103**])   Social History: He is retired from the insurance industry and also taught computer at a private middle school on [**Location (un) 945**].
Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSCIAL EXAM: Vitals- 96.5 100/64 111 13 98%2L General- Appears well and in NAD, joking in bed HEENT- PERRLA, EOMI, anicteric, MM Dry, Op clear CV- RRR, S1 and S2, no m/r/g Lung- CTAB, no w/r/r Abdomen- Soft, NT/ND, BSx4 Extremity- Two areas of erythema on the right anterior chest.
# MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] ([**2126-11-14**] at 5:51 PM): FINDINGS: The intramedullary heterogeneously enhancing lesion at C3/C4 level is stable in size and morphology, currently measuring 14 (craniocaudal) x 11 (anteroposterior) x 10 (coronal) mm.
Stenosis at this level is exacerbated by unchanged central disc protrusion.
An enteric tube is in place with tip coiled within the stomach.
CT PELVIS: The bladder is partially collapsed, containing nondependent air, likely related to Foley catheter placement.
Likely post-procedural right anterior chest wall subcutaneous emphysema; correlation with any recent history of instrumentation is recommended.
# MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] ([**2126-11-27**] at 6:28 PM): FINDINGS: Cervical vertebrae are normal in height and alignment.
Pre- and paravertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.
In the ED patient's blood glucose was 500 so likely he was simply volume depleted secondary to osmotic diuresis in his hyperglycemic state.
THIRD ICU COURSE: On hospital day 10, patient developed hypotension and tachycardia in the setting of missing 2 doses of Unasyn due to loss of IV access.
His antibiotics were broadened to vanc/zosyn and he responded well hemodynamically.
On his third ICU course, his hypotension was attributed to sepsis in the setting of Pseudomonas bacteremia, which was thought to be due to infection of the right axillary abscess with Pseudomonas (also isolated from culture of the axillary wound).
The patient had been on Keflex since [**2126-11-11**] and received 1 dose of Vancomycin in ED.
The patient's presentation was likely related to patient's immunosupression with chronic steroids and chemo.
The patient was covered with Vancomycin and Zosyn initially.
Infectious disease recommended Vancomycin and Unasyn.
He was initially restarted on Vancomycin and Zosyn; as susceptibilities returned, the patient was treated with Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin.
He stabilized and improved with platelet transfusion, ddAVP, IVF, and pRBC while in the unit.
Initially changed dexamethasone to hydrocortisone due to hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities but switched back to patient's original steroid dosing once he was stabilized.
# Melanoma: When the patient initially presented, he had been started on a new chemotherapy regimen.
Per hematology/oncology recs, TPCH chemotherapy was held because of acute kidney injury.
The patient's chemotherapy was held through the admission.
Initially, the patient refused to be managed by nurses for insulin and wanted to take his home medications.
He later agreed to follow an insulin sliding scale, and was started on insulin glargine as well.
His evening Lantus dose was uptitrated several times, but he continued to have elevated fingersticks.
He will need close followup from Endocrinology after discharge for further adjustment of his Insulin regimen.
# Hypertension: Given the patient initial presentation of hypotension, his home Lisionpril was held during his hospitalization and discontinued at discharge.
# Hyperlipidemia: His home Rosouvastatin was continued through the admission.
He received platelets early during his admission to prevent GI bleeding with transfusion goal to keep platelets greater than 50.
# Hypothyroidism: Patient's home dose of synthroid was continued through much of the hospitalization.
Because of the patient's prolonged dexamethasone course, he was started on PCP prophylaxis with Bactrim DS.
His Dexamethasone was increased back to 4 mg PO Q6H.
He was briefly treated with Fludrocortisone, but this was discontinued at discharge.
Endocrine consult felt that an adrenal or thyroid etiology for his hyponatremia was unlikely, but that he will need a slow taper of his steroids given his prolonged high dose course.
He will need to follow up with Endocrinology soon after discharge for management of his steroid taper.
# Transition of Care: -- Continue Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin for total of 4 weeks after negative blood culture on [**2126-11-24**].
-- Consider Infectious Disease followup for further antibiotic recommendations.
