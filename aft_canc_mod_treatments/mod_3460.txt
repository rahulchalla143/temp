At [**Location (un) 5871**], she was noted to be tachycardia and to have a positive UA, so was given vancomycin and Zosyn.
She cannot get a CTA due to iodine allergy.
She denies chest pain, abdominal pain, fevers, chills, headache, change in vision.
Patient was diagnosed with melanoma 2 years ago when she noted an enlarging groin node found to be positive for metastatic melanoma.
Patient underwent lymphadenectomy and was found to have positive inguinal, pelvic, ileac, and peri-aortic nodes.
She was then treated with two cycles of DTIC unsuccesfully.
She is now being treated by NIH Surgery Branch for adoptive cellular immunotherapy.
She is now approximately 1.5 months out from conditioning regimen and 1 month out from receiving TIL.
21-50 WBCs, small LE, protein 30, [**3-11**] epis, 21-50 hyaline casts .
Right-sided double-J ureteral stent with moderate associated hydronephrosis.
Persistent moderate hydronephrosis of the right kidney and right hydroureter suggestive of stent malfunction.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Ms.  [**Known lastname 73200**] is a 33 year old female with metastatic melanoma admitted with somnolence, liver failure, renal failure, new chylous ascites and persistent tachycardia of unclear etiology, who ultimately was made comfort measures only and passed away on a morphine drip with family at bedside.
Patient admitted with symptoms of fatigue and somnolence which appeared to me multifactorial.
Patient was taking standing opioids at home and presented with renal and liver failure, so impaired clearance of toxins and meds likely contributed to her mental status.
She was treated with vancomycin and zosyn.
Given that cultures were negative, positive UA was likely the effect of the ureteral stent which had been placed at NIH one month prior.
Urology evaluated the stent who felt it was working well, though CT abd/pelvis showed persistent hydronephrosis suggesting the possibility of stent malfuction.
Patient had mild ascites in [**8-14**], and was admitted with significant worsening of ascites over two months.
No history of cirrhosis, though patient has been receiving various chemotherapies (though exact medications unclear).
She had received chemotherapy (unclear which medications) > 1 month ago making marrow supression less likely.
Patient recently had right sided ureteral stent placed and presented with elevated Cr of 1.3 that did not respond to > 5 L of IVF.
Patient has end stage metastatic melanoma and failed multiple chemotherapy regimens.
She was receiving experimental chemotherapy from NIH with 11 percent tumor reduction.
After discussion with family, decision was made to make patient DNR/DNI and then comfort measures only.
She was placed on a morphine drip for comfort.
