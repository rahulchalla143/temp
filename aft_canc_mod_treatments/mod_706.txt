Admission Date:  [**2186-4-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2186-5-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2122-4-20**]     Sex:  F  Service:  Medicine/[**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit/Bone Marrow Transplant  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (status post autologous bone marrow transplant) who was recently admitted with syncope of unclear etiology who presented with a recurrent syncopal episode.
Electrophysiology felt there was no evidence of sinus node dysfunction and recommended atenolol and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor.
The patient was also started on Neurontin for headaches.
The patient was also started on prednisone as an outpatient for questionable temporal arteritis.
She was possibly confused for a few seconds and had bowel incontinence.
She is status post autologous bone marrow transplant from her brother in [**2185-2-5**].
She was initially treated with six cycles of CHOP with recurrence when diagnosed.
The patient then went on to have autologous bone marrow transplant in [**2179**].
The patient was treated with Rituximab in [**2184-7-5**] for nasopharyngeal recurrence.
The patient then went on to have an autologous bone marrow transplant in [**2185**].
Status post total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
ALLERGIES:  ASPIRIN, OXYCODONE, and CODEINE (which cause nausea and vomiting).
Folate 1 mg by mouth once per day.
Levothyroxine 75 mcg by mouth once per day.
Gabapentin 300 mg by mouth three times per day.
Prednisone 10 mg by mouth once per day.
Atenolol 25 mg by mouth once per day.
Her blood pressure returned to [**Location 213**] with an intravenous fluid bolus.
This was thought likely to be a recurrence of the patient's non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
The left internal carotid artery was anterolaterally displaced on imaging, and it was thought to be causing these syncopal episodes as well as vagal stimulation.
On [**4-29**], the patient was transferred to the Bone Marrow Transplant Service for further treatment and evaluation of possible lymphoma recurrence.
It was thought at the time of this dictation that the patient's mass was due to an [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus associated post transplant lymphoproliferative disease.
The patient received high-dose Decadron while in the Intensive Care Unit with resolution of her headache.
The patient was restarted on Decadron and then switched to prednisone 20 mg by mouth once per day.
The patient had some improvement, but she suffered from mild headaches which are relieved with Fioricet and morphine sulfate immediate release tablets.
The patient will likely continue weekly Rituxan while obtaining radiation therapy.
The patient will continue on Decadron 8 mg by mouth twice per day as well upon discharge.
The Neurology Service suggested starting medications propantheline and midodrine to offset vagal stimulation.
PAIN CONTROL ISSUES:  The patient's headaches were to be controlled with morphine sulfate immediate release.
The patient will not be discharged on Fioricet as this was thought to be causing withdrawal headaches.
She has adverse reactions to codeine and oxycodone, but she is able to take the morphine.
She will also continue on the steroids as explained above.
