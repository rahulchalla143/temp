This was conveyed to her and her family and she was offered surgical debulking and surgical staging by Gynecology/Oncology.
It was explained to them, however, that Mrs. [**Known lastname 96864**] has the capacity to make decisions on her own, and her health care needs to be discussed with her as well.
She was inconsistent as well throughout admission as to whether or not she wanted to undergo surgery or possible paracentesis with analysis of fluid for cytology and possible follow-up chemotherapy.
At the beginning of her hospitalization, it seemed as she did wish to undergo surgery, but later throughout her admission it was clear that she was very scared of surgery and did not feel that this was the best option, and preferred paracentesis.
Hematology/Oncology was consulted and recommended three treatment options; the first being surgical debulking and staging by Gynecology/Oncology with possible follow-up chemotherapy; the second, being abdominal paracentesis with analysis of fluid for cytology and pending the results palliative chemotherapy; the third being hospice care for Mrs. [**Known lastname 96864**].
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] of [**2115-9-23**], the patient has decided to proceed with laparotomy for staging and debulking purposes.
Therefore, she was started on lepirudin and maintained on a lepirudin drip for a goal PTT of 60-80.
She received one dose of Coumadin prior to consideration of surgery, and resulted in an elevated INR to 5.6, which subsequently came down to the 2.5 range.
Since she had a therapeutic INR, she was started on Coumadin with no need for overlap with the Lepirudin.
She had been receiving iron supplementation when admitted; however, she was not discharged on iron supplementation due to inability of iron supplementation to help with anemia of chronic disease.

She underwent cardiac preoperative evaluation while admission in case of possible surgical debulking and also to better convey risks and benefits to her family.
It was felt that her cardiac postoperative risk for death was 10-15%.
She had some oxygen desaturations and was maintained on 3 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.
She was aggressively diuresed with IV Lasix 80 mg b.i.d.
She was diuresed until her creatinine bumped to 1.3 and then diuresis was held, and then restarted the next day at the dose of 40 mg p.o.
