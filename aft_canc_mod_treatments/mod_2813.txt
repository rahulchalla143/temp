HOSPITAL COURSE:  Oncology - The patient returns with recurrence of Hodgkin's disease.
The patient is status post stem cell collection and is admitted for auto bone marrow transplant.
The patient underwent a preparation with Cytoxan and Mesna, increased TNN and Etoposide which was unremarkable.
Seven days prior to transplant, the patient was transplanted with her peripheral stem cells and had an uncomplicated course.
She was maintained on Allopurinol for tumorlysis.
She was maintained on routine anti- emetic care, intravenous fluids per protocol and routine oral care.

The patient was maintained on Vancomycin.
She had acute Redman's syndrome with Vancomycin and it was run over four hours with some premedication with Benadryl with improvement and resolution with the remainder of her Vancomycin treatment.
She further had spikes and she had a one day course of Ambazone for a spike to 101, and Fluconazole was discontinued.
Stretch speciation was sensitive for Vancomycin and Cefepime was discontinued once her ANC was greater than 1000.
She received a 110 dose of Ambazone which was discontinued, once her ANC was increased.
Acute renal failure - The patient was on [**6-28**], had an acute episode of renal failure with increase in creatinine from 0.5 to 1.7.
