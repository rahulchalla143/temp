In the emergency department, he received vanc and zosyn, and 4 liters of IVF.
Admission was planned for the floor, however given his persistent hypotension an ICU bed was requested and a central line was placed for pressors though after 5-6L IVF he had no pressor requirement.

He was treated with vanco/ertapenem until [**6-28**] when a repeat scan on [**6-28**] showed resolution of the previous colonic anastomotic leak, complete collapse without residual fluid involving both abscess cavities.
His drains were clamped at that time and pulled on [**7-4**].
His antibiotics were also discontinued on [**7-4**].
He was c/o left shoulder which he attributed to a shoulder injury he sustained while at physical therapy and has noted left shoulder pain with movement since that time.
Of note he is on chronic steroids and did receive flu vaccine [**10-16**].

EKG [**10-20**]: Sinus rhythm with baseline artifact.
The patient is status post prior partial colectomy with loop ileostomy in the right lower quadrant.
Hyperdensity along the left flank laterally, representing the residual of the previously drained collection where a pigtail catheter had been seen on [**6-28**], appears similar.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Suture line in the rectosigmoid junction is compatible with prior colonic anastomosis.
A few loops of small bowel in the upper pelvis protrude toward the skin surface at the site of a ventral abdominal wall defect.
Degenerative end plate irregularity at C4-C5, appears to have progressed compared to the prior examination with a Schmorl's node at C5.
The patient is status post splenectomy with lobulated enhancing structure in the left upper quadrant likely reflective of splenosis.
The stomach, small and large bowel are unremarkable with changes of prior partial colectomy and loop ileostomy in the right lower quadrant.
There is no pelvic or inguinal pathologic adenopathy though the patient is status post pelvic side wall lymph node dissection.
Mildly increased FDG-avidity along the proximal right humerus of uncertain significance.

medical including a history of complicated abdominal abcesses and presumed sarcoidosis presenting with fever, hypotension and leukocytosis.
He responded to IV fluid boluses and received a total of 7L during his ED and ICU stay.
Per ID recommendations, he was started on linezolid and meropenem in the ICU.
He did receive a dose of dexamethasone in the ED and a few dose of hydrocortisone for stress dose steroids in the ICU.
All blood cultures have been negative to date as well as urine and stool.
Crytococcus antigen, legionella antigen were negative.
Beta-glucan, galactomannan, Cocci Ab, Histo Ab/antigen were negative.
Therefore, it was decided that patient would be treated with IV meropenem and PO linezolid for a 14 day course of therapy to treated suspected bacteremia from an intraabdominal source given his prior complicated abdominal anatomy and history of abdominal abscesses/infection with MDR organisms.
Pt will be discharged home to complete his course of Linezolid and meropenem, 1 day of therapy left at time of discharge.
Flow was considered, but pathology felt that this was not indicated given lack of apparent blasts cells, but this can be considered in the outpatient setting as well as a bone marrow biopsy.
#Acute on chronic renal failure.
Did receive IV contrast for CT scan on this admission and was given pre- and post-hydration with sodium bicarbonate.
He was continued on his hydrea .
#Radiculopathy - continued GABAPENTIN renally adjusted and decreased to 300mg [**Hospital1 **].
#Granulomatous dz/Sarcoid - He was continued on his hydroxychloroquine.
He received stress dose steroids initially and was transitioned back to home dose prednisone.
Biopsy can be considered in the outpatient setting.
Coumadin was held initially then resumed.
He became supratherapeutic again and coumadin was held on [**2158-10-30**].
INR returned to 2.0, coumadin was resumed on [**11-1**].
Currently he is therapeutic on his home regimen of Coumadin 7.5mg and 10mg alternating daily.
Pt was instructed to continue this regimen upon discharge.
Pt was started on oxycodone and a lidocaine patch for pain.
Pt should f/u in rheumatology clinic as well as consideration of ortho clinic to consider need for local injection, physical therapy and/or need for surgical intervention.
He will need repeat chest imaging to monitor the CENTRILOBULAR RML OPACITY seen on CT scan (seen on prior imaging as well).
