Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year-old M with multiple medical problems including prostate cancer, dCHF, CAD s/p stents, PAD, COPD who presented with fever and hypotension concerning for early sepsis.
He was initially admitted to the ICU, where blood pressure remained stable after 3L of IVF in the ED without the use of pressors.
He received 3L of IVF in the ED, and on arrival to the ICU pressures were stable with SBPs > 100.
He was begun on vancomycin and cefepime for emperic coverage of suspected infection (HOD1).
The vancomycin was continued until blood cultures were negative for 48 hrs, and was discontinued on HOD4.
- recommend continuing PO vancomycin to finish 14 day course (last day of treatment [**2172-4-12**]) - recommend C. Diff precautions - recommend serial abdominal exams and standing aggressive bowel regimen .
#) Hypoxia: Review of records in OMR reveal PFTs with obstructive pattern consistent with emphysema in [**2164**].
Patient was not aware of this diagnosis nor is he on medications at home for COPD, so it seems that prior symptoms have been mild.
Given wheezing on exam, he received albuterol and ipratropium nebs PRN.
He was restarted on his home lasix therapy since it had been held since admission given hypotension.
He was also converted to standing ipratroprium/albuterol nebs.
On HOD10 the patient reported return to his baseline, and he no longer required supplemental O2 during the days.
- Recommend continuing albuterol and ipratropium nebs PRN for wheezing or shortness of breath .
The patient's home lasix was stopped in the MICU due to hypotension, and his creatinine trended down to 1.5 by HOD3.
Due to worsening peripheral edema, crackles on exam, and increasing O2 requirement, lasix was restarted on HOD3.
It was felt that the pt was hypovolumic given bland sedement and low FeUrea.
He was transfused 2 units of pRBC (HOD12-13) given his need for intravascular volume and pre-existing baseline anemia.
Lasix was initially held in the setting of fluid rescusitation and fever, as patient appeared dry on exam.
Lasix was restarted on HOD3 at 40mg PO given worsening peripheral edema, crackles, and increase in O2 requirement.
He was given 2 units of pRBC HOD13-14 for ARF on CKD and tolerated the additional volume well.
- Recommend continuing home dose of lasix after discharge.
He is not on any meds for rhythm or rate control at baseline at this time, though per family he may have been on rate-control agents in the past.
He was continued on aspirin and Plavix and monitored on telemetry while in the ICU.
- Consider beta blocker as an outpatient for rate control if needed .
He was continued on aspirin and Plavix during this admission.
