CXR [**2173-8-4**]: successful placement of right subclavian venous access device.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known firstname 4884**] [**Known lastname 6164**] is a 70-year-old man with Multiple Myeloma and plasma cell leukemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, DM type 2, who presents with fever and neutropenia.
He had recently received outpatient chemotherapy with Velcade on [**2173-7-26**].
He was treated empirically with 1x Vancomycin, 1x Levaquin and 1x Cefepime.
On the floor, antibiotic coverage was changed to IV Cefepime to cover GI organisms and pseudomonas.
The patient remained febrile and therefore Acyclovir was added since the patient was recently admitted with disseminated zoster.
The patient still remained febrile and Vancomycin and Azithromycin were added as per ID consultation.
A RIJ central line was placed for better access.
Treatment was then initiated with IV Voriconazole and Caspofungin was discontinued.
Pulmonary evaluation was obtained to evaluate the possibility of doing a bronchoscopy for the purpose of getting a tissue diagnosis according to the recommendations of Infectious Diseases.
Pulmonary felt that treatment would be continued despite a negative biopsy and therefore the risk of undergoing such a procedure was considered too risky given his degree of neutropenia.
Since the patient was responding to treatment, Voriconazole was continued PO, Acyclovir was continued at prophylactic doses PO, Vancomycin was discontinued and Levaquin PO was added for a two week time course.
In addition, the patient was thought to have renal tubular acidosis either secondary to his multiple myeloma (proximal RTA) or due to chronic renal failure with a persistently low bicarbonate on previous admissions.
Once back on the floor, formal renal consultation was obtained for further evaluation and guidance in treatment.
No treatment was necessary since the patient's acid-base status improved on its own with treatment of his underlying disease.
# MM/plasma cell leukemia: The patient had been receiving chemotherapy up until this admission with the last dose given on [**2173-7-26**].
During his hospital stay no chemotherapy was given due to his complicated hospital course with persistent neutropenia.
A portocath was placed the day prior to discharge and the patient was advised to follow up in clinic for possible future treatments.
It is unlikely that he will be able to tolerate Velcade again and other treatments will have to be explored.
His last dose of chemotherapy was on [**7-26**].
Mr. [**Known lastname 6164**] received multiple transfusions of both platelets and pRBCs in order to maintain his counts.
No ASA or heparin was given while in hospital except for minimal amounts of heparin to flush central lines.
After stabilization the patient had a stable blood pressure and did not require any antihypertensive medications.
The patient did not require insulin and his glucose values where consistently within normal limits.
On the last two days of admission, finger sticks and insulin were discontinued.
