Admission Date:  [**2144-11-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-12-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-9-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**] Chief Complaint: CHF exacerbation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central Line placment Hemodialysis   History of Present Illness: 77-year-old male with history of DM Type II, CHF (last echo [**7-/2143**] with EF 20-30%, 1+ MR, 1+ AR, LAH), CAD s/p CABG [**2129**]/[**2132**] (unclear anatomy, not on file here), chronic LE edema, LE superficial ulcers, who presented with worsening dyspnea, increased abdominal girth x 2 days (baseline wt ~ 172 lbs => 176 on last check this week).
Per past notes, it has been difficult to achieve a balance between his Cr and fluid management (baseline Cr 3.0).
Of note, MIBI in [**3-/2143**] with ** reversible inferior defect **; never had LHC since CABG in [**2129**]/[**2132**].
With regard to LE cellulitis/chronic venous stasis, patient's venous stasis ulcers were worse, possibly infected.
CAD s/p CABG in [**2129**] and [**2132**].
Benign prostatic hypertrophy s/p TURP 8.
History of right shoulder surgery [**49**].
LABS on discharge: WBC 12.1 (improving), HCT 28.4 (received one unit of blood in dialysis after this lab value), PLT 356 Na 135, k 4.2, Cl 98, HCO3 25, BUN 51, Cr 4.6 INR 1.8 .
Followup non- contrast chest CT is recommended after treatment to confirm stability of these nodules.
Initial management was directed toward lowering his wedge pressure and further afterload reduction for resolution of his systolic heart failure.
In brief, his hospital admission involved unsuccessful diuresis on the general medical floor with bumex and zaroxolyn with nesiritide, with transfer to the coronary care unit for ultrafiltration.
FLOOR COURSE: Initially was restarted on digoxin and anti-hypertensives for afterload reduction in setting of acute decompensated heart failure.
Bumex 4 mg IV (his outpatient dose) was started, with poor diuresis, prompting addition of zaroxolyn for synergy.
He was transferred to the cardiology floor service for further management and addition of nesiritide, lasix drip, and diuril for maximal non-tailored catheter therapy.
Creatinine continued to increased on nesritide, and per nephrology service, nesiritide was discontinued, in favor of bumex and hydrochlorothiazide.
He was noted to have paroxysmal episodes of NSVT and AT; given the heart failure, he was started on PO amiodarone for rhythm control.
Digoxin was restarted, with lopressor and nitrate held for further blood pressure room for fluid removal and amiodarone.
Renal function continued to decline, with diuretic refractoriness, and he was transferred to the CCU on [**11-26**] for tailored therapy or CVVHF.
Lasix and zaroxolyn trial was attempted without success.
A HD line was placed in the right internal jugular vein on [**12-1**], and dialysis was initiated on [**12-2**], on transfer back to the floor.
Given concern for conduction delay, tissue doppler imaging echo was obtained, which disclosed a septal-to-posterior wall motion delay od 306 ms; however, biventricular pacing was deferred given his pituitary adenoma (and likely reimaging) and active lower extremity ulcerations.
Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**11-20**] disclosed new aortic stenosis (valve area 1.0, though calculated in setting of low-flow, low-gradient), 1+ MR, global LV hypokinesis, with ejection fraction 21%.
FLOOR COURSE: On the floor, he was continued on hemodialysis for goal removal 1-2 liters per run.
Digoxin was increased per renal (who discussed with his primary cardiologist, who felt that his digoxin level should be [**1-19**] for goal effect, per his past history).
Given his low ejection fraction, he was started on coumadin for a goal INR [**2-20**], and should have a repeat INR check within 3 days of discharge.
Ceftriaxone (initially started in CCU for presumed UTI) was converted to ciprofloxacin given persistently positive urinalysis, and repeat urine culture was sent (pending on dischage); patient will complete ciprofloxacin 3 day course and, on INR check, should have a repeat urinalysis.
Spironolactone, lisinopril, amiodarone were continued, and he was started on renagel and nephrocaps as he initiated hemodialysis.
