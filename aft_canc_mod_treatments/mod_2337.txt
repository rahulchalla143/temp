# FIDUCIAL PLACEMENT [**2168-4-19**] 1.
Two gold fiducial markers placed within liver mass as described above.
A double pigtail stent was removed using a rat tooth forceps.
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
The dilation was greater on the left than right intra-hepatic ductal system.
Impression: Previously placed plastic stents were removed Evidence of a previous sphincterotomy was noted in the major papilla.
Multiple balloon sweeps were performed and large amount of blood clots and blood was extracted.
Given tumor in the common hepatic duct and a double pig tail biliary stent was placed  # CTA CHEST [**2168-4-27**] 1.
Brief Hospital Course: 61M w/ HIV, Hep C cirrhosis, HCC with recent admission for CAP, presented with RUQ pain and increasing bilirubin with progression of HCC on imaging, s/p ERCP with stent placement on [**4-25**] resulting improvement in tbili.
Pt had placement of fiducial and completed [**2-6**] rounds of cyberknife treatment.
His respiratory status improved with chest PT, suctioning, standing nebs, acapella device and incentive spirometry.
At time of discharge, he was stable on 2 liters of supplemental oxygen via nasal canula with oxygen saturation maintaining in the mid 90s.
He continues to require BiPAP at night secondary to his myositis.
He was initially on vancomycin and then transitioned to Daptomycin.
He was treated with pain medications and his pain improved.
On MRCP, the patient's HCC lesion was enlarged and causing mass effect on his biliary system (the likely the etiology of his pain) so he underwent ERCP and is s/p stenting with resulting improvement in his LFTs and Tbili, despite lack of improvement in pain because the lesion was still large.
He was ultimately started on Imodium with improvement in his symptoms.
For his HAART, his dosing was confirmed with pharmacy given liver failure, thus, he was continued on Leviva, Zetia and Truvada  # Hep C cirrhosis c/b HCC: slight elevation in LFTs, which were normal in [**2168-3-6**].
# Inclusion body myositis: Pt has limited mobility at baseline and requires BiPAP nightly.
He was continued on prednisone with Bactrim prophylaxis.
TRANSITIONS IN CARE # Code Status: DNR/DNI # Contact: [**Name (NI) 5969**] [**Name (NI) 40593**], HCP and Partner, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 40594**] # ISSUES TO DISCUSS AT FOLLOW UP: During this hospitalization, pt expressed a desire to change code status to DNR/DNI and transition to hospice.
He would like to continue all medications at this time, but is aware that he has the option of discontinuing any or all of them.
He would like to forgo any further treatment for his HCC, but should he change his mind, he should have a repeat ERCP in 6 to 8 weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
