Admission Date:  [**2109-12-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2110-1-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2054-4-22**]     Sex:  F  Service:  BMT  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55-year-old female with a history of thyroid cancer, status post radioactive iodine therapy, who presented to her primary care physician several months ago with a history of easy bruisability.
She was started on a course of Levaquin and referred again to a hematologist and had an expedited bone marrow biopsy on [**2109-12-13**].
On [**2109-12-16**], she was given the likely diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia based on those bone marrow biopsy results.
She received iodine 121 in the past.
Status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for uterine fibroids.
Levaquin 500 mg p.o.
Synthroid 112 mcg p.o.
Benadryl 25 mg p.o.
ALT 18, AST 19, LDH 153, alkaline phosphatase 59, total bilirubin 0.2, direct bilirubin 0.1, magnesium 2.2, phosphorus 2.8, haptoglobin 233, total protein 6.7, albumin 4.1, uric acid 1.9, B12 419, folate 14.6.
The patient was initiated on induction chemotherapy including Idarubicin and ARA-C, Idarubicin for three days and ARA-C for seven days.
She presented with neutropenia and was maintained on neutropenic precautions for the entirety of her hospital stay.
She was anemic on admission and became thrombocytopenic shortly after the initiation of chemotherapy and required multiple transfusions throughout her hospital stay to address both her anemia and thrombocytopenia.
In total, she required nine units of packed red blood cells transfusion throughout her hospital stay and a total of ten bags of platelets for ongoing issues of thrombocytopenia, which did become refractory to transfusion later in her hospital course.
The patient tolerated induction chemotherapy well but subsequently developed febrile neutropenia and had a complicated course beyond that including extensive infectious disease workup with aggressive antibiotic coverage and subsequent development of respiratory failure in conjunction with high fevers and possible transfusion reaction resulting in capillary leak requiring Medical Intensive Care Unit stay for diuresis.
Shortly after the initiation of chemotherapy, the patient was monitored closely for tumor-lysis syndrome and was continued on Allopurinol for expected hyperuricemia, normal cytogenetics were noted on her initial bone marrow biopsy.
On [**2110-1-8**], the patient was initiated on Neupogen to address her ongoing neutropenia.
On [**2110-1-17**], bone marrow biopsy was done by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 410**] to assess the patient's response to chemotherapy course.
She was initially continued on a course of Levofloxacin for prophylaxis.
Cefepime and Vancomycin were added to her regimen at that time.
As fevers did recur, she was started on AmBisome for antifungal coverage.
On [**2110-1-4**], fevers to 103 persisted and Cefepime was changed to Aztreonam for broad coverage.
Her fevers markedly increased despite change in medication and her Aztreanam was changed to Meropenem for gram positive gram negative anaerobic coverage in addition to Vancomycin and AmBisome.
Infectious disease consultation was obtained at that time in addition to sputum cultures.
In addition to their initial recommendation for CT of the torso, they recommended altering her antibiotic course to include Vancomycin, Aztreonam and Flagyl.
Flagyl during her hospital course and discharged on a course of Vancomycin to address this likely possibility.
Vascular access - On [**2110-12-19**], right subclavian Hickman line was placed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from the surgical service.
Also on transition to the Intensive Care Unit on [**2110-1-7**], a right internal jugular central line was placed by the Intensive Care Unit team.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was started with a neutropenic diet and nutrition consultation was obtained.
She did require TPN for a short course during her hospital stay.
Endocrine - The patient was continued on Synthroid for history of hypothyroidism.
Gastrointestinal - The patient received antiemetics including Anzemet and Compazine early on in her hospital stay while receiving chemotherapy.
She was also continued on a proton pump inhibitor, Protonix, for prophylaxis.
Clostridium difficile infection was suspected given the marked antibiotic administration.
Stool studies did not support this diagnosis, however, and the patient was continued on Flagyl and then discharged on a course of Vancomycin p.o.
Dermatology - The patient developed a rash during her chemotherapy course, but [**2109-12-26**], the dermatology team was consulted.
They suggested that her morbilliform eruption most likely represented hypersensitivity reaction, possibly from chemotherapy or perhaps Levofloxacin.
On [**2109-12-29**], the rash worsened in the setting of the start of two additional antibiotics, Cefepime and Vancomycin.
Atarax and Benadryl were started at the time for treatment of suspected hypersensitivity reaction.
On [**2110-1-8**], the consultation service made further recommendations for Clobetasol for seven to ten days for ongoing rash and for Hydrocortisone 2.5% for the face, ears and other sensitive areas.
Prior to discharge, the patient had ongoing rash suspected to be related to Flagyl and therefore was transitioned to Vancomycin p.o.
The pulmonary service held on bronchoscopy at that time as would not change management and did entail risks in this thrombocytopenic patient.
Vancomycin 125 mg capsule, one capsule p.o.
Levothyroxine 112 mcg tablet, one tablet p.o.
Pantoprazole 40 mg one tablet p.o.
Acyclovir 400 mg p.o.
Peridex 15ml p.o.
Ativan 0.5 mg one tablet p.o.
RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP:  The patient was advised to keep her follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] on Tuesday, [**2110-1-21**], at 2:00 p.m. to discuss any medication changes and to discuss biopsy results.
The patient was discharged with VNA services to provide Hickman care and monitoring of her respiratory status and to monitor for fever and signs of infection.
