Left anterior pneumothorax with chest tube in the posterior costophrenic sulcus.
Status post right pelvic transplant kidney without evidence of hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection.
An ET tube is present, tip lies approximately 5 cm above the carina.
An NG tube is present -- the tip is not well delineated but appears to overlie the stomach.
Left subclavian central line tip overlies the proximal SVC.
No pneumothorax nor, basal left basal pleural tube in place.
CXR [**6-2**] PM: FINDINGS: The tip of left subclavian line ends at mid SVC.
Left chest tube have been removed.
Subclavian line tip lies at mid SVC.
Unchange left lung base opacity from small effusion and atelectasis   Brief Hospital Course: 57 y/o on Cellcept + Rapamune s/p renal transplant [**2181**] for PKD, HTN, HLD and polycythemia, who was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] in [**10/2187**] for presumed bacterial meningitis, who presented with fever and AMS and was found to have Enterococcal faecalis meningitis and bacteremia.
Severe Sepsis due to Enterococcus faecalis Meningitis and Bacteremia: He presented with AMS and sepsis from bacterial meningitis in the setting of immunosuppresion for his kidney transplant.
He was intubated, started on propofol and fentanyl drips, and a left subclavian line was placed.
Line placement was complicated by a pneumothorax, requiring chest tube placement.
He was initially treated with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, ampicillin, acyclovir and dexamethasone.
Several antibiotic changes were made throughout his ICU stay but he was ultimately treated with ampicillin and gentamicin.
Gentamicin levels were monitored carefully throughout his hospitalization.
Decision was made not to preform additional neurologic imaging to search for a possible menigeal focus of infection and instead treat with an erradicative regimen of extended antibiotics.
The Infectious Disease team recommended long-term antibiotic therapy with 2 total weeks of gentamicin dosed at 420 mg Q48H, ampacilin 2g IV Q4H for a total of 6 week course.
Patient was discharged home to complete antibiotics via home infusion company with Q48H gent/creatinine checks and Qweekly CBC/CHEM 7 checked for ampacilin duration with results faxed to the [**Hospital **] clinic.
His blood pressure improved with fluid administration and antibiotics.
He briefly required norepinephrine on [**2099-5-31**] for blood pressure support.
Subclavian Line Placement Complicated by Pneumothorax: His left subclavian line placement was complicated by a small pneumothorax.
A chest tube was subsequently placed and set to suction.
Following extubation, his chest tube was removed on [**6-2**], although a small pneumothorax remained.
Hypertension: Although initially hypotensive, he gradually became hypertensive after several days of treatment of his infection.
His home regimen of metoprolol tartrate 100 mg TID and lisinopril 15 mg daily were held upon presention.
With the gradual development of his hypertension, he was started on hydralazine 50 mg PO Q6H while he was intubated.
It was felt that his hypertension was in part due to agitation so he was switched from propofol to dexmedetomidine, with some improvement in his blood pressure.
Following extubation, metoprolol was restarted at 50 mg PO TID, changed to labetalol.
His lisinopril continued to be held given concerns for potential renal injury in setting of gentamicin administration.
PKD s/p Renal Transplant: He received a living donor renal transplant in [**2181**] and has been immune suppressed on Cellcept and Rapamune.
His Rapamune and Cellcept were held on admission as there was significantly more concern for complications from his infection than for rejection of his transplanted kidney.
His rapamycin was restarted on hospital day 2 but was adjusted by the transplant nephrology service, who followed him throughout admission.
Patient's rapamycin dose was increased to 2 mg daily while on reduced cellcept dosing with plan to reduce dose when reassed by transplant nephrology.
Lisinopril continued to be held to allow for full renal recovery.
Transitional Issues: - rapamycin dose increased to 2 mg daily - cellcept dose decreased to 250 mg twice daily - d/c'd home on gentamicin Q48H dosing and Q4H amp with survailence labs sent to the [**Hospital **] clinic - patient is a full code - lisinopril was held at the time discharge - would consider surgical evaluation for removal cystic kidneys as possible source of recurrent infections.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital **] Home Health Care  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY -Enteroccocus menigitis -enterococcus bacteremia -polycystic kidney disease status post renal transplant  SECONDARY: -hypertension -hypercholesterolemia -polycythemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were intubated and sedated for several days.
You were treated with IV antibiotics with good effect, and your infection rapidly cleared.
You will need to continue IV antibiotics for additional 5 weeks.
You have a long-term IV line placed to allow for this therapy; it will be removed when your treatment is complete.
You will receive IV antibiotics at home through a visiting IV medication company that will also draw weekly labs that will be sent to our infectious disease experts.
We made the following changes to your medications: - STOP lisinopril until you have completed IV antibiotics - STOP metoprolol - START labetalol 200 mg three times a day, a drug related to metoprolol - START ampacillin 2 g IV every 4 hours for 5 additional weeks - START Gentamicin 420 mg every 48 hours for 1 week - REDUCE your dose of CellCept to 250 mg twice daily until you have completed IV antibiotics - INCREASE your sirolimus to 2 mg daily from 1 mg daily  Please follow-up with your physicians as listed below.
