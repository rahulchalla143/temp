Patient is currently getting chemotherapy for peritoneal cancer.
A chest X-ray confirmed the presence of a large pleural effusion and there was a question of an infiltrate and so the patient was given vanc/cefepime to cover HAP.
She was also given morphine 2mg and zofran 4mg for pain.
On [**2167-12-23**] she underwent a thoracoscopy with pleurodesis, biopsy of the left parietal pleura and right percutaneous drainage of pleural effusion.
She started carboplatin and paclitaxel on [**2167-12-31**].
After 3 cycles, she underwent surgical debulking and TAH/BSO by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2028**] on [**2168-3-31**].
She received 3 additional cycles of carboplatin/taxol post-operatively, last treatment on [**2168-6-15**].
CT torso in [**6-3**] was notable for a right sided pleural effusion which was malignant based on cytology from thoracentesis on [**2169-7-28**].
She started carboplatin/taxol again on [**2169-8-17**].
She had recurrent pleural effusion and underwent thoracentesis on [**2169-9-14**] and again in [**12-6**].
She was given a chemotherapy break.
Navelbine was dose reduced to 25mg/m2 during her second cycle, but she again became neutropenic and the D15 dose was held.
Her regimen was changed to Navelbine 30mg/m2 on D1 and D15 of a 28 day cycle and each dose is being followed with neulasta.
Patient started gemcitabine C1 D1 on [**2171-10-3**].
She completed 4 cycles of gemcitabine until having her dose held on [**2172-1-23**] due to concern of either progression of disease or gemcitabine pulmonary toxicity causing.
On [**2172-2-11**], patient began external beam radiotherapy to a dose of 3000 cGy in 10 fractions.

Interval increase in the pleural effusions bilaterally.
IVC Placement [**2172-6-8**]: HISTORY: Peritoneal cancer with pulmonary embolus and slow GI bleed for IVC filter placement.
PHYSICIANS: Procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 805**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 13414**] [**Name (STitle) 13415**], and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9441**].
PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure were explained to the patient and written informed consent was obtained.
Her right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
A preprocedure timeout and huddle were performed per standard [**Hospital1 18**] protocol.
Based on these diagnostic findings, a decision was made to place an infrarenal OptEase IVC filter.
The [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire was placed through the catheter and the catheter removed.
The sheath was removed and hemostasis achieved with digital compression for 10 minutes.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications.
Successful infrarenal placement of an OptEase IVC filter via the right common femoral venous access approach.
KUB [**2172-6-12**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction or ileus.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 year old F with poorly differentiated primary peritoneal adenocarcimona who is s/p multiple treatment modalities and who presented on [**2172-5-26**] with SOB and cough for 5 days that subsequently improved with pericardiocentesis.
Her hospital course, which now spans nearly one month, has had multiple complications, including bilateral PEs, now s/p IVC stent, Afib with RVR, gastrointestinal bleed, slowly resolving partial bowel obstruction, acute kidney injury, and complicated UTI.
On CTA  ([**6-2**]) the patient was found to have bilateral segmental PE's, as a result heparin drip was started after testing stool guiac which was negative.
IVC stent was subsequently placed without any complications.
Heparin was stopped in the setting of guaiac positive stool.
ASA 81mg was started for anticoagulation prophylaxis.
# GI bleed: Downtrending Hct in the setting of blood clots following an enema were concerning for GI bleed.
GI was consulted, who recommended that heparin be discontinued and that no further anticoagulation be given.
Aspirin was started for anticoagulation in the setting of Afib as recommended by Cardiology.
She was effectively rate controlled with IV lopressor pushes.
She subsequently had several more episodes of Afib with RVR that were precipitated by sitting up and moving to the cammode; she responded to lopressor pushes.
She was started on PO metoprolol tartrate, which was titrated to 50mg [**Hospital1 **] based on the recommendations of a cardiology consult.
Cardiology diagnosed her arrhythmia as asymptomatic episodic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, requiring no intervention with antiarrhythmic medications because she spontaneously converts on her own and only gentle rate control.
Due to repeated episodes of asymptomatic tachycardia due to afib, she was taken off of telemetry monitoring per cardiology.
# Partial bowel obstruction: Over the course of the hospitalization, she developed a partial bowel obstruction - presenting with a tense, tender abdomen, abdominal pain, and nausea.
She was made NPO and her diet was gently advanced to clears.
She continues to tolerate a conservative full clear liquid diet without any abdominal pain or nausea.
Started and currently continuing Vancomycin as a precaution ([**6-4**]).
We took another blood sample from her port on [**6-4**], to reassess.
Subsequent cultures were negative and antibiotics were discontinued.
She was treated with Cipro and sent home with 1 day of antibiotics for a total course of 10 days.
Was decided during this admission that further treatment would be with palliative intent.

To prevent further clots, you were started on an anticoagulation medication, but at a low dose because blood clots observed in your rectum raised concern for gastrointestinal bleeding.
This procedure was successfully completed and the decision was made to stop the anticoagulation medication and to start a conservative, safe dose of aspirin in its place.
The episodes were controlled with a medication that slows the heart rate to safe levels known as metoprolol.
Given this diagnosis and that you experienced no symptoms from the rhythm, we stopped 24h monitoring of your heart based on the recommendations of our cardiac colleagues.
Aggressive bowel regimens were given to you by mouth and per rectum with mixed success.
In addition, you had several episodes of abdominal pain without associated nausea, which were partially relieved with IV and oral morphine.
After these episodes, we made your diet order nothing per mouth (NPO) and slowly advanced your nutrition as tolerated.
We were very conservative in advancing your diet because you have not had a sizable bowel movement for some time now; you will be discharged on an agressive bowel regimen by mouth and per rectum and on a full liquid diet.
During this hospitalization, your kidneys showed temporary signs of dehydration, but this resolved with intravenous fluid.
You were also found to have a suspected urinary tract infection, which was treated with oral antibiotics.
