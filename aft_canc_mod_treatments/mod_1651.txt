Left PIC catheter tip ends just before the junction with the right brachiocephalic vein.
Pain became intolerable despite oxycodone and tramadol and pt was brought by family to ED.
She was started empirically by the floor team on vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl for the PNA.
The patient did not require intubation while in the ICU.
# Sepsis: Patient with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxia consistent with SIRS and likely source her MF PNA.
We continued his antibiotics as above.
Tobramycin peak and trough were ordered for her next dose on the floor as this was requested by pharmacy.
Patient may also be impacted given stool in rectum.
The output drastically reduced over 3 days, and we also prescribed a very aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, lactulose PR.
# Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia in setting of fever, right knee pain, and PE.
We have been treating fever with Tylenol PO/PR.
Finally, she is still deciding on an IVC filter as above for possible future PE.
There is ongoing discussion currently regarding possible treatment of her MDS.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] is following, and has been speaking with her regarding her IVC filter as well.
ideally, her counts will recover and there will be a possibility of restarting anticoagulation for her clots.
We have had to transfuse her on the unit (transfusion threshold of Hct of 21) and received platelets x 1 for a PICC line placement, but our threshold is 20. .
NG tube was removed and diet advanced.
For multifocal pneumonia, pt was on vancomycin, cefepime, and tobramycin (planning for 10 day course); tobramycin d/c'ed on [**7-17**].
MICU team spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] who wanted a permanent IVC filter placed instead of anticoagulation due to her thrombocytopenia and risk of bleeding.
Lovenox was stopped, and Procrit was started.
She was given platelets for PICC line placement and has been receiving them regularly along with pRBC as needed.
Pt continued to spike low grade fevers in the evenings which were controlled with tylenol but no infectious source could be identified; may be related to MDS.
Pt also had diarrhea after agressive treatment of her ileus but this improved with time and pt was C diff negative x3.
and final repeat C diff was negative.
