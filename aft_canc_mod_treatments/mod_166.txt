PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam, temperature was 97.4, blood pressure 145/102, heart rate was 79, respiratory rate was 21, and sats were 93% on room air.
His blood pressure was kept under 140 with IV Nipride.
Postprocedure, he had a ventriculostomy placed for hydrocephalus and a III cranial nerve palsy, which he developed suddenly during a postprocedure CAT scan.
The cranial nerve palsy resolved once the vent drain was placed, and he remained in the ICU being monitored for vasospasm for two weeks' time, where he remained neurologically stable, awake, alert, and oriented times three, moving all extremities with no drift.
Third nerve palsy was on the left and resolved with vent drain placement.
He had been getting covered with Levaquin and Kefzol that was changed to Vancomycin on [**2200-11-10**].
He had difficulty with hyponatremia and was on a 3% saline drip for several days.
His hyponatremia did eventually resolve, and he was just receiving salt tablets.
On [**2200-11-11**], vent drain was raised to 20 cm above the tragus, however, the patient had severe headache and hypertension.
The patient's vent drain was finally D/C'd on [**2200-11-19**] and a repeat head CT the following morning showed no evidence of hydrocephalus.
