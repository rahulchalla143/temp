Deformity of the adjacent fibula is seen with substantial resorption at its proximal aspect.
He was treated with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime starting [**2171-7-10**] and will continue until follow up appointment with infectious disease on [**2171-8-1**].
At that point it will be determined if IV antibiotics can be stopped and whether oral suppressive antibiotics need to be started.
PICC line was placed [**2171-7-17**] and can be removed once IV antibiotics are finished.
Once IV antibiotics are finished, he will start on oral suppressive antibiotics for chronic osteomyelitis.
Note 1/2 blood cultures grew Staph coag negative (sensitive to oxacillin and tetracycline), presumed to be a contaminant rather than actual bacteremia.
Echocardiogram was deferred due to lack of suspicion for endocarditis and MRI leg was not pursued due to clinical improvement on antibiotics and patient resistance to surgical debridement.
His chronic non-healing ulcer/chronic osteomyelitis of his left lower extremity is stable in size and without exudate.
Note weekly labs should be checked including CBC with diff, chem 7, vanco trough and LFTs and faxed to infectious disease.
