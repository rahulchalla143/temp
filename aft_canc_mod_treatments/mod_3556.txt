Status post left carotid endarterectomy with soft tissue changes and without evidence of a flow-limiting stenosis in the major neck vessels.
Thrombus in the right proximal subclavian artery.
MRI-HEAD [**6-7**] IMPRESSION: Two small foci of bright diffusion signal abnormalities in the left frontal cortex and left centrum semiovale associated with FLAIR signal changes likely to suggest recent infarcts without convincing ADC abnormality.
The patient had been started on heparin drip empirically by [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] service.
It was therefore recommended to keep her blood pressure well controlled (SBP<160) and stop the heparin drip given risk of edema and hemorrhage.
She was started on heparin drip again for concern of L CCA plaque.
She was immediately bolused with 2L IVF and then started on neosynephrine to keep MAP >90-100.
She improved with these interventions.
MRI showed watershed infarct in the L MCA-PCA borderzone and internal borderzone superiorly.
She was continued on heparin drip, with plan to transition to coumadin, but this plan was aborted due to falling hematocrit on [**6-11**].
She was seen by PT who recommended inpatient rehabilitation.
She received 1 U PRBCs on [**6-10**].
HCT repeated after transfusion was unchanged, and HCT continued to drop over the next 12 hours.
Heparin was transitioned to Argotroban.
However, she developed a rash and this medication was stopped.
She was also briefly started on lepirudin, but another rash led to discontinuing these medications as well.
Patient was started on Protonix drip empirically which was transitioned to IV push [**Hospital1 **].
She then underwent upper and lower endoscopy which revealed "A few small angioectasias with stigmata of recent bleeding seen in the second part of the duodenum.
After colonoscopy, she remained on aspirin (despite recommendations from GI post-procedure), although she was not started on other anticoagulants.
