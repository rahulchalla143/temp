His recent abdominal pain and nausea had improved over the previous days since he had been switched from Tacrolimus to Cyclosporine.
In the ambulance, he received nitroglycerin x 2 and Lasix 40 mg.  On arrival BP 200/90, RR 30, SpO2 78% on RA.
He was intubated and was treated with ASA 325 mg, levofloxacin 750 mg, rocephin 1 gram.
It was felt that he went flashed with fluid resuscitation, and he was started on a nitroglycerin drip.
He was sedated and paralyzed with succinyl choline and propofol.
Nitroglycerine gtt was discontinued.
He received Tylenol 1000 mg PR, 2 mg IV dexamethasone, Vanc 1 gram, and Zosyn 2.25 gram.
- Received induction chemotherapy with 7 + 3(ARA-C and idarubicin)-[**2182-7-23**] until [**2182-8-22**].
- Pt found to have relapsing dz and reinduced with Mitoxantrone and Ara-C [**Date range (1) 39624**].
Pt was found to have relapsing dz on bone marrow bx [**2183-9-2**] with 16% blasts, then was admitted between [**Date range (1) 39625**] for Mitoxantrone, Etopiside and Cytarabine.
- s/p myeloablative sequential unrelated double cord blood transplant, now D+120.
Day 100 bone marrow biopsy showed no diagnostic morphologic features of involvement by acute leukemia, with cytogenetics revealing karyotype 46XX, consistent with that of female donor.
2) hepatic insufficiency due to secondary hemochromatosis and steatosis 3) Aspergillosis of the sinus/nares initially maintained on anidulafungin after being on posaconazole for several months in an effort to "rest" his liver.
He has remained on voriconazole.
4) Bacillary angiomatosis 5) Acute appendicitis deep into his nadir during transplant that was successfully treated with daptomycin, meropenem, levofloxain and metronidazole 6) Incidental HHV6 IgG-positive, without disease 7) Cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology.
The patient underwent a cardiac MRI in [**7-/2182**] prior to chemotherapy and was noted to have an ejection fraction of 45%-50%.
8) Sarcoid - diagnosed in [**2172**], received intermittent steroids 9) GERD 10) HTN 11) Hypercholesterolemia 12) s/p cholecystectomy in [**6-/2180**] complicated by sinus tract to the abdominal wall 13) Hepatic and splenic microabscesses ([**8-/2182**])  Social History: The patient is married and lives with his wife [**Name (NI) 2048**] in [**Location (un) 620**], [**State 350**].
His father has hypertension, a h/o CAD status post three-vessel CABG, and sarcoidosis.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2184-4-16**] 11:11 AM FINDINGS: Diffuse lung parenchymal abnormalities have progressed, including areas of consolidation, ground-glass attenuation, and poorly defined nodules.
Bilateral hilar nodes appear similar allowing for difficulty in measurement due to absence of intravenous contrast.
Please note that absence of intravenous and oral contrast reduced sensitivity of CT for detecting abdominal abnormalities.
This could potentially represent a sebaceous cyst, but correlation with physical exam findings is suggested for initial further assessment if the diagnosis is not already known clinically.
Improvement of the widespread lung parenchymal abnormalities including ground-glass opacities, peribronchovascular infiltrates, and subpleural consolidation.

The dipyridamole was reversed with 125 mg of aminophylline IV.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 yo male with history of AML, s/p cord blood transplant who presented in early [**Month (only) 958**] with ARDS of unclear etiology requiring intubation.
Hospital course by problem:  # ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME: Upon admission, the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotic treatment in order to treat an infectious process responsible for a clinical picture consistent with ARDS.
Antibiotics included vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, as well as bactrim and voriconozole.
The patient was followed by infectious disease during this course, with coverage of antibiotics eventually being changed to vanc/meropenem/levofloxacin/flagyl as well as prophylactic doses of voriconozole and atovaquone.
Patient remained intubated from [**2184-3-18**] to [**2184-3-30**].
Patient was difficult to wean from the vent, possibly due to a VAP, but process was facilitated through continued diuresis and adjustments in antibiotics.
Prior to transfer to the medical floor vancomycin and cefepime had been discontinued.
He completed an empiric course of levaquin on [**4-8**].
He was volume overloaded on transfer and diuresis was continued with 100mg IV lasix daily.
On [**4-3**] the patient briefly desated to 88% on 6L NC and required NRB, occurred in the setting of [**10-22**] chest pain.
The patient was given additional diuresis, morphine and sl ntg and recovered to previous O2 requirement of 6L.
Cefepime (d/c'd on [**4-10**]) and azithromycin (d/c'd on [**4-12**]) were added for empiric coverage of hospital-acquired pneumonia.
He was switched to levofloxacin on [**4-11**].
On the morning of [**4-13**], the patient became hypoxic to 86% and required NRB to maintain sats in the low-mid 90s.
He received lasix 80mg IV, atrovent neb, SLN and was transferred to the unit.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended maximizing medical management given the context of pt's AML.
Pt was therefore placed on metoprolol titrated to maintain HR in the 70s, as well as ASA 81mg QOD.
Pt also responded well to furosemide IV diuresis.
CT chest revealed likely BOOP, and pt was started on methylprednisolone IV with planned slow taper.
He tolerated the taper well, and was weaned eventually to 1-2L O2.
He was transitioned to prednisone and discharged on 20mg prednisone po BID, which he should continue for 2 weeks until he follows up with his pulmonologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4507**].
He should continue the atrovent/spiriva and prn albuterol nebs.
Cardiology felt impression most consistent with angina and recommended continuation of aspirin and beta-blocker.
Had been poorly tolerant of beta-blockade thought secondary to sleep disordered breathing, dose was decreased to 100mg TID.
He was continued on ASA qod given thrombocytopenia and Metoprolol 75mg TID (adjust as needed) given episode of facial weakness/numbness thought to be [**2-14**] to relative hypotension.
Addition of statin/acei can be discussed as an outpatient.
Most likely was due to poor perfusion in setting of relative hypotension (SBP upper 90's).
Given concern that the fevers may be medication related, antibiotics have been systemacilly discontinued.
The meropenem was d/c'd on [**3-30**], and the vanc and flagyl were stopped on [**3-31**].
His levaquin was discontinued on [**4-4**].
He defervesced and his respiratory status improved with treatment BOOP as above.
# H/O LEUKEMIA, ACUTE s/p cord blood transplantation for AML.
Patient was admitted with supertherapeutic levels.
The patient was started on tacrolimus on [**3-31**] and then was held in the ICU.
He was continued on prophylactic regimen of voriconozole, atovaquone, and acylovir.
He was grossly fluid overloaded due to aggressive fluid hydration with oliguria, and has required diuresis to help mobilize fluid.
After aggressive diuresis on the regular medical floor, his creatinine again increased to a peak of 1.7.
Urine electrolytes were consistent with a pre-renal etiology and creatinine improved after diuresis was held.
