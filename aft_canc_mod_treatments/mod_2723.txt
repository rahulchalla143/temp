Prior to his presentation, he had been at a [**Hospital1 1501**] receiving Vanc and Zosyn since [**7-28**] for pneumonia.
Labs were significant for wbc 22k, Hct 10, K 6.0, Bicarb 10, INR 10 (felt secondary to coumadin in combination with antibitotics and amiodarone).
He was given 5 units PRBC's, 2 units FFP, and intubated for metabolic acidosis and airway protection in the setting of acute blood loss anemia and a GI bleed.
He was then transferred to the ICU for further management.
Pulmonary was consulted and performed a bronchoscopy, which revealed complete occlusion of the left mainstem bronchus, as well as secretions and mucus plugs in the right lung, which were cleaned out and sent for culture.
For his ongoing fevers, vancomycin and zosyn were continued for presumed post-obstructive pneumonia.
Stool cultures were positive for C. diff, so he was also started on PO Flagyl.
Apparently, the patient also had 1/2 blood cultures positive for VRE; however, this was believed to be a contaminent so linezolid was not started.
In addition to these issues, the patient also had an episode of rapid A fib which required IV lopressor and amiodarone.
The patient was transferred to the ICU at [**Hospital1 18**] for possible stenting of his left main stem bronchus.
He was given IVF NS bolus x 1 liter, but BP did not respond.
He was started on levophed and an a-line was placed.
Past Medical History: - Left lung squamous cell carcinoma: diagnosed in [**2184-10-15**]; s/p stenting to the left mainstem bronchus because of occulsion, as well as radiation therapy.
He was also recently started on chemotherapy (Tarceva).
- Post-obstructive pneumonia - A Fib (on coumadin): with several episodes of RVR, requiring cardioversion on one occasion.

Replaced vanco with linezolid, continued Zosyn and Flagyl.
Pt required Levophed to maintain MAP > 60. .
2) RESPIRATORY FAILURE: patient was intubated at OSH for airway protection and respiratory failure due to acidosis.
- Zosyn continued for ?post-obstructive pneumonia, will Linezolid started instead of vanco to cover resp organisms, as well as VRE bacteremia.
- PO flagyl continued for C. diff .
- all meds renally dosed .
7) A FIB: pt has h/o A fib with RVR requiring cardioversion in the past.
- Amiodarone 400 mg PO TID continued - lopressor, coumadin held since hypotensive and recent GIB .
9) FEN: was receiving TF's at OSH.
10) PPx: pneumoboots (no SC heparin given recent bleed), PPI.
All agreed that the patient clearly stated he did not want intubation and clearly expressed the desire for DNR/DNI.
Prevacid 30 mg IV b.i.d.
Lopressor 50 mg p.o.
Nystatin powder to groin.
Zosyn 2.25 gm IV q.8.
