Several rim-enhancing peritoneal implants are present in the right upper quadrant and midepigastrium (5:108, 5:99).
A second enlarged necrotic lymph node measures 3.1 x 2.7 cm.
A 5 x 8 cm hypoechoic mass is seen in segment I and a much larger mass is seen in segment VII and VIII which is difficult to measure with precision but is at least 10-11 cm in diameter.
Patient was given IV fluids to neutralize acid levels which caused swelling in his lower extremities.
ACTIVE #Metabolic Acidosis: Patient w recent pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis re-presenting with dyspnea; no signs of infectious pulmonary process on CT, UA; no PE on CTA; culture from recent thoracentesis remained without growth arguing against infected pleural effusion; imaging notable for marked progression of tumor burden; respiratory findings were thought to be compensatory for severe metabolic acidosis [**2-3**] type B (non-ischemic) lactic acidosis.
Patient was treated with IV bicarbonate with improvement in respiratory status.
Lovenox was held given elevated INR .
# SIADH: Patient with SIADH on prior admissions, w Na 126 on this admisison (up from 122 on prior admission).

# DM: Conservative sliding scale insulin given episode of hypoglycemia .

After a long discussion, you decided that you wanted to go home and not pursue further interventions for your cancer.
We arranged for you to have home oxygen and hospice services.
There were no changes to your home medications from before.
We did add a prescription for Trazadone 75mg every night to help you sleep.
The hospice will provide all other medications and services to make your time at home as comfortable and easy as possible.
