He does have HIV with CD4 count 460, VL 1728 per last d/c summary and is also on chronic steriods, had been on bactrim ppx but this was discontinued yesterday, however PCP is still be in the differential.
Pt was given antibiotic coverage for HCAP and aspiration with vanc/meropenem given PCN allergy.
PT also received standing nebs and prn nebs for SOB.
Initially, we increased steroids to solumedrol 60mg Q8h x 24 hours and then transitioned to prednisone high dose for 3 days, and then back to home dose 15mg qd.
# Abdominal pain: Patient reported RUQ pain at [**Hospital1 **] night prior to admission, which felt similar to prior "gall bladder pain" for which he received 1 dose of morphine with improvement in his pain.
Did have some hemobilia during the procedure which resolved.
In that case, patient will need percutaneous biliary drain placement for decompression.
# S/P hip fracture: Patient was on therapeutic dose Lovenox on admission in the setting of recent hip fracture and ORIF.
As pt was at risk for bleed, he was transitioned to heparin drip transiently instead.
This was complete and thus anticoagulation was discontinued.
Appeared dry on exam so there was likely a component of hypovolemia, additionally since he is on chronic steroids and currently stressed could be adreanl insufficiency.
We increased steroids as above, and gave IV normal saline with normalization of serum Na.
Pt was continued on truvada and fosamprenavir.
We increased steroids as above, and pt was continued on bactrim for ppx.
# S/P hip fracture: PT received enoxaparin 30mg [**Hospital1 **] for DVT ppx, acetaminophen and lidocaine patch for pain control .
We continued fluoxetine 60mg daily.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -full code -continue Vancomycin/Meropenem, last day [**2168-2-14**] -check LFTs every other day x1 week, then every 2 weeks; if RUQ pain or LFTs consistently trending up, will likely need percutaneous biliary drain -Repeat ERCP in 3 months -Of note, imaging revealed a 7-mm cystic lesion in the tail of the pancreas likely represents a side branch IPMN and is unchanged when compared to prior imaging.
