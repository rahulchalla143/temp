Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 24302**] Healthcare  Discharge Diagnosis: Metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (pancreatic cancer) Brain fetastasis (cancer spread to the brain) Pleural effusion (fluid in your lung) Ascites (fluid in your abdomen) Seizures Urinary tract infection (bladder infection) Encephalopathy (loss of conciousness, altered mental status) DVT of right lower extremity (blood clot) Hypernatremia (high sodium) Diabetes (high sugar) Hypercalcemia (high calcium) Thrush (yeast infection of the mouth) Bipolar disorder Anemia (low red blood cells) Thrombocytopenia (low platelets) Disseminated intravascular coagulation (abnormal blood clotting)  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Unresponsive.
You were started on whole brain radiation therapy but were unable to continue due to a change in mentation (encephalopathy).
Levetiracetam (Keppra) was subsequently stopped.
No cause of the altered mental state was found despite extensive tests including CT, MRI, and spinal taps (lumbar puncture) and covering with antibiotics.
High calcium was treated with medications (calcitonin and pamidronate), high blood sugars treated with insulin, and high sodium treated with IV fluids.
You had fevers that were from a urinary tract infection that was treated with IV antibiotics.
You also were given an anti-fungal medication fluconazole for thrush, a fungal infection in the mouth.
Given your poor quality of life, mental status change, and lack of improvement, your health-care proxy [**Name (NI) **] made the decision with advice from your doctors and family to keep you comfortable and to stop having tests and any treatment not focused on comfort.
