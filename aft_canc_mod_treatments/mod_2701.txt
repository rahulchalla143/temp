He completed a course of antibiotics during his last admission.
Went to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] buffet with friends and felt ill upon returning, went to pine street for his pain meds but it was closed, so he walked to [**Hospital1 336**] ER where he got 10 units regular insulin and 1.5mg total of IV dilaudid for chronic pancreatitis symptoms.
Regarding his R forearm, he says he had redness and tenderness of R forearm at prior IV site, which was being treated with warm compressess and elevation on day of discharge.
He is candid in his conversation regarding possible line tampering on last admit and says he was 'flushing his line because he did not want the line to clot.'

CELLULITIS -presented with evidence of possible cellulitis at site of prior superficial thrombophlebitis.
received iv Unasyn at [**Hospital1 336**] ER.
He was switched to Augmentin to complete a course for cellulitis from prior site of superficial thrombophlebitis  2.
His sliding scale was adjusted and he was counselled again regarding diet and sliding scale usage with lantus.
Since he has likely received at least 2 months of therapy for an asymptomatic upper extremity thrombosis in the setting of an IV which is now removed, there is probably little if any additional benefit to continuing lmwh; therefore, will not continue on discharge.
CHRONIC PANCREATITIS -he complained of his usual pain on admission and requested Dilaudid since it was given at [**Hospital1 336**].
on my review of last admission orders, he did not receive Dilaudid for the past 10 days, and was not discharged on Dilaudid on his last two [**Hospital1 18**] admissions.
