Three-month chest CT followup is recommended after diuresis to distinguish nodular atelectasis from a true lung nodule.
The right PICC line is unchanged with tip in the right atrium.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo male with pmh of sCHF (EF 45%), DM, metastatic prostate cancer, htn, urinary incontinence s/p artificial sphincter, and chronic back pain s/p multiple surgeries presents with dsypnea and found to have post-obstructive ARF which improved following nephrostomy tube placement, complicated by acute LE DVT, GNR bactermia, and HAP.
Foley initially was placed with urine flow and some improvement in BUN & Cr.
[**Month/Year (2) 159**] took pt to OR to perform cystoscopy, but was unable to place ureteral stents.
Following this, IR successfully placed bilaterally percutaneous nephrostomy tubes.
The right tube began putting out ample urine, while the left tube was found to put out scant, bloody urine.
Two days after initial placement, IR repositioned the left tube.
Following PCN tube placement, the pt went through post-obstructive diuresis with largely resolved ARF, during which time his fluid deficit was replaced and electrolytes were closely monitored and repleted PRN.
# GNR bacteremia: The patient was found mid-way through his hospital course to have GNR in his urine from the left nephrostomy tube and in also in his blood.
Anticoagulation was deferred given the prcedures necessary to relieve his renal obstruction and also a previous history of difficult to control INR when on coumadin in the past.
IVC filter was ultimately placed by IR without complications.
He was started on Vanc/Zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia and Gram-negative coverage, given his hx of GNR bacteremia.
The pt remained afebrile following broad antibiotic coverage.
Dyspnea improved following diuresis, but pt experienced an acute decompensation on HD #8, during which time he was presumed to be in flash pulmonary edema, given large IVF replacement with his post-obstructive diuresis, or PE, given his known acute thrombus despite IVC filter placement.
# Anemia: Patient with a Hct of 23.9 on admission, baseline Hct ranges 26-30, likely due to decreased production given metastatic prostate cancer.
Received 1 unit of PRBC in the ED.
Following PCN tube placement, Hct dropped to 21.6, for which 2 units PRBCs were given.
Once renal obstruction was relieved, pt underwent post-obstructive diuresis during which time electrolytes were closely monitored and repleted as necessary.
# Altered mental status:  Patient was very sleepy and somewhat confused during hospitalization, likely due to combination of factors: uremia, hyponatremia, hypoglycemic episodes, and increased serum concentrations of home benzos and pain meds given compromised renal function.
Head CT demonstrated no evidence of hemorrhage or large mass, but did indicate small hypodensity at Sylvian fissure, and met could not be completely ruled out.
Pt continued on metoprolol, and lasix and ACEi were held given compromised kidney function.
However, following resolution of volume overload, lasix and ACEi were re-started.
He endorsed some SOB during tachycardic episodes, and episodes responded well to 5 mg IV lopressor pushes.
Additionally, metoprolol regimen was increased to 100 mg TID from 50 mg [**Hospital1 **], to which the pt responded well with decreased episodes of tachycardia.
# DM: Patient is on insulin as an outpatient, however given his hypoglycemic episode in the ED, his decreased PO intake due to his anorexia, and his impaired renal function, his lantus and sliding scale were diminished.
Upon improving kidney function, patient developed hyperglycemia during which time his insulin was titrated back up towards his home dose.
Given his altered mental status and ARF on admission, his home pain regimen was decreased his chronic home opiod regimen: morphine SR 60 mg tid (was on 100 mg tid) and oxycodone 30 mg po q4h prn (was on 60 mg q4h prn).
Uptitrated his regimen back to his home regimen once his renal failure improved.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -Acute renal failure secondary to obstruction from malignant peritoneal fibrosis -Deep venous thrombosis -E coli UTI and bacteremia -Hospital-acquired pneumonia -Acute on chronic systolic heart failure  Secondary: -Diabetes -Hypertension -Chronic back pain -Metastatic prostate cancer   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were seen in the hospital with acute renal failure due to obstruction of your ureters (the tubes that run from your kidneys to your bladder).
In order to relieve this obstruction, tubes were placed directly into both of your kidneys, and your acute renal failure has resolved following this procedure.
A filter was placed in a large vein, called the inferior vena cava (IVC), to prevent the blood clot from dislodging and ending up in a place such as your lungs.
You were not placed on anticoagulation given the on going bleeding from the nephrostomy tubes.
Finally, you were found to have a rapid heart rate occasionally, known as tachycardia, for which the doses on some of your home medications were adjusted.
This resolved with medications intended to pull the extra fluid off of your lungs.
Also while you were in the hospital, bacteria was found both in your blood and in your urine for which you were started on an antibiotic.
Finally, you were found on chest x-ray to have pneumonia in your left lung, for which we are treating you with two antibiotics given IV through your PICC line.
Your metoprolol was increased to 100 mg three times a day from your previous dose of 100 mg once each day.
Your lisinopril was decreased to 5 mg each day from your previous dose of 20 mg each day.
Your clonazepam and lorazepam were discontinued during your hospitalization.
Please contact your doctor or return to the emergency department in the case of: chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, decreased urine output from your nephrostomy tubes, confusion or feeling "foggy", or any concerns you may have.
If you need to change the appointment, please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8243**].Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] UNIT Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 164**] Date/Time:[**2136-3-7**] 10:00  You will need to followup with Interventional Radiology for replacement of your nephrostomy tubes in approximately 3 montsh.
