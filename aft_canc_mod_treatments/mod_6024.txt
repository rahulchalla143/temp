ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: Patient had an episode of laryngeal penetration with thin liquids.
TECHNIQUE: Axial imaging was performed from the thoracic inlet to the diaphragm following the uneventful administration of IV contrast.
Coronary artery calcifications are not changed in appearance.
He was treated with levofloxacin to complete a 10 day course.
He was kept NPO (he came in NPO, getting nutrition through G tube which was placed for his chemo/radiation for his cancer).
His symptoms improved and oxygenation remained stable.
He was given metoprolol (changed from his outpatient atenolol, short acting for titration) which was titrated up to 150 mg per tube TID.
Coumadin was also initiated after discussion with patient and cardiology.
Tentatively, we thought bridging anticoagulation with lovenox, started after his platelets increased, would be best in light of the need for future port placement.
Although this was felt likely due to his recent chemotherapy with carboplatin, his subcutaneous heparin was held and a HIT antibody was sent which was negative.
# Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Nasopharynx: Recently completed radiation course, chemo, changed from Cisplatin to Carboplatin.
He was treated with viscous lidocaine/maalox/benadryl PRN.
# Benign Hypertension:  Continued his outpatient medications, along with titration of nodal blocking agents as above.
