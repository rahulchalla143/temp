wires/VAC placement [**2175-6-9**] sternal plating and closure   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 62 yo F s/p CABGx2 [**2175-4-3**] (LIMA to diag, Vein to OM) which was complicated by a pseudomonal sternal wound infection.
At this time, she was started on vancomycin.
ID was consulted and recommended IV cipro in addition to the vancomycin.
Her [**4-13**] Chest CT w/o contrast showed up to a 6mm dehiscence of the upper sternum with a small, gas-containing retrosternal collection.
A wound vac placed but no further debridement was performed at that time.
She was discharged on [**4-20**] with a plan for 6 weeks of IV antibiotics.
She was seen in ID f/u on [**5-8**] at which time she continued to have a wound vac in place and due to persistently elevated inflammatory markers, it was decided to continue her abx until seen by Cardiothoracic Surgery on [**5-22**] at which time her wound vac was discontinued.
It was finally determined by ID that her IV vancomycin and PO cipro would be completed on [**5-29**].
She was seen today in the [**Hospital **] clinic on routine follow-up where she was noted to have "black/green drainage" requiring dressing changes twice daily.
She notes her sternal wound has been healing well despite the ongoing drainage.
At a scheduled visit to the [**Hospital **] clinic today a new area of drainage at the midpoint of the sternal wound was noted, raising concern for a recurrence of infection.
