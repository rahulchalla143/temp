CXR [**2170-7-1**]: A tracheostomy tube is present.
A right IJ line is present, tip over distal SVC.
An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.
He was electively intubated and EGD showed portal gastropathy and grade I varices.
Pt was extubated 2 days later but placed on BiPAP soon thereafter for reps distress.
He was emergently bronched following intubation for suspected aspiration and 250cc of bilious fluid was suctioned out.
It was thought that this aspiration the led to ARDS picture.
He was continued on Abx and then due to prolonged intubation along with impending liver transplant, patient was trach'ed on [**6-18**].
However, after a traumatic NGT placement leading to a likely aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia, pt was sedated and placed back on AC.
Pt was started on albumin and rifaxamin for hepatorenal syndrome.
He was also started on lactulose.
Transplant team followed for the entire course of the hospitalization but continued to feel that he was not a transplant candidate given his persistant hypotension and fever with no clear source, despite broad antibiotic/antifungal coverage.
This was conveyed to the family after which they decided to withdraw support and made Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 3225**].
He was started on an octreotide drip and IV PPI, with the octreotide gtt eventually weaned off given his stable hct.
It was banded and octreotide was again started.
Other etiologies of the elevated PTT, PT and thrombin time include amyloidosis and multiple myeloma.
His INR slowly trended down and was corrected with FFP as needed prior to procedures.
# Bacteremia - e.coli bacteremia from [**6-2**] blood cx, sensitive to ceftriaxone for which he received a 14 day course (completed [**6-16**]).
Sputum grew out 1+ GPC so vancomycin was started.
he was also started on levaquin per ID recs.
Following his traumatic NGT placement concerning for an aspiration event, he was rebroadened to cefepime/flagyl and vanc.
ID was following and recommended adding Caspofungin to his regimen to cover fungals.
Cardiology was consulted for pre-transplant evaluation and they recommended starting low dose beta blocker which pt did not tolerate with hypotension.
# ARF: On admission, pt's creatinine elevated to 2.7.
Over the next several days, pt was slowly diuresed with CVVHD and maintained on CVVHD until his BP stabilized.
He remained on CVVHD, however patient continued to become progressively more hypotensive over the course of the hospitalization and he was started on pressors once again to maintain MAPs >60.
#FEN: Patient was started on TPN for nutrition as he had a prolonged stay in the ICU.
Given his refractory hypotension, requiring pressors and his persistant fever despite very broad coverage he was deemed not be a transplant candidate.
After lengthy discussion with the family it was decided to make the patient [**Date Range 3225**] as his prognosis without a transplant was grim.
