Lastly, patient with Crohn's disease, and has had bleeding in the past, but none for many years, and disease activity has decreased since colectomy - not on any medications.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from surgery was consulted who feels that tumor site 15cm from ileostomy is source of bleeding associated with Evastin.
They recommended a push enteroscopy and ileoscopy with biopsy.
Given the stabilization of bleeding, pt wanted to go home to [**State 2748**], with plans to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a possible resection of the involved area of small bowel with intraoperative push enteroscopy to examine the rest of the small bowel.
