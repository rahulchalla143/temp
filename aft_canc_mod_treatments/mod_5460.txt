She was found to be hypertensive and intubated at the scene and resuscitated with IV fluid boluses.
Prior to this, the patient had neck swelling for 2 days which occurred in conjunction with administration of Actos for newly diagnosed diabetes.
She was transferred here for a planned sternotomy with mass resection.
It was recommended that total thyroidectomy be performed as well as thyroid hormone replacement initiated.
She was preopped for surgery on [**2173-4-12**].
The patient tolerated the procedure well from a hemodynamic standpoint.
However, attempts to re-intubate her at the end with assistance of  tube changer were unsuccessful using 8.0, 7.5, 7.0 and even a 6.5 endotracheal tube and it was presumed that the patient had an extrinsic mass or perhaps extrinsic pathology to the trachea.
She was returned to the OR on [**2173-4-14**] for rigid bronchoscopy and tumor debridement as well as dilation of tracheal stenosis.
At this time, it was noted that she had diffusely abnormal mucosa of her subglottic space and significantly narrow tracheal lumen down to the distal trachea.
Biopsies and therapeutic aspiration were performed.
At this time, a 6.5 ET tube was placed without difficulty.
She was transferred back to the ICU for further management.
ID was consulted and the patient was started on imipenem and tobramycin at this time.
The patient remained stable and on [**2173-4-16**], returned to the OR for bronchoscopy with tracheal dilation (balloon and rigid) with tracheostomy.
A right chest tube was placed as well as her central line was changed over wire and post chest tube chest x-ray showed marked improvement of the large right pneumothorax.
Unfortunately, the patient went into atrial flutter which responded to IV Lopressor.
At this time, given her stable, resolved pneumothorax, the chest tube was placed to water seal.
On [**2173-4-18**], her vent was weaned to CPAP and pressure support which the patient tolerated well.
Over the following day, the patient was diuresed and tolerated tracheostomy mask trials for 2-3 hour periods per day.
Endocrine was following and corrected the patient's hypocalcemia with Calcitriol as well as calcium carbonate.
Her blood sugars were stable and the patient was off the insulin drip at this point.
She was started on NPH and sliding scale insulin.
A small right-sided pneumothorax persisted with the right chest tube in place.
Her chest tube was removed and post pull chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumothorax.
At this point, the patient had been receiving tube feeds at goal via NG tube.
On [**2173-4-23**], a PICC line was placed and the central line was removed.
She was tolerating tracheostomy mask for 6 hours.
ENT felt that her ET tube was too big/long to phonate and cognitive issues were also preventing her from fully cooperating with the exam.
Discussions with interventional pulmonology were initiated regarding having a custom-made T tube made.
On [**2173-4-28**], a Dobhoff tube was placed and plans were made for a PEG to be placed the following week given the patient's failure to pass the swallow exam.
Over the next few days, the patient was stable and remained afebrile on Unasyn and amikacin.
She completed her antibiotic course on [**2173-5-1**].
She continued to tolerate her Dobhoff tube feeds.
On [**2173-5-3**], the patient returned to the OR for a flexible bronchoscopy for tracheal measurements as well as flexible EGD with insertion of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and returned to the recovery room in stable condition.
On [**5-4**], her tube feeds were resumed and increased to a goal of 50 cc per hour with fiber at full strength.
She tolerated her tube feeds well.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Papillary cancer with positive nodes status post sternotomy and partial right and total left thyroidectomy on [**2173-4-12**], status post rigid bronchoscopy and tumor debridement on [**2173-4-14**], status post open tracheostomy on [**2173-4-16**], status post bronchoscopy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement on [**2173-5-3**].

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  Interventional Pulmonology has ordered a custom T tube for the patient.
