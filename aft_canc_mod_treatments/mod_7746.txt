After this scan was performed, and the information obtained, she underwent a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 94542**] under the care of the Interventional Radiology Service.
This procedure confirmed the CT findings of markedly dilated bilateral hepatic ducts and common bile duct, with a high grade obstruction at the level of the distal common bile duct.
They successfully placed an #8 French internal and external biliary drain across that common bile duct lesion and placed her bag to drainage.
Given her CT angiogram with pancreatic protocol, showing that there was no evidence of anatomic unresectability, it was felt that the patient would benefit from percutaneous transhepatic catheter drainage and preoperative optimization for ultimate Whipple procedure.
Status post bilateral mastectomy.
Status post laparotomy and oophorectomy.
Serum chemistries notable for sodium of 132; potassium of 3.5; chloride 97; bicarbonate of 26; BUN and creatinine of 15 and 0.6 with a serum glucose of 264.
The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, after these initial diagnostic and therapeutic radiographic studies were performed, was notable for having a nutrition consult, getting supplemental nutrition enterally and parenterally.
All of these factors necessitated the patient to be intubated for airway protection and for ventilatory support.
A pulmonary artery catheter was inserted showing very low filling pressures in the setting of hyperdynamic physiology, confirming the likely suspicion that the patient was now septic.
There was a small amount of free air that was thought to be secondary to her PTC catheter insertion done back on the 22nd.
The patient was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics, including Zosyn and Fluconazole.
She was pan cultured and supported with Crystalloid effusion.
She had Vasopressor dependent shock, necessitating augmentation with Vasopressin and Levophed to maintain her mean arterial pressure greater than 60.
The patient was started on antifungal therapy for [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans which grew out from her bio clusters from [**2123-5-3**].
After a wash-out and exploration, it was determined that the patient had a serial and proximal pyloric blow-out.
Support was withdrawn and she was made comfort measures only.
