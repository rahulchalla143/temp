Admission Date:  [**2169-5-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2169-6-2**]   Service:  Neurosurgery/cardiac medicine HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 30097**] is a 79 year-old Russian male with history of renal cell carcinoma diagnosed in [**2166**], status post left nephrectomy in 2,000, status post IL2 therapy, with lung metastasis, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes who presented one year ago with an metastatic renal cell carcinoma in [**Month (only) 547**] of this year.
He was admitted on [**5-23**] for tumor embolization and left frontal parietal craniectomy with resection of the tumor and cranioplasty on the 13th.
On the evening of [**5-24**], however, the patient developed right arm Enzymes were cycled at that time and the patient ruled in for non-Q wave myocardial infarction with troponin peaking at greater than 50 and CK of 1,014 with an MB of 82.
The patient was started on intravenous Lopressor and  nitroglycerin.
The patient was then taken for cardiac catheterization which revealed three vessel disease with left main disease and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed prophylactically.
Patient underwent IL2 therapy beginning in [**Month (only) 956**] of 2,000 complicated by atrial fibrillation.
Patient underwent left nephrectomy in [**2168-5-12**].
MEDICATIONS (Outpatient):  1) Digoxin 0.25 mg q. day, 2) Atenolol 25 mg p.o.
TRANSFER MEDICATIONS:  1) Insulin sliding scale.
2) Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.
3) Nitroglycerin drip.
4) aspirin 325 mg q. day.
5) Captopril 25 mg t.i.d.
A balloon pump was placed in the right femoral vein.
Patient had pulmonary hypertension, moderate aortic stenosis, 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation and wall motion abnormality.
Cardiac catheterization on [**5-25**] showed left main disease with an ostial 38 or 40 percent, distal 90 percent, mid LAD lesion of 80 percent, diagonal of 100 percent, mid left circumflex of 90 percent with right to left collateral flow distally, RCA with 90 percent involving the PDA.
With the severity of his disease, decreased ejection fraction, and other co-morbid illnesses the patient was thought to be too high risk exceeding the possible benefit of bypass grafting.
The patient was initially maintained on intravenous nitroglycerin and intravenous heparin was discontinued after removal of intra-aortic balloon pump and intravenous nitroglycerin was weaned.
The patient was maintained on daily dose of aspirin and Lopressor was increased gradually to 100 mg t.i.d.
Given the patient's elevated left ventricular and diastolic pressure of 26 the patient was diuresed and later started on a daily dose of Lasix orally.
As for the patient's atrial fibrillation with the patient's increasing risk of falling anticoagulation was discussed wit the neurosurgery team who felt that it would be wise to hold off on restarting Coumadin postoperatively and to re-evaluate this in one month after the patient is back on his feet.
The patient's hematocrit stayed persistently between 28 and 30 while the intra-aortic balloon pump was in.
Patient was transfused several units of blood with inappropriate bumps after intra-aortic balloon pump was removed hematocrit climbed to the 33 and was stable for several days.
Heparin was discontinued and Zantac was changed to Prilosec.
Platelet count began to rise after the balloon pump was removed.
After discussion with neurosurgery these changes were considered normal for his postoperative course and the patient's strength was expected to improve.
The patient was maintained on a regular insulin sliding scale with fingerstick blood glucose checks.
The patient will likely benefit from daily doses of scheduled NPH and regular insulin.
Given the patient's chronic renal insufficiency creatinine was followed daily, especially when the intra-aortic balloon pump was in place.
The patient was eventually started on ciprofloxacin renally dosed for his creatinine clearance of a sterile pyuria.
For prophylaxis the patient was prophylaxed with heparin subcutaneously a well as pneumoboots and Prilosec p.o.
Status post tumor embolization and left         frontoparietal craniotomy with resection of tumor         and cranioplasty.
Resolving right sided lower extremity hemiparesis         secondary to postoperative surgical edema.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  1) Lopresor 150 mg p.o.
b.i.d., 2) Captopril 100 mg t.i.d., 3) Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
q. day, 4) Isordil 20 mg p.o.
t.i.d., 5) Lasix 20 mg p.o.
6) enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.
7) Colace 100 mg p.o.
8) Prilosec 20 mg q. day.
9) Heparin subcutaneously 5,000 units subcutaneously t.i.d.
10) Dulcolax 10 mg p.o./p.r.
11) sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual q.
12) regular insulin sliding scale 0 to 70 give D50 or juice, 71 to 160 give nothing, 161 to 200 give 2 units, 201 to 250 give 4 units, 251 to 300 give 6 units, 301 to 350 give 8 units, 351 to 400 give 10 units, greater than 401 give 12 units.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] note, the patient had a mildly elevated heart rate at discharge to rehabilitation in the 80s given his high dose of beta blocker.
