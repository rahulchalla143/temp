The patient was admitted to the MICU service for close monitoring and ventilatory support.
Thought to be multifactorial, including pneumonia, CHF, and COPD exacerbation.
The patient was treated with cefipime and vancomycin for a CAP vs nosocomial PNA.
Solumedrol was given for COPD, as well as albuterol/atrovent nebs.
A thoracentesis was performed on HD2 for the large R pleural effusion, with removal of approximately 700cc fluid which was consistent with a transudate, and negative for malignant cells.
The patient remained intubated with RSBI scores around 150 suggesting she was a poor candidate for extubation, although attempts were made to optimize the chances for her success by diuresis and controlling her heart rate and blood pressure, initially with labetalol gtt then PO labetalol.
The patient eventually did well with improved mechanics and was extubated on [**2164-1-21**] and has since maintained her SaO2 on 4 L NC.
Was scheduled for debulking surgery during previous admission which did not occur [**12-22**] colonic perforation.
Tests for c diff sent which were positive and started Flagyl for treatment.
The patient's blood pressure was initially difficult to control, requiring a labetalol gtt which was eventually transitioned to PO.
Tube feedings through J-tube.
The patient while on Tele on the floor was found to be agonal and bradycardic to the 30s without a palpable pulse; the patient was quickly intubated, CPR was intiated, and she received one dose of atropine with return of a palpable pulse and blood pressure.
An emergent femoral line was placed during the resuscitation; this was removed once a R subclavian line was placed under controlled circumstances in the MICU.
A L pleural effusionw as removed by thoracentesis at the bedside.
After discussion with the pt and the health care proxy, the patient underwent tracheostomy [**2164-1-27**].
The patient is currently on CPAP/PS 12, FIO2 40%, TV 360s, and will need to be weaned off ventilator as tolerated to trach mask.
For chronic obstructive lung disease, the patient has been tapered off steroid from 60mg qday now to 20mg qday.
The patient is to take prednisone 10mg x 3days and off steroid.
Renal u/s revealed new hematoma around her foley, so a three-way foley was placed and continuous bladder irrigation was done.
The patient still has a foley currently and needs to be removed at rehab as the patient has urinary tract infection that she is getting treated with Ciprofloxacin which she will complete on [**2-9**].
For C.diff, she has been getting Flagyl and will finish 10 day course on [**2164-2-3**].
The patient will need to follow-up with her oncologist for renal cell carcinoma and decide on the date for debulking procedure.
Suggest starting a PO diet of nectar thick liquids and pureed consistency solids when on Pressure support vent settings or less and with PMV in place.
Continue with tube feedings for supplemental nutrition  and hydration.
The patient developed delirium and suicidal ideation soon after tracheostomy and psych was consulted and started haldol 1mg [**Hospital1 **].
The patient's delirium has cleared since the initiation of haldol but still intermittently sundowns, so her mental status needs to be monitored and follow-up with her primary care physician and determine on whether to continue haldol or not.
For prophylaxis, the patient has been getting subcutaneous heparin, and until ambulatory, pt will likely need subcutaneous heparin given her high risk for DVT and PE due to her cancer.
