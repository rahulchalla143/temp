He was given 12mg of ativan and required intubation and mechanical ventilation.
He was loaded with dilantin and was admitted to the NICU.
He was started on Decadron 4mg IV q8h and maintained on dilantin 100mg tid.
He remained intubated until [**9-11**] when he was extubated without event.
He was restarted on Sirolimus on Iressa.
Dilantin was tapered to 100mg [**Hospital1 **] due to drug-drug interaction which lowers levels of chemotherapeutic agents.
He will need to be tapered off of dilantin in order to optimize his chemo treatment.
His family is requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 112**] for continued treatment and we have arranged for transfer to the [**Hospital1 112**] neurology service under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 24642**].
