Brief Hospital Course: 68 year old woman with h/o small cell lung cancer, diabetes type 2 on insulin presented with marked hyperglycemia.
The patient had a urinalysis with minimal bacteria and few WBC, but has been taking ciprofloxacin for approximately 9 days for a urinary tract infection.
Her CXR on [**3-30**] showed evidence of LLL pneumonia, unclear whether she had pneumonia at home which did not "blossom" until she received IVF in the hospital.
She was put on an insulin gtt with normalization of her serum glucose and anion gap.
At the time of discharge, her blood glucose was well controlled on insulin subq lantus + humalog sliding scale.
Presumably she had pneumonia prior to admission but it did not "blossom" until she received IVF in the hospital.
Patient was treated with azithromycin, and the plan is for a 5 day course (the last day [**4-3**]).
# UTI: The patient was continued on ciprofloxacin and this was discontinued on antibiotic day 9.
Patient was started to aspirin for stroke prevention.
# Hypertension: Metoprolol and captopril were continued.
# Hypothyroidism: Home dose levothyroxine was continued.
# Hyperlipidemia: Home dose statin was continued.
