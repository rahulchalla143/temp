He required hemodialysis and decided after a family meeting for home hospice care while continuing outpatient dialysis.
A tunnelled hemodialysis catheter was then placed.
Creatinine did not trend down after fluid challenge, suspicion for lymphomatous infiltration of the kidney was high.
Given progressive renal failure, acidosis, hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia, a HD catheter was placed and dialysis was initiated.
After deciding to continue dialysis indefinitely, a tunnelled catheter was placed.
He was treated with Kayexylate with K trending down to 5.0.
He was transfused to maintain HCT >21 and Platelets >10.
# Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma: Given "double hit" highgrade lymphoma with translocation of c-myc and Bcl-2, prognosis was grim and he had been on palliative chemotherapy.
After the discovery of lymphomatous involvment of the kidneys causing renal failure, he was offered experimental chemotherapy which he declined, preferring to focus on quality of life.
# Afib s/p cardioversion and HTN: Metoprolol had been held during previous admission for bradycardia to the 30s.
He was maintained on telemetry and bursts to ventricular rate of 130 were noted.
Metoprolol was resumed with improved rate control.
Given a recurrence of bradycardia, the metoprolol dose was minimized and furosemide, per Nephrology, was added for uncontrolled hypertension.
# Hx of PE: Diagnosed with PE in [**9-/2197**] and previously anticoagulated with fondaparinux, anticoagulation was stopped prior to admission for thrombocytopenia and not resumed.
