Orthopedics also consulted, and recommended that the patient be made NPO after midnight for a hip fracture repair.
Neurosurgery evaled and felt that she would benefit from Decadron 4 mg Q8H, but did not rquire seizure prophylaxis.
Past Medical History: -HTN -Type II diabetes -Hyperthyroid -Hyperlipidemia -tobacco abuse -s/p hysterectomy -s/p carpal tunnel release  Social History: -married, lives w/ children, three adult children -Smoker, since age 30, 1ppd (1/2ppd for last couple years) -former ETOH abuse, sober 17 years -denies drug use   Family History: -Denies any familial history of cancer   Physical Exam: VS: 98.2 128/63 64 18 95%RA General: Caucasian female in no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: S1, S2 regular rhythm, normal rate Abdomen: soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly, Ext: right lower extremity shortened, externally rotated, distal pulses intact Neuro: oriented x3, speech fluent, tongue midline, face symmetric, right lower extremity strength not assessed but moves toes, upper extremity strength grossly intact, mild right sided dysmetria on finger nose finger, gait not assessed.
CT HEAD: mass lesion within right cerebellar hemisphere with adjacent mass effect and compression of 4th ventricle.
[**12-21**] Brain MRI: Postoperative changes in the right cerebellum with hemorrhage in the operative bed precluding evaluation for residual neoplasm.
Brief Hospital Course: MEDICAL HOSPITAL COURSE:  #METASTATIC CARCINOMA: Initially presented with fall, found to have cerebellar lesion on CT head and multiple lung lesions on chest CT, so was thought to have primary lung lesion with mets.
Lung lesion biopsied with bronchoscopy on [**12-17**] and showed adenocarcinoma on pathology.
Heme/onc was consulted as well after tissue dx made, as well as rad onc.
Rad onc recommended radiation to cerebellum post-surgery (below) and heme/onc recommended outpatient PET scan and chemotherapy to start at least 6 weeks post-op.
Patient was followed by both neurosurgery and neuro-oncology services, and was treated with IV decadron 4 mg Q8H, transitioned to PO decadron on [**12-19**].
Did not recommend anti-epileptics or other interventions.
On [**12-20**], after tissue diagnosis of adenocarcinoma made, patient was taken to OR for resection of mass and hemicraniotomy and transferred to neurosurgical service.
Initially surgery was delayed for one day because of concerns for starting anticoagulation with lovenox in setting of cerebellar mass with risk of possible hemorrhage, also with discussion of possible shunt.
It was decided with orthopedics, neurosurgery and neuro-onc that an IVC filter would be appropriate for DVT prophylaxis considering risk for bleed.
Pt tolerated procedure without complications on [**12-14**], bone was biopsied for concern for pathologic fx, and pathology negative for malignancy.
