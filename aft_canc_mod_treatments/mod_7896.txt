Patient was treated with octreotide drip for 72 hours and [**Hospital1 **] iv pantoprazole.
Pt was given cipro 500mg [**Hospital1 **], with plan for 1 week course.
Pt was discharged with sulcralfate, nadolol, ciprofloxacin, and increased PPI.
Pt will need to have a repeat EGD at some point in the future to remove his duodenal polyp and will need LFTs to monitor his recover on pentoxifylline .
Pt was treated with pentoxifylline given discriminant function of 39.
Pt was given pentoxifylline instead of steroids because of the possible ulcer-related etiology of his bleed.
Lasix and spironolactone were held in the setting of the acute bleed but restarted without issue after his condition stabilized.
Pt became hypertensive up to the 170s after his lisinopril and metoprolol were held, but was normotensive in 130s after starting and increasing nadolol to 40mg po daily, which was continued at discharge.
#) Acute renal failure: most likely pre-renal from hypovolemia, resolved with transfusions and fluids.
Patient monitored on CIWA after extubation.
Pt's HR settled at ~100 after receiving diazepam 5-10mg q4hrs on CIWA scale > 10.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Pt was discharged w/ 1 month course of pentoxifylline will need LFTs to assess the degree of recovery.
-Pt's lisinopril and metoprolol were stopped in the setting of acute GI bleed and nadolol was started instead for varices.
His prior BP meds may need to be restarted if he becomes hypertensive.
