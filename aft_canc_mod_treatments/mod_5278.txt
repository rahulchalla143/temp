ONCOLOGIC HISTORY (from OMR): The patient was diagnosed with AML in [**9-22**] on routine blood work that showed pancytopenia, bone marrow biopsy showed myelodysplasia with no cytogenetic abnormalities, repeat bone marrow biopsy showed acute erythroleukemia admitted [**2-23**] for induction chemotherapy with 7+3 cytarabine and idarubicin, which she tolerated well, Day 14 bone marrow showed zero blasts, consistent with complete ablation.
She then underwent allogeneic transplantation from an HLA matched sibling donor with pentostatin/TBI in [**3-23**] c/b mild GVHD, skin (mouth [**12-23**]) and colon (preliminary colon bx suggestive of gvhd [**1-24**], however final diagnosis of no definitive diagnosis of graft-versus-host disease communicated after the case has been reviewed).
Tracing at 15:59:26 Sinus bradycardia at HR 51 bpm, Q waves in II (1mmx0.5mm), III, aVF, TWI in III aVF still with ~0.5-1mm STE.
Right sided leads without ischmic changes.
MYOCARDIAL ELEVATION, TRANSIENT ST ELEVATION The patinet was started on heparin in the ED after she developed transient ST elevations in inferior leads and lateral STD; initial cardiac enzymes were negative.
Biomarkers returned positive later (peak CK 1500, peak troponin 6.89 at 2p [**6-11**]), and she was started on integrilin and plavix loaded with 600mg PO x1.
4 stents were placed in the RCA.
Unclear what options remain for intervention should she develop in-stent thrombosis/restenosis or LAD occlusion; CABG may be an option.
Continued medical therapy with ASA, Plavix, statin, betablocker.
Patient was transitioned to toprol XL 25mg daily prior to discharge.
ANAPHYLACTOID/CONTRAST ALLERGY The patient developed an anaphylactoid reaction to IV contrast used during cardiac cath.
Prior to the procedure on [**2192-6-11**], she was started on fluids, diphenhydramine 50mg po, ranitidine 150mg po, methylprednisolone 125mg IV, and prednisone 40mg as pretreatment for a known iodidine allergy.
She received 150mL of Omnipaque and 220mL of Optiray during the procedure.
The evening of her procedure she developed generalized erythema.
She was treated with diphenhydramine 50mg po and continued on IVF.
She had a post-cath check at 9:40pm, at which time her VS included T 100.0, BP 110/53, and she was given an IVF bolus.
She was given diphenhydramine 50mg po, fexofenadine 60mg, and IV fluids.
SBPs persisted in the 70s, so she was given epinephrine 0.3mg x 2.
Allergy was consulted and felt an anaphylactoid to IV contrast was most consistent with the patient's known allergies; allergy recommended 125mg IV Solumedrol x3 days followed by a taper.
She was quickly titrated off dopamine and her blood pressures normalized.
The patient was also treated with standing diphenhydramine and ranitidine.
Upon discharge, the patient was prescribed prednisone 60 mg PO on [**6-16**] mg PO on [**6-17**] mg PO on [**6-18**] mg PO on [**6-19**] mg PO on [**6-20**], and from [**6-21**] and onward 10 mg daily until otherwise directed by her outpatient team.
