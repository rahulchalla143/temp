A thoracentesis was attempted, but there was insufficient fluid to tap.
On hospital day 3 he triggered for O2 sat of 86% on 4L nasal canula and was increased to 6L nasal canula and then transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring and placed on a face tent.
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for 48 hours (vancomycin, levofloxacin, cefepime, and bactrim), however, his respiratory status failed to improve and cultures remained negative so antibiotics were stopped.
He did not tolerate oral bactrim due to nausea.
He was given morphine and nebs to treat his dyspnea and guiafenesin with codeine and benzonatate for cough.
The patient was continued on dexamethasone per his outpatient regimen which was initiated at the time of his whole brain radiation.
It is unclear if he is continuing to derive benefit from this medication so consideration to stopping this medication can be given.
As he has been on this medication for almost a month, it will need to be tapered before stopping completely.
There are no further treatment options per the patient's oncologist.
Palliative care was consulted and made [**Known lastname 7219**] for symptom management including dyspnea, nausea, and insomnia.
He is being discharged to inpatient hospice for further symptom management and due to his high oxygen requirement.
He was given IVF and lasix and calcium remained elevated.
He was also treated with a dose of pamidronate and calcitonin.
