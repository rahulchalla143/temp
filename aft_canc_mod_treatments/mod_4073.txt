While at [**Hospital **] Hospital, first few days of her hospitalization, she spiked a fever to 101.6 F.  She was started on ceftazidime and supportive blood products.
At [**Hospital1 **], it was planned for the patient to begin therapy for her hairy cell leukemia with 2-CDA.
Prior to undergoing chemotherapy, she had a PPD tuberculin skin test placed.
She was treated therefore instead with interferon-alpha 3 mIU 3x q week on [**4-3**], [**4-7**], [**4-10**], and [**4-12**].
A splenectomy was apparently considered, but instead she underwent splenic radiation on [**3-30**], [**4-6**], and [**4-9**].
She was also started on Neupogen from [**3-29**] to [**4-8**] in attempts to increase her neutrophil count.
She was started on ceftazidime as noted above.
Therefore, she was started on a four-drug regimen of rifampin, ethambutol, INH, pyrazinamide, and paroxetine.
She was continued on these medications from [**2128-3-23**] to [**2128-4-10**].
She was started on antifungals including fluconazole and AmBisome because the rash was felt to be disseminated candidiasis.
Then switched to imipenem and azithromycin, which was then switched to imipenem and vancomycin.
At the time of transfer to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2128-4-13**], she is on vancomycin, levofloxacin, Bactrim, and amikacin.
Per their records, the vancomycin was for empiric coverage of line infection.
Levofloxacin and amikacin were for atypical mycobacteria.
Bactrim was for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
Vancomycin 1 gram IV q.12.
Protonix 40 mg p.o.
Amikacin 360 IV q.12.
Levofloxacin 500 IV q.24.
Tylenol prn.
She was volume resuscitated with IV fluids and blood products.
She reportedly failed a cortisol stimulation test, so she was started on hydrocortisone and Florinef.
Bactrim was discontinued.
She was started on GM-CSF on [**2128-4-16**] and followed by the Hematology/Oncology service.
Status post appendectomy 17 years prior to admission.
A right internal jugular central venous line was in place with site clean, dry, and intact without any evidence of erythema or purulent discharge.
Skin exam was remarkable for a desquamating erythematous papular rash with also plaque formation of her face, trunk, and extremities.
She was initially treated supportively with blood transfusions to keep her hematocrit above 25 and platelets greater than 10.
Atypical mycobacterial bacteremia:  Patient is followed by the Infectious Disease service, and was treated with moxifloxacin, clarithromycin, linezolid, amikacin, clindamycin to cover her postobstructive pneumonia and AmBisome to cover for fungal infection.
She was cultured repeatedly for temperature spikes including cultures of her blood, urine, stool, sputum.
Therefore, linezolid, amikacin, moxifloxacin, and clindamycin were discontinued.
Patient was treated instead just with clarithromycin and AmBisome.
Therefore, she was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics including linezolid to cover gram-positive, moxifloxacin and amikacin to cover gram-negatives, clindamycin to cover anaerobes, and AmBisome to cover fungal infection.
Febrile neutropenia:  Throughout her hospital course, the patient was persistently febrile up to 104-105 degrees F. She was covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics as outlined above.
After identification of her Mycobacterial infection by the state laboratory, her antibiotic coverage was narrowed to cover just this atypical infection as well as to cover for fever and neutropenia status post chemotherapy.
Hypoxia:  On [**2128-4-29**], the patient had an episode of an acute desaturation going from 96% oxygen saturation on 2 liters nasal cannula to 80% on a 100% nonrebreather face mask.
She was treated with 20 mg of intravenous Lasix and Ativan with much clinical improvement.
She had no invasive procedures performed while she was in the Intensive Care Unit.
Simply improved after receiving Lasix and Ativan as outlined above.
There was also concern that the patient's acute pulmonary edema could have been secondary to inflammation induced by chemotherapy with 2-CDA.
Therefore, 2-CDA was held that evening and she received one dose of intravenous steroids.
She responded to fluid boluses, and did not require intravenous pressor support.
She failed a cortisol stimulation test on [**2128-4-14**] and was started on hydrocortisone and Florinef.
Desquamating skin rash:  The patient developed a diffuse skin rash after treatment with Bactrim at [**Hospital1 **].
They felt that her rash is most likely related to Bactrim or cephalosporin use.
Patient's rash improved after discontinuation of Bactrim as well as administration of topical ointments.
Stool cultures are negative for any infectious etiology including Clostridium difficile.
She was treated supportively with intravenous fluids and electrolyte repletion.
Transaminitis:  Patient experienced acute elevations in her liver function tests after administration of amphotericin at [**Hospital1 **].
There was also a small bump after initiation of anti-tuberculosis medications.
Patient's transaminase enzyme levels decreased after discontinuation of AmBisome and her anti-tuberculosis medications.
