Central catheter remains in place, though the endotracheal tube has been withdrawn.
Cervical fusion device is again seen.
This is the territory supplied by the vessels which were embolized on [**5-7**], [**2194**] and the appearance of the bowel wall may be secondary to the embolization procedure rather than indicative of the underlying cause of the GI bleeding.
Chromogranin A       2.8      Ref Range   1.9-15.0 ng/mL    Brief Hospital Course: 46 yo woman with DM2, hx GI ulcers, gastritis, initially admitted to the ICU for abdominal pain and GI/jejunal bleed, transferred to the general medical floor when stabilized.
# Jejunal bleed: She was transferred from an OSH ICU for hemodynamic instability related to a GI bleed after having several weeks of melenotic stools.
Her first IR procedure on [**5-7**] showed a transient bleeding source in the jejunum that had unfortunately vanished prior to intervention.
She was intubated for airway support due to clinical instability, and was transferred back to the IR suite.
2 coils were placed for a likely jejunal bleeding source, however the observed bleeding pattern was concerning for a tumor/malignancy.
Conversations with radiology/GI suggested CT enterography to further elucidate the source of her bleed, which showed nonspecific findings s/p embolization procedure.
GI and surgery were following, with some concern for small bowel tumors including carcinoid, lymphoma, and NET.
Urine 5-HIAA could not be sent due to patient drinking tea and a special tube for serum serotonin was not able to be obtained.
Total blood products used during hospitalization: 16 RBCs, 4 FFP, 2 platelets, 2 cryo.
# Fever/UTI/infection: She was cultured for a temperature of 100.6 in the ICU with a resistant-E.coli UTI in the context of a Foley catheter, and was started on Bactrim.
She will continue a 7-day course for treatment of a complicated UTI and her Foley catheter was discontinued.
She was transitioned to PO pain meds and was discharged with 5-7 days worth of oxycodone.
# Neuropathy: She was continued on gabapentin.
