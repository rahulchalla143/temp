ASA was held [**10-25**] due to 1 episode of melena.
He was put on heparin drip and then switched to coumadin.
He was also started on a beta blocker.
Although he was volume overloaded after being treated for sepsis in the MICU, he remained euvolemic after the extra volume was removed by dialysis.

Coumadin and ASA were held, but after 1 week of remaining clinically stable were restarted.
On [**10-25**] he had an episode of melena, coumadin and ASA were held.
