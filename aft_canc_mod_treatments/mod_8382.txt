The patient was given one dose of Ceftazidime in the clinic.
The patient complained of pruritus and was given Benadryl IV.
Given the patient's persistent hypotension despite intravenous fluid, the MICU Team was called to evaluate him.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a white blood cell count of 0.2, hematocrit 21.8, platelet count 15, 90% neutrophils, 0% lymphs, 2% eosinophils; INR 1.2, PTT 27.5; fibrinogen 611; sodium 133, potassium 3.9, chloride 98, CO2 18, BUN 25, creatinine 1.4, glucose 270; AST 9, ALT 27, LDH 87, alkaline phosphatase 103, total bilirubin 1.2, direct bilirubin 0.6, magnesium 1.1, phosphate 2.7.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 63-year-old male with a history of acute myelogenous leukemia who is day 14 of consolidation chemotherapy who presented with fever and neutropenia.
Here, he was started on an epinephrine drip.
He was treated empirically with Vancomycin and ................... and continued on Solu-Medrol 80 mg q.8  for probable anaphylaxis.
At this time, he was switched to an oral Prednisone at taper and was continued on Benadryl and Zantac.
They recommended decreasing the patient's steroids to Prednisone 60 mg q.d.
They also instructed us to avoid to all penicillins and cephalosporins, although Vancomycin and .................... were thought to be appropriate.
He was continued on his Vancomycin, as well as ..................
The patient subsequently was continued only on Vancomycin, as well as Gentamicin times four days for augmentation.
The initial plan was to continue to treat the patient with Vancomycin and to subsequently reimage after a short duration of antibiotic therapy.
This revealed a 5.2 x 4.5 cm cystic lesion with rim enhancement over the right psoas.
The patient subsequently underwent a CT-guided placement of a pigtail catheter over the right psoas abscess.
He underwent ultrasound-guided aspiration of right shoulder, as well as the left calf.
Subsequent cultures from these fluid collections grew MRSA.
The patient underwent incision and drainage of the right deltoid and left calf fluid collections.
This procedure was done on [**6-1**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from General Surgery.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Of note, the psoas collection was noted to have resolved, and the pigtail catheter was removed.
At the time of this dictation, the recommendation of the Infectious Disease team is for a total of 12 weeks of Vancomycin therapy.
He was continued on Neupogen 480 mcg subcue q.d.
The patient underwent a repeat bone marrow aspiration to evaluate for response after consolidation chemotherapy.
The bone marrow aspirate was consistent with remission.
The patient will follow with his primary oncologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for continuation of his chemotherapy.
We dosed his Vancomycin only for trough levels of less than 20.
