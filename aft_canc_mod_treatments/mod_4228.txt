She developed shortness of breath, rhinorrhea, post nasal drip and cough.
Her temp was 100.5 and given her cough she was thought to have a bacterial infection and was given augmentin 10 day course, and 4 day course of prednisone 40mg daily.
She completed her prednisone but while on the augmentin she developed 3-4 episodes of diarrhea per day.
Of note her she has chronic PAF, on coumadin, s/p cardioversion in [**2152**].
Rate/rhythm control previously on procainamide, dig, atenolol -> now on dig, atenolol, still primarily in sinus, with occ runs of afib.
Discussion with cardiology at that time led to increasing atenolol and stopping the amlodipine.
As of [**Month (only) **] in [**2168**] her atenolol had not been increased, and per discussion with cards at that time, PCP increased to atenolol 50mg daily.
but because of concern for C. diff she was given IV flagyl.
She was given 4L of normal saline based on her tachycardia as well as her history of diarrhea.
After 4L of NS her lactate was 5.7.

Enlarged right atrium with retrograde opacification of IVC and hepatic veins with bilateral pleural effusions, ascites and body wall edema suggestive of right heart failure.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 82 year old female with multiple medical problems including CAD, AS, [**Name (NI) 17584**] who presents with diarrhea in the setting of antibiotics for a UTI and found to be dehydrated and tachycardic.
Per radiology, ischemia is strong consideration especially given heart disease and extensive ASD of celiac and SMA.
Patient was treated for infectious colitis with vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl.
Flagyl and zosyn were continued throughout ICU course.
Echo in [**5-27**] showed mild c.LVH with EF 55-60%, [**Doctor Last Name **] and mild RVE, mild-mod AS with peak/mean grad 24/13 and [**Location (un) 109**] 0.8 cm2, mod MR, mod-severe TR with stable pulm art HTN (PAp=46).
Patient was diuresed with lasix 20 mg IV.
She was loaded on IV amiodarone and was transitioned to PO amiodarone.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended starting aspirin and statin.
Pt was started on aspirin 325 mg daily.
Patient was not started on statin given elevation in LFTs while in ICU.
Atrial fibrillation: Her atenolol was increased to 50mg daily in [**2170-2-16**] and her digoxin dose remained the same.
Did not respond to esmolol given hypotension and was loaded with amiodarone which improved rate to 95-100.
Patient was switched to PO amiodarone following IV load.
Digoxin was stopped in the context of acute renal failure.
Metoprolol was uptitrated to 37.5 TID while in ICU and rate was well controlled.
Patient was treated with ipratropium nebs, robutussin, and flonase.
Surgery was consulted for possible ischemic colitis as above and infection was treated initially with broad spectrum antibiotics in ICU.
Patient received IV fluids on admission without great improvement.
Following ECHO, ARF thought possibly [**12-20**] to poor forward flow - started diuresis with lasix IV boluses.
Causes include medication interaction, vitamin K deficiency, impaired liver function, heart failure, and diarrhea.
Patient receive PO and IV vitamin K.  INR trended down to 2.6 and coumadin was restarted at low dose of 0.5 mg daily (given that patient is on amiodarone and antibiotics).
Infection and shock liver also possibilities given parainfluenza and hypotension.
# Large B cell lymphoma: Dx [**2161**]: Rx local XRT; [**2-19**]: 2 x [**Hospital1 **], 4 x Rit/CHOP chemo.
Relapsed [**4-22**]: given Zevalin at [**Hospital1 18**] (Followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
No plan for surgery at present, cardiology will consult as above.
Metoprolol initially titrated up to 37.5 mg TID but patient became bradycardic and hypotensive.
Amiodarone was stopped due to concern for amiodarone-induced hepatic toxicity.
Patient restarted on home regimen of digoxin 125 mcg and Metoprolol titrated up to 25 mg po TID with HR in the 60-90s.
Patient kept on aspirin, metoprolol (see above).
Lisinopril was initially added but patient became hypotensive so it was stopped.
