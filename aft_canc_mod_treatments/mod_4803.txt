A nasogastric tube is noted within the stomach.
A 10-French internal-external biliary drainage catheter was placed via the right-sided bile ducts and has been left to straight bag drainage.
Further definitive management of the biliary obstruction will be performed once the cholangitis has settled with biliary drainage and antibiotic treatment.
CXR [**2121-3-12**] IMPRESSION: 1) Tip of an endotracheal tube located 1 cm above the level of the carina.
The tube should be retracted approximately 3 cm for optimal positioning.
BILIARY STONE REMOVAL [**2121-3-18**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Balloon dilatation of the obstructed common bile duct with 8 mm cutting balloon and 10 mm regular balloons.
10-French external-internal biliary drainage catheter was placed with the pigtail locked in the small bowel loop.
The catheter was connected with an external drainage bag.
Status post percutaneous biliary drainage with a catheter extending into the duodenum.
Obliteration of the portal vein in segments II and an adjacent portion of segment IV with increased arterial perfusion of the affected segments.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 78 yo F with DM, HTN, s/p cholecystectomy who was transferred by [**Location (un) **] from [**Hospital3 3583**] intubated/sedated for ERCP and further management of sepsis secondary to cholangitis.
She was also continued on Zosyn, with the plan to complete a full course of antibiotics for cholangitis.
Therefore she underwent a PTC, with successful placement of an internal/external drain.
After extubated and removal of sedation she was quite confused, and was noted to have some asymmetry at her mouth.
She was continued on Zosyn and her bile cultures grew gram negative rods, enterococcus and viridans streptococci.
She was maintained on IV Zosyn and was transitioned to oral Levofloxacin to complete a 10 day course (to end [**2121-3-31**]).
The pt underwent an interventional radiology guided dilatation of CBD stenosis also had a percutaneous drain placed in the common bile duct (as mentioned above).
The drain will stay in place for 4-6 weeks at which point pt will be reevaluated by a cholangoigram (scheduled already) to determine timing for removal of drainage by interventional radiology.
The pt was noted to have portal vein thrombosis for which she will need work-up by her primary care physician.
She was treated with IV Zosyn and transitioned to PO Levofloxacin to complete a 10 day course (to end [**2121-3-31**]).
The pt remained afebrile and her percutaneous drain (mentioned above) in the bile duct continued to drain about 1.5 liters daily.
The bile drain was plugged prior to the pt's discharge and will need to stay plugged until the pt's appointment with interventional radiology on [**2121-4-23**]; at that time pt will be reevaluated to see if restenosis has occurred.
GI: The pt was noted to have acute cholangitis in the setting of CBD stenosis.
The pt underwent a 10-French internal-external biliary drainage catheter placement for drainage for dilated bile ducts.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], and it was decided that he will initiate an out-patient workup for the thrombosis.
Pt was maintained on Captopril during the hospitalization and was transitioned back to her home regimen of Lisinopril on discharge.
Anemia: The pt was noted to have a hematocrit drop from 40 to 33 with IVF hydration in the ICU.
The pt will likely benefit from an out-patient workup of her anemia and will likely need to be scheduled for a colonoscopy by her PCP.
The pt was noted to have acute renal failure on admission (Cr 2.2) which resolved with hydration and treatment of acute cholangitis.
The pt sustained minor Foley trauma when she accidentally pulled out her Foley (with bulb inflated) while trying to get back into bed from chair.
The Foley was replaced and continued to drain normally.
The foley should eventually removed prior to discharge from rehab.
Endocrine: The pt has a history of diabetes for which she was maintained on a regular insulin sliding scale.
FEN: The pt was maintained on a low fat diet and her electrolytes were repleted as needed.
Prophylaxis: The pt was maintained on prophylaxis with SC heparin and proton pump inhibitor.
