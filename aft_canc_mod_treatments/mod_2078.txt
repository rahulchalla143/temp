He required levophed and aggressive fluid hydration to maintain SBP>100 and was started on fludrocotisone for possible adrenal insufficiency.
A cortasyn stim test was performed and he was seen to respond, so we discontinued fludrocortisone and hydrocortisone.
Sepsis was considered and he was broadly covered on admission with ambisome, imipenem, voriconazole.
He was weaned off vasopressors and IVF on HD3 and SBP's remained in the 90's but he was asymptomatic, making urine, and had normal lactate so no further intervention was made.
He had been on empiric treatment for fungal process with ambisome and vorinazole for 3 months, then voriconazole alone since [**4-1**], but was off this for four days before admission.
Chest CT revealed no nodular infection but a RLL infiltrate concerning for CAP and on HD2 was started on levofloxacin.
At that same time he was started on Vancomycin since his allergy was questionable and he had a permanent tunneled line.
He developed periorbital edema and diffuse skin etyhema, elevated LFT's and eosinophilia thought initially due to vancomycin so this was stopped.
Vancomycin was changed to daptomycin which was stopped [**4-21**] given blood cultures remained negative x 48 hours.
Pt's LFT's continued to rise off of the vancomycin so the levofloxacin was changed to azithromycin which he completed a 10 day course of.
He was then started on voriconazole as below for risk of recurrence of fungal infection with immunosuppressive treatment for GVHD as below.
At this point he was started on cyclosporine dosed to trough >100 and a day later Mycofenolate was added.
He was continued on immunosuppressive therapy as above and on [**5-3**] was feeling well so plan was made for further workup and treatment of elevated LFT's as an outpt.
He was treated with his outpatient dose of oxycontin in hospital which he responded well to.
