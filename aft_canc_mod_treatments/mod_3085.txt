His repeat biopsies here at [**Hospital1 1444**] revealed in fact high-grade muscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma, and the patient was then entered into a bladder-sparing protocol where he received gemcitabine, Taxol, and carboplatin chemotherapy.
He was then removed from the bladder-sparing protocol and referred for radical surgery.
He was advised the risks and benefits of the surgery and wished to proceed.
Appendectomy in [**2162**].
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Proscar 5 mg p.o.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] and taken to the operating room on [**2188-4-22**] where he underwent radical cystoprostatectomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection, multiple biopsies of his mesentery, as well as creation of an orthotopic ileal neobladder.
He tolerated this procedure well and was taken to the Intensive Care Unit postoperatively.
He was continued on three days of Ancef and Flagyl prophylaxis.
Following his procedure, he was nothing by mouth with a nasogastric tube in place.
He did have a suprapubic tube placed in the operating room as well as a urethral catheter and two ureteral stents that were brought out through a separate stab wound.
All of these were draining urine well with very minimal output initially from the Foley catheter and the suprapubic tube.
Throughout the beginning of his course, his urine output gradually became more increased through his Foley and suprapubic tube and less through the stents.
His pain continued to be controlled with a morphine patient-controlled analgesia.
He continued to do quite well, and flushes of his neobladder were begun with 30 cc of saline through the urethral catheter and gently aspirated.
On postoperative day four, the patient was started on Lovenox subcutaneously at prophylactic doses.
The patient had a known deep venous thrombosis, but at this point the goal was to re-anticoagulate the patient once he was tolerating an oral diet with Coumadin and to leave his Lovenox at prophylactic doses.
On postoperative day two, the patient received some intravenous Toradol for pain control; however, his creatinine abruptly rose to 1.3, and the Toradol was discontinued after two doses.
The nasogastric tube was removed.
On postoperative day ten, the patient was taken down to the Cystoscopy Suite; before which he was given a dose of intravenous gentamicin.
Under fluoroscopic guidance, his bilateral ureteral stents were removed without difficulty.
A dressing was applied, and he was left with his suprapubic tube and urethral catheter both to gravity drainage.
At this point, his Coumadin was restarted on postoperative day seven; however, his INR had not bumped above 1.3 at this point.
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (His discharge medications included) 1.
Colace 100 mg p.o.
Percocet one to two tablets p.o.
Coumadin (dosed on a daily regimen for an INR in the range of 2 to 3).
He was previously on 5 mg of Coumadin once per day with 7.5 mg twice per week prior to his operation.
He may require a different dosing regimen as he has had a bowel preparation and a large abdominal operation.
