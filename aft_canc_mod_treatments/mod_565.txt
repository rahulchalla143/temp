Path: SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY: DIAGNOSIS: DIFFUSE INVOLVEMENT BY NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA (DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA).
Erythrocytes are decreased in numbers, and exhibit moderate anisopoikilocytosis with polychromatophils, echinocytes, dacrocytes, and rare red cell fragments.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides: The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation, and consists of a 1.3 cm bone biopsy diffusely infiltrated with large cells with moderate amounts of pink cytoplasm, irregularly shaped nuclei with clumpy chromatin, and prominent nucleoli.
ADDENDUM: Bone marrow [**Last Name (un) **]-in situ hybridization reveals few scattered cells positively hybridized, far beyond the non-reactive negative control.
They do not express any other characteristic antigens including CD10 or FMC-7.

Hospital course has been notable for lymphoma diagnosed on bone marrow biopsy, BAL with negative PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] and urine with positive histo ag, prolonged pancytopenia, and hypotension.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was given additional 1U PRBC and 1L IVF with improvement in his BPs.
#Anemia: GI was consulted for acute anemia and guiaic+ stool, they recommended inpatient EGD/colonoscopy after further stabilization.
Pt stabilized and these procedures were not done.
Transfusion requirement tapered down after ambisome was stopped.
was started on Dexamethasone [**Date range (1) 14618**].
#Histoplasmosis: Urine was histo ag positive.
Patient was started on Ambisome but then later switched to itraconazole, which per ID he will likely need for life.
Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia given improvement with hydration via NS.
#AIDS: Patient was seen by Infectious Disease and started on ART along with ppx for PCP and MAC.
Darunovir and Ritonavir were discontinued because they interact with chemotherapy agents and he was instead started on another protease inhibitor, Raltegravir.
He was given pentamidine on [**8-8**].
He will continue on prophylactic acyclovir, azithromycin and atovaquone.
Patient was isolated for TB and was empirically treated for PCP with prednisone and Bactrim (prednisone for transient hypoxia/[**Doctor First Name **]) until BAL was negative for PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] cxs were unremarkable, but given degree of immunosuppression patient was empirically treated for bacterial pneumonia with Vancomycin/Zosyn/Levofloxacin for a 14 day course.
Chest X-ray was unclear regarding possible pneumonia as a source of fevers, and he was initially started on antibiotics.
Review of his medication list and elimination of medications that might possibly have been causing thrombocytopenia did not improve thrombocytopenia.
He was therefore administered a five-day course of IVIG to neutralise the anti-platelet antibodies.
This resulted in some, but not complete improvement in response to platelet transfusions.

Your fever was thought to be secondary to an infectious process and you were treated with antibiotics after which your temperature normalized.
A lumbar puncture was done to determine whether or not you had disease in the fluid and you were empirically treated with injection of a chemotherapy [**Doctor Last Name 360**] into the spinal fluid.
You were treated for the lymphoma with intravenous chemotherapy.
You were subsequently treated with a second round of intravenous chemotherapy, which you tolerated well.
The following changes were made to your medications: HAART regimen (for AIDS): -DISCONTINUED: darunavir and ritonavir -STARTED: raltegravir It is VERY important that you take these medications daily because not only do they treat AIDS but they also help your body to fight the lymphoma  - Nicotine patch  - Prednisone  - Itraconazole - this is an anti-fungal for the histoplasma  - Azithromycin  - Atovaquone  - Acyclovir  - Oral Gel  - Viscous Lidocaine  - Quetiapine  - Omeprazole  - Bowel regimen (senna, sodium docusate, polyethylene glycol, lactulose)  - Filgastrim  Please followup with your oncology and infectious disease doctors, see below.
