There is a Foley catheter present within the bladder.
A mass in the left posterior superior aspect of the L5 vertebral body extends into the left anterior epidural space, displacing the left L5 nerve root posteriorly.
MR CERVICAL AND THORACIC SPINE [**2197-9-11**]: CERVICAL SPINE: Multifocal cervical spine metastases are identified including involvement of the dens and left aspect of the C2 vertebral body with involvement of the right pedicle and facet of C2 also observed.
There is also evidence of involvement of the spinous process and right facet at C4 as well as involvement of the left pedicle and facet at C6.
Vertebral body height and alignment is maintained and there is no evidence for spinal canal narrowing or cord compression.
Perfusion images in the same 8 views show heterogeneity in a sub-segmental distibution, also most likely due to airways disease.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a sixty two year old male presenting with confusion, urinary retention, hypernatremia and hypercalcemia found to have a large calcified bladder mass and likely metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder.
They felt that tissue diagnosis should be obtained in order to proceed with palliative radiation therapy and possibly chemotherapy.
The team suggested vertebroplasty for the T2 fracture rather than surgery given the widespread nature of disease.
However, if the patient and his family wanted more aggressive treatment they recommended surgical resection of the T2 lesion with adjuvant XRT.
The orthopedic trauma team saw the patient in regards to his femur lesions and recommended IM rod for the right femur given the large size of the bony metastasis and the risk of fracture.
None of these interventions were pursued given the family's request to have the patient transferred to St. [**Hospital 11042**] Hospital in NY for further medical management.
Hypernatremia has resolved with intravenous fluids.
Hypercalcemia has been treated with pamidronate and calcitonin and intravenous fluids, though free calcium continues to be high.
3)Pneumonia:A CXR on [**9-14**] showed possible right sided infiltrate concerning for pneumonia.
That patient was initially treated for community acquired pneumonia with Levaquin,however, white count continued to increase and patient's oxygen requirment became greater so his antibiotic coverage was switched to vancomycin and zosyn on [**9-15**].
Patient has a PICC line in place.
He should continue Vancomycin and Zosyn for 7 more days to complete a 14 day course (now on day 7).
Patient was initially treated with Levaquin which was switched to Zosyn for empiric treatment of hospital acquired pneumonia as noted above.
As noted above, he should continue Vancomycin and Zosyn for another 7 days to complete a 14 day course of antibiotics.
5)Hypercalcemia: Ionized calcium was 2.03 on admission.
Patient was treated with Pamidronate 30 mg IV x 1 on [**9-11**] and calcitonin 100 units x 6 days.
Calcium has trended down following this treatment though free calcium remains elevated at 1.35 and total calcium of 11.1.
We have continued the patient on intravenous fluids.
6)Hypernatremia: Sodium was 164 on admission.
Patient seen by the renal consult team who recommended fluid resucitation with D5W.
Iron studies demonstrated normal iron level and ferritin with low TIBC and transferrin.
Patient seen by nutrition who felt that PEG placement for tube feeds would be necessary given poor caloric intake.
PEG was not pursued given plans for transfer and family wishing for all procedures to occur at St. [**Doctor Last Name 11042**].
