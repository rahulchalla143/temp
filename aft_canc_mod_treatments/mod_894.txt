HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   67-year-old man with a history of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed in 12/97.
The patient is status post multiple courses of chemotherapy, including chlorambucil, prednisone, CVP, fludarabine, Rituxan, adriamycin, and Decadron.
He was treated with ceftazidime, but had no signs of infection.
The patient received Taxol chemotherapy that Thursday, [**2137-10-3**], prior to discharge.
In the Emergency Room this time, the patient received ceftazidime 2 grams x 1, Tylenol, Motrin and intravenous fluids.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed in [**2133-11-23**]; a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma status post multiple chemotherapeutic treatments 2.
Ethanol abuse some 30 years ago  MEDICATIONS:  Terazosin 5 mg daily at bedtime, quinine 325 mg daily at bedtime, prednisone 4 mg once daily, GCSF 300 mg once daily, Megace 400 mg twice a day.
On arrival to the floor, the patient was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 70/palp, and therefore two large bore intravenous lines were placed with fluids running wide open.
He was given platelet transfusions and placed on neutropenic precautions.
Therefore, after panculture, the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics to include piperacillin, gentamicin and vancomycin.
Throughout the first day of admission, however, the patient became increasingly more lethargic and difficult to arouse, with decreased blood pressure to 80/50 and again he was treated with fluids and platelet transfusion.
He received a total of five more liters of normal saline before transfer to the Intensive Care Unit.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, he was supported hemodynamically with transfusions of two units of blood and platelets as necessary.
They recommended a six week course of intravenous oxacillin.
Therefore, the patient received a PICC line to complete a six week course of oxacillin at home.
With regard to the patient's myocardial infarction in the setting of hypotension, he was started on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor, as these have been shown to be myocardial protective.
Dermatology was consulted during this hospitalization for biopsy, which revealed a pathology consistent with septic vasculitis and therefore treated with oxacillin as above.
Neutropenia  (It should be noted that the patient's neutropenia resolved during the hospitalization, and his GCSF was discontinued at this time.)
Terazosin 5 mg daily at bedtime 2.
Megace 400 mg twice a day 3.
Lisinopril 10 mg by mouth once daily 4.
Lopressor 12.5 mg by mouth twice a day 5.
