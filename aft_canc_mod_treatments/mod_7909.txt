Head CT was performed and demonstrated a large left frontal mass and patient was medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further neurosurgical evaluation.
Unable to obtain history from patient due to intubated status.
U/a was positive for glucosuria and ketones with blood but no rbcs.

IMPRESSION: Endotracheal tube in standard position, terminating 3.8 cm from the carina.
A coiled catheter is noted within the hypopharynx, and likely reflects a coiled NG or OG tube for which clinical correlation is advised.
Layering fluid is seen in the posterior nasopharynx and the patient's nasogastric tube is coiled in the nasopharynx.
NG tube is coiled within the nasopharynx.
Postoperative changes status post resection of large left frontal extra-axial mass with loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation anterior left frontal lobe.
It is impossible to know the exact cause that led to patient's initial presentation with altered mental status requiring intubation for airway protection.
By [**2108-2-17**], patient was able to answer questions with [**Hospital1 2824**] content rather than single word answers but continued with evidence of delirium.
Patient was started on 300 mg of Dilantin daily on presentation.
Her serum osm was followed closely on initial presentation given her critical condition.
Her level was measured on a regular basis and dosed after adjusting for low albumin (2.8) for goal of [**11-8**]..  CTA showed obvious necrosis and complex vascularization of the tumor.
As patient's DKA/HHS/HONC resolved, she was started with 2 mg dexamethasone every 6 hours.
Neurosurgery was closely involved with patient's care and recommended tumor resection given medical urgency.
Patient underwent craniostomy and tumor resection on [**2108-2-17**] after a WAND study.
A post op MRI showed post op changes and resection of tumor.
She will need to have outpatient mammography done to screen for breast cancer given association with meningioma.
She was treated with aggressive hydration with normal saline.
She was rehydrated with bolus IVF as well as a D5 1/2NS drip when sugars trended below 200.
Initially she was maintained on an insulin gtt and then transitioned to ISS when her anion gap closed.
In the MICU, patient reported taking metformin as an outpatient.
Her oral medication was held given acute illness.
After she transitioned to Medicine Floor, patient was switched to [**Hospital1 **] NPH/Novolin and ISS.
As her oral intake improved, she was transitioned and titrated to [**Hospital1 **] Novolin N 15 units with meal time Novolog 5 unit and an aggressive ISS given patient was on dexamethasone prior to surgery.
The extend of her frostbites include 2 degree with large bullae and skin loss and spread from bilaterally buttocks to entire posterior thighs as well as right sided lateroposterior leg (~17-20% loss).
Wound care and plastics surgery were consulted.
She had her wound cared for twice a day with wound cleansers.
Initially both Silverdene, Xeroform, and large sofsorb sponges were used per Plastic recommendations.
She was [**Last Name (un) **] on ciprofloxacin for a total of 6 days for wound prophylaxis.
Foley catheter was changed on [**2108-2-15**] because of yeast presence on urine, likely from colonization in the Foley.
Foley catheter was changed.
She was on ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis given significant wounds for a total of about 6 days.
Tachycardia is also stable and slightly improved with fluid resuscitation from 110s to 100s.
She was on heparin for prophylaxis.
She was started on metoprolol and titrated to 50 mg TID by the time of her surgery for risk reduction.
Metoprolol could continue to be titrated.
This was noted after dexamethasone dose was increased.
Metoprolol was started as a way to control her heart rate for risk reduction and to also lower her BP.
Iron studies shows Fe/TIBC ratio to be 5%, Fe is low, MCV/RBC ratio ~ 20, and ferritin is unexpectedly low.
B12 and folate within normal.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and rewarmed using standard procedure.
She was given IVF to maintain urine output of 200-300 ml/hr.
She was treated with IVF with urine output goal of 200-300 ml/hr, and her creatinine was 0.5 on the day of her surgery.
It resolved after she was fluid resuscitated and placed on phenytoin while in the MICU and Medicine Floor.
There was an initial concern for phenytoin to be the cause, but this resolved spontaneously, possibly confounded by being on dexamethasone as well.
Patient was intubated for airway protection in the field in the setting of unresponsiveness.
She was able to be weaned off the ventilator after re-warming and was extubated on [**2108-2-7**] without event.

She tolerated the procedure well and went directly to the ICU for Q1 hour neuro checks and strict BP control to <140.
They made minor adjustments to her PM novolog and Novolin doses.
Her neurological exam remained intact, and she remained on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
-On [**2-23**] [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for assistance in managing her blood glucose leveles which have been fluctating as well as for assistance in long term management as her HgbA1C was 13 upon admission.
