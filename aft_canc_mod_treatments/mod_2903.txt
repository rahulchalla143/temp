He underwent right hemicolectomy on Friday [**6-24**].
He was extubated post operatively, but low SaO2 to the 80's post extubation despite NRB led to reintubation and transfer to the PACU.
Pst-operatively, on [**6-25**] he developed hypotension requiring Levophed gtt over the weekend which was weaned off the night prior to transfer.
A TTE was read as reduced LVEF to 25%, with mid/distal anterior wall akinesis, and inferior wall akinesis/scarring.
He was started on aspirin 325 mg and heparin gtt on [**6-25**] following the echo results.
The following day, [**6-26**] he was weaned off pressors and he was given another unit of pRBCs with good UOP.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Toes with scattered eschars on frontal surface (from "scraping concrete with his toes while walking") Pain with manipulation of right leg.

Continue with medical management of CAD and CHF.
Discharge labs:  [**2107-7-2**] 07:35AM BLOOD WBC-5.7 RBC-3.51* Hgb-10.5* Hct-32.5* MCV-93 MCH-29.9 MCHC-32.3 RDW-14.7 Plt Ct-246 [**2107-7-2**] 07:35AM BLOOD Glucose-87 UreaN-9 Creat-0.6 Na-139 K-3.4 Cl-103 HCO3-24 AnGap-15 [**2107-6-30**] 06:05AM BLOOD Calcium-8.1* Phos-3.8 Mg-2.0  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 60205**] is a 75 year old man with history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with left main (LM) stent in [**2106-6-9**] and prior CABG in [**2104**] who is transferred to the CCU from [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital for concern for NSTEMI given hypotension and decreased LVEF following surgery for large colon mass.
He underwent cardiac cath with no interventions, thought to have a autolysed thrombosis from heparin gtt > 48 hours before cath.
# CAD: patient has significant CAD s/p CABG and recent PCI in 2/[**2106**].
He was restarted on a heparin drip to cover for an acute plaque ruputure and admitted to the CCU.
Cardiac cath showed chronic disease with occluded RCA, LAD 60% occluded but prior stent patent, and Left circumflex 80% occluded.
We felt that the new wall motion abnormality and troponin elevation represented a true ischemic event, brought on by massive surgery, but that his prolonged heparin gtt was effective in lysing the clot prior to cath.
His medical regimen was optimized to: aspirin 81 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, lisinopril 2.5 mg daily, metoprolol succinate 50 mg daily, simvastatin 40 mg daily, furosemide 40 mg daily.
# Delerium- patient became delirious in the evenings, and required haldol 0.25mg x2.
This was also exacerbated by sedating medications used for cath, etc.
# Colon cancer status post right hemicolectomy at OSH: His wound healed well and he was able to pass stool and eat during this admission.
- will need appt with oncologist depending on pathology results.
