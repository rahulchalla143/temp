PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for two breast lumps, varicose veins, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  She was only taking Multivitamins and TUMS.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient presented on [**2186-11-2**] for her planned procedure of a pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy, aka Whipple procedure, along with an open cholecystectomy.
As a summary of these events in brief - The patient was postoperatively fluid-requiring and noticing that she was having slow oozing requiring blood products at a rate of several units a day postoperatively.
She was stable until postoperative day #2 when her hematocrit fell without appropriate response to blood products and her abdomen had become firm and tender.
Her abdomen was washed out and she was returned to the Intensive Care Unit setting still intubated on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for concern of an aspiration pneumonia.
She remained in the Intensive Care Unit for pulmonary toilet and continued diuresis.
On postoperative day #10 it was noticed that her [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] output had become bilious and Octreotide was restarted and her lines were changed.
Total parenteral nutrition was started at this time and she was pancultured with all cultures later revealing no growth.
On postoperative day #12, the patient underwent a swallow study to assess her swallowing ability and she aspirated thin liquids and failed the study.
On postoperative day #13, the patient underwent a video swallow study revealing aspiration of thin liquids that reversed with postural maneuvers in a chin tuck.
diet consisting of thin liquids with chin tuck and strict aspiration precautions in addition to pureed solids and all medications in pureed form.
The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day #12 on Zosyn for Serratia that grew out of the sputum on [**2186-11-7**] and she was continued on her total parenteral nutrition because of slow p.o.
She was additionally continued on Lasix for pulmonary diuresis.
At this time the patient remained very deconditioned and weak status post her two operations and she was found to have marginal mental status where she was able to understand questions but had trouble responding with speech which she attributes to a dry mouth.
A neurology consult was obtained on postoperative day #12 and revealed no focal findings, but they found that likely etiologic agents involved generalized weakness and deconditioning in addition to intervascular dehydration.
Her Octreotide was discontinued as it was having no effect on the biliary leak.
Additionally, on this day the patient underwent a right thoracentesis for her right pleural effusion and under ultrasound guidance the interventional radiologist was able to successfully drain 650 cc of clear straw-colored fluid.
She also underwent a left thoracentesis for 450 cc of clear fluid with her postoperative chest x-ray revealing no evidence of pneumothorax.
About four hours after returning from her left thoracentesis the house officer was emergently called as the patient had experienced question hemoptysis versus hematemesis where the nurse noted 50 cc of bright red blood coming out of the patient's mouth.
The patient was placed on a nonrebreather of 100% and emergently transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where a hematocrit showed a drop from 30 to 24.
The patient received 3 units of packed red cells and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma and she was continued on Vancomycin in addition to starting Levofloxacin and Fluconazole.
On postoperative day #15 an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed revealing blood in the stomach body.
She therefore was started on Sucralfate 1 gm q.i.d.
and Pantoprazole 40 mg intravenously b.i.d.
Additionally Flagyl was started for broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic coverage.
On postoperative day #16, the patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells during the night.
After a discussion, the decision was made that the patient would be Do-Not-Resuscitate, Do-Not-Intubate without any further operative interventions, and that her gastrointestinal bleed would be managed medically with transfusions of red cells as necessary.
She required no further transfusions, but her wound was opened revealing thick biliary secretions on top of a small bed of necrotic tissue, therefore the wound was packed with wet to dry dressings t.i.d.
The patient stabilized on postoperative day #18 to 20 and was later transferred to the floor on postoperative day #21 with a stable hematocrit on four antibiotic regimen, consisting of Fluconazole, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin and Flagyl.
Her Metoprolol was initially increased to 15 intravenously q.
6 hours for tachycardia and hypertension, but once she was able to take p.o.
her Metoprolol was changed to 75 mg p.o.
On postoperative day 22 to 28, noticeable findings included placement of a vacuum-assist closure device on her open wound that was changed every three days with good success revealing a nicely healed wound.
Her [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain that was draining copious amounts of bilious secretions was placed to wall suction.
Discussions were made with her sister and family members regarding the option of a feeding tube placement, but the decision was collectively made that the patient would not agree to a feeding tube placement and that she would continue to try to increase her p.o.
Her erythema had stabilized on broad-spectrum antibiotics and her white count had eventually decreased from the low 20s.
A PICC line was placed on postoperative day #25 and her left internal jugular central venous line was discontinued at this time.
On postoperative day #28 to 30 her white count continued to decrease from 20 to 14.6 and the right lateral abdominal erythema had virtually resolved on her antibiotic course.
Her biliary drain remained with a stable output of about 300 cc/day.
Her wound appeared much better after vacuum-assisted closure device and required occasional debridement prior to vacuum-assisted closure dressing changes.
On postoperative day #31, the patient was discontinued to rehabilitation in stable condition.
Her right lateral erythema had virtually resolved and her total body edema had much decreased after her auto diuresis for the past four days.
Her vacuum-assisted closure dressing was changed on the day of discharge by surgical house officers who noted that the wound continued to heal well.
