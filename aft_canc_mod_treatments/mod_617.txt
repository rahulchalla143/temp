History of Present Illness: 47yo M with PMHx metastatic colon CA to liver and lungs, hereditary telangiectasias complicated by chronic nosebleeds, a TIA, and a large pulmonary AVM repaired in [**12/2106**] who presented on [**2113-2-25**] with chest and calf pain and fever.
He is on FLOX chemotherapy (5-FU, oxaliplatin, leucovorin), and is cycle 1, week 2; last dose was on [**2-23**].
He also had a power port placed without complications on [**2-24**].
The recent port-a-cath placement site in left chest did not look infected.
O2 sats remained stable at 92% on RA and 98% on 2L NC with HRs and BPs stable.
However, with the need for anticoagulation in setting of AVMs in his lung and nose it was thought he would be better served by close monitoring in the ICU on heparin gtt.
His oxygen saturation was 99% on 3L NC with RR of 17.
pt reports his pulmonologist is thinking about another closure procedure for another shunt - nosebleeds - systemic emboli - TIA - iron deficiency anemia  Social History: Patient is originally from [**Country 13622**] Republic; he just recently returned from there, cutting a 3 week vacation short, after a CT scan of his abdomen showed liver lesions.
He also has an ex-girlfriend in [**Name (NI) 86**], with whom he had a daughter.
His ex-girlfriend and daughter were with him in the room.
Urine: [**2113-2-26**] URINE Blood-NEG Nitrite-NEG Protein-NEG Glucose-NEG Ketone-NEG Bilirub-NEG Urobiln-NEG pH-6.5 Leuks-NEG [**2113-2-26**] URINE Hours-RANDOM UreaN-271 Creat-46 Na-62 Uric Ac-35.1 [**2113-2-26**] URINE Osmolal-396  Brief Hospital Course: 47yo M with h/o metastatic colon CA, pulmonary and nasal AVMs with continuous nosebleeds admitted with fever, calf and chest pain and found to have subsegmental PEs admitted for anticoagulation.
# PE: Likely secondary to underlying malignancy, and given that the patient has a high risk of bleed from AVM's and telangiectasias, he was monitored in the ICU during initiation of anticoagulation with weight based Heparin gtt.
After stable anticoagulation with heparin gtt while in the ICU, patient transferred to floor on heparin gtt.
Patient started on coumadin; heparin gtt discontinued and started on lovenox.
Patient discharged with plans for lovenox bridge to coumadin with close INR follow-up in the outpatient setting.
Patient resistant to the idea of injections long-term so would prefer coumadin as outpatient with simply a short lovenox bridge.
Concern that this might be an issue as the patient is being anti-coagulated long term, but was stable with AVM's and anticoagulation during hospitalization.
It was posited that it could be secondary to SIADH given lung mets/stress response and with urine electrolytes that supported SIADH.
# Metastatic colon CA: Patient on FLOX chemotherapy regimen, now cycle 1, week 2, on admission.
Patient treated with another day of FLOX chemotherapy and tolerated this without incident, on [**3-2**].
# Constipation: patient required aggressive bowel regimen to relieve constipation and associated abdominal discomfort.
patient takes multiple opiates for abdominal pain, and so medication and disease likely both contribute to his constipation.
patient discharged with opiates for abdominal pain (home pain regimen) and with bowel regimen.
The patient demonstrated no localizing source of infection and was not neutropenic so no antibiotics were started.
He was placed on q8H HCT checks given his Heparin gtt and an active T&S was maintained throughout his stay.
# Coagulopathy: Thought to be [**1-10**] liver dysfunction from liver metastases.
