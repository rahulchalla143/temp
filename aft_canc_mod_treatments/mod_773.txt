She underwent successful splenic artery embolization on [**2187-10-9**] in order to reduce the operative risk of splenectomy and on [**10-10**] she underwent splenectomy.
She was brought back to the operating room for exploration of her wound and repair of gastric perforation.
Postoperatively she remained sedated and vented in the Surgical ICU.
