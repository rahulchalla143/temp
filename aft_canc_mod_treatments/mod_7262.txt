On most recent discharge on [**2195-10-6**], his UTI was initially treated with linezolid and zosyn.
He was discharged on Fosfomycin 3g Q48HRS for a total of 14 days (appears to have ended on [**10-20**]).
Following this course, he was instructed to resume taking Fosfomycin every 10 days, for prophylaxis.
He was given Vancomycin and just started getting 1L NS.
ED was planning on giving Levofloxacin IV given his Cefepime allergy, however they did not place a second IV, and so could only run 1 thing in at a time.

Brief Hospital Course: 85M with h/o CLL and many recent admissions to [**Hospital1 18**], recently for pneumonias (aspergillus and citrobacter) and recurrent UTIs (pseudomonas, VRE, E.coli), presenting from rehab facility with lethargy and fever, found to have pseudomonas bacteremia.
Initially patient was covered with linezolid, ciprofloxacin and meropenem (double coverage), given his urine culture history.
He was also initially administered stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone 100mg Q8h) given hypotension.
A blood culture from admission grew pseudomonas, sensitive to ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin (not [**Last Name (un) 2830**] or cefepime), and so antibiotics were switched to ceftazidime.
Linezolid was discontinued given thrombocytopenia.
Per the family discussion regarding goals of care (see below), patient was continued on antibiotics for a two-week course of ceftazidime to end on [**11-14**].
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Patient was initially transferred for urinary retention, however with placement of foley only minimal fluid was drained.
Creatinine continued to worsen through admission.
# Afib: This admission he was started on amiodarone for persistent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and often accompanied by low blood pressures.
He intermittently required a diltiazem drip for rate control despite this medication.
At the time of transfer from the ICU, he was in atrial fibrillation with blood pressures in the 80s but per discussion with the family (see below) no further medications were administered as this was not in keeping with his goals of care.
# CLL: Diagnosed in [**2180**] s/p multiple treatments most recently initiation of Campath, discontinued [**2195-2-9**].
Treatment is now focused on quality of life and per wife, she understands patient's prognosis is poor so goals of care are to continue current treatment but not to escalate care any further.
He was continued on his home regimen of Bactrim, Voriconazole and Valganciclovir for prophlaxis.
IV antibiotics were continued per the family's wishes, but oral medications were discontinued as his mental status declined, and focus was on comfort and symptom management.
