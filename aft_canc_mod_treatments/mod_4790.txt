there is compression of left lateral ventricle and third ventricle and dilation of the right lateral vent occipital and temporal horns c/w trapping.
no aneurysms identified  CT HEAD [**6-24**]: IMPRESSION: Status post excision of large extra-axial mass in the left frontal lobe, with remaining extensive mass effect and surrounding edema, similar compared to prior.
Post-surgical changes seen at the surgical bed with pneumocephalus and small amount of blood products.
Status post resection of the previously noted left frontal extra-axial mass, with post-surgical changes and small amount of blood products in the surgical resection bed.
Persistent mass effect, with subfalcine herniation and shift of the midline structures to the right side by 1.4 cm and mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.
Presence of blood products limits assessment of decreased diffusion/infarction.
