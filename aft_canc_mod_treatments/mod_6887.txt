After consultation with neurosurgery and radiation oncology, we believe that you do not need urgent surgery.
Instead, we will treat you with radiation therapy with the addition of dexamethasone.
We think that it is safe for you to go home but if you experience worsening of your symptoms, you should return to the emergency room.
We have made the following changes to your home medications: START dexamethasone 4mg tablet by mouth every 8hrs START MS contin 15mg by mouth every 12hrs Continue the rest of your home medications  Followup Instructions: Please follow up with radiation oncology for your appointment on Monday [**2149-4-21**]  Your primary oncologists, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]/[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] will set up a follow up appointment for you.
