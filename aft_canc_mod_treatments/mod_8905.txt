Zofran suspected to be causative [**Doctor Last Name 360**], with morphine and divalproex less likely.
(Patient has had at least 4 previous bouts of drug reactions, and has required intubation for laryngeal and angioedema).
Patient was given over 2 Liters of IV hydration in the ICU; hydration was stopped when IV access was lost.
Pain control was with IV morphine, but then switched to PO after IV access was lost.
She was given methyprednisolone 40mg IV once.
A right IJ was eventually placed for access.
She has required intubation in the past for respiratory decline in the setting of bullous hypersensitivity reaction.
Induction was with etomidate and succ, and sedation/pain control was maintained with midazolam and a morphine drip (to avoid further drug exposures).
Recurrent UTIs in this patient with urostomy due to spina bifida.
Patient was seen by her primary care physician who thought that because recent u/a was negative, patient was probably colonized with klebsiella and antibiotics were not warranted at this time.
If antibiotics are needed, patient can be started on meropenem.
Continued on divalproex 250mg PO BID per home regimen.
(6)  DEPRESSION:  Continued on citalopram 20mg PO daily and quetiapine 25mg PO QHS per home regimen.
