Status post right upper lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer.
Recommend correlation with prior exams once available and short-term followup if prior exams are not available.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 26075**] is a 58 y/o M with newly diagnosed rectal cancer s/p low anterior resection with end ileostomy whose intraoperative course was complicated by hypotension requiring continued intubation and care in the ICU.
He was reliant on pressors overnight but was weaned successfully and was maintaining good blood pressures within the next post-operative day.
By system: Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received Dilaudid IV/PCA, TAP blocks (Pain service), and ativan with good effect and adequate pain control.
When tolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.
CV: As mentioned earlier, the patient developed intraoperative hypotension requiring pressors and 5L of crystalloid and 1L of albumin but was weaned off them soon thereafter with some residual tachycardia with normal blood pressure that resolved with beta-blockade.
The patient was placed back on his metoprolol and while on the floor the subsequent few days, was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint with a HR in the 80s-90s and SBP within normal range.
He was extubated POD#1, and maintained good oxygen saturations on nasal cannula in the upper 90's as well as without additional O2 requirement upon discharge.
GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until tolerating oral intake.
He initially experienced some lower urine output POD #3 but responded soon afterwards with a combination of auto-diuresis and a one-time dose of furosemide.
His foley was removed on POD#4, with no retention issues.
Endo: The patient's blood glucose was initially in the 300s on POD#1, at which point he was started on lantus in the evening alongside his sliding scale of insulin.
He was discharged home on his oral diabetic medications.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible.
Other: given the nodularity of the patient's liver intra-operatively as well as his post-operative tachycardia, alcohol dependence and withdrawal was entertained as a factor.
However, the patient did not score significantly on his CIWA scale; he did not require any additional ativan besides that for his pain throughout his admission for withdrawal symptoms.
Discharge Medications: 1. tamsulosin 0.4 mg Capsule, Ext Release 24 hr Sig: One (1) Capsule, Ext Release 24 hr PO HS (at bedtime).
Disp:*90 Capsule, Ext Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2* 2. hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every four (4) hours as needed for pain for 7 days.
Disp:*40 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* 3. metoprolol tartrate 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day).
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day: Please take while using narcotics to avoid constipation.
You underwent a resection of your colon as well as creation of an ileostomy to allow your bowel to heal.
You initially had lower blood pressures than your normal pressures, which required some higher-level care and medications, but these were managed well.
This incision can be left open to air or covered with a dry sterile gauze dressing if the staples become irritated from clothing.
You may take Tylenol as recommended for pain.
Please do not take more than 4000mg of Tylenol daily.
Do not drink alcohol while taking narcotic pain medication or Tylenol.
Please do not drive a car while taking narcotic pain medication.
The most common complication from a new ileostomy placement is dehydration.
You must measure your ileostomy output for the next few weeks.
The office nurse or nurse practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the ileostomy output.
