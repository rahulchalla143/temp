Status post left temporal tumor resection with pneumocephalus and tiny blood products post-surgical at the surgical bed.
[**4-25**] MRI Brain (post op):IMPRESSION: Status post resection of left temporal and posterior frontal mass.
Vasogenic edema and blood products at the resection site appear stable.

The initial deficit was attributed to a temporary supplemental area syndrome.
The patient worked with case management trying to make a plan with regards to his insurance.
He was started on a heparin gtt with a bolus of 3000 units and then 1800 units/hr for a goal PTT of 60-100.
A head CT was done to evaluate for hemorrhage before heparin was initiated and showed stable postop findings.
Echocardiogram and EKG were ordered to evaluate for further clots and abnormalities, results as decribed in Pertinent Results section.
On [**5-1**] he continued on the heparin gtt with close monitoring of PTT and was trasitioned to Coumadin.
He received his first dose of Coumadin 5mg on [**5-1**], followed by 5mg on [**5-2**], and 3mg on [**5-3**].
Heparin gtt was stopped on [**5-3**] when his INR reached 3.0.
Coumadin was held on [**5-4**] for an INR of 3.5 and resumed on [**5-5**] at a dose of 2.5mg QHS.
His Coumadin was held again on [**5-6**] for an INR of 3.7 and [**5-7**] for an INR of 3.3.
His INR is likely impacted by the interaction between Dilantin and Coumadin and so on [**5-7**] a transition to Keprra 100mg [**Hospital1 **] was started.
Dilantin will need to be tapered over 4 days to off.
Dexamethasone taper was also started on [**5-7**] with a plan for a 2 week taper to off.
Please taper Dilantin to off over 4 days and Continue on Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] for Seizure prophylaxis.
Follow INR closely (daily) as Dilantin potentiates the effect of Coumadin and impacts the INR.
Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
You may wash your hair only after sutures and/or staples have been removed.
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and Ibuprofen etc.
You are tapering off of Dilantin and being transitioned to Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prevention.
You are on steroid medication which will taper to off over 2 weeks.
Make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Make sure to continue to use your incentive spirometer while at home.
Please call if you need to change your appointment, or require additional directions.
