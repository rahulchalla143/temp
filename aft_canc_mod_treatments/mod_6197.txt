Intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation, as seen on recent CT. Further evaluation with ERCP or MRCP is recommended.
- Spyglass cholangioscope showed large amount of mucin in CBD and no discrete lesion was found.
- Cytology samples were obtained for histology using a brush in the CBD.
- Because of the severely dilated CBD and large amount of mucin, a 5cm by 10FR double pig tail biliary stent was placed successfully in the CBD.
Then a 7cm by 10FR Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed side-by-side successfully in the CBD.
A left-sided central line is unchanged with tip in the low SVC.
Two previously placed biliary stents were seen at the major papilla.
One stent partially migrated distally.
Because patient developed obstruction with plastic stents and patient and family agreed with the metal stent placement, a 8cm by 10mm Wallflex fully covered biliary stent (Ref: 7054; Lot: [**Numeric Identifier 81030**]) was placed successfully in the CBD.
ERCP ([**10-12**]): Copious amount of mucin was seen at the major and minor papilla.
The previously placed FCSE metal stent was seen at the major papilla.
A straight tip .035in guidewire was placed.
Because of the copious amount of mucin causing obstruction, small amount of contrast was injected.
The patient was given prophylactic antibiotics with Zosyn prior to and immediately following the procedure.
On [**10-10**] she underwent repeat ERCP to replace the plastic stents with a metal stent, as the previous stent had slipped.
This did not successfully stay in place, and required replacement on [**10-12**].
The patient indicated prior to the ERCP that she would not wish to undertake therapy for any cancer found as a result of the procedure.
The patient may also prefer a comfort care/hospice approach.
She was successfully rate controlled with IV and PO metoprolol.
She was monitored and continued on beta blocker throughout her stay.
As her CHADS score is 3, she is a candidate for long-term anti-coagulation.
She will continue metoprolol for rate control.
She was in the ICU overnight and on pressors for roughly 8 hours.
She did not require ventilation report.
Following immediate management, she was maintained in NSR with metoprolol and had no recurrence of the hypotension.
On admission she was found to have some demand ischemia with troponin 0.4-0.5.

You came to our [**Hospital3 **] with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and jaundice.
For several days you needed additional oxygen support due to fluid in your lungs.
You were given medications to control your heart rate, keep your blood pressure in the normal range, and reduce any extra fluid in your body.
As these medications took effect, you were able to reduce your need for extra oxygen.
You required an additional ERCP on [**10-12**] to replace the stents once again.
Following this 3rd procedure the stent appeared to remain in place.
We made the following changes to your medications: STOP oxybutynin STOP Potassium Chloride (may restart depending on electrolyte monitoring) STOP tizanidine (may restart once liver function normalizes) STOP Zocor (may restart once liver function normalizes) .
INCREASE lisinopril from 5mg to 10mg daily for better blood pressure control .
