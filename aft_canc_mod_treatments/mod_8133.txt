The patient was initially started on chemotherapy in the ALL consortium trial but subsequently developed a dural venous sinus thrombosis on the right side on MRA/MRV imaging.
Neuro-Oncology was consulted and recommended heparinization and he was removed from the study at that point.
He was transitioned to Lovenox 80 mg SC Q12H on [**2138-7-10**].
During therapy, neutropenic fever was treated with empiric Cefepime, Vancomycin changed to Daptomycin, Micafungin and Metronidazole.
Culture data and imaging at that time was reassuring, however, there was some concern for a line infection and his central catheter was removed and the tip culture was negative.
He was re-admitted for hyperCVAD part B on [**2138-7-14**] and was discharged on [**2138-7-19**]; his only complication that admission was an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular reponse to the 130s, responsive to beta-blockers and without clear source.
The patient was assessed in clinic and was found to have low grade temperatures to the 99.5F range and tenderness in the peri-rectal area with radiation to the right groin in the setting of neutropenia (WBC 0.14, ANC 0 - 7% neutrophils and no bands) and he received IV Zosyn in clinic before admission.
He had ongoing rectal pain with some mild streaking on the toilet paper with bowel movements and pain with defecation that resolved following these BMs.

You were treated with IV antibiotics and for a time the infection had caused your blood pressure to be low which temporarily injured your kidneys so you were transferred to the ICU, and this has all since resolved after your counts returned to [**Location 213**].
Because you were so sick with your infection you will need to be on prophylactic (preventative) antibiotics after you leave (see below).
After your counts improved and you were looking well it was decided to start another round of your chemotherapy which you underwent and tolerated without problem.
