She denies any neurologic symptoms including numbness/tingling of arms or legs, slurring of speech, or facial asymmetry.
She does report some neck stiffness; she has been unsteady on her feet due to her "feet hurting."
She has not missed any of her medications per her report.
In the ED, she was initially started on a nipride gtt for BP 190/103.
She was then switched to nitroglycerin gtt with resultant BPs 140s-150s.
Labs in the ED demonstrated initial K of 6.3 and the patient was given insulin, D50, kayexalate, and calcium gluconate.
Cardiac enzymes were sent due to mild lateral ST segment depressions; CK was 30 with troponin 0.25 (no prior in our system).
She received morphine 2 mg X 2 for pain as well as aspirin 325 mg X 1. .
She was maintained on nitroglycerin gtt and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
Past Medical History: * Type I DM - since [**2098**] * ESRD on HD (MWF in [**Hospital1 789**]) * Pulmonary embolism on coumadin (diagnosed 1 month prior per patient) * Hypertension * Hyperlipidemia * Retinal detachment L eye * bilateral cataracts   Social History: The patient lives at home with her parents and younger sister.
Chest: HD tunnelled catheter in place over the right chest, nontender to palpation of tunnelled portion.
PARATHYROID SCAN: Following the intravenous injection of tracer, images of the neck including anterior, pinhole and marker views were obtained at 20 minutes.
A right subclavian hemodialysis catheter terminates in the right atrium.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: This is a 20 y/o F with ESRD secondary to type I DM on HD here with headache X 6 days.
# Hypertensive emergency:  The patient presented to ED with BP of 190s/100s and was initially started on a nitroprusside drip.
This was switched to a nitroglyercin drip in the ED due to her renal failure and concern for cyanide toxicity.
This was switched to labetolol on hospital day two and she was placed back on her home antihypertensive regimen of losartan and metoprolol on [**9-21**] and weaned off of the labetolol drip by [**9-22**] with blood pressures in the 140s to 150s systolic.
Given that her blood pressures appeared to be better controlled on labetalol her metoprolol was switched to labetalol at equal conversion.
She was discharged on labetalol, losartan, and nifedipine with good control of her blood pressure.
On presentation she was anticoagulated for pulmonary embolism with coumadin and her INR was elevated.
She received multiple units of FFP with difficulty in normalizing her INR.
She received zofran and compazine for nausea with good improvement.
She may well have a component of diabetic gastroparesis as well given her persistent nausea with PO intake.
The patient has not been getting erythropoetin at her dialysis sessions because of her hypertension.
This should be followed closely the next time she goes for hemodialysis with obvious concern for a line infection.
She received calcitonin initially for her hypercalcemia.
Her dose of cinacalcet was increased.
The patient was started on reglan PRN for nausea/vomiting, and nausea was subsequently controlled with no further need for antiemetics.
She was provided with a prescription for campazine as needed for nausea.
Patient requires dialysis MWF at home.
The patient was continued on Coumadin but held on occasion due to supratherapeutic INR.
This level should be followed at hemodialysis and Coumadin dose adjusted accordingly.
