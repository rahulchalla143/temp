Was evaluated by Neurosurgery and Neurology, and underwent emergent suboccipital decompression for hemorrhage.
Cardiac monitor revealed frequent PVCs, Cardiology was consulted, and home metoprolol was restarted.
He was initially treated with IV metoprolol and IV diltiazem, and later transitioned from metoprolol to oral diltiazem with improvement in HR control.
Work-up to assess for splenomegaly/splenic sequestation as a possible etiology included abdominal imaging that revealed hepatic cirrhosis with portal hypertension, at least 3 liver lesions c/w HCC, portal vein thrombosis, numerous varices, and mild splenomegaly.
As part of an infectious work-up, UA had been sent [**3-29**] which suggested active infection --> patient was started on empirical ceftriaxone while urine culture pending.
However, patient currently unable to take PO medications secondary to mental status, and he has pulled out a Dobhoff tube twice today.
Per discussion with family, decision was made to change code status to DNR/DNI and not escalate care, though they still want to see if patient will respond to lactulose and IVF for correction of hypernatremia.
sclera anicteric, slightly dry MM Neck: supple Lungs: coarse breath sounds bilaterally with transmitted upper airway sounds, rales right base, no wheezing CV: tacycardia with occassional ectopic beats, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: sommnulant, responseive to noxious stimulation, moving all four extremities; not cooperative and not following commands     Pertinent Results: Head CT [**2151-3-24**] R cerebellar hemorrhage measuring 5cm with surrounding vasogenic edema  NCHCT [**2151-3-24**] Post op Right suboccipital craniectomy and partial cerebellar hematoma evacuation.
Residual cerebellar parenchymal, subdural, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Echo [**3-29**] Mildly dilated LA, RA; no significant valvular disease, EF >60%  CXR [**3-29**] Bibasilar pneumonia vs atelectasis, small R subpneumonic pleural effusion  Abd US [**3-29**] Cirrhotic liver w/3 masses ?HCC, splenic varices suggestive of portal HTN, borderline splenomegaly  Abd/Chest CT [**3-29**] Multiple liver lesions c/w HCC, cirrhosis w/small volume ascites, splenic/paraesophageal varices, thrombosed portal vein, borderline splenomegaly, cystic lesion in/near pancreatic head, possible calcified splenic artery aneurysm, b/l simple renal cysts, diverticulosis   Brief Hospital Course: 81 y/o with history of cerebellar hemorrhage in [**2149**] presents with complaint of headache found to have right cerebellar hemorrhage s/p evacuation with hospital course complicated by altered mental status, as well identification of hepatic lesions consisent with malignancy (primary multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma vs metastatic cholangiocarcinoma/pancreatic carcinoma) ultimately transferred to MICU for increasing respiratory distress.
In the MICU patient aggresively diuresised for any potential contribution from volume overload and antibiotics started for probable aspiration.
Patient was placed on morphine gtt and passed away peacefully with family at the bedside.
