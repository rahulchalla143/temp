He went to an outside hospital, where he was noted to have a temperature of 99.2 F, heart rate of 106, oxygen saturation of 89% on 2 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula and subsequently 92% on 6 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula, and a blood pressure of 53/31.
He was given dexamethasone 4 mg IV x 1, 2 liters of IV fluids, and then transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**].
He was given ceftriaxone and metronidazole, as well as 100 mg of hydrocortisone intravenously.
The patient was started on low dose dopamine for his hypotension and was transferred to the MICU.
Although, the initial of anticoagulation was considered due to this finding, it was held initially because the patient reported bright red blood per rectum for several days prior to admission, and also because of his history of brain metastases.
Because of the brain metastases, a neurosurgery consult was requested prior to the initiation of Heparin drip.
Non-small cell lung cancer complicated by left frontal brain metastases status post resection on [**2190-3-16**].
Dexamethasone 2 mg po q day.
Phenytoin 100 mg po tid.
Lansoprazole 30 mg po q day.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial physical examination, the patient's temperature was 102.7 F, heart rate 104, blood pressure 97/53, respiratory rate 24, and oxygen saturation was 90% on 100% non-rebreather face mask.
He had diffuse rhonchi on pulmonary auscultation with expiratory wheezes.
His abdomen was soft, non-tender, non-distended, and there were normoactive bowel sounds.
An empiric trial of diuresis was therefore attempted; while the patient had increased urine output with this attempt, his dyspnea and hypoxemia did not improve.
He was also covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics including levofloxacin and metronidazole on admission for empiric coverage of a possible infectious process given his admission with fever and hypotension.
He was initially treated with stress dosed steroids.
These steroids were rapidly tapered down his admission dose of dexamethasone; he was subsequently restarted on stress-dosed steroids when he later developed an episode of adrenal insufficiency as noted below.
The patient was discharged with plans for a very gradual steroid taper, as well as continued use of oxygen initially at rehabilitation and subsequently at home.
Low dose dopamine was utilized to maintain normotension during the first two days of his admission in the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient's blood pressure subsequently normalized, and he did not require further administration of pressors during this hospitalization.
He did subsequently develop a second episode of hypotension as noted above; however, this episode was attributed to adrenal insufficiency, and his hypotension resolved with administration of stress dosed steroids.
His antibiotic coverage was at that time broaden to include Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole in order to provide empiric coverage for a possible Intensive Care Unit acquired pneumonia.
On [**2190-5-17**], the patient's systolic blood pressure dropped into the 80's; his blood pressure normalized with the administration of an IV fluid bolus.
Because of this finding, the patient was initiated again on stress dose steroids with subsequent relatively rapid improvement in his clinical status.
Of note, the patient may have been taking 8 mg of dexamethasone daily prior to his admission to the hospital, not 2 mg daily, as was initially thought to his admission to the hospital.
He therefore may not been receiving adequate steroid supplementation following his first transfer out of the Intensive Care Unit.
Following treatment with high dose steroids, the patient's clinical status improved dramatically.
The patient was therefore discharged home with plans for a very gradual steroid taper as noted below.
The consensus opinion as that, given the patient's significant underlying emphysema and his generally poor overall functional capacity, that the patient was not an ideal candidate for surgical resection of his lung mass.
Any further decisions regarding the appropriate management of his lung tumor, including possible radiation therapy or chemotherapy, will be made once the patient's clinical status stabilizes.
He will follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 3274**] in the Medical [**Hospital **] Clinic in the future for further management of this issue.
Right upper quadrant deep venous thrombosis:  On [**2190-5-14**], prior to the patient's first transfer out of the Intensive Care Unit, he was noted to have a right upper extremity deep venous thrombosis around a central venous catheter that had been inserted in the Intensive Care Unit.
This catheter was removed, and the patient was started on a heparin drip.
He therefore, will be discharged on a warfarin regimen as noted below, but will need careful monitoring including initial daily monitoring of his INR following discharge from the hospital.
The patient did receive a total of 11 days of antibiotics for empiric coverage and fever and hypotension given his intermittently for clear appearance.
His antibiotics were discontinued on [**5-21**], and he remained afebrile without any clinically apparent source of infection throughout the remainder of his hospitalization.
Prednisone taper as follows:  60 mg po q day through [**2190-5-25**], 50 mg po q day from [**2190-5-26**] through [**2190-6-1**], 40 mg po q day from [**2190-6-2**] through [**2190-6-8**], 30 mg po q day from [**2190-6-9**] through [**2190-6-15**], 20 mg po q day from [**2190-6-16**] through [**2190-6-22**], 10 mg po q day from [**2190-6-23**] through [**2190-6-29**], then 5 mg po q day from [**2190-6-30**] through [**2190-7-6**].
