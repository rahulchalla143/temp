He was given intravenous fluids and diltiazem AV and was started on intravenous heparin because of an elevated troponin of 4.3.
He was then treated with digoxin without effect and then Lopressor intravenously which caused him to become hypotensive.
Spontaneous cardioversion was achieved following an amiodarone drip being started.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction 20 years ago.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Atenolol 100, Lisinopril, glyburide, Glucophage, Plavix, aspirin, terazosin and Lipitor.
He was started on a heparin drip with a 6500 unit bolus.
He was also on amiodarone 150 intravenously.
LABS ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 17.7 with a differential including 58 monocytes and 6 blasts.
In general, this is an 83-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy who presented in rapid atrial fibrillation, complicated by hypotension, requiring intubation, status post failed electrical cardioversion with spontaneous resolution to sinus rhythm and stabilization of heart rate and blood pressure on dopamine.
Amiodarone was discontinued.
Oncologic:  With myocytes and blasts on CBC and evidence of extensive bleeding at venipuncture sites, there was concern for TTP or DIC.
They recommended platelet transfusion if evidence of bleeding.
Later that evening, Medical Team had an extensive conversation with [**Doctor First Name **] Gaffin, the daughter of Mr.  [**Known lastname **], who expressed her fathers wishes to not have any heroic measures including defibrillation and mechanical ventilation.
He was not requiring the ventilator for respiratory support and he was extubated.
