Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old man with a past medical history signficant for chronic kidney disease, hypertension, prostate cancer s/p XRT, and type [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 11916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8813**] dissection (dxed [**2114**]) transferred from outside hospital for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
Upon transfer patient required escalating oxygen support and was intubated for both hypoxia and to facilitate workup of dissection.
Following extubation patient was transferred to the medical floor where he required intensive titration of blood pressure medications to maintain goal SBP <130 although BPs on the floor were 120-160.
Medications were uptitrated and patient was discharged on a regimen of max dose labetalol, clonidine 0.2 mg TID, amlodipine 10, and hydralazine 75mg TID.
On follow up could consider uptitratring clonidine or hydral or starting diltiazem for better BP control if needed.
Lasix 20mg po daily was started for chronic diastolic CHF as well.
His elevated creatinine was felt to be related to malignant hypertension and improved with treatment of blood pressure and CHF.
Addition, of these medications could be considered in the future once renal function returns to baseline.
His antibiotics which were empirically started in the ED (Rocephin/Azithromycin) were discontinued.
Medication Changes: -Increased labetalol to 800mg TID -Increased Amlodipine to 10mg QD -Started Lasix 20mg PO QD -Held allopurinol in the setting of his acute renal failure.
Home VNA has been arranged for the patient to help with his medications and blood pressure measurements.
His blood pressure medication will likely require titration in the future to achieve these goals.
Since the patient was started on lasix during this hospitalization, we recommend drawing a chem 10 in one week to check for electrolyte abnormalities and renal function.
