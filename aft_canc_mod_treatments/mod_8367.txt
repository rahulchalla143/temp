After 685cc sanguinous fluid was removed RA pressure was 4, pericardial pressure was 4.
Patient complained of [**7-8**] left shoulder pain following drain, better with movement, given 75ucg of fentanyl with some relief.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
