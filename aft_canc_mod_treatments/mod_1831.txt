Multiple suspects including diverticulosis, gastric polyp, internal hemorrhoids and gastric ulcer.
The patient had negative esophagogastroduodenoscopy, negative colonoscopy except for diverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids.
He had one liter of IVF and mesenteric angiography which was negative.
He was transfused two units packed red blood cells, hematocrit then stabilized.
In the MICU he did have melanotic stool but hematocrit remained stable and was then transferred to the Medicine floor for further management.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diverticulosis, internal hemorrhoids, multiple gastrointestinal bleeds that self-resolved, gastric polyp and shallow gastric ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hiatal hernia, hypertension, status post transurethral resection of prostate, status post bilateral inguinal hernia repair, hypercholesterolemia, hyperhomocystinemia.

Vitamin B12.
ALLERGIES:  Ampicillin and Gentamicin which cause rash.
During his transfer to the Medicine service the patient had continued blood per rectum times 3 or 4 times.
Surgery was consulted on the patient and felt that one option included a Heparin induced bleeding in order to appreciate the source of the bleeding.
This was planned however, the patient's bleeding spontaneously resolved and hence patient was not taken to the operating room for Heparin induced bleeding.
The patient then did have some blood per rectum and a tagged red blood cell scan was performed on [**8-11**] however, this did not reveal the source of bleeding either so again it is felt that perhaps a Heparin induced bleeding scan was the best course of action for this patient however, as stated above the bleeding then spontaneously resolved and the patient had no further episode of bright red blood per rectum and he had a stable hematocrit.
