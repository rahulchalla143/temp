Admission Date:  [**2122-4-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-4-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2082-7-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Amoxicillin / Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Bactrim / Iodine; Iodine Containing / Abciximab  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: STEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 39F with AML s/p [**First Name3 (LF) 3242**] complicated by GVHD, h/o CAD s/p DES to LAD and BMS to D1 in [**11-16**], who awoke from sleep with acute onset of SSCP.
In the ED she received 5mg IV Lopressor and 600mg [**Hospital1 **].
Thrombectomy and stenting with BMS were performed, and she was transferred to the CCU for further monitoring.
She has been on coumadin for DVTs but has been very sensitive to her dose.
She was also recently treated for presumed C. diff.
AML: diagnosed [**4-14**] s/p allo-related SCT [**10-14**] (sister was donor) Cytoxan/MTX/TBI.
Ankle fracture in left ankle s/p surgical repair [**8-17**] 6.
Migraine headaches 9.
Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue revealed subcutaneous induration from Lovenox injections.
Successful stenting of the distal LCX (bare metal).
Successful stenting of the proximal LCX (bare metal .
The LAD had an ostial 70% before the stent and 40% stenoses in the D1 origin and proximal segments.
The patient was subsequently started on pressors and transfused with blood and the left sided filling pressures rose (mean PCW pressure increased to 18 mm Hg).
Systemic arterial pressures were normal on pressors (aortic pressure was 130/8 mm Hg).
Successful thrombectomy and balloon angiplasty of the LCx with a 2.5 balloon and a 3.25 NC balloon in the proximal stent.
However hypercoagulable state complicated the procedure with recurrentpatent stent sites in the proximal and distal LCX with a possible cut off of the distal LPL secondary to embolization.
Responded to volume resusciatation with blood and vasopressor agents.
Prolonged manual compression at left groin access site (2.5 hrs), followed by Femstop to maintain hemostasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 39F w/ h/o AML s/p [**Month/Day/Year 3242**] complicated by GVHD, h/o CAD s/p STEMI and PCI to LAD and D1 in [**11-16**], presents with STEMI and found to have LCX disease in setting of subtherapeutic INR.
TTE revealed EF 30% which was significantly depressed from prior Echo reports.
Abciximab was started in addition to bivalirudin in light of continued clot formation.
Post cath, her platelets were noted to be 197 (from 580's before), there was concern for HIT-T (in setting of having been on Lovenox) and she was started on argatroban gtt.
Apoliprotein A nl; B2 glycoprotein was pending at time of discharge.
She was discharged with Lovenox 60 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **].
Other cardiac meds on discharge include [**Hospital1 **] 75 mg [**Hospital1 **] (given tendency to clot), [**Hospital1 **] 325, Toprol XL 100 [**Hospital1 **], Lisinopril 5 QD, Crestor 40 QD, Lasix 40 QD.
This was felt to be multifactorial (gut GVHD, poor access and difficult blood draws for INR checks).
Patient had been on lovenox as well as coumadin in the past.
At this admission, it was felt that she should be anticoagulated with Lovenox and then follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] as noted above.
Post-cath, she remained hemodynamically stable, but still required an additional 3U PRBC's over the next 3 days to maintain HCT >28.
By discharge, her blood pressures were controlled in SBP 120-140's with Toprol XL 100 [**Hospital1 **], Lisinopril 5 QD, and her Hct was 36.8. .
Patient and her husband will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] upon discharge for further treatment and will also discuss anticoagulation with Lovenox.
2) Heme: Pt instructed to f/u with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] regarding heme work-up, further immunosuppressant therapy, and long-term anticoagulation with Lovenox .
