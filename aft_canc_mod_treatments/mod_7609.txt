# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure -The patient's initial CXR showed interval development of pulmonary edema in the setting of global myocardial hypokinesis and fluid resuscitation (2L).
Patient was initially placed on BIPAP and she was found to be fluid overloaded on imaging.
She was initially on neosynephrine then changed to levophed and by HD2 was weaned off pressors completely.
She was satting in the high 90s on 3L NC before transfer to the floor.
Upon transfer, she improved without further diuresis needs and upon discharge was on room air without signs of volume overload.
Cardiology recommendations were to continue the full dose aspirin and patient did not require further antiplatelet/anticoagulation.
She was initially felt to have had a seizure by the MICU team, and lacosamide was started per recommendations of Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 60181**] (her neuro-onc).
Upon discharge, her counts were beginning to recover well, without requiring transfusions for support.

Likely due to low blood pressure after the fall, you went into cardiogenic shock, which is to say that your heart was not functioning normally and you required medications to help it pump effectively.
We started some new medications for your heart.
Please note the following new medications:  START Colace 100mg by mouth twice per day Senna 1 tab by mouth twice per day Miralax 17g packet by mouth once per day as needed for constipation Aspirin 81mg by mouth once per day Toprol XL 50mg by mouth once per day  Otherwise please stop taking your previous medications (cipro, fluconazole, acyclovir) as you no longer need these for low blood counts.
