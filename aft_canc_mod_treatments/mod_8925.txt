HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60 year-old female with history of non-small cell carcinoma status post right pneumonectomy whose course has been complicated by bronchopleural fistula and empyema.
She was admitted for rigid bronchoscopy on [**2197-11-21**].
The stent was removed and the 2 mm right bronchopleural fistula was covered with fibrin glue.
Following the procedure she continued with secretions and shortness of breath and was ultimately intubated and transferred to the MICU on [**2197-11-22**].
Status post chemotherapy, status post radiation therapy, status post right pneumonectomy five to six years ago.
Left main stem stent for bronchopleural fistula and stenosis in [**2197-5-5**].
Status post right oophorectomy.
Percocet prn.
Ceftazidine and Vancomycin were started to treat a questionable pneumonia / bronchitis.
She maintained adequate oxygenation and ventilation throughout her hospital course.
She would become hypertensive, tachypneic and red in the face when her pressure support was weaned off.
Given the clear inability to extubate Mrs. [**Known lastname **] despite medical authorization attention was focused on disposition.
She contemplated an extubation trial in the setting of a do not intubate order versus tracheostomy and long term care facility placement possibly a Hospice setting.
On [**12-7**] she elected to proceed with tracheostomy placement.
Ultimately on [**12-10**] with her breathing still uncomfortable and worsening secondary to increase need for sedating medications she was moved to comfort measures only status.
She was started on Morphine drip for comfort and the ventilator withdrawn.
Off ventilator despite supplemental oxygen her O2 saturations rapidly dropped to the 60s.
Of note her hospital course was further complicated by an episode of coffee-grounds in her NG aspirated on [**11-24**].
She dropped her hematocrit to the low 20s and was transfused 3 units of packed red blood cells.
EGU was performed which showed esophagitis and linear ulcerations in the stomach consistent with NG tube trauma.
