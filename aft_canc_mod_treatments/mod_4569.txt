Patient did have 2 episodes of mild BRBPR while on the floor with bowel movements thought to be secondary to hemorrhoids and straining with bowel movements.
Started on bowel regimen including colace, fiber, and senna PRN.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Initially elevated HR to 160s, treated with fluids and esmolol drip in ICU.
Weaned to home medications of metoprolol and diltiazem.
Patient was tachycardic with ambulation so metoprolol was increased to 75mg TID.
# Urinary Retention: Initial attempt at foley insertion was unsuccessful and caused bleeding from urethral meatus.
Foley was removed 3 days prior to d/c, however patient was having frequent small voids thought to be overflow.
A post void bladder scan revealed 950cc of urine so Urology replaced foley.
Dishcarged with foley in place and started on tamsulosin with Urology follow-up.
Oncology was consulted and recommended degarelix which patient received while in house.
# Psoriasis - Did flare while in hospital, but resolved once patient applied home steroid ointment.

We started you an a bowel regimen which should soften your stool and help you move your bowels without straining.
We do not think that you need to be on coumadin for your atrial fibrillation as you are low risk for a stroke.
You are going home with a foley as we did a post void bladder scan which showed 950cc of urine in your bladder.
We made the following changes to your medication: STOPPED Coumadin  INCREASED Metoprolol to 75mg TID  STARTED Colace 100mg by mouth twice daily Tamsulosin 0.4mg by mouth nightly  Please eat a high fiber diet, including adding Metamucil, three times a day.
