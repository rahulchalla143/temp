He is admitted now for management of multiple issues.
Ultimately, decision made to pursue PEG tube, followed by teeth extraction (very poor dentition) followed by radiation treatment and Erbitux.
He was seen in the [**Hospital **] clinic today for planned PEG tube but GI unable to place due to concern for compromising airway with sedation.
He is admitted for ongoing management.
He was given vancomycin on [**5-17**] at dialysis.
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Failure to Thrive Coronary Artery Disease s/p MI in [**2149**] and CABG in [**2165**] Right Eye Blindness GERD End Stage Renal Disease on HD (qMWF at [**University/College **] Dialysis Center) Alcohol Abuse Sqaumous Cell Carcinoma of head and neck  Social History: Lives with daughter [**Name (NI) 1139**]: 2 PPD EtOH: previous history of alcohol use, pt denies recent use Drugs: denies Per patient's dialysis nurse ([**Doctor First Name **]), he has been very depressed since his wife passed away several years ago.
General Appearance: cachectic, yellow bronze skin tone, NAD, non toxic Eyes:  EOMI, no conjuctival injection, anicteric ENT:  MMdry, poor dentition, palpable posterior cerv lymph node Respiratory: CTA b/l with good air movement throughout Cardiovascular: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, +2/6 systolic murmur Gastrointestinal: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, scaphoid Musculoskeletal/extremities: no edema Skin/nails: warm, no rashes/yellowish skin tone Neurological: AAOx3.
The patient is status post CABG procedure with multiple well aligned sternotomy wires and surgical clips.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial imaging was performed through the chest without administration of IV contrast.
A feeding tube terminates in the pylorus.
The patient is status post CABG and median sternotomy.
1)Bacteremia/endocarditis 2)Squamous Cell Carcinoma of pharynyx 3)Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, consistent with aspiration pneumonia 4)DM1 with complications and poorly controlled 5)CKD stage V on hemodialysis 6)Anemia chronic kidney disease 7)hypertension, well controlled on current medications 8)malnutrition -- at goal on tube feeds 9)hypothyroidism   During hospitalization, pt.
had extraction of all teeth, and surgical placement of gastrostomy tube.
Had been given dose of vanc [**5-18**] at dialysis.
Dental extractions performed as presumed source of endocarditis.
This means that course of vancomycin would be completed on [**6-26**].
Plan is 3 weeks of vancomycin prior to initiation of chemo/XRT to allow appropriate bacteria clearance in addition to adequate mucosal healing in mouth.
Radiation evaluated him for treatment of squamous cell carcinoma and completed mapping, with plan for first treatment on [**6-11**].
will undergo adjuvant chemo with Erbitux, first administered [**6-5**] at [**Hospital1 18**] with subsequent doses to be administered after discharge to [**Hospital1 **] with coordination with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] ([**Hospital1 18**] oncologist).
For pulmonary infiltrates, received chest CT on [**5-23**] which demonstrated interval improvement and no clear evidence of septic emboli, and initially received azithromycin for coverage of atypical organisms completed, along with vancomycin, as above.
aspirated after vomiting, and developed a new lll infiltrate consistent with pneumonitis, and required high flow oxygen to maintain oxygen sats in the 90s subsequent to this.
His antibiotics were expanded to vanc/cipro/flagyl.
He was sent back to the floor the following day ([**5-29**]) as his oxygenation improved (90's on two litres nasal cannula, which he would not keep on, thus requiring restraint).
Olanzapine was started for agitation.
Swallow evaluation [**6-5**] showed silent aspiration but with counseling and observation he tolerated soft foods and thin liquids.
On [**6-6**], the morning after receiving dexamethasone premedication for erbitux, he developed severe hyperglycemia, unresponsive to large doses of SC insulin.
Since that time his sugars have remained in relatively good control, with a bedtime dose of glargine 14 u and insulin by sliding scale.
He continued to receive dialysis which was well tolerated.
On [**6-11**] he received his first radiation therapy treatment, with plans to return for daily treatments.
