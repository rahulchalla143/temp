Today, he was intubated for airway protection given his habitus prior to procedure.
Initial intubation was difficult due to habitus.
On extubation, he wasn't ventilating well with elevated end tidal CO2 despite 30-45 min of Ambu ventilation and was reintubated with difficulty.
He subsequently went into PEA arrest and received 2 doses of epinephrine with ROSC.

[**2122-12-12**] PLEURAL FLUID    GRAM STAIN (Final [**2122-12-12**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE PREPARATION (Final [**2122-12-13**]):       Test cancelled by laboratory.
Yet in another site in the biopsy, there are numerous epithelioid cells with abundant pink cytoplasm which are positive for cytokeratin and suggestive of reactive mesothelial cells.
CD45 stains most of the cells given the impression of staining more cells than accounted for by the combined CD20, CD30 and CD3 stained cells.
Increased bilateral pulmonary opacities, likely representing post-obstructive pneumonitis/aspiration, atelectasis, infection, and/or hemorrhage.
[**12-11**] CXR: Endotracheal tube ends approximately 2.5 cm above the carina.
Left internal jugular line ends at mid SVC.
Endotracheal tube terminates 2.53 cm above the carina.
Consider retracting ET tube by additional 2 cm for more standard position.
[**12-5**] PET CT: Extensive FDG-avid disease in the left cervical nodes, mediastinum, right axilla, abdomen, pelvis and bony skeleton.
[**12-14**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated.
Brief Hospital Course: 27M with recently discovered diffuse lymphadenopathy/Hodgkin's lymphoma and polysubstance abuse, who presented for elective R axillary LN dissection and subsequently developed respiratory failure and VF and PEA arrests, now with return of spontaneous circulation.
This may have been aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis given multiple intubation attempts.
RLL pleural effusion was tapped [**12-12**] evening and drained over 1 liter and pigtail catheter was able to be removed [**12-14**].
He was initially treated with Zosyn and Vanco for presumed aspiration pneumonia, planned 8 day course started [**2122-12-11**], but was transitioned to levoquin to complete a 7-day course.
The patients ejection fraction was noted to be depressed to 40% consistent with myocardial stunning from cardiac arrest but later normalized to 55% on repeat echocardiography.
Pt was seen by electrophysiology who felt there was no current indication for ICD placement or further investigation.
He started modified ABVD (no bleomycin given his recent pulmonary issues) on [**12-13**].
He was started on methylprednisolone 100mg IV q24 for 5 days (day 1 = [**12-11**]) and was transitioned to an oral prednisone taper the day of discharge.
He was put on allopurinol for prevention of tumor lysis, adn this was discontinued upon discharge.
Patient had frequent desaturations to 80s at night.

After the surgery you were having trouble breathing and your heart stopped beating completely.
This was most likely because the mass in your chest was putting pressure on your airway and on your heart.
Fortunately you were able to be resuscitated and a tube was placed to help you breathe while you recovered.
The breathing tube was able to be removed 2 days later.
You were then immediately started on treatment for your lymphoma with chemotherapy.
