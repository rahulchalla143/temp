Admission Date:  [**2157-1-3**]     Discharge Date:  [**2157-1-11**]   Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80 year-old female from [**Hospital3 **] facility with a past medical history significant for hypertension, congestive heart failure (last ejection fraction in [**2149**] of 35%), atrial fibrillation on Coumadin and rate control with beta blocker, history of multiple transient ischemic attacks and two cerebrovascular accidents with a recent admission to [**Hospital1 190**] for a gastrointestinal bleed from a colonic AVM status post cauterization who presents to the Emergency Department three days after discharge from the hospital on Coumadin and Lasix with a recurrence of bright red blood per rectum.
During previous hospitalization from [**12-22**] to [**12-30**] the patient was treated with multiple units of packed red blood cells, had episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and underwent endoscopy and colonoscopy.
During the hospitalization her Coumadin was discontinued and she was placed on heparin.
However, on discharge given her increased risk for cerebrovascular accident off of anticoagulation she was discharged on Coumadin with a Lovenox bridge.
Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin and Metoprolol.
Questionable malt lymphoma on recent gastric biopsy.
ALLERGIES:  Quinidine and quinine.
Pantoprazole 40 b.i.d.
Metoprolol 100 b.i.d.
Gastrointestinal bleed:  The patient is admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at which time she received vitamin K, 5 units of fresh frozen platelets and 6 units of packed red blood cells to keep her hematocrit stable.
The patient continued on Pantoprazole 40 mg twice a day, which was transitioned to once a day prior to discharge.
On admission her Lovenox was discontinued and her Coumadin was held.
However, prior to discharge the patient was started on low dose Coumadin given her increase for cerebrovascular accident and she had no further bleeding.
Initially her beta blocker was held, but restarted prior to admission to the floor.
Hypertension:  Given the patient's gastrointestinal bleed her beta blocker and ace inhibitor were held.
Prior to admission to the floor her beta blocker was reinstated and her ace inhibitor was reinstated one day later.
History of cerebrovascular accidents:  During hospitalization the patient had an episode of acute onset of numbness and paresthesias in the left lower extremities associated with transient weakness.
Given evidence of the patient's hypercoagulability off of anticoagulation she was restarted on Coumadin at a lower dose then she was previously on without bridging heparin or Lovenox.
FEN:  The patient had to be repleted with magnesium multiple times, therefore she is being discharged on magnesium supplementation to be followed as an outpatient.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable without recurrence of gastrointestinal bleed, hemodynamically stable, hematocrit stable around 30, tolerating po diet, walking with a steady gait occasional with a cane and with an INR of 1.2.
History of falls walks with a cane in the right hand at baseline.
