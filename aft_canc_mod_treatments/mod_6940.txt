Soft tissue seen in the presacral region, may represent post surgical/radiation fibrosis, but recurrent tumor not excluded.
CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast ([**2143-12-15**])- Multiple loops of fluid-filled dilated small bowel, slighty progressed since the [**2143-12-9**] examination, tapering somewhat near an area of surgical scar/remnant tissue at the rectal bed, concerning for partial small bowel obstruction secondary to presacral soft tissue to which the bowel appears adherent.
This tissue may be due to prior post-operative change and radiation fibrosis although recurrent tumor is not excluded.

A RIJ CVC was placed in the ED.
She was volume resuscitated with about 10 L of normal saline and lactated ringers over 16 hours.
Initially, she required a low dose levophed drip but this was weaned over the course of 12 hours.
Based on her blood pressures and renal function at follow up, her Lisinopril could be restarted at PCP follow up visit.
#Diarrhea: Acute infectious gastroenteritis was  suspected initially and patient was started empirically on ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.
With finding of blood in stool and hematocrit drop (see below),  it is possible that increased output from ostomy was secondary to the cathartic effects of blood, and once acute bleed stopped, output slowed.
Patient was discharged to complete an additional 5 days of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole and outpatient gastroenterology appointment scheduled.
#Probable acute blood loss anemia: Patient had a hematocrit drop from last ED visit on [**2143-12-9**] (36.8) to [**2143-12-15**] (33.8) and dropped even further with fluid resuscitation to 27.0.
#Hyperkalemia: Initially 6.1 and improved to 4.7 with volume resucitation as her prerenal azotemia improved.
#Hypertension: As above, patient initially hypotensive, then normotensive following volume resuscitation.
Home lisinopril 20mg daily held at the time of discharge given normal blood pressure and recent acute kidney injury with plan for patient to restart at the discretion of PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] appointment.
#Hypercholesterolemia: Patient continued on home atorvastatin and aspirin.
#Bilateral knee osteoarthritis: Patient continued on home acetaminophen prn.
#Peripheral neuropathy secondary to spondylosis: Dose adjusted for renal failure initially, then changed back to home dose gabapentin 200mg TID prior to discharge.
#GERD: Patient on pantoprazole 40mg daily at home.
With findings of gastritis on EGD, pantoprazole was increased to 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
#Anxiety: Continued home lorazepam 1mg as needed daily -lorazepam 1mg po prn daily .

Ulcerative colitis s/p colectomy   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Because of the large volume loss, your blood pressure was very low, and you were briefly in the ICU for medications and fluids to help bring your blood pressure up.
Please continue these medications for two more days.
You will need to follow-up with the GI doctors regarding results of these biopsies and the blood in your stool.
MEDICATION CHANGES: - continue ciprofloxacin through [**2143-12-20**] - continue metronidazole through [**2143-12-20**] - INCREASE protonix to TWICE daily - HOLD lisinopril until you follow-up with your primary care doctor CONTINUE THE REST OF YOUR HOME MEDICATIONS WITHOUT CHANGES  Be sure to avoid NSAIDs (ibuprofen, advil, motrin) as these medication irritate your stomach.
