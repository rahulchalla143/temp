Past Medical History: DM HTN CAD- s/p CABG x 2 (LIMA-Diag, SVG-ramus then jump to OM, SVG-acute marginal then jump to rPDA) CHF- EF 20% s/p A flutter ablation s/p pacemaker (attempted BiV but only 1 lead placed) NSVT- s/p ICD [**9-28**] Multiple myeloma diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy in [**Month (only) 956**] [**2198**] with treatments including: Thalidomide, Methylprednisone, Melphalan.
Now on Procrit and pulse dose decadron- last pulse in [**Month (only) 216**].
CRI (recent Cr 2.6) Prostate cancer, status post radiation therapy.
Bladder cancer, status post BCG instillation.
Given his other medical issues, Mr. [**Known lastname 45794**] was initially treated with melphalan and prednisone, but this was complicated by low counts and poor tolerance.
He also took thalidomide for a period of time but he had increased dizziness and did not tolerate this well.
Because of his other medical issues, which were often exacerbated with treatment for his myeloma, he often was monitored by laboratory values and treated symptomatically for his myeloma.
He has been receiving Procrit for chronic anemia with periodic transfusions in order to maintain his hematocrit 28-30% due to his cardiac history.
During the admission, he was found to have new lytic lesions in the hip and back and was treated with radiation therapy to the hip and back area along with a pulse of Decadron.
His last treatment (until this week) for his myeloma was with a 3-day pulse of melphalan at 10 mg daily starting on [**2201-10-12**].
Mr [**Known lastname 45798**] wife who had undergone bilateral knee replacements last year, fell recently and shattered her femur.
