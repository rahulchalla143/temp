Her course was also complicated by the onset of new atrial fibrillation, for which she was treated with diltiazem and sent over on an IV amiodarone load.
She also was hyponatremic and was fluid restricted for presumed SIADH, and started on sodium tabs.

Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 4318**] is a 60 year-old female with long-standing smoking history with newly diagnosed lung mass obstructing LUL with consequent collapse, transferred initially to MICU, then floor for further work-up and care.
She underwent a rigid bronchoscopy on [**11-12**], with findings significant for tumor infiltration of the submucosa in left mainstem bronchus, with LUL/lingula completely obstructed.
She tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.
She also has a history of COPD, and was initially placed on a higher dose of Prednisone 40 mg PO QD for possible COPD exacerbation upon admission to the MICU.
COPD was ultimately not felt to be an important contributor, and quick Prednisone taper was initiated.
We contact[**Name (NI) **] the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] indicated that she is on chronic low dose Prednisone 10 mg PO QD.
Continue supportive care with nebulizers prn, MDIs.
4) Atrial fibrillation: She was loaded on amiodarone IV at the OSH, completed at [**Hospital1 18**].
She was subsequently placed on Amiodarone 200 mg PO TID.
she was also on a Diltiazem drip at the OSH, converted to Verapamil upon transfer.
She reverted to NSR while in the ICU on [**11-10**], then back in afib on [**11-11**] with RVR with HR in 140s, and borderline low BP.
She was given Diltiazem push IV X 3 doses, then Verapamil was changed to Diltiazem 60 mg PO QID for easier titration.
Amiodarone was also increased to 400 mg PO TID.
She is back on 200 mg PO TID, and should continue this dose X 1 week ([**11-20**]), then decrease to 200 mg PO BID X 1 week, then daily thereafter.
She is back on Verapamil 120 mg PO Q 12 hours.
Decision was made not to anticoagulate given her lung mass and concern over friability/bleeding.
She currently remains in NSR, and per discussion with attending, no anticoagulation at present.
Of note, we have been avoiding Albuterol nebulizers to prevent med-induced tachycardia.
Her sodium has improved in the hospital with fluid restriction 1200 cc/day.
Lasix was avoided, and IV fluids were used only sparingly for lowish BP, now stable.
