[**2115-6-4**]: Successful upsizing from a 10-French right percutaneous  transhepatic biliary drainage tube to a 12-French drain.
[**2115-6-6**] Cholangiogram: Unremarkable tube cholangiogram, with free flow of contrast into the jejunum.
2) Interval increase in ascites.
7) Stable anterior abdominal wall hernia containing loops of small bowel, without evidence of obstruction.
[**2116-6-13**] Chest Xray: PICC with its tip in the right atrium.
MICROBIOLOGY:  [**2115-6-4**] Bile: VRE+, Gram negative rods, rare yeast; [**6-4**] blood: non-fermenter (sensitive to Meropenum), [**6-8**] blood: negative  PATHOLOGY:  HEparin dependent antibodies: Negative  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 78 year old gentleman with a history of cholangiocarcinoma complicated by a common bile duct obstruction who presented on [**6-4**] with fevers and reported blood output from his right biliary catheter and bilious leaking around the drains.
He had a prolonged hospital course as detailed:  With regards to his underlying biliary disease the patient underwent cholangiogram with successful upsizing from a 10-French right percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage tube to a 12-French drain on hospital day 2.
It was thought that he had a hemothorax from injury to an intercostal blood vessel during the procedure and he received 2 prompt units of blood with stable subsequent hematocrit levels on serial checks.
He had a slight rise in LFTs and total bilirubin after drain internalization but these trended downwards towards his baseline levels by day of discharge.
From a neurologic standpoint the patient's mental status had improved after commencement of antibiotics and blood transfusion upon admission as well as IV fluids to correct pre-renal acute renal failure.
He did require significant pain medications during his hospitalization.
From a cardiovascular standpoint he remained in normal sinus rhythm and stable on his home amiodarone regimen with intermittant episodes of atrial fibrillation.
He continued to have mild congestive heart failure throughout his hospital course requiring intermittant diuresis and he was discharged on home oxygen therapy, which he had been taking in the past, as well as a standing regimen of [**Hospital1 **] Lasix.
He also had a low platelet count and hematocrit and required several transfusions of blood and platelets after hemothorax that occured during his PTC internalization on hospital day 7.
Prior to discharge he was started on a standing regimen of qeekly Epogen and daily Iron tablets for his anemia.
From an immunology standpoint he was started on empiric levofloxacin and linezolid while pan-cultures were pending; coverage was eventually taylored to include approximately 2 weeks Linezolid and Meropenum when admission culture data revealed meropenum-sensitive non-fermenting gram negative bacteria and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus from his blood and bile.
Repeat pan-cultures several days after antibiotics started were negative and he remained afebrile for the remaining duration of his hospital course.
His antibiotics regimen was completed prior to discharge, though he was discharged on levofloxacin for prophylaxis.
From a GI standpoint nutrition services were consulted for starting the patient on nutritional supplements and [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes was consulted with recommendation for re-starting the patient on home insulin therapy, which he had been taking in the past.
He received several days of hypertonic saline IV fluids with improvement in his hyponatremia and bolused IV fluids with resolution in his acute renal failure.
From a social services standpoint the patient was consulted by social work and case management and was set-up with a visiting nurse for home consultation.
He also worked with physical therapy daily and was seen to be able to ambulate on his own during the last week of his hospitalization.
