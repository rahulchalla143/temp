He received cefepime 2gm IV, vancomycin 1 gm IV, and Tylenol.
His PICC line was removed and sent for culture.
Blood cultures from admission grew [**4-2**] pansensitive staph aureus as well as [**2-2**] hafnia alvei which was sensitive to ceftriaxone, thus he was started on nafcillin and ceftriaxone.
Additionally, while in the ICU, he was found to have a DVT right basilic vein extending to axillary vein; for this he was started on heparin gtt with plan to transition to coumadin.
Prior to his admission, he was being treated for C. diff with PO vanco.

Stool: negative for Cdiff x 3, negative for O&P, stool culture negative  Brief Hospital Course: 68 year old man with diffuse B cell lymphoma status post two cycles of R-CHOP who presented with fever and hypotension in the setting of infected PICC line.
His PICC line was removed; blood cultures and PICC catheter tip grew MSSA and Hafnia Alvei.
He was given Nafcillin and Ceftriaxone.
He was placed on a heparin drip.
ID was consulted, and felt he should be treated for endocarditis.
The Ceftriaxone should be given for a 2-week course (Hafnia Alvei is not a common cause of endocarditis), and Nafcillin should be given for 6 weeks (as MSSA commonly causes endocarditis).
He was on a heparin drip for 1 week.
Heparin was d/c'd and no further anticoaggulation started for the following reasons: The DVT was associated with a line that was removed, and the patient has a h/o subdural & subarachnoid hemorrhage 3 months ago.
4) Diffuse large B cell lymphoma:  Received two cycles of R-CHOP previously.
Chemotherapy started in [**2138-3-30**].
He was on allopurinol for tumor lysis and neupogen for cell count enhancement.
Due to the infection and possible endocarditis, his CHOP chemotherapy will be held, but he was given 1 dose of Rituximab while inpatient.
The patient was continued on levothyroxine dose of 25mcg daily.
He received fluid resuscitation in the ICU initially.
8) Prophylaxis:  Was given heparin gtt for DVT as above, then ambulating.
Also given PPI and bowel regimen.
