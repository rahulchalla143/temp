[**1-7**] CARDIAC CATH: PLACEMENT OF PERICARDIAL DRAIN 1.
Pericardiocentesis was performed with removal of 350 ml of bloody fluid.
Following the drainage of 350 ml of sanguinous fluid, Pericardial pressure became neagtive with respiration.
Procedure complicated by placement of pericardial drainage catheter into the right atrium.
[**1-10**] CXR: The right-sided PICC line has been readjusted, and the distal tip is now in the right subclavian/axillary vein junction.
There is again noted deformity of the right chest wall with complete lung opacification.
The catheter seen projecting over the left base has been removed, likely related to the patient's pericardiocentesis.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 year old woman with non-small cell lung CA who presents with complaints of hemoptysis, ongoing cough, transferred from OSH with diagnosis of pericardial tamponade.
Patient underwent pericardial drain placement complicated by cannulization of the right ventricle.
The right ventricle drain was removed and an angioseal was placed.
During procedure patient went into SVT/Atrial fibrillation and was placed on an amiodarone drip.
Given subsequent hemodynamic compromise with atrial fibrillation in MICU, patient was maintained on amiodarone drip for 24 hours and converted to oral amiodarone.
The patient's pericardial drain was pulled on post op day 2.
Metoprolol was added to amiodarone for improved rate control.
The patient tolerated the addition of metoprolol for several days prior to discharge.
HEMOPTYSIS Patient's submassive hemoptysis was treated with IR embolization of right bronchial artery for palliation of symptoms.
Patient was followed by interventional pulmonary.
At the recommendation of the IP team and in accordance with the patient and her family's wishes, the patient underwent repeat palliative bronchial artery embolization on [**2190-1-11**].
Patient was maintained on her home prednisone dose.
Patient was also given levofloxacin for empiric treatment of pneumonia given patient has new oxygen requirement and lung opacification with known bronchus compression.
The patient will complete a 10 day course of levofloxacin and was set up with home oxygen for continuous supplementation by nasal cannula.
She will have home hospice services who will help with obtaining a nebulizer machine for ipratropium nebs and a home hospital bed.
POSITIVE BLOOD CULTURES: Patient grew 3 different colonies of coag neg staph and a clostridium species on initial blood cultures.
She was started on Vancomycin.
The patient had a midline placed which was subsequently removed.
She was discharged on levofloxacin monotherapy for treatment of likely pneumonia as above.
