Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2150-12-11**]: Neurosurgery of the spine with T5, T6 and T7 bilateral laminectomy, Anterior decompression with removal of disk material and soft tissue, Posterior instrumented fusion T4, T5, T6, T7 and T8 using pedicle screws, rods and cross-link (EBI spine array), with Autologous graft and Allograft.
History of Present Illness: This is a 66 year old male with PMH significant for squamous cell esophageal cancer diagnosed in [**2149**], s/p 3 cycles of cisplatin and 5FU and XRT, history of radiation pneumonitis, history of SVT s/p ablation, who is transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital due to concern for cord compression and urgent neurosurgical evaluation.
CT scan was performed at 7:30PM on [**2150-12-9**] demonstrating severe compression of the T6 vertebral body, resulting in a kyphotic angulation of the spine, with significant retropulsion of bone fragments into the spinal canal at this level, which reduces the diameter of the spinal canal by approximately 50%.
Broke with 5mg IV lopressor X 1.
Past Medical History: - squamous cell esophageal cancer: diagnosed in [**2149**] by EGD with presence of bulky mediastinal adenopathy involving the upper mediastinum; s/p 3 cycles of cisplatin and 5FU and XRT then two more cycles of chemo - history of radiation pneumonitis - intermittent dysphagia - history of supraventricular tachycardia s/p ablation - compression of spinal cord level T6 secondary to fracture of his T6 vertebral body - history of radiation pneumonitis treated with solumedrol - subacute T6 compression fracture - s/p right nephrectomy - cholelithiasis  Social History: Married, lives with wife and son.
Pathologic compression fracture likely, with involvement by tumor.
Thickening of esophagus and para-esophageal lymphadenopathy concordant with history of esophageal cancer.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 year old man with metastatic squamous cell esophageal cancer diagnosed in [**2149**] s/p 3 cycles of cisplatin and 5FU and XRT, history of radiation pneumonitis, history of SVT s/p ablation admitted for cord compression and urgent neurosurgical evaluation with bilateral pleural effusions; his hospital course was complicated by MICU admission for bilateral widespread pulmonary emboli, pressor requirement, and intubation.
He was continued on Dexamethasone and evaluated by both radiation oncology and neurosurgical services.
He was taken to the operating room on [**2150-12-11**] and underwent T5, T6 and T7 bilateral laminectomy, anterior decompression with removal of disk material and soft tissue, posterior instrumented fusion T4, T5, T6, T7 and T8 using pedicle screws, rods and cross-link (EBI spine array), autologous graft, and allograft.
He was treated initially with a Heparin gtt and transitioned to likely lifelong anticoagulation with Lovenox.
He received an IVC filter [**2150-12-17**] for persistent extensive occlusive deep venous thrombosis of the left lower extremity involving the common femoral vein throughout the calf veins documented on [**2150-12-16**] bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds.
Of note, the pt had made an informed decision regarding anticoagulation in the face of having had recent nuerosurgery (had been discussed with NSurg attending as well) and also from this unclear lesion noted in his brain.
# Through his course in the MICU, the pt required pressors and intubation.
His pressors were also weaned successfully.
He briefly received steroids for a random am cortisol of 13 but this was stopped by time of discharge from MICU without significant consequence.
Regarding volume status: through his course in MICU was being diuresed with 10-20 mg IV Lasix boluses at a time.
The pt was satting 97-100% on 2-4L NC by discharge from MICU and on d/c from the hospital as well.
# Code status and disposition: The patient and his wife confirmed on [**2150-12-25**] that the patient is DNR/DNI.After lengthy discussions with the patient and his wife, they do not want the patient to be placed in rehabilitation but prefer to go home with the support of hospice care.
After further discussion, they understood that rehabilitation would not restore the patient's ability to walk.
Rather, the goal of rehabilitation would be to maximize the patient's ability to safely carry out activities of daily living with his permanent paraplegia, including transfer from bed to commode and wheelchair but that he would likely not be able to walk again.
The patient had a feeding tube during concurrent chemo/xrt for his esophageal cancer and adamantly does not want another feeding tube.
# Ground glass opacities seen on CTA: Could not rule out infectious process/aspiration PNA, so pt was started on Vanc/Cefepime, was eventually switched to Merrem, and by time of call out from MICU had completed an approximately 7 day course of antibiotics.
# Cardiac rhythm: While on the floor, pt noted to have narrow complex SVT's to the 200's which were intermittently treated with beta blockade.
This was also seen in the MICU, in addition to some runs of atrial fibrillation; this was also treated with intermittent beta blockade but pt was not kept on this by time of discharge from MICU.
# Metastatic esophageal cancer: The patient has been treated with 3 cycles of cisplatin and 5FU and XRT for esophageal cancer diagnosed in [**2149**] that is now metastatic to spine.
Given pt's poor performance status and multiple co-morbidities pt not a candidate for palliative chemotherapy treatment and after discussions with wife and pt they decided to pursue hospice care.
He was treated with levofloxicin and continued on this after his admission to [**Hospital1 18**].
# Anxiety and depression: The patient was continued on lorazepam and citalopram.

You had surgery for your cord compression and steroids that improved your pain, but these only minimally improved the strength in your legs.
Because of these problems, you needed to be transferred to the intensive care unit and put on a ventilator (breathing machine) for several days.
The speech and swallowing service did testing that shows you aspirate thin liquids into your lungs and are at risk to aspirate all liquids and foods into your lungs.
Followup Instructions: F/U with Neurosurgery, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], on [**2150-1-26**]: CT scan of thoracic spine at 8:30 am, [**Hospital Ward Name **] clinical building, [**Location (un) 9158**].
