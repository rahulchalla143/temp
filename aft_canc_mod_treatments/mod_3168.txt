Admission Date:  [**2195-12-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2196-1-8**]   Service:  Thoracic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83 year old female who was first noted to have a right upper lung mass on chest x-ray in [**2194-12-17**] as she was preoped for a coronary artery bypass graft.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2195-1-17**], abdominal aortic aneurysm 5 cm, hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, carotid bruit.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery bypass graft.
MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 Digoxin .125 Paroxetine 40 q.d.
Alprazolam .25 t.i.d.
Lipitor 20 q.d.
It was therefore decided to proceed with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and a wedge resection of this right upper lobe mass.
She underwent a right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and wedge resection of her right upper lobe mass and lower lobe nodule.
She tolerated the procedure with no difficulty, was extubated at the end of the case and was transferred to the postoperative recovery area and then to the floor.
A similar episode occurred the next day requiring short-term intubation and at that point it became clear that the blood pressures were clearly associated with the occurrence of the respiratory failure and at this point chest x-rays also showed more clearly that she had developed congestive heart failure.
It was therefore thought that she was developing pulmonary edema secondary to hypertension and that she required tight blood pressure control.
This was initially done with a drip of Nitroglycerin and then she was transitioned to Captopril p.o.
These were discontinued during her hospitalization and she developed a slight confusion.
She did not require any further pain medications and was comfortable with Tylenol only and prior to discharge her mental status was at baseline.
Because of the fact that she developed congestive heart failure she was diuresed here aggressively, initially with a Lasix drip and Lasix intravenously and Lasix p.o.
Since she was not at home on diuretics and it seemed that prior to discharge that her volume status is at baseline, Lasix was discontinued on transfer to rehabilitation but this should be again re-evaluated clinically by primary care physician and the cardiologist on follow up.
She is on Protonix for gastrointestinal prophylaxis.
She had been taking Zantac at home.
Heme - She remains stable and does not require blood products.
There was no further evidence that this was the case, we completed a course of one week's treatment around her acute events of respiratory failure, intubation, reintubation and extubation.
She is not a very active woman at baseline and will require further physical therapy and it was felt that she will benefit from a short stay in the rehabilitation facility.
Continue medications as outlined in the discharge sheet.
