- She was initially put on supplemental oxygen and started on a continuous IV heparin infusion for anticoagulation.
Upon transfer out of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], her heparin was transitioned to enoxaparin 1mg/kg [**Hospital1 **] for long-term anticoagulation.
Her supplemental oxygen was very slowly weaned off.
Upon discharge, she wsa completely off of supplemental oxygen and able to ambulate with a walker.
- Her CCB and beta blocker were initially held while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to hypotension.
Upon transfer out, her BP was stable and she was resumed on her home dose of beta blocker for rate control of her chronic sinus tachycardia.
# CAD: hx of STEMI s/p PCI with stents.
- She was continued on her beta blocker as above.
She was continued on aspirin and her statin.
Her clopidogrel was held as above since she was 11 months out from stenting and since her new enoxaparin therapy would be further increasing her risk of bleeding.
# DM2 - Her Lantus dose was increased to 40u QAM (from a home dose of 20u) upon admission to the ICU.
- Due to her chronic prednisone therapy, she was put on stress-dose steroids at the outside hospital.
This was switched to prednisone upon admission to the floor and gradually tapered back to her home regimen of 5mg daily.
She was continued on chronic CellCept and Entocort per her home regimen.
Continued on atovaquone, acyclovir, and fluconazole.
- A R femoral line placed at the outside hospital was d/c'ed while in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] .
