He was started on ceftazidime 2 gm IV q8h, and IV colistin at 150 mg IV q 12 hours, and continued on inhaled colistin 75 mg (given hx of recurrent pseudomonas PNAs).
The pulmonologist who saw him felt he wasn't ventilating enought and increased his PS from 14 to 18 cm H2O to increase TV to 480 cc.
Patient was given 1 gm IV vancomycin, 4.5 gm IV zosyn, and 4 mg morphine IV.
On admission he denied shortness of breath, pain, or other symptoms.
Per report from his rehab, his feeding tube is clogged.
- Treated with six cycles of CHOP/Rituxan with good response, but showed evidence for relapse in [**12/2154**] and was treated with MINE chemotherapy for two cycles.
- [**2156-7-29**]: Nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant with a [**5-30**] HLA-matched unrelated donor with Campath conditioning  - Six-month follow-up CT noted for disease progression.

- undergone phlebotomy due to iron overload with corresponding drop in his ferritin.
He has continued with transient rises in his transaminases and bilirubin and has remained on varying doses of CellCept and prednisone which has been slowly tapered over the time.
After extensive workup, this was felt related to an  infection and required several admissions with completion of antibiotics in 03/[**2158**].

- [**2160-11-13**] completed a 4 week course of Rituxan to treat his GVHD.

As per his ID attending, at that time the patient was continued on inhaled colistin, IV colistin and IV fluconazole.
On admission, these were continued and the patient's coverage was broadened by replacing IV ceftazadine with IV doripenem.
His admission sputum culture grew out multidrug resistant pseudomonas, sensitive to amikacin and intermediate for ceftazadine.
In response to these sensitivities, the patient was restarted on ceftazadine (with extended infusion times in order to maximize time dependent bacterial killing) and his doripenem was stopped.
At this point, the patient had increasing secretions in setting of a WCC spike, bandemia and fever.
His fungal coverage was eventually changed to micafungin in order to more broadly cover against potential fungal infections.
Cetazadine was stopped at this time.
He can moderately tolerate assist control, and prefers it, despite recommendations that he remain on pressure support.
He has requested a swallow study and P-M valve, but is not a candidate for it unless he agrees to have his settings changed over to pressure support.
# Clogged feeding tube/Nutrition: The dobhoff tube was replaced by IR and he was continued on tube feeds in addition to TPN (given his inability to tolerate heavy feeding via dobhoff).
His tube feeds are to be administered at half strenght.
Whenever available liquid suspensions of medications should be given per NGT rather than crushing the tablets.
# s/p alloSCT complicated by GVHD:  He was transitioned to PO Predinisone.
He was maintained on his prophylaxis regiment of Acyclovir and bactrim.
He was discharged with instructions to have his LFTs followed q3days, and restarting cellcept would be considered at follow-up oncology appointment.
He was asymptomatic and did not require any transfusions.
