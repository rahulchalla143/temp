Admission Date:  [**2120-11-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2121-1-9**]   Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83 year-old female with a history of rectal cancer who was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2120-11-9**] for a low anterior resection of her rectal cancer with ileostomy and omental flap placement over the stump.
From a respiratory standpoint, the patient was extubated on the following day, but required reintubation after three days secondary to increasing secretions and need for constant pulmonary toilet.
Per the Surgery Service the collection was noted to be draining into the rectal stump and they recommended no further surgical management.
From an infectious disease standpoint four out of four blood culture bottles from [**12-5**] and [**12-6**] grew coag negative staphylococcus, which has been treated with Vancomycin.
Blood cultures from [**12-18**] subsequently grew [**Female First Name (un) **] [**Female First Name (un) 29361**], and the patient completed a fourteen day course of Fluconazole on [**1-4**].
There was also concern about coronary artery disease.
She has been treated with Amiodarone and Lopressor with good effects.
From a nutrition standpoint the patient was initially on total parenteral nutrition, but this was discontinued after the [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**] fungemia.
The patient has since been on tube feeds via nasogastric tube and is at her goal.
She has been tried on Celexa and Ritalin without benefit.
Rectal carcinoma status post radiation therapy and chemosensitization and low anterior resection on [**2120-11-15**].
Coronary artery disease with a 30% left anterior descending coronary artery, 50% right coronary artery.
ALLERGIES:  Penicillin, Erythromycin and intravenous contrast (but she can tolerate the contrast).
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Lopressor 50 mg po b.i.d., Wellbutrin 100 mg po t.i.d., Lasix 80 mg po b.i.d., Prevacid 30 mg po q.d., Amiodarone 400 mg po q.d., Atrovent, Colace 100 mg po b.i.d., Reglan 10 mg po q.i.d., heparin subQ, Tylenol prn.
She was sating 100% of 4 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.
Her colostomy site was clean and intact.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the General Medicine Service on [**1-6**] for further management.
Pulmonary:  The patient had daily chest physical therapy and an aggressive pulmonary toilet.
We decided to treat the patient with a course of Ciprofloxacin for the Pseudomonas in her sputum.
We discussed her treatment with the infectious disease fellow who did not think that she needed to be double covered for the pan sensitive Pseudomonas in her sputum.
Her oxygen saturations improved dramatically to the point that she required 3 to 4 liters by nasal cannula to maintain appropriate oxygen saturation.
She was followed by the Surgery Service during her stay and they did not believe that she needed any further surgical management.
She was continued on the Amiodarone and Lopressor.
She responded quite well with low dose intravenous Lopressor converting to sinus rhythm almost instantaneous.
Despite this we opted to continue the Amiodarone and Lopresor.
