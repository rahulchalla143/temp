The patient was noted to have increased sputum secretion with frequent plugging.
Initially treated with one dose of vancomycin and then switched to cefazolin.
The patient was transferred and Interventional Pulmonary at [**Hospital1 1444**] placed stents in the right mainstem bronchus and the patient was extubated.

This dramatically improved as the patient came out of the unit and was rehydrated for his hypernatremia.
