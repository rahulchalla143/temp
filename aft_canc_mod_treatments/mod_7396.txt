Patient rolled and found to have a stage IV decubitus ulcer on coccyx and buttocks, heels.
Right IJ inserted and Sepsis protocol was initiated.
Patient given 5L NS and started on Norepinephrine drip.
Patient started on Vancomyxin and Zosyn.
Tob: 1pack every few days for 10 years EtOH: Denies Illicit drugs: Denies - but tested positive for cocaine in urine in ED in the past.
Normal S1 and S2 Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilatearally Skin: Stage IV decubitus ulcer along sacrum / coccyx with spontaneous drainage and purulence.
[**9-5**] CT P: CT-guided needle placement in the right hip yielded no fluid; the hypodense area seen on the CT scan therefore likely represents organizing granulation tissue or phlegmon rather than a loculated fluid collection.
Brief Hospital Course: 43 year old woman with transverse myelitis and paraplegia c/b severe pressure ulcers and several prior wound infections who presented on [**8-11**] with sepsis successfully treated with early goal-directed therapy thought [**2-19**] decubiti and osteomyelitis also with E.coli and subsequent E.cloacae urinary tract infection stable on current regimen of vancomycin and meropenem.
She was initially treated with vancomycin, cipro, and flagyl.
As she continued to spike through this regimen, she was changed to vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.
Vancomycin was stopped and the patient was maintained on sole therapy with zosyn.
All antibiotics were stopped for approximately 2 days after an area of possible fluid collection was located in the patient's right hip.
Unfortunately, her course in IR was complicated when the IR needle broke off in her hip and had to be retrieved with a small incision by surgery.
Patient was started on meropenem and vancomycin which, as per ID, was sufficient for empiric treatment for osteomyelitis.
The patient will take antibiotics for 6 total weeks, until end of [**Month (only) 359**], for empiric treatment at [**Hospital1 **].
She defervesced with ceftazadime and, since this antibiotic was necessary for her osteomyelitis treatment, she was continued on this antibiotic for her UTI as well as her osteo.
Patient subsequently developed a UTI with fevers with E.cloacae sensitive to meropenem growing within urine on urine culture.
Patient was summarily begun on meropenem and, in addition, was started on vancomycin for possible bacteremia that was, most likely, a contaminant, but was also used for empiric treatment of her osteomyelitis.
Patient now on meropenem and vancomycin empirically for osteomyelitis treatment at [**Hospital1 **].
Urology was consulted and the patient was started on ditropan TID with some benefit per her.
Urology also discussed possible surgical procedures with the patient (including a procedure to tighten the urethra) but felt there was nothing additional to do while in-patient given current other medical problems.
Psychiatry diagnosed her with shizophrenia vs. schizoaffective disorder, and started her on Risperdal 2mg [**Hospital1 **] with 2mg [**Hospital1 **] PRN.
She was maintained on risperidone.
