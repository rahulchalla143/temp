Endotracheal tube tip is slightly low lying, approximately 2.6 cm from the carina.
Nasogastric tube in standard position.
Increased intraventricular and midbrain hemorrhage when compared to the most recent examination.
Interval insertion of a right frontal ventriculostomy catheter tip terminating near the third ventricle with slight interval decrease in size of the frontal horns, though slight expansion in size of the temporal and occipital horns.
[**2143-2-3**] PERIPHERAL BLOOD FLOW CYTOMETRY: INTERPRETATION: Ommunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by acute promyelocytic leukemia.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 33 yo female s/p fall presenting with HA, left sided weakness, seizure activity now with 3 cm IPH with likely herniation s/p EVD placement by NSGY with elevated ICP (45 initially), also found to have pancytopenia and DIC labs consistent with likely early DIC  # IPH/Elevated ICP: Patient was initially transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] once noted to have 3 cm IPH on OSH head CT.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (neurosurgery) evaluated patient in the ED, and and EVD was placed with marked elevated pressures (45 initially).
She had a central line placed, and arterial line placed, and was closely monitored for ICP elevation as well as sodium and osmolarity.
She was given further products to maintain her plts greater than 50K.
She had Q1H neurochecks, and mannitol was given to maintain Na and osmolarity.
She was also started on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis, and given cefazolin for EVD/skin prophylaxis.
After meetings with both Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (hematology attending), the ICU team, and the patient's family, it was determined that no further intervention can be performed which would reverse the patient's condition.
The patient was started on all trans retinoic acid shortly after arrival to the MICU .
Social work was also involved with this patient's care and her family.
