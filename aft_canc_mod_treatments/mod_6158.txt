Of note, E. faecalis during prior admission was treated with ampicillin.
Antibiotics were completed [**2185-4-30**], however his PICC was retained.

Vancomycin was considered but not given due to no IV access.

Fusiform dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta to 2.6 cm.
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images generated on an independent workstation were valuable in assessment for source of infection or bleeding.
There is atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta and coronary arteries.
He was diuresed with IV Lasix and showed improvement, O2 requirement decreased from 6LNC to 4LNC.
Rate control was obtained with Digoxin (pt was loaded), Diltiazem, and Metoprolol.
The patient was subtherapeutic on his coumadin so a heparin bridge was briefly initiated until he became therapeutic.
As he was not on oxygen prior to [**Month (only) 958**], it was thought that he was in acute heart failure with poor baseline reserve from his COPD, so he was aggressively diuresed with lasix.
He was discharged on lasix 40 mg PO daily, spironolactone 12.5 mg daily and home O2.
He had a positive blood culture at the rehab center and had his PICC line removed (per report the tip was cultured and showed no growth).
The source of the patient's recurrent enterococcus bacteremia was further investigated, and GI was consulted to determine if he was seeding his blood from a source in the gut.
The patient will need to continue ampicillin for a total of four week course to end on [**2185-6-13**]  He will follow up with ID on [**2185-6-9**].
His PICC line was not centrally located at discharge but after discussion with pharmacy and nursing it was concluded it could be still be used as a midline for Ampicillin administration.
In the ICU he was loaded with Digoxin and started on diltiazem in addition to his metoprolol.
He was rate controlled on this regimen with rates in the 80s-90s.
Eventually the diltiazem was discontinued and he remained well controlled.
Coumadin was continued and he was found to have a subtheraputic INR during which time he was bridged with heparin.
His INR later became therapeutic and heparin was stopped.
Hypertension: The patient was started on Dogoxin, and diltiazem in addition to his home dose metoprolol as above for rate control.
He was also started on lasix for his CHF.
His diltiazem was discontinued and he was aggressively diuresed as his blood pressure could tolerate.
He was not started on an ACE inhibitor depite his low ejection fraction because he was heavily diuresed with lasix and his SBP remained 90's-110's after he was re-started on his PO lasix dose.
He should continue to take 40 mg PO of lasix daily.
He should discuss with his PCP the need to start an ACE inhibitor due to his low ejection fraction.
It was thought that in the setting of sepsis and IV fluid administration as well as a fib with RVR, the patient had decompensation of his CHF.
He diuresed well to Lasix 20mg IV, and was negative 1 to 2 liters a day during the course of his admission.
His respiratory status improved, however he still required supplemental oxygen at discharge.
He will need to continue his lasix and metoprolol.
He was started on spironolactone 12.5 mg daily for mortality benefit and on simvastatin 20 mg daily.
As above, he should eventually start an ACE inhibitor if his blood pressure can tolerate it.
# Urinary retention:  The patient had a foley placed in the ICU when he was being resuscitated.
After the foley was removed he failed his voiding trial.
He was started on finasteride and tamsulosin and his urinary retention improved.

You were started on antibiotics for this infection.
You will need to continue to take antibiotics by IV until [**2185-6-13**].
You were given medicines to take fluid off and your breathing was better - although not back to your baseline from [**Month (only) 958**].
It was thought that your CHF and COPD were contributing to your chronic shortness of breath.
You will need to continue to take lasix to prevent fluid from building up in your lungs and causing you to be short of breath.
