Four clips were applied to this area after which hemostasis was confirmed by visualization.
Pt was first placed on PPI gtt, intubated for airway protection and underwent EGD.
She received a total of 8 units of pRBC, and 3 units of frozen plasma for hemodynamic stability.
# Hypoxemia: Pt was intubated initially for airway protection.
She continued to require mechanical ventilation for 5 days, most likely secondary to fluid overload from transfusion.
Contributing factors leading to her hypoxemia include OSA, reactive airway disease and possible Vent Assoc Pneumonia for which she received Vancomycin for 8 days total.
She was initially treated with Vancomycin, Tobramycin and Aztreotam.
tobramycin and aztreotam were discontinued afterwards.
She continued on Vancomycin for total of 8 days.
We experdiated the placement of HD-tunnel line in the setting of fluid overload.
We held her metoprolol, hydralazine and amlodipine in the setting of GIB.
Her blood pressure medication were slowly resumed after achieving hemodynamic stability.
Only metoprolol was added back on.
# Atrial fibrillation: Pt had documented history of atrial fibrillation, and on coumadin at home.
We continued to hold coumadin until readdressing this as an outpatient.
When metoprolol 25mg PO BID was restarted, she returned to [**Location 213**] sinus rhythm.
# DM2: was hypoglycemic at times, and thus initially held her home 75/25 standing insulin but then retarted this of roughly half of her home dose.
Transitions of care: - GI appointment to address polyps and future C-scope as well as to address decision about anticoagualation with pradaxa vs. asa vs. coumadin.
- As she was hypoglycemic at times during the admission, we initially held her home 75/25 standing insulin but then retarted this of roughly half of her home dose.
- Several days before discharge, she had difficulty retaining urine and thus a foley was left in place for a voiding trial to take place once she arrives at rehab.

VOIDING TRIAL Patient was discharged with foley catheter because of urinary retention.
A bleeding artery was clipped in the colon and you were treated for a pneumonia.
You were also started on diaylsis.
REGARDING YOUR MEDICATIONS... START: paricalcitol, insulin sliding scale STOP: hydralazine, furosemide, amlodipine, warfarin, ferrous sulfate, CHANGE: insulin lispro 70/30 = DECREASED from 70 units with breakfast, 62 units with dinner.
Otherwise, it is very important that you take all of your usual home medications as directed in your discharge paperwork.
Your anticoagulation will be held unto you see your Gastrointestinal doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4939**] and a decision will be made with your primary care doctor regarding how to proceed with anticoagulation given your atrial fibrillation.
