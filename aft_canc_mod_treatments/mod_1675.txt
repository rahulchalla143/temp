MEDICATIONS:  Medications on admission: Lantus 21 units at bedtime; Humalog 10 units with breakfast, 9 units lunch, and 20 to 25 units at dinner.
Levoxyl 127 mcg q a.m. Aspirin 81 mg daily.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2173-4-5**] the patient underwent a left composite resection of his left buccal fossa, as well as a left modified radical neck dissection and a left radial forearm free flap and partial mandibulectomy for his left buccal carcinoma resection procedure.
By systems neurologically his pain was initially controlled with an IV pain regimen, which once he began tolerating NG tube feeds and later po, was switched to po pain control, Roxicet elixir.
He was maintained on a perioperative beta blocker regimen.
He was gradually weaned off ventilation post procedure and was maintained on room air by postoperative day 3.
GI: Postoperatively the patient had an NG tube for possible feeding.
This NG tube began to be used on postoperative day 2.
The patient also began to tolerate a regular oral diet on postoperative day 5 and took in enough that his tube feeds were shut off by postoperative day 6.
His NG tube was then removed on postoperative day 7 prior to discharge.
The patient tolerated a mechanical soft oral diet without any episodes of nausea or vomiting.
His Foley was removed after he was transferred out of the intensive care unit and he voided spontaneously without complication.
ID: The patient was maintained on a course of Clindamycin due to some mild diarrhea as he switched from his tube feeding to his oral regimen.
On postoperative day 6 the patient's Clindamycin was discontinued given the possibility of C. diff colitis and he was started on Flagyl, which he was then sent home with for 24 hour coverage after the drain was removed after discharge.
