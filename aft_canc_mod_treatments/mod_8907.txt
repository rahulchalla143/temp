He also had pain at rest which resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin.
He was discharged home with a goal to decrease his white count prior to coronary artery bypass grafting, however, the patient was home for 7 hours after discharge and was laying in bed when he started developing chest pain again which radiated to the left arm which did not resolve with sublingual nitroglycerin.

At this point the cardiac surgery team was consulted and it was determined that he would go for coronary artery bypass grafting the next day.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2101-8-25**], the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times three as follows:  saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1, saphenous vein graft to right posterior descending artery, performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**], assisted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as well as physician assistant, [**Name9 (PRE) **].
However, he did go into atrial fibrillation on postoperative day #2 and was started on Amiodarone.
At this point he was examined and noted to have erythema and induration at the site of an intravenous line which was located in his left forearm.
The intravenous line was removed and there was pus noted coming from the site of the entry of the intravenous line into the skin.
Given these findings, the patient underwent an incision and drainage of pus from this suppurative thrombophlebitis that had occurred at the site of his intravenous.
The patient tolerated his procedure well and by postoperative day #6 remained afebrile for 24 hours with resolution of the induration of the cellulitis of the left arm.
