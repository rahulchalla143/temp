2)  Successful lysis of the thrombosed fistula using a total of 10 mg of t-PA. 3)  Venoplasty of the outflow cephalic vein stenoses using an 8-mm balloon and of the severe right brachiocephalic stenosis using a 12-mm balloon, all with good angiographic success and restoration of forward flow.
There is airspace opacity along the tract of the prior chest tube which may represent contusion vs. consolidation.
[**2138-2-15**] CXR: Left-sided PICC line is in distal SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: 71 year old man type II diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease s/p CABG, congestive heart failure (nml EF), CML, end stage renal disease s/p failed renal transplant on hemodialysis, transferred from outside hospital with hemothorax to Transplant surgery SICU team.
Hemothorax:  The patient was initially transferred for VATS and thoracotomy by the thoracic surgery team.
He developed respiratory failure requiring intubation on [**2138-2-3**], and transfer to the MICU.
A chest tube was placed.
Gram stain and culture were negative; however, the patient was on antibiotics (levofloxacin) at the time of the tap for treatment of post-intubation tracheobronchitis.
The patient was extubated [**2138-2-5**], and supplemental O2 requirements weaned.
Hypoxia:  Postextubation the patient required supplemental O2.
He was treated with a 7 days course of levofloxacin 250mg Q48hrs for treatment of tracheobronchitis.
The initial decompensation requiring intubation was thought to be due to mucus plugging.
He was continued on aspirin, metoprolol, and a statin for secondary prophylaxis.
He was treated for a day with Zosyn and Vancomycin for concern of hospital acquired or aspiration pneumonia.
As no findings were seen on CXR or chest CT, this was attributed to tracheobronchitis and treated with a 7day course of levofloxacin.
Delirium:  the patient developed a delirium complicated by agitation requiring a 1:1 sitter, Zyprex and Haldol, soft restraints.
The delirium resolved with treatment of his multiple medical issues.
He was continued on Zyprexa qHS.
Nutrition:  During his delirium he had an NG tube placed, and he was sustained on tubefeeds.
He was started on a nectar-thickened diet.
He was discharged on a diabetic, renal, heart healthy, low sodium diet of thin liquids and regular solids.
Hypotension:  in the ICU the patient became hypotensive and required a small dose of levophed.
He was also treated with stress dose steroids.
He was made NPO, treated with gentle ivf's.
He completed his course of anticoagulation and has an IVC filter in place.
He was treated with DVT prophylaxis with heparin SC.
A temporarily groin line was placed for dialysis.
This was pulled and the A-v fistula was used 4 times for dialysis prior to discharge.
Cardiac:  He has known CAD s/p CABG and stent and CHF.
He was treated with aspirin, metoprolol and statin.
End stage renal disease:  He was continued on M,W,F hemodialysis.
Type II diabetes mellitus:  he was monitored with QID fingersticks and treated with a regular insulin sliding scale.
A standing regimen of insulin was not initiated as the patient's diet fluctuated with tubefeeds, then NPO, then slowly advancing diet.
He was continued on prednisone 5mg daily for his failed renal transplant.
He was evaluated by physical therapy and occupational therapy prior to discharge.
