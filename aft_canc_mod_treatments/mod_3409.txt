Labs on discharge: Na 140  Cl 104  BUN 16  Glc 99 K 3.7  CO2 30  Cr 0.5 Phos: 2.0  WBC 12.1 Hgb 8.6/Hct 26.1 Plts 711     Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 74 yo male with a history of COPD admitted with Strep milleri empyema, now s/p CT tube removal and full course abx, with intercurrent diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of likely biliary primary, course complicated by recurrent aspiration pna and blood loss anemia .
Discussed with GI briefly possible additional work-up for unexplained Hct drops; ERCP or push enteroscopy with side view scope could identify hematobilia if present, although this is unlikely as explanation of bleeding requiring transfusion since hematobilia would be more chronic; they could perform procedure diagnostically but there would not be endoscopic therapeutic options.
# Recurrent/aspiration pna: after completing full course (5 weeks) antibiotics for Strep milleri pneumonia with empyema drained with chest tubes, patient had increasing rhonchi, leukocytosis, low grade fevers.
Continue pulmonary toilet, supplemental O2 .
