Liver Bx: Liver, needle core biopsy:  1.Marked peri-centrivenular, mild portal and periportal inflammation consisting of lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils and macrophages with apoptotic hepatocytes and peri-centrivenular hepatocyte drop out (confirmed by reticulin stain).
2.Associated foci of central endothelialitis with peri-centrivenular hemorrhagic necrosis identified.
4.Trichrome stain highlights central vein damage; no definitive increase in fibrosis identified.
The differential includes an immune-mediated drug effect and autoimmune hepatitis; viral hepatitis is less likely.
Given the patient's history of monoclonal gammopathy and the presence of rare binucleate plasma cells, the case will be further reviewed by hematopathology and their findings issued separately in an addendum.
, EKG [**2171-3-4**]: Sinus tachycardia with increase in rate as compared with previoui tracing of [**2171-2-23**].
The Dobbhoff tube tip is in the stomach.
Dobbhoff feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not completely identified but positioned within the stomach proximally.
Feeding tube ends in the upper stomach.
Was treated with suppression ciprofloxacin, aggressive chest PT, mucolytics, nebulizers (many of which were refused).
Transitioned from albuterol to xopenex nebs b/c the former left the patient feeling too "jittery".
He was started on atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] (bactrim held given possible contribution to LFT elevations and pt did not tolerate daptomycin --> episode of flushing, tachycardia).
Pulm also suggested an acapella flutter device, [**Doctor First Name **] nebs 3x/wk (started [**3-2**]), and blood testing for CF.
His antibiotics were broadened and he stayed overnight in the MICU before returning to the floor.
A morphine drip to titrate to confort was started, as discussed and agreed by the patient, his wife, the pulmonary fellow, attending Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] resident.
Patient's antibiotics and every other med including IVIG and CSA were continued.
Despite increasing doses of morphine drip, patient continued to exhibit tachypnea and patient was made CMO that evening.
Patient received morphine bolus doses on top of drip and all other medications were held.
He was maintained on IV steroids briefly but then switched back to po prednisone and is currently on a long taper.
After extensive discussion involving GI and heme/onc (appreciate derm's continued input), commenced cyclosporine 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**3-7**] and then increased to 50 [**Hospital1 **] on [**3-10**] and 100 [**Hospital1 **] on [**3-14**].
The rest of his skin regimen includes clobetasol + plastic wrapping, mupirocin for his lower face and neck, and topical tacrolimus (mixed 1:1 with vaseline) for around his eyes.
Received linezolid [**Date range (1) 19593**] and also daptomycin but had a rxn during infusion.
Started on cefepime (narrowed to nafcillin on [**2-28**]), and was afebrile until [**3-4**].
ID narrowed to nafcillin [**2-28**].
Pt had poor quality TTE that did not reveal vegetations but a TEE was deferred given aspiration risk and pt preference.
Pt is adamant in refusal of G-tube and TPN.
He required dexamethasone and gelclair along with viscous lidocaine for oral care.
At time of his most recent discharge he was set up to have LFTs followed up after discontinuation of antibiotics to ensure resolution of transaminitis.
He was continued on high dose prednisone throughout.
He was continued on prednisone (40-60 mg daily) and started on azathioprine with continued worsening of his transaminitis.
Ultimately azathioprine was discontinued after 10 days ([**Date range (1) **]).
Bactrim was also held given its potential contribution.
His LFTs continued to decline, and he was briefly transitioned to IV methylprednisolone before being switched back to prednisone.
Following a switch in the patient's continuous tube feeds (namely a different formula with a reduced free water content), the hyponatremia resolved.
WBC declined < 3K but climbed after conclusion of IVIG tx 5-6K (~[**2-23**] - [**2-26**]).
Social work following ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 636**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12471**]); has been a source of incredible support for pt and wife.
