Prior to transfer, he was hypotensive into the 70s and was given a total of 2L NS and 4 units of pRBC.
S/p XRT and bolus cisplatin from [**Date range (2) 76684**], Cyberknife therapy [**Date range (1) 76685**], and 3 cycles of adjuvant cisplatin/5-FU - last on [**2184-3-19**].

Imaging: ======== CT neck: Interval intubation and NG tube placement with mottled air and fluid density compatible with hemorrhage filling the nares and nasopharynx.
Endotracheal tube approximately 5 cm from the level of the carina.
An NG tube tip is not seen but is at least as far as the stomach.
Erosion of the right medial clivus and the medial margin of the right petrous carotid canal, as seen previously.
Extensive paranasal sinus disease, as described above  Brief Hospital Course: 55-year-old man with nasopharyngeal carcinoma s/p chemoradiation presented with epistaxis and admitted to the MICU and found to have right cartid perforation now s/p carotid artery stent placement by interventinoal radiology.
Patient was intubated for airway protection in setting of profuse bleeding.
Patient underwent IR-guided placement of a coated stent into right internal carotid artery.
Started on plavix post-procedure and will need to continue plavix x 1 month.
Patient had a bronchoscopy with removal of blood (no clots of active bleeding seen), and subsequently successfully extubated on [**4-20**].
Given encacement of carotid, chemotherapy will be deferred as it may increase risk of re-bleed.
He was treated with 8 days of unasyn and remained afebrile for the remainder of hospital course.
Speech and swallow was consulted who initially recommended nectar thick liquids and no solids.
Dysphagia is likely related to a combination of intubation and instrumentation in a patient with a history of XRT therapy.
He was treated conservatively with warm compresses.
He required pressors initially and subsequently weaned off.
Received a total of 8 units of pRBCs, 3L IVF and platelet transfusion in setting of bleed.
WBC increased to 12 from admission likely due to aspiration of blood and possible pneumonia, started on unasyn as above for coverage of aspiration pneumonia.
