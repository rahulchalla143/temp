Wound swab ([**2182-5-7**]): moderate MRSA Wound swab ([**2182-5-10**]): heavy MRSA Wound swab ([**2182-5-12**]): sparse MRSA Wound swab ([**2182-5-14**]): sparse MRSA Wound swab ([**2182-5-17**]): rare MRSA, rare E. coli (pan-sensitive) .
There, he was put on empiric vancomycin/pip-tazo and taken to the OR for I&D by orthopedics; a wound vac was placed intra-operatively.
Given this, his vanco was increased to 1000 mg IV q8h and linezolid was later added due to his continued fevers/bacteremia.
On the floor, his fevers persisted in spite of dual therapy with vancomycin and linezolid.
Due to low vancomycin levels, his dose was eventually increased up to 1500 mg IV q8h.
He went for an additional washout of his thigh on [**2182-5-14**], this time with washout of the left hip joint as well (intra-operatively found to have frank pus in the joint capsule).
Also of note, he became somewhat leukopenic, and there was concern that his leukopenia and fevers may have both been due to vancomycin (i.e.
drug fevers) so this was stopped and linezolid was resumed.
On [**5-19**], his intra-op wound culture from [**5-17**] was noted to be growing GNRs (in addition to MRSA); he was put on empiric meropenem, though this was narrowed to ciprofloxacin once the GNRs returned as pan-sensitive E. coli.
Following the wound closure there was no further bleeding and his hematocrit was stable.
He continued on IV Linezolid 600mg IV BID and PO Ciprofloxacin 500mg [**Hospital1 **].
ID recommended switching to PO linezolid 600mg [**Hospital1 **] and continuing PO cipro for a six week antibiotic course.
Dermatology was consulted for contact dermatitis on patient's left dorsal hand and intertriginious skin irritation and prescribed topical treatments with good effect.
On [**5-24**] he was found to have a mildly puritic erythemaous macularpapular coalescing rash on his bilateral upper extremities, chest, and abdomen after restarting tizanidine.
The tizanidine was subsequently discontinued.
The pain service was consulted for transition to PO pain medications given the patient's high narcotics requirement with Dilaudid PCA.
He was started on on Methadone 10 mg TID, MS Contin 60 mg Q8, Hydromorphone 4 mg 2-3 Tablets PO Q3H PRN, Acetaminophen 1000mg Q8, Ibuprofen 600 mg Q8H, and Gabapentin 800 mg TID with good pain control.
At the time of discharge, he had been afebrile for greater than 72 hours, was on PO Linezolid and Cipro, surveillance cultures were negative for greater than 10 days, had good pain control on PO pain medications, and was ambulating with assistance.
This was treated with an aggressive bowel regimen including PO naloxone and multiple doses of subcutaneous methylnaltrexone with some effect.
Also of note, the patient was tested for HIV Ab and HCV Ab given his IV drug use history.
The patient was informed of this and underwent RUQ ultrasound with plan to follow-up in Liver Clinic for further evaluation and treatment of his hepatitis.
