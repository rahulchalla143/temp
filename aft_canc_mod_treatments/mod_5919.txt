On [**5-28**] the patient returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit because of a desaturation of his oxygen to the 80's on two to three liters of nasal cannula.
The patient was put on noninvasive ventilation with a resulting blood gas of 7.30, 68 and 146.
A left thoracentesis was therefore performed with a white blood cell count of 278, red blood cell count of 8,667, protein of 2.7, LDH 160, consistent with a transudative process.
The patient continued to remain on noninvasive ventilation with a pressure support of 14 and a PEEP of 5 with gases in the range of pH of 7.33, pCO2 of 57 to 62 and paO2 of 144 to 157.
The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management of his respiratory distress as they were unable to wean him from the noninvasive ventilation in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.
Patient with history of three vessel disease (left anterior descending 80%, diagonal 50%, left circumflex 70%, right coronary artery 95%).
Patient has refused coronary artery bypass graft but was scheduled for cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital6 1708**].

The patient was on noninvasive ventilation with a pressure support of 15, a PEEP of 5, 50% FiO2.
The patient was diuresed with Lasix and Natrecor to a total of negative five liters which seemed to improve his congestive heart failure by chest x-ray and by physical examination and seemed to improve his hypoxic respiratory failure.
to evaluate the patient's acid base status on and off noninvasive ventilation in addition to awake and asleep.
The patient's pH ranged from 7.4 to 7.32 and his pCO2 ranged from 55 to 82 though there did not seem to be much of a correlation between whether he was on noninvasive ventilation and whether he was on face mask.
Therefore, the patient was started on continuous positive airway pressure ventilation overnight with a pressure of 8 starting on [**6-10**].
As the patient began to wake up and become less somnolent he also began to refuse his full face mask for noninvasive ventilation, however, he did do quite well on two liter nasal cannula for most of the day.
In addition, the patient was noted to have a metabolic alkalosis thought to be secondary to contraction alkalosis and he was given supplemental potassium chloride and three doses of acetazolamide in order to improve his metabolic alkalosis and, thereby, increase his drive to breathe.
In addition, the patient was maintained on oxygen by nasal cannula in order to maintain his sat no less than 88% and no greater than 93% in order to maintain his drive to breathe.
In addition, the patient was rate controlled on beta blockers in order to treat his diastolic dysfunction with the hopes of improving his respiratory status.
The patient was continued on his Lopressor and the doses titrated up in order to maintain normal sinus rhythm and the patient did have decreased episodes of supraventricular tachycardia with no episodes of atrial fibrillation during the last few days of his Intensive Care Unit stay.
Cardiology consult was obtained and did not recommend anticoagulation for the patient's paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Ectopy:  The patient did have two episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia which resolved with increased beta blocker doses and did not recur during his hospital stay.
The patient had an ejection fraction of 60% with severe diastolic dysfunction which was treated with Lasix as needed and now that the patient is uvolemic is being treated with metoprolol for rate control.
The patient is receiving aspirin, metoprolol and captopril.
It was decided not to give the patient an NG tube as that would interfere with his use of the noninvasive ventilation, therefore, it was planned for a midline catheter in order to give the patient TPN.
The patient was treated with levofloxacin empirically for possible pneumonia which was discontinued on [**6-8**] as a repeat chest x-ray showed no signs of infectious infiltrate.
