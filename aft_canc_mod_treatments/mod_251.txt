Na 144, K 2.5, Cl 101, HCO3 37, BUN 15, Cr 0.2, glucose 111   Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the ICU for management of altered mental status/respiratory distress: .
#Respiratory: Patient was intubated on arrival to the icu for airway protection.
Sputum cultures at that time grew PCP and patient was started on IV bactrim.
She was initially continued on her home dose of dexamethasone [**3-18**] as well.
Her steroid dose was increased to solumedrol 20mg every 8 hours.
The patient was initially started on gancicylovir for CMV therapy though she developed profound marrow suppression requiring change in therapy to foscarnet.
Due to electrolyte wasting associated with foscarnet, the patient required large potassium, phosphate and magnesium repletion daily.
Patient was persistently vent dependent with high FIO2 and PEEP requirements.
The patient completed therapy for PCP and continues on foscarnet therapy for CMV viremia.
#CMV viremia:  Patient found to have unexplained fevers early in course, so was started on Gancyclovir for a presumed CMV infection.
She was switched to Foscarnet therapy.
CMV later found to be sensitive to Gancyclovir, suggesting initial CMV blood test insensitive to effect of Gancyclovir on count (due to presumably very high initial CMV copies in blood).
She also received Cytogam per ID recommendations.
The patient will complete 21 days of additional foscarnet therapy at a reduced dose of 3000mg (reduced from 6000mg) when CMV viral load is zero.
The decision was made to treat the patient empirically with a course of IV nafcillin for her MSSA.
Therefore her coverage was switched to vancomycin.
PICC line was removed, and after over 3 weeks on vancomycin and 48 hours without spiking, patient was removed from Vanc.
PICC was pulled and patient was started on Cefepime for empiric coverage.
Decision was to treat with Cefepime for 14 day course.
Patient was continued on fentanyl patch, fentanyl gtt, and PRN bolus fentanyl while intubated.
Pain was controlled as above with addition of lidocaine patch to her clavicle with some relief.
# Nutrition: The patient had a PEG tube placed during hospitalization.
Patient was covered with IV antibiotics as above to treat MSSA bacteremia, VAP, and PCP.
