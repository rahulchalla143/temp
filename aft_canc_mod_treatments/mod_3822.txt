History of Present Illness: 44yo male w/ Down Syndrome, hepatitis C cirrhosis who comes in from liver transplant clinic with decompensated cirrhosis.
He says that [**Doctor First Name **], the house manager at his group home will be in tomorrow, and that she knows more about his medications and recent history.
He has since been on diuretic therapy with spironolactone 50 mg daily plus lasix 40 mg daily, though lasix was discontinued on [**2119-7-28**] due to elevated Cr and concern that it is exacerbating his chronic thrombocytopenia.
He was given vancomycin for potential LE cellulitis.
Neurological: CNII-XII intact, 5/5 strength, sensation grossly intact.
R. LOWER LEG PUNCH BIOPSY: Increased dermal capillaries with red cell extravasation and extensive (pan-dermal) hemosiderin deposition (see note).
Cirrhotic liver, with stigmata of portal hypertension including splenomegaly, ascites, and numerous splenorenal shunts and varices.
Brief Hospital Course: 45yo male with Down syndrome, hep C with cirrhosis currently undergoing evaluation for transplant who presents volume overloaded with ascites and lower extremity edema.
Fluid overload likely secondary to absence of diuretics for several weeks.
Patient was started on diuretic regimen of lasix and spironolactone however given bump in Cr diuretics were stopped.
Renal was consulted for further management and question of possible ultrafiltration (please see below).
Also during admission, ethics meeting was held and the decision to complete transplant evaluation was made.
Patient completed transplant evaluation during admission.
Patient was continued on propranolol for prophylaxis for variceal bleed.
He was also started on cipro for SBP ppx.
# LE skin changes and lesions - Pt has chronic venous stasis changes.
Patient underwent skin biopsy.
Initially he was started on vancomycin for possible cellulitis but this was discontinued as infection was unlikely.
#acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Baseline Cr around 1.3 with recent jump to 2.1 likely in the setting of diuresis and contrast from recent CT.
Patient was initially started on lasix of spironolactone.
However, given increase in Cr, renal was consulted for possible ultrafiltration.
Per renal recs he was started on torsemide [**Hospital1 **] with albumin.
He was evaluated for possible liver-kidney transplant and given 2 weeks of reduced GFR he was thought to meet criteria to qualify.
Patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics.
# Gout: continue allopurinol .
On [**2119-9-14**], he developed respiratory distress, with intermittent need for high flow supplemental oxygen and he was transferred to the SICU on the transplant surgery service.
On [**2119-9-16**], he was intubated for respiratory distress.
On [**2119-9-17**], he was started on CVVH for renal failure, and he became hypotensive requiring norepinephrine gtt.
His medical condition continued to deteriorate and ICU, hepatology, and liver transplant surgery teams agreed his medical derangements were unlikely to be reversed sufficiently to allow him to tolerate liver transplantation, to treat his underlying decompensated cirrhosis.
Inderal 20 mg twice daily.
Spironolactone 50 mg on hold.
Furosemide 20 mg on hold.
Zyloprim 200 mg once daily.
Tylenol p.r.n.
