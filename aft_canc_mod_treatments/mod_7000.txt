Overall patient had an uncomplicated laparoscopic/thoracoscopic esophagogastrectomy and feeding jejunostomy that was complicated by a pseudomonas pneumonia requiring prolonged intubation, antibiotics and chest tubes; atrial fibrillation requiring diltiazem drip; as well as persistent delirium.
1)GI:  Patient underwent laparoscopic/thoracoscopic esophagogastrectomy and feeding jejunostomy on the day of admission.

Psychiatry was consulted on [**2115-10-28**](POD#47) and formally diagnosed patient with delirium and recommended checking TSH, B12, folate, and head CT. All of these tests were unremarkable except for TSH which showed patient to be hypothyroid.
Sensorium began to clear on the night of [**2115-11-14**] (POD#64) with patient no longer requiring a sitter and increasing orientation.
4) Fluids/Electrolytes/Nutrition: Trophic tube feeds with Impact begun on [**2115-9-13**] via J-tube.
Bedside swallowing evaluations on [**2115-10-24**] demonstrated aspiration of thin and thick liquids and video swallow test also showed patient to be at risk for aspiration.
5) Urogenital: Foley pulled out by patient on POD#62 ([**2115-11-12**]) and remained out until discharge.
6) Cardiac: Developed atrial fibrillation in the early post-operative period which was treated with diltiazem gtt and Lopressor.
Patient developed prolonged QT most likely secondary to Haldol and had at least one run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.
Coumadin restated on [**2115-10-10**].

Vancomycin added on [**2115-9-17**] for high WBC count and concern about a wound cellulitis and discontinued on [**2115-9-30**].
Flagyl was started on [**9-21**] empirically for possible C. difficile colitis and was subsequently stopped on [**2115-9-24**] following three negative C. difficile stool toxin tests.
Gentamycin was discontinued on ID's recommendation on [**2115-10-13**] (POD#32) and Zosyn was discontinued on [**2115-10-21**] (POD#40) after 38 days following negative gram stain of pleural fluid.
Vancomycin and meropenem were restarted on [**2115-10-30**] (POD#50) empirically for respiratory distress.
Vancomycin discontinued after seven days and Meropenem after 8 days.
8) Tubes/Lines/Drains: Patient had multiple central lines, arterial lines, PICC lines, chest tubes, and JP drains.
