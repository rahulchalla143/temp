She was started on a diltiazem drip and on HD 1 her HR began to normalize.
She underwent an exploratory laporotomy, lysis of adheasions, repair of enterotomy, resection of small bowel, and right oopherectomy.
CT showed no abnormality and CT surgery signed off.
On POD 11 she developed diarrhea and the suspicion of repeat c.diff enterocolitis was confirmed.
ID was consulted and an antibiotic regimen of vanco PO and ceftriaxone IV was initiated.
These episodes occured on several nights, but seemed to be related to aspiration of thin liquids at night.
They confirmed that the WBCs were all mature forms, and a combination of hydroyurea and epo was started to help resolve the pt's anemia and high WBC count.
Heme-onc has reccommended that we continue the hydroxyurea and epo and follow cbcs with diff every four days or so.
Pt ultimately was dced to rehab after her coumadin was theraputic (INR=2.9), her SaO2 was stable, her diarrhea is tapering, her CHF is much improved (now minimal crackles in b/l bases, her UTI is being adequately treated, her anemia is resolving (hct 33.9), her WBC count is normalizing (last 12.2), her heart rate is controled (80s and 90s), and her creatinine is much improved (now 2.2).
