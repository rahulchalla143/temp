ERCP was performed for this, and she received a stent.
She initially required more medical reconditioning prior to being able to embark on a significant cancer resection operation.
Unfortunately, in the interim she became floridly septic from a stent migration process.
This was recovered and a new stent was placed.
The stents were not managing her stricture and jaundice problem and she required yet another stent placement.
Since this event was more self-limiting and less threatening,  plans were made for a Whipple procedure to follow within 7-10 days of the last event.
