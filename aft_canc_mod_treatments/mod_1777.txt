HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This a 64-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history significant for ovarian cancer of a papillary peritoneal serous type, metastatic, status post TAH, BSO in [**8-/2104**] with recurrence of disease [**8-/2105**], which was treated with subtotal colectomy and ileostomy with mucous fistula.
In the ambulance, she received Morphine and Lasix for presumed CHF without improvement in her symptoms.
Status post enterocutaneous fistula, treated by decreased p.o.
SVC syndrome in [**4-/2106**], status post stent placement.
Lasix 20 mg p.o.q.d.
Ativan 1 mg p.o.p.r.n.
Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o.q.d.
Zoloft 50 mg p.o.q.d.
Zestril 10 mg p.o.q.d.
Coumadin was held, pending possible IR intervention, and she was started on Heparin GTT on a weight-based scale.
Occlusion of the subclavian vein, brachiocephalic vein, and the brachiocephalic stent was noted.
A #4 French infusion catheter was placed from the left axillary vein to the superior vena cava and TPA infusion was begun.
She was then transferred to the MICU for TPA infusion and frequent blood draws.
She remained intubated during that time.
As stated above, on [**10-15**] the TPA was stopped and Heparin was continued for PTT of 60 to 80.
However, chest x-ray remained clear and she did not receive further antibiotics.
As above, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was continued on Heparin gtt.
until [**2106-10-27**] at 2 a.m.  Heparin was stopped at that point in preparation for a procedure, and then she was started on Lovenox 70 mg p.o.b.i.d.
and Coumadin 3 mg p.o.q.h.s.
Initially, it was thought that TPN could not longer go through these ports, but per hyperalimentation fellow, TPN was restarted.
At that time, sodium acetate was instituted, as well as IV fluids with 3 ampules of bicarbonate, and her serum bicarbonate level corrected.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was intubated in the MICU and required Ativan for continued sedation.
However, in the MICU, it was noted that she had prolonged effect from benzodiazepines and the benzodiazepines were discontinued.
She underwent intubation on [**2106-10-13**] during treatment of her SVC syndrome, and she was extubated on [**2106-10-16**].
She was gradually weaned off oxygen on the floor, and was tolerating room air with saturation 94% to 97%.
However, on [**2106-10-25**], she became acutely short of breath, and she was placed on four liters of nasal cannula.
She was given 20 mg IV Lasix without good diuresis.
She continues to be on four liters nasal cannula with saturation of 94% to 95%.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] underwent thoracentesis on [**2106-10-27**] to take off one liter off the right pleural effusion.
She tolerated this procedure well, but her O2 requirements did not improve.
As stated before, there was some question of aspiration pneumonia, and she was started prophylactically on Levaquin and Flagyl on [**2106-10-21**] for a total of a fourteen-day course.
The Ace inhibitor was continued through her stay, but discontinued on [**2106-10-22**] secondary to renal failure.
At that time, she was placed on Hydralazine and nitrates, which were held secondary to hypotension to systolic blood pressures of 60s to 70s.
She was, overall, fluid overloaded, but her blood pressure would not tolerate further Lasix.
However, her oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], was consulted and he recommended no further chemotherapy until she was better.
Continued abdominal pain suggested possible microperforation; she was started on Levaquin and Flagyl, as above.
She was given boluses of IV fluids and tolerated these well with some decrease in creatinine.
Repeat urinalysis continues to show fungal UTI treated with Fluconazole and continued nephrotic-range proteinuria.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had Hickman in place for TPN.
The Heparin was discontinued and Lovenox was started.
She continues to receive antibiotics through the second port of her Hickman.
The patient and the family had a meeting with case management and Hospice Julieknopf and it was decided that she would be moved either to hospice or other nursing home.
