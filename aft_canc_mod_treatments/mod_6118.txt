- Resited CVL to R IJ as site appeared erythematous and not fully covered by dressing.
- considered thoracentesis but held off given other potential etiologies.
?s pressure support was inc to 25 w/o benefit on RR, - Pt?????
?s lasix gtt she was already -2L,.
- LENI was negative - blood cx sent, more tylenol given - Pt was to get 25g albumin, but surgery decided to give 2 u PRBC instead, hct stable at 25 at the time.
agreed to adding Flagyl 500 IV q8, and surgery contd to want to r/o PE - bladder pressure 19 - stable - Pt became hypotensive to sbp 70s, map 40s, and gave 1L bolus, w/ 1unit PRBC being transfused during that time.
Pt still required levophed 0.3, and then added vasopresin 1.2 then 2.4.

- failed pressure support - tachypneic into 50s, agitated - weaned off pressors and sedation, consider haldol in AM.
Pt's tolerated extuabtion for 45min, then pt's 02 sat began to drop -> 90%, cpap and neb did not help -> reintubated and put on AC.
- Many attempts to get a-line unsuccesful, surgery even tried - ID: narrow abx when sensitivies return to cipro/flagyl or ctx/flagyl - Haldol prn started, continuing fentanyl - standing nebs put on - lasix 10, then 20 IV given prior to extubation - after reintubated put on lasix drip 1-3mg/hr ________________________________________________ [**3-18**] - On lasix gtt, then BP's dropped to 70s systolic.
