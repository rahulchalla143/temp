C-2 LESION PATH [**2101-7-12**]: DIAGNOSIS: C2 lesion (A-D): Metastatic large cell carcinoma consistent with lung origin, see note.
Note:  Tumor cells are positive for [**Last Name (un) **]-31, Keratin 7, focally positive for chromogranin an synaptophysin and negative for TTF-1, CK5-6, CK20 and p63.
If clinically warranted, correlation with cross-sectional imaging might be considered.
C-SPINE [**2101-7-11**]: FINDINGS: The patient is status post fusion of the occiput down to the level of C4.
Pre-vertebral soft tissues are grossly normal.
Cervical spine is not well seen below the level of C4.
Status post posterior occipital-C4 fusion without evidence of hardware migration into the spinal canal or neural foramina.
He underwent C-spine stabilization and biopsy of his C-spine mass which showed metastatic lung pathology.
He will need radiation of his lesions, which is planned for 5-10 days of treatment with simulation and first treatment on Monday [**2101-7-18**] at 1030hrs.
In addition we started pt on dexamethasone 4mg Q6H to prevent swelling and further CNS damage.
He will continue this dose until his oncologist decided otherwise.
We controlled his pain on oxycodone 5mg Q6H PRN, but this does sedate patient, so we tried to avoid it as much as possible.
Patient will be seen in thoracic oncology clinic on [**7-28**] for possible chemotherapy treatment.
Plan for treatment to be determined prior to clinic visit, but after pt has completed his radiation course.
# ORTHO: Pt s/p c-spine stabilization on [**7-11**], biopsy was obtained intraoperatively.
Drain removed, dressing in place.
We started him on metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] to help control his tachycardia that we felt may have been related to his hyperthyroidism (see below).
This will need to be followed as pt recovers from his acute illness  # PULM: Pt with known COPD, so we put him on albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
We were unable to continue his mom[**Name (NI) 6474**], because we do not have this on formulary.
