Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 23050**] is a 58 yo male with past medical history significant for Hodgkin's disease s/p splenectomy, CAD, and hypothyroidism who presents with babesiosis & Lyme disease.
#.Babesiosis: Mr. [**Known lastname 23050**] was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital1 2292**] with diagnosis of babesiosis complaining of fevers, rigors, myalgias and headache.
Prior to admission, PCP had given patient quinine 650 mg PO plus IV clindamycin 600mg, but per ID recommendation, antibiotics were changed to atovaquone 750mg and azithromycin 750mg due to side effect profile of quinine/clindamycin combination and equivalent efficacy of atovaquone/azithromycin regimen.
ID recommended RBC exchange transfusion given asplenia and rising parasitemia.
A code blue was called and patient was stabilized with benadryl, solumedrol, demerol, and albuterol.
ID consult suggested elevated LFT could be a natural progression of infection (see below for details) or a side effect of antibiotics, since atovaquone has a known risk of hepatotoxicity and azithromycin is hepatically metabolized.
Azithromycin dosage was consequently lowered to 250mg.
The patient remained clinically stable despite these laboratory findings, and was discharged on a planned two week course of azithromycin, atovoquine and doxycycline.
Patient was started on doxyclycine 100 mg and instructed to continue for a total 14 day course at discharge.
Patient will be informed of results by telephone and encouraged to follow-up with dermatology for total body skin examination.
Possible Anaplasmosis: Patient was tested for anaplasma phagocytophilum co-infection.
