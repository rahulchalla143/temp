Immediately postoperatively, the patient was relatively comfortable with an epidural catheter in place for pain control.
He was started on clear liquids on postoperative day #2 as well as restarted on his whole medications.
Due to the large volume, he was started on intravenous fluid replacement to prevent dehydration.
His Foley catheter was removed on postoperative day #7, however, he failed to void.
Urology was consulted and a 18 French Foley was placed with a PVR of 190 cc.
A small red rubber catheter was placed in the stoma with some relief, however, the patient remained distended.
His partial small bowel obstruction was slow to resolve where on postoperative day #18 he was started on clears with continued decompression through his ostomy via the red rubber catheter.
He was made NPO and resuscitated with intravenous fluids, however, later that evening, his O2 sats were noted to decrease to the 80s on room air.
On rectal examination, he was found to have an area of anterior separation of his anastomosis and about 30 cc of serosanguinous fluid was drained.
He was kept on broad spectrum antibiotics and close observation.
During this time, while he was NPO, he was also started on TPN for nutritional support.
The first around the 17th and the 18th with the initial culture growing E-coli and Morganella Morgani and subsequent cultures with no growth.
