FEMUR AP/LAT:  Multiple views of the right hip and proximal femur.
Status post ORIF of the right proximal femur including the femoral neck with  hooks, plate and screws.
In this patient status post right femur fixation surgery, there are expected surgical changes and moderate soft tissue edema.
ABD SUPINE/ERECT:  In comparison with the CT scout of [**5-10**], there is continued and possibly even more prominent extreme dilatation of a gas-filled [**Date Range 499**].
1L NS was hung wide open and ortho was asked to evaluate post-op site for internal bleeding.
# Right femur fracture s/p ORIF: Found to have right leg pain with xrays showing a displaced proximal femur fracture.
She was taken for repair on [**2148-5-7**] which was complicated only by 500mL blood loss necessitating 2 unit PRBC transfusion for Hct drop from 29 to 24 post-op.
Pain well-controlled with tylenol and pt resting comfortably and denying pain.
Pt started on lovenox 40mg subcutaneous qHS after surgery and should continue this for 1 month.
She was started on calcium and vitamin D and is recommended to start a bisphosphonate after at least month from surgery.
Started on bactrim for 7 days.
Continued amiodarone 100mg [**Hospital1 **] and continued metoprolol 100mg daily.
She was controlled on an aggressive bowel regimen at the nursing home, often turned side to side to relief the gas, and occasionally rectal tube has been needed.
Continued senna, miralax, and bisacodyl PR in house and added docusate.
Having regular BM in house but abdomen markedly distended (denied pain) so KUB ordered after surgery in PACU to eval but was mostly unchanged from prior imaging and shows no free air.
CT abdomen and pelvis showed severely dilated loops of bowel to as large as 16cm yet patient was without abdominal pain, fevers, white count, or HD compromise to suggest colitis or megacolon.
GI performed a colonic decompression by sigmoidoscopy and temporary placement of rectal tube with frequent repositioning to help relieve gas.
Rectal tube removed after about 24 hours because pt was stooling around tube (?blockage in tube), and she continued having BM after removal of tube.
Per GI she can continue use of rectal prn with frequent positioning at the nursing home if needed, which was her regimen prior to admission as well.
