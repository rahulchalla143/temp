She was found to have a soft tissue infection lateral to the esophagus that likely represents microperforation, for which she was started on abx, and she required surgical tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction caused by her esophageal cancer.
Evaluation as to the cause of tachycardia has included TSH (low normal), with fT4 pending; echo (nml LV and RV function, no echocardiographic signs of hemodynamically significant PE); ABG 7.46/41/114 was with pt breathing room air for 10 minutes, indicating that there is no apparent A-a gradient; a random cortisol level was low, but responded appropriately to cosyntropin.

# PEG tube site candidiasis   Social History: The patient lives in [**Location 686**], MA with her cousin [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], who is her HCP.
-DTRs: 2+ biceps, triceps, No foley catheter/tracheostomy/PEG/ventilator support/chest tube/colostomy Psychiatric:  Very limited affect with rare brightening.
PEG in place in LUQ EXT: No C/C/E, no palpable cords NEURO: alert, oriented to person, place, and time.
There is induration of the adjacent tissues, which could be a consequence of local infection, but also could arise as a result of prior radiation.

The surgical margin of resection appears to be free of tumor.
A frozen section was performed on tissue.
It consists of a wedge resection of lung measuring 6.0 x 3.4 x 1.5 cm with a stapled margin that measures 8.0 cm in length.
Given these findings, throacic surgery was consulted and it was felt that the patient would benefit from tracheostomy placement for airway protection.
A trach was placed by thoracics on [**2130-12-8**] which was tolerated well.
Speech and swallow followed for assessment for passy muir valve.
[**12-6**] - ENT - advised continued MICU care, trachea 3 mm at narrowest point and supraglottic edema, R vocal cord paralysis - Thoracics consult- likely not a tear; advised barium swallow and broad spectrum coverage, ddx perforation vs TE fistula; - Pt did not tolerate barium swallow - Added Vanco/Levo/Flagyl/Fluconazole - MR Neck - read PENDING (wet read by surgery - no ET fistula, no extaluminal air) - TFs - restart Ensure - Evaluated for worsening stridor at 0400; Inspiratory stridor noted on exam in all lung fields, but pt saturating well.
- Unless team observes persistent stridor, plan for continuing Abx, no surgical (trach) intervention at this time.
- had rhoncorous [**Month/Year (2) 1440**] sounds, 3am, cleared on own.
Weaned off vent overnight and placed on trach mask.
[**12-9**] - c/od but no bed - ENT s/o - CXR shows trach well palced - tolerated trach proecedure well - no stridor, no n/v - restarted tube feeds - thoracics - 2 wks antibx but will follow on the floor - patient somewhat confused about cancer dx and prognosis - will need to have [**Doctor Last Name **]/[**Doctor Last Name **] to explain to patient what to expect for the future - continues to be tachycardic .
12/14-15/08 -Assessment update: noting low suspicion for esophagael cancer per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 174**].
-Refusing depression meds, psychiatry, social work -Speech and Swallow tomorrow -Gave 1 L for tachychardia .
-Cortisol noted to be quite low.
Will likely need to start treatment steroids s/p test.
-In general, "still"-appearing, as if in pain, but repeatedly denies.
She was found to have a soft tissue infection lateral to the esophagus that likely represents microperforation, for which she was started on abx, and she required surgical tracheostomy for upper airway obstruction caused by her esophageal cancer.
Evaluation as to the cause of tachycardia has included TSH (low normal), with fT4 pending; echo (nml LV and RV function, no echocardiographic signs of hemodynamically significant PE); ABG 7.46/41/114 was with pt breathing room air for 10 minutes, indicating that there is no apparent A-a gradient; a random cortisol level was low, but responded appropriately to cosyntropin.
The following section summarizes the patients OMED course including VATS and SICU transfer: .
40 y/o F with esophageal SCC s/p XRT, s/p tracheostomy for upper airway compromise with parapharyngeal abscess, now s/p VATs for LUL cavitary lesion and found to have metastatic esophageal CA.
Metastatic Esophageal CA: Patient s/p chemo and radiation.
The patient underwent thoracentesis on [**1-2**] with 700cc of clear yellow fluid drained without complication.
A chest tube was placed.
The patient briefly required pressers while in the SICU.
s/p Trach: The patient was trached on [**12-8**] secondary to airway compromise.
The patient did not tolerate a PMV on [**1-2**] following completion of a 28 day course of Unasyn and Clindamycin (previously Augmentin).
On [**1-4**] respiratory therapy attempted to use inhaled fluticasone to improve her symptoms.
The patient was placed empirically on Cefepime on [**1-15**], this was later changed to Levaquin upon discharge for a planned 10 day total duration of antibiotics.
This was changed to Unasyn / Clindamycin for which she subsequently completed 28 days of treatement.
There was question of benefit of higher transfusion threshold to reduce tachycardia.
Responds well to fluid bolus when systolics drift down to 70s.
Was briefly on pressers while in the unit, now weaned off.
Pain: The patients pain was well-controlled with gabapentin and methadone.
The patient was written for Morphine PRN.
# Depression: The patient remains on nortriptyline for depressed mood and will not take additional treatment.
Likely that some of this is related to coping with general medical illness as well as underlying depression and being away from her children.
