Steroids were given IV and then dosage was decreased and eventually switched to a PO regimen, for which dose will be tapered upon outpatient follow-up.
Keppra is being given per patient's home dose for seizure prophylaxis.

If diarrhea continues upon discharge, recommend stool studies and C. diff testing.
Etiology may be due to antibiotic use.
