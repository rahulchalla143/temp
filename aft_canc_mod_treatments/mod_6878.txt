[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 80901**]/mtd    SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: Esophagectomy, periazygos tissue.
DIAGNOSIS:    I.  Esophagus and proximal stomach, esophagectomy (A-X, Z-AK):  Adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, arising in a background of Barrett's esophagus with dysplasia; see synoptic report.
Esophagus: Resection Synopsis   MACROSCOPIC  Specimen Type:  Esophagectomy.
Additional Pathologic Findings:  Intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, mild esophagitis; active.
Postoperative changes following esophagectomy and pull-up procedure, with no evidence of mediastinal extraluminal collections.
INDICATION: Status post laparoscopic esophagectomy.
Upper mediastinal drain, and overlying surgical staples are unchanged.
Cardiomediastinal contours, and neoesophagus are not significantly changed.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient went to the operating room for his minimally invasive esophagectomy and jejunostomy-tube placement by Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **].
Intraoperatively there was trouble placing a foley catheter and urology was called for cystoscopy, foley placement, and urethral stricture dilation at bladder neck.
He subsequently underwent the above mentioned the procedure and was admitted to the SICU for observation.
On [**6-19**] he self-discontinued his nasogastric tube and was noted to be in atrial fibrillation which required a diltiazem drip.
On [**6-20**] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] replaced his nasogastric tube without significant event.
He was placed on a lasix drip for fluid overload, and an echo was performed without significant result.
He was started on trophic tube feeds at that point.
His lasix drip continued and he was noted to have som mild amount of erythema around the chest tube site.
On [**6-22**] his lasix drip was weaned off, and a CT chest was performed to assess for leak.
On [**6-24**] he was d/c'ed off his diltiazem drip and was switched to PO.
His Chest tube was placed to waterseal.
He was NPO the entire time with tube feeds and he will remain that way at least until follow up.
