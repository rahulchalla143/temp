Patient was rehydrated with IVF and blood pressure meds were initially held.
PICC Line placed [**8-18**] for initiation of chemo.
Given elevated uric acid, allopurinol 300mg qd was continued, and patient was administered chemotherapy per protocol.
Patient tolerated the chemotherapy well, with no nausea/vomiting while tolerating a cardiac diet, and remained afebrile.
However, he did develop some loose stools prior to discharge, which postponed his discharge as there was concern for patient having to rush to bathroom, resulting in a fall which would be extremely traumatic given his lytic bone lesions.
This diarrhea was thought to be secondary to an aggressive bowel regimen as patient had been previously constipated, and patient was given some loperamide.
Twenty-four hours after completing the chemotherapy protocol, the patient was started on Filgrastim at 300mcg.
In addition, his decadron was weaned down slowly (given his age) from 20mg-->10mg->4mg, then was discontinued.
Given NTG SL x 2 with resolution of chest pain, then became hypotensive w/ BP in 80's/50's.
Pt received fluid boluses of NS and was given 15mg diltiazem which improved BP to 90's/50's-70's and decreased HR to 90's, remained in AFib.
Was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring, where he was started on Amiodarone 400mg TID (intent for 3 days, then decrease to 400mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 weeks).
Cardiology was consulted and recommended, continuing Amiodarone 400mg TID x 3 days (day 1 = [**8-18**]), then changing to [**Hospital1 **] x 1 week (stop date [**8-28**]), then change to 400mg daily for one month, at which time patient has a scheduled follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
CAD s/p CABG/stents: Patient failed to show evidence of acute MI as source of AFib (cardiac enzymes negative) but the question of cardiac ischemia given EKG findings remained.
Pt was without chest pain after that initial episode which resolved with SL NTG x 2.
Patient was started on metoprolol for rate control (hr consistently in the 50-60's) and was closely monitored for chest pain, as well as for rhythm by telemetry.
Plavix was held for chemotherapy but aspirin was continued.
Lipitor and folic acid was continued, but gemfibrozil was discontinued due to effect on liver and chemotherapy agents that patient received.
Fluid status:  Patient developed significant lower extremity edema once IVF started for chemo, and it was discovered that patient had been on lasix 20mg daily at home.
Therefore, he was given lasix 20mg IV intermittently with good response, and was restarted on his home lasix dose on [**8-21**].
DM:  No history of DM but given that patient was to be started on steroids and receive chemotherapy, he was covered with a RISS, which was discontinued on day prior to discharge.
Parkinson's Disease: The patient was continued on Carbidopa/Levadopa and Entacapone.
Finasteride and terazosin were initially held, but hytrin was then restarted at half of patient's home dose to avoid any lightheadedness/precipitate falls.
