Also given levoquin given WBC of 16.6. .
She was continued on IV PPI and underwent EGD that showed Grade 4 esophagitis with contact bleeding in the lower third of the esophagus.

After CXR revealed NG tube in esophagus this was removed.
CXR- NG tube is curled in the esophogus .
She was kept NPO and given IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] per GI.
GI recommended QID sucralfate and [**Hospital1 **] PPI.
Given her achalasia and poor PO intake they recommended that the patient receive TPN for nutritional repletion given low albumin.
Once nutritionally replete may need G-tube in medium term.
She was advanced to a regular diet and started on TPN following PICC placement.
Her hct trended down to 24.9 and given her cardiac history she was transfused one unit of packed RBCs.
Levofloxacin was discontinued given no clear infectious source.
There is a new indwelling PICC line as above" and the leukocytosis upon discharge is being attributed to a UTI.
We started a course of Bactrim and she should continue this for 3 days and have follow up U/A and cultures in a week's time.
Resolved with hydration so it was thought to be secondary to hypovolemia.
# Brain Mass- Worked up recently completed.
Of note, sutures removed by neurosurg on day of discharge.
# CHF- EF 30-35%.
-- Watch for need of lasix given fluid resusitation .
Iron supplemntation was restarted following endoscopy.
# FEN- Patient was initially kept NPO for her procedure.
It was felt that she will likely need a feeding tube for nutritional support as she is unable to meet her needs by mouth, however GI did not want to place a tube while her nutritional status was so poor.
Therefore, a PICC was placed for TPN.
She will likely need a few weeks of TPN to improve her nutritional status prior to g-tube placement.
