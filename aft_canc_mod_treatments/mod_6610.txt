Admission Date:  [**2133-1-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-2-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2053-1-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**] Chief Complaint: temp to 105, ERCP  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP IR placement of biliary drain  History of Present Illness: 80 y/o M w/history of diabetes, gastric cancer, with recent development of painless jaundice, GNR bacteremia, biliary obstruction, and suspected cholangitis, who presents to the hospitalist service s/p ERCP.
He was xferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to control the hyperthermia   Past Medical History: 1. parkinsons disease 2. diabetes 3. h/o gastric adenoCa diagnosed 6 y/ago 4. s/p colostomy 5. htn 6. h/o TIA 7. h/o chronic anemia 8. h/o GI bleed 9. h/o appy 10. h/o CHF- undocumented type 11. h/o large bowel obstruction [**2-14**] sigmoid volvulus in 10'[**31**].
Ground-glass attenuation and additional biapical centrilobular opacity most likely reflects a component of superimposed pulmonary edema.
Right PICC extends through the right heart, with tip situated in the right hepatic vein.
He then had IR guided common bile duct stent placement.
Given progressively worsening medical conditions, the family decided to make him comfort measures only and stop dialysis on [**2133-2-5**].
Oncology consultation deferred during admission given patient's established relationship with oncologist at [**Hospital3 635**] hospital, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 7049**], and family's wish to pursue further eval and treatment for recurrent gastric cancer closer to home.
He required a second IR procedure with extension of the CBD stent due to persistant obstruction from the duodenal mass.
Following the second procedure the external drain was removed and his total bilirubin has continued to trend down and he has remained afebrile suggesting that he now has unobstructed internal biliary drainage.
He was treated with levofloxacin (start date: [**1-21**]) and fluconazole (start date: [**1-31**]) for GNR bactermia and sparse growth of [**Female First Name (un) **] from his biliary fluid.
3)Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease: baseline creatinine 1.5.
In addition, he also had worsening repiratory status and developing oliguria which led to initiation of dialysis on [**2133-2-4**].
In further discussions with family, goals of care were changed to CMO on [**2133-2-5**] and dialysis was stopped.
He was treated with 13 day course of vancomycin and zosyn for aspiration pneumonia.
Given these findings, pneumothorax felt most likely to be a complication of CBD stent placement.
Chest tube was considered for treatment of his complicated effusion, however no further intervention was pursued as family decided to change to comfort measures only, with no further invasive procedures.
He was not started on anticoagulation given multiple procedures.
Diltiazem was stopped once made CMO.
Felt most likely due to gastritis/trauma from NG tube placement.
He was treated with twice daily PPI and bleeding stopped without intervention.
He was initially started on dialysis however this was stopped due to decision for comfort measures only.
9)Coagulopathy - INR elevated as high as 2.2 during this admission, felt to be due to nutritional deficiencies and antibiotic therapy.
Given IR procedures he was treated with IV vitamin K 1mg x1 and transfused 2 units FFP.
Also has a component of chronic anemia treated with epoetin prior to admission and during admission.
11) parkinsons: sinemet was stopped once he was made CMO as he was no longer taking PO medications safely.
