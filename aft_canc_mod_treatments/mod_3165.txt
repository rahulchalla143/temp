Admission Date:  [**2138-12-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2138-12-28**]  Date of Birth:   [**2071-8-9**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital1 212**] MEDICINE  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old woman who was transferred from the MICU after a rigid bronchoscopy and stent placement in her left main stem bronchus on [**2138-12-16**] for a near total occlusion due to adenocarcinoma.
Over the past several weeks, she has had multiple admissions to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response; she was started on digoxin, Diltiazem, and flecainide.
She received bronchoscopy on [**2138-12-13**] which revealed the mass occluding 90% of the bronchus.
The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for rigid bronchoscopy and stent placement.
A Cardiology consult recommended Amiodarone and long-term warfarin for the atrial fibrillation with discontinuation of the flecainide.
The patient was started on clindamycin and levofloxacin for possible postobstructive pneumonia.
A bronchoscopy with stent placement was performed on [**2138-12-16**] without complications.
Metoprolol 25 mg p.o.
Amiodarone 400 mg p.o.
Warfarin 2.5 mg q.h.s.
Fluticasone 440 b.i.d.
Salmeterol two puffs b.i.d.
Albuterol p.r.n.
Levofloxacin 500 q.d., day number three of 14.
Clindamycin 300 q. six, day number three of 14.
Tylenol p.r.n.
Heparin 5,000 subcutaneously q.
Protonix 40 mg q.d.
Levothyroxine 75 micrograms q.d.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, with decreased bowel sounds.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred from the MICU and continued on her medications for pneumonia and atrial fibrillation.
On [**2138-12-19**], the patient underwent an atrial flutter ablation procedure.
Telemetry monitoring after this procedure revealed intermittent periods of sinus rhythm with atrial fibrillation.
On [**2138-12-21**], the patient dropped her oxygen saturation to 83 to 85% on 6 liters nasal cannula and was placed on a nonrebreather mask.
On further consultation with the Electrophysiology Service, they recommended continuing her Amiodarone at a dose of 400 mg t.i.d.
The patient and her husband expressed a desire to be transferred back to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for further treatment for her lung cancer.
She underwent debulking of the tumor and replacement of the stent in a prolonged and difficult procedure.
The patient was subsequently placed on a morphine drip for comfort.
The Palliative Care Service was consulted and per their recommendations, nonessential medications were discontinued, Amiodarone was continued for increasing the chance of sinus rhythm to maximize comfort, and a scopolamine patch was started in addition to the morphine drip.
