Pt was initially started on ciprofloxacin for UTI and when blood cultures grew out GNR zosyn was added.
She was transitioned to 4L NC and she stabilized.
Lasix was held for a couple of days, but patient was never in a positive fluid balance.
Also, it was felt this tap would only help her baseline breathing and not prevent her from flashing in the future.
Her multiple episodes of flash pulmonary edema were relieved with lasix, nitroglycerin paste, metoprolol, and nebulizers.
Cardiology was consulted to help with maximizing blood pressure control in the setting of severe diastolic heart failure.
Her regimen ultimately included 30 mg Imdur at dinner, Metoprolol Succinate 300 mg daily at breakfast, Lisinopril 40 mg daily at lunch, Verapamil SR 120 mg daily at bedtime, Lasix 80 mg po daily .
After this regimen was optimized by staggering throughout the day and night, it was felt the patient was stable for discharge to a skilled nursing facility.
It was decided to discontinue some medications that will not benefit the patient in the short term, such as calcium, iron, vitamin D, alendronate, multivitamins, and atorvastatin.
The patient does not want to come back to the hospital, so it is hopeful that this new regimen will be helpful.
This regimen includes 80 mg po Lasix, Nitro-paste, Liquid morphine 5 mg, and Nebulizers.
# CAD: pt was continued on aspirin 81 mg, Lisinopril was increased to 40 mg, and Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg TID was changed to Metoprolol Succinate 300 mg daily.
# RECENT PE: pt was admitted with supra therapeutic INR and Coumadin was held.
Since the patient has a high likelihood of lung cancer, it was felt enoxaparin was a better medication for anti-coagulation.
The patient was continued on Enoxaparin 70 mg daily for five days and placed back on her coumadin 1 mg daily.
She was started on daily iron supplementation.
Iron was ultimately discontinued as this will not likely effect patient's short term prognosis.
Patient and family opted to hold treatment for this.
Further management will be deferred to the outpatient.
# Dyslipidemia: Stopped Atorvastatin during course of admission as patient will not likely benefit from this medication in the short term.
