Intubation 3.
Right IJ central venous line placement  History of Present Illness: 67 yo M h/o CAD, CHF, presented to the ED with hemoptysis.
He was empirically started on levofloxacin after a CXR showed concern for PNA.
In [**Location (un) 620**], intial vital signs were 98.7 92 18 80/53 91% which decreased to 88% on RA, ultimately placed on a non-rebreather with improvement of his oxygenation.
He was started on cefepime and azithromycin.
Mildly relieved with IV morphine.
1 SL NTG did not help.

Recommended continued followup until resolution.
The right internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the SVC.
There is complete intubation of the right main bronchus.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 year-old man who presented with hemoptysis and transient hypotension with concern for lung mass.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], ultimately received 2 units of prbcs, central line was placed and transiently started on levophed which was quickly weaned off after volume resuscitation.
He required no further blood products.
He remained right mainstem intubated after bronch overnight.
The tube was pulled back to trachea and he was quickly extubated the same day without incident.
This was controlled with PO codeine and lidocaine nebulizers.
He also required supplemental oxygen with a shovel mask initially, which was weaned down to 5 liters NC prior to transfer to the floor.
Nevertheless, it was felt best to discharge him with home oxygen as a temporizing measure - until he is able to clear his airways fully of old blood and secretions.
He was empirically treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for presumed CAP.
He completed a five-day course of azithromycin in house and will take two more days of cefpodoxime.
Furthermore, he would not be a candidate for anticoagulation given the recent episode of massive hemoptysis.)
# Acute Renal Failure: Felt to be secondary to pre-renal azotemia in setting of blood loss.
Initially Cr was 1.6, which quickly resolved to 1.0 after receiving IVFs and prbcs.
Treated with tylenol and lidocaine patches with good relief.
# Hypertension: Hypotensive on presentation requiring brief use of Levophed and phenylephrine (as above).
# Coronary artery disease: Patient continued on home atorvastatin and zetia.
