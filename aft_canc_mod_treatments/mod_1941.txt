Carboplatin [**8-19**].
4 L NC placed.
Referred to the ED from outpatient chemotherapy session due to shortness of breath, chest pain, low O2 sats, tachycardia and hypotension.
She was given approx 2L NS, Cefepime 2gm IV, and Tylenol.
She was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who performed an exploration with bronchoscopy in early [**2103-3-26**].
Left pneumonectomy was performed and path consistent with adenoid cystic carcinoma.
She received postoperative radiation.

She received postoperative radiation.
She was then started on regimen of doxorubicin and cisplatin for goal of 4 cycles.
2 cycles of carboplatin/taxol for stabilization of liver lesions.
Most recently, from [**2109-2-23**] until [**2109-4-25**] she received four cycles of dose-reduced cisplatin and Navelbine with stable disease radiographically, but resolution of arm pain and improvement in arm strength.
CT torso from [**2109-9-19**] showed progression in the liver and kidney, and she was started on gemcitabine on [**2109-10-8**].
Her schedule has been changed to three week cycles with gemcitabine given on days 1 and 8.
-low-dose Taxotere in [**11-28**] -four cycles of cisplatin and Adriamycin from [**10-28**] to [**12-30**] with initial radiographic improvement, but a CT scan in [**9-29**] revealed progression in the lungs and liver.
-Two cycles of carboplatin and Taxol were given ([**9-29**]) with stabilization of her liver lesions but continued progression in the left lung - four cycles of dose-reduced cisplatin and Navelbine ([**Date range (1) 31896**]) - Gemcitabine ([**2109-10-8**]); limited by progressive myelosuppresion - Carboplatin in [**7-/2110**] .
Strenght [**2-27**] throughout.
Studies: CXR ([**8-26**]):Changes from prior left-sided pneumonectomy with calcification along the remaining cystic cavity within the left hemithorax is unchanged when compared to [**2110-4-1**].
There was mild-to-moderate premature spillover into the piriform sinuses with thin liquids via spoon and cup in mixed consistencies.
Mild aspiration of occurred with cup sips of thin liquids before swallow with her head held in the neutral position.
Mild penetration was also seen with thin liquids during swallow.
A 13 mm barium pill was administered with holdup at the distal esophagus.
Mild-to-moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia with moderately impaired bolus control for thin liquids with mild-to-moderate premature spillover into the piriform sinuses with all thin liquids with the head in neutral position.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 50 year old female with metastatic adenoid cystic lung cancer who presented with shortness of breath, tachycardia and hypotension found to have new right upper and lower lung opacities suspicious for pneumonia.
Initially there was no history aspiration, as she had nausea with no vomiting after chemotherapy, however speech and swallow studies demonstrated aspiration, so she was also treated for an aspiration pneumonia.
- Patient's shortness of breath resolved during her stay, and nasal cannula oxygen was weaned.
- She was initially treated with Cefepime and Vancomycin, then switched over to levofloxacin and flagyl, and eventually switched to oral antibiotics at time of discharge.
- Nebulized bronchodilators were also used to help clear secretions.
#) Hypotension: Initially there was concern for sepsis, however, the patient's blood pressure stabilized in response to fluid boluses.
#) History pulmonary embolism and cerebral vein thrombosis: Patient has been on Coumadin for antiocoagulation, which was recently held due to supratherapeutic INR.
- At her follow up appointment just after discharge, her INR was to be re-checked, and Coumadin re-started as necessary.
Patient recently completed course of carboplatin on [**2110-8-19**].
She has received chemotherapy, surgical resection and radiation, however continues to have spread of disease.
Currently full code - Supportive care was continued, and follow-up with oncology clinic was arranged for just after discharge.
- She continued on her home dose of Fentanyl for pain control, along with oral morphine and neurontin.
#) Tachycardia: Patient has had history of baseline tachycardia, with heart range in 120's.
- Patient's tachycardia improved with fluid resuscitation and treatment of her infection, and was in the 90's-110's range at time of discharge.
#) GERD: She continued on a proton pump inhibitor.
- Restarted megace for assistance with appetite, discontinued dexamethasone as no longer had nausea.
- Speech and swallow evaluated the patient and assisted with evaluating her dysphagia.
- MRI did not demonstrate any central process responsible for dysphagia.
- Gastroenterology consulted to evaluate and assist with coordinating outpatient EGD with possible esophageal stent placement for her dysphagia and aspiration.
Follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for evaluation and possible placement of a stent to help was in process of being set up at time of discharge, and the gastroenterology service was to contact the patient.
#) Prophylaxis: Patient received proton pump inhibitor, initially subcutaneous heparin (which was held due to elevated coagulation studies, which resolved with d/c of heparin), and a bowel regimen.
