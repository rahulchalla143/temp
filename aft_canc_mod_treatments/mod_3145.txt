She was put Keppra and dexamethasone and was A+Ox3 on the morning of the 6th.
On monitors she was tachy to 200s and it appeared to be a wide complex tachycardic and possibly torsades so she recieved 1gm of magnesium and a code blue was called to get anesthesia for probable cardioversion.
She was given 150mg IV amiodarone over 10 min and started on an amiodarone drip at 1mg/min and transferred to the MICU.
She was started on lidocaine drip.
She was amio-loaded again with 300IV and then drip of 1mg/min and continued on procainamide drip 8mg/min for an hour overlap and was transferred to the CCU for further management.

The procainamide was stopped, metoprolol 25mg QID was started, and amiodarone drip continued.
On [**9-6**] AM the VT caused HD instability with unresponsiveness and required cardioversion and amiodarone boluses.
