HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56 year-old female with a history of stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer with brain metastasis diagnosed in [**2103-2-17**], SVC syndrome and coronary artery disease, status post a myocardial infarction who presented to the Emergency Room with acute shortness of breath on [**2103-4-23**].
The patient was escalated to BiPAP and then mask ventilation and eventually was intubated.
The pericardial drain was placed for pericardial tamponade and 260 cc of pericardial fluid was removed.
The patient was resuscitated with this drainage and with 3 amps of epinephrine.
Patient was subsequently put on dopamine.
At the time of admission she was unresponsive off sedation with blood pressures in the 80s on Dopamine at maximum dose and was saturating 80 percent with an FIO2 of 100 percent on her ventilator.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Is significant for non-small cell lung cancer stage 4 diagnosed in [**2103-2-17**], for brain metastasis being treated with radiation treatment in [**2103-3-20**], status post Taxol and carboplatin treatment in [**2103-3-20**].
She had superior vena cava syndrome also treated with radiation treatment on [**2103-4-16**].
Her history aside from her oncologic history includes hypertension, coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction, osteoporosis, esophagitis and status post appendectomy and status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Included atenolol 50 mg p.o.
q.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o.
q.d., Prevacid 40 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Decadron 2 mg every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, MSIR 15 mg p.o.
q.d., Oxycodone 5 to10 mg p.o.
4 to 6 p.rn., Levaquin 500 mg p.o.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: the patient had a heart rate of 120 on dopamine 5 mcg drip, blood pressure was 80/50 and respirations - no spontaneous respiration, saturation of 84 percent on the ventilator.
Neck: right internal jugular line in place.
Abdomen: positive bowel sounds, soft, obese, pericardial drain in place.
Cardiac catheterization results showed tamponade with 200 cc removed, diffuse coronary artery disease and status post brief cardiac arrest.
Therefore, she was continued on minimal PEEP.
For her pericardium the patient had a drain in place and with repeat echocardiograms it was found that the drain was not putting out much output and the effusion remained small after being tapped.
Therefore, the drain was pulled.
Therefore, the Dopamine was weaned off and Levophed was begun with good results.
The patient was slowly titrated off the Levophed and continued to do well.
There was a question of congestive heart failure on chest x-ray and her CVP was elevated.
Her electrolytes were supportively managed and prior to her transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit she was given Lasix multiple times to improve her urine output and diuresis.
After she was extubated and off pressors she had episodes of agitation which required benzodiazepines and Haldol.
However, it was discovered that the patient had been taking benzodiazepines such as Xanax at home and therefore she was started on low dose benzodiazepines throughout her stay with good effect.
In terms of her oncologic issues the patient was seen by both oncology and by radion oncology who wished to continue to stage the patient and to continue her treatment.
However, the CTA was obtained for staging purposes and she was subsequently stabilized in preparation for treatment.
For prophylaxis the patient was given Protonix to prevent any gastrointestinal bleeding.
She also was given subcutaneous heparin and Pneumoboots after having negative lower extremity Doppler examination.
For access the patient had a Swan in place in her groin which was pulled, she had a right internal jugular and she had an arterial line which was placed.
