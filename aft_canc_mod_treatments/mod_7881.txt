BAL CULTURE: NGTD SPUTUM CULTURE: 1 COLONY OF ASPERGILLUS FUMIGATUS BLOOD CULTLURES: NGTD MYCOLYTIC AND AFB BLOOD CULTURES: NGTD .
Brief Hospital Course: 38-year-old female with ALL s/p double cord blood SCT [**1-/2173**] c/b GVHD, CHF secondary to anthracycline induced cardiomyopathy, embolic CVA on coumadin presented with altered mental status, ascites secondary to congestive hepatopathy, and acute on chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation presumed to be secondary to cardiac GVHD with initial EF <10%.
She was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and zosyn.
In the CCU, she was diuresed with a combination of milrinone for inotropic support and furosemide with adjunctive metalozone.
For presumed GVHD, she was pulsed with solumedrol 1 g followed by taper from 60 mg IV to 15 mg IV BID in addition to continuing mycophenolate.
After transfer out of the CCU, steroids were tapered and she was given a dose of ritxuan as a steroid sparing [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
She was again admitted to the CCU where she was diuresed and was taken for right heart cath which demonstrated pulmonary hypertension responsive to sildenafil.
She was started on Nifedipine and Sildenafil with improvement in EF to 40%.
Torsemide was resumed and titrated to maintain volume status even.
# Pulmonary HTN: Pulmonary HTN was investigated with RHC on [**6-30**].
With addition of milrinone: wedge decreased from 31 to 22, there was no change in cardiac output and PVR increased from 160 to 400.
Sildenafil was started and was uptitrated to 80 mg TID.
Nifedipine was also started at 30 mg per day and uptitrated to 60mg daily.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient baseline creatinine 2.5 - 3.0 with admission Cr 3.8.
FeUrea 38% consistent with pre-renal state.
# Parainfluenza pneumonia: Patient developed new fever and pulmonary infiltrates on [**2174-7-7**], she was started IV vancomycin and cefepime for hospital acquired pneumonia coverage.
A bronchoscopy with BAL sample collected in light of fevers.
Hepatology was consulted and felt that clinical picture represented cholestatic hepatitis, but may be having fulminant hepatic failure if INR not due to coumadin effect.
# Coagulopathy: Supratherapeutic INR to ~16 on admission, reversed with Vit K and 2U FFP.
Coumadin and Fluconazole were held, and INR trended down.
# ALL: s/p double cord blood SCT [**1-/2173**] complicated by GVHD on immunosuppression with recent decrease in prednisone dose to 50mg prior to admission.
Tacrolimus was discontinued given renal failure.
She was treated with methylprednisolone as above.
She was discharged home on CellCept 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] and methylprednisolone 60mg IV once daily.
A left knee xray was performed to rule out AVN, but noted a periosteal reaction with bone mottled, which was concerning for early AVN.
# Hyponatremia: Sodium trended down to mid-120s during diuresis likely from heart failure given decreased effective circulating volume in addition to usage of thiazide.
TSH and cortisol were normal.
Her calcium was increased and was given IV when symptomatic.
Etiology may be low grade hemolysis given insidious trend related to aforementioned thrombotic angiopathy.
# Embolic stroke in [**3-/2174**]: Patient was on coumadin as an outpatient.
Neurologic exam was monitored and non-focal.
In discussion with her primary oncologist and review of the MRI findings at the time of diagnosis, it was determined that embolic stroke was unlikely and Coumadin was discontinued.
Managed with MS contin and Morphine IR.

Host Disease Pulmonary arterial hypertension Parainfluenza pneumonia Congestive hepatopathy   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You underwent cardiac catheterization to diagnose pulmonary hypertension and were started on nifedipine and sildenafil to treat pulmonary hypertension.
You will continue the torsemide at home, receiving it through the PICC.
You also underwent bronchoscopy to collect samples for culture to identify a cause for your fevers.
A sputum culture that was collected grew out a mold called Aspergillus fumigatus so you were started on Voriconazole for treatment.
We made the following changes to your home medication list: START Nifedipine for pulmonary hypertension START Sildenafil for pulmonary hypertension START Voriconazole for treatment of Aspergillus infection START Solumedrol (methyprednisolone) 60mg IV daily START digoxin for heart failure START omeprazole to protect your stomach while on steroids CHANGE torsemide to 40mg IV daily for heart failure STOP carvedilol.
Instead, take metoprolol succinate (Toprol XL) 50mg once a day.
STOP valsartan STOP coumadin STOP pentamidine monthly STOP fluticasone-salmeterol (Advair) inhaler STOP morphine.
Please keep a journal of your numbers and bring them to your appointments.
