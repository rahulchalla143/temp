Red cells show mild anisopoikilocytosis with rare teardrop and fragmented cells.
ASPIRATE SMEARS    The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation, however, it contains only rare hypocellular spicules almost entirely composed of stomal cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes.
CLOT SECTION AND BIOPSY SLIDES  The marrow is markedly hypocellular with eosinophil debris consistent with recent chemotherapy.
In addition, there are several small islands of immature appearing lymphoid cells admixed with plasma cells.
DIAGNOSIS  Bone marrow aspirate and core biopsy:  Hypercellular bone marrow extensively infiltrated by acute leukemia.
While a subpopulation of cells show a definitive myeloid differentiation including Auer rods, a second population is composed of smaller cells with scant cytoplasm and overall lymphoid-appearing features.
Maturing myeloid and erythroid precursors are markedly decreased.
Marrow clot section contains too few spicules for evaluation.
Gross:  The specimen is received in B+ Fixative labeled with "[**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname 16376**]" and "M05-619" and consists of a bone core biopsy measuring up to 1.2 cm, and a single blood clot measuring up to 2.2 cm, entirely submitted into cassette coded A for decalcification.
now on HIDAC therapy w/ O2 requirement, RUQ pain and fever REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for progression of PNA, effusion, gallbladder pathology CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were obtained after the administration of IV and oral contrast.

BRONCHIAL WASHINGS Procedure Date of [**2132-11-25**]   REPORT APPROVED DATE: [**2132-11-27**] SPECIMEN RECEIVED: [**2132-11-26**]    [**-5/4251**]    BRONCHIAL WASHINGS  SPECIMEN DESCRIPTION: Received 5ml cloudy fluid.
There are scattered small mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, including in the periportal and aortocaval locations, measuring approximately 5 mm.
FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT    FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING    The following tests (antibodies) were performed:  HLA-DR, Glycophorin A, Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens:  2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11c, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 33, 34, 41, 56, 64, 71, 117.
The apparent presence of very dim CD19 and the morphology of a subpopulation of cells resembling lymphoblasts, raises the possibility of an 11q23 breakpoint.
Myeloid cells appear increased; erythroid cells appear decreased.
While there, the patient was started on 7+3 consolidation therapy.
He finished a course of 7+3 but still had residual disease on a bone marrow biopsy after completion.
Because of this, he was started on HIDAC therapy that he tolerated well.
Following HIDAC therapy in late Noevember, he had a rebound in his platelets, but his WBC count remained low.
A repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**1-8**] revealed bone marrow cellularity of 10% consisting mostly of an infiltrate of immature mononuclear cells consistent with blasts, present in small clusters, with very limited erythropoeisis and abnormal appearing megakaryocytes.
ID - The patient developed fevers and myalgias several days before admission and was given tamiflu by his PCP he tested positive for influenza (subsequently tested negative here).
He continued to deteriorate and and had an oxygen requirement when transferred here as well as a temperature up to 105 that persisted for days.
He was started sequentially on different antibiotics until ultimately he was on meropenem, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and voriconazole.
He was sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for worsening oxygenation but avoided intubation and was gradually weaned off a NRB.
He developed a transaminitis to voriconazole and was switched to 5mg/kg of ambisome which he tolerated better.
The patient was called out of the unit and gradually improved to the point where his abx were weaned to meropenem and fluconazole was substituted for ambisome.
He was restarted on vancomycin for a coag negative staph bacteremia and his line was initially switched over a guide wire.
He remained febrile until his line was removed and replaced at an alternative site.
He was restarted on ambisome at 3mg/kg at this time and his LFTs again began to slowly trend upwards.
He remained febrile and his ambisome was eventually increased to 5 mg/kg.
He received a holiday from his prophylactic acyclovir and his allopurinol was discontinued as a result of his continued elevated transaminases.
He continued to remain afebrile and his vancomycin and acyclovir were discontinued.
Patient has follow-up appointment on discharge from hospital with dermatological surgery for excisional biopsy of nevus, and will need to make a follow-up skin exam with dermatology in 6 months.
He was started on metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] with good control of his BP, but continued to have some sinus tachycardia.
Heart failure - a TTE was initially ordered prior to his chemotherapy which showed a mildly depressed EF.
