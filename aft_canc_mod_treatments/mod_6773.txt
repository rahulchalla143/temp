She was born to a 34 year-old, G1, P1 now 2 mother by Cesarean section for breech presentation (this twin was breech) and unstoppable preterm labor.
She received a complete course of betamethasone and was treated with ampicillin, erythromycin and magnesium sulfate.
Her magnesium was discontinued on [**2121-3-15**] in the evening when she was beta complete and was restarted a few hours labor for increasing preterm labor.
Her labor was not able to be arrested so she was taken for STAT Cesarean section.
This infant emerged with an initial gas and was resuscitated with bulb suction, drying, stimulation and PPV.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  Respiratory: The infant had respiratory distress syndrome on admission to the NICU and was given 2 doses of Surfactant therapy on the newborn day.
She weaned to CPAP on day of life one after initiation of caffeine citrate at that time.
She transitioned to nasal cannula oxygen on [**2121-5-8**] and then to room air on [**2121-5-10**].
She remained on room air until [**2121-5-17**] at which time, due to oxygen desaturation drift, she was started on nasal cannula oxygen.
Due to spells, she was started on CPAP on [**2121-5-18**] and she received approximately 24 hours of CPAP and then the CPAP was discontinued and she returned to room air on [**2121-5-19**] after packed red blood cells transfusion for anemia.
She remains on caffeine citrate at this time and she does have an occasional yet rare apneic episode on a daily basis.
Cardiovascular:  She was treated with indomethacin on day one of life for an audible murmur and active precordium.
She received only a single course of indomethacin and had follow-up echocardiogram on [**2121-3-19**] which showed no PDA but a PFO was present at that time.
The caffeine citrate was held for approximately 3 days as it was felt to be the cause of the tachycardia and the tachycardia resolved.
She is presently stable on her caffeine citrate with heart rates in the 130's to 160's.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  UAC and UVC were placed on admission to the NICU.
Parenteral nutrition was started on newborn day.
The UAC was discontinued on [**2121-3-18**], day of life 2.
Central PICC was placed on [**2121-3-21**] and the UVC was discontinued at that time.
Enteral feedings were initiated on [**2121-3-20**] with a slow advance.
She achieved full enteral feedings on [**2121-3-27**] which is day of life 11.
She is on vitamin E and elemental iron.
Gastrointestinal: The infant developed hyperbilirubinemia and was treated with phototherapy for approximately 8 days with a peak bilirubin level of 5.0 over 0.3.
She remains on iron supplementation with ferrous sulfate at 0.3 ml per day which is 2 mg/kg per dose.
She had remained stable with anemia of prematurity up until [**2121-5-18**] at which time, due to worsening respiratory status, going from room air to nasal cannula to CPAP and having spells, she was treated with packed red blood cells at that time and since then has resolved her respiratory status and is presently on room air after the transfusion.
The infant was started on ampicillin and gentamycin which was subsequently discontinued when the CBC and blood culture remained negative at that time and her clinical status stabilized.
No antibiotics were started and the blood culture subsequently remained negative at 48 hours.
The infant was started on Vancomycin and gentamycin for a planned 48 hour rule out sepsis.
She is clinically improved since having packed RBC transfusion and will likely have her antibiotics discontinued on [**2121-5-20**].
Medications:  Caffeine citrate 18 mg po/pg daily which is 7 mg/kg per dose.
Ferrous sulfate 0.3 ml po/pg daily which is 2 mg/kg per dose.
Vitamin E 5 units po/pg daily.
Iron and vitamin D supplementation:  Iron supplementation is recommended for preterm and low birth weight infants until 12 months corrected age.
All infants fed predominantly breast milk should receive Vitamin D supplementation at 200 i.u.
Immunizations received: Infant received hepatitis B vaccine on [**2121-4-16**], PediaRix on [**2121-5-16**], HIB on [**2121-5-16**] and Pneumococcal vaccine on [**2121-5-16**].
Immunizations recommended: Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the following four criteria:  (1) Born at less than 32 weeks; (2) Born between 32 weeks and 35 weeks with two of the following:  Day care during RSV season, a smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or school age siblings; (3) chronic lung disease or (4) hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.
Influenza immunization is recommended annually in the Fall for all infants once they reach 6 months of age.
Before this age, and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
This infant has not received ROTA virus vaccine.
