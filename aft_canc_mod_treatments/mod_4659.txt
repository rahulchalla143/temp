Right adrenal mass, excision (A-F): Malignant neoplasm most consistent with adrenal cortical carcinoma, see note.
Liver segment six, resection (G-O): Malignant neoplasm most consistent with adrenal cortical carcinoma, see note.
Postop she was in the SICU for fluid management and ATN.
Stress dose steroids were given preop and postop per Endocrinology.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] tapered prednisone after one week as she developed an incision infection necessitating opening the incision and using a wound vac.
These trended down postop with the exception of the alk phos which increased to as high as 806 on HD 20.
She required PICC line placement for IV antibiotics and TPN as her kcals were insufficient.
She developed a Klebsiella uti which was treated with Cipro and Flagyl for the wound x 4 days.
These antibiotics were switched to Vanco and Meropenum when a wound culture identified strep veridans, sparse yeast, Klebsiella which was pan sensitive and staph coag positive resistent to levo/oxicillin/penicillin and sensitive to vanco.
She developed a 2nd UTI,yeast which was treated with a GU Ampho bladder irrigant x3 days.
She was started on coumadin and IV heparin until she was therapeutic.

She then underwent successful drainage catheter placement in collection in the subhepatic and hepatic areas on [**2194-11-12**].
The plan is for her to go to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on TPN via a R picc with a RUQ incision wound vac.
She has 2 hepatic drains to gravity drainage and meropenum/vanco will continue until next week.
