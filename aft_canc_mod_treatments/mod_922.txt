Prominent ascending aorta with dense calcification.
CXR: [**2149-5-30**]: INDICATION FOR STUDY: Right hilar mass with hemoptysis, status post bronchoscopy, evaluate for any interval change.
The retrocardiac space is obscured and consolidation cannot be excluded in this region.
[**2149-6-1**]: CXR: IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to chest films since [**5-27**], most recently [**6-1**] at 11:08 a.m.
Bronchial mucosa with distorted atypical cells suspicious for large cell carcinoma, see level 1 recut.
Note:  Immunoperoxidase studies for cytokeratin are not contributory .
The second more inferior artery does not appear to connect to the aorta on this arteriogram and also was not visualized on the flush aortograms.
Right bronchial arteriography through the microcatheter was performed at two stations to confirm on going patency and inflow of blood into the bronchial artery, which was present.
IVC filter is seen, and extensive vascular calcifications are seen within the great vessels as well as coronary arteries.
The patient is status post median sternotomy with a dual lead left-sided pacer.
The patient is status post left-sided total hip replacement which slightly degrades the images.
Bilateral pleural effusions with septal lines and ground-glass opacities consistent with fluid overload.
A PPD was checked and warfarin was discontinued.
He was given 3 more units of FFP and 1U PRBC and he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for monitoring, and to await rigid bronchoscopy by Interventional Pulmonology.
He had a transbronchial needle aspirate, endobronchial biopsy tumor excision with forceps, and tumor destruction with APC (Argon Plasma Coagulation) was done at that time.
HD #[**8-27**]: In the interim, he has been oxygenating well on the floor (92-98% on 2-3L), his hct has been stable to the order of 28-29.
At this point, Rad Onc was consulted and did not feel that he is a candidate for emergent radiation at this time and would prefer staging workup by thoracic oncology before defining a plan; i.e.
They indicated that he could not be replaced on anticoagulation until undergoing XRT to the lung field.
At the beginning of the bronchoscopy, his SBP dropped to 60 in the setting of being started on propfol and remifentanyl and then his BPs responded to neo which was weaned off neo easily.
He underwent the transbronchial needle aspiration and biopsy and argon plasma coagulation procedure;  during the procedure, he was noted to have massive hemoptysis.
Subsequently, he was intubated for airway protection.
HD #11: Reextubated in MICU.
Heme-Onc, Thoracics were also consulted regarding a cohesive management plan.
HD #15: Underwent embolization of R bronchial artery supplying superior segment of RLL.
HD #17: Underwent staging CT Head, Chest, Abdomen/Pelvis and PET-CT. See Results section for CT scan findings.
The secondary benefit of receiving XRT is that once the course is completed, that will be the point where the patient can restart his anticoagulation for his chronic PEs/DVTs.
Prior to discharge to rehab, the patient received 2 cycles of XRT with more cycles to be planned after the weekend.
Coumadin held due to bleeding risk.
- with finding of lung mass, will not be able to replace on coumadin until patient receives XRT.
He received a 7 day course of Ceftriaxone in house.
# COPD: - Continued on Advair, spiriva and PRN albuterol - minimize supplemental oxygen; he is comfortable on room air .
Ischemia: - Continue atorvastatin, ASA .
Pump: - continue carvedilol - Daily weights, I/Os, 1.5L fluid restriction - lasix was held during this admission.
He was intermittently given lasix as needed for mild overload.
# FEN: low sodium/ cardiac diet with fluid restriction < 1200cc/day.
# L heel ulcer: - daily dressing changes - multipodus splints and vitamin C/Zinc .
coumadin held.
