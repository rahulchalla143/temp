He was admitted to the BMT service for induction chemotherapy with [**Company 2860**] #06-254 protocol.
Prior to the bone marrow biopsy, a broad differential diagnosis was considered including bone marrow suppression secondary to viral infection vs. malignancy (given the 90% lymphocytes).
Patient's anemia and pancytopenia were profound, and while in the ICU, he received pRBC to maintain a HCT > 21 and platelets to maintain platelets >50 given recent retinal hemorrhages.
He was transferred to the BMT service, where he was enrolled in the adult ALL consortium trial (protocol #06-254) and started on induction chemotherapy.
His induction regimen included Vincristine on days 1,8,15, and 22; Doxorubicin on days 1, and 2; MTX on day 3; e. coli Asparaginase on day 4; IT cytarabine on day 1; IT cytarabine, MTX and hydrocortisone on day 15; and prednisone daily.
Patient was anticoagulated with Lovenox given risk of clotting with asparaginase.
Patient had no pain and visual changes resolved without further intervention.
Neutropenic Fever: Patient developed a fever and was initially started on cefepime and clindamycin (clindamycin for oral anaerobe coverage given mouth sores and possible dental cavity).
A blood culture from his PICC line (one bottle) grew GNR's at 83 hours.
Given capnocytophaga's sensitivities (and desire to decrease risk for c. dif), cefepime and clindamycin were discontinued and Zosyn was started.
He received mouth care, acyclovir, fluconazole, and ultimately required a dilaudid PCA for pain control.
He received salt tabs and furosemide and sodium improved.
Patient received bowel regimen.
