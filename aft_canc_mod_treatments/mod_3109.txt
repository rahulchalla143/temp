While in the Waiting Room the patient had an acute onset of respiratory distress requiring intubation and was admitted to the [**Hospital 882**] Hospital Intensive Care Unit.
MEDICATIONS:  Medications as an outpatient, none.
Medications on transfer were Heparin subcutaneously, Morphine and Ativan prn.
Arterial blood gases, pressor support ventilation of 10 and 5 is 7.54, 27, and greater than 250.
Large left-sided neck mass, nontender, approximately 8 by 8 cm.
RADIOGRAPHS:  Chest x-ray from outside hospital, large left neck mass with questionable mediastinal lymphadenopathy, endotracheal tube at carina.
Chest computerized tomography scan without contrast, large neck mass, 7 by 7 in diameter, left trachea shifted to right, trachea compressed around endotracheal tube.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 69 year old female with left-sided neck mass consistent with squamous cell carcinoma, most likely of esophageal origin, causing airway compromise, intubated for airway protection.
It was felt given the size of the mass that extubation could not be done safely without further securing the airway.
In light of these findings, the patient was scheduled for Operating Room placement of a tracheostomy.
The patient's trachea was dissected to the fifth tracheal ring and an endotracheal tube was placed instead of a stable tracheostomy tube, given the difficulty of the procedure.
On hospital day #10, the patient had an open gastrostomy tube placed and a Port-A-Cath placed by General Surgery.
A panendoscopy was done at the time of her tracheostomy placement on hospital day #10 which showed diffuse tumor in both the trachea and the esophagus.
On the day after gastrostomy tube and Port-A-Cath placement, extensive discussions were taken with the family.
Interventional Pulmonology was consulted for possible stenting of the esophageal tracheal fistula, however, given the location it was felt that no stent could be placed in either the esophagus or the trachea at this time.
Given the poor prognosis with the extent of disease, complicated by the tracheoesophageal fistula, the decision on whether to pursue radiation and chemotherapy was in question.
The patient decided that she wanted to not pursue chemotherapy and radiation therapy and would want to go home with home hospice care.
The patient was also made Do-Not-Resuscitate at this time.
Given the unusual nature of the patient's tracheostomy tube, a customized tracheostomy was ordered and is currently enroute to the hospital.
The patient is to have a more permanent airway placed on Wednesday, [**11-8**].
During this hospitalization palliative care was consulted to aid in placement and home services.
The patient completed a ten-day course of Levaquin and Clindamycin which was later added after the tracheal esophageal fistula was found.
We will try to observe the patient off of antibiotics but anticipate that she may continue to have lowgrade fevers due to her tracheoesophageal fistula and extent of tumor burden.
The patient was treated with Levaquin, and subsequent cultures have remained negative.
The Foley catheter was discontinued on hospital day #19.
Thrush - It was noted that the patient has several plaques on her tongue and was started on Nystatin Swish and Swallow which will have to continue while at home.
Tubes, lines and drains - The patient has had her Foley catheter discontinued.
She has a Port-A-Cath which has been deaccessed and has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
She is currently receiving tube feeds 24 hours a day at 60 cc/hr.
Airway compromise, status post tracheostomy 3.
