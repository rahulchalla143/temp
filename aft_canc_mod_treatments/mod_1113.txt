Admission Date:  [**2137-12-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-12-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2113-9-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: Cough and Dyspnea on Exertion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization, Pericardiocentesis, Pleurocentesis and Hickman Line Placement.
Had successful pericardiocentesis (removal of 600cc of straw colored fluid) and drain placement.
It consists predominantly of variably-sized blasts with scant cytoplasm, irregular convoluted nuclei with fine chromatin and multiple nucleoli.
Resting hemodynamics deomonstrated elevated right and left sided pressures with blunted Y descent and elevation of pericardial pressures with equalization of RA and pericardial pressures (18 mmHg) consistent with tamponade.
The cardiac index improved from 1.9 l/min/m2 to 3.1 l/min/m2 with removal of pericardial fluid.
Pericardiocentesis was performed in one pass with withdrawl of approximately 600 cc of straw colored fluid.
There is a small pericardial effusion with fibrin deposits on the surface of the heart.

The patient underwent the Hyper-CVAD chemotherapeutic regimen.
Soon after Hyper-CVAD initiation, his cells lines fell.
He was maintained on Levofloxacin, Fluconazole, Acyclovir and Allopurinol for prophylaxis and had no fevers throughout his course.
He was discharged with oncologic follow-up and a future allogenic bone marrow transplant was planned.
He underwent successful pericardiocentesis and drain placement, which was later removed.
Fluconazole 200 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
Levofloxacin 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
Acyclovir 400 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO three times a day.
2) Please avoid contact with anyone with a cold, diarrhea, or any other possible infection.
