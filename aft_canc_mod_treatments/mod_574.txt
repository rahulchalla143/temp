During that admission EGD performed: gastric mass w/ non diagnostic Bx, gastric ulcer, gastritis/duodenitis, while pt taking heparin/integrelin for AVR.
Past Medical History: Cardiac: CVA x 1 Afib s/p cardioversion (last doc episode [**2181**]) AS s/p mechanical AVR ([**Hospital3 **] AV [**2181**]) CAD s/p CABG x 6 (SVGx4, RIMA, LIMA) w/ SVG to RCA stent([**11-3**]) CHF (EF=30%) w/diffuse hypokinesis PVD s/p b/l metatarsal amputation Hyperlipidemia HTN NQWMI .

Endoscopic resection not possible given fungating mass w/ LAD spread; Surgery not actively pursued given increased operative mortality given cardiac risk factors.
Trend Hct TID reveals hemodynamically stable and no clinical signs of bleeding x 3 days while pt had 2 large bore IVs, protonix 40mg [**Hospital1 **], and DC coumadin/heparin per cardiology to minimize potential risk of GI bleeding.
Pt exhibited mildly increased daily weight so lasix was temporarily held for risk of hypotension.
Furthermore, given the predicament of AVR anticoagulation vs. bleeding GI mass, cardiology was consulted who recommended DC coumadin/heparin but maintain on plavix for total 4 weeks given the lower mortality for stroke vs. bleed.
Please continue Plavix for two more weeks, lipitor, lisinopril, metoprolol, daily weights.
PLAVIX FOR TWO MORE WEEKS ONLY (TOTAL OF 4 WEEKS).
