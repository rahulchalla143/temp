Admission Date:  [**2102-4-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-4-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2038-12-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4393**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension following anesthesia induction  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization   History of Present Illness: 63 year old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis and HCC, osteoporosis, ovarian cysts, active smoker for 40 years, who presented to OR for elective RFA as outpatient today and was found to be hypotensive and bradycardic after administration of sedatives for intubation.
She underwent induction for anesthesia with propofol, succ, rocuronium, fentanyl with blood pressure dropping from the systolic 90s to 60s.
She received glycopyrolate with HRs recovering to 100s; she then received esmolol to decrease HR.
RFA was postponed given her hypotension and bradycardia.
She received a total of 2.5L LR and neosynephrine approximately every 1/2hour for 3 doses.
She also received 1gm iv cefazolin.
Took one of her alprazolam 0.25mg last night.
PROCEDURE:  The procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with the patient and written informed consent was obtained during a preprocedure interventional radiology consultation.
The patient underwent induction of general anesthesia for the procedure.
After prepping the patient, and prior to beginning the procedure, the anesthesiologist noted ST depression on the monitor and the procedure was put on hold.
The procedure was terminated, and general anesthesia was reversed.
Please see details dictated under CT interventional procedure #[**Numeric Identifier 110214**].
Medical therapy for coronary artery disease with aspirin, betablocker, statin, smoking cessasion, risk factor reduction.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 year old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis and HCC, osteoporosis, ovarian cysts, active smoker for 40 years, who presented to OR for elective RFA as outpatient today and was found to be hypotensive and bradycardic after administration of sedatives for intubation.
Her EKG was concerning for ST depressions in the setting of hypotension, with a troponin elevation, so patient underwent cardiac catheterization with no angiographical flow limiting disease.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Hypotension: Pt was found to be hypotensive as low as systolic 60s, likely secondary to medications for induction.
Per PACU notes, she received propofol, succ, rocuronium, fentanyl; she was subsequently treated with IVFs, glycopyrrolate, and neosynephrine with BP subsequently rising to 80s-90s.
Volume depletion was  likely another contributing factor as pt had been NPO since night prior to procedure and was fluid responsive in PACU.
She received additional fluid boluses in the ICU, but still required dopamine temporarily overnight following her procedure.
She also received esmolol after she became tachycardic from glycopyrrolate.
# Osteoporosis: continued home raloxifene, calcium and vitamin D .
# Tobacco abuse: Pt was supplied a nicotine patch while in hospital .
# Pt's initial chest xray was concerning for pneumonia, however pt was clinically well and asymptomatic.
No antibiotics were started but would have low threshold to initiate treatment for pneumonia if pt develops symptoms.
