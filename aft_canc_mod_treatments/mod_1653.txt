[**2124-8-31**] PICC Placement [**2124-9-1**] - PICC line exchange for a new 5-French double lumen PICC line.
History of Present Illness: This is a 58 year old male with CML s/p allo stem cell transplant [**9-/2121**] c/b chronic GVHD of liver/lung/gut, O2 dependent bronchiolitis obliterans and bronchiectasis, presenting with hypoxia.
The next am, he took off his baseline oxygen to go to the bathroom and had 5 episodes of diarrhea, which he had been having at the rehab facility as well.
His SBP remained 80s-90s (baseline reportedly 100), so a CVC was placed and norepinephrine was started.
In terms of chronic GVHD, he has had chronic abdominal discomfort since transplant that is thought to be associated with GVHD.
In [**11/2122**], his GVHD progressed with skin rash and liver function abnormalities.
He was on photophoresis for approximately one year for GVHD management.
He has been on chronic pain medication for the back pain, as well as the abdominal discomfort.
He was on anticoagulation for a PE diagnosed in [**3-/2123**] and this was stopped in [**9-/2123**] as he had received 6 months of anticoagulation and was also at risk for falls.

After a period of observation in the ER, it appeared that he was tiring and he was intubated for increased work of breathing.
His chest x-ray appeared clear, CT scan the next day showed a new LLL opacity, and he was treated empirically with Zosyn and linezolid.
He continued IV Zosyn and PO linezolid.
He was also started on prophylactic Azithromycin (see below) for its antimicrobial and antiinflammatory effects in bronchiolitis obliterans patients.
He was intially on levophed but with IV fluid boluses he was able to weaned off levophed.
After his blood pressure normalized, and with antibiotic treatment his lactate also normalized.
He is chronically on steroids, so while intubated he received stress dose steroids.
Mr. [**Known lastname 976**] was also put on a 40 mg taper of oral prednisone while on the BMT service.
His respiratory status began to decline with taper when prednisone was 10mg daily so it was increased to 15mg [**Hospital1 **] and tapered to 10mg [**Hospital1 **].
He was continued on his bactrim, voriconazole, and acyclovir for prophylaxis.
# LLL Pneumonia/Respiratory status: Pt was treated with Zosyn and linezolid as above.
On [**2124-9-11**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] respiratory status began to decline with his steroid taper.
His zosyn and azithromycin were stopped and he was given a 7 day course of cefepime and cipro (ended [**2124-9-18**]).
His Linezolid was stopped on [**2124-9-14**] (completed 17 day course).
Pulmonology recommended continuing tobramycin 4 weeks on/4 weeks off (prior course ended [**2124-8-28**], RESTART [**2124-9-28**]).
He was started on azithromycin 500mg x6 days ([**Date range (1) 30714**]), 250mg x6 days ([**Date range (1) 30715**]), then 250mg every other day (start [**2124-9-29**]).
ID recommended monthly IVIG and he received 35g IVIG on [**2124-9-17**], premedicated with tylenol and diphenhydramine.
He still tended to desaturate to mid 80%s with ambulation and required oxygen 2-3L/min at all times.
# Hx of PE, DVT: Has hx of multiple PEs in [**2122**] and DVT in early [**2123**], is on chronic anticoagulation, was continued on his home dose of lovenox 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
# Multiple Vertebral Fractures: patient on narcotics at home, methadone initially held while intubated and on a fentanyl drip, on extubation his home pain regimen was restarted.
He did well on his home pain regimen.
# GERD: patient maintained on a PPI, due to history of GERD and chronic steroid use.
