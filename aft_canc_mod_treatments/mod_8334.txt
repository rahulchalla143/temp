She was given hydralazine IV with improvement in her SBP from 2227 to 125.
She was subsequently intubated for airway protection.
The patient had received 3.5mg versed and 100mg fentanyl over 45 minutes.
She was briefly placed on neo with resultant SBPs in the 220s and then controlled on a labetolol gtt; once BPs were well controlled she was transitioned to po meds (norvasc, isordil).
She was also noted to have a UTI (GNR) and was started on ciprofloxacin.
Cervical myelopathy; status post anterior disc excisions and fusions at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6.
Status post right total hip replacement in [**2171**].
History of drop attacks; previously on Dilantin but this was stopped and she has had no further symptoms.
Obstructive sleep apnea; on continuous positive airway pressure at home.

Bronch [**1-21**] COMPLICATIONS:  Muscle rigidity secondary to Fentanyl resulting in hypoxemia, airway obstruction and respiratory failure.
Bronch [**1-22**] DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The bronchoscope was inserted via the endotracheal tube which terminated 2 cm proximal to the carina.
Tissue Biopsies of LUL pending on discharge  Brief Hospital Course: 80 year old woman with complicated PMH including broncheoalveolar carcinoma for which she was undergoing an elective bronchoscopy when she had an episode of rigidity, hypertension and desaturation attributed to a dystonic reaction to fentanyl and was subsequently intubated and in the MICU.
s/p extubation she was transferred to the floor for observation prior to discharge back to [**Hospital3 **].
She was intubated for airway protection and extubated without diffuculty.
Broncheoalveolar Cancer The patient successfully underwent bronchoscopy the day after her dystonic reaction and biopsy specimens were obtained of her LUL mass.
Right neck mass After right sided central line placement, complicated by puncture of the subclavian artery, the patient was noted to have a right sided neck mass.
Labile BP The patient has a history of hypertension and was on isordil and norvasc as an outpatient.
During her dystonic reaction her systolic pressure went as high as 225, she was given 10mg IV diltiazem with good effect and systolic pressure returning down to 125.
Subsequently her ICU course was complicated by lability in blood pressures, with systolics falling to the 80s with administration of propofol.
For this the patient was briefly on a neo gtt and pressures again went >200 for which she was on a labetolol gtt.
Prior to leaving the MICU her pressures were stabilized on her home medications and remained well controlled through the remainder of her stay.
She was started on a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin for a complicated UTI, which grew out klebsiella that was pan sensitive (I to nitrofurantoin).
OSA The patient will resume her CPAP at night on discharge (she declined it here).
Right subclavian central line dc'd on [**2184-1-24**].
