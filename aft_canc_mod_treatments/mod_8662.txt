Unchanged stenosis at the arterial anastomosis which was not instrumented during current procedure and does not appear significantly changed from prior examination.
POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE PREPARATION (Final [**2109-5-10**]):       TEST CANCELLED, PATIENT CREDITED.
Arthrocentesis revealed 15 cc of cloudy, viscous fluid with 129,000 WBC, >90% polys.
She received vancomycin for a presumed septic joint and was taken to the operating room for arthrotomy and drain placement.
She was started on ceftriaxone on [**5-10**] for potential gonococcal infection.
ID was consulted, and recommended continuing vancomycin for a 6 week course.
Ceftriaxone was stopped on [**5-15**].
Extensive discussion was given regarding repeat thoracentesis prior to discharge, but patient had good range of motion at the joint and felt pain had improved since admission, and it was uncelar what diagnostic benefit would be gained from a second thoracentesis.
Vancomycin was initially continued given it was the optimal [**Doctor Last Name 360**] and patient had other possible agents (such as famotidine) that may have contributed to thrombocytopenia.
Hematology was consulted and felt thrombocytopenia was more likely related to marrow suppression than vancomycin toxicity, and vanco was continued.
The decision was made to continue vancomycin and to monitor her paltelets as an outpatient.
- Would consider further thoracentesis if patient experiences increasing pain and swelling, or difficulty with range of motion.
Medical record was very carefully examined and patient had no known exposure to heparin during this hospitalization.
- Continue vancomycin for 6 weeks as long as platelet count stable.
She was was exposed to vancomycin, morphine, and anesthetic agents during the arthrotomy.
She was given diphenhydramine 12.5 IV q8hrs, famotidine 40 mg PO bid, and she received methylprednisolone once, though this was not continued given her history of DM1 and likely septic joint.
Facial swelling resolved with dialysis and may have been due to volume overload rather than angioedema.
Cinacalcet was also administered for calcium control.
Cinacalcet was discontinued prior to discharge due to hypocalcemia.
Tunnelled dialysis catheter removed in house.
Oncology recommended outpatient mammogram/USD for further evaluation.
Swelling improved with dilation of brachiocephalic - SVC stenosis by IR, and exam was otherwise unremarkable.
She was continued on insulin NPH 10 [**Hospital1 **] and a humalog sliding scale.
The ACE inhibitor was held until after hemodialysis on those days to decrease the risk of hypotension during these sessions.
## CAD: Patient not takin aspirin (due to bleeding), metoprolol or statin as an outpatient.
Continued on ACE inhibitor as above.
## Gout: She was continued on allopurinol 150 every other day.
## Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine 25 .
## FEN/Lytes: NPO for now, cardiac, renal diet in a.m., replete lytes prn .
## Prophylaxis: No heparin given allergy, pneumoboots .

You will need to take antibiotics for a full 4 week course to treat this infection.
This reaction was likely related to the anesthetic agents used in the Operating Room, and did not appear to be related to your BP medications which were restarted prior to discharge without any difficulty.
Followup Instructions: Please have your platelet counts checked with hemodialysis within the next 3 days.
