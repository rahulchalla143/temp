A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present.
A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present.
Impression: the markedly elevated antegrade pressure gradients across prostheses in the tricuspid and aortic positions suggest a mechanical abnormality such as immobilized leaflet (pannus ingrowth vs valve thrombosis); consider transesophageal echocardiography to better define  ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY) Study Date of [**2158-8-3**] 8:28 AM IMPRESSION: 1.
Following her EGD her octreotide gtt was discontinued and her PPI was switched to [**Hospital1 **].
She was also started on Levo/Flagyl (PCN allergy) for SBP ppx.
Coagulopathy, s/p Mechanical Valves x3: Patient with aortic, mitral, tricuspid valves due to endocarditis, INR goal between 2.5-3.5 with current INR goal closer to 2.5 given GIB weighed against risk of thrombus given her three mechanical valves.
She was bridged using IV Heparin once her coumadin was held, and her INR went subtherapeutic.
It was a long time to re-coumadinize her as we eventually found out that her supplement (Ensure) had a large amount of vitamin K.  #.
Her Coumadin was supratherapeutic so it was held.
She initially had her Metoprolol held given her GI bleed, which were eventually restarted.
COPD: No evidence of an acute exacerbation, Atrovent and Albuterol nebs were continued  #.

They did not do anything at that time because your blood was thin from your coumadin and they did not want you to bleed from the procedure.
The gastroenterologists would like to still perform a procedure on the vessel in your stomach that caused the bleeding.
We spoke with your cardiologist who reported that these were stable from before and did not require anything to be done at this time.
However it dropped too low and this required you to be put on a continuous Heparin IV drip to keep you anticoagulated while we waited for your INR to increase to 2.5.
