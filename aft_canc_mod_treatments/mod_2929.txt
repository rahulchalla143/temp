[**7-18**]:Repeat venogram and additional clot lysis by TPA.
[**7-20**]:Final venogram and placement of SVC stent.
The patient is status post autologous bone marrow transplant on [**2195-9-28**] for treatment of his disease (done at [**Hospital1 336**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**].
Due to concerns of SVC thrombosis and pt s/p transplant w/ Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**], he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
At [**Hospital1 18**], pt taken to IR where he had a mechanical thrombectomy, clot lysis w/ TPA, and stenting of vessels.
Past Medical History: MM diagnosed [**4-1**] s/p autologous BMT [**9-2**] multiple fracture of r. humerus with hardware (hinge).

The patient has received 10 mg of TPA directly into the thrombus at the time of the procedure and is now receiving 1 mg per hour of TPA via infusion catheter into the thrombosis.
The patient is also on a Heparin drip at 200 units per hour peripherally which will be continued.
3) Status post removal of the patient's left portocath.
---  Brief Hospital Course: A/P 61 yo male with multiple myeloma w/ fractures of humerus and vertebrae status post BMT admitted for SVC thrombosis at portacath s/p thrombectomy and clot lysis w/ TPN.
He was initially taken for direct clot lysis with tissue plasminogen activator by IR.
He was sent back to the ICU with a tPA infusion and heparin.
However, while receiving tPA, he began bleeding from the port removal site which was eventually controlled with a pressure dressing.
Finally, several days later, he was again taken for a venogram and had a stent place in his SVC.
He had a narrowed section that was felt to have contributed to his formation of clot.
The stent was placed effectively.
He was then sent out on heparin and continued on this.
He was switched to Lovenox and his heparin gtt was stopped.
He was then started on coumadin and brought to therapeutic levels, at which point the Lovenox was stopped.
Multiple Myeloma: Patient presented with complaints of back pain, fatigue, and weight loss over the 2 weeks prior to admission.
FUO: On the day before his SVC stent was placed Mr [**Known lastname 39602**] had a fever to 101.
At this point, he was started on vancomycin, and defervessed for approx 72 hours.
It was continued nonetheless to protect his stent and arm hardware from contamination.
He did have one episode of itchy rash that resolved with Benadryl and a 5% incidence of eos of his diff.
His portacath removal site was considered as a source and eventual I&D revealed no evidence of infection.
During this process, ID was consulted, and Levaquin and Ceftazidime were both added for broader coverage of possible pathogens.
Patient was treated with metronidazole.
Therefore, given the absence of any obvious symptoms or signs of infection or morbidity as a result of the etiology of the fever, all antibiotics were stopped (except for metronidazole), and patient continued to do well with only acetaminophen for treatment of fever.
Despite these results, patient continued to require infrequent blood transfusions for support.
Given the lack of evidence for hemolysis or loss of red blood cells, the low blood count was concerning as further evidence of myeloma relapse with marrow infiltration.
Renal failure: Following initial procedures performed by Interventional Radiology, patient's serum creatinine began to trend upwards.
Despite aggressive hydration, serum creatinine continued to increase.
