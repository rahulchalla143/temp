EEG was done to rule out non-convulsive status given her encephalopathy but only confirmed moderate/severe diffuse encephalopathy without evidence of focality or epilieptic activity.
Per head imaging, she has evidence of old infarcts on L hemisphere as well possible explaining minimal movements on R side as recrudescence due to multiple medical issues including severe/stage IV sacral decibitus ulcer which required bedside cauterization x2 for bleeding.
She required 3 units of PRBC transfusion while in ED for anemia with hct as low as 10.9 at nadir.
Although still encephalopathic, she remained hemodynamically and neurologically stable hence was transferred out to neurology floor with telemetry on HD #9.
Transferred to floor on HD #10.
Floor Course: #Pneumonia: Patient with hospital acquired pneumonia vs ventilator associated PNA vs. aspiration PNA in setting of CVA, placement of NG tube, and intubation for three days (CXR from [**9-1**] showed increasing RLL opacity) Sputum GS grew Methicillin sensitive staph aureus and pan-sensitive proteus (received 3 days of Zosyn which was switched to ceftriaxone on [**9-5**].)
She was treated with ipratroprium and albuterol nebs, guafenesin as mucolytic, chest PT, and kept on aspiration precautions.
She initially required a shovel mask for oxygenation, and was eventually weaned off of oxygen.
Pt received meds and TFs through NGT.
Eventually had a PEG placed by interventional radiology with no complications.
Pt tolerated TFs and meds through PEG on day of discharge.
PEG should be used as bridge for feeding and medications while patient gets speech and swallow therapy at rehabilitation.
She was continued on a baby aspirin, metoprolol, and a statin.
#Anemia: Pt had coffee ground emesis on first day of admission, which resolved.
Transfused 2 U PRBCs on [**9-4**] with increase in Hct to 30.
GI was consulted who recommended a short course of misoprostol while in house and EGD if patient continued to have evidence of continued GI bleed.
She was continued on IV Protonix and switched to Lansoprazole for her NGT/PEG.
Unlikely cardiogenic or obstructive (TTE neg for tamponade, EF 55%), or autonomic dysfunction related to stroke.
Her hypotension resolved with fluid boluses and her beta blocker was initially held.
She was treated with antibiotics for HAP (see above) and treated for her urosepsis w/ Ciprofloxacin.
resolved with fluids and antibiotics.
Pt was continued on telemetry and a beta blocker.
replaced foley, treated with 3 days of Zosyn and 7 days of PO ciprofloxacin.
She will need 2.5 days of ciprofloxacin (5 doses total) at rehabilitation (end date [**2142-9-14**]).
continued wound care w/ dressing changes [**Hospital1 **].
#Guiac positive stools: Pt has intermittently guiac positive stools in setting of heparin sq.
#FEN: -TFs with vit A, C, ZnSO4 (x10 days) supplementation for wound healing.
-repleted electrolytes aggressively to prevent refeeding syndrome -free H20 boluses (250 q12H).
PEG eventually placed by IR for tube feeds ad NGT removed.
