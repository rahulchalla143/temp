He was anticoagulated for 4 weeks and cardioverted at [**Hospital1 18**] yesterday for A fib with RVR and started newly on amiodarone.
This morning he was feeling weak and took Lasix 120mg and was walking up the stairs on his way to use the bathroom when he had a near syncopal event.
He was externally paced in the field and he received a total of 1 amp of atropine for a bradycardia in the 30s and his SBP was in the 70s.
He was started on a dopamine drip at 6mg.
He desated to 90% on 4L and he needed to be started on a non rebreather with sats at 98%.
He was given Lasix 20mg IV x1.
Pt refuses foley catheter and demands to stand to urinate.

There is again noted prominence of the interstitial markings consistent with pulmonary edema.
# Syncope/bradycardia: Pt had junctional bradycardia with underlying sinus node dysfunction leading to hemodynamic instability initially requiring dopamine gtt.
Of note he was on amiodarone, digoxin, and carvedilol, the levels of which may have been increased in the setting of ARF.
He meets criteria for pacemaker/ICD placement but patient emphatically refused despite being told that he could have recurrence of his syncope without intervention.
He was discontinued on digoxin and amiodarone.
Prior to admission his home dose of lasix was 80qAm and 40qPM although the morning prior to admission to the OSH he took Lasix 120mg and received 20mg IV at the OSH.
On presentation to the CCU he desaturated and required a non rebreather mask in order to maintain an oxygen saturation of 94%.
He was continued on low dose coreg but his lasix and ACE I were held given his acute renal failure.
He was discharged on lasix 120mg daily.
He was originally on a heparin drip in case the decision was made to put in a pacer.
The patient adamantly refused a foley despite our recommendation.
His ACE, lasix, and digoxin were held given his acute renal failure.
He was discharged on lasix 120mg daily.
# CAD: He was continued on ASA, statin, and a low-dose beta blocker.
His ACE inhibitor was held given his acute renal failure.

He was discharged on lasix 120mg daily.
His quinapril was held in the setting of his acute renal failure and was not restarted prior to discharge.
# FEN:  He was on a cardiac/low salt diet and his lytes were maintained K>4 and Mg>2.
