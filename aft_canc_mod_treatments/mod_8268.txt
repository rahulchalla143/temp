Admission Date:  [**2153-7-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-8-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2076-5-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cipro / Codeine / Shellfish  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: abdominal pain   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation; blood product transfusions  History of Present Illness: 77F with history of Crohn's disease, multiple myeloma, anemia requiring multiple prior tranfusions, who initially presented to OSH with fevers and suddent onset of bilateral lower abdominal pain x1 day.
Repeat CT abd/pelvis here (on prelim read) showed [**Last Name (un) **] non-hemorrhagic free fluid in abdomen and pelvis w/ periportal edema, abnormal appearance of the ileocecal junction and proximal colon, significant wall thickening and inflammation suggestive of colitis, distal terminal ileum with minimal wall thickening, and a fluid-filled dilated appendix (14 mm) with surrounding inflammation (most likely reactive inflammation from primary process involving proximal colon).
She received a total of 4L IVF, and is currently receiving albumin 12.5 mg per Surgery recs.
Received additional antibiotics with vancomycin 1 gram.
Received fentantyl, dilaudid, and acetaminophen for pain control.
Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with GI and Surgery to follow.
She developed nausea and vomitting while on these medications and self d/c'd the cipro.
Past Medical History: Crohn's disease COPD Multiple myeloma Chronic anemia requiring periodic transfusions Chronic pancytopenia  Past Surgical History: s/p ex-lap for Crohn's disease no bowel resection s/p cholecystectomy [**10**]'s s/p D&Cs   Social History: Lives at elderly nursing complex.
Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):       [**Female First Name (un) **] (TORULOPSIS) GLABRATA.
Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):       YEAST.
The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.
The NG tube passes below the diaphragm terminating in the stomach.
She was extubated on [**8-18**] after successful prolonged SBT, but reintubated approximately 8 hours later for an increase in work of breathing and O2 requirement.
The possibility of tracheostomy and PEG were discussed with her and her family, but were prevented by the development of fungemia.
A family meeting was held during which her family decided to transition to comfort care and she expired that afternoon.
#Sepsis: The patient presented with neutropenic fever and shock requiring 3 pressors presumed secondary to sepsis from GI source given signs of colitis on CT imaging.
She was weaned off pressors and completed 14 day course of Metronidazole and Cefepime.
She was also briefly on PO/PR vancomycin which was discontinued after multiple C diff assays were negative.
As above, she again developed signs of sepsis on [**8-26**] from presumed pulmonary source given poor oxygenation and diffuse bilateral infiltrates on CXR and broad antibiotic coverage was restarted.
The possibility of tracheostomy and PEG placement were discussed with planned possible discharge to LTACH, but the patient developed fungemia before this was pursued.
#Fungemia: Blood cultures from [**8-21**] grew [**Female First Name (un) **] and pt was started on micafungin for planned 4 week course, PICC line removed.
#Anemia: HGB/HCT trended down with initial HCT 38.8 and subsequent HCT in low to mid 20s requiring 5 blood transfusions throughout her admission.
#Colitis: Pt was followed by GI and started on high dose IV steroids for presumed Crohn's flare with slow taper (5mg/wk).
She was also covered broadly with antibiotics for potential infectious etiology.
#Edema: Pt became anasarcic with fluid resuscitation for sepsis.
Diuresed briefly with lasix drip after which she showed brisk auto-diuresis with improvement in appearance of edema and return to near baseline weight.
It was likely related to her initial hypotension, IV contrast,underlying multiple myeloma.
Received DDAVP and several platelet transfusions prior to line placements.
#Ileus: Pt had profuse, bilious output from NG/OG and was started on Erythromycin for gut motility with some improvement.
Pain was managed with fentanyl boluses, agitation managed with olazepine and midazolam.
#ELEVATED INR: INR noted to be elevated to peak 1.9, likely due to combination of poor nutrition and antibiotic therapy.
Conservative managment with transfusions continued during hospitalization.
