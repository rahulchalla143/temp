Interval placement of an endotracheal tube which has its tip approximately 10 cm above the carina.
The tube should be advanced approximately 4 cm.
Disc degenerative changes are also present at C6-C7 level with narrowing of the intervertebral disc space, Schmorl's node and endplate changes are visualized at this level, consistent with bone marrow replacement for fat (image 8, series 16).
CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: A tiny amount of hyperdense material is seen in a right frontal sulcus (2:20) and a right temporal sulcus (2:14) concerning for subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There has been further ventricular dilatation since the remote MR study of [**2163-2-12**], but this more likely reflects progressive global, including central atrophy, rather than developing hydrocephalus.
-------------------INTERPHASE FISH ANALYSIS, 100-300 CELLS-------------------   nuc ish(D7Z1,D7S522)x1[43/100], (EGR1x1,D5S23/D5S721x2)[30/100],(D8Z1x2),(D20S108x2)[100] FISH evaluation for a 7q deletion was performed with the Vysis LSI D7S522/CEP7 Dual Color Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for D7S522 at 7q31 and CEP7 (D7Z1) (chromosome 7 alpha satellite DNA) at 7p11.1-q11.1 and is interpreted as ABNORMAL.
A single D7S522/D7Z1 hybridization signal was observed in 43/100 nuclei, which exceeds the normal range (up to 3% MONOSOMY 7) established for this probe in the Cytogenetics Laboratory at [**Hospital1 18**].
A single hybridization signal was observed in 30/100 nuclei examined, which exceeds the normal range (up to 3% EGR1 deletion) established for this probe in the Cytogenetics Laboratory at [**Hospital1 18**].
FISH evaluation for a chromosome 8 aneuploidy was performed with the D8Z2 DNA Probe (chromosome 8 alpha satellite DNA) ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) at 8p11.1- q11.1 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
Two hybridization signals were detected in 94/100 nuclei examined, which is within the normal range established for this probe in the Cytogenetics Laboratory at [**Hospital1 18**].
A normal chromosome 8 FISH finding can result from absence of trisomy for chromosome 8 or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
FISH evaluation for a 20q deletion was performed with the Vysis LSI D20S108 Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) at 20q12 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
Two hybridization signals were observed in 97/100 nuclei examined, which is within the normal range established for this probe in the Cytogenetics Laboratory at [**Hospital1 18**].
A normal 20q FISH finding can result from absence of a 20q deletion, from a 20q deletion that does not involve the region to which this probe hybridizes, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
DIAGNOSIS: HYPERCELLULAR MARROW WITH EXTENSIVE FIBROSIS, TRILINEAGE DYSPLASIA, AND INCREASED MYELOBLASTS.
Note: The findings are highly suspicious for a myelodysplastic disorder best classified as refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB-2) based on the number of myeloblasts in the peripheral blood (a marrow aspirate could not be obtained) and the core biopsy immunostained with CD34.
However, given the clinical presentation of the patient with severe anemia and acute high output cardiac failure the findings in this marrow need to be interpreted with caution and a follow up biopsy is highly recommended, unless cytogenetic studies confirm myelodysplastic syndrome or other related myeloproloferative disorder.
Erythrocytes exhibit anisopoikilocytosis, targets, bite cells, elliptocytes, dacrocytes, and show polychromasia and basophilic stippling.
Erythroid precursors are increased and exhibit dyspoietic maturation.
Myeloid precursors are decreased in number and exhibit dysplastic maturation.
Megakaryocytes are increased and exhibit dysplastic maturation.
E-Cadherin and glycophorin-A highlight erythroblasts.
There is a greater percentage of cells staining for glycophorin-A than E-cadherin which is immunoreactive in about one third of the cells, indicating that the majority of the erythroblasts are undergoing maturation.
CD68 stains most myeloid precursors as well as increased marrow histiocytes.
Previous biopsies:   	[**-1/5104**]  BON E MARROW CORE BX ILIAC CREST (1 JAR)   FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT  FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING The following tests (antibodies) were performed:  HLA-DR, Glycophorin A, Kappa, Lambda, and CD antigens 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11c, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 33, 34, 41, 56, 64, 71, 117.
A second population which express only low levels of CD45 lacks all lymphoid and myeloid markers but is positive for CD71 and glycophorin-a and represent erythroblasts.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 yo M with advanced progressive multiple sclerosis presenting with increasing fatigue/weakness, b/l LE swelling, and pancytopenia, bone marrow consistent with MDS, course complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure, DVT/PE, Pneumonia, ICH.
Differential included PE (patient with DVT found on LE ultrasound), transfusion associated circulatory overload [**2-14**] to rapid multiple transfusions, and less likely pneumonia.
Patient treated for DVT (potential PE) with heparin drip.
Extubation was performed on HD 5, however patient was extremely tachypnic and required re-intubation.
Antibiotics were restarted with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin and patient completed a ten day course.
He was diuresed over the next several days with IV lasix (bolus and drip) for treatment of transfusion associated circulatory overload.
Negative inspiratory force was low, but gradually improved and on HD 10, patient was successfully extubated.
His respiratory status continued to improve and he had saturations in the mid to high 90s on room air at the time of discharge.
Patient was placed on heparin drip with goal PTT 60-80 given patient's high risk of bleeding given his pancytopenia.
He was kept on heparin drip while intubated, and upon extubation and clearance by speech and swallow he was transitioned to lovenox and given one dose of warfarin.
Lovenox was however discontinued due to thrombocytopenia.
The patient therefore underwent successful placement of an IVC filter by IR.
Sedation may also have contributed to hypotension.
Right IJ placed, but patient did not require pressor support.
Patient treated with supportive blood products, transfusion threshold Hct<21 and Plt<30.
Patient required a total of 12 units of pRBC and 14 units of platelets throughout hospitalization.
He was started on neupogen 480mcg daily per BMT recommendations, this was discontinued on discharge as he was no longer acutely infected.
Once patient's respiratory status was stabilized, he was transferred to BMT floor for further management.
Given the patients current deconditioned status he is not a good candidate for therapy at this time.
For now he will be managed with transfusion support.
Oxacarbazepam was initially held as concern for cause of pancytopenia, however it was restarted once bone marrow showed MDS.
Patient complained of worsening right greater than left upper and lower extremity weakness, which improved following extubation, but was still quite debilitating.
Each time he was given adenosine 6 mg once with return of sinus rhythm and improvement in his blood pressure.
Following the second episode he was started on metoprolol tartrate which was titrated upward to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].
The patient was given vitamin K to reverse the coumadin he had received that day, FFP and platelets.
Infectious work-up including blood cultures and urine cultures were negative though the patient was undergoing treatment of pneumonia.
He was given vitamin K 5 mg x 2.
He was started on PO vitamin K 5 mg weekly.
This medication should be continued on discharge.
His INR should be monitored at rehab with discontinuation of medication when INR is within normal limits.
This was treated with free water flushes via OG tube while patient was intubated.
Trended back to baseline with transfusions and remained stable throughout hospitalization.
# Hyperuricemia: Uric acid was 11.0.
Patient was started on allopurinol to decrease uric acid level as there was concern that high level may be contributing to acute kidney injury.
His allopurinol dose was decreased to 100 mg daily prior to discharge.

You were also found to have very low blood counts due to your bone marrow not working properly.
You were given blood and platelets.
Since your blood counts are low we cannot give you blood thinners to treat the clot so a filter was placed in one of your blood vessels to prevent it from traveling to your lungs.
We started you on medication to help control your rate.
We made the following changes to your medications 1.
STOP Naltrexone 3.
START Metoprolol tartrate 25 mg twice a day 6.
START allopurinol 100 mg daily 7.
START tylenol as needed for pain 9.
START vitamin K 5 mg every week 10.
