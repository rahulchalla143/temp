Following his recent admission ([**Date range (1) 9476**]), during which he required lasix gtt for diuresis and was discharged on torsemide, he was discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab where he was noted to be tachycardic and hypotensive with SBP 70s-80s on day of admission.
He received IV vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and flagyl.
He became hypotensive requiring IV fluids but also showing signs of respiratory distress with tachypnea and oxygen desaturations.
He was intubated in the ED, a right IJ was placed, and he was started on levophed prior to transfer to MICU.

IMAGING STUDIES: [**2102-3-25**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements.
However, patient also with notable elevated WBC count, grossly positive UA, and CXR suggestive of possible PNA so patient was covered broadly with vancomycin and cefepime.
Patient was initially started on flagyl as well given patient's questionable endorsement of abdominal discomfort on presentation but as CT Abdomen was negative, flagyl was discontinued on HD #3.
Despite initial volume resuscitation, patient remained pressor dependent for a majority of his hospital course with MAPs >55 on phenylephrine and vasopressin.
Though his lactate trended down, his central venous O2 sats were greater than 70 indicating persistent septic physiology despite appropriate antibiotic treatment.
Pt was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 9476**] for CHF exacerbation, had been getting aggressive diuresis until recently.
His electrolytes remained within normal limits but he became progressively volume overloaded, failing to respond appropriately to diuresis with a lasix gtt partly due to persistently low blood pressures.
Family felt dialysis was not consistent with patient's long-term goals of care so lasix diuresis was discontinued when patient was transitioned to CMO.
Throughout his hospital stay, patient would intermittently go into afib with RVR v SVT with an accompanying drop in blood pressures that would spontaneously convert to NSR or require lopressor 2.5mg IV prn.
Hydrated with half normal saline initially and then transitioned to fluid resuscitation.
Was continued on baby aspirin but his metoprolol was held in the setting of hypotension.
Incontinent at baseline, dependent on all ADLs.
Patient was discharged from the ICU on glycopyrrolate and morphine gtt for comfort.
