She was started on a llidocaine patch, tylenol 650mg q6h, tramadol 50mg q6h prn, and morphine 0.5-1mg IV prn for breakthrough pain.
This was thought to be narcotic induced and received Narcan x 2.
She improved and in discussion with attending, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on the morning of [**2192-9-5**],  Ultram was stopped and ibuprofen was started despite risk of bleeding due to the fact that the benefits outweighed the risk (her GI bleed was many years ago and because she has been on PPIs it was felt that she could tolerate NSAIDS).
She was continued on Tylenol, Ibuprofen, Neurontin, and lidoderm patches.
She had been recently discharged on Lisinopril, HCTZ, and Metoprolol which were continued.
