# Burkitt's Lymphoma: Pericardial fluid was kappa light chain restricted CD10 positive monotypic B cells expressing FMC-7, CD19, CD20, and myc rearrangement consistent with Burkitt's Lymphoma.
Chemotherapy using the [**Doctor Last Name 98945**] regimen for Burkitt's lymphoma was started and the patient tolerated it well.
Tumor lysis/DIC labs were drawn every 8 hours and the patient was started on D5W with bicarb and allopurinol for prohylaxis.
She will continue Acyclovir prophylaxis and will report to the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] 7 Clinical center for an appointment with Drs.
She will receive chemotherapy later that morning, to be administered by the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] 7 nursing staff.

Geberal surgery originally suggested follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for cholecystectomy 2-4 weeks after discharge.
# Hx seizure: Once chemotherapy was started, neuro was consulted and the patient was switched to Keppra from Dilantin because of the possibility of drug-drug reactions with Dilantin.
She tolerated the switch well and will continue this regimen as an outpatient.

Neuro was confident that she was no longer at an increased risk for intracranial bleeding and anticoagulation was discontinued when chemotherapy was started.
As a result, her PICC line was removed prior to discharge with the understanding that a new PICC line would need to be placed when she returns for her next hospital admission on [**9-1**].
