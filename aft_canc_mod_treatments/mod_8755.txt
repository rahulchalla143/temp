The patient was noted at rehab to be febrile to 103 today, and was also complaining of a "total body itchiness" and was noted both at rehab and by the ED attending to have trunk and arm erythema.
He was started on keflex yesterday for possible superficial phlebitis at an old PIV site, and denies any localizing symptoms including HA, menigismus, cough, shortness of breath, dysuria, n/v/d.
Of note, the patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] under the Neurosurgical service from [**Date range (1) 30844**] after a fall with bilateral SDH, and underwent right craniotomy on [**11-5**], and ultimately was discharged to rehab on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.

Last Updated on [**2160-11-17**]  Brief Hospital Course: 75 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HCV cirrhosis complicated by HCC s/p lobe resection in [**2156**], who presented on post-operative day 12 from craniotomy for a subdural hematoma with fever, rash, and hypotension.
Given recent craniotomy the neurosurgery service was consulted and was not concerned for CNS infection.
The patient did receive a dose of Vancomycin and Levofloxacin in the ED but none were continued in the ICU as the patient remained afebrile and the ICU team's suspicion for infectious process was low.
The patient recieved a dose of IV steroids in the ED and subsequently recieved a 3 day course of Prednisone 60mg.
Dilantin was considered as a possible etiology for his presentation, especially given the acute renal failure and associated morbilliform rash, as a type IV drug reaction, including DRESS, though no eosinophilia was noted on differential.
Adittionally patient had recently been started on Keflex so anaphylactic shock due to allergy to cephalosporins is another possibility.
Both dilantin and Keflex were discontinued and should be avoided in the future.
