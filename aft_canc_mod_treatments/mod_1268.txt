He had a negative metastatic survey and underwent mediastinoscopy with no pathologic findings one day prior to this admission.
We recommended sleeve upper lobectomy as he had adequate, but not exceptional lung function.
This was approximately 10 years ago, treated with radiation therapy at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with no evidence of recurrence to date.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient underwent the sleeve resection on [**2118-11-9**].
He was on pressors briefly in the operating room but otherwise tolerated the procedure well.
He received one unit of blood on POD1 for Hct of 26 to which he responded well.
He was also given magnesium and calcium gluconate acutely and labs were sent.
Patient was confused at the time and his urine output remained borderline throughout the night.
The patient was not anticoagulated given his recent surgery and presence of epidural.
He remained stable in the ICU and after a repeat bronchoscopy was deemed stable enough for transfer back to the floor the next day.
Patient had brief episodes of atrial fibrillation both while in the unit and once transfered back to the floor which resolved with titration of the beta blocker.
The epidural and both chest tubes were removed on POD4.
Bedside swallow demonstrated the patient was at significant risk for anpiration and tube feeds were started on [**11-14**] with nutrution recommendations.
As the patient's mental status started to clear he was seen by physical therapy and geriatrics medicine continued to follow, however he continued to have difficulty clearing secretions and on [**11-16**] he was again bronch'd after a chest x-ray demonstrated worsened atelectasis.
Intermittent diuresis combined with bronchoscopy as described resulted in significant improvement in his pulmonary status.
Patient received atropine, epinephrine and bicarbonate x4 with no response.
