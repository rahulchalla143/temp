Despite bleeding risk, it was recommended to proceed with surgical revascularization as this is more desirable prior to possible proctectomy.
Bedside wound debridement was performed and wet to dry dressing were applied.
He remained stable on medical therapy and was eventually cleared for surgery.
On [**2-5**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] performed coronary artery bypass grafting surgery with concomitant Maze procedure.
Given inpatient stay was greater than 24 hours prior to surgery, Vancomycin was given for perioperative antibiotic coverage.
The patient developed bradycardia post-operatively while receiving amiodarone and became dependent on temporary pacer.
Recommendations included to discontinue amiodarone and start dofetilide with the goal of keeping the patient in sinus rhythm, as he is not a suitable candidate for anti-coagulation given his rectal mass and risk of bleeding.
He continued to progress and tolerated dofetilide with no further bradycardia.
Podiatry also debrided his left foot ulcer on [**2-10**] and to continue with wet to dry dressing changes.
