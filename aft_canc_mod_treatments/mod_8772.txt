Brief Hospital Course: 85 yom with a. fib, chf (ef 35%), MVR, gerd and on anticoagulation with coumadin at home admitted with BRBPR, thought to be bleeding diverticuli in the setting of anticoagulation.

It is possible that the patient was dehydrated, and we hung maintenance fluids of NS at 100cc/hr.

Given his stable hct we restarted low dose heparin (goal PTT 60-80) without bolus.
