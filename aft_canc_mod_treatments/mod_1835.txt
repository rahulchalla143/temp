Continue tube feed prevalence at 45 cc/hr via G tube.
Consider cycling the tube feed prevalence full strength at 65 cc/16 hours (1248 kcal, 56 grams) to allow time off pump.
If the patient is unable to maintain weight, consider increasing tube feed rate/time as tolerated.
Pain:  Due to the patient's persistent pain, an analgesic regimen was changed as follows:  The oxycodone-acetaminophen elixir was changed to standing 10 mL po q.
OxyContin was considered, however, it was felt that this pill, which cannot be crushed, would not be able to fit through the G tube and as such, standing more frequent immediate release medications were recommended.
Goals of care:  Upon further discussion with the patient, she clarified her goals further, stating that she wants to be comfort measures only, no additional hospitalizations, no procedures, no prolonged intravenous antibiotics, no intubation, no CPR, no resuscitation and no medications that would be used prophylactically, other than those that would be directed towards the patient's primary and only goal of comfort care.
The patient should have a palliative care/hospice evaluation at the rehabilitation setting and will likely be transitioned from acute rehabilitation to long-term rehabilitation with hospice nursing care.
