Admission Date:  [**2135-11-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-12-19**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6378**] Chief Complaint: [**Last Name (un) **] pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cholecystectomy, ileostomy take down  History of Present Illness: 85M transferred from surgery.
Had colon cancer s/p colectomy [**4-11**], complicated by ileal perf leading to ileostomy.
Originally planned for ileosotomy revision on [**11-30**], however, presented to ED [**11-25**] w/ abdominal pain, found to have acute cholecystitis.
Myelodysplastic syndrome 16. colon cancer s/p colectomy [**4-11**], complicated by ileal perf leading to ileostomy placement 17.
Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia on prednisone 18. adrenal insufficiency 19. abdominal abscess [**10-12**]  Social History: Founder of Juliard String Quartet.
ABDOMEN: Active bowel sounds, mildly firm, nontender, dressing/wound CDI, 2X2 in place.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Rifampin should not be used alone for therapy.
Brief Hospital Course: 85M MDS/CMML with colon cancer, status post resection complicated by ileotomy requiring ileostomy placement, here for cholecystectomy (for cholecystitis) and ileostomy takedown.
Therefore, as patient was scheduled to undergo ileostomy takedown within the week of presentation, patient underwent both cholecystectomy and ileostomy takedown on hospital day 4.
Patient initially tolerated the procedure well, however post-operative course was complicated by hypotension requiring transfer to the surgical ICU.
Patient was stabilized on pressors and a Swan Ganz catheter was placed.
Patient was found to have bilateral pulmonary consolidations with sputum notable for methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and klebisiella, therefore, vancomycin and meropenem were administered for treatment based upon susceptibility profiles.
Subsequently, patient went into acute renal failure, felt to be secondary to episode of hypotension - medications were adjusted for renal dosing.
* Cholecystectomy/Ileostomy takedown: Post-operative course was complicated as above, however, surgical wound responded appropriately to [**Hospital1 **] wet-to-dry dressing changes with healing by secondary intention.
Of note, at one point during post-op course, wound was thought to be draining purulent material, however, this was self-limited, and at the time of discharge, patient's wound had development of excellent granulation tissue and no evidence of infection.
Patient had a PICC placed on hospital day 17 in anticipation of discharge on IV antibiotics.
Of note, patient's creatinine improved with further Lasix-mediated diuresis, and during the week prior to discharge patient was given Lasix 40-80mg IV with a goal of 500cc-1L out daily.
As patient was having less response to Lasix diuresis in final days prior to discharge, patient was given a one time dose of acetazolamide to stimulate further diuresis as bicarbonate was noted to be 33 (thought to be due to contraction/lasix diuresis).
In discussion with patient's primary hematologist, as infectious causes were ruled out, it was felt that these elevations (to max 60,000, ~30% monocytes) were due to exaggerated white cell production/mobilization secondary to chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.
Patient was treated empirically with oral vancomycin, to be continued 10 days following discharge.
Patient's prednisone was tapered to 10mg QOD at the time of discharge.
* Anemia/Hemolysis:  Patient was found to have elevated LDH 377, with haptoglobin <20, however, no schistocytes on smear and no elevation in coagulation factors were noted.
However, patient did require two units of packed red cells over the course of the week prior to discharge, felt to be required secondary to combination of low grade hemolysis (from infection), CMML, and myelodysplastic syndrome.
Patient was transfused with parameters of hematocrit>30%, as patient has previously been symptomatic below that level, and patient was transfused the day of discharge.
* Aspiration/Nutrition:  Although patient initially failed a swallow study while in SICU, patient later did well on a second swallow study.
Patient did initially require NG tube feeds as PO intake was not adequate.
However, a week prior to discharge, patient's NG tube was removed (as he was complaining of inability to eat with tube in place) and given one liter of total parenteral nutrition as a bridge.
Patient was discharged with instructions to continue Lasix 80mg PO daily, with 20meq Potassium chloride supplementation daily, and hematocrit/Chem7 to be checked four days following discharge.
