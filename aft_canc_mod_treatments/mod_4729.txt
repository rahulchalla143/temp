Pain was controlled in house with fentanyl patch and dialudid.
Pt was initially started on levo but zosyn was ordered as well.
Pt had three triggers for hypoxia and required 10L of face mask for some time to maintain sats.

The cause was thought to be multifactorial, related to worsening invasion of metastatic NSCLC with right lobe collapse and right pleural effusion.
He was started on levofloxacin.
He required frequent suctioning and tolerated sats in the high 80s to low 90s on ventimask and nonrebreather.
Vanc and zosyn were added for HCAP coverage.
Prn nebs were given for any COPD component.
The patient began to desaturate and experience air hunger on [**11-7**] and was treated with hydromorphone drip at the suggestion of palliative care.
Started hydromorphone PCA and increasing fentanyl patch to 275mcg/hr [**2117-11-4**] and pt appears to be better.
Gabapentin started.
MR L spine was held due to pt inability to tolerate given dyspnea and hypoxia.
# SVC SYNDROME/SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR:  Pt on warfarin due to migration of SVC stent that was placed for SVC syndrome.
Supratherapeutic INR likely in the setting of coumadin and levofloxacin.
Coumadin was held and INR was ???
Appetite improved with pain control and bowel regimen.
MR L spine held due to pt respiratory distress.
Palliative care was consulted for pain management recommendations.
Discussion with oncologist resulted in decision to proceed with DNR/DNI code status given his poor prognosis.
