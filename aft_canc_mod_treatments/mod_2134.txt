She was continued on meropenem, vanco, given 2L NS and started on stress dose steroids.
She spiked to 101.7 so blood cultures were again drawn and she was started on Flagyl for possible Cdiff.
ONC HISTORY: Acute myelogenous leukemia - status post allogenic transplant [**2110-8-4**]: 5 of 6 matched family member (father) allogenic BMT.
Of note she was found to have anti HLA B7 and B27 antibodies so required matched platelet transfusions during her nadir.
She then underwent reinduction with MEC in [**10-10**].
She received high-dose ARA-C starting [**2114-11-29**].
Past Medical History: - Allergic rhinitis - Depression - Right-sided hydronephrosis secondary to fibroid uterus/retroperitneal fibrosis thought secondary to paraneoplastic syndrome, status post stent [**6-9**], removed [**8-9**]  - Left-sided hydronephrosis, status post nephrostomy tube placement [**2114-10-4**] - History of Lactobacillus bacteremia treated with Meropenem during admission [**Date range (3) 48091**] - Gastroesophageal reflux disease - Chronic fatigue   Social History: Married, lives with her husband (who is a nurse) and three children ages 14, 9, 7.
L nephrostomy tube in place - no drainage, d/c or tenderness.
The preexistent tube was then removed over the guidewire leaving the guidewire in situ in exchanged for a new 8-French nephrostomy tube.
The catheter was secured using an 0-silk retention suture at the skin entry site, reinforced with an 8-French StatLock device.
The puncture site in the drainage catheter was dressed with drain sponges, overlaid with Tegaderm transparent semi-occlusive dressing patches.
The catheter was capped and left in place.
Status post over-the-wire exchange of left-sided 8-French nephrostomy tube, which was left capped.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 50 yo woman with AML who is s/p allogenic BMT five years ago, and presented recently with a donor cell AML and is s/p reinduction with MEC and then HIDAC on [**11-29**] who was admitted with hypotension and gram positive sepsis.
#) Hypotension/[**Name (NI) 15305**] Pt was admitted with SBP's in low 80's responsive to IV fluid boluses.
Given the patient's chronic steroid use and hypotension she was started on stress dose steroids for relative adrenal insufficiency.
Her symptoms of diarrhea and abdominal pain raised suspicion for an intrabdominal source, however her R PICC line was notably painful and erythematous and therefore thought to be the most likely source of infection.
Her right axillary vein PICC line was removed on admission.
And she was started on Vancomycin IV Serial blood cultures later grew coagulase positive Staphylococcus sp sensitive to vancomycin.
The patient was transfused HLA matched platelets for goal greater than 50,000 and anticoagulated with heparin gtt.
She was continued on vancomycin IV after reviewing senstivities and speciation data.
Her antifungal coverage was broadened to voriconazole.
Once afebrile for 48hrs she was switched to PO linezolid.
#) Nephrostomy- Extensive discussion between providers of risks and benefits of nephrostomy tube going into transplant.
Prior to discharge, a nephrostogram revealed caudal stenosis, and was the tube was capped and left in place.
Pt tolerated capping of tube overnight and was discharged with instruction that if she tolerated the capping that it could be removed in 48-72hrs at the discretion of her primary oncologist in consultation with the urology and interventional radiology services.
#) AML- Patient is status post HIDAC on [**11-29**].
The patient was discharged with plan for further chemotherapy within a few days of discharge, with a second attempt at allogenic transplant to follow.
#) Heme- found to have anti-HLA B7 and B27 antibodies and required matched platelet transfusions.
Pt did respond to 1 unit of unmatched platelets given prior to he central venous catheter insertion.
#) F/E/N- Started on TPN during admission + neutropenic diet.
A repeat PICC line was attempted on the left arm, but was unsuccessful due to vasospasm.
Two days prior to discharge with negative surveillance blood cultures and after being afebrile for 48hrs a left sided tunneled internal jugular venous catheter was placed.
