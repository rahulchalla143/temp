VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  [**2112-4-20**] 11:04 AM  FINDINGS: Oral and pharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed today in collaboration with speech and language pathology.
ORAL PHASE: Moderate oral dysphagia is seen, with decreased bolus formation, control and AP tongue movement, as well as increased oral transit times.
Acute renal failure: in setting of diuresis after volume administration.
Echo done which showed severe MR.  Lasix currently on hold.
Zenkers diverticulum: This is a long standing issue ([**2104**]) and the family has declined intervention in the past due to risks involved.
He had a new finding on cxr that was pna vs pneumonitis s/p barium swallow.
He has slight leukocytosis (12.3) and therefore was treated with a course of levofloxacin.
He was made NPO for a few days, maintained with intravenous fluids, and ENT was consulted for recommendations on less invasive repair options.
After discussion with the family it was decided that invasive surgery would not be ideal, but a less invasive procedure would be appropriate given his good functional status at home.
ENT saw the patient and at that point his lethargy and delirium had improved, and they recommended to trial oral feeds again.
He was started on a honey thick puree diet and tolerated this well.
He was given IV PPI and ASA was held.
He was taking Vitamin E over the counter at home.
Last colonoscopy [**2104**] with adenoma polyp removed and repeat suggested in three years, family reports it was not done.
He is currently stable, received Reclast therapy for bone health over the winter, and will follow up in [**2-28**] months.
He had acute congestive heart failure this admission in the setting of fluid volume overload from blood products and intravenous fluid in the ICU during GI bleed.
He was given diuretics and diuresed to baseline.
- Lasix restarted at 20 mg daily.
- Had short runs of NSVT upon admission but improved, monitor K and Mg on lasix.
Urinary retention - Foley catheter was inserted during ICU stay.
Bladder scan showed 700mL and foley was placed for 800mL urine.
Urology was called and they recommended keeping the foley in place and following up as an outpatient.
Maintained on aricept and namenda.
He was also taking vitamin e at home but it was advised that this be discontinued because of risk of bleeding.
They do however prefer less invasive treatment options given his overall age and dementia.
He was given low dose x1 IV haldol in the ICU.

While you were in the hospital you had bleeding from your upper gastroesophageal system and were treated with blood transfusions and intravenous fluids.
You will have follow up with an ENT doctor to help determine if you need a procedure to fix your Zenkers Diverticulum, hopefully it will improve without intervention.
Please do not take Vitamin E any longer, it may contribute to gastrointestinal bleeding.
Please also do not take aspirin until instructed by your doctor.
Your lasix was held for several days but has been restarted at discharge.
