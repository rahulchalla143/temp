Since the transphenoidal resection in [**7-5**] was a subtotal approach (the chiasmatic portion of the adenoma did not fall into the sella once the lower portion of the tumor had been evacuated), the patient is in need of a second stage surgery to ermove the tumor part that sits above the dumbbell waistline.
- Pituitary adenoma s/p resection  Social History: He is married and lives with his wife, daughter, and granddaughter.
Residual neoplasm in the right side of the sella extending into the right cavernous sinus and encasing the right internal carotid artery.
Interval resection of the suprasellar component of the mass.
Expected postoperative changes related to right craniotomy  CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-11-2**] 7:02 PM IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-2**] at 4:33 a.m. and 1:08 p.m.:  New endotracheal tube in standard placement.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-11-3**] 10:07 AM  IMPRESSION: AP chest submitted for review at 4:53 p.m.:  Moderate pulmonary edema unchanged since [**11-3**].
Emphysema, right pleural thickening and pleural calcification have been discussed on prior and subsequent radiographic reports.
ET tube in standard placement.
ET tube in standard placement.
ET tube in standard placement.
Feeding tube ends in the upper stomach.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2125-11-5**] FINDINGS: The endotracheal tube sits 4 cm above the carina.
The endogastric tube tip sits within the stomach, although a portion of the weighted tip sits above the GE junction.
The lungs continue to demonstrate heterogeneous opacity in the right mid and lower portion, which may represent an area of scarring.
Lines and tubes as described above.
MRI BRAIN WITH & WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2125-11-7**] FINDINGS: The patient is status post right frontotemporal craniotomy for resection of pituitary mass.
There is interval resolution of previous pneumocephalus with unchanged right frontal and temporal tip extra-axial fluid collection (measuring 10 or 5 mm in maximal thickness).
More prominent fluid collection along the medial aspect of the right temporal muscle that does not demonstrate ring enhancement or restricted diffusion, likely consistent with seroma.
The tip of the Dobbhoff catheter projects over the middle parts of the stomach.
Feeding tube ends in the upper stomach.
The Dobbhoff tube tip passes below the diaphragm with its tip not included in the field of view.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for a stage 2 resection of pituitary adenoma.
On [**10-31**] he underwent right subfrontal craniotomy  for resection of the tumor under general anesthesia.
Intraoperatively he was found to be hypothermic and thus postoperatively he remained intubated on transfer to the ICU where he was rewarmed and then extubated.
He was given DDAVP and IVF boluses to match urine output.
On [**11-2**], the patient was reintubated after extreme agitation and acute hypoxic event.The patient was given a total of 40 mg IV lasix for pulmonary edema and crackles heard over the lung bases.
DDAVP was given twice over for treatment of Diabetes Inspipidus.
The patient was given Lasix 20 mg and D5W at 75 cc/hr was initiated to correct hypernatremia.
An attempt was made to wean the patient from sedation medication in hopes to extubate the patient.
Propofol was discontinued and precedex was initiated.
On [**11-5**], Tube feedings were at goal at a rate of 60 cc/hr, the patient had had no bowel movement and was given a fleets enema with results.
The patient was patient was started on VANComycin, zosyn, cipro for treatment of VAP.
Tube feedings remained at goal a goal of 60 cc hr via the dophoff and free water per endo 250 every four hours continued.
He was on CPAP and ABG was within normal limits but BAL from [**11-4**] revealed multiple organisms therefore an ID Consult was requested.
ID recommended discontinuign his cipro and vancomycin and keeping Zosyn for H. flu and anerobe coverage.
He also had another bronchoscopy and washigns were sent for culture and evaluation.
On [**11-8**] he was planned to recieve a PICC line and his fre water boluses were discussed with endocrinology who recommended keeping them at 200ml every 4 hours.
He remained intubated overnight.
Endocrine asked to decrease his PM dose of hydrocortisone to 10mg, send t4, thrb, and free t4, and add levothyroxine 50mcg QD.
All medications were changed to PO.
ID final recs are to continue Zosyn for a full 8 day course, last dose given [**11-13**].
On [**11-14**] Pt's serum Na bumped to 151 and he was started on Intranasal ddAVP 10mcg [**Hospital1 **] per endocrinology as they felt he was in mild DI and was unable to match his intake with his output.
At the time of discharge he is tolerating a regular ground solid and thin liquid diet, ambulating with assistance, afebrile with stable vital signs.
