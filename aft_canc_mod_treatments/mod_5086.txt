Tunneled hemodialysis line placement [**2163-1-17**]  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old woman with CAD (S/p BMS to mid LAD in [**2159**]), sCHF (EF 40%), PVD s/p R axillobifemoral bypass with graft which the fem-fem is now occluded, carotid endarterectomy x 2 on the left last in [**2158**], s/p SMA PCI, COPD (on 2L NC), PEs on coumadin who presents intubated/sedated from [**Hospital3 **] in setting of acute pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, oliguric [**Last Name (un) **], and critical left main disease.
She had recently been discharged after treatment of pneumonia (unknown antibiotic course), and while at home in days after discharge, developed progressive dyspnea and possible fever.
She was started on Zpack, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin for pneumonia/COPD exacerbation, and given IV lasix 20mg tid for pulmonary edema.
She does not take lasix as an outpatient.
Lasix was discontinued and renal consult was obtained, who recommended stopping lasix, giving IVF for pre-renal azotemia, and changing levofloxacin to ampicillin.
ID and heme/onc consultations were obtained for leukocytosis 19 with left shift.
Patient was initiated on HD 4 days prior to transfer, received third run of HD today, during which she developed acute left-sided chest pain, [**8-31**], not radiating.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p PCI to LAD ([**2159**]) CHF L CEA R axillobifemoral bypass with graft mult foot/ankle surgeries HTN COPD on home O2 (2L nightly, occasionally during the day) s/p nephrectomy incarcerated umbilical hernia s/p repair [**8-29**] acute cholecystitis s/p cholecystostomy drainage [**8-29**] asthma PE x 2 on coumadin CKD Ischemic colitis, chronic s/p celiac and SMA stents Bladder cancer: Recent treatment history at [**Hospital3 **], she's had 3 procedures in the past couple years including chemical bath of the bladder.
Patient to remain on aspirin and clopidogrel indefinitely, without interruption.
Interventional [**2163-1-17**] IMPRESSION: Successful exchange of a temporary hemodialysis catheter for a 23 cm tunneled hemodialysis catheter.
The catheter tip is in the right atrium.
On Discharge: 140  98  50 ----------------< 106 4.8  30  4.2  Ca: 8.8 Mg: 2.6 P: 7.4 &#8710;  WBC-17.4 Hb-8.7 Hct-25.7 Plt-540 PT: 26.1  PTT: 150  INR: 2.5    Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old woman with CAD (S/p BMS to mid LAD in [**2159**]), sCHF (EF 40%), PVD s/p R axillobifemoral bypass with graft which the fem-fem is now occluded, carotid endarterectomy x 2 on the left last in [**2158**], s/p SMA PCI, COPD (on 2L NC), PEs on coumadin who presents intubated/sedated from OSH in setting of acute pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, oliguric [**Last Name (un) **], and critical left main disease.
Active Diagnoses: # CAD: Cardiac cath showed 90% LM, 70% RCA lesion, no intervention was performed initially.
Patient was initially on a heparin gtt and nitro gtt.
She was continued on coreg 3.125 mg [**Hospital1 **], captopril 6.25 mg tid, plavix 75 mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg daily, aspirin 325 mg daily.
She is to not stop aspirin or plavix without speaking to her cardiologist.
Patient was initially intubated at OSH for respiratory distress, thought to be secondary to pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
CVVH was later initiated for volume management.
Patient did well with RISB and SBTs, and was extubated once volume removal was achieved with dialysis.
She remains on 2L NC on discharge, but oxygenates well on room air to 2L NC.
CVVH was continued to correct toxic-metabolic disturbances.
Although patient had R ICA stenosis, intervention was felt to be too high risk, and risks would likely outweigh benefits.
On admission to OSH, Cr was 1.4, but with diuresis had bumped to 4.8.
Was initially thought to be pre-renal, but after discontinuing lasix and giving IVF, did not show improvement in renal function, so likely ATN.
Was initiated on HD at OSH 4 days prior to transfer, had received 3 cycles at OSH.
Patient was maintaed on CVVH during this hospitalization.
A temporary dialysis catheter was placed, and a tunneled line was then placed.
She will continue hemodialysis in rehab and outpatient setting.
Of note, renal recovery is possible for this patient and the need for HD should be continuously reassessed.
# UTI: Had enterococcus UTI at OSH and received 5 day course of Unasyn prior to transfer.
As patient was treated for infection, leukocytosis trended down to 20s.
# Vasculopathy:  Patient is s/p R axillobifemoral bypass with graft which the fem-fem is now occluded, carotid endarterectomy x 2 on the left last in [**2158**], s/p SMA PCI.
She has been chronically anticoagulated on coumadin, but coumadin was held for HD line placement at OSH.
Patient was later started on plavix and aspirin this admission and maintained on a heparin gtt.
Heparin gtt was discontinued when INR was 2.5.
