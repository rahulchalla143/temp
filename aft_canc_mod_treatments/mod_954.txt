Mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus   Brief Hospital Course: 84 yo male with PMHx sx for lymphoma, upper GIB, cardiomyopathy, who presented with an upper GI bleed with multiple gastric ulcers seen on endoscopy, likely secondary to NSAID use and recent high dose prednisone with CHOP therapy for lymphoma.
