Her recently placed port was removed and adhesions were lysed.
A JP drain was placed.
She was kept on assist control ventilation given the concern for septic shock.
A right internal jugular central venous catheter and arterial line were placed, and the patient was volume resuscitated.
Her mean arterial pressures and urine output were finally optimized, consistently >65 and 30cc/kg/hr respectively after about 11L of NS over 36 hour, she did not require any pressors to achieve this.
She was continued on a regimen of vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl for presumed gram negative sepsis.
Vancomycin was discontinued on her third ICU day and she was transferred to GYN for further management.
Upon arrival to the GYN surgical floor on POD#4 until her discharge on POD#8, she received routine postoperative care.
She was transitioned from the fentanyl PCA to dilaudid SC, then subsequently to oral medications with her pain well controlled.
Given that she remained afebrile for greater than 48hours, the remaining antibiotics were discontinued.
Given that she was able to take in adequate amount of fluid, her IV fluids were discontinued.
Her right internal jugular line was removed on POD#8.
