Was found to have UTI, also had urinary retention requiring Foley placement.
Was initially admitted to floor, but developed recurrent hypotension requiring ICU transfer, aggressive IVFs, and pressor support.
He was later restarted on ceftriaxone given concern for recurrent UTI, but this was d/c'd after 2 days given rising Cr and concern for AIN (urine eos positive).
For his Afib/tachy-brady syndrome, he was continued on his digoxin.
Metoprolol initially held given hypotension, and was restarted at a lower dose.
Coagulopathy presumed secondary to antibiotic therapy and poor nutrition.
Developed diarrhea which was presumed secondary to antibiotic use; C. diff was negative.
His code status was changed to DNR/DNI prior to discharge, and per records pt and his daughter were considering transition to comfort focused care and possible hospice.
Labs notable for WBC 21.2 with 85.7% N, Hct 26.4 (recent baseline 24-28), BUN/Cr 44/2.4 (baseline Cr 1.2, though was 2.1 on discharge [**2115-10-15**]), lactate 1.3.
Patient did not urinate and refused straight cath; therefore no UA/urine culture obtained.
ED unable to reach patient's daughter, but given recent discussions of transitioning to comfort care, they held off on CVL placement and initiation of pressors.
He is admitted now to ICU for further management of his hypotension.
Occasional abdominal pain and nausea with certain foods.

10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..   Brief Hospital Course: 58M with history of metastatic bladder cancer s/p XRT, [**Month/Year (2) 3454**], prostate cancer s/p brachytherapy, CHF with LVEF (25%), HTN, DM, and recent ICU admission for sepsis secondary to UTI, presenting now with decreased PO intake, recurrent hypotension, worsening leukocytosis, and worsening renal function.
Pt's morphine was discontinued for concern over neurotoxic metabolites.
Pallative care saw pt and recommended starting fetanyl patch and PO Dilaudid PRN.
Pt was also given Olanzepine at night so that he would be more comfortable and less agitated.
Pt's medications for chronic health issues (ie blood pressure meds, etc) were discontinued to adhere to pt's goals of care.
WBC initially trending down with broad spectrum antibiotics 21.2 -> 19.0 but 24.4 again on [**10-20**].
Hypotension could be related to volume depletion given recent decrease in PO intake, and did improve with IVF overnight.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc/zosyn (holding cefepime given concern for AIN) on [**10-18**].
Antibiotics were discontinued as a family meeting was held with pt and his daughter and the decision was made to transition to comfort focused care.
DDx includes delirium secondary to possible infection, narcotics use, renal function; poor perfusion in setting of hypotension.
He was worked up and treated empirically for possible infection as above with antibiotics being discontinued once decision made with family to transition to comfort focused care.
Metoprolol increased from 25mg TID to 50mg TID and later discontinued once decision made with family to transition to comfort focused care.
#[**Last Name (un) **] on CRI: Cr initially trended down from 2.4 to 2.2 after fluid resuscitation but trended back up to 2.5 on [**10-20**].
Also concern for CIN given recent contrast CT scans.
After family meeting with patient's oncology team, decision was made to avoid aggressive treatment and focus on pain control and symptom management, given poor prognosis.
Pain appears to be well controlled per patient; home doses of morphine were continued.
#DM: Home insulin 70/30 14 units [**Hospital1 **] was continued as well as ISS until decision made with family to transition to comfort focused care.
Insulin was then discontinued.
#HTN: Initially decreased dose metoprolol given recent hypotension.
