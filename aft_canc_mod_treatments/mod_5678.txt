After dialysis on [**10-20**] and again today he was found to be hypotensive to the 70s systolic.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, palpitations, orthopnea, PND and syncope and ankle edema.

Bilateral drainage catheters are noted within these pleural effusions.
No findings within the left upper quadrant of the abdomen to explain patient's symptoms.
The procedure was complicated by patient disorientation during the PCI, ultimately requiring intubation.

The tip of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 1 cm more proximal than before.

Hypotension was responsive to IV fluid boluses, with SBP increasing from 70s to 80s/90s.
On [**10-23**] during hemodialysis the patient had an episode of chest pain, somewhat relieved with nitroglycerin, and an ECG concerning for anterior wall ischemia.
Additionally, the patient became extremely agitated in the cath lab, requiring endotracheal intubation.
He was managed on the ventilator overnight.
A right IJ central catheter was placed, but attempts to place a radial arterial line were unsuccessful.
He continued to be hypotensive overnight with SBP in 70s-80s, again responsive to IV fluid boluses.
