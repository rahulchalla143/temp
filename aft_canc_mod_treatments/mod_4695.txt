The patient tolerated the treatment well with some nausea and vomiting.
On day 4 of treatment she developed [**Last Name (un) **] with Cr 1.8, oliguria and metabolic acidosis that was repleted with IV bicarb gtt.
She was given 250cc IVF boluses x2 and started on dopamine 4mcg/kg/min to maintain SBP in the 90's.
The patient was having frequent PVC and one 9 run beat of V-tach and so was given an additional 250cc IVF bolus x3.
A second pressor, phenylephrine 1mcg/kg/min, was added to try and decrease her dopamine to reduce the number of PVC.
Additionally, blood cultures and 1g of vancomycin was hanging at the time of admission.
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, weight change, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, cough, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

[**2117-12-1**] 3:14 pm CATHETER TIP-IV      Source: TLCL.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Final Report REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of the patient after interleukin treatment due to renal cell cancer with hypotension.
Bibasal opacities are most likely representing part of this process.
Right central venous line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction.
CXR [**12-11**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the right PICC line is in unchanged position, but the left internal jugular vein catheter has been removed.
Regarding IL-2, treatment was stopped on [**2116-11-26**] due to lethargy and fatigue.
She required pressor support on night of transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
She was initially placed on dopamine that improved her pressures, however due to increasing ectopy Neo was added to try and decrease her dopamine.
Infectious work-up was unrevealing and antibiotics discontinued.
The carvedilol started in the ICU for CHF, was discontinued given continued hypotension.
Myocarditis treated with supportive care as unable to give to NSAIDS in setting of [**Last Name (un) **].
She was doing well on the [**Hospital1 **] until [**12-3**] when Code Blue was called whereupon the patient developed unstable VT (monomorphic with 1 short period of polymorphic), chest compressions were initiated, shock and 1 mg epinephrine then rhythm converted to VF, patient was re-shocked and regained pulse.
On arrival patient noted to be hypotensive and hypoxic - sterile femoral line was placed and patient was intubated and started on phenylephrine.
During peri-intubation period, the patient went in and out of unstable monomorphic VT and required 1 further shock.
Patient was given an IV Amiodarone bolus and started on an infusion with direction of cardiology.
She was aggressively diuresed while intubated and IV amiodarone infusion was continued at a low rate.
Patient was transitioned to PO amiodarone.
On the cardiology service, she was continued on Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] per loading.
She was discharged to continue Amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for 2 weeks, then 400mg daily for one week, and subsequently 200mg daily thereafter.
She was started on carvedilol in the ICU.
No further diuresis was initiated.
Beta blockade was not continued on discharge given hypotension.
She was instructed to follow-up further with her Oncologist for discussion of further management.
They recommended acute rehab for improved functional status.
She will follow-up with oncology as an outpatient for further management.
Metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to IL-2 treatment and associated diarrhea.
She has been given bicarb and has trended back to 22.
She was instructed not to continue this medication until further discussion with her PCP.
She was started on Ceftriaxone, and discharged on Cefpodoxime, to continue for 10 day course for complicated UTI.
