Suprapubic catheter change.
T9 CT guided biopsy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 96829**] is a 55 yo M w/long history of autonomic dysfunction complicated by urinary retention and suprapubic catheter placement who has multiple hospitalizations for recurrent UTI, most recently 2/[**2133**].
Of note, the pt's last UTI was positive for ESBL Klebsiella resistant to most abx except for meropenem/imipenem.
Pt was given one dose of meropenem and admitted to medicine.
In the ED, a WBC was 8.5, lactate 1.2, temp was 99.4   Past Medical History: - autonomic dysfunction c/b urinary retention requiring indwelling Foley catheter, with recurrent UTIs - CAD: s/p MI [**2107**], tx with angioplasty - diffuse interstitial pneumonitis - anemia - autoimmune hepatitis - autoimmune thyroiditis - autoimmune peripheral neuropathy - intradural t10 mass - s/p cholecystectomy - chronic pain - depression  Social History: Pt lived with wife and 30-year-old daughter prior to prolonged hospital/[**Hospital1 1501**] stay; disabled, but formerly a truck driver; uses wheelchair at home w/ bedside commode [**1-8**] autonomic dysfunction; Previosly smoked 1ppd x 20years, then quit for ~10 yr, restarted and now quit since [**10-12**]; no alcohol or IVDU.
SP catheter site with mild erythema, crusting.
Multiple calcified granulomas and calcified pleural plaques are better appreciated on prior CT examination.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are stable.
Tip of left-sided PICC catheter is unchanged in appearance within the brachiocephalic confluence.
CareWeb notes reveal the patient has a history of autoimmune hepatitis, thyroiditis, peripheral neuropathy, and autonomic dysfunction.
TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was performed without IV contrast.
There has been progression of the patient's interstitial lung disease with interlobular septal thickening and traction bronchiectasis, predominantly at the lung bases.

A bone island is seen within the right clavicle, slightly increased in size from [**2127-10-6**], however, unchanged from [**2132-9-26**].
FNA, lung, left lower lobe mass, cell block:  H&E stain shows alveolar spaces lined by atypical mucinous epithelium with intra-alveolar and background mucin, suspicious for a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, bronchioloalveolar type.
The family then decided to withdraw the ventilator which resulted in the rapid passing of the patient.
Other issues addressed during this hospitalization were recurrent UTI, autonomic neuropathy, initial diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer, anti-phospholipid syndrome, and bactermia.
