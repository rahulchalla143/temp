Brief Hospital Course: 34 vietnamese male with history of CML status post sibling-matched allo-bmt in [**2117**], with transplant course complicated by GVHD (skin, muscle) on rituximab, toxoplasmosis, CMV reactivation, who presented from clinic for fevers, hypotension, and continued headaches, found to have enterovirus meningitis.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient was treated  empirically for csf infection (ampicillin, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ayclovir), given IVF and stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone 100mg iv q8h).
On the floor he remained on prednisone 20 qam, 10mg qpm.
He remained hypotensive, so was continued on IVF (with occasional boluses) and started on fludrocortisone.
With fluids, prednisone and fludrocortisone the patient's blood pressure normalized.
He was started empirically on treatment for meningitis (amp, vanc, ctx and acyclovir) and in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] remained febrile, with continued diplopia and photophobia.
Based on this while cx were pending he continued treatment for meningitis.
His work-up (CMV viral load negative, Urine legionella negative, Blood culture negative, Stool culture, Lyme Ab negative, Cryptococcal Ag neg, CMV viral load neg, Toxoplasma IgG neg, Toxoplasma IgM pos and CSF cytology neg for malignant cells) remained negative, and while he was on the acyclovir, ceftriaxone, vancomycin and ampicillin for meningitis, he was also started on clindamycin, leucovorin and pyrimethamine for possible toxoplasma reactivation (given his past history of infection and neurologic symptoms).
At this point his ceftriaxone, ampicillin and vancomycin were stopped and the patient was given 4 days of IVIG (treatment for enterovirus).
When his enterovirus csf Pcr was positive, toxoplasma was unlikely so his treatment for this was stopped and he had a repeat MRI to rule out edema or worsening.
He was started on trial of ativan/diazepam which was not helping initially, as well as on meclizine which helped as well.
The best regimen for him which relieved his dizziness was meclizine 50mg [**Hospital1 **] and ativan 0.5mg tid.
He was continued on his home dose of cellcept, and given his low blood pressure was given stress dose steroids and then a decreased dose for daily therapy (20mg qam/10mg qpm).
The EP/cardiology team reviewed the patient's ECGs, which showed accelerated junctional rhythms and periods of low atrial tachycardia with AV dissociation.
He was started on heparin gtt.
Because of the interval improvement in the clot size, and given his fall risk with dizziness, heparin was discontinued prior to discharge.
Continued on prophylactic acyclovir, fluconazole, given one dose of pentamidine on [**10-21**] for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
He should receive this once a month, and his next dose should be no later than [**2121-11-20**].
Started on Celexa 20mg po qdaily, which he tolerated well with minimal side effects.
Started ritalin 10mg tid on the day of discharge given patient persistent letharghy and flat affect.
