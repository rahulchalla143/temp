Classical Whipple resection 2.
Open cholecystectomy 3.
When I first met him his parathyroid and pituitary issues were not yet under control and he required operations for these in the last few months.
His gastrin level has decreased on therapy but has not normalized.
I had a long discussion with [**Known firstname 3228**] and his wife about his disease process and the rationale for proceeding with an operative intervention at this point.
We discussed this fact in great depth and I told him that the burden of disease in the head of pancreas was significant and would likely require a Whipple's resection but that local excisional therapy may be possible instead.
Therefore we intended to do a Whipple's resection with potential for distal gland enucleation if technically feasible.
He was transitioned to oral pain medications once tolerating a diet.
On POD#6, JP amylase was measured from both JP drains (drain #1: 65; drain #2: 2241); both drains were kept in.
His abdomen was soft, nondistended and the incision with staples was C/D/I.
The staples were removed prior to discharge and steri strips placed.
Post-op Hyperglycemia: Postoperatively, the patient discontinued his metformin and was ordered for q4h fingersticks with insulin according to a sliding scale.
Calcium was repleted as necessary, and the patient was restarted on his calcitriol that was slowly increased during his hospital stay.
He was also started on calcium carbonate 1g TID.
By the time of his discharge, his corrected calcium was normalized on oral calcium.
