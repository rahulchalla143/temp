Now s/p lumbar drain placement on [**8-28**] with long complicated medical course including MICU stay and now stable for rehab s/p G-J placement for medication administration of HIV medications and nutrition.
Because of this, he had another lumbar drain placed and was transfered to MICU.
There was concern about his need for close nurse monitoring, his intractible nausea/vomiting, and his need for frequent potassium supplementation.
ID recomended starting acyclovir and vancomycin prophylaxis given staph epi positive cultures in CNS.
His abx treatment for meningitis was also modified to ambisome and flucoazole, while flucytizine was d/cd.
Initially a NG tube was placed but he self removed.
Pt previously admitted for cryptococcal meningitis in [**9-12**] and treated for 9 days with Ambisome and Flucytosine (14 days) followed by Fluconazole for >10 weeks.
On this admission the patient was seen by ID and was empirically started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and Ambisome to cover for bacterial meningitis, Listeria, HSV, and cryptococcus.
Flucytosine was held intially given the patient's ARF (worst Cr 1.9 on [**7-29**]).
ARF improved and switched to Flucytosine [**2163**] mg PO q8h and Ambisome 400 mg IV q24h - finished 2 week course for induction therapy.
However, administration of Flucytosine has proven to be difficult secondary to the patient's frequent emesis and overall poor toleration for PO intake.
Has been on Fluconazole 800mg IV daily rom [**Date range (1) 8610**] for consolidation phase and then switched to maintenance dose Fluconazole at 400 mg PO q24h for the next 4 weeks ([**9-10**] - [**10-7**]).
Patient on IV morphine and fentanyl patch for pain control.
#FEN: PICC line / In terms of nutrition, patient unable to take consistent PO due to nausea and vomiting from meningitis.
s/p Dobhoff placement [**2172-9-8**]; expelled [**2172-9-10**].
Fluids were given; TPN started at beginning of [**Month (only) 205**] until G-J tube placement by IR on [**2172-9-16**].
Per ID, vancomycin is reasonable for coverage of skin flora for procedure.
Prior to discharge, patient was able to tolerate tube feeds and administration of medications by G-J tube without problems.
Tube feeds at: Fibersource HN Full strength; Starting rate: 10 ml/hr; Advance rate by 10 ml q6h Goal rate: 75 ml/hr Residual Check: q4h Hold feeding for residual >= : 200 ml Flush w/ 150 ml water q6h .
Please recheck lytes and give IV fluids or increase hydration through TF to keep patient at baseline BUN low 20s and Cr 1.1-1.3. .
# s/p low grade temperature: Patient with low grade temp to max 100.3 on [**9-20**] overnight but temperature has decreased without treatment (at discharge has been ranging 98-99) with no overt signs of infection.
If patient with evidence of UTI, would start 4th generation cephalosporin to cover for pseudomonal coverage (has been colonized in past).
HAART was held until G-J tube placement on [**9-16**] when it was restarted by G-J tube as concern that inadequate absorption of medication would lead to resistance.
Patient was continued on bactrim and acyclovir prophylaxis by IV dosing while unable to administer PO medications.
Plan to continue HAART regimen: darunavir, truvada, enfuvirtide, raltegravir, ritonavir by G-J tube and prophylactic medications also by G-J tube.
