CT ([**2164-10-29**]): CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: Examination for comparative purposes is somewhat limited by the absence of IV contrast.
There are multiple areas of focal patchy infiltrates bilaterally including geographic paramediastinal consolidations (presumably patient had prior radiation therapy) that are unchanged.
There is interval increase in a massive left nephrectomy bed lesion that now measures 107 x 104 mm that is, allowing for absence of IV contrast, increased from approximately 95 x 92 mm.
The patient was started on  antibiotics in the emergency department.
The patient was maintained on levophed and fluids.
2) Respiratory distress: On HD 2 the patient developed significant respiratory distress with bilateral wheezes/rales.
She had only a minimal response in UO to lasix with a BP drop, and couldn't tolerate aggressive diuressis.
Given end-of-life discussions (see below), the patient was not intubated and was only supported with non-invasive means.
On HD3 she was tachypnic all morning and was supported with O2 by face mask (which she refused) and nasal canulla.
In the early afternoon her nurse found her not breathing; given her DNI/DNR status (see below) she was not intubated and passed away.
However, from her arrival in the ED the patient refused most treatment, including foley catheters and ECGs.
5) Coagulopathy: INR>2, up from baseline; no active bleeding but given PO vitamin K with resulting INR=1.5.
6) Prophylaxis: PPI, bowel regimen, heparin SC .
