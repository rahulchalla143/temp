[**MD Number(1) 3795**]  HISTORY  OF  THE  PRESENT  ILLNESS:    This  is a 54-year-old gentleman,  who  was  recently  discharged  on  the  13th  of [**Month (only) **]  to  rehabilitation  with multiple medical problems, including  coronary  artery disease, status post [**Female First Name (un) 899**] in [**2115**], congestive  heart  failure with EF of 20% to 30%, status post pericardial  stripping,  prostatic mitral and tricuspid valve placement   in   [**Month (only) 205**],   [**2123**]   for   valve  dysfunction  and constriction  after radiation; ICD placement for nonsustained VT  and  low  ER  inducible  VT.
He did have blood loss from the left  femoral  artery puncture site and required transfusion, bronchitic support, and blood loss anemia.
He was started on Dopamine.
Coronary artery disease, status post inferior myocardial infarction  [**2114**]  complicated  by  left ventricular thrombus, status post left circumflex stent in [**2123-4-1**].
Status post mitral valve and tricuspid valve prosthetic replacement [**2123-8-10**].
History of Hodgkin lymphoma at the age of 27, status post radiation and splenectomy.
Tracheostomy in [**2123-8-1**].
Gastrostomy tube placed in [**2123-8-1**].
medications and liquids.
Amiodarone 400 p.o.q.d.
Aspirin 325 p.o.q.d.
Lasix 20 mg p.o.q.d., 20 mg IV.
Levothyroxine 200 p.o.q.d.
Enoxaparin 40 subcutaneously b.i.d.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory revealed the hematocrit of 23.4; platelets  453,000,  white  blood  cell  count of 9.8 with no bands;  sodium  134;  potassium 5.2; chloride 99; bicarbonate 26;  BUN  123;  creatinine  1.5;  glucose  116;  calcium 7.5; magnesium  3.4; phosphorus 5.6; albumin 2.5; INR 1.3; PTT 32; arterial  blood  gas  on  90%  with  FIO2  with  5-cm of PEEP revealed the pO2 of 7.36, pCO2 of 49, pO2 of 56.
HOSPITAL  COURSE:    Mr. [**Known lastname **] was treated simultaneously for infectious pneumonic process, as well as congestive heart failure.
Dopamine  was  tried with limited success in conjunction with aggressive  bolus  Lasix  regimen.
Dopamine was discontinued and we started using a combination of afterload reduction and inotropic  support.
However,  he developed  a  rash  from  the  Imipenem and he was started on Bactrim.
He  had  been intermittently  tried on Dopamine, Dobutamine, and Lasix drip with  again  limited  success in terms of diuresis.
There was an episode  of  acute  renal  failure during the week of [**11-10**],  probably secondary to hypotension after failed attempt to  wean  Dopamine in conjunction with oncotic support in the form  of  packed  red  blood cells and Lasix.
He has been intermittently  using between 10 to 20-cm of pressure support in conjunction with 5-cm to 10-cm of PEEP and an FIO2 ranging between .4 and 1.
The Dopamine was eventually weaned to off on [**11-29**] and 21st  with  just  Dobutamine and Lasix.
A right subclavian was attempted, but failed.
Right internal jugular complicated  by  arterial  puncture  and a PICC line had been placed in the right arm, which is functioning at this point.
Over  the  week  of  [**11-12**] to [**11-19**], the patient was tried on trach-mask trials.
The  patient  was  placed back on pressor support ventilation and improved significantly in terms of his mental status.
He has been intermittently  tried on milrinone, Dopamine, and dobutamine.
The  patient  did not tolerate Milrinone  secondary  to  hypotension.
Maintaining the  patient  200 cc to 300 cc negative a day is a reasonable goal  on  a  moderate  dose  of Dobutamine at 6 mcg per k per minute using a Lasix drip at 5 to 20 mg an hour.
The INR was brought down to 1.9, at which time  Heparin  was  started.
As  the  patient improved, he started on Coumadin with a target INR of [**4-4**].
The patient was started on Bactrim.
Antibiotics were stopped on the 10th and  12th  of [**Month (only) 359**].
With  aggressive  diuresis  in  [**Month (only) 359**]  on Dobutamine  and  Lasix  the  oxygen requirements decreased to FIO2  of .41.
Ensuring a steady diuresis of 200-300 cc a day should  prevent  further oxygen requirements.
A  limit  to his diuresis may be reached in terms of the BUN, which has risen to the high 90s.
His Levothyroxine doses have been progressively increased.
The patient was received tube feeds  through  his  PEG, however, due to increased agitation and  abdominal distention in the absence of clear obstruction or  perforation, his tube feeds were stopped in favor or TPN.
The patient was controlled primarily with  Remeron and Ativan for sleep at night.
The mechanical ventilation was restarted  with  progressive  clearing  of his mental status.
