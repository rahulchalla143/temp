This likely happened because your platelets were very low due to your chemotherapy.
You had a surgical procedure to remove the blood and were started on steroids to decrease inflammation.
Please note the following medication changes: -Please DECREASE your Quinapril to 20mg daily -Please STOP taking neupogen unless instructed to start again by your outpatient doctors.
Take your pain medicine as prescribed if needed.
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.
DO NOT take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, or Ibuprofen etc.
If you were on a medication such as Coumadin (Warfarin), or Plavix (clopidogrel), or Aspirin prior to your injury, you may not safely resume taking this until follow up in one month.
You have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam) for anti-seizure medicine; you will not require blood work monitoring.
The prep with info for your diet the night before and morning of the test will be with your discharge papers.DIVISION OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE([**Telephone/Fax (1) 14344**]  [**2145-2-24**]  12:00p   [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]   SC [**Hospital Ward Name **] CLINICAL CTR, [**Location (un) **]   HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY-SC   Create Visit Summary [**2145-2-24**]  12:00p   BATTELLI,[**Last Name (un) 14345**]   SC [**Hospital Ward Name **] CLINICAL CTR, [**Location (un) **]   HEM/ONC FELLOWS  [**2145-2-24**]  12:00p   [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]   SC [**Hospital Ward Name **] CLINICAL CTR, [**Location (un) **]   HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY-SC   Create Visit Summary [**2145-2-24**]  12:00p   BATTELLI,[**Last Name (un) 14345**]   SC [**Hospital Ward Name **] CLINICAL CTR, [**Location (un) **]   HEM/ONC FELLOWS                                [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) 1041**] MD [**MD Number(2) 1709**]  Completed by:[**2145-2-17**
