PATHOLOGY: SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY: [**2145-12-17**] DIAGNOSIS: MARKEDLY HYPERCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH EXTENSIVE  INVOLVEMENT BY THE PATIENT'S PREVIOUSLY DIAGNOSED ACUTE MEGAKARYOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA (FAB M7).
He was treated with Decitibine starting on [**2145-12-23**].
Note: medication dosages were changed slightly after discharge to accomodate his needs for the ambulance ride- PO morphine dosage was increased to 10-20 mg PO q2hr PRN.
He was started on PO Vancomycin 250 every 6 hours.
He has also been on PO Flagyl 500 PO Q8 for this.
He was restarted on broad spectrum antibiotics, and worked up to rule out TB (past + PPD).
He was ruled out for TB and started on Voriconazole for presumed aspergillus.
On [**12-20**], he had return of his diarrhea in the setting of decreasing his PO vancomycin to 125 PO Q12.
He was restarted on PO Vanc 500mg Q6 and was tapered to 125 mg PO q6 hours for the remainder of his hospitalization with resolution of his sxs.
# Febrile neutropenia: Patient was placed on IV Vancomycin/Cefepime.
He remained afebrile, and after 14 days his IV antibiotics were discontinued.
On [**12-10**] he respiked a fever with possible sources being his abd and lung based on imaging studies.
He was restarted on vanc and cefepime.
He was eventually expanded over the course of a week to IV vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, and PO vancomycin and voriconazole.
He was on Acyclovir and pentamidine PPX.
It was initially thought that the fevers were in part due to recurrence but mycolytic blood cultures were positive for malessezia furfur (believed to be associated with TPN and his central line) and patient was treated with line removal and ambisome transiently (stopped secondary to fevers), and then voriconazole/posaconazole.
He was thus started on low-dose IV solumedrol 30 mg daily.
He also continued to have loose stools while on the PO Flagyl and vancomycin.
GI was consulted and wanted to do a c-scope to evaluate for GVHD of the gut, but held off because of his neutropenia.
He was kept on solumedrol througout his stay.
# RUL lung lesion - Patient has history of +PPD that has been treated with INH for 4 months which was discontinued because of liver toxicity.
He was without cough, but was worked up for fungal and bacterial causes (including induced sputum for TB).
He was ruled out for TB, and in the setting of a positive B-glucan he was thought to have a fungal pneumonia, which was treated with voriconazole.
