She was started on somatostatin and vasopressin, given 4 units of packed red blood cells and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma and transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**].
The patient began to have atrial fibrillation during this admission which was well rate controlled on her propanolol 10 mg p.o.
She was also found to have a right-sided lung mass of 5 cm, and bronchoalveolar lavage of this lung mass did show atypical cells consistent with non-small-cell lung cancer.
She had initially failed her swallow study in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and was placed on tube feeds.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Her medications prior to admission were a question of large nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use for her lower extremity pain.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  On transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was oxacillin 2 g q.8h., albuterol and Atrovent inhalers, heparin subcutaneous, morphine 2 mg as needed for pain, Protonix 40 mg intravenously q.12h., propanolol 10 mg per tube b.i.d., and an insulin sliding-scale with Glargine, Miconazole powder, Neutra-Phos 2 p.o.
b.i.d., calcium carbonate 1 g t.i.d., lactulose 30 mL q.4-6h.
as needed to make three bowel movements per day, Nystatin swish-and-swallow, Aldactone 100 mg q.d., vitamin C 500 mg b.i.d.
The patient was saturating at 95% on 2 liters via nasal cannula and had made less than 30 cc of urine over the past two hours.
PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on transfer revealed sodium was 140, potassium was 3.7, chloride was 104, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was 15, creatinine was 0.5, blood glucose was 159.
A chest x-ray on [**6-14**] showed the nasogastric tube placed post pylorically with a left lower lobe atelectasis.
Her past workup consisted of a workup for autoimmune hepatitis that showed a negative antinuclear antibody.
At that time, her nasogastric tube was removed and it showed some ulceration, so another nasogastric tube was not replaced.
She continued on her propanolol 10 mg p.o.
She was continued on her pantoprazole 40 mg intravenously q.12h., and her lactulose was increased from 30 mL as needed to 45 mL p.o.
Apparently, there was a question as to whether or not the patient will be eligible for any transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure to decrease her portal hypertension.
On [**6-18**], she was noted to have gained about three pounds of weight and had increased abdominal girth and had increased peripheral edema.
This was most likely due to her cirrhosis, and she was given some diuresis with Lasix with good results.
She was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells to draw some of the interstitial fluid into her intravascular space.
Her maintenance intravenous fluids were decreased as well.
She was saturating well on 1 liter to 2 liters of nasal cannula while on the Medicine Service.
She is currently being weaned off of her nasal cannula with saturations of 93% on room air.
She will receive one more day of her oxacillin dose on [**6-19**], and then her oxacillin should be discontinued.
The patient's nebulizer treatments were also made as needed.
The patient is being followed by the Orthopaedic Service for nonoperative care of her fractures, and her legs are currently placed in [**Doctor Last Name **] braces for stabilization.
It is considered that calcitonin might be added for pain control for this osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and fractures.
This improved throughout her hospitalization, and when she was transferred to the floor, she did respond to questioning and did not have fluctuations in her degree of consciousness and did not have asterixis.
On [**6-17**], this was the first day she began to be able to speak status post extubation, and this was barely a whisper and barely intelligible.
The patient may be suffering from delirium secondary to her medications such as morphine or maybe having increased encephalopathy secondary to cirrhosis, or maybe at a new baseline status post her prolonged illness and hospital course.
She has not had a biopsy at this time.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION:  The patient initially could not take orals because of a failed swallow study on [**6-14**].
She was started on tube feeds at that time which had been mostly held for the next two to three days because of planned esophagogastroduodenoscopy procedure.
After her esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**6-17**], her nasogastric tube was removed and not replaced.
The patient was started on intravenous fluids at that time for maintenance.
Most of her intravenous fluids end up being third-spaced.
She is more recently, with her continued lower urine output than input from intravenous fluids and oral intake, began to be having increased ascites and lower extremity edema.
It was at this time she was given Lasix with a good response, as she put out one liter after one 120-mg intravenous treatment with Lasix.
She was also given a packed red blood cell transfusion to keep her fluid intravascularly and give her more osmolar pull.
She can be continued on Lasix 20 mg b.i.d.
With her lower extremity edema, she was evaluated for deep venous thrombosis; and lower extremity Doppler tests were found to be negative.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient's diabetes and blood sugars have been well controlled on Glargine long-term and an insulin sliding-scale.
PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient is on subcutaneous heparin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, proton pump inhibitor for ulcer, and variceal prophylaxis.
