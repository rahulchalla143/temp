ascending and sigmoid) and angioectasias in proximal and decending colon tx by ARMS.
The patient became acutely confused and the prednisone was discontinued and pt started on colchicine and NSAIDS for the gout.
On the floor, the patient received a push enteroscopy and small bowel follow through which were also unable to localize a lesion.
Pt was transferred to the MICU urgently and recieved an EGD showing angioectasias in the stomach body and second part of duodenum.
The patient received 2units of PRBCs and remained hemodynamically stable over night.
She was subsequently transferred back to the floor where she later recieved a push enteroscopy.
She was continued on PPIs, the ASA and NSAIDS were all held and monitored with serial Hcts which remained stable.
COPD:  This pt has known, longstanding COPD on 4L NC at home with C-PAP at night.
She was continued on nebulizer treatment with NC oxygen titrated to mid 90s.
The prednisone was given for acute episodes of gout not for her COPD exacerbation.
She received several units of PRBC and her Creatinine returned to baseline.
The ARF was presumed to be secondary to aggressive diuresis or s/p steroids and NSAIDS tx.
CHF: pt admitted with complaints of fatigue, SOB, orthopnea with bilateral crackls, significant bilateral lower extremity edema and CXR consistent with CHF.
Pt was started on 1.5L fluid restriction and salt restriction, as well as aggressive diurese with lasix IV with goal of negatie 1.5-2L negative.
Pt successfully reached target diuresis for 4 consecutive days, however this lead to the development of contraction alkalosis.
Acetazolamide was added to her lasix regimen and her serum bicarb normalized and the alkalosis resolved.
The patient reached euvolemia on HD #7.
She was maintained on her outpatient dose of allopurinol on admission, however a gout flare occured on hospital day #3.
She was evaluated by rheumatology consult and initially treated with prednisone which was complicated by an acute confusional state.
The prednisone was discontinued and she was started on NSAIDS and colchicine.
Due to guaiac positive black tarry diarrhea, the colchicine and NSAIDS were discontinued (see GI bleed).
The patient responded to the prednisone, colchicine and NSAIDS with resolution of her gout flare.
Once the ARF resolved, the patient was started back on her outpatient allopurinol dose of 150mg once daily.
This was treated with solumedrol 20mg IV x1 with good results.
She was subsequently placed on a prednisone taper of 15mg PO x2, 10mg PO x2, 5mg PO x2 then off.
She tolerated the prednisone well and the gout flare resolved.
She was discharged on a prednisone taper (30mg on day of discharge, 15mg PO once daily for two days, 10mg PO once daily for two days, 5mg PO once daily and then stop prednisone) with intentions to increase the allopurinol to 200mg after 4 weeks time.
This is most likely multifactorial in etiology with contributions from prednisone (started on [**2139-2-18**] for gout) + contraction alkalosis with compensatory respiratory acidosis due to extensive lasix diuresis + COPD causing worsening hypercarbia and hypoxia + ?PNA (pt with new cough, fever, and ?CXR) + abx (pt was on levofloxacin at the time) + GI bleed.
The prednisone was discontinued, levofloxacin was changed back Bactrim (see below in UTI section), acetazolamide was added to treat the contraction alkalosis, the patient was placed back on c-pap and ambien was discontinued.
Prednisone was added to an allergy under POE.
On admission, the patient was found to have a positive UA positive for which she was treated with Bactrim/Levofloxacin for a combination of [**7-23**] days.
She was initially started on batrim but was changed to leveofloxacin on day 3 when she presented with leukocytosis.
The antibiotic was changed back to Bactrim when susceptibilities demonstrated the UTI was sensitive to Bactrim.
After her brief MICU stay for Upper GI bleed, her SBP was in the 100s off antihypertensives.
The patient was given several units of PRBCs for continuing GI bleed and her BP returned to [**Location 213**]/Hypertensive levels.
She was initially started on metoprolol due to ARF, but was placed back on Valsartan and the metoprolol was d/c'd as renal function returned to [**Location 213**].
Valsartan dose was decreased from outpatient regimen of 160 mg once daily to 120mg once daily given transient low SBP.
