Status post myocardial infarction in [**2134**], status post percutaneous transluminal angiography in [**2160**] to left anterior descending artery and diagonal I.
Insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Captopril 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], atenolol 50 q day, isosorbide dinitrate 20 [**Hospital1 **], Senna [**Hospital1 **], Betoptic one drop OD [**Hospital1 **], Humulin N 30 units q am and 5 units q pm.
Allergies to aspirin which causes bleeding.
There is a faded right perimedial incision scar and a right lateral hernia without hepatosplenomegaly.
Admit laboratories:  ALT 25, AST 10, alkaline phosphatase 113, amylase 51, lipase 49, total bilirubin 0.3, uric acid 5.9.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room and underwent exploratory laparotomy and ileocolectomy at the ileocolonic anastomosis as well as a small bowel resection.
Postoperatively, the patient had a nasogastric tube with a pO2 of 73.
His hypertension which was controlled with Nipride, plan was to take his nasogastric tube out the following morning.
Postoperative, the patient's temperature is 95 po, his heart rate was 50-60, blood pressure 187/70, respirations 15 and again he was given IV Lopressor, nitropaste.
He was continued on his captopril and isosorbide and plan was to begin a nitroglycerin drip if his systolic blood pressure increased over 150.
Respiratory he was diuresed with Lasix and supplemental oxygen was continued.
He was on perioperative antibiotics at this time.
Postoperative day one, the patient was continued on Lopressor, Captopril, and Isordil for blood pressure control.
He is still on IV fluids, no feedings.
He was also given prn Lasix for diuresis.
He had faint rales on examination with rhonchi throughout.
Plan was to check laboratories, give Lasix IV, and Lopressor for rate control to rule out for myocardial infarction, given pulmonary toilet, and contact Cardiology for consultation.
Cardiology saw the patient and recommendations were to cycle cardiac enzymes to rule out ischemia and to recommend aspirin from a cardiac perspective, to proceed with diuresis to control heart rate and blood pressure with beta blocker and ACE, nitroglycerin, and Morphine.
My recommendation is to continue aspirin, to increase beta blocker for rate control.
Check his echocardiogram to evaluate for systolic function, diurese to goal of [**11-21**] liters negative for the day, follow CKs.
He was placed on mechanical ventilation and a PA catheter was also placed to guide fluid therapy as well as pressors if needed.
Echocardiogram obtained today showed an ejection fraction of 40%, 2+ mitral regurgitation, and anteroseptal hyperkinesis.
At that time, his picture appeared to be consistent with sepsis in the setting of perioperative ischemia, and plan was to start Levophed to support blood pressure, to begin Heparin drip, to broaden his antibiotic coverage to attempt further diuresis.
He is placed on amp of levo and Flagyl.
He did begin to respond to a Lasix boluses and was finally put on a Lasix drip for which he diuresed well.
Pressors were able to be weaned, however, the patient did at one point require Dobutamine for support as his Levophed was weaned off.
Additionally, his dobutamine was weaned to off.
He had been restarted on trophic tube feeds and showed some bowel activity with a small bowel movement.
Patient did not show any signs of regaining his mental status, however, after extubation, this is felt possibly due to prolonged sedative effect as he had been given Ativan earlier in his hospital course.
Patient's nutrition while he was intubated was supported with TPN, and this could also have effected his blood-nitrogen levels.
His Lasix drip was able to be stopped and the patient continued to make urine well on his own over the last couple of days.
His tube feeds were kept the same and his TPN was stopped yesterday.
He continued to require supplemental oxygen which the requirements have increased overnight.
Ileocolectomy and small bowel resection.
PA catheter placement.
Arterial catheter placement.
