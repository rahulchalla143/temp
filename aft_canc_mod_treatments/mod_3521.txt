Admission Date: [**2116-7-15**]        Discharge Date: [**2116-7-15**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  M  Service:   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74 year old male with a history of CLL diagnosed five years ago, status post fludarabine times one year complicated by AIHA, then switched to chlorambucil plus prednisone with the former discontinued secondary to decreasing platelets in [**2116-6-13**].
The patient presented to [**Hospital6 8283**] emergency room on Wednesday with complaints of nausea and vomiting times one and diarrhea times three.
In the emergency room he was given intravenous fluids, Solu-Medrol 200 mg IV, suspecting ITP versus leukemic transformation and levofloxacin.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] emergency room via ambulance for further management.
In the emergency room he had bright red blood per rectum times two and significant hematuria complicated by clot retention and difficult Foley placement necessitating urology consult.
A 14 French coude was placed.
He was given one unit of packed red blood cells and a six pack of platelets as well as IVIG for presumed ITP and transferred to the Fennard ICU.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Prednisone 4 mg p.o.
q.d., acyclovir 400 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Lipitor, aspirin, Hytrin, Protonix 40 mg p.o.
q.d., folate 3 mg p.o.
Early differential diagnosis for thrombocytopenia included medication or chemo effect, ITP, TTP, HUS, sequestration or viral infection.
The patient was initially given IVIG 1 gm per kg and was maintained on Solu-Medrol 200 mg q.d.
He was given a four day course of Decadron 40 mg q.d.
The patient was treated with Rituxan and also with vincristine.
The patient was seen in consultation by surgery for the possibility of splenectomy, but at the time of dictation splenectomy is low on the list of possibilities, given the lack of response to IVIG, steroids and the surgical risks, given his platelet count.
Once the Foley was changed and the counts were kept at a level above 50, the hematuria resolved and at the time of dictation he has had clear urine without red blood cells for five days.
The patient was treated with Rituxan once and the plan is to continue to treat him weekly during his hospitalization.
The patient was placed on an insulin sliding scale while receiving high dose steroids.
Once his platelet count returns to normal, he can be restarted on this medication.
Further dictation of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course as well as discharge status, discharge condition, discharge medications and followup will be dictated by the next intern taking over the service.
