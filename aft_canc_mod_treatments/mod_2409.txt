He was planned for systemic chemotherapy (gemcitabine/cisplatin).
The MRI again demonstrated the enlarged 2.1-cm gastrosplenic lymph node, concerning for metastasis as well as a 11-mm subcu nodule within the anterior abdominal wall along the previously placed left biliary catheter which may represent scar tissue or metastasis.
He was planned to be directly admitted to the West 1 Surgical Service (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for PTC, brushings and biopsy.
Past Medical History: pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy on [**2187-5-3**] for a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the ampulla benign prostatic hypertrophy, schistosomiasis, Past surgical hx: pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy and cholecystectomy [**2194-9-12**] L biliary duct dilation and stent placement  Social History: He has an occasional social alcoholic beverage.
Severe atrophy of the right hepatic lobe with severe biliary dilation and right metallic hepatic biliary stent in place.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] returned to oncology clinic (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1852**] on [**2195-3-12**] in anticipation of beginning systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine/cisplatin.
IV Vanco/Zosyn was emperically started.
On [**2195-3-16**], patient was given FFPs for INR 1.8 and underwent PTC with placement of R anterior, posterior and L biliary drains.
He was briefly weaned off Levophed on the next day, however, his bilirubin continued to increase and patient returned to IR for cholangiogram, which showed hemobilia and obstruction of the drains that was resolved with aspiration/flushing.
His drains continued to put out ~200-250ml of bilious material.
What follows is a summary of this patient's complicated SICU course:  [**3-17**]: lactate trending down, weaning levophed, weaning vent, switch to D5W [**3-18**]: Rec'd 25g albumin, weaned off pressors, biliary drains checked & cleared of clots by IR [**3-19**]: 1 U PRBC's, start TPN [**3-20**] :started on 25g albumin q8h,continued advancing TPN,laxix 10mgiv, us liver shows patent vessels, cx swann to triple lumen; failed decreasing PEEP fto 8 (desatted) & failed decreasing PS to 8 (desatted) [**3-21**]: R PTC began pouring out serosanguinous fluid, hct stable, thought to be pleural effusion through sidehole.
Pt went to IR for removal of R drains, replacement of L drain and placement of R pleural pigtail catheter.
[**3-22**]: persisting abd distension, bladder pressure 14-15; pleural fluid cultured, start TPN w/ lipids on [**3-23**], pigtail to suction [**3-23**]: Biliary fluid from ET - F/U serum and sputum Tbili.
Added Flagyl for c. perfringens in bile, d/c'd zosyn & started meropenem.
Episode of hypotension: 1x albumin 12.5 g. Started NICOM.
[**3-24**]: Increased sedation to help with vent compliance as changed over to pressure control ventilation.
Required increasing pressors due to propofol.
Started cisatricurium drip to improve vent synchrony and decreased sedation.
[**3-25**]: d/c'd flagyl (adequate anaerobic coverage w/ [**Last Name (un) 2830**]).
Cisatrocurum stopped and propofol increased slightly to 50.
[**3-28**]: episode of hypotension when levophed decreased 0.09; increased, then BP stablized at 0.1; hyperK - tx w/ insulin/glucose x2 and bicarb; renal to eval for CVVH - per their recs, can start when hyperK worsens; no ST changes [**3-29**]: K 6.3 - more ins/glucose, HCO3; albumin 12.5g TID, lasix 40mg x1=400 urine above baseline but pt also turned in am so actually decreased in pO2 & cxr, creatinine bump to 2.1; repeat dose lasix yielded another 440 urine above baseline.
Added albuterol MDI q6h prn.
IV lasix 40mg IV twice today.
Pt has withdrawl to pain response now that propofol off for 18 hours.
[**4-3**]: Went to IR for drain study, drain patent.
[**4-4**]: s/p open trach.
[**4-8**]: Successful endoscopic advancement of NJ tube-->tube feeds started [**4-9**]: increasing TF 10cc q8h to a goal of 65 mL/hr.
[**4-10**]: fluids to 50cc/hr NS per transplant [**4-11**]: chest tube replacement cc:cc w/ 1/2NS [**4-12**]: CT output replacement held o/n for + fluid balance [**4-13**]: RUQ US shows mild-mod right but not left biliary dilatation.
Overnight insulin given for hyperkalemia.
3amps bicarb; bili/amylase/cytology for pleural fluid sent [**4-15**]: GPCs in blood cx from RIJ, R SC TLC placed; D10 @ 20ml/hr for hypoglycemia; 1:1 fluid replacement for increased CT output which then decreased over the day, sputum cx for green sputum.
Bicarb decreasing, so given 1 amp bicarb.
[**4-17**]: tolerating trach collar, still on 0.03 levophed, d/c D10, ordered flexiseal, TFs to goal at 35ml/hr; started NaHCO3 in NS @ 75ml/hr; decreasing UOP - gave 500ml NS, increasing Cr 3.3 [**4-18**]: 1 amp bicarb [**4-19**]: Gave 2 amps bicarb.
Recs include urine lytes, osms, sediment; salt poor albumin with lasix to decrease K if needed.
Started cipro for PTC prophylaxis and dosed vancomycin.
renal reconsulted:no HD indicated [**4-21**]: recomendation to consider palliative care consult, TPN d/ced [**4-22**]: Renal agrees HD is not indicated, albumin given x 3, 2 amps bicarb for level of 14, put back on vent.
Restarted levo and placed R radial Aline.
[**4-25**]: Removed Aline and d/c'd abx.
started morphine gtt for agonal breathing.
Medications on Admission: Creon [**12-21**] capsule PO TID w/ meals & snacks, Omeprazole 20mg PO daily Ondansetron 8mg  prn nausea Prochloroperazine maleate 10 mg Q6H prn nausea Ursodiol 300mg PO BID Calcium MVI 1 tab po daily Omega-3-FA's   Discharge Medications: None, pt expired.
