Cardiac Catherization with stent placement.
History of Present Illness:    This is an 87 year-old male with history of 3 vessel coronary disease, congestive heart failure, aortic stenosis, diabetes, end-stage renal disease not on dialysis who presents with ST elevation infarction.
He was recently admitted with unstable angina and was discharged 2 days prior to this presentation.
Given prior plans for medical management, he received aspirin, sublinqual nitro x 3, Plavix 600 mg, heparin srip, lopressor, morphine and ativan.
After discussions with his outpatient nephrologist, covering cardiologist, and daughters, he was taken emergently to the catherization lab for a diagnostic and potentially therapeutic catherization despite the risk of needing dialysis after the [**Month/Year (2) **] load.
He was started on pressors for cardiogenic shock.
A stent was placed to the proximal LAD.
Coronary artery disease status post an MI [**47**] years ago.
A decision was made then not to pursue bypass surgery.
Status post ressection of the sigmoid colon and rectum for colon cancer.
Physical Exam: Vitals: Temperature: Blood Pressure: Pulse: Respiratory Rate: Oxygen Saturation: General: Intubated and sedatied.
Swan-ganz catheter in placed at the right groin.
Balloon pump in placed at the left groin.
Right sided leads had ST elevations in V4R.
Catherization [**2124-4-21**]: His right coronary was totally occluded.
Intervention: A drug eluting stent was placed to the left main and proximal LAD with good resultant flow.
A intraaortic balloon pump was placed.
Speech and Swallow Assessment [**2124-5-4**]: Moderate delay in laryngeal valve closure with associated aspiration and penetration as described above.
PICC line placement [**2124-5-8**]:  Successful placement of a single lumen PICC line into the right brachial vein with the tip in the SVC.
He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with complaints of chest pain and found to have significant CAD based on a Persantine MIBI test, however a cardiac catheterization could not be performed given the severe acute on chronic renal failure.
However, this hospitalization for STEMI was complicated by episodes of shock and hypoxic respiratory distress requiring intubation/extubation after which point the patient was made DNR/DNI.
He was subsequently transitioned off medical therapy and instead started on a morphine drip through a pre-existing PICC line for comfort measures.
If needed, the pt should also receive a Scopolamine patch.
At the time of catherization, CT surgery felt that he was not a surgical candidate given his multiple comorbidities.
When he was weaned from pressors, he was started on a beta-blocker.
He required intubation prior to his catherization.
He was maintained on the ventilator while he was on pressors for shock.
He received Lasix and metolazone.
On [**5-5**] he developed respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary edema and likely aspiration pneumonia, which was treated with triple antibiotics.
Mental status waxed and waned but was generally declining and urine output poor in setting of aggressive diuresis.
A balloon pump was placed at the time of catheterization and he was continued on dopamine.
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed for hemodynamic monitoring.
He did not respond to a cortisol stimulation test and was started on stress dose steroids.
He was started empirically of vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for a presumed aspiration pneumonia and completed a 10 day course.
Over the next few days, he became afebrile, his white count trended down, and he was weaned from all pressors.
The Swan-Ganz catheter was subsequently removed.
He was loaded with IV amiodarone.
He was transitioned to oral amiodarone and received 2 days of 400 [**Hospital1 **] followed by 400 daily which at this point will be continued indefinitely.
Amiodarone was discontinued prior to discharge when decision was made to transition to comfort care.
He initially had a balloon pump for support.
In the setting of septic shock, he became total body fluid overloaded and required diuresis with Lasix.
He will be discharged on furosemide 60 mg po qd and with morphine for symptomatic control of dyspnea.
As he was weaned off of the pressors and as his blood pressure improved, his urine output increased with a subsequent decrease in his creatinine.
He received an aggressive bowel regimen.
He was decompressed with an NG tube to low suction and rectal tube.
Once he was off of fentanyl sedation, his bowel sounds improved and he began to move his bowels.
He was maintained on bisacodyl suppositories.
At that time, he was maintained on an insulin sliding scale.
Prophylaxis: He was maintained on subcutaneous heparin.
He was on a bowel regimen as above.
He was maintained on pantoprazole.
Access: He initially had a Swan-Ganz through his right femoral vein.
A radial arterial line was placed when the balloon pump was removed.
Once he was stable off of pressors, the swan and the central line were removed.
He will be discharged with PICC line to facilitate morphine administration.
FEN: He was started on tube feeds on hospital day 3 as he was still intubated.
He was maintained on tube feeds.
After recovering from this, he was maintained on cautious PO diet.
Per family request, he was allowed to have thin liquids as well.
