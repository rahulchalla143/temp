Brief Hospital Course: 87 yo M HTN, DM, CAD, HL, heavy tobacco abuse, recently diagnosed primary squamous cell of the lung that presented to ER with chest pain and was found to have three vessel disease on cath, PCI with two bare metal stents.
# NSTEMI Chest pain started initially while undergoing his first round of chemotherapy with carboplatin/taxol.
Given his poor operative candicacy, he underwent successful PCI to distal left main and ostial LAD stenosis with bare metal stents.
He was loaded with plavix, and started on aspirin rather than aggrenox.
Atenolol was switched to metoprolol and simvastatin to atorvastatin 80mg.
Heparin and nitro drips were continued post-cath due to ongoing chest pain.
His chest pain resolved with 24 hours and the nitro drip was stopped.
Heparin was continued due to history suggestive of a PE, and was stopped after this was ruled out.
He was initially treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin but this was stopped given lack of fever and WBC.
He was continued on the heparin drip after cath for concern of possible PE.
Heparin drip was initially continued due to concern of compression of pulmonic artery, but was then stopped prior to discharge.
He began chemotherapy but developed chest pain.
Placed on insulin sliding scale.
# Benign prostatic hypertrophy with obstruction A foley was placed earlier in [**Month (only) 958**] due to obstruction after lung biopsy was performed.
He has continued to have the foley since then.
A foley was replaced when he was unable to urinate and he was discharged with plan to followup with urology.
