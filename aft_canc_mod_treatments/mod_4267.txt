He has been worked up over the past 2 weeks for anemia and iron deficiency.
On [**11-9**], He complained of dizziness, abdominal cramps and wine-coloured stools.
Unfortunately, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 67432**] had left to travel abroad today so he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for small bowel enteroscopy with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].

Possible causes of bleed include peptic ulcer disease and NSAID-induced gastritis from aspirin use, radiation enteritis from treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (although he was treated in [**2164**]), recurrent lymphoma and arteriovenous malformations.
He was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs on admission and underwent enteroscopy on [**11-13**].
Enteroscopy did not reveal source of bleed (just showed nodular stomach from old XRT) and bleeding was thought to be due to an ateriorvenous malformation that had blanched out.
He was instructed to take 81mg of aspirin instead of 325mg due to bleeding risk.
Aspirin and home anti-hypertensive regimen were held on admission due to GI bleed and close monitoring of hemodynamic instability.
Patient's hematocrit was carefully followed and he did not require any further blood transfusions.
HYPERTENSION- Diltiazema and Toprol XL were held to active GI bleeding in order to better characterize volume loss and reciprocal tachycardia in response to hypotension.

You were admitted to the ICU for GI bleeding and had an enteroscopy to try to figure out the source of bleeding.
We initially held your blood pressure medications because of GI bleeding.
Your medications have not changed, but please ask your GI doctors *(and cardiologist) whether to take 325mg or 81mg of aspirin.
(we held them initially as we often do for GI bleeds)  Please continue to take your other medications as you have been.
