History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname 77072**] is a 69 year old woman with advanced ovarian cancer who underwent debulking surgery today.
This ultimately involved a total colectomy with end ileostomy; R oopherectomy; placement of a G-J tube; and a cholecystectomy.
The uterus and ovaries could not be removed because of tumor encasing the uterus, ovaries, and bladder; there was large omental caking; and thus, significant amounts of tumor had to be left in the abdomen.
There were no major complications of the surgery, but given the extent of the surgery and the possibility of post-operative difficulties, the ob/gyn and general surgery services (both working on the case) agreed that she would be best cared for in an intensive care unit tonight.
After consultation with a gynecological oncology specialist she elected to proceed with the surgery undertaken today.
She is complaining of pain in the lower abdomen as well as her chronic lower back pain (for which she uses a fentanyl patch as an outpatient).

# Intraoperative course:  On [**2193-12-7**] the pt underwent exam under anesthesia, exploratory laparotomy, right salpingo-oophorectomy, and drainage of 4 liters ascites by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2028**].
This was followed by lysis of adhesions, abdominal colectomy, end ileostomy with Hartmann's pouch of rectum, gastrojejunostomy feeding tube, and open cholecystectomy by Dr [**First Name (STitle) 2819**].
She developed hypotension intraoperatively and was transfused 2 units of packed RBCs.
Intraoperative findings were significant for studding of all peritoneal surfaces, a solid cake of tumor from the top of the bladder back to the sacral promontory with indistinct tissue plains, tumor infiltration into retroperitoneal spaces, tumor compression of ileocecal portion of the bowel, complete replacement of the infracolic omentum with 15 cm tumor, tumor extension along the infragastric omentum and lesser sac, studding of diaphragmatic surfaces bilaterally.
Cardiovascular: Pt developed fluid responsive hypotension on POD#0, due to post-operative fluid shifts and medication effects of the epidural.
Blood pressure rose to normal levels within the ICU admission; fluid boluses were used to maintain pressure and hydration during the post-operative course.
As pt's blood pressure reached high normal, her outpatient medication regimen of amlodipine and lisinopril were restarted.
GU:  The pt had borderline urine output on POD#0 that resolved with IV fluid hydration.
Her foley was discontinued on POD#6.
This was thought to be a combination of timely ambulation and discontinuation of her home imipramine per psych recommendations.
Heme:  The pt received 2 units of packed RBCs intraoperatively.
She remained asymptomatic from her anemia for the duration of her hospitalization and her Hct was stable 22-24. .
Neuro: Post-operative pain was initially managed with an epidural, but the epidural fell out and a fentanyl PCA was started for control of pain.
She was transitioned to dilaudid pca, then dilaudid po with adequate pain control.
Fentanyl Patch 50 mcg/hr TP Q72H was continued throughout hospitalization.
Continued zofran and prochlorperazine initially; however, discontinued the latter with delirium (below).
Surgery recommended 4 days ceftazidime and flagyl for ppx against intrabdominal infection.
Pt was not restarted on further antibiotics.
These temperatures were attributed to atelectasis and insentive spirometry and ambulation were encouraged.
We continued her home mirtazapine and sertraline.
Confusion resolved and pt was restarted on home ativan dose without recurrance of symptoms.
Continue home timolol for glaucoma.
Tube feeds through the GJ tube were started on [**12-20**] and advanced to 60cc/hr for 10 hrs a day.
However, calorie counts remained inadequate and pt was discharged with tube feeds.
