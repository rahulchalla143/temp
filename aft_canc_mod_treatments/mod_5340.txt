All medications as prescribed.
You will be on coumadin for the rest of your life given that this is your second episode of blood clots.
We have contact[**Name (NI) **] your primary care doctor, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1743**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and her office will be managing your coumadin dosing.
You will need to get frequent labs (up to a few times per week initally and then eventually once or twice a month) to monitor your "INR" level which shows how effective the coumadin is.
This medication can effect the INR and the effect of the coumadin and thus you need very close monitoring in the next few weeks.
Coumadin helps prevent new clots and helps prevent the old clots from becoming bigger.
Other medications can effect the level and make you more likely to bleed and therefore before any starting new medication, let your doctors know [**Name5 (PTitle) **] are on coumadin.
Otherwise, take all medications as you were previously before coming into the hospital; your lasix and spirinolactone were adjusted down (see med list below).
