Admission Date:  [**2199-5-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-5-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2120-1-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**] Chief Complaint: Unresponsiveness and left-sided weakness   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PEG tube insertion [**2199-5-17**]   History of Present Illness: 79RHF with paroxysmal atrial flutter/AF previously well controlled on sotalol and on dabigatran for anticoagulation, CAD, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, diastolic CHF, HTN, HLD, CKD presents with unresponsiveness and left-sided weakness.
EMS were called and she was noted to be in fast Aflutter in 150s and in the ambulance they administered IV diltiazem which brought her HR to the low 100s.
BP was stable throughout and on arrival at the [**Hospital1 18**] ED BP was 120s-130s/70s and she had been incontinent of stool.

Cefazolin interpretative criteria are based on a dosage regimen of          2g every 8h.
Radiology: [**2199-5-5**] CTA head and neck: FINDINGS: New hypodensity in the right parietotemporal and occiptal lobes, extending into the right basal ganglia and internal capsule, is consistent with an acute right MCA and PCA territory infarct.
There is complete opacification of bilateral maxillary sinuses and partial opacification of bilateral anterior ethmoid/frontal sinuses.
Moderate atherosclerotic calcification is seen in the cavernous portion of both internal carotid arteries.
[**2199-5-6**] Portable NCHCT: IMPRESSION: Large right middle cerebral and posterior cerebral arterial territory infarction overall unchanged in appearance compared to the most recent prior study performed five hours earlier with mass effect on the right lateral ventricle but no evidence of midline shift, hemorrhagic transformation, or herniation at this time.
A nasogastric tube is seen with its tip in the stomach.
NG tube tip is in the stomach.
Brief Hospital Course: 79RHF with paroxysmal atrial flutter/AF previously well controlled on sotalol and on dabigatran for anticoagulation, CAD, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, diastolic CHF, HTN, HLD, CKD presented on [**2199-5-5**] with unresponsiveness and left-sided weakness and found to have a severe right MCA/PCA syndrome on examination.
She was admitted to the ICU and dabigatran and other anticoagulation was held due to concern for hemorrhagic conversion and she was treated with aspirin alone initially.
She had persistently poor swallow assessments and aspirated on all consistencies and a Dobbhoff tube was placed.
Eventually hr heart rate was controlled on a combination of diltiazem and metoprolol.
She was transferred to the floor and there, she was also noted to have intermittent prolonged apneic spells which were felt to likely represent OSA and given her NG tube she could not have CPAP.
She was treated for a UTI and then started spiking fevers which were attributed to likely aspiration pneumonia/HCAP although little to find on CXR or other infectious workup, ID were [**Year (4 digits) 4221**] and eventually signed off and she completed an 8 day course of IV vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam and fevers settled.
Following her PEG insertion, she was restarted on anticoagulation with warfarin with an overlap of aspirin until therapeutic INR.
She was noted to have a Hb drop from 9 to 6.8 in the setting of an inadequate reticulocyte count and although stool was minimally guaiac positive, this was not enough to explain this loss and after hematology, GI and general surgery consults, this was felt to represent her MDS and required 2 units of RBCs.
# Neurology: Patient has had no prior stroke but has considerable stroke risk factors of paroxysmal atrial flutter/AF previously well controlled on sotalol but taking an inadequate dose of dabigatran, CAD, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, diastolic CHF, HTN, HLD.
Limb exam revealed a dense left hemiparesis with slight withdrawal in LUE and toe extension and knee flexion on LE and good spontaneous movement on right, grimaces to noxious throughout, brisker reflexes on right and right extensor plantar.
This revealed multiple episodes of RVR requiring PRN diltiazem, metoprolol and at times requiring IV medications.
Patient was treated with a HISS with a goal for normoglycemia.
Stroke risk factors were assessed with HbA1c 6.0% and FLP revealed Chol 141 TGCs 180 HDL 26 LDL 79.
Simvastatin was changed to atorvastatin 20mg qd.
She was admitted to the ICU and dabigatran and other anticoagulation was held due to concern for hemorrhagic conversion and she was treated with aspirin alone initially.
Ideally, she required anticoagulation but due to the large infarct, this was felt to be too great a risk for considerable hemorrhagic conversion and was deferred until after PEG placement.
She was seen by S&S and found to have significant dysphagia, she was therefore made NPO and a Dobbhoff tube was inserted.
In the ICU she had episodes of RVR and she was initially treated with IV diltiazem.
She had continued RVR and diltiazem much improved HR but BP was borderline hypotensive and metoprolol was tapered and uptitrated diltiazem and eventually BP improved and rate was well controlled on the last 3 days of her hospitalisation.
General surgery were [**Year (4 digits) 4221**] regarding possible PEG placement given continued severe dysphagia but wanted to defer surgery until fevers settled.
Following her PEG insertion, she was restarted on anticoagulation with warfarin (dabigatran cannot be crushed) on [**2199-5-19**] with an overlap of aspirin until INR is therapeutic.
We held darbepoetin due to possible increased stroke risk and this should be re-addressed by hematology at her soon o/p appointment.
# CVS: Patient has a history of AF/AFlutter diagnosed in [**2194**] s/p a failed cardioversion in [**2195**], HTN, HLD and single vessel CAD who presented with embolic right MCA/PCA stroke as above likely due to cardioembolism from her AF in the setting of inadequate anticoagulation as the patient has been taking her dabigatran only once daily.
Dabigatran and other anticoagulation was held due to concern for hemorrhagic conversion and she was treated with aspirin alone initially.
Patient had been well controlled rate-wise in the community on sotalol and diltiazem XR 240mg qd.
Her rate control and anti-hypertensive agents were initially held and during her hospitalisation, she had several episodes of RVR requiring IV rate control agents (diltiazem and metoprolol) and her diltiazem was uptitrated.
Whilst in the ICU, the patient had [**1-7**] second pauses on telemetry for which she was asymptomatic and this was felt likely related to medications given patient had been started on both metoprolol, diltiazem, in addition to her sotalol.
She received IVF 250ml boluses x2 and her BP improved although in general her SBO was mainly in 90s and 100s.
The patient was initially continued on only sotalol 80mg po bid but due to persistent pauses and further AF with RVR, cardiology were [**Month/Day (4) 4221**], sotalol was stopped and she was continued on diltiazem and metoprolol.
She had continued episodes of RVR and diltiazem was uptitrated.
Other than very occasional tachycardic episodes, she achieved good rate control with diltiazem 75mg Q4H and metoprolol 25mg tid.
Following her PEG insertion, she was restarted on anticoagulation with warfarin (dabigatran cannot be crushed) with an overlap of aspirin until INR is therapeutic.
UA was positive and she was started on Ciprofloxacin on [**5-7**] for UTI (10,000 -100,000 Ecoli in urine) and was treated with a 3 day course.
She however started to spike fevers to 102.5F on [**5-10**] and she was started empirically on Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam on [**5-11**] for possible HAP but no good evidence of infection on CXRs.
To further investigate fevers, Doppler U/S of the legs revealed no evidence of DVT and ID were [**Month/Day (1) 4221**] when she again spiked a fever to 101.5F on [**5-14**] who recommended awaiting cultures and completing antibiotic course with further investigations if further fevers.
Her fevers settled and were felt likely secondary to HAP/aspiration pneumonia and she completed an 8 day course of Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam stopped on [**2199-5-17**].
# GIS: In the process of her infectious workup, she was found to have a splenic infarct on her abdominal ultrasound.
She had significant fecal loading and she was treated with laxatives.
She had guaiac positive stool as below but did not represent melaena and did not require endoscopy after GI consultation.
Her Hb drop was felt to represent her MDS given grossly inadequate reticulocyte count 0.1. .
Given her stroke and risks associated with increasing blood viscosity, darbepoetin was held while in hospital.
After hematology, GI and general surgery consults, this was felt to represent her MDS and required 2 units of RBCs and she had been usually requiring 2 units per month in the community prior to starting darbepoetin.
Her CBC will need to be trended at rehab and there they should consider restarting darbepoetin as per hematology.
# RS: Patient was persistently tachypneic during her hospitalisation and this improved.
CXRs showed atelectasis and effusions which improved after her home furosemide was restarted and she was treated with an 8 day course of IV piperacillin /tazobactam for presumed HCAP/aspiration pneumonia although there was no clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
A Dobbhoff was placed and she was started on low dose TFs that were then titrated up to a nutritional level.
Speech re-evaluated patient and found persistent poor swallow aspirating on all consistencies and she proceeded to a PEG tube insertion on [**2199-5-17**].
# [**Male First Name (un) **]: She had urinary retention following catheter removal and straight cathed 700ml.
A urinary catheter was placed on the day of transfer due to continued retention.
Will need regular CBC checks at rehab and may require transfusion as required.
- Darbepoetin has been held and should be restarted as deemed appropriate by hematology - she has hematology follow-up - She has had episodes of AF with RVR and she may require further uptitration of her diltiazem or metoprolol although has been well controlled over the past 3 days.
- Following PEG, patient was started on warfarin with goal INR [**2-8**].
She will be overlapped with aspirin 81mg and s/c heparin until INR is therapeutic.
- Patient had PEG tube on [**2199-5-17**] and has been discharged on tube feeds.
- Patient had urinary retention following removal of catheter.

Embolic large right middle cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery infarcts likely secondary to AF/AFlutter and inadequate anticoagulation (taking half dose dabigatran) 2.
Dysphagia secondary to above requiring PEG tube insertion 3.
This was felt to be a result of a combination of your irregular heartbeat and that you were mistakenly only taking your Pradaxa once as opposed to twice per day.
You were initially admitted to the ICU and you had high heart rates which required medications to treat this.
You were treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for a likely pneumonia and the fevers settled.
For this reason and to reduce your risk of strokes we started you on warfarin which is another blood thinner.
You had significant swallowing problems and you were initially fed with an NG tube but given continued poor swallowing on repeated assessments, you had a feeding tube called a PEG tube inserted into your stomach on [**2199-5-17**].
There were no complications from your surgery and you were transferred to rehab on [**2199-5-23**].
Your blood cpount dropped an this was felt likely due to your myelodysplastic syndrome and you required a blood transfusion for this.
Medication changes: We STARTED aspirin to overlap with warfarin until INR is therapeutic We STARTED warfarin 5mg daily We STOPPED dabigatran We HELD darbepotin and this can be restarted on the advice of hematology who you will see in clinic We CHANGED diltiazem extended release to diltiazem 75mg every 4 hours We STOPPED sotalol We CHANGED omeprazole to famotidine We CHANGED simvastatin to atorvastatin 20mg daily We STOPPED tramadol We STARTED metoprolol 25mg three times daily  Please continue your other medications as prescribed  Followup Instructions: Please see your PCP on discharge from rehab.
