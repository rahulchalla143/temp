She was treated with cisplatin and etoposide and radiation therapy to the chest for metastases to the thoracic spine in [**2107**].
A few months ago, she was noted to have metastases to the left pelvis which was also treated with radiation therapy.
More recently, she was discovered to have metastases to the liver which have also been treated a total of five cycles of chemotherapy with her last dose administered on [**2109-12-12**] (five days prior to admission).
The patient was doing well on the day after her last chemotherapy except for left shoulder pain which was relieved with the application of Bengay.
She denies hemoptysis of dysphagia, but she has been using her inhaler more frequently over the last three days.
Small cell lung carcinoma diagnosed in [**2107-11-30**], and status post radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
Metastases to T11, status post radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
Metastases to cerebellum, status post resection and whole brain radiation therapy.
Metastases to the left pelvis, status post radiation therapy.
Metastases to the liver, status post chemotherapy times five cycles.
Laminectomy in [**2092**].

While in the Intensive Care Unit, she was stabilized on noninvasive ventilation and frequent nebulizers.
She was started on steroids for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare, and her dyspnea improved significantly.
There was some concern for a pulmonary embolism given her history of pleuritic chest pain and hypercoagulable state, given her cancer, and she was restarted on heparin as her INR on admission was subtherapeutic.
After stabilization in the Intensive Care Unit, she was transferred back to the floor where she was continued on albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers; eventually spacing to q.8h.
Additionally, she was continued on Flovent and Singulair as well as starting Serevent during this admission.
She was sent home on a prednisone taper as well.
ONCOLOGY:  The patient has a history of small cell lung carcinoma with metastases to the brain, [**Year (4 digits) 500**], and liver; status post multiple rounds of radiation therapy and resections.
She was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] for further chemotherapy regimens.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  On presentation, the patient had subjective fevers at home with a low-grade temperature and 100.7 on admission.
As such, she was treated for a febrile neutropenia given her recent chemotherapy.
She was started on cefepime 2 g q.8h.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, she had a sputum culture which grew out yeast and was thought to be oropharyngeal in origin given her inhaled steroid use.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, her antibiotics were switched from cefepime and azithromycin to Levaquin, vancomycin, and Flagyl; and eventually narrowed the spectrum to Levaquin as possible sources of infection were excluded.
She was continued on a 7-day course of Levaquin for pneumonia in the setting of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
The Levaquin was discontinued just prior to discharge.
She was also started on Nystatin swish-and-swallow for yeast noted on sputum culture.
She was tachycardic for the first half of her admission which resolved with fluid rehydration.
Her diltiazem was titrated up as her blood pressure would allow, and she was back on her outpatient regimen of diltiazem-XL 180 mg p.o.
The etiology of her bump in creatinine was unknown; however, it was temporally related to two doses of intravenous Lasix.
Her Coumadin was subtherapeutic on admission at 1.7, and she was started on heparin in the Intensive Care Unit for possible pulmonary embolism.
Her Coumadin dose was increased, and her INR bumped to 9.
She was given one dose of vitamin K, and her Coumadin normalized with 36 hours.
The patient's admission hematocrit was read around baseline of 30; however, her hematocrit fell to 26, and she was given 2 units of packed red blood cells with an appropriate response.
Her initial presentation included a history of poor oral intake for which she was aggressively rehydrated with intravenous fluids.
NEUROLOGIC SYSTEM:  The patient has a history of metastases to the cerebellum; status post resection and radiation therapy.
It was felt that her hypoglycemia was secondary to insulin given from the sliding-scale in combination with acute renal failure with the insulin remaining in the bloodstream longer than normal.
Diltiazem-XL 180 mg p.o.
Multivitamin one tablet p.o.
Coumadin 4 mg p.o.

Prednisone taper.

The patient was sent home with [**First Name (Titles) 407**] [**Last Name (Titles) 11807**] and instructions on using new nebulizer machine.
She did not require home oxygen at this time as her oxygen saturations remained 95% to 98% on room air at the time of discharge.
