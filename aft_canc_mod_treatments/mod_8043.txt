His course was complicated by hemoptysis thought to be due to intubation, and hypoxia that was thought to possibly be pneumonia and the patient was discharged with Levofloxaxin for possible infection/bronchitis.
He denies any lightheadedness, dizziness, syncope, pleuritic pain, increased cough, rhinorrhea, PND, orthopnea, palpitations, abdominal swelling, leg swelling or weight gain.
Of note he reports that he's had decreasing appetite resulting in decreasing weight over the past couple years.
He was started empirically on PO Vancomycin for presumed culture negative Cdiff.
He was noted to have a CXR with a possible left sided infiltrate and a KUB with air fluid levels and unchanged chronic ventral incisional hernia, which resulted in a Surgery consult and eventual unrevealing CT Abdomen.
He was treated with IV Vancomycin and IV Levofloxacin for pneumonia, diltiazem for tachycardia and given 2L NS and transferred to the ICU as he required a NRB for hypoxia   Past Medical History: 1.
CAD - s/p Anterior MI > [**2153**], CABG [**2171**] (SVG to dRCA, SVG to LAD, SVG to OM1), s/p PCI LM, Lcx, RCA [**2172**] followed by redo CABG [**12/2172**] 2.
Prostate ca s/p Suprapubic prostatectomy 7.

Likely progression of events: CDiff diarrhea causing N/V/D-->aspiration event-->strain on lungs and heart-->SOB, decreased O2 sats, cardiac enzyme leak.
UTI as consequence of foley for I/O measurement.
# Hypoxia/SOB: Thought to be multifactorial, including baseline ILD, new aspiration PNA, anemia, new NSTEMI, and diastolic CHF/fluid overload.
Pt was evaluated by speech and swallow and found to have no prandial aspiration, but given ventral and hiatal hernias, and recent vomiting, aspiration remained most likely cause of new pneumonia found on CT scan.
This was treated with Vancomycin and Ceftazadime IV, and to be continued for an 8 day course via his left midline (placed at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab).
He improved with gentle diuresis and at time of discharge was satting mid 90s on 3L oxygen.
He was continued on his prior medical management of ASA, statin, and beta-blocker increased (for afib rate control).
Plavix was stopped (stent placed 3 years ago and guaiac positive stool) and ACE inhibitor stopped (for worsening renal function).
He remained slightly hypervolemic and responded well to gentle diuresis.
He was hemodynamically stable and well rate controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem.
The 3rd stool sent here returned positive and pt was successfully treated with PO Flagyl with symptomatic improvement.
Flagyl is to be continued for 1 week after finishing other antibiotics.
Pt was started on Vancomycin and Ceftazedime and responded well symptomatically.
Of note, he had a rash allergy to penicillin but was tolerating the Ceftazedime well.
# Ecoli UTI: Pt was initially started on Cipro but later found to be resistent.
He later required diuresis for CHF and renal function fluctuated.
ACE inhibitor was held, as were other nephrotoxins, and meds renally dosed.
He required 2 units pRBCs on [**3-11**] for Hct 22.5, in setting of NSTEMI and shortness of breath.
