He suffered a reinfarction in [**2155**] and ICD placement for a ventricular fibrillation arrest.
More recently he has been having multiple episodes of heart failure, a pulseless electrical activity arrest following anesthesia and recently suffered a myocardial infarction on [**2172-4-29**] following surgery to removed a squamous cell skin cancer from his left temporal region.
He was admitted to [**Hospital3 2576**] [**Hospital3 **] where he underwent a recatheterization revealing native left main and three vessel disease along with two of three vein grafts occluded.
His vein graft to the left anterior descending artery was patent.
Given that he needs further surgery with regards to his left temporal squamous cell skin cancer, he has been referred for evaluation for a redo CABG prior to any further surgical procedures.
It is felt that he is rather high risk to undergo general anesthesia for any further surgery without his coronary disease first being addressed.
He is admitted today for further pre-op workup and heparin bridge.
Last dose of coumadin was Wednesday, [**2172-6-24**].
