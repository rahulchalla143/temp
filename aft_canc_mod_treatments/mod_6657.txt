Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 35 year old woman with a history of T-cell lymphoma who was admitted for scheduled ablative chemotherapy with TBI and Cytoxan followed by allogeneic cord stem cell transplant.
#) T cell lymphoma:  The pt presented for scheduled allogeneic cord stem cell transplant (Day 0 [**2149-1-22**]).
She was briefly covered with cefepime but the episode quickly passed and cefepime was stopped.
The pt tolerated the transplant well and was weaned off of steroids per the transplant protocol.
At that time the pt was started on Daptomycin, and Zosyn and Casponfungin were added later as she continued to have fevers.
On Day 16 post transplant the pt was still awaiting recovery of her cell counts but had developed renal failure in the setting of likely tacrolimus toxicity and she was transfered to the ICU for initiation of hemodialysis.
At this time there was also mounting evidence (right upper quadrant, ascites) that the patient was developing [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease of the liver, and the pt was started on a protocol for treatment with defibrotide.
On [**2149-2-20**] the pt's labs began to show evidence of engraftment, but soon after this the patient's fever curve began to increase as steroids were tapered.
An extensive infectious work-up was pursued, but the pt was noted to have increasing numbers of atypical cells on her daily white blood cell differential which was concerning for a recurrence of the pt's hematologic malignancy.
On [**2149-2-27**] the care team met with the patient's family to discuss the patient's grave condition and the decision was made to change the pt's code status to DNR/DNI and to continue to provide antibiotics and pain medication for comfort as the goal of care.
