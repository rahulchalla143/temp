TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1-weighted images were obtained following administration of [**Hospital 3173**] gadolinium.
3D high-resolution time-of-flight sequence was performed.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular blood products are not definitely appreciated on this study due to limited examination.
Short-term two-week followup is recommended to document resolution of this finding.
There is a gastrostomy tube seen in situ.
There is a urinary catheter seen in the bladder with air likely representing recent bladder instrumentation  MUSCULOSKELETAL: There are multiple left-sided rib fractures.
Gastrostomy tube is seen within the stomach.
TECHNIQUE: Serial transverse images were acquired sequentially through the brain and reconstructed at stacked 5 mm transverse sections.
DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7411**] Approved: TUE [**2142-7-31**] 2:10 PM    Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 67 y/o male, prior trach and peg, with advance SCC jaw cancer(dx [**2114**], s/p XRT with brachytherapy, recurrence [**3-3**]) who follows at [**Hospital1 336**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after a fall down a flight of stairs on [**7-31**].
Hemorrhagic contusion R temp, R frontal SAH, coup-contra-coup  2.
On morning of [**2142-8-6**] pt had been sat'ing 99% on 35% trach mask, was having peg dressing changed, and was noted to have labored breathing (RR=30s), and desat to 84% on 35% trach mask, up to 92% on 100% trach mask.
CXR was concerning for pneumothoraax, and pt was tnrasfered to MICU for AC ventilation via trach and closer monitoring.
Upon arrival to MICU [**8-8**] pt breathing comfortably on AC ventilation  (98.7   109  134/77   100% AC 450x12 50% PEEP 5).
Given concern for thickened secretions, pt continued on zosyn empirically ?new/ongoing pna.
pt was stable on AC ventilation throughout [**8-8**] and was transitioned to PS then back to trach mask without difficulty.
ddx also included PE given onc history/pelvic fracture, however given acute improvement, and recent dye loads, plan made for CTA on following morning which did show new PE and right femoral DVT.
IVC was placed in interventional radiology on [**8-9**], though plan made not to anticoagulate pt given SAH and contusion.
Pt was otherwise gradually weaned from AC ventilation to PS then to 35% trach mask with sats 90-100%.
pain control maintained with morphine and fentanyl patch.
Patient has remained in 2 point restraints and belt, out of concern that he would pull out his trach or lines.
He was started on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
He received an MRI of the brain w/ & w/o to r/o brain mets, no obvious mets were seen but could not be ruled out in the setting of brain contusion.

He was quickly weaned off the vent in the first 24 hours of his admission.
In on zosyn for PNA c tobramycin nebs.
Patient still requires frequent trach suctioning.
He was weaned from pressors with in 48 hours of admit.
Patient is end stage jaw cancer s/p recurrence.
