Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 60235**] saw her at that time, started her on Flagyl and arranged for today's visit.
She was started on IV fluid transfusions, and electrolyte repletion.
She was given doses of vanco, flagyl,and Aztreonam.
She required immediate leukapheresis and was started on hydroxyurea and allopurinol.
On the second day after admission she went into a DIC with onset of acute renal failure, which resolved with IV fluids.
She was treated with 7 and 3(cytarabine and idarubicin) with subsequent complications of prolonged febrile neutropenia, VRE bacteremia, cephalitis, and mucositis.
Unfortunately, she was noted for persistent disease and received a cycle of clofarabine.
She was initiated on conditioning with fludarabine, Cytoxan, and TBI.
She was initiated on IV Solu-Medrol, which was then switched to oral prednisone prior to her discharge.
She has continued on CellCept [**Pager number **] mg q12h and Tacrolimus 0.5 mg q12h.
She also has been on Entocort 3 mg three times per day.
She was then cleared to go home, but continues to be seen frequently in clinic for IV fluid support and has been requiring potassium and magnesium supplementation.
Skin: petechial bruising on dorsolateral wrists extending 4-5cm by 2 cm.

Focal airspace consolidation of the left lower lobe at site of prior thoracentesis that may be developing infection with adjacent ground glass opacities that may be a component of reexpansion pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: #ICU Course 1: She was initially admitted on [**9-10**] with dehydration and diarrhea.
#ICU Course 2: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 51-year-old woman with a history of AML day day 122+ s/p double cord allogeneic transplant who was admitted with fevers and diarrhea s/p 3 day [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay for hypotension and tachycardia now with hypotension in setting of rapid heart rate.
BP improved to baseline with volume resuscitation and PRBCs.
The patient reports that she was sleeping this evening and was woken up for routine VS check.
She was given metoprolol 5mg IV x3 and on each occasion her HR did not change but her BP dropped to mid 80s.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the floor following normalization of her blood pressure with fluids and control of her heart rate with metoprolol.
She was placed on telemetry and remained in sinus rhythm.
She once again became febrile to 100-101, and was placed on empiric broad spectrum antibiotics including daptomycin for her history of VRE, and aztreonam, though she continued to spike.
She developed shortness of breath with new oxygen requirement, and given her moderate-large pleural effusions, she underwent thoracentesis of the left pleural space on [**2187-9-28**], and 800cc of clear fluid was withdrawn.
The procedure was cut short due to patient inability to tolerate further fluid withdrawal.
Following further respiratory distress, she again underwent CTA of the chest, which demonstrated worsened pleural effusions, with a moderate to large bilateral pleural effusion, in addition to diffuse bilateral upper lobe consolidations.
Ciprofloxacin was added to her antibiotics to enhance gram negative coverage, and her daptomycin was substituted for by linezolid for better pulmonary penetration.
IP was again called the following day, and she underwent thoracentesis and bronchoscopy on [**2187-10-2**].
Following her bronchoscopy, she developed respiratory distress with desaturations and was directly transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] without returning first to the floor.
She underwent LP on [**2187-9-30**] to evaluate for leptomeningeal infiltration of her malignancy.
#ICU course 3: Respiratory failure s/p bronchoscopy and pleurocentesis.
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 60232**] developed sudden hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation on [**2187-10-2**] after bronchoscopy and pleural tap.
She was treated with broad-spectrum Abx (Vanc, Cefepime, Cipro, Flagyl with multiple prophylactic medications).
Fluid boluses including albumin given to maintain BP along with pressors.
Lasix gtt started.
Pt continuing to overbreathe vent with significant Barriers to extubation included total body volume overload as well as breathing over the vent.
Repeat echo showed cardiac tamponade [**2-13**] pericardial effusions, which was tapped on [**10-19**] draining 800cc of pericardial fluid which was found to be + for AML.
She was initially treated for toxoplasmosis but this was discontinued when toxo PCR from pericardial fluid was negative.
Course further complicated by SVT requiring eletric cardioversion and amio ggt converted to PO amio, continued pressor dependence, skin impairments of the arms bilaterally with wound culture positive for coag + staph.
Pt was eventually determiend to be DNR/DNI with subsequent decision to change goals of care to comfort on [**10-30**] and morphine/ativan drips started.
