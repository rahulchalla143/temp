68 yo M with Stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma) with metastatic disease to brain discovered in [**9-/2110**] after focal seizure s/p cyberknife and hx of complete heart block s/p pacemaker who presents to the ED today after a presyncopal episode.
He has since been on a decadron taper that finished today and completed cyberknife.
In ED:  98  76P  110/42  20  95%RA; guaiac negative; given 2L NS and hydrocortisone 100mg for presumed adrenal insufficiency; CXR showed PNA - started on cefepime and vancomycin; Head CT showed improvement of vasogenic edema; abdominal CT showed stable AAA and no rp bleed .
Stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma) with a potential T4N0 tumor (stage III, 7th TNM), EGFR wild-type 2.
Status post 2 cycles of cisplatin 50 mg/m2 D1, D8 and etoposide 50 mg/m2 D1-D5 of a 28 day cycle on [**2109-2-18**] and [**2109-3-18**].He started concurrent chemoradiation therapy on [**2109-2-15**].
Day 8 cisplatin was held during cycle 1 for AAA repair.
Day 8 cisplatin was held during cycle 2 for thrombocytopenia.
S/p cyberknife and decadron taper for brain mets  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1.
Status post endovascular aortic aneurysm repair on 03/[**2108**].
New severe alveolitis or other alveolar filling process primarily involving the upper lobes and therefore most likely connected to prior radiation therapy denoted by longstanding paramediastinal pulmonary fibrosis.
The differential diagnosis includes delayed cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, drug-induced pneumonitis potentiated by prior radiation (given the appropriate clinical history of ongoing chemotherapy, unknown to me).
[**2110-11-19**]: B-GLUCAN Fungitell (tm) Assay for (1,3)-B-D-Glucans Results: >500 pg/mL* Reference Ranges Negative: Less than 60 pg/mL   Indeterminate: 60 - 79 pg/mL Positive: Greater than or equal to 80 pg/mL .
[**2110-11-20**] Legionella Urinary Antigen: NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
[**2110-11-21**] Chest xray: IMPRESSION: In addition to the biapical radiation changes, there is likely overlying atypical organism infection, possibly PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] drug toxicity from chemotherapy that has now spread to the left mid, left lower, and right lower lung fields.
Hypoxic Respiratory Failure, progressive alveolar process: This is a 68 year old gentleman with CHB s/p PPM and Stage IV NSCLC (adenoCa) with a single brain metastasis s/p cyberknife one month ago and subsequent decadron taper terminating on the day of admission.
This hypotension resolved without intervention prior to his arrival in the ED where he was given broad spectrum antibiotics (HCAP coverage) for bilateral apical infiltrates and stress dose steroids for potential adrenal insufficiency.
The differential diagnosis entertained included COP as a late term sequelae of the chest radiation he had received one year prior, atypical PCP with particular concern for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] less likely possiblities such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, vasculitides, and pulmonary hemmorhage.
On HD2, he required 2L by nasal cannula to maintain O2 sats in the low 90s.
In addition to the vancomycin and cefepime he had been receiving since admission, he was started on azithromycin and high dose IV bactrim with steroids (to empirically cover PCP and also potentially steroid-responsive inflammatory lung diseases such as COP).
Pulmonary was consulted regarding bronchoscopy, but this was cancelled given his worsening oxygen requirement which progressed despite empiric treatments.
He was transferred to the medical ICU on [**11-22**] as he began to require a non-rebreather to maintain sats in the low 90s.
However, B-glucan was grossly elevated to >500, galactomannam was elevated at 0.5, and LDH was elevated up to 754, suspicion was high for PCP pneumonia and patient was started on bactrim DS and steroids.
He completed a 7 day course of broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime and azithromycin) to cover for HCAP.
The patient's oxygenation steadily improved on bactrim and prednisone although he continues to require supplement O2 ( 5 lits ) per nasal cannula.As below, pt developed transaminitis and pan-cytopenia while on bactrim.
His AM cortisol over 24 hours after stress dose steroids were stopped was 20, making this very unlikely.Pt is being d/c on prednisone ( as part of treatment for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**]) and will need a slow taper after completion of treatment dose.
Likely causes included  some element of SIADH secondary to lung inflammation/NSCLC  and this was likely exacerbated by mild hypovolemia as his sodium did increase with normal saline.
Treated with high sodium diet, mild fluid restriction and intermittant IVF as required by his volume status.Pt being d/c with low dose of oral supplemental salt.
Pancytopenia: On admission, His thrombocytopenia and leukopenia improved without intervention and was attributed to acute illness.
However, his anemia recurred mostly likley from myelosuppression due to high dose bactrim and he required 2 units PRBCs on [**2110-11-30**] and [**2110-12-1**].
Iron studies, B12 and folate did not show deficiencies and work up did not support hemolysis.On d/c plts are trending down and levels need to be followed closely as an outpt.
Long term the issue was managed by decreasing the patient's carvedilol dose, adding low torsemide every other day with or without IV hydration depending on the patient's volume status.Pt being d/c on a low K diet and electroltyes will need to be monitored as an outpt.
Transaminitis with elevated alkaline phos and normal bilirubin: The patient was assymptomatic and these laboratory changes were thought most likely due to drug effect.
The patient's statin was discontinued and his keppra was changed to zonisamide.
HTN: Held home meds on admission.
DECREASED carvedilol (coreg) 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] --> 3.125 [**Hospital1 **] to allow every other day torsemide to manage hyperkalemia.
BP remained stable on this dose after discontinuation of torsemide but may need to titrated back up.
HLD: Given his transaminitis, discontinued simvastatin.
Acute delerium at night: managed with Haldol 0.5-1 mg QHS with marked improvement though not complete resolution.
Medications on Admission: Carvedilol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] Dexamethasone taper - finished today, taper started [**2110-10-27**] with 4mg daily Levetiracetam 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] Lisinopril 10mg daily Prilosec 20mg [**Hospital1 **] Simvastatin 20mg daily ASA 81mg daily MVI  Discharge Medications: 1. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day).

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] [**Location (un) 1121**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PCP (pneumoncystis) pneumonia Lung cancer with brain metastases Elevated Liver function tests Hyperkalemia (high potassium) Hypoxemia (low oxygen) Hyponatremia (low sodium) Diffuse weakness Degenerative joint disease Left arm swelling Delerium at night High blood pressure High cholesterol Heart burn pan-cytopenia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath from PCP (pneumoncystis) pneumonia that required intensive care unit monitoring for your oxygen levels.
You are being treated with 3 weeks of bactrim antibiotics with prednisone steroid medication and you have been steadily improving.
Your strength has been improving and tests did not reveal a cause for weakness.You liver function tests have been elevated so your statin has been stopped and your anti seizure medication has been changed.Your potassium has been high probably from the bactrim antibiotic you need for your pneumonia.
This has been treated with a water pill (toresamide), IV fluids, and decreasing your carvedilol blood pressure medication.You have received 2 blood transfusions for anemia with good response.
You have had confusion at night time that has been treated with Haldol at bedtime.
