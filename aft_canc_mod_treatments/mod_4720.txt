In the ED, he got 6L NS, vancomycin IV 1gm, levofloxacin 500mg, flagyl 500mg, and heparin infusion before MICU called.
IV heparin drip was continued for his PE, transitioned to lovenox on transfer to floor.
Pancreatic CA: diagnosed 3 months ago, with mets in liver, s/p Whipple 1 month ago, s/p cisplatin 10 days ago 2. s/p Whipple procedure 3.
DM2: controlled w/ insulin  Social History: Lives w/ wife in [**Name (NI) 745**], works as a contractor (currently on leave of abscence), has a son who is a [**Name (NI) **] resident in [**Doctor First Name 26692**] and another son who plays the violin professionally.
[**2-14**] lovenox injections) Ext: warm, faint DP B, trace edema bilaterally Neuro: a/o, moving all extremities, able to follow commands, no focal deficits.
CXR([**11-30**]): left sided pleural effusion, rounded opacity in RUL zone w/ suggestion of cavitation.
Subclavian line in place, no PTX.
There is extension of this into the adjacent duodenum, and extensive hepatic, mesenteric, and left adrenal metastases.
Additionally, there are two small foci of air adjacent to the liver, which may be from recent intervention such as paracentesis.
There are wedge-shaped areas of different attenuation within the liver which may represent focal fatty infiltration or perfusion abnormalities.
Tip of the left PIC catheter projects over the left brachiocephalic vein.
Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach.
**PATHOLOGY** [**12-11**] peritoneal fluid:  blood and inflammatory cells, cytology negative for malignant cells  Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 59-yo Russian speaking man w/ pancreatic CA s/p failed whipple and cisplatin therapy, HTN, DM2 admitted initially to MICU fpr pulmonary embolism and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, s/p IV heparin drip transitioned to lovenox subcutaneously, with SBP being treated with Zosyn.
He is status post 3 paracenteses this admission (first [**2120-11-30**], 2nd [**2120-12-7**], 3rd [**2120-12-11**]) with first growing Enterococcus and Bacteroides fragilis.
Despite multiple consultations with Liver, Infectious Disease, Renal and Surgery specialists, the patient's prognosis remained poor, and despite agressive treatment with paracenteses, intravenous antibiotics, IVF, intravenous heparin, the patient expired on [**2120-12-12**].
Plans were instituted for ICU transfer, thoracentesis, possible intubation, however, the patient stated he did not want further agressive measures taken.
On the morning of his death, he and his wife (his health care proxy), along with his sons, determined that he did not want further measures taken, and he wanted to be comfortable.
He was made comfortable on a morphine drip and expired in the afternoon, surrounded by his family.
S/p 9L IVF for fluid resuscitation over 24 hours.
Pt did not require pressors and he made gradual improvement in MICU.
Concern for sepsis [**2-14**] to bacterial peritonitis from recent surgical procedure/instrumentation vs. questionable abscess on CT abd according to surgical opinion (again likely [**2-14**] to recent failed surgical attempt at removal off mass, CT showing free air/bubbles/septations/loculated ascites) vs. partial SBO/intermittent SBO causing translocation of enteric organisms across bowel wall.
Other potential sources included the cavitary lesion seen on CXR therefore there was a questions of a possible necrotizing PNA with his b/l pleural effusions (at the time felt to be less likely, most reasonable explanation is old TB infection but cannot r/out reactivation, especially given the new [**Name (NI) 65425**] pt was transfered to isolation room, 3 sputum cx sent, and were much later found to be positive for TB, infection control notified, as were the health care workers exposed).
He was diuresed for volume overload with IV lasix.
The patient remained on Vanco/Zosyn for broad coverage including coverage of Enterococcus and Bacteroids growing from pleural fluid.
IV Vancomycin and Zosyn were continued until the patient was made CMO on [**2120-12-12**].
He underwent his third and final therapeutic/diagnostic tap on [**12-11**] with cytology negative, fluid cx negative, neg for Mycobacteria or fungus as well.
He was initially started on octreotide and mitodrine, however, this was tapered off over 3 days, as hepatorenal syndrome was felt to be less likely after noting the pt's UOP responded to IVF boluses and IVF hydration.
All nephrotoxic medications were held and contrast was held in the setting of his oliguia.
The patient demonstrated low liver function tests, likely secondary to diseased liver without synthetic function at this stage, with his PT increasing slowly over time, Albumin decreasing 1.5->1.2 prior to initiation of albumin.
Hypoxia: Throughout the patient's admission, he required 3L oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain sats above 95%.
He desatted two times during this admission, most likely secondary to volume overload from repeated fluid boluses, and was given nebs, IV lasix with improvement in respiratory status.
He was started on morphine, and his breathing was made comfortable.
After transfer to medical floor, he was put in an isolation room, and TB precautions were taken.
He was initially started on an IV heparin drip with goal PTT 60-80, then transitioned to lovenox prior to transfer to the medical floor from the MICU.
He remained on lovenox until he was made CMO/DNR/DNI.
Also s/p 10 days of Cisplatin in [**Country 532**], although records were not available from [**Country 532**].
Hematology/Oncology at [**Hospital1 18**] was called, and stated that gemcitabine would be a possible option (as an outpatient), with 30% response rate, impossible to predict responders.
Type II DM: His glucose levels were well controlled with an insulin sliding scale, and fingersticks were checked four times daily.
He was given a bowel regimen and Milk of magnesia.
The pt's pain was controlled on fentanyl and dilaudid, with no pain complaints.
Fentanyl patch 100mcg q 72 hours 3.
Dilaudid 4mg PO q 4 hours prn 4.
Zofran 4mg PO q 8 hours prn 5. reglan 10mg po TID 6. marinol 5mg tid 7. paxil 20mg daily  Discharge Medications: None, pt expired [**2120-12-12**].
