A chest X ray showed an opacity so she was given ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.

?s age and poor prognosis with leukemia - a family meeting was held to determine whether or not she should have a confirmatory bone marrow biopsy and undergo chemotherapy.
It was decided not to undergo a bone marrow biopsy and chemotherapy was not consistent with her goals of care.
# Pericardial effusion: In the ED the patient underwent CTA for her dyspnea and was found to have evidence of moderate sized pericardial effusion.
Pulsus paradoxus was not elevated at 10 mm hg and she had no evidence of hemodynamic compromise (although she did have transient hypotension in the ED that was responsive to a small bolus of IV fluids).
Heme/Onc was consulted and it was decided not to pursue fluid diagnosis with pericardiocentesis given comfort goals as stated above.
Her chest x ray showed evidence of cardiomegally with widened mediastinum and cephalization of blood vessels and peribronchial cuffing consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion.
She was started on BiPAP as she was hypoxic, and this improved her O2 sats and tachycardia.
She was given lasix 10mg IV ONCE which resulted in nearly 800cc output over a few hours.
This improved her respiratory status, she was weaned to NC and remained comfortable on the floor.
Her urine potassium excretion was unrevealing.
She was given atropine which converted the tachyarrhytmia to sinus.
# Hypertension: The patient's atenolol was initially held in the setting of uncertaintly regarding her hemodynamic state with the pericardial effusion.
However, she remained hemodynamically stable so her atenolol was restarted the following morning.
