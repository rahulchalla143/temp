SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  In brief, the patient is an 85-year-old white male with a history of coronary artery disease, aortic valve manipulation of unclear nature, recent Enterococcal subacute bacterial endocarditis currently on intravenous ampicillin, recent Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus urinary tract infection, currently on vancomycin intravenous, dementia, presenting with abdominal distention secondary to sigmoid volvulus and respiratory distress.
Rectal tube remained in place overnight until patient dislodged it with large bowel movement of formed stool.
As volvulus had resolved, rectal tube was not reinserted.
Given complete resolution of volvulus, nasogastric tube remained out.
The patient was followed closely with serial abdominal exams and remained with soft non tympanitic abdomen without any evidence of tenderness.
However, family was clear throughout this admission that they do not desire surgery for their father.
The patient required large volume intravenous fluid and electrolyte repletion secondary to voluminous diarrhea.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient has been on intravenous vancomycin and intravenous ampicillin the last three to four weeks for a history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus urinary tract infection in [**2153-4-23**] as well as Enterococcal faecium, endocarditis (question prosthetic aortic valve versus annuloplasty of aortic valve).
Source of infection unclear at time of admission, however highly suspect source from gastrointestinal tract, although cannot rule out line infection, genitourinary infection or other endovascular source such as prosthetic valve endocarditis given recent history.
Thus, the patient was initially covered broadly with intravenous vancomycin, intravenous Flagyl and intravenous Levaquin as well as ampicillin to better cover Enterococcal bacteremia/endocarditis.
Patient had indwelling Foley for greater than two weeks at time of admission and thus Foley was discontinued and repeat urinalysis was sent which was consistent with bacterial urinary tract infection.
Thus, the patient was continued on Levaquin to cover both abdominal and urinary bacteria.
Vancomycin was subsequently discontinued and blood cultures remained negative for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus as well as urinary cultures.
The patient proceeded to do extremely well after decompression of sigmoid volvulus with rapid resolution of leukocytosis.
The patient was subsequently switched over to po Flagyl 500 mg po tid to cover possible Clostridium difficile colitis, as well as abdominal anaerobes.
The patient was continued on levofloxacin 500 mg po for coverage of gram negative urinary tract infection as well as possible intraabdominal source.
The patient was also continued on intravenous ampicillin for Enterococcal bacteremia documented in [**2153-4-23**] with question endocarditis.
As patient showed significant clinical improvement, he was continued on the above antibiotic regimen.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient with history of coronary artery disease, status post bypass grafting of unknown anatomy.
His digoxin level was subtherapeutic at time of admission and digoxin was initially held, as the patient was not taking po.
Digoxin was restarted on hospital day #2 and digoxin levels were followed.
Electrical cardioversion should be considered as patient without history of prior atrial fibrillation.
Patient was also started on low dose Lopressor for improved rate control, which he tolerated well.
Despite large volume intravenous fluid repletion with free water and half normal saline, the patient continued to exhibit hypernatremia at time of dictation.
He also exhibited severe hypokalemia which required persistent and large volume repletion, with up to 200 milliequivalents per day to maintain potassium within normal limits.
At time of dictation, electrolyte disturbances were yet to be resolved and patient persisted to have diarrhea, although it seems to be decreasing in frequency.
The patient also had severe hypophosphatemia which required intravenous repletion.
This subsequently resolved with intravenous fluid repletion and resolution of metabolic acidosis.
The patient's indwelling Foley bladder catheter was removed on [**6-20**] and the patient successfully voided with condom catheter.
There is a history of urinary retention, especially with patient's history of prostate CA, status post radiation therapy.
However, during this admission, the patient was able to urinate freely without Foley catheter in place.
Given urinary tract infection, the patient was left without placement of Foley catheter, however the patient's urine output needs to be closely monitored for possible urinary retention in future given his history and history of multiple urinary tract infections.
However, line site was without erythema or evidence of infection and what remained in place.
The patient will require another 7 to 10 days of intravenous ampicillin for treatment of subacute bacterial endocarditis.
Central line was also used for intravenous potassium and phosphate repletion.
Discussion occurred regarding changing single lumen over a wire to triple lumen, however this did not need to be done during this hospitalization.
It is important to note that line must be discontinued upon completion of intravenous ampicillin course.
I spoke with daughter-in-law, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 12070**], on [**6-21**] and updated her as to patient's progress and plan to return to [**Hospital6 18042**] given his physical therapy needs.
The patient was seen and evaluated by physical therapy in house who felt that he would benefit from one to two weeks of physical therapy for improved ambulation and gait training.
The patient also requires intravenous antibiotics for another seven days and thus will need placement and rehabilitation prior to final discharge to [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 66721**]Nursing Home.
FOLLOW UP:  As the patient will need another seven days of intravenous ampicillin (at time of dictation on [**2153-6-22**]) to complete five week course of intravenous ampicillin, it is highly recommended that the patient be seen in infectious disease consult clinic prior to discontinuation of intravenous ampicillin or subclavian central line.
He should follow up with infectious disease clinic at [**Hospital6 11896**] prior to continuation of these antibiotics or central line, given his questionable history of subacute bacterial endocarditis with Enterococcus faecium.
