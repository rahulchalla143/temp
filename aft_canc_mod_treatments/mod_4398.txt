Admission Date:  [**2114-5-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2114-5-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2039-9-13**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Latex / Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12131**] Chief Complaint: Weakness and lethargy, hyponatremia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement  History of Present Illness: 74F with metastatic melanoma s/p CyberKinfe and WBI to brain mets, currently on vemurafenib, HTN and anxiety who presented to the ED with 1 week of weakness.
She is still able to walk but states that she started using a walker recently and has trouble standing up from a chair.
She states that she went to a walk in clinic last week because she thought she was getting a pneumonia and was diagnosed with "upper respiratory tract infection" for which she was given "erythromycin" (?azithromycin).
She was diagnosed with melanoma in [**2104**] and was found to have brain metastases in [**2113**].
She was recently started on Zelboraf in [**3-/2114**] for her metastatic melanoma.
She had previously been enrolled in clinical trials before she was started on this new medication, but was not improving.
This was managed with whole brain radiation, CyberKnife and dexamethasone for the edema which she is still being tapered off of.
She had a CXR with concern for RLL infiltrate and she was started on Levofloxacin.
Past Medical History: -Malignant melanoma s/p Cyberkinfe and WBI -hypertension -anxiety -sciatica -mitral valve prolapse -hiatal hernia -peripheral neuropathy  ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: [**2104**], wide local excision of melanoma on the right thigh with lymph examination [**5-/2111**], recurrent nodule at previous site.
[**2112-4-5**], new lesion melanoma positive, status post wide local excision, sentinel lymph node biopsy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] negative.
[**2112-7-19**], status post external beam radiation to right thigh.
[**2113-3-27**], cycle 1, day 1 of protocol 10-056 part C monotherapy on GSK.
By protocol, patients on monotherapy are able to cross over to receive both GSK [**Telephone/Fax (1) 85556**] and GSK [**Telephone/Fax (1) 85557**] at the first sign of progressive disease.
[**2114-1-2**], discontinued protocol 10-056 for progression.
-CXR ([**2114-5-15**]): PICC line in the mid SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: 74F with metastatic melanoma s/p Cyberknife and WBI as well as treatment with vemurafenib, HTN and anxiety who presents with hyponatremia and weakness.
She was then fluid restricted and placed on salt tabs PO.
Her Na slowly improved with these conservative interventions, although she was mentating normally during her entire admission.
She was then placed back on a fluid restriction, salt tabs and started on Lasix 20mg PO daily to reduce her medullary concentration gradient and her Na remained in the high 120s to low 130s.
The etiology of her SIADH is likely multifactorial and related to her brain metastases, pneumonia as well as her pain and nausea.
Her fluoxetine was stopped at admission as SSRIs can cause or contribute to hyponatremia.
Her sodium level improved considerably, and we were able to stop lasix at the time of discharge.
She will continue to require salt tablets, will require ongoing monitoring of her sodium level following discharge.
We were able to liberalise her fluid restrictin to 1200ml daily.
Her atenolol was chanegd to metoprolol 12.5mg PO, eventually uptitrated to TID.
She was not anticoagulated for her PAF given her brain mets.
She endorses productive cough for the past 3-4 weeks, was recently treated with antibiotics prior to admission.
Notably, she was not on PCP prophylaxis at admission despite receiving dexamethasone for her brain mets.
She received a 5 day course of levofloxacin this admission.
We started her on azithromycin at the time of discharge, and she will complete this course of antibiotic for empiric treatmetn of possible bronchitis as an outpatient.
# Lower back and groin pain: The pain is similar to what she experiences at home, partially related to the prior surgery she had on her hip for melanoma.
Pain was improved with PO morphine and Lidoderm patches.
Zelboraf can also cause muscoloskeletal pain, and following discussion with her oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], we decided to hold the medication for one week starting [**2114-5-23**].
Her chemotherapy drug, Zelboraf is also known to cause generalized weakness: we decided to trial holding this medication for one week starting [**2114-5-23**] to see if her symptoms improve off the medication.
# Metastatic melanoma: She has recently received WBI and Cyberknife therapy for her brain mets and was currently on Zelboraf after being enrolled in clinical trials with no improvement in her disease.
She is being tapered off dexamethasone which she was started to help reduce cerebral edema during her rad/onc treatments.
We stopped dexamethasone on [**2114-5-23**], and she will need to followup with neuro-oncology for further management of her brain metastases.
She was continued on Zelboraf for most of this admission, but it was held temporarily for one week starting [**2114-5-23**] to assess whether the drug might be contributing to her pain.
As above, atenolol was changed to metoprolol.
# Anxiety: Continued on home clonazepam  # Code status this admission: FULL  # Transitional issues: 1.
He sodium has been stable above 130 for several days and we discontinued lasix on [**2114-5-23**].
If sodium level is above 132, please continue current medication regimen and check chem7 every 7 days to monitor her hyponatremia.
If sodium level is below 132, please consider restarting lasix and 20mg PO daily, then recheck sodium on [**2114-5-26**], then every 3 days until stable, and then every 1 week.
Metastatic melanoma: We stopped dexamethasone on [**7-23**].
Please have the patient call her oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], on [**2114-5-30**] to discuss whetehr or not to restart Zelboraf.
Bronchitis: We started azithromycin to treat possible bronchitis on [**2114-5-24**].
CXR and UA were normal and we started treatment for a possible bronchitis.

We treated your pneumonia, and changed any medications that might have been contributing to your low sodium.
We also treated you intially with intravenous concentrated saline, and eventually with salt tablets.
You also had pain in your back, hips and legs.
Following discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], we think that your pain is a combination of your sciatica and a side-effect of your vemurafenib.
We made the following changes to your medications:  STOPPED: -atenolol -dexamethasone -vemurafenib (for one week.
-fluoxetine -fluconazole  STARTED -senna, colace and bisacodyl to help you move your bowels -maalox for gas -metoprolol to help control your heart rate -tylenol, tramadol, morphine and lidocaine patch for pain -prochlorperazine for nausea  INCREASED clonazepam to three times daily  Please continue taking your other medications as usual.
