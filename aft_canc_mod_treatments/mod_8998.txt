Ca  Phos Mg [**2144-6-4**] 00:00      8.9 3.3  1.7 [**2144-6-3**] 00:30      9.2 3.3  1.8   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 109738**] is a 56 year-old gentleman with non-small cell lung cancer with known metastatic disease to the brain, s/p R-craniotomy and whole brain radiation, history of dementia and stroke, who presented with altered mental status and increased lethargy.
Therefore, the initial differential included bacterial meningitis and HSV encephalitis especially given pt's lethargy and somnolence.
He was initially covered with vancomycin, cefepime (due to pseudomonal coverage and good CSF penetration), ampicillin (for listeria coverage) and acyclovir.
Toxic-metabolic cause cannot be excluded given waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status.
Pt's outpatient Neuro-oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] was asked to comment on pt's status and he felt the picture was more consistent with encephalitis and agreed with broad antibiotic coverage, but decided to hold off on MRI until later, as pt just had MRI at the end of his radiation treatment which did not show new progression of disease.
Initially, broad antibiotic coverage for hospital acquired organisms and aspiration was initiated with vancomycin, cefepime (as above), flagyl for anaerobes and levofloxacin for atypical coverage.
The infectious disease service was then consulted and agreed with vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl but suggested discontinuing levofloxacin, acyclovir and ampicillin which was done on [**5-26**].
Since patient had been on long-term steroids, PCP prophylaxis with bactrim was also initiated.
Home lantus was initially continued at half pt's normal dose as he had been NPO, but then was increased to his normal dose when tube feeds began.
He was also covered with humalog sliding scale, as outpatient metformin was held.
LEUKOCYTOSIS- could be due to infection, inflammation, seizure or steroid use.
Pt was continued on Bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
Pt was also continued on home Levitiracetam and Dexamethasone taper (2mg daily currently).
Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 6767**] rec, start Dexamethasone 1 mg daily on [**6-8**], then start 0.5mg daily on [**6-22**], then start 0.5mg every other day on [**7-6**], and then stop dexamethasone on [**7-20**].
Pt was continued on Bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] since he is on steroids.
# DMII: Pt's home Metformin was held during hospital stay but restarted upon discharge.
Pt was also on insulin sliding scale and fingersticks QID.
Was treated with Flagyl PO, which needs to be continued for 4 more days to complete a 10 day course.
# Tobacco abuse: Pt's on Nicotine patch daily.
However, after counseling him about it, pt would decide again that he wants to stay NPO and on tubefeeds to reduce risk of aspiration.
IF pt and HCP do decide to let him eat, he should be on ground solids and nectar thick liquids.
Pt was on SC Heparin for DVT ppx.
