[**3-11**] Tagged RBC Scan: INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the abdomen for minutes were obtained.
[**3-12**] Angiogram: PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: Informed consent was obtained and a pre-procedure timeout performed.
From a right femoral approach, via a 5 French arterial sheath, the superior mesenteric artery was selected with a C2 catheter and superior mesenteric arteriograms were performed in AP and [**Doctor Last Name **] projections.
Subsequently, the C2 catheter was advanced over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7648**] wire and the right colic branch selected.
Magnification arteriography was performed.
The C2 catheter was then exchanged for a 5 French [**Last Name (un) 3056**] catheter and the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] selected.
The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.
However, over the course the day she required transfusion of multiple units for continued slow bleeding.
OPERATIVE NOTE:  The patient was taken to the operating room, and after satisfactory induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, she was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.
A midline laparotomy scar was carried out through skin and subcutaneous tissue and fascia.
A mesenteric lymph node was harvested for intraoperative frozen section and this was unrevealing of carcinoma.
The side-to-side functional end-to-end anastomosis was created with staplers in the usual fashion.
The TA staple line was inspected and oversewn as appropriate.
A pain pump was placed on the fascia and the skin was closed.
She underwent an ileocectomy as there was a question of an inflammatory mass in the RLQ and the positive tagged scan in the RLQ.
She tolerated the procedure well with minimal blood loss.
She was controlled on a dilaudid PCA and was started on sips on POD#1.
She was continued on a perioperative betablocker, lopressor 12.5 TID.
On POD#2 her hematocrit remained stable and she was started on subcutaneous heparin for DVt prophylaxis.
She was started on a clear liquid diet.
Physical therapy was consulted and recommended that rehab post-discharge for the patient as she needed significant assistance with ambulation.
As the patient was unsure of her home medication doses she will be discharged on Lopressor 12.5 TID.
Her daughter will bring her home medications to the rehab facility where they can be restarted as approriate.
She should see her PCP this week to review her medications and doses.
Her central venous catheter was removed prior to discharge.
Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen 5-500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain.
Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO TID (3 times a day): hold for SBP < 100, HR < 50.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Lower GI bleed s/p R hemicolectomy   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a lower GI bleed requiring 14 units of blood.
You underwent a Right ileocectomy.
Restart your home medications when you are sure of the doses.
You should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] in 1 week to have your staples removed.
