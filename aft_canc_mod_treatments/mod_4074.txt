Admission Date: [**2128-4-1**]        Discharge Date: [**2128-5-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2083-12-8**]        Sex:  F  Service:  OME   Please see the previously dictated discharge summary dated [**2128-5-10**] for prior hospitalization and hospital course.
Patient was maintained on Allopurinol to prevent tumor    lysis.
She was    initially treated as described in previous discharge    summary with linezolid, Amikacin, moxifloxacin, and    clindamycin.
However, given the fact that the organism    was identified was Mycobacterium abscessus as per the    Infectious Disease consult, they recommended discontinuing    these agents switching her clarithromycin and AmBisome as    well as vancomycin and cipromycin given the fact that she    was febrile and neutropenic at this time.
Given the fact that she continuing spiking fevers, it was unclear what the course of her atypical Mycobacterium should be.
There was debates between Pulmonary, who was consulted for evaluation of this patient given her persistent nodules, serial CT scans during the month showed that she actually had some improvement in the ground-glass opacities as well as the hilar pulmonary nodules.
At the time of this dictation, the plan was to continue monotherapy for the atypical Mycobacterium with clarithromycin and followup serial CT exams for further evaluations and possible adjustment of her treatment.
The plan was if she continued to spike high fevers and had a hemodynamic instability, plan was to broaden antibiotic coverage and possible further invasive tissue evaluation.
The    patient subsequently received doses of AmBisome during her    hospitalization to cover her neutropenic period.
The patient was covered with    AmBisome, vancomycin, and Cipro given her ceftaz allergy    as described previously for febrile neutropenic coverage.
She    was also continued on acyclovir.
Ciprofloxacin was D/C'd in favor of high-dose levofloxacin given the sensitivities of the Pseudomonas.
On [**5-13**], the levofloxacin was changed to aztreonam given the concern for rising LFTs on levofloxacin.
Once her ANC was greater than 500, vancomycin and AmBisome were D/C'd.
Once her ANC was greater than 1000, her antibiotic therapy was tailored to just acyclovir and clarithromycin.
A torso CT was performed to evaluate for an occult abscess and in the setting, aztreonam and linezolid were empirically started.
Dermatology was reconsulted on evaluation of this patient, and they recommended that this was likely due to a drug rash secondary to aztreonam and the patient was changed from aztreonam to ciprofloxacin as a result.
On [**5-26**], her ciprofloxacin was D/C'd and she was covered just on AmBisome and clarithromycin, however, further evaluation with Pulmonary and Infectious Disease consult regarding pulmonary nodules recommended discontinuing the AmBisome given the fact that the pulmonary nodules are likely consistent with either atypical Mycobacterium infection versus leukemia, and she was maintained on clarithromycin monotherapy with reimage with possible repeat CT.  A repeat CT was performed on [**5-31**], which showed stable pulmonary nodules and no interval change other than a left pleural effusion.
It likely will be that the patient will be treated with clarithromycin monotherapy for her Mycobacterium abscessus for a total course of three months to be followed up as an outpatient with Infectious Diseases.
The patient was also given inhaled pentamidine x2 one month apart during this hospitalization stay for pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis.
During her previous month    during this hospitalization, she completed a seven day    course of steroids given her failed [**Last Name (un) **] stim test.
Elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase.
The patient    had some elevations in her LFTs initially concern for    levofloxacin as she was subsequently changed to aztreonam    as described above.
This was negative by a torso CT, so AmBisome was held off,    but we initially restarted given her persistent pulmonary    nodules as described above.
Further evaluation is pending, however, her transient transaminitis and hepatitis resolved without any intervention and her LFTs trended down over the next three days down to her baseline in the 80s.
Serial    Clostridium difficiles were negative and this resolved    acutely after Imodium was started.
She received doses of vitamin K during this    hospitalization stay with a stable INR in 1.4.
This was likely thought to be musculoskeletal    and the patient received oxycodone and Morphine with pain    relief.
She was empirically treated with Heparin drip for a five day course given a positive deep venous thrombus that was noted adjacent to her right upper extremity, PICC line site.
The patient was maintained on Heparin drip as described above and her pain resolved.
At that time, Heparin was D/C'd, and the thought that these were renal infarcts was discontinued.
She was started on Morphine PCA, which was changed to Fentanyl PCA, given some dizziness and was weaned off to an increase in her oxycodone dose, and this was subsequently D/C'd and changed over to Fentanyl patch.
General Surgery was consulted, and they evaluated this patient, and they did not feel that this was an acute abdomen given the fact that her abdominal  CT was unremarkable.
No biopsy    was done and aztreonam was D/C'd, and changed to Cipro.
At the time of dictation, General Surgery was asked to consult and possibly due a surgical biopsy of these lesions.
