He was admitted to the ICU and stabilized, given lasix and bisphspohanates and IV fluids for hypercalcemia, treated with broad spectrum ABX for possible post obstructive pneumonia, given oxygen.
He had episodes of Afib with RVR, was started on digoxin and metoprolol and his HR remained between 100-110.
He was also started on a heparin gtt.
Once transferred to the floor he was noted to have a leukocytosis despite ABX, C. Diff was ruled out and this was felt to be a stress response.
His heparin gtt was stopped given his risk of bleeding.
However, his mental status continued to decline, he was unresponsive to antibiotics, and his blood pressure was marginal with IVF and he started to become anasarcic.
He then was unable to take PO medications and it was decided that he could not get chemo.
We discontinued medications except for those that would make the patient comfortable.
