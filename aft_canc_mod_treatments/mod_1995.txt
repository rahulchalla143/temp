Right epididymitis.
On the medical floor, he was found to have orchitis of the R testicle, which was treated with cipro and doxycycline given U-Cx sensitivities.
Urology c/s deemed no surgical intervention necessary and was not concerned for torsion, and recommended abx for 2 weeks (see below).
He was initially covered with vanc given enterococcus in blood that was resistant to cipro, but transitioned to doxycycline on [**5-27**] and has been afebrile thus far.
Patient had a previous urine culture with pseudomonas sensitive to quinolones, but had been treated with nitrofurantoin to which it was resistant; he was covered during his MICU stay with cipro for sensitive pseudomonas; his U-Cx also grew out Enterococcus which was cipro resistant; doxycycline was added on [**5-27**].
He had SIADH treated with fluid restriction in previous admission.
He did have a positive beta-glucan and concerning lung imaging, and thus is being treated for PCP on atovaquone being tapered down and prednisone.
