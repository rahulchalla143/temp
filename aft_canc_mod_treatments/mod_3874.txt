Patient will eventually get an abdominal port for home management of his ascites and will be tranistioned to home hospice.
GI and oncology were consulted and it was recommended that a paracentesis be obtain for tissue diagnosis.
A bedside paracentesis was performed with only 40 cc off.
Patient was then sent for  ultrasound guided paracentesis and 3L of fluid were removed.
While the staining pattern is not entirely specific, combined with cytomorphology, the differential diagnosis includes pancreaticobiliary, gastric, and colonic origins for the adenocarcinoma.
Two additional ultrasound guided therapeutic paracentesis were performed.
The second one had 600 PMNs indicating bacterial peritonitis  and patient was treated with ceftriaxone (see below for treatment details).
The third paracentesis got off 5.5 L and has 1750 PMN's.
A fourth and final paracentesis was performed and showed 13 PMN's.
He is scheduled for out-patient therapeutic paracentesis at [**Company 191**] every Tuesday and Friday for the next 3 weeks.
Plans for abdominal port placement after patient is d/c'ed from [**Hospital1 1501**].
He spiked a fever on HD 4 and became tachycardic.
He met criteria for SIRS and was started on vancomycin and zosyn for empiric coverage and pan cultured.
Vanc/zosyn was discontinued after 4 days of treatment and ceftriaxone was started as above.
The ceftriaxone was discontinued after the 4th paracentesis that showed resolution of his SBP.
He received one dose of ceftriaxone at the time of spike.
The day of discharge his temperature rose to 100.6 but on repeat measurement was 98.6 and no intervention was done.

After his first bed side paracentesis during which he received 2 units FFP, he became acutely short of breath and required nebulizer treatments and O2 by masal cannula.
Two dasy after returning to the floor, he again had an increasing oxygen requirement, sating at 89% on 4L nc and had no improvement in his oxygenation with nebulizer treatments.
He was transferred back to the MICU for monitoring where he underwent a third paracentesis with improvement in his symptoms.
He was stabilized on 2L nc and returned to the floor.
He was eventually weaned off oxygen and was discharged sating 94% on room air.
Upon arrival to the MICU the pt met SIRS criteria with potential sources including pulmonary, GI including ascites; of note was recently instrumented.
Massive diarrhea [**1-7**] aggressive bowel regimen (or infection) possibly contributing.
The patient was hemodynamically stable s/p 3L NS fluid resuscitation.
The pt was given NS boluses prn for MAP>65 and was broadly covererd with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.
# Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis: Patient developed SBP found on his second paracentesis with 600 PMN's.
He was treated with ceftriaxone.
A repeat paracentesis showed 1750 PMN's and his treatment was continued.
He was treated supportively and symptoms resolved with oxygen and nebulizer treatments.
# Anemia: Patient was admitted with a hct of 40 and developed a microcytic anemia which was attributed to iron deficency and anemia of chronic disease.
Coumadin held and vitamin K given with normalization of INR to 1.2 on discharge.
Patinet was not discharged on coumdain as he will be getting [**Hospital1 **]-weekly paracenteses.
# H/o remote CVA: Had been on coumadin as outpatient, being held in conjunction with PCP.
