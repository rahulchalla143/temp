The neck was supple with a tracheostomy clean, dry, and intact.
The percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was clean, dry, and intact.
She was initially started on vancomycin and cefepime in the Emergency Department awaiting sputum culture results.
When this result returned the patient was continued on vancomycin, but the cefepime was changed to Levaquin for continued coverage of Pseudomonas if that was in fact the organism found in the sputum culture.
BRONCHIECTASIS ISSUES:  As the patient has baseline bronchiectasis with an increased risk of recurrent pulmonary infections, she was continued on her outpatient regimen of Ceftin 500 mg by mouth twice per day for seven days the first week of every other month alternating with ciprofloxacin 500 mg by mouth twice per day the first week of every other month.
She was to continue taking all of her inhalers and albuterol nebulizers as needed.
Current treatment was deferred during this admission until the resolution of her acute medical issues.
It should be known that the patient receives monthly intravenous immunoglobulin infusions with the last one being on [**2142-1-10**].
DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and takes NPH insulin twice per day as well as a regular insulin sliding-scale.
On the day of discharge, her NPH regimen was increased by one unit both in the morning and at bedtime.
As she has been getting antibiotics for the past seven days for her pneumonia, we will continue her Flagyl for the next five days to help prevent a recurrence of Clostridium difficile colitis.
DEPRESSION ISSUES:  We were unsure if the patient has an official diagnosis of depression, but she seemed to be doing well on Prozac 40 mg by mouth once per day.
However, Ritalin was started during her last one or two admissions, and the indication was not clear.
TRACHEOSTOMY CARE ISSUES:  The patient has had a tracheostomy in place since [**2141-12-29**].
The indication for placing the tracheostomy was difficulty weaning from the ventilator.
She was to tuck her chin to her chest when swallowing liquids and solids.
She should follow up with Speech and Swallow therapy at [**Hospital1 **].
She should have a repeat video swallow in one to two weeks, as it was thought that her aspiration to thin liquids was likely due to fatigue, and this should improve with rehabilitation.
She is also to continue her tube feeds as they are at goal until a Nutrition consultation is done with recommendations for how to combine her oral intake with her tube feeds recommendations.
The goal is for her to be taking adequate oral intake so that the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube can be reversed.
