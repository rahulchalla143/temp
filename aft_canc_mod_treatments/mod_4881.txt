# Critical AS: valve area = 0.4, peak gradient 100.
Patient not deemed a surgical candidate for surgery due to her co-morbidities therefore scheduled for core-valve on [**6-13**].
Patient with uneventful pre-operative course.
TTE prior to procedure 55%.
An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is present.
Patient was continued on metoprolol, digoxin.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Pre-opertively patient had been on coumadin which had been transitioned to lovenox and subsequently switched to fondaparinaux.
-- RATE CONTROL: Patient rate controlled with digoxin and metoprolol.
-- ANTICOAGULATION: Pre-opertively patient had been on coumadin which had been transitioned to lovenox and subsequently switched to fondaparinaux Patient initially anticoagulated post-procedure with heparin IV however due to concern for HIT, heparin was stopped and argatroban started.
HIT antibody returned negative and patient restarted on heparin gtt on [**6-20**].
Patient started on broad spectrum antibiotics and decision made to aggressively hydrate with IVF and transition pressure support to levophed and vasopression.
On [**6-21**], the patient became increasingly hypotensive requiring pressor support with levophed, vasopressin, and dopamine.
Differential diagnosis at that time included sepsis, DIC medication side effect and HIT.
Concern for HIT prompted transition to argatroban and send out of the HIT antibody.
Patient with elevation in creatinine and decrease in urine production post-corevalve.
Patients kidney function was monitored daily, medications were renally dosed.
Cr stabilized around 4.8 and urine output improved transiently on a lasix gtt before the patient began to deteriorate and urine output again declined.
Patient with hypotension s/p procedure necessitating augmented pressure support with neo.
Additional vasoconstriction in setting of neo in a patient with scleroderma likely resulted in aggravated peripheral vasoconstriction of left hand.
LFTs stabilized and began to slowly trend down after initiation of broad spectrum antibiotics and normalization of blood pressure.
Left cath undertaken in [**4-/2119**] as part of work-up for core-valve demonstarted left dominant system with singel vessel disease: ~50-70% lesion in OM1.
Continued on ASA 81 as well as BB.
Pateint with history of extensive interstitial pulmonary fibrosis secondary to to amiodarone exposure vs scleroderma vs radiation injury (got radiation for breast cancer in the past.
Per chart biopsy, baseline home oxygen 2-3L.
Pre-procedure chest CT and severe pulmonary HTN on RHC which showed PA systolic pressure of 80mmHg in the presence of nopmal wedge pressure (16mmHg).
Post-extubation patient continued on home nebulizer treatments.
No systemic therapy was started.
Patient continued on PPI for treatment of GERD .
There was concern for mesenteric ischemia post-procedure because of complaints of abdominal pain, and TPN was started.
The decision was made to transition the patient to comfort measures only.
She passed away shortly after pressors were discontinued on the morning of [**2119-6-22**].

This was in the setting of having received a percutaneous aortic valve replacement on [**2119-6-13**].
