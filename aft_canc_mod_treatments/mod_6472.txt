Brief Hospital Course: 33F with metastatic melanoma with leptomeningeal disease, BLE weakness and loss of sensation now presents with frontal headache, nausea, and vomiting, found to have  likely hemorrhagic transformation of 2 known brain metastases on CT head.

She was converted to PO morphine liquid (as she preferred it to her home oxycodone) and was discharged on a regimen of oxycontin 10mg [**Hospital1 **] for basal pain control and morphine liquid 5mg PO Q4hrs PRN for breakthrough (pt also continued on oxycodone by family request but warned against using both PRN oxycodone and PRN morphine for concern of increased risk of sedation and respiratory depression).
A foley was placed and she was continued on her bowel regimen of senna and colace with daily PR dulcolax (she had concerns about straining for urination and bowel movements as a cause of increased intracranial pressure).
She continued a short course of radiation treatments to her spine which was discontinued on initiation of vamurefanib therapy.
