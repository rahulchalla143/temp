3L of ascites were drained at surgery and EBL was 500 ml.
Overall she tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications observed, though her post-op course was notable for brief ICU monitoring for fluid shifts.
Her catheter was discontinued and she was able to void easily.
Anticoagulants were held after procedure but she continued on nodal agents with good rate control.
Coumadin was restarted on [**4-17**] with a Lovenox bridge; on the day of discharge her INR was noted to be 2.7 on 2.5mg Coumadin daily.
She also was restarted on home statin.
# Diabetes mellitus: Her home regimen was NPH 30am and 10QHS with Humalog 5 at breakfast, 2 lunch, 2 at dinner.
Post-op she was started on an insulin sliding scale with goal to keep values <175.
These were gradually decreased as her glucose control was excellent, and she was discharged on only NPH 24units in the morning with a humalog sliding scale for meals.
She did initially have low urine output that resolved after fluid boluses.
She was given Lasix twice after blood transfusions.
# Urinary urgency: Her home oxybutinin was held, and could be restarted as an outpatient if this problem re-presents itself.
