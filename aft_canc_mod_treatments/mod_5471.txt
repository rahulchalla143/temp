Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2121-6-6**] - temporary hemodialysis line placement.
[**2121-6-18**] - tunneled hemodialysis line placement.
At the time, only groaning to deep noxious stimuli, BP 70s, transported via ambulance to OSH, where he was intubated upon arrival for decreased level of consciousness and vomiting/aspiration.
At OSH given 5L and dopamine for hypotension, Nadir SBP 62.
Noted to be subtherapeutic on dilantin and given a one gram load.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, where he continued to receive 7L NS, and was started on levophed for additional pressor support.
s/p Craniotomy GERD MRSA  Social History: Lives with wife, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 5395**], in [**Name (NI) **].
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed with global hypokinesis and akinesis of the infero-lateral, inferior and infero-septal segments.
Initially, pt was treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation (ultimately +31L), and pressor support (levophed + vasopressin), which were weaned off completely by [**2121-6-5**].
The etiology of shock was felt likely secondary to seizure (given history of recent radiation therapy for meningioma at [**Hospital1 112**]), resulting in prolonged hypotension, which subsequently resulted in ARF (creatinine=1.6->5.2 ), STEMI (troponin peak=7.97), rhabdomyolysis (ck=96,400), and hypoxia (ABG=7.29/34/60) requiring ventilatory support.
Initial fluid support included bicarb in order to alkalinize the urine, however pt's urine output was minimal (<10cc/hr), resulting in progressive volume overload.
Pt was treated with aspirin, b-blockade was deferred due to hypotension requiring 2 pressors.
Pt was followed by cardiology who recommended catherization prior to discharge.
Pt was empirically begun on vanco/ceftaz/flagyl, and flagyl was d/c'd once cultures returned.
By [**6-5**], pt had been weaned off all pressors and maintaining stable SBPS in 90s.
Troponin and CK/AST/ALT were trending downward.
Creatinine was continuing to rise, and UOP did not improve with lasix 200mg IV + 250mg diamox.
A temporary hemodialysis catheter was therefore placed, with plan for dialysis on [**2121-6-6**].
Ventilator support was gradually weaned from AC to PS 5/5 with stable O2 sats, and plan was for extubation [**6-6**] or [**6-7**] after removal of some fluid with hemodialysis.
1) Resp failure   Respiratory failure improved on abx (see below) and after trial of PS, pt extubated [**2121-6-15**] on rounds and tolerated on 1 L face mask and then 4L NC.
[**6-3**] sputum had GNR speciated as Ecoli and MSSA, both sensitive to Levofloxacin.
Started [**2121-6-14**] on Vanc and Zosyn for VAP after [**6-13**] sputum grm stain showed 4+ GN diplococci and due to inc secretions.
3) LUE paralysis   Non-contrast head CT ([**6-9**]) was negative for new process.
Continued to be oliguric and HD performed almost daily.
