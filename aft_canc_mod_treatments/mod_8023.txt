**FINAL REPORT [**2152-12-26**]** Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2152-12-26**]): ENTEROCOCCUS FAECIUM.
Daptomycin 3 MCG/ML.
FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
Cefazolin interpretative criteria are based on a dosage regimen of          2g every 8h Piperacillin/tazobactam sensitivity testing available          on request.
M with h/o recently diagnosed metatstatic pancreatic cancer s/p multiple ERCPs and stent placements over past few months who presented with lethargy and mental status changes.
Treated with pip/tazo and vancomycin, then unasyn, then daptomycin & Ceftriaxone as sensitivities of bacteria became available.
On [**2151-12-19**] pt underwent an [**Date Range **] and during the procedure two plastic stent removed.
Metal stents were placed.
During the procedure patient began vomiting and required intubation for airway protection.
Subsequent imaging revealed hepatic abscesses for which patient underwent percutaneous external drainage on [**2152-12-22**].
Patient was changed to Daptomycin and Cefepime ultimately with PICC placed on [**2152-12-28**].
# Metastatic pancreatic cancer: Underwent a biopsy of subcutaneous nodules at site of RUQ surgical sutures which were thought to be the source of pain as an outpatient.
After further discussions with the patient's son and health care proxy on [**2152-12-28**] the patient will not be transferred to an intensive care unit but care will be focused on his symptoms should he become acutely ill. .
No role for colonoscopy at this point given palliative approach and his debilitation.
ASA was discontinued in this setting.
Transfused 4 units PRBCs total all with appropriate response.
# UE Edema: Developed in setting of fluid resuscitation, now resolved.
Plan to continue PPI [**Hospital1 **], change diet to liquids and mechanical soft.
Was on oxycontin on admission which was held because of MS changes.
Changed to oxycodone 5.0 mg q6hrs and increased prn dose 5-10mg because patient does not reliably ask for prn pain medication.
# Transaminitis: ALT and AST fell after [**Hospital1 **] and stent replacement but alk phos continues to slowly rise likely due to disease progression.
He is assymptomatic and further work up is not appropriate at this time, since his biliary obstruction is stented and he has percutaeous drainage of abscesses.
Given the palliative goals of care, his finger sticks have been decreased to [**Hospital1 **] and insulin sliding scale has been discontinued.
FEN: Soft solids, diabetic diet .
No ICU transfer  # TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - ongoing GI blood loss requiring periodic transfusion - rising alk phos, likely progressive pancreatic cancer - transitioning to a more palliative approach to his care, but still getting IV antibiotics for bacteremic cholangitis with hepatic abscess formation requiring biliary drainage.
