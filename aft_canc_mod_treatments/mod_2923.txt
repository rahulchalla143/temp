Left mainstem tumor (B-D):    Poorly-differentiated non-small cell carcinoma, favor adenocarcinoma, with extensive necrosis.
Clinical:  Airway obstruction; endobronchial biopsy and left mediastinum tumor.
Part 2 of the specimen is additionally labeled as "left main stem tumor" and consists of multiple fragments of hemorrhagic shiny tissue that measure in aggregate 4 cm x 3.6 cm x 0.5 cm.
It is entirely submitted in cassettes B-D.  BRONCH: OPERATIVE REPORT  [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] Signed Electronically by [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] on [**Doctor First Name **] [**2112-3-24**] 11:09 AM   Name: [**Last Name (LF) **], [**Known firstname **] Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 61526**] Service:  MED Date:  [**2112-3-23**] Date of Birth:  [**2039-11-7**] Sex:  M Surgeon:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], [**MD Number(1) 19187**]  PROCEDURE: 1.
Indications and possible complications to the procedure were explained to the patient, after which he was brought to the operative theater number 12.
Once an adequate level of anesthesia was reached, the patient was intubated easily with a bronchoscope 12-13mm and thorough examination of the tracheobronchial tree was done flexibly.
The rigid scope was advanced into the left mainstem and under direct vision, using the rigid forceps, biopsy and tumor excision was done.
Tumor destruction was also done with Argon plasma coagulation and hemostasis was accomplished.
His baseline O2 sat is probably in the high 80s-low 90s, and so his oxygen was titrated to that.
They excised the tumor and destroyed it with APC, wiht resultant patent airways (did not require a stent.)
After the procedure he was extubated in the OR without complication.
He was treated with levofloxacin and metronidazole for his post-obstructive pneumonia, for a total 14 day course (last day will be [**2112-4-1**].)
He was continued on atrovent and albuterol nebulizers as well as a salmeterol inhaler.
He has been stable on 6 L NC and occasoianally deasturates and needs a NRB facemask.
He was fluid resuscitated, vancomycin was added to the levofloxacin and metronidazole, and begun on dopamine.
He was weaned off the dopamine on [**3-22**].
By the day of transfer back to the VA, he was actually hypertensive in the 140s-150s, and was restarted on his home regimen of Atenolol.
He was not given an ACE due to his renal failure.
He continued to require IV fluid boluses for a low CVP (1-5 range).
Hx of ischemic cardiomyopathy:  His ACE was held due to renal failure.
He was restarted on his atenolol once his bp stabilized.
He was continued on his atorvastatin.
Endocrine: He was kept on an insulin sliding scale.
Electrolytes:  He developed hypernatremia to 155 after he was given Lasix and put out 3 liters in a day.
