The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for close hemodynamic monitoring, and was immediately transfused two units of packed red blood cells.
[**Hospital1 **]-cap electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully.
The patient was followed with serial hematocrits every four hours through the evening of admission, into hospital day number one, during which time the patient required two additional units of packed red blood cells to be transfused, resulting in a hematocrit of 27.3 on the morning of hospital day number one.
Given this inappropriate response to four units of packed red blood cells transfused, the patient received continuous every four hour hematocrit checks through hospital day number three.
The patient subsequently required two additional units of packed red blood cells and was noted to demonstrate a stable hematocrit of 31.8 on hospital day number three.
Given the stabilization, the patient was subsequently transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on the evening of hospital day number three, with instructions for continued hematocrit monitoring.
Serial studies conducted throughout the course of hospital day number three and four demonstrated stabilization of the patient's hematocrit at approximately 31.7.
His intravenous fluids were discontinued, and he was transitioned to oral medications.
A follow-up evaluation by the Gastroenterology service noted the patient to be doing well, in stable condition, and advised continued oral Protonix therapy twice daily for at least eight weeks, with once daily therapy thereafter.
Pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth twice a day 2.
Sucralfate 1 gram by mouth four times a day  DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to observe a planned non-acidic diet, Sucralfate 1 gram by mouth four times a day, pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth every 12 hours.
