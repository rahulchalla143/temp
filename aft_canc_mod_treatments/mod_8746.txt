Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
We felt that this was most likely a lung cancer of some type, and she might benefit from resection even given her advanced age.
She underwent a preoperative evaluation including attempted snipping of her carotid artery by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1132**] here.
She was placed on aspirin and Plavix at that time.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Her medications preoperatively were Plavix, aspirin, Hydrea, Levoxyl, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol.
The patient underwent the above-mentioned procedure on [**2184-9-13**].
For the first two postoperative days, she was monitored in the Postanesthesia Care Unit for some (1) respiratory lability and (2) relative hypotension requiring [**Name (NI) 103585**] drip at low-to-moderate doses to maintain her blood pressure.
She was slowly weaned from ventilatory support by approximately postoperative day nine, and she was extubated.
She was made nothing by mouth and treated with nutrition alternatives.
She was treated with prophylactic antibiotics.
However, increasingly over the next one to two weeks, this was felt actually to be related to withdrawal of her Hydrea medication for polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
Because of intermittent left lower lobe collapse and effusion on that side, Interventional Radiology was consulted and placed a small drain in the left pleural space on postoperative day fourteen for effusion.
At the end of [**Month (only) 359**] (around [**9-30**]), Gastroenterology was consulted for placement of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
She had an acute decompensation around [**10-1**] or [**10-2**], and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was deferred for a later date.
Cardiology was involved in her management, and pressors were needed to support her blood pressure.
At this time, the treatment recommended was maintaining her blood pressure at a higher rate; and this was done with a dopamine infusion.
By [**10-13**], the patient was showing improvement with Physical Therapy, and Speech and Swallow evaluation showed significant improvement and no evidence of aspiration, and she was placed on a diet with aspiration maneuvers as described by the Speech Therapy Department.
She was eventually started on prophylactic antibiotics, but on [**10-14**] the patient had an acute decompensation of an extremely severe nature.
Her hemodynamics became progressively/rapidly decompensated, and fluids and pressors were necessary for support.
Immediately, invasive hemodynamic monitoring lines were placed including a Swan-Ganz catheter that was consistent with septic physiology.
Aggressive treatment was performed at this time to optimize her cardiac, respiratory, pulmonary, and renal function.
We agreed that aggressive management would continue to see if she showed dramatic improvement.
At this time, withdrawal of support was initiated and comfort measures made, and the patient expired.
