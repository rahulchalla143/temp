Admission Date:  [**2170-12-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2170-12-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2109-3-6**]     Sex:  M  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old gentleman with past medical history significant for COPD, bullous emphysema, pulmonary embolus, chronic thromboembolic disease, pulmonary hypertension, and atrial fibrillation who presented from [**Doctor Last Name **] House with a one day history of increased shortness of breath, bilateral lower extremity edema and facial swelling.
Initially was treated as a CHF exacerbation on a Nitro drip and Lasix; eventually required Bi-PAP because of continued trouble with breathing.
The patient was stable on Bi-PAP and was not intubated and was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
From records from [**Hospital1 2025**] noted to have pulmonary embolus a year ago and was evaluated at [**Hospital1 2025**] for pulmonary hypertension, chronic thromboembolic disease and was started on anticoagulation at that time.
The patient has history of COPD with bullous emphysema on two liters nasal cannula at home, history of hypertension, history of prostate cancer just followed by PSA's, no intervention yet.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 61-year-old gentleman with past medical history of chronic thromboembolic disease, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with bullous emphysema, history of prostate cancer, atrial fibrillation, who presents with acute on chronic pulmonary embolism while on therapeutic Coumadin.
Pulmonary embolus:  The patient had a pulmonary embolus while on therapeutic Coumadin and was considered a Coumadin failure.
The patient was initially started on Heparin drip and transitioned to a Lovenox regimen [**Hospital1 **].
The patient's Lovenox regimen was adjusted per his factor X-A level and was eventually maintained on an 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] dosing of Lovenox.
However, two days following admission the patient had an acute episode of hypotension, hypoxia and tachycardia and as was considered less hemodynamically stable, the patient received treatment with TPA, no evidence of bleed or neurologic change after this, however, patient's oxygenation remained stable in the 80's to 90's as had been prior to episode of acute decompensation.
As patient continued to require increased oxygen requirements on non rebreather and eventually to C-PAP.
Patient was tried on a regimen of inhaled Nitric oxide to help pulmonary vasodilation.
However, this was a short-term therapy and patient was started on Viagra to help bridge pulmonary vasodilation until Nitric oxide could be weaned off.
However, patient remained on the Nitric oxide for around 72 hours before it was titrated off and this was turned off (was on a 25 mg q 8 regimen of the Viagra) and was then requiring C-PAP ventilation to maintain oxygenation.
During the course of his stay, the patient had repeated echocardiograms including echocardiogram with a bubble study which did show improvement in his PR gradient from 97 on admission to 84 as was noted from his previous discharge summaries from [**Hospital1 2025**], was noted to have elevated PA pressures on echocardiogram a year prior to this and had chronic history of pulmonary hypertension.
Echo study also showed severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis which was also consistent with previous echocardiogram reports from his [**Hospital1 2025**] hospitalization including a right heart catheterization during that hospitalization.
Eventually patient continued to not tolerate the C-PAP mask and ventilation and continued to pull off the mask because of discomfort.
Eventually patient had family meeting including his nieces and his PCP and the primary team and as concerns for chronicity of patient's condition and limited options in terms of treatments secondary to his large clot burden and large pulmonary artery pressures, the patient's code status was changed to DNR, DNI.
Patient was agreeable to this but wanted to continue to have aggressive management as tolerated.
The patient was continued to be treated with C-PAP machine as tolerated, however, eventually patient was refusing this secondary to discomfort and was maintained on a non rebreather mask as tolerated.
Eventually as patient continued to remain hypoxic, patient was started on prn doses of Ativan and Morphine for increased agitation and discomfort and eventually patient's nieces were called back and decision was made to move toward comfort measures on a Morphine drip.
Eventually patient was transitioned from a non rebreather mask to nasal cannula which was more comfortable and eventually at 5:55 p.m. the patient's saturations decreased and patient was pronounced dead secondary to respiratory failure, secondary to chronic pulmonary hypertension, secondary to chronic thromboembolic disease complicated by acute on chronic pulmonary emboli.
