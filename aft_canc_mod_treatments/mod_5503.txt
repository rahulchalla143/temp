Imaging: CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST [**2118-3-20**]: 1.
Stable appearance of known extensive metastatic disease with ascites, peritoneal and omental implants.
Stable appearance of high attenuation components in left upper quadrant within the ascites suggestive of regions of intraperitoneal hemorrhage.
# Anemia:  Patient presented with a hematocrit of 16 in the setting of recent chemotherapy and no clear source of acute bleeding.
She was transfused a total of four units of blood and had a post-transfusion Hct of 34, suggesting that her initial Hct of 16 was erroneous.
On the floor patient had 1 L of fluid drained from abdominal port for comfort - the next day she had > 15 pt HCT drop (30.4 -> 15.7).
There is some concern that removing fluid for comfort increases peritoneal bleeding due to decreased pressure/tamponade.
Plan is to discontinue lovenox, transfuse based on symptoms only and drain ascities for comfort.
# Ascities:  The patient has significant ascites and has undergone multiple therapeutic paracentesis to relieve dyspnea and abdominal discomfort.
Patient was briefly started on antibiotics (Vanc, Ceftrioxone) for possible intrapertineal infection based on PMN 249 ([**2118-3-22**]), however culture returned negative and antibiotics were discontinued.
