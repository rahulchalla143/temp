PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  The patient had an open cholecystectomy in [**2162**].
On [**2184-1-2**], she underwent right colectomy without complications.
However, she required intravenous fluid bolus for low urine output.
On postoperative day #1, the patient continued to require intravenous fluid boluses for urine output and developed a persistent tachycardia.

The patient was started on beta blocker and ACE inhibitor for afterload reduction to optimize her hemodynamics.
The patient was also started on aspirin.
Once her hemodynamics were optimized and diuresis of fluid was initiated, the patient improved and, on postoperative day #4, she was transferred back to the hospital floor.
She was continued on Lasix diuresis as well as beta blockade, afterload reduction and aspirin.
The patient continued to do well with good response to diuresis and improved pulmonary function and was saturating well on room air and breathing comfortably.
On postoperative day #7, an ultrasound of the right upper extremity was performed, which showed a cephalic vein deep vein thrombosis, and the patient was started on Coumadin at that time for treatment of the deep vein thrombosis as well as for prophylaxis for the severe wall motion abnormality of the heart.
