Repeat radiography following diuresis recommended.
Patient was initially treated in the MICU on a nitroglycerin drip.
She was resumed  on her home BP meds (labetolol and losartan and nifedipine).
It remained unclear if hypertension was due to medication noncompliance (patient says she reliably takes all meds) versus chronic underdializing and fluid overload.
She required labetolol gtt on and off to control her BP.
She received daily ultrafiltration and hemodialysis to regain fluid balance.
She was also started on additional oral BP meds including hydralazine and minoxidil (avoided clonidine for concern over reflex hypertention if there is medication non-compliance).
Hydralazine was dosed at 25mg po BID, was briefly treated with QID dosing but both patient and her mother thought this would be difficult to maintain while outpatient.
Upon discharge her BP ranged from SBP 120-130s directly after dialysis to SBP 140-180 on non-dialysis days.
When she did exceed SBP > 200, or DBP > 120, she was given hydralazine 5mg IV with appropriate effect.
Discharged on labetolol, losartan, nifedipine, minoxidil and hydralazine.
At HD on [**10-26**] she was noted to have rigors and subsequently developed a ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII bactermia and growth from her tunnelled cath tip (after it was removed).
She was treated with gentomycin until the sensitivities returned and she was switched to ciprofloxacin.
A temporary line was briefly used and then a new tunneled catheter was placed once surveillance cultures returned negative.
She completed a 14 day course of Cipro and then the medication was discontinued.
She was treated also with Dilaudid and morphine IV for pain which generally controlled her pain.
She was started on a trial of sumatriptan for headaches which was moderately helpful, she was discharged with a limited number of this medication.
Patient will need surgical removal of adenoma in future given that hypercalcemia likely contributes to both her headache and recurrent nausea.
She was continued on coumadin in the hospital with her INR within goal range of [**2-8**].
Her coumadin was briefly held while inpatient and she was transitioned to a heparin drip in preparation for her parathyroid adenomectomy.
Once it became clear that her surgery could not be obtained while inpatient, she was restarted on coumadin.
Continued on HD and ultrafiltration.
Also treated with Sevelamer and Cinacalcet per Renal recommendations.
Continued on glargine [**Hospital1 **] and humalog with meals.
Was continuously difficult to control given erratic eating patterns, poor diet compliance and refusal by patient & mother to adhere to prescribed insulin dosing at various intervals.
Discharged with glargine 15u at breakfast and 12u at supper and a humalog insulin sliding scale.
Also set-up with VNA services given the complexity of her medical issues.
Treated intermittently with kayexelate when K > 5. .
Resolved with these interventions.
Additionally on prednisone gtts of unclear reasoning.
Patient insisted on continued drops during inpatient stay.
VNA services set-up on discharge for family support given complexity of her medical problems.
