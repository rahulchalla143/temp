She was given oxycodone 5mg Q4H PRN, which adequately controlled her pain.
On [**2158-10-26**] a therapeutic paracentesis was performed with ultrasound guidance.
She was initially maintained on 1L of daily fluid restriction, and her home Lasix and spironolactone were held in order to preserve sodium.
As such she was started on Tolvaptan 15mg on [**2158-10-25**], and her fluid restriction was liberalized.
She continued to have poor response to this so it was stopped and she was ultimately started on CVVH for removal of fluid with resolution of her hyponatremia.
Due to [**Last Name (un) **] (see below) she was continued on hemodialysis and her diuretics were stopped.
She was initially started on octreotide and midodrine out of concern for HRS but ultimately transitioned to CVVH for removal of approximately 30kg of fluid.
She was continued on midodrine and hydrocortisone to support her blood pressures during dialysis given episodes of hypotension.
Eventually her SBP stabilized in 100-110's and hydrocortisone was stopped.
She was discharged on midodrine 10mg TID.
A tunneled HD line was placed for outpatient HD which she will have on a M/W/F basis.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: Patient developed increasing oxygen requirement in the ICU initially requiring BiPAP and then mechanical ventilation.
She was successfully extubated and on nasal cannula at the time of transfer.
Cardiology was consulted who felt valvoplasty was not indicated in this patient given her multiple medical conditions and her high risk of morbidity with a surgical intervention.
She was maintained on supportive treatment for her liver disease including lactulose for her hepatic encephalopathy and tube feeds for her poor nutrition.
Tube feeds were stopped on patient and families request because they felt she was able to take in adequate nutrition on her own.
She was discharged on lactulose 15 mL PO TID and neomycin Sulfate 500 mg PO Q8H for prevention of hepatic encephalopathy.
She was also discharged on Ciprofloxacin HCl 250 mg PO Q24H for SBP prophylaxis.
The renal team discussed the importance of continued hemodialysis and emphasized the fact that no fluid had yet been taken off during her hemodialysis sessions and that this would likely be required in the future.
The decision of the meeting was to continue hemodialysis on the floor and see how she tolerates it.
