# Dyspnea / Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Mr. [**Known lastname 4223**] admits to occasional dietary indescretions leading to heart failure exacerbations, and most recently over the weekend he had chinese food.
His dyspnea improved with continued diuresis and he was discharged home on 40mg lasix PO daily.

He received IV metoprolol with  modest control.
He had recurrent episodes of HRs to the 130s and was controlled with metoprolol, eventually discharged on metoprolol 25mg TID and diltiazem 30mg QID.
