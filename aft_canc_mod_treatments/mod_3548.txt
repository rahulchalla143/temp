Right-sided craniotomy for resection.
History of Present Illness: 68-year-old right handed female who was seen in the brain tumor clinic my Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] and me after being referred for an intracranial lesion.
She was found to be a candidate for surgical resection followed by stereotactic radiosurgery.
Pertinent Results: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2149-4-10**] 5:39 PM FINDINGS: The patient has undergone right temporal craniotomy with post- surgical changes, including a small amount of pneumocephalus, at the operative site extending superiorly and layering over the right frontal convexity.
Status post resection of temporal lobe lesion with post-operative changes including pneumocephalus, mild edema and mass effect and subarachnoid blood.
Axial, coronal, and sagittal post-gadolinium imaging was obtained with axial MP-RAGE sequence.
There are blood products seen in the right temporal lobe with increased signal along the margin of the surgical cavity on diffusion images due to postsurgical change.
In the right parietal region, the postsurgical changes are identified with small areas of blood products.
Subtle enhancement is seen at the anterior aspect of blood products at this region.
IMPRESSION: Right temporal and parietal craniotomy changes are identified.
In the right temporal region, subtle linear enhancement is seen at the posterior margin of surgical cavity and in the right parietal region subtle enhancement is seen at the anterior margin of blood products in the surgical cavity.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the OR on [**2149-4-10**] for right craniotomy with excision of tumor.
She tolerated the procedure well and the only complication was dysarthria.
On POD #1 she had a bedside swallowing evaluation which they recommended thick liquid/ground consistency solids with 1:1 supervision.
Physical therapy and occupational therapy were also involved in her care and feel that she would benefit from acute rehab so she was screened for Rehab and she was discharged on POD # 4 neurologically stable.
