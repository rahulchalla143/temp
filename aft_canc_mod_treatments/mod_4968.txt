Admission Date:  [**2165-6-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-7-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2144-10-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: Status epilepticus, respiratory failure, pneumonia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Mechanical ventilation via ETT Central venous line placement PICC placement  History of Present Illness: 20 year old male with PMHx MVC rollover with traumatic brain injury in [**7-/2164**] complicated by increased ICPs (s/p hemicraniectomy), PEG placement, VP shunt, DVT/PEs (s/p IVC filter placement), pneumonia/bacteremia ([**1-/2165**]) with trach placement, difficult to control seizures who presents with status epilepticus in the setting of significant left sided pneumonia, mucus plugging and lobar collapse.
As this is his usual presentation for seizures, he was given valium 5mg at 10:05am and another valium 5mg at 10:15am.
The patient received ambu-bagging en route to [**Hospital3 **] and received valium 10mg IV before presentation to the ED without resolution of his symptoms.
He received Tylenol 650mg NG, Ativan 6mg, Versed gtt with improvement but not resolution of symptoms (left eye deviation resolved); thus, the patient was also started on propofol gtt.
Labs there were notable for a leukocytosis (WBC 13.6), and subtherapeutic phenytoin (11.3) and phenobarb (14.0).
CXR showed LUL pneumonia and thus the patient also received nebs, zofran 4mg IV and Cefepime 400mg /Cipro ??
dose/Vancomycin 1500mg around 1-1:30pm.
Copious thick secretions were reportedly suctioned out and Respiratory Therapy placed the patient on mechanical ventilation.
Prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for continuity of care and further work-up of acute critical illness, the patient received Decadron 10mg IV (unclear rationale), Fentanyl 100mg IV and Vecuronium 8mg IV X3 for irregular respirations.
He received Xopenex nebs, and O2 sats intermittently dropped to 70-85% on assist control with TV 550, RR16, PEEP 13, FiO2 100%.
Propofol was increased to 30mcg/kg/min.
At some point, Versed gtt was discontinued and the patient was continued on propofol gtt only.
CXR showed complete white out of left hemithorax with air bronchograms and concern for Auto-PEEP.
The patient's labs were notable for Lactate 4.2, leukocytosis to 15.6 with bandemia, troponin T 0.06 and low dilantin (7.0, target 13-20) and phenobarbital levels (10.5, target 20).
He received 1.5L IVF volume resuscitation.
Neurology was consulted and recommended dilantin 800mg and phenobarb 800mg loading.
The patient also received tylenol 650mg PR X2 and lorazepam 2mg X1.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is sedated with propofol, ventilated via tracheostomy and appears comfortable.
Past Medical History: No medical issues until [**7-/2164**] when MVC with roll-over occurred * Right subdural hematoma with midline shift requiring emergent hemicraniectomy for increased ICPs ([**7-/2164**]) * Multiple brain contusions/skull fractures ([**7-/2164**]) * Traumatic brain injury ([**7-/2164**]) * L1 burst fracture ([**7-/2164**]) * s/p PEG, NPO with G-tube feeds only * s/p VP shunt and craniotomy ([**9-/2164**]) * s/p Trach, now decannulated ([**1-/2165**]) * s/p IVC filter placement for DVTs --> acute segmental/subsegmental pulmonary emboli involving basal right lower lobe pulmonary arteries (Right upper lobe, apical segments) ([**1-/2165**]) * Tachycardia felt due to autonomic instability from his injuries * Pneumonia/bacteremia (BCx coag neg staph, BAL pseudomonas/coag pos staph) s/p Vancomycin and Cefatazidime X14day courses   Social History: Has been at [**Hospital 7740**] Rehab since clinical improvement at [**Hospital3 **] in [**Hospital1 3597**].
States patient was sitting up/?standing with assistance, following commands, interactive, eating ice cream, speaking a few word phrases at [**Hospital1 85128**] Rehab and recent discussion of discontinuing tracheostomy.
He has occasional twitches of his R shoulder and R arm but these are well controlled when Dilantin and Phenobarbital levels are normal.
The patient is status post tracheostomy demonstrated within the mid trachea.
Otherwise unchanged appearance of the brain with extensive encephalomalacic change, some areas of subdural hemorrhage, most prominent along the right cerebellar hemisphere and ventriculomegaly status post ventriculostomy catheter placement.
Underlying infection can not be excluded.
Percutaneous gastrostomy, tracheostomy and partially imaged ventricular shunt in standard positions.
Status post craniotomy changes.
Near complete opacification of the left hemithorax with associated leftward mediastinal shift consistent with lung collapse.
[**6-25**] eeg  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal 24-hour video EEG telemetry which captured two pushbutton activations for eyelid fluttering and was also associated with right arm tremor which had no electrographic evidence of seizure activity.
[**6-26**]/eeg  IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to the presence of occasional left frontocentral epileptiform discharges phase reversing at F3 and isoelectric at F3/C3 indicative of an area of epileptogenic cortex.
There was a pushbutton activation for right shoulder jerking and head jerking which had no electrographic correlate.
Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.
Shunt catheter traverses the left neck, chest and upper abdomen.
