Admission Date:  [**2105-1-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2105-2-5**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 545**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status, respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endotracheal intubation central venous line placement arterial line placement  History of Present Illness: 83-year-old gentleman with a h/o microfollicular thyroid adenoma and recent diagnosis of hepatocellular/colon cancer who presented to the ED with mental status changes and increasing confusion.
He also reported dizziness, weakness, and shortness of breath stating that he felt like he was going to "pass out."
He was given glucagon and D50.
The ED was concerned about possible allergic reaction from IV contrast and he was given nebs, solumedrol, pepcid, and benadryl.
His respiratory status did not improve and he was intubated for increased work of breathing.
A right femoral line was placed and levophed was started for hypotension (BP 88/47) after intubation.
Past Medical History: Recent diagnosis of hepatocellular and colon cancer, felt to have 2 different primary cancers per notes and biopsy reports Right microfollicular adenoma s/p resection 4/[**2096**].
Physical Exam: Gen: intubated and sedated, profoundly jaundiced HEENT: PERRLA, sclerae icteric, poor dentition, ETT in place Neck: moderately distended JVD Cor: RRR, no 2/6 SEM Resp: decreased BS at L base, notherwise CTAB Abd: protuberant and jaundiced, soft non-tender, + BS Ext: 2+ b/l pitting edema   Pertinent Results: [**2105-1-28**] Admission Labs WBC-12.7* RBC-3.85* Hgb-11.6* Hct-34.1* MCV-89 MCH-30.1 MCHC-34.0 RDW-17.9* Plt Ct-416 Neuts-80.7* Lymphs-14.6* Monos-4.4 Eos-0.2 Baso-0.1 .
Subsequent radiograph 8:08 a.m. on [**2-1**] available at the time of this dictation showed improvement in cardiac status and resolution of gastric distention.
Brief Hospital Course: 83-year-old gentleman with a h/o recent diagnosis of hepatocellular/colon cancer who presented to the ED with mental status changes and increasing confusion, found to be obtunded in the setting of severe hypoglycemia (FSBG 20) and intubated for respiratory failure c/b hypotension on levophed.
# Respiratory failure - unclear reason for intubation as pt was never documented as hypoxic in the ED.
An arterial line was placed in the ICU which showed excellent gas exchange and the pt was easily and rapidly extubated without complication.
Within the frst 6 hours of ICU admission, was easily titrated off of pressors with stable BPs and resolution of hypotension.
Was treated aggressively with lasix, morphine, nitropaste, and BP control with beta blockade.
Treated with ASA and BB as pt not a candidate for heparin or intervention.
Patient continued to have hypoxia in the setting of hypertension, with shorntess of breath relieved with nitropaste and IV morphine.
Aspirin ultimatly discontinued once patient made CMO.
He was placed on Morphine and Nitro paste to help improve his respiratory status.
Levsin 0.125mcg or a scopolamine patch can be added to help with secretions.
# Acute renal failure - in setting of fluid restriction and aggressive diuresis pt had acute renal failure.
Was not volume rescusitated given tendency to go into pulmonary edema.
An ultrasound guided liver biopsy was done during last admisison and initial cytology results were positive for malignanct cells consistent with a poorly-differentiated carcinoma.
Oncology communicated this to pt during recent outpatient appointment, and the topic of home hospice was discussed.
# Microfollicular thyroid adenoma s/p resection [**3-/2097**] - was very hypothyroid per clinical presentation on recent admission, discharged on levothyroxine.
Still within 6 weeks of intial therapy so TFTs not checked.
Was maintained on a fluid restriction.
# Hypoglycemia/ DM-II - was recently begun on an oral insulin secretagogue which is likely responsiible for altered mental status at home and presentation hypoglycemia in the ED.
Was persistently hypoglycemic in the ICU despite no insulin administration initially.
At that point, fingersticks and insulin were discontinued to help with patient comfort.
# Hypertension - treated with standing beta blockade.
