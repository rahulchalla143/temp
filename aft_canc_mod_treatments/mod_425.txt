He was placed on iv cefipime and azithromycin (for presumed HAP) and responded well to this regimen.
He was transitioned to PO levofloxacin.
He had some evidence of urinary retention - but difficult to assess post void residual given his incontinence.
He was placed on finasteride and may benefit from flomax or other alpha-blocker as outpt assuming he does not get orthostatic.
The levofloxacin should be completed to address the urinary tract infection.
