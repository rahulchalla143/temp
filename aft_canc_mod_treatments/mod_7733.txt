You were seen by interventional radiologists, surgeons and oncologists here who monitored you but did not do any procedures as your bleeding had stopped by the time you got here.
The following changes were made to your medications: INCREASE imatinib to twice daily START ferrous sulfate (iron) daily- our pharmacists do not see an interaction of this with your imatinib but to be safe you can take this 2 hrs after your morning medications.
START docusate (a stool softener) while you are on iron as iron can make you constipated.
STOP Terazosin for your prostate and high blood pressure as it was not needed while you were here.
STOP Amlodipine and Hydrochlorothiazide for high blood pressure as they were not needed while you were here.
Talk to your primary doctor when you follow up about whether you need to keep taking this medication indefinately.
