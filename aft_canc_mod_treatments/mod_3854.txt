She underwent lumpectomy with radiation and chemotherapy treatment.
Due to the complication of this mass and the failure of systemic therapies to control it, resection is indicated.
As primary closure will not be possible following resection, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery has been consulted for closure with a flap.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Coumadin for port access, Xeloda, Tylenol #3.
Plan is for resection of the mass.
The patient underwent resection of the    recurrent carcinoma of the right axilla closure with a free    flap and skin graft on [**2171-5-27**].
The patient was also evaluated for a dorsal splint    for the right upper extremity due to swelling in her right    arm.
The patient was fluid resuscitated,    transferred to the intensive care unit, started on antibiotics    and invasive monitoring.
She underwent flap removal and    debridement of the wound on [**2171-6-7**] for necrotic right    latissimus flap.
AlloDerm and vacuum were placed at that    time.
Her nonfunctioning port-a-cath was removed at    bedside.
She improved following these interventions and was    transferred back to the surgical floor.
Her pain is well controlled    with oral pain medications and the vacuum changes are done at    the bedside.
The catheter tip culture was    negative.
The    patient was initially started on empiric vancomycin,    levofloxacin and Flagyl.
Upon consultation with    infectious disease, vancomycin was later discontinued as    well as levofloxacin.
She was started on intravenous    Bactrim and Flagyl, followed by just oral Flagyl and    Keflex on which she will be discharged to rehab.
She was    started on Boost supplementation three times a day.
Therefore, this was discontinued and she just    remained on Flagyl and Keflex.
Her oxygen saturations were adequate    and she did not require oxygen at home.
She was started on metoprolol initially    intravenously, which was changed to an oral regimen by the    time of discharge.
The patient's pain control remained an issue    throughout her stay.
By the time of discharge, her pain    was well controlled with Percocet p.r.n.
With the vacuum changes, the    patient's pain is well tolerated on oral Percocet alone.
The patient was evaluated by physical therapy and    felt to be in need of rehabilitation due to her severe    deconditioning postoperatively.
The patient will undergo a vacuum change at the rehabilitation facility on Monday, [**6-24**], and another vacuum change on [**6-27**].
