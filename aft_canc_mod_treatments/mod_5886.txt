HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname 32416**] is an 88yF with CLL who presented to clinic the day prior to admission complaining of fatigue, anorexia, and nausea, at which time allopurinol was stopped (it had been started as initial treatment for CLL in [**Month (only) **]).
She was admitted to the floor for platelet transfusions and further workup.
Despite her reluctance to consider treatment she agreed to begin allopurinol 300 mg per day on [**5-14**].
Vitals T100.5, HR 94, RR 20, BP 102/46, Sat 96%RA General: No acute distress, thin elderly woman HEENT: EOMI, left eye with conjunctival hemorrhage, 2cm ecchymosis below left eye; multiple confluent petechiae/ecchymoses on hard palate Neck: Anterior cervical lymphadenopathy appreciated Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Heart: RRR normal S1/S2, no murmurs appreciated Abd: Soft, non-tender, no discrete splenomegaly appreciated, normal active bowel sounds Ext: 2+ DP pulses bilaterally, no edema .
However,, metastasis cannot be entirely excluded.
She was briefly on levophed and vasopressin to achieve goal of MAP>60 but was quickly weaned off of pressors after IVF repletion.
Antibiotic coverage was changed from cefepime to zosyn/vanco.
She was maintained on Ceftazidime alone and afebrile for several days.
On [**7-19**] she spike a fever again, and blood cx showed gram negative rods and yeast and her PICC line was D/C'd.
She was then placed on Meropenem, Caspofungin, Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin.
Received one bag of platelets on the floor prior to transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
She received platelet transfusions approximately QOD while on the floor for platlet counts <15K.
She was given 10mg IV lasix and was net negative overnight.
- continue to monitor O2 sat - low threshold for more diuresis, pt is likely volume overloaded given aggressive fluid repletion on transfer to ICU .
ABG following line placement (pt.
was in trendelenberg) revealed respiratory acidosis and is likely [**12-29**] to position for central line given her known right hemidiaphragm paresis and raised hemidiaphragm.
# Hypercarbia: As above, likely in the setting of trendelenberg position for line placement and her probable paralyzed right diaphragm as no underlying pulmonary process, COPD to suggest as a cause and not hypoxic.
Given septic, will check mixed venous O2 sat and transfuse as needed to maintain hct >30 if O2 sat <70%.
Received additional 3u prbcs for hct 21 with goal > 30.
Likely represented hypovolemic hyponatremia as urine lytes c/w prerenal/hypovolemic state and sodium has since normalized with aggressive IVFs.
Lipitor 10mg daily Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily Fosamax 70mg weekly Calcium Allopurinol 300mg daily (d/c'd [**2198-7-4**]) .
