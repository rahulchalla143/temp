A left axillary-extremity bypass appears patent.
If clinically warranted, correlation with cross-sectional imaging might be considered.
A right-sided PICC line has been placed, seen to terminate overlying the right atrial contours.
While the ducts could be opacified and appeared normal in caliber, they could not be securely accessed for further intervention.
Uncomplicated ultrasound-guided placement of a cholecystostomy tube.
Brief Hospital Course: 81M with history of AAA s/p repair presenting with chest/abd pain x 2d with labs and imaging consistent with pancreatitis.
Ischemic pancreatitis initially considered due to significant vascular history; however, improved with fluid resuscitatation.
Autoimmune pancreatitis ruled out given normal IgG panel.
On [**7-8**] he developed fever and CT scanning noted air with an area of pancreatic necrosis concerning for infection; he was started on meropenem/flagyl for infected necrotizing pancreatitis and continued for a full 14 day course.
After discontinuation of antibiotics he was never febrile or developed a WBC count.
ERCP was performed for stent placement but was unable to access the ampulla due to extensive duodenal edema.
Therefore IR was consulted for percutaneous biliary drain placement; they were unable to place this drain and so defaulted to a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube.
After tube placement his bili (which peaked at ~12) and LFTs/lipase downtrended back to normal and remained normal after starting oral feeds.
The drain initially had ~1L per day output which tapered off to ~100-200cc daily, suggesting (per GI) that his duodenal edema had resolved and the ampulla was no longer extrinsically compressed or obstructed.
The drain needs to remain in place until he is evaluated by pancreaticobiliary surgery as an outpatient, who will determine drain removal and cholecystectomy timing.
He had a dobhoff tube placed which was advanced endoscopically into the proximal jejunum; tube feeds were started ATC and continued to discharge.
# Volume overload: due to volume resuscitation for severe pancreatitis, patient has developed extensive third spacing of fluid including ascites, pleural effusions (initially had O2 requirement, no longer) and extensive anasarca with pitting edema throughout.
He was placed on daily lasix 20mg IV for goal diuresis 1L net negative daily; IV was utilized throughout due to concern of bowel edema and poor PO absorption.
He should receive standing lasix IV daily with daily chemistry panels until his edema has improved.
# Peripheral vascular disease: noted with complicated history from AAA repair that clotted off requiring conversion to an axillobifemoral bypass graft that is high risk for clot.
He was on coumadin which was allowed to downtrend as he remained coagulopathic.
As above, when he was noted to have hemorrhagic conversion of his pancreatitis his INR was reversed with IV vitamin K and his anticoagulation was managed with a heparin drip up until the day of discharge.
He was given coumadin 2 days prior to discharge (home dose 6mg) and will need to continue heparin bridge with goal PTT 60-90 until his INR is [**1-25**] for 48 hours, at which point he can be maintained on coumadin only.
Warfarin was initially held.
By [**2143-7-1**], the INR was 2.8, and warfarin was restarted; once again became supratherapeutic and warfarin was held prior to surgery, transition to heparin drip on [**2143-7-7**] when INR was 2.3.
This was then turned off when he became coagulopathic again; he was finally reversed with IV vitamin K after hemorrhagic pancreatitis was noted on MRCP on [**7-13**].
# DM: at home on GlipiZIDE 5 mg PO QHS and GlipiZIDE 2.5 mg PO QAM.
This was initially held, and paitent was placed on insulin sliding scale.
Due to his worsening pancreatic function, he required escalating doses of insulin eventually stabilizing on 34u lantus daily with an aggresive sliding scale.
Chronic Diagnoses # HTN: at home, on home Lisinopril 20 mg PO DAILY and Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5 mg PO BID.
Metoprolol was restarted prior to discharge.
# HL: at home, on Atorvastatin 10 mg PO DAILY.
Transitional Issues # Communication: Patient, son [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 76393**] # [**Name2 (NI) 7092**]: Full (confirmed) - percutaneous cholecystostomy tube to remain in place and course dictated by pancreaticobiliary surgery - cholecystectomy at some point to be determined by surgery - ongoing heparin bridge to coumadin, goal INR [**1-25**] for bypass graft - ongoing gradual diet advancement with continuation of tube feeds till regular low fat diet is acheived without abdominal symptoms or LFT/lipase elevation - ongoing evaluation for insulin requirement - restarting home blood pressure medications when more medically stable and required - daily diuresis with IV lasix for goal of -1L net negative - pancreatic cyst noted on initial MRCP - will need repeat in 6 months.

You had a very protracted course with multiple complications from your pancreatitis, including necrosis and hemorrhage.
You were treated with IV fluids, antibiotics, anticoagulants and with a feeding tube.
You will have this tube removed when you are tolerating a full diet.
You will also have your PICC line removed when you do not need heparin any longer.
