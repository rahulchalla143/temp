Past Medical History: nephrolithiasis 5.5mm R s/p Ureteral stent [**2125-9-26**]-complicated by urosepsis as above Urinary retention as complication of above Uterine fibroids s/p D&C c section X2 Vagianal HSV    Social History: Lives at home with boyfriend [**Name (NI) **].
Fe 13, TIBC 200, Ferritin 180 .
OSH Ucx on [**9-19**] with Ecoli OSH UCx [**10-16**] NTD (confirmed on [**10-19**]) OSH blood Cx [**10-16**] X2 NTD (confirmed on [**10-19**]) .
Abnormality in the right lower pole as described above is likely a sequela from prior percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement.
Brief Hospital Course: Briefly, 45year old female who is otherwise healthy was found to have obstructing kidney stone in [**9-12**], which was then complicated by UTI and hydro requiring cystoscopy with stent placement [**9-26**], found pus, developed florid urosepsis (wbc 40, bandemia), UCx Ecoli, Rx Iv Abx in ICU then d/c'd [**10-4**] with bactrim, completed course.
Seen again at OSH ER [**10-11**] with new fever/abd pain, had urinary retention, mildly dirty UA, got IV levaquin X3days, then d/c [**10-14**] on bactrim and foley.
CT nothing acute, stent in place, no perinephric abcess, etc.
Other infectious w/u with CXR, blood cx, flu, echo negative.
Given her improvement with meropeneum and presumed failure with bactrim and allergy to fluroquinolones and PCN, decision made to complete 14days with ertapenum (day [**4-13**] on discharge).
this will be after completion of her Abx and the hope is that she can have more definitive treatment by removal of the stone and stent at that time.
She is told not to have any decath trials until her stone/stent issue has resolved given high risk for repeat infeciton in case of retention.
45year old female with complicated recent urological history with obstsructing stone s/p stent [**9-26**] complicated by urosepsis, then urinary retention and recurrent [**Hospital **] transfered from OSH with fevers/hypotension, presumed urosepsis.
-continue meropenem for now, day [**4-17**]-->will give a dose of Ertepenum before d/c to make sure tolerates.

Possible related to bactrim but wouldnt have expected sepsis picture with drug fever.
S/p vanc [**10-16**] and [**10-17**], stopped.
may be due to narcotics patient was Rx during 1st hospitalization in [**9-12**] -keep foley in for now, will need close follow up with GU here for further management -flomax 0.4 .
