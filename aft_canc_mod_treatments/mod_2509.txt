Recently admitted from 8/8-15/[**2139**] for volume overload and fatigue with culture negative diarrhoea in addition to worsening of his chronic renal failure up to Cr 5.6 ([**2140-7-13**]) which improved with holding his diuretics and hydration and returned patient's baseline of Cr~[**2-7**].
Started on phenytoin and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management given his new onset seizures.
[**Hospital1 18**] Neurology felt this was most likely toxic/metabolic and started him on Keppra (instead of phenytoin at OSH).
His renal attending saw him and was concerned that his AMS could be due to HTN encephalopathy and is requesting that he be transferred to the MICU for aggressive BP control with a labetalol drip.

Initially continued on home regimen with IV labetalol drip to bring pressures under control in the ICU.
He was started on lisinopril which had previously been held in the setting of hyperkalemia.
He was briefly started on hydralazine which was tapered and stopped prior to discharge.
At the time of discharge his blood pressures were well-controled on carvedilol, lisinopril, amlodipine and furosemide.
Loaded with phenytoin at OSH, and then treated with Keppra.
