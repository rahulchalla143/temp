It is also VERY important that you take all medications as prescribed.
Your amiodarone was stopped because you have had no further episodes of atrial fibrillation.
Your lasix was held during the admission, as your ejection fraction was preserved and you had no evidence of fluid overload.
If you develop any further chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, please contact your health care providers or return to the ED.
