He was transferred to the oncology service and started on a morphine PCA for pain control.
He also received a PEG for nutrition.
On [**2128-8-14**] he was transferred to the ICU with hypotension and hypoxia in the setting of an aspiration event.
He was maintainted on pressors briefly.
He was treated with a 10-day course of levofloxacin.
He had a tracheostomy placed in the ICU.
It was treated with miconazole and improved, he continues to require miconazole.
Throughout his stay he complained of abdominal pain and had high residuals from the tube feeds.
He was started on TPN, and continues to receive TPN as his primary source of nutrtion.
SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA: Invasive, well to moderately differentiated.
He will need dental extraction prior to radiation.
TRACH CARE:  The patient had a brief hypoxic event on [**2128-9-22**] which resolved after suctioning and removal of a mucous plug.
Has been on morphine PCA due to poor GI absorption and difficulty swallowing.
The PCA should be continued and weaned as tolerated.
He has a G tube but does not always tolerate tube feeds.
Even while he is able to eat solid foods and drink fluids without any residuals, any tube feeds even at a very slow rate stay in the stomach.
I am not sure the explanation for this, but I think that he will just need to be on TPN until he can meet his nutritional needs PO.
He developed erythema and purulent drainage around his PEG site last week.
He was started on vancomycin and cefepime, which should be discontinued on [**2128-9-26**] to complete a 10-day course.
