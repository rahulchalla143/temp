Admission Date:  [**2101-7-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-8-5**]   Service: MED  Allergies: Iodine; Iodine Containing / Cardura / Flomax  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**] Chief Complaint: mental status changes  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Transesophageal Echocardiogram  History of Present Illness: ACCEPT NOTE: 86 y.o.
He was treated from [**6-24**] to [**2101-6-28**] at [**Hospital6 33**] for Herpes Zoster in occipital area complicated by Coag Negative Staph bacteremia due to a skin breakdown from the zoster.
He was treated with 2 weeks of vancomycin QOD with resultant negative cultures.
Work up there included: -MRI (w/o gadolenium) of cervical and lumbar spine showing bad OA but no osteomyeltitis  -Bone Scan with increase uptake in L5-S1 (prelim result) -TEE negative for vegetations -TTE showed mild/mod AS -Given oxycodone, robaxin, tylenol (QID scheduled) with improvement in pain symptoms but mild delirium On admission he was noted to be delirious and hypoxic to 72% on RA (improved to 94%4L NC).
Labs drawn prior to diuresis consistent with acute renal failure (Cr 3.3, BUN 77) and infection with 14K WBCs and 42% Bands.
In ED, patient was given Vanc 1 gm, Levo 250 mg, and NS 500 cc.
While in MICU, mental status improved with treatment of UTI, bactermia, sepsis, ARF and dehydration.
Patient with epidural abcess, continued back pain.
Crit currently stable, platelets currently stable.
Past Medical History: 1) Polyarthritis of Hips, Knees and Lower Back 2) Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma s/p radiation dx in [**2098**] 3) BPH s/p TURP in [**2096**] 4) HTN 5) Aortic Stenosis 6) Mitral Valve Regurgitation 7) Hearing Deficit, mild 8) Urinary Tract infections 9) Herpes Zoster  Social History: Widow x 2 years.
Physical Exam: VS: 168/90, 75, 22 96% rm air GEN - no apparent respiratory distres, some pain on movement HEENT - MM dry, anicteric, pupils constricted but responsive bilat, difficutly following instructions for extraocular muscle exam, well healed vesicles at the occipital area on left NECK - mild JVD CHEST - crackles at right base [**1-15**] way up, o/w CTA CV - reg rate, harsh [**3-19**] SM at LUSB -> apex and carotid, no s3/s4 ABD - soft, NT/ND, +BS EXT - +1 ankle/pedal edema bilat Neuro - A+Ox1 (only to name), A+Ox3 at ED no asterixis but mild intention tremor, ROM: LE 45 degree of passive flexion, no saddle anesthesia, no bowel, bladder incontinence (Foley).
In ED, patient was given Vanc 1 gm, Levo 250 mg, and NS 500 cc.
Patient's ARF on his CRF (baseline creatinine 1.8), hyperbilirubinemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, leukocytosis and anemia all improved during his ICU with primary sepsis treatment.
Patient was then transferred to the floor and MRI with gadolinium results came back indicating osteomyletis/epidural abcess.
Subsequently on [**8-2**] +5/5 blood cultures from admission returned MSSA sensitive to oxacillin and patient was switched from vancomycin to oxacillin.
1.Altered MS: Patient's confusion has resolved considerably with treatment of his sepsis/UTI and thus toxic/metabolic causes were largely responsible.
He is currently on a low prn dose of oxycodone/  2.MSSA sepsis/bacteremia--Patient with MSSA sepsis secondary to epidural abcess/osteomyletis (+[**5-18**] for MSSA [**7-28**]--MRI w. gad), initially treated with vancomycin for 4 days prior to culture results sensitivity indicating MSSA, now on day 4 of oxacillin and subsequent surveillance cultures ([**7-31**], 7?20, [**8-3**]) have been negative.
Oxacillin can be continued with weekly LFT's, with the consideration that elevation of his LFT's are elevated in response to his resolving bacteremia/sepsis 3.UTI - E. Coli resolved on full course of Levoquin.
ARF on CRF: creat 2.9 on admission with baseline 1.5-1.7.
Patient's anemia improving with treatment of sepsis-likely primary cause.
Thrombocytopenia, increased INR--given 2.5 mg vitamin K [**8-2**], likely secondary to sepsis because resolving well with treatment.
Follow up treatement will require oxacillin until [**2101-9-11**], an MRI 1 month from this discharge and weekly LFT's to check for oxacillin tox--consider of resolving cholestatsis secondary tos sepsis.
Followup Instructions: -Oxacillin until [**9-11**]-- --Weekly Liver function tests-- MRI in one month
