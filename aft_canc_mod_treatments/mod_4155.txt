He was started on combivent and his pulmocort was changed to fluticasone.
He was started on azithromycin to cover atypical PNA, atovaquonefor PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
Oncology History: He was diagnosed with pre-B-cell ALL in [**2166-6-17**] after presenting with fatigue, DOE, dizziness, 20lb.
Following diagnosis he underwent induction therapy on the E-2993 protocol, with intrathecal methotrexate on day 24 as per protocol.
His initial bone marrow aspiration and biopsy on day +24 showed resolution of most of his prior abnormal cytogenetics, but persistence of aneuploidy 4.
He received phase II of induction chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, ARA-C, 6-MP for 28 days.
He received intensification with high-dose MTX, followed by consolidation therapy with cyclophosphamide and etoposide (EP-16).
This was completed with the addition of dexamethasone and 6-TG in [**Month (only) 958**] [**2167**].
In [**2167-5-15**], he underwent a repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy.
The bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed karyotype 47,XYY, and no evidence by FISH of the prior mentioned cytogenetic abnormalities.
He was admitted on [**2167-8-28**] and began repeat induction with the ECOG-2993 protocol including Daunarubicin, Vincristine, Prednisone, and L-Asparaginase with intrathecal methotrexate on day 10.
The patient's course of chemotherapy was complicated by hypomania secondary to high dose prednisone, hypofibrinogenemia secondary to therapy with L-Asparaginase, neutropenic fever, and multiple LFT abnormalities.
Given that he was scheduled to undergo an allogeneic transplant with Cytoxan and TBI conditioning, he did undergo a liver biopsy to assess the degree of fibrosis as well as inflammation prior to proceeding with transplant.
Pt was admitted on [**2167-10-23**] precondition with cytoxan and TBI for an allo transplant.
Last allo transplant complicated by GVH for which he was on steroids and cyclosporin.

ALL: He is five months s/p allo transplant.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, chest tube x 3, VATS, R tunneled IJ line placed  History of Present Illness: BMT TRANSFER ACCEPT NOTE .
He was admitted recently for new onset DOE, workup up with bronchospopy which was negative for infectious cause, and discharged, on azithromycin for atypical PNA and atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis, with room air saturation in the mid 90's with ambulation.
His antibiotics were changed to Vanco, Cefepime, and Levofloxacin.
He underwent VATS procedure for definitve diagnosis between BOOP/BO vs.
Procedure went well, but post op course was complicated by chest tube related pneumothorax.
Pain has been well controlled with morphine PCA.

Lung tissue with patchy organizing and focally acute pneumonitis, with accumulation of intra-alveolar macrophages.
He initially presented wiht tachypnea and dyspnea of unknown cause.
The patient was kept on steroids as well as cyclosporine to treat his pulmonary GVHD.
VATS was complicated by a left apical pneumothorax for which chest tube was placed and the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
His breathing stabilized with chest tube and pneumothorax resolved.
The decision was made ot begin photopheresis for his GVHD and right internal jugular tunneled catheter was placed for this procedure.
He was started on treatment for broad infectious coverage (vanco, cefepime, levofloxacin, pentamidine later changed to atovaquone, voriconazole), including Pneumocystis pneumonia treatment, but had no improvement and in fact CXR showed progression of infiltrates, particularly on the right side.
He was found on the floor to have a spontaneous second pneumothorax on the left side for which chest tube was placed again and the patient was transferred back to the MICU.
The running diagnosis at this time was more likely GVHD of the lung rather than infection and the patient had been started on cellcept in addition to his steroids and cyclosporine.
The patient was extremely difficult to adequately ventillate and required paralysis in order to work with the ventilator.
He went into rapid afib poorly responsive to beta blockers that lasted through the night.
He also acutely spontaneously desaturated and was found to have a left tension pneumothorax despite L sided chest tube that was still in place and had been demonstrating air leak.
The decision was made by the patient's family that he would not want to continue treatment in this way and he was extubated on [**2168-5-22**] at approximately 2:15pm.
He was pronounced and post-mortem examination was declined by his family.
