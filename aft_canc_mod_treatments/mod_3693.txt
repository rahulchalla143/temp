Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo woman with PCV s/p mini allo-BMT on [**9-30**] , admitted with sepsis now resolved, w/ persistent diarrhea.
She had initially presented with hypotensive episode (60's systolic), which resolved after IV fluids, pressors and stress dose steroids in the ICU.
In either case, she subsequently stabilized on broad antibiotics, which were continued on admission to the transplant service.
Stress dose steroids were stopped, and she was re-started on a GVHD treatment regimen of cellcept and solumedrol as outlined below.
She remained hemodynamically stable off pressors, and off stress dose steroids.
Factors supporting a "late" acute GVHD were her recent skin changes of GVHD and precipitation of diarrhea (>500cc/day) when cellcept and solumedrol were abruptly held in the ICU.
In addition, symptoms improved following re-initiation of these meds.
The GI service was consulted, and plan was made for potential biopsy if diarrhea continued to evaluate for GVHD vs. CMV.
She therefore underwent colonoscopy as her abdominal pain and diarrhea were persistent and worsening.
POLYCYTHEMIA [**Doctor First Name **] S/P ALLO-BMT [**9-30**] - >100 days out.
Continued with GVHD medications, including solumedrol and cell-cept.
Pt's Solumedrol was ultimately changed to prednisone 20mg po daily, which can be tapered as tolerated as an outpatient.
FEN - Pt was begun on TPN as her albumin was in the 2's, and it was thought that she would likely not be able to manage adequate nutrition in the setting of continued abdominal pain and diarrhea.
Of note, she required calcium and phosphorus repletion to the point that she may need extra infusions of these, as the Ca x phos product is greater than what can be given in the TPN solution.
Pt had PICC line placed in R arm in interventional radiology on the day of discharge.
