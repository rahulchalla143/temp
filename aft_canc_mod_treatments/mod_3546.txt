She was seen by ENT on [**12-25**] who noted true vocal cord paralysis on larygoscopy and planned to have her evaluated with neck and upper chest CT for mass which was perfrormed [**1-4**].
She was treated with Levofloxacin, Solumedrol, Ativan, Seroquel and nebulizers.
She was also given a dose of flagyl to cover aspiration PNA given OSH CT findings.

The endotracheal tube is positioned above the most severe segment of narrowing.
Multiples metastases within the imaged lungs, mediastinal, and portacaval lymphadenopathy.
[**1-22**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**]: Minor cervical spondylosis with demonstration of presumed esophageal mass causing esophageal obstruction.
Within these severe limitations, there is demonstration and confirmation of the suspected small (3-mm) anterior communicating artery aneurysm.
Status post tracheal stent placement, centered at approximately the level of the clavicular heads and 2.2 cm from the distal tip of the endotracheal tube.
Cancer likely esophageal with pulmonary mets given location and smoking and EtOH history.
S/p tracheal stent for airway protection [**2198-1-24**] by IP.
Stent of esophagus by GI was considered, but GI deferred stent given proximity to aorta and pt's mental status -> patient's daughter supported decision for no procedures.
* MS changes: Patient had remained very sedated after having been off sedation for several days.
Patient later appeared to be slightly more arousable, suggesting this was due to a problem with medication clearance or metabolic derangements.
Sedating medications were held as muhc as possible.
Lactulose was also given daily (which had apparently been helpful in the past for confusion).
* HTN: BP was controlled with IV metoprolol.
Folate and thiamine were given.
Continued on outpt synthroid but as IV at 1/2 of PO dose.
* Depression: zoloft held due to NPO .
