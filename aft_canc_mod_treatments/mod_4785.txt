Posterior thoracolumbar fusion with instrumentation and tumor debulking T3-L2 2.
C6 corpectomy with ACDF C4-7 3.
C4-7 posterior decompression and fusion with instrumentation   History of Present Illness: The pt is a 69M with a 1 week h/o progressive leg weakness who was found to have metastatic disease to his spine.
T7: Marked destruction of this vertebral body with replacement and expansion of its posterior elements, in combination with substantial epidural soft tissue component, severely narrows the spinal canal, compressing the spinal cord which demonstrates faint T2 hyperintensity, likely representing edema.
T11: Extensive bone destruction with central compression, but no significant angulation; slightly retropulsed dorsal cortex, in combination with epidural soft tissue, narrows the ventral canal with no frank cord compression or definite intrinsic signal abnormality.
Very small hydromyelic central canal of the spinal cord localized to the T5 level, which may relate to the severe compression at T7, as well as the presence of a focal disc herniation at the T3-4 level.
