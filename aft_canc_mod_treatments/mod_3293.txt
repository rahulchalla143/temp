She was initially deemed unresectable due to her bulky N2 disease and was started on definitive chemoradiotherapy with Carboplatinum and Taxotere.
Because of the significant reduction in mass, she was discussed in the thoracic oncology multi-disciplinary center and the consensus of the group was to move forward with an attempt at surgical resection given her age and good health.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2150-10-11**] and underwent a left thoracotomy.
During the operation, she had severe damage to her left lung from radiation therapy and her left lung became extremely edematous and she developed hemorrhage into her airways.
Because of the inability to oxygenate her, we rapidly converted her over to a median sternotomy and prepared for cardiopulmonary bypass.
