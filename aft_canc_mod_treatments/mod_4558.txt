invasive esophagectomy on [**2180-3-10**].
In the first few days after the OR he experienced worsening renal failure which required placement of an HD line and starting CVVHD.
Over the next few days he had difficulty with Rapid Afib, requiring aggressive medical mgt with Amiodarone, Diltiazem, and lopressor.
He was maintained on a heparin gtt for his Afib and his propensity to clot off the CVVHD lines.
Howeever, his plts dropped and a HIT panel came back positive, so he was changed to argatroban and all his lines were changed out.
He continued to have multiple episodes of rapid afib with HD instability and required multiple cardioversions over the following days.
He was on broad spectrum antibiotics, and TPN was initiated.
He was taken back to the OR for tracheostomy on [**4-4**].
His pain meds were weaned as well as methadone.
His Hemodynamics improved, but he still required intermittent low doses of pressors at times.
His coumadin was restarted on [**4-9**], and he was ultimately transitioned to HD from CVVH on [**2180-4-10**].
On [**2180-4-18**], CT scan of his torso demonstrated a tracheal perforation at the level of the ET tube balloon and a loculated R hydropneumothorax.
His tracheostomy was replaced by thoracic surgery.
He remained on antibiotics at this time (vancomycin/meropenem/fluconazole/flagyl).
His pulmonary status continued to improve, and he remained stable on pressure support ventilation with minimal assistance, and he was tolerating trach collar trials.
He was tolerating tube feeds via his jeunostomy tube.
