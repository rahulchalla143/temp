Admission Date:  [**2134-10-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2134-11-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2071-4-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim / Dicloxacillin / Levofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Subclavian CVL  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 52**] is a 63-year-old woman with a history of recurrent Burkitt's lymphoma D +15 of [**Hospital1 **], who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after her first treatment for recurrence (see PMH).
She was given IVF on transport and in the ED at [**Hospital3 **].
She was afebrile, and her blood pressure responded to fluid resuscitation to 90s/40s on transfer.
She was given a dose of vancomycin and cefepime at the outside hospital out of concern for infection given her neutropenia (WBC 0.2 at the OSH) and hypotension.
On admission, there was a  palpable mass on her right chest wall and axilla.
On [**2134-9-25**] she had an echocardiogram and began treatment with [**Hospital1 **].
At that time she recieved intrathecal methotrexate and hydrocort.
On [**2134-10-5**] her LP was repeated and she recieved intrathecal cytarabine.
She was discharged with neupogen for one week with close follow-up.
Hx of Parainfluenza and pneumonia   Social History: (from OMR, confirmed with patient) Her husband has COPD and has required frequent hospitalizations.
One of her sons and daughter-in-law live downstairs with their three children.
Blood cultures were drawn and she was given cefepime and vanco and transferred to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**].
On arrival she was given 2L of fluid, 1 unit of blood, and cefepime, vancomycin, and flagyl.
She was switched to ampicillin on [**10-12**] and her PICC was pulled.
She was switched to daptomycin on Monday [**2134-10-18**] because she had begun receiving hyper CVAD part B and amp interferes with clearance of methotrexate.
Her line was pulled and her broad spectrum antibiotic coverage (started given her sepsis in the setting of neutropenia) was narrowed to cefepime, gentamicin, and linezolid.
Gentamicin was d/c-ed a few days after transfer to the floor and linezolid was transitioned to ampicillin as the patient was believed to have leukosuppression secondary to the linezolid.
She completed a 10 day course of antibiotics (amp and cefepime) from the time her ANC was greater than 1000 per ID recommendations and remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable for the remainder of her hospital course.
An LP with intrathecal chemotherapy was performed on [**2134-10-14**].
A subclavian line was placed on [**10-15**] and treatment with hyper CVAD part B was started on [**10-16**].
She tolerated her chemotherapy well, complicated by mild mucositis and the bacteremia discussed above.
She had one more round of intrathecal chemotherapy with cytarabine on [**11-4**].
She underwent MRI of her R shoulder which confirmed this finding and had 4 sessions of XRT as a palliative therapy.
Pt had CT of torso to evaluate for progression of disease, read at the time of discharge was pending but will be followed up at follow-up appointment Monday following discharge when pt will return for chemotherapy gemcitabine and vinorelbine.
