Liver Resection  WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW:  Liver resection is surgery to remove an area of your liver.
Your liver has many functions including removing waste products from your blood.
The most common reason for a liver resection is to remove liver cancer or liver metastases.
Liver resection also may be done for noncancerous liver problems.
Antibiotic medicine: Antibiotic medicine is given to fight or prevent infection caused by germs called bacteria.
Always take your antibiotics exactly as ordered by your caregiver.
Never save antibiotics or take leftover antibiotics that were given to you for another illness.
Pain medicine can make you dizzy or sleepy.
If your surgery was done to remove cancer, tests may be needed to check if it has returned.
Take a deep breath and hold the breath as long as you can.
