In addition, agreed upon empiric treatment of antibiotics for a duration of 6 weeks was secondary to patient's initial refusal to undergo more intensive and directed forms of treatment, which would include bone biopsies of existing wound sites.
Even with her guardian now in place, it was determined that to avoid any further problems/refusals with treatment from the patient, an appropriate course of action would be to treat with empiric coverage for 6 weeks.
