He was hydrated with NS and then developed fevers and was noted to have LLL opacity.
Later, flagyl was re-started.
He had frequent desaturations that were found to be secondary to mucus plugging and which resolved with deep suctioning.
His sputum cultures then grew back Coag + staph sensitive to oxacillin and vanco was switched to oxacillin.
It was felt his resp distress was secondary to pulm edema/volume overload and we was therefore diuresed with PRN lasix 40 mg.  Over LOS in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he was roughly -1.2 L.  An echocardiogram revealed the patient had deteriorated LV function and new wall motion abnormalities.
He was slowly weaned from oxygen support and by discharge was down to 3L face mask.
Aggressive diuresis was no longer pursued.
External radiation therapy for his oral squamous cell CA was resumed.
He was to continue 5 more days of levo/flagyl, oxacillin was discontinued.
In summary, this is a 71 year old gentleman with oral squamous cell carcinoma on radiation therapy who was admitted for fever and finding of lower lobe lung infiltrates.
He developed respiratory distress from a combination of pneumonia, new CHF seen on echocardiography, and mucus plugging and required a brief stay in intensive care but not intubation.
He did well with diuretic therapy for his CHF, antibiotics for his MSSA pneumonia and was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital to enable further improvement of his respiratory status.
No intubation was required.
