History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 13013**] is a 56-year-old right-handed man with history of glioblastoma, staus post resection and VP shunt, who presented on [**2103-2-6**] with seizures.
He has a history of a prolonged hospitalization from [**2102-11-14**] to [**2102-12-7**], during which time he was treated for Pnuemocystis pneumonia.
He also had pulmonary embolism initially treated with LMWH and then with an IVC filter following bleeding in his tumor bed, and suffered a PEA arrest complicated by flail chest and prolonged intubation.
He also developed C. difficile at [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **] and continues on IV metronidazole and PO vancomycin in addition to an ESBL pneumonia for which he was treated with IV vancomycin and IV ertapenem (now on meropenem).
On this admission, he suffered a 2.5 min tonic-clonic seizure at his [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **] on [**2103-2-5**] and after transfer to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital ED on [**2103-2-6**] had a further 2-minute seizure.
At this point he was loaded with 1000 mg IV phenytoin and 2 mg IV lorazepam and was post-ictal after this.
Neurolgoy was consulted and recommended pursuing an infectious workup with urinalysis and his valproic acid dose was unchanged in dose but given via the IV route due to concern for aspiartion and was admitted to neuro-oncology for further care.
His mental status improved and per oncology has been oriented to person and place with intermittent communication but now seems much better and at baseline per his relatives.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for bronchoscopy wich required pre-procedure intubation and IP noted copious ++ thick secretions on BAL which were sent for atypical and atypical pathogens.
He was given propofol and suxamethonium and plan is for transfer back to OMED once stabilised and if his respiratory status is stable.
On review post-extubation on the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], his [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission vitals were temperature 98.2 F, pulse 89, blood pressure 117/90, respiration 24, and O2 saturation at 96% on 6L O2.
Review of Systems: CVS - NO CP/SOB RS - Cough ++ with sputum + no hemoptysis or wheeze GIS - Nausea no vomiting, diarrhea 3x/day and some lower [**Last Name (un) 103**] pain as above [**Male First Name (un) **] - catheterised CNS - no further fits, no numbness, weakness and reduced mobility at baseline but not worse ES - No fevers but does feel cold and no rigors HS - No bleeding but bruises notable on abdomen but not new  Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: - [**12-21**] developed headaches and leg weakness and CT at [**Hospital3 9683**] showed right temporal lobe mass.
Underwent subtotal resection of the R temporal lobe mass by Papavassilious on [**2101-12-30**], path positive for GBM - received temozolamide chemo-radiation, followed by adjuvant temozolomide (4 cycles) - ventriculoperitoneal shunt placed [**2102-8-1**] - started Procarbazine, CCNU, and Vincristine (PCV) on [**2102-8-23**] - cycle 2 of PCV on [**2102-10-10**] - prolonged hospitalization from [**2102-11-14**] to [**2102-12-7**], during which time he had: --Pneumoncystis pneumonia --s/p PEA arrest and flail chest from compression -- PE s/p IVC filter, was previously on lovenox - he was discharged to NE [**Hospital1 **], and while there was diagnosed with C. difficile, ESBL PNA - plan was to treated with Avastin but this was delayed due to ICH Per wife has had 3 IC bleeds post craniectomy and as such has meant that anticoagulation was contraindicated.
Per C. difficile, had been treated with a prolonged course of oral antibiotics and had relapsed a few days post discontinuation of treatment whereupon this was restarted.
He has 4 siblings and one has had recent stent placement for CAD.
GENERAL:  Alert, oriented and coughing ++ white secretons requiring suction tube to clear.
Tender posterior right thigh and anterior right knee withminimal swelling right knee.
Hyperdensity in the right insular region compatible with intraparenchymal hematoma is similar to the prior examination and demonstrates interval evolution of blood products from the examination of [**2103-1-25**].
Foci of evolving blood products are also noted more inferiorly in the right temporal lobe.
The patient is status post right frontotemporal craniotomy.
A ventriculostomy catheter via a left frontal approach is in unchanged position with tip in the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
Stable position of ventriculostomy catheter.
IMPRESSION: Suggest conventional chest radiographs, when feasible, to investigate possible right juxtahilar pneumonia and azygos distension exaggerated by supine positions or lower paratracheal adenopathy.
XR HIP 1 VIEW	Study Date of [**2103-2-6**] 5:27 PM Single AP view of the pelvis and single view of the right hip were obtained.
XR PELVIS (AP ONLY)	Study Date of [**2103-2-6**] 5:27 PM Single AP view of the pelvis and single view of the right hip were obtained.
Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 13013**] is a 56-year-old man with history of glioblastoma, status post resection and VP shunt, PE with IVC filter and C. difficile, ESBL pneumonia who presents with 2x seizures to the ED and considerable problems with secretion control and thick secretions necessitating admission to the ICU for bronchoscopy and BAL.
He was treated for pneumonia in addition to empiric treatment for C. difficile, and is being discharged to [**Hospital1 **] Rehabiltiation.
(1) Hypoxia/ESBL PNA (from OSH):  Patient had known ESBL PNA and was on ertapenem and vanco at OSH.
He presented with problems with [**Name2 (NI) 84003**] thick secretions and hypoxia.
The decision was made for pt to undergo therapuetic and diagnostic bronchoscopy which was performed in the ICU with intubation and was quickly extubated.
Aggressive chest PT performed and continued acetylcysteine nebs and albuterol/ipratropium nebs.
He will be treated empirically for pneumonia with Vancomycin IV and Imipenem IV (his rehab does not have meropenem) for a total of 14 days (last day is [**2103-2-18**]).
(2) Seizures:  Likely due to known GBM with associated cerebral edema and intraparenchymal hemorrhage and with lower seizure threshold given IV antibiotics and current infection.
Also valproate level found to be low (10 on admission) and borderline phenytoin (13.2) but was not continued on phenytoin maintenance.
Continued on gabapentin w/seizure precautions.
(3) Altered Mental Status:  Most likely secondary to GBM with question of steroids impacting this and intracranial bleeding post resection and initially due to post-ictal state.
He still does get confused after receiving IV Morphine.
His narcotics were held until mental status cleared and then slowly added back pain meds as needed.
Decreased his dose of Fentanyl patch.
Continued dexamethasone 4mg IV Q12, isotretinoin (Cilastin), methylphenidate, atovaquone and fluconazole prophylaxis.
Eventually aiming for bevacizumab treatment but awaiting clinical stablization and resolution of currently PNA.
He was continued on treatment (currently on IV Flagyl and PO vancomycin) with plans to treat until 2 weeks after treatment of his pneumonia (last day is [**2103-3-4**]).
He is not a candidate for anticoagulation per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] given repeated bleeds into tumor bed.
In house he was on prophylactic heparin (5000u SC TID) and also pneumoboots were used.
He needs to continue on DVT prophylaxis.
(7) Speech and Swallow Evaluation:  After patient's mental status improved, he was advanced to PO diet of thin liquids and regular consistency solids.
He should swallow medications whole with water as tolerated, with 1:1 supervision during POs.
