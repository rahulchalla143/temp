Oral phase was characterized by mildly impaired bolus control with premature spillover with thin liquids.
Patient demonstrated penetration with consecutive sips of thin liquids.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

ABG on NRB 7.34/61/161/34 during acute episode.
Diuresis yielded ~240cc within first hour.
On arrival to MICU, pt feeling better, however, RR still ~30s, given an additional 2mg morphine with good effect.
Pt will need cardiac evaluation and stress testing once his respiratory status is stabilized.
A BB was added to his regimen for further medical optimization.
Colonoscopy did not show source of bleed, but it was felt that it was resonable to restart anticoagulation.
PE:  INR drifted down and we started a heparin drip when INR <2.0.
Patient was maintained on heparin until GIB was cleared by colonoscopy and then until therapeutic x 48 hours with INR >2.0 on coumadin.
COPD/Pneumonia: Patient with wheezing on exam and is on steroid taper for recent COPD flare.
Sputum had MRSA and with history of VRE, etc and little clinical improvement, patient was treated with 14 day course of meropenum and linezolid.
He had round the clock nebs and some minor changes to regimen in house, but at discharge restarted outpatient regimen of nebs, Singulair, Advair, and Spiriva.
He was also given rxn for mucomyst nebs.
Because of the prolonged steroid course, ID recommended 1SS bactrim for 3-6 months after final taper of steroids (instead of DS to help with INR/coumadin levels).
Hypertension: Treated with lisinopril, Diltiazem, and betablocker.
Diastolic dysfunction: required IV Lasix in the ED for volume overload.
Continue outpatient regimen and judicious IVF as needed.
CAD: hold aspirin given bleeding, re-evaluate with cardiologist as an outpatient.
Hypothyroid: continued outpatient Levothyroxine  10. renal finding: Outpatient follow up of renal finding on ultrasound.
