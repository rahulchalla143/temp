She was found to have inappropriate cortisol response and her home prednisone was uptitrated with resolution of symptoms.
During that admission it was found that she had a LLE DVT and was started on Lovenox.
Lovenox was held.
Given that pt had an IVC filter and that she was perhaps to start on a biologic therapy trial (for which she cannot be on anticoagulation for inclusion) it was decided to hold anticoagulation.
CTA was performed to look for active bleeding and showed no active extravasation and an IVC filter in proper position.
While in the unit, she was seen by the GI team who recommended preparation for colonoscopy to look for diverticular disease, AVMs, or any intervenable lesions.
# Thromboembolic disease:  Given her history of recurrent DVT/PE and recent catheter-associated IJ thrombus, she has been on enoxaparin prior to this admission.
Management of the balance of her bleeding and thromboembolic diease was discussed with pt and her family and it was decided that given her IVC filter and possible enrollment in a biologics trial for melanoma that did not accept patients on anticoagulation that she would go home without restarting Lovenox.
Struggling with fatigue felt to be secondary to hypophysitis from ipilimimab therapy, anemia, and her malignancy.
Increased doses of prednisone have been helpful for this.
INACTIVE ISSUES # Diabetes mellitus:  On levemir and ISS at home.
In house, she was continued on Lantus and ISS.

We had a extensive conversation regarding the risks and benefits of anticoagulation with Lovenox and you decided to stop it for now.
Please continue to take the rest of your home medications as you were before coming to the hospital.
