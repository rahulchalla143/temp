Right femoral popliteal bypass   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 66264**] is a 57 year old man with a history of melanoma status post excision in [**2181-7-14**], lung nodule on CXR 2-3 months ago, as well as history of deep vein thrombosis, peripheral vascular disease and hypothyroidism who transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-4**] for workup of a cold, blue right foot.
Malignant Melanoma-on back s/p excision [**7-19**] - 2 x 1.4cm lesion, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 68586**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1105**], w/greatest thickness of .5mm.
Given its large distribution relative to metastatic lesion and loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation and sulcal effacement, infarction should also be considered.
An MRI would be of further utility in evaluating for additional nonvisualized metastatic lesions as well as infarction.
T1-weighted axial and sagittal images are performed through the brain following intravenous gadolinium administration.
There is a wedge-shaped area of increased T1 signal which partially enhances following intravenous gadolinium administration involving the left posterior parietal lobe along the watershed distribution.
A repeat examination would be recommended preferably with sedation for further evaluation of the brain parenchyma.
Overall, the exam remains degraded by motion artifact and repeat study with gadolinium administration using MP-RAGE protocol would be recommended for further evaluation.
A WAND study of the brain was conducted on [**2181-11-22**], and due to changes in the parietal lesion, which was more wedge-shaped and consistent with infarct, the decision was made to reimage the brain via MRI with and without contrast and MR spectroscopy with plan to discharge Mr. [**Known lastname 68587**] to rehab and have him follow-up with the [**Known lastname **] and Neurosurgical teams.
Patient was started on Keppra but developed depressed mood.
Keppra was ceased and dilantin commenced.
Dilantin was ceased on [**2181-11-19**] due to supratherapeutic levels and suspected drug rash owing to associated blanching erythematous maculopapular rash and fever.
Trileptal was commenced for seizure prophylaxis and foot pain.
Patient was started on Aspirin.
Stroke work up showed normal lipids on statin treatment.
This showed occlusion of the distal SFA with reconstitution of an anterior tibial artery at its origin with run off to the foot via this vessel.
Prior to surgery Mr. [**Known lastname 68587**] was placed on heparin GTT.
He was cleared by cardiology, and a right femoral-popliteal bypass was performed on [**11-13**].
He was transferred to the vascular service on the day of surgery and returned to the neurology service on [**2181-11-17**].
His staples will be removed as an outpatient in the vascular surgery clinic; please call to schedule an appointment in one week.
Respiratory: Mr [**Known lastname 68587**] required oxygen via nasal cannulae to 2L intermittently throughout the admission.
It was felt that this was most likely due to Dilantin hypersensitivity.
Dilantin was discontinued.
