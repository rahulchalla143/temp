The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where she was rate controlled with intravenous Lopressor and loaded with intravenous amiodarone.
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Medications when transferred to our unit were amiodarone 400 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Lopressor 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d., levothyroxine 500 mcg p.o.

She has a niece and a son-in-law who are involved in her care.
The woman was overall a well-developed/poorly nourished white female in no apparent distress, and she was not responding to questions at the time of examination, being very drowsy having just been given Ativan for agitation.
Her SMA-7 revealed a sodium of 139, potassium 3.7, chloride 104, bicarbonate 25, blood urea nitrogen 11, creatinine 0.5, glucose of 94.
Calcium 8.2, phosphorous 2.2, magnesium 1.7.
The patient was transferred to us on heparin which was discontinued.
She was maintained on amiodarone 400 mg p.o.
b.i.d., and she was on metoprolol 25 mg p.o.
It was determined that anticoagulation would not be beneficial because the lung cancer represented a bleeding risk, so no further anticoagulation was done.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  From a congestive heart failure perspective, the patient was volume overloaded in congestive heart failure, which may have resulted in her being in atrial fibrillation because atrial fibrillation stopped on the medications and with the diuresis that was achieved.
She was gradually given hydration without recurrence of her atrial fibrillation.
After two days her telemetry was discontinued because the patient was do not resuscitate/do not intubate, and no intervention would necessarily have been done in any case based on her current medication regimen.
She was maintained on levofloxacin for a 14-day course.
HEMATOLOGY:  From a hematologic perspective, she was heparin and then this was discontinued, and her hematocrit did not go below 25 so she was not transfused.
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Again, she was do not resuscitate/do not intubate and it was determined that the patient would be suitable for being transferred to the Bay Point [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation facility at [**Hospital1 1474**] (which will be done on Friday, planned for 1 p.m.), and she would then hopefully be able to go back to her home and with some degree of services depending on what was needed after her rehabilitation stay.
