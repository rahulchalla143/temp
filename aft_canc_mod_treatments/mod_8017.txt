HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] is a 79 year old male with a past medical history significant for a non-small cell lung carcinoma with metastases to the brain status post two cycles of chemotherapy with Carboplatin/Taxol, who experienced a fall on [**9-15**] upon exiting his car and walking five to six steps.
He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for an open reduction and internal fixation.
The patient was started on an Amiodarone drip, remained normotensive throughout the rest of the case, and was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.
The recommendations per Cardiology were to continue the Amiodarone intravenously and continue to use Adenosine as needed for symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia.
The patient was transferred to the Floor and continued on intravenous Amiodarone and was started on an oral Amiodarone load.
The patient was noted to have three left frontal lobe metastases, who of which have regressed after systemic chemotherapy.
The patient is status post two cycles of chemotherapy, Carboplatin/Taxol.
During the last admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 95026**] was evaluated by the Radiation Oncology Service and was to have a stereotactic radio surgery for removal of the brain metastases.
