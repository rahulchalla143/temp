His hospital course was significant for initiation of tube feeds after failing a swallow evaluation.
Chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin, 5FU was initiated [**2108-8-11**], complicated by diarrhea, severe cytopenias, ?
On [**2108-8-19**], he received 10mg olanzapine for nausea and subsequently became very lethargic and developed fever, hypotension, acute kidney injury, and ultimately transfered to the ICU [**2108-8-20**] for sepsis and neutropenic fever.
His ICU course was significant for diagnosis of LLL pneumonia, hypotension attributed to hypovolemia [**3-8**] limited PO intake/diarrhea vs. sepsis, improvement in acute renal failure, hypernatremia.
He has had frequent atrial ectopy and PVCs and electrolyte abnormalities.
ENT planned for tracheostomy [**2108-8-28**] for airway protection during therapy, but on [**2108-8-28**] early AM, he was found to have left facial droop.
Neuro recommended starting heparin ggt, which was started [**2108-8-29**].
TEE could not be done given size/location of hypopharyngeal mass.
The tracheostomy was eventually placed [**2108-9-10**].
Anticoagulation was stopped as a result.
A rechallenge with anticoagulation failed a second time due to bleeding from his tumor and trach site.
He has subsequently been managed with venodynes and prophylactic heparin 5,000 units SC TID.
Replacement was complicated by bleeding and hemoptysis requiring ENT evaluation.
He again developed aspiration pneumonia [**2108-9-28**] and was started on cefepime and vancomycin.
Antibiotics were stopped [**2108-10-3**].
Post-op trach care was administered including airway suctioning as needed.
Tube feeds were re-initiated with additional boluses of free water given hypernatremia.
Enoxaparin was held overnight on day 1 of MICU course because of bleeding from suction.
Continued suction and humidified air via trach.
Episode [**2108-8-20**] required transfer to ICU with relative hypotension, tachycardia, fever, hypoxia, and tachypnea.
LLL pneumonia on CXR treated initially with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole due to concern for aspiration.
CXR [**2108-8-21**] and [**2108-8-26**] showed worsening infiltrate, so abx changed to meropenem with vancomycin [**2108-8-26**], finished [**2108-9-3**].
Guaifenesin PRN cough.
Started on lubrigel to maintain hydration to eye surface.
Tramadol and acetaminophen PRN.
Started on acyclovir treatment dose x10d, then changed to prophylaxis dose.
Restarted gabapentin given increased pain; will titrate up dose.
Acetaminophen and tramadol PRN.
# S/P trach [**2108-9-10**]: Complicated by bleeding, resolved off anticoagulation, now on heparin SC.
Routine trach change to uncuffed trach [**2108-9-17**].
Coughed out trach tube [**2108-9-24**], re-bled then, now resolved.
Continued telemetry for continuous O2 monitoring (hospital policy for trach patients).
- Change trach tube as needed or recommended by ENT/resp care team.
Per ENT (via laryngoscopy), excellent response to chemotherapy with a ~90% reduction in tumor size.
Unable to continue with TCF given life-threatening complications, his treatment was changed to XRT with concurrent cetuximab as a radio-sensitizer.
Caphasol, Maalox/diphenhydramine/lidocaine PRN mouth pain.
Continue daily XRT with weekly cetuximab for six weeks total.
# CVA/PFO: Left face drooping seen [**2108-8-28**]; MRI positive for CVA, likely embolic.
Neurology consulted and heparin gtt started.
Aspirin started [**2108-8-28**], but stopped when heparin started.
Heparin gtt changed to enoxaparin.
Restarted heparin gtt [**2108-9-19**] and stopped [**2108-9-20**] due to recurrent trach bleed.
Continue heparin 5000U SC TID.
# RLE DVT: Anticoagulation stopped due to trach bleeding.
IVC filter considered, but decided against.
Continued heparin SC PPx and venodynes.
# Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.7, peak 1.6, now back to baseline.
Maintain adequate hydration with tube feeds/flushes.
Albumin infusions with furosemide/metolazone effectively diuresed.
Insulin glargine dose at 6U daily.
Cover with insulin sliding scale.
# Hypertension: Decreased amlodipine 10 to 5mg daily [**2108-8-30**] and discontinued [**2108-9-13**] to change to metoprolol given ectopy.
Metoprolol dose increased from 12.5 to 25mg [**Hospital1 **].
Started lisinopril 5 mg daily [**2108-9-30**] for SBPs in 160s for several days.
Resolved with addition of metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID.
# Nasal congestion: Saline nasal spray.
# Scrotal erythema: Miconazole powder to skin.
# Pain (Port site, G-tube site, left forehead zoster): Restarted gabapentin for left forehead zoster pain.
- TITRATE UP GABAPENTIN FOR ZOSTER PAIN.
# Hypernatremia: Improved after stopping furosemide and increasing tube feed flushes.
Decreased tube feed flushes as sodium levels declined.
SIADH vs recent HCTZ/hypovol (hctz dc'd [**2108-9-28**]).
Stopped gabapentin [**2108-9-15**] to avoid sedation.
# FEN: NPO and continuous tube feeds with water flushes.
# GI PPx: Lansoprazole via G-tube.
# DVT PPx: Heparin SC 5,000U TID.
# IV access: Port placed [**2108-8-7**].
# Precautions: Fall, MRSA (positive screen), aspiration.
