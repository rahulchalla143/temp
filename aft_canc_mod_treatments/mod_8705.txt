Lingula, left, lingulectomy (A-E): Squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated, see synoptic report.
Left chest tube is in place.
Moderate, nonhemorrhagic posteriorly layered right pleural effusion with associated right lung atelectasis.
Post-wedge resection changes in the left lung including small loculated pneumothorax, minimal atelectasis of the left anterior lung, subcutaneous air, and mediastinal hematoma.
Left chest tube is in place and there is no definite pneumothorax.
Central catheter again extends to the right atrium.
Right chest tube is also seen and there is no definite pneumothorax.
Interval repositioning of the right subclavian central line which now has its tip in the mid-to-distal superior vena cava in satisfactory position.
Persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle, which may reflect changes related to recent removal of the chest tube versus a small effusion.
[**2162-12-6**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Interval removal of left apical chest tube with stable small left basilar pneumothorax.
[**2162-12-8**] CXR: Right subclavian line in lower SVC.
Small right pleural effusion and minimal right lung base atelectasis are unchanged since [**2162-12-5**].
[**2162-12-9**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No significant change from [**2162-12-8**] with continued expected postoperative change status post lingular wedge resection.
She tolerated the procedure well and returned to the PACU in stable condition.
The IP service placed a right chest tube and soon she desaturated to the mid 80's.
Over the next few days she maintained stable O2 saturations and was weaned and extubated from the respirator on [**2162-12-3**].
She required BIPAP for periods during the day and over night after extubation but that was short lived and eventually she was weaned off of oxygen completely with room air saturations of 94%.
Her chest tubes were removed without difficulty and she was much more comfortable.
Following transfer to the Surgical floor she was tolerating a regular diet and her port sites were dry.
She was evaluated by the Physical Therapy service to assess her endurance and mobility and was cleared to return home without PT services.
She was noted to be tachycardic with ambulation and lopressor was restarted.
