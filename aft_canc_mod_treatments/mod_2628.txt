20 x 13 mm subcutaneous lesion of the anterior left shoulder with internal hounsfield density consistent with air.
Fever/Sepsis/Neutropenia: Pt admitted to medicine, initially treated with treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, IVF, blood cultures were performed daily.
He was initially started on Cefepime and Vancomycin due to a history of MRSA abscess, as well as Flagyl for gram negative coverage).
Pt was also transfused 1 unit pRBC for anemia (HCt24.2, increased to 27.5).
Two days after admission he remained febrile as high as 104F, became tachycardic and hypotensive with good response to fluid boluses.
At that time, abx regimen was changed to Vancomycin, Aztreonam, and Levofloxacin (Cefepime was discontinued to do ?
Voriconazole was started for fungal coverage as well as one dose of Gentamicin.
Pt was pan cultured and sent to the OR for double lumen porta cath removal (empiric for ?line sepsis) and admitted to the ICU for sepsis management, hypoxemia and hypotension.
He was continued with aggressive fluid resuscitation (central line - RIJ -placed [**6-27**]), Vancomycin, Flagyl, Aztreonam, voriconazole were continued, Levofloxacin was d/ced due to ?drug rash and history of cipro allergy.
Gentamicin was added for double gram neg coverage.
Pt's blood pressure stabilized with fluid resuscitation and fever defervesced with Abx and Tylenol/Ibuprofen.
Voriconazole and Flagyl discontinued at that time as fevers were thought to be secondary to drug reaction vs. underlying lymphoma.
Pt was empirically covered with Vancomycin and Aztreonam.
During his stay on the floor he received his third dose of chemo during which time antibiotics were held.
Pt stabilized but remained with intermittent fevers and tachycardia.
EF on [**5-16**] = 55%, repeat EF on ECHO ([**6-27**]) = 40-45% therefore decreased likelihood cardiogenic pulm congestion, although still possibility of chemo-induced cardiac dysfunction given the newer lower EF, but could be pulm congestion [**1-19**] early sepsis w/ leaky capillaries or PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] improved with diuresis with lasix.
Pt remained tachycardic in ICU, but per patient and patient's partner, baseline HR = 100.
Therefore, ECHO was obtained [**6-27**] and r/o for structural heart abnormality as cause of tachycardia - therefore was just monitored during ICU stay.
Appears to be drug rash in nature - [**1-19**] Cefepime vs. Levofloxacin vs. related to blood transfusion (pt transfused while febrile) vs. enteroviral infection.
Therefore cefepime + levofloxacin d/ced and rash monitored throughout stay with improvement.
Pt on broad spectrum abx since admission.

[**Name10 (NameIs) **] restarted on chemotherapy s/p third cycle of [**Hospital1 **]-R. LDH later normalized to 130. .
Anemia - Pt with history of anemia - s/p transfusion 1 unit pRBC on floor.
Neutropenic diet temporarily, discontinued once WBC normalized.
Prophylaxis: heparin, protonix, pneumoboots, OOB to chair w/ assistance, patient later became stronger, ambulating without difficulty .
