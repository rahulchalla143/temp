He very rarely has nausea and will vomit with dyspnea after vomiting.
He was admitted for further management.

He had been tolerating thin liquids and ground solids before his recent left thoracotomy, Left upper lobectomy and pericardial resection for biopsy proven non-small cell lung cancer.
We repeated his video swallow after that procedure before d/c but swallow function was c/w previous exams and he remained safe for thin liquids and soft foods with extra sauce and gravy.
He was given a 10 days course of antibiotics for H pylori but was only able to take 3 1/2 days of the medication and did not finish the prescription.
My guess is that the biggest change is likely continued H pylori, as he vomited up most of the medication and stoped taking it after 3 days.
Suggest considering restarting meds for H pylori (not sure if it needs to be rediagnosed before starting meds) to try to improve comfort.
He remains safe to drink his liquid supplements, and takes 5 cans of Nutren 2.0, 500 calories each which he should be ordered for here.
We will plan to f/u with him after treatment for H pylori to see if he feels his oral and pharyngeal swallow has improved further.
Gastric biopsy ([**2136-10-3**]): Gastric antrum and body, mucosal biopsies: Antral and corpus mucosa with focal intestinal metaplasia, focal regeneration of gastric pits and minimal inflammation; see note.
The patient was administered MAC anesthesia.
Supplemental oxygen was used.
The procedure was not difficult.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.

DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7722**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7723**] Approved: TUE [**2136-11-13**] 5:09 PM  	Imaging Lab  Brief Hospital Course: 74 year-old man with laryngeal cancer and NSCLC s/p chemo and XRT, history of chronic dysphagia (to solids), and H.pylori infection presents with progressive nausea and resulting decreased PO intake.
In the ICU, he was started on heliox, racemic epinephrine and IV dedacrdone.
He was kept strict NPO and some of his meds were switched to IV form.
He was evaluated by ENT who placed tracheostomy on the day of the admission with no complications.
He was initially placed on a diltiazem drip and amiodarone infusion was also started to obtain rhythm control.
Heart rate was better controlled with amiodarone, but attempts to transition to po amiadorone were hindered by persistent dysphagia.
Patient failed video swallow study and patient had G tube placed by IR on [**10-29**].
He was then transitioned to po dilt.
Additionally, radiation oncology was consulted for palliative XRT, but again, patient positioning limited treatment options.
# Metastatic disease: Patient with glottic SCC (T3N0)s/p chemoradiation in [**2134**] and stage IIB NSCLC s/p left upper lobectomy in [**2136-5-13**].
Following surgery in [**Month (only) 116**], patient was told he was 'cancer free'.
Additionally, radiation oncology was consulted for palliative XRT, but again, patient positioning limited treatment options.
# Nausea, heartburn: Initially an attempt at H.pylori eradication was done to eliminate that as a potential cause of his nausea.
However, he was unable to tolerate sequential therapy and was taken off of it.
He was therefore started on PPI [**Hospital1 **] and given antiemetics, particularly zofran.
However, due to persistent dysphagia, he was made NPO and G tube was placed on [**10-29**].
CDiff antigen was positive on [**10-21**] and patient was started on IV flagyl.
Due to his high risk, vancomycin enemas were added on [**10-26**] as he could not tolerate po vancomycin.
PO vancomycin was added to regimen following successful placement of G tube on [**10-29**].
# Dysphagia: He has history of glottic cancer s/p chemo XRT, s/p trach with course complicated by chronic dysphagia with dilation esophageal stricture [**2136-9-16**].
Pt had an EGD approximately one week prior to admission that did not show a significant narrowing and patient had dilation with improvement and even acknowledges this improvement in the dysphagia component of his symptoms.
He was supplemented with nutren given his risk for malnutrition.
He was made NPO with TPN until a G-tube was placed by IR on [**10-29**].
He was treated with a lidocaine patch, prn dilaudid, basal fentanyl patch, and gabapentin.
Plain films of right ribs were negative for fracture.
On [**10-23**], he again developed RVR and attempts to control with IV nodal agents resulted in decreased blood pressure.
He was transferred to the ICU where diltiazem gtt was started to control rate.
During this time, amiadarone infusion was started and rhythm control was adequately obtained.
He was transitioned to po amiadarone following placement of G tube.
Etiology was thought to be due to platelet clumping seen on smear, although CDiff infection and amiadarone therapy could not be ruled out.
# Cough, dry mouth, upper airway secretions: Various other complaints were addressed, including cepacol prn cough; mouth swabs for dry mouth (may consider artificial saliva); albuterol nebulizers for thick secretions from upper airway chronic disease.
IV vanc and zosyn restarted on [**2136-11-7**].
IV zosyn and bactrim discontinued on [**2136-11-15**] due to renal toxicity and worsening thrombocytopenia, levofloxacin started for pseudomonas/stenotrophomonas coverage.
# Dyspnea: A pigtail pleural drain was placed by IR on [**11-12**] for palliation of shortness of breath.
The tube was capped from [**11-14**] - 3 for hypotension.
# AF with RVR: rate was well controlled eventually on amiodarone 200mg daily.
However hypotension from [**11-7**] to [**11-15**] made diuresis impossible during these dates.
Pain control with intermittent IV morphine was continued.
# C diff: Mr. [**Known lastname 84573**] was maintained on PO vanc/IV flagyl with persistent diarrhea.
Likely [**2-15**] tumor invasion, but initially could not rule out HIT given heparin use.
Standing antiemetics were started and tube feeds were slowed.
Urology and wound consults were obtained.
[**Hospital1 **] wet-to-dry dressings were started.
Medications on Admission: -Metformin  1000 mg PO twice a day.
-Omeprazole  20 mg PO DAILY -Dilaudid  2-4 mg PO every four hours as needed for pain.
-Colace 100 mg PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
