Routine 24 hr and SPECT/CT images were not obtained secondary to patient clinical instability as above.
The NG tube tip is in the stomach.
In the setting of suboptimal image quality may not rule out a regional wall motion abnormality, particularly in the inferior and lateral regions as these segments are not consistently well visualized.
Small right pleural effusion and borderline cardiomegaly are unchanged.
ET tube is in standard position and a nasogastric tube ends in the lower stomach and out of view.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 yo M with AML s/p double cord transplant presenting with 3 days of watery diarrhea and abdominal pain.
He was given 2mg of morphine and 40mg of IV Lasix for concern of flash pulmonary edema and was transferred to the ICU satting 100% on a NRB.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient was in acute respiratory distress, agitated, anxious, tachycardic, and tachypneic.
He was asking for his oxygen to be turned up even further.
Respiratory distress thought to be in settting of parainfluenza type 3 PNA as he had been dyspneic and wheezing for days since diagnosis.
His antibiotics had already included vancomycin from a [**4-3**] blood culture of coag positive and negative staph, though per BMT recs these antibiotics were re-expanded to vancomycin and cefepime on [**4-27**] for fevers and hypotension.
Meropenem was substituted for cefepime on [**2102-4-28**], and PO vanco was added for empiric c dif coverage at that time as well.
Multiple serum assays including adenovirus, CMV, EBV, HSV, HHV6 were negative.
After failure to improve on vanco/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]/voriconazole/acyclovir, he was started on ambisome for enhanced fungal coverage on [**5-2**], and fungal isolator cultures were sent which were negative.
Voriconazole was stopped, and vancomycin was discontinued in favor of linezolid at that time for a blood culture growing VRE from [**2102-4-28**].
Concerned for a post-viral BOOP, pulse dose steroids were started on [**2102-5-3**] at Methylprednisolone 500 mg IV Q24H x 3d, though his respiratory mechanics actually worsened somewhat with decreasing compliance concerning for a post-ARDS fibrosis.
In light of a need for tracheostomy for continued support and failure to improve, a family meeting was thenheld on [**2102-5-8**] with the BMT and [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] teams regarding our inability to liberate him from the ventilator.
His wife expressed the patients wishes never to undergo prolonged supportive measures including tracheostomy, and elected to pursue terminal extubation with shift of care goals towards comfort measures.
Non-essential medications were discontinued, and he was continued on a fentanyl gtt.
He was treated medically with aspirin, plavix, lovenox, statin, beta blocker.
Renal team was consulted who recommended sodium bicarb infusions, also recommended renal ultrasound which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.
Of note, and extensive diarrhea work up was iniitiated, including stool elastase, chromogranin, 5-hiaa, yersina, ttg/iga, gastrin, seratonin, and vip.
His steroids were uptitrated and cyclosporine discontinued.
Steroids were tapered when his infectious picture worsened with parainfluenza, and were rapidly curtailed.
He later underwent steroid pulse towards the end of his hospital stay without much mprovement in his pulmonary status.
Line was removed and he was started on lovenox and later heparin gtt for one month, which was then discontinued.
It was likely secondary to GVHD, especially in the setting of his diarrhea and skin changes.
