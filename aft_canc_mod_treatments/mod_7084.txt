Admission Date:  [**2112-6-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-6-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2047-8-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Ceftriaxone / Ibuprofen  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8404**] Chief Complaint: asthma exacerbation/anaphylaxis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: epinephrine pen administration  History of Present Illness: 64M with history of CAD s/p CABG and severe asthma who presented from home with respiratory arrest.
He had a recent admission at an OSH two weeks ago where he underwent ASA desensitization therapy.
He developed wheezing at home today and took 30 prednisone but was then found lying in his back yard cyanotic.
He was given epinephrine and had rapid improvement in symptoms.
He was placed on continuous nebs, given mthylprednisolone 125 IV x1 and magnesium 2g IV.
He has had two attacks like this since his ASA densensitization but was able to take prednisone soon enough for the prior attack to self-resolve.
His asthma developed at age 20 and is associated with nasal polyposis and ASA sensitivity.
He failed and actually had a paradoxical reaction to inhaled steroids and has been prednisone dependent for 10 years.

# Asthma exacerbation/anaphylactic reaction: Per report, patient cyanotic at home, which improved with epi pen in field, nebs and prednisone.
Trigger felt likely to be aspirin, as asthma previously well controlled prior to starting ASA following recent ASA desensitization.
Therefore, aspirin was held.
Patient treated with NEBs q4hr + prn, started on outpatient Montelukast and Zyflo.
Per discussion with allergy and pulmonary, Zyflo was initiated due to the aspirin desensitization, and can be stopped, as he will not continue these desensitizations.
Patient started on 60 mg prednisone and then experienced increased SOB/decreased peak flow consequently started on Solmedrol 125mg q8hr.
He was then transitioned to prednisone 60mg PO daily and was stable on this regimen for the following 18 hours.
With regard to follow-up, patient and provider will be in close communication, but formal appointment is not required as there is no plan to continue aspirin desensitization.
With multidisciplinary discussion, patient will be discharged on prednisone 60 mg daily (with 2 week taper and to be managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9303**], discharged with epi pen for emergency use (patient educated how to use), and he was continued on outpatient montelukast.
Zyflo was discontinued as his aspirin desensitatization is discontinued.
He is not on inhaled corticosteroids due to paradoxical allergic reaction.
Patient instructed that as he missed dose is now re-sensitized to Aspirin and can not re-start taking without risk of worsening asthma/anaphylaxis.
We restarted albuterol and ipratropium INH PRN.
He will discuss with his pulmonologist re long acting inhaled steroid and long acting anticholinergic and will follow up with him soon.
He will continue to hold B-blocker until breathing/PEF at baseline.
# CAD s/p CABG: Held beta-blocker (bisoprolol) in setting of bronchospasm - patient to re-start once at baseline.
As aspirin stopped re-started plavix.

You improved with epinephrine, aggressive nebulizer therapy and prednisone.
The cause of your respiratory distress was likely secondary to your asthma and the trigger is unclear but may have been related to aspirin therapy.
YOUR ASPIRIN WAS DISCONTINUED.
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO NOT RESTART TAKING ASPIRIN ON YOUR OWN - BECAUSE YOU MISSED A DOSE YOU ARE NO LONGER DESENSITIZED AND RESTARTING PUTS YOU AT RISK FOR WORSENING ASTHMA/ANAPHYLAXIS.
HOLD: Bisoprolol (Zebeta) - you can re-start taking once your breathing is at your baseline and your peak flows are stable  CONTINUE Singulair: It is important to take Singulair as directed by your lung doctor  START Epinephrine as needed.
You have been given a script for Epinephrine shot and instructed how to use it if needed.
