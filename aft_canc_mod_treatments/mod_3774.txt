On [**2170-1-1**] she continued to have hypercapneic respiratory insufficiency and had to be intubated.A bronchoscopy followed demonstrating a mass above the carina,extending into the left mainstem bronchus.The right side was clear.Biopsies were taken from the area which showed non small cell lung cancer.On [**1-2**] she got a YAG laser resection of the endobronchial tumor with resultant opening of 40% of the L main stem bronchus.She also got an endoscopy which showed a benign appearing ulcer at the GE junction.No tumor was seen.A trial for extubation was made on [**1-7**] but she could not last too long of the breathing machine.
She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for stent placement of distal trachea and proximal mainstem bronchus.
Multiple trials with extubation were not successful, but the patient was eventually able to extubate, leave the ICU care setting, and transfer to the floor.
The surgical team was concerned about her nutritional status; as such a J tube was placed surgically with good success.
The patient was able to tolerate tube feeds at goal nutritional status (evaluated jointly between the primary team and [**Hospital1 18**] nutritionists) and manage the basic care of her J tube.
