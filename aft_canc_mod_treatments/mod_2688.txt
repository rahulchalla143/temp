Pt was tried on Passy-Muir valve on the 22nd, but was noted to have only weak voice with the valve.
Remaining antibiotics were discontinued on [**12-13**].
Open wound debridements began on [**12-21**], with resection of a small amount of necrotic tissue, and visualization of the fistula.
AS of [**12-28**], pt continued to have occasional runs of afib, and her metoprolol was increased in response to this.
