He was empirically treated w/ prednisone 60mg, albuterol/atrovent nebs, and levoflox 500mg PO.
After receiving ativan 2mg and dilaudid 1mg IV in prep for CTA, the pt became lethargic.
At that time, he was intubated for airway protection.
A dx of meningitis was considered, but LP was not performed due to INR 5.5; instead, he was empirically treated w/ levoflox 500mg, vancomycin 1gm, and meropenem 1gm IV.
In addition ,he completed a steroid taper, along with a course of azithromycin for his suspected reactive airways component.
All other antibiotics were discontinued.
He was continued on anti-coagulation with IV heparin, transitioned to coumadin with lovenox bridge prior to discharge.
His MM was felt to be stable and through communication with his oncologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**], it was determined that he would not need IVIG or other intervention for his stable low WBC.
HTN was also an issue at this hospitalization, and for this the pt was maintained on metoprolol and an acei with good bp control.
The pt was sent home with home oxygen, the last 3 days of a steroid taper, and inhalers with plans to f/u with his PCP for [**Name9 (PRE) **] and future PFT's, given the likelihood of COPD.
