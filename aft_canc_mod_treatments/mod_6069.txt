Of note, the patient had been discharged from [**Hospital3 **] approximately two weeks before after a hospitalization for pneumonia.
During that hospitalization the patient had remarked on hemoptysis and chest imaging revealed a right middle lobe lesion.
Upon the patient's second presentation on the 16th he was diagnosed again with pneumonia; started on vancomycin and levofloxacin.
He received bronchodilators for presumed COPD and was diuresed with furosemide 40 mg IV BID.
Unfortunately, despite these measures the patient's work of breathing remained high and he continued to tire so that he was intubated on [**9-23**].
His effusion has been somewhat controlled on furosemide [**Hospital1 **] and he has been satting reasonably well on [**1-11**] L of oxygen by nasal cannula.
Of note, vancomycin was discontinued once blood, urine, and sputum cultures returned without growth.
Past Medical History: -CAD s/p MI eight years ago, managed with PTCA -Hemorrhagic Stroke w/ craniotomy [**10/2162**] complicated by recurrent bleed and seizure approximately 6 mos later -HTN -COPD   Social History: He is retired from working on missile systems for [**Company 2676**].
Upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**], patient appearred to be overall improving following extubation, but still had significant work of breathing with accessory muscle use.
He was continued on levofloxacin.
He also developed pulseless electrical activity, requiring resuscitation with epi and atropine.
Discussions were held between the MICU team and the patient's wife and three children, when it was decided that the patient clearly did not want to remain on artificial life support for a prolonged period of time.
His goals of care were changed to focus on his comfort.
