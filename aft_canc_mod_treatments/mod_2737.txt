Admission Date:  [**2129-5-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-5-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-8-24**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: IV Dye, Iodine Containing Contrast Media / Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**] Chief Complaint: hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Chest tube Endotracheal intubation Central line CVVH, hemodialysis Laparoscopic Right Adrenelectomy, Urology   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 44 yo woman with h/o anxiety who presented to an OSH ED with abdominal pain.
She was also given Diltiazem 10 mg IV for tachycardia and received one dose of Lasix 60 mg IV.
EKG at the time demonstrated STE in V2 with ST depressions in V3-V6, so she was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for urgent cardiac catheterization.
She developed tachycardia to the 160s, for which she received Adenosine x3 and carotid massage, which did not improve the tachycardia.
In the CCU, the patient is intubated and sedated and cannot provide further history.
Mutation identification can be used to confirm a diagnosis, screen individuals at risk for familial disease, or distinguish familial from sporadic disease.

[**5-7**] post-line CXR:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of a left IJ catheter that extends to the mid portion of the SVC.
This suggests that it may be adnexal in origin and a differential possibility includes extra-adrenal paraganglioma, given the known right adrenal mass.
For further characterization of this lesion, MRI would be very helpful.
Empiric therapy was begun with doxazosin at 1 mg [**Hospital1 **] and labetalol at 200 mg [**Hospital1 **].
She was taken to the OR on [**2129-5-25**] where urology performed a laparoscopic right adrenalectomy.
Pt recovered from the procedure well though remained tachycardic to the 100s several days post-procedure and was started on metoprolol.
On exam patient with peripheral vasocontriction, ECHO demonstrating depressed EF 20-25% with apical sparing, PCWP of 25, CXR with pulmonary edema -> all suggestive of cardiogenic shock.
She was started on multiple pressors overnight - 12L of fluids were also administered.
The morning after admission, pressors were weaned after needle decompression of L pneumothorax and chest tube placement.
Of note, the patient was on 2 pressors prior to line placement and subsequent pneumothorax.
Her lactate, which had been elevated to 8 with her most profound hypotension, improved to 2 shortly after pressors were weaned.
She was started on doxazosin 1 mg [**Hospital1 **] and labetalol 200 mg [**Hospital1 **].
She was intermittently treated with IV labetalol and nitro gtt.
She was transitioned to doxazosin 1 mg po BID and labetalol 200 mg po BID with stability in her blood pressure.
ECHO showed depressed EF 20-25% with apical sparing, and troponin was elevated to 7.
Patient was intubated at OSH.
# Altered Mental Status: After intubation, the patient was initially sedated with midazolam and fentanyl drips.
Fent/midazolam drips were stopped 4-5 days into admission, but were thought to have accumulated in the setting of renal and liver failure.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Likely secondary to hypotension and consequent dense ATN, her creatinine continued to rise and she made <10cc/h of urine in the first few hours at [**Hospital1 18**].
Thus, L IJ hemodyalisis line was placed and CVVHD initiated.
Tunneled line was placed on [**5-17**].
# PHEUMOTHORAX:  After placement of hemodialysis line, patient was noted to become progressively more hypotensive and difficult to oxygenate the night of admission on [**2129-5-7**].
Needle decompression followed by chest tube placement were undertaken, and her hypotension and hypoxia improved considerably after this on [**2129-5-8**].
In the setting of concominant pressor-requiring hypotension, she was given bicarb gtt and  She later developed a concominant alkalosis (normal bicarb and anion gap 25) due to the CVVHD bath.
Transfused 1 unit of PrBC on [**5-21**] .
ACCESS: Initially, a swan ganz catheter was placed in the R femoral vein.
A left HD catheter was placed.
On [**5-17**] in IR, the HD catheter was tunneled and a PICC line was placed.

START taking ferrous sulfate (iron) to treat your anemia 3.
START taking Calcium acetate to lower your phosphorus level 6.
START taking Metoprolol to slow your heart rate.
You will have the dialysis catheter flushed and the the dressing changed twice weekly by VNA.
