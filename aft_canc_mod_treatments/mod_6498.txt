2+GRAM POSITIVE COCCI.IN CLUSTERS.
Interval decrease in size to organized peripancreatic and retroperitoneal collections extending into the anterior and posterior pararenal spaces with appropriate positioning to indwelling bilateral pigtail drainage catheters.
[**10-23**] CXR: ET tube is in standard placement, left internal jugular line ends in the left brachiocephalic vein.
Left PIC catheter tip still in the low SVC.
Nasogastric tube should be advanced 4 cm to move all the side ports into the stomach.
Interval decrease in size of the peripancreatic, retroperitoneal and intraperitoneal fluid collections.
Interval increase in the amount of peritoneal enhancement [**10-30**]: CXR- S/p L thoracentesis with pigtail catheter in L lung base, without evidence of ptx.
Post surgical changes of anterior abdomen redemonstrated [**10-31**]: CXR: Little change from prior [**11-1**]: CXR: retrocardiac opacity likely atelectasis improved.
Right PICC terminates at the cavoatrial junction.
NG tube probably does not extend below the GE junction, with side port in mid esophagus.
[**11-6**]: CXR:As compared to the previous radiograph, the position of the tracheostomy tube and the course of the nasogastric tube are unchanged.
Increased air within the surgically drained collection is of uncertain significance.
Hyperdense material within the gallbladder likely related to sludge as suggested on recent ultrasound.
