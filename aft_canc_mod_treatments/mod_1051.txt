2) Interval placement of right-sided chest tube with decreased right pleural fluid.
[**5-4**] pleural fluid, cell block:  adenocarcinoma   Brief Hospital Course: 1.  adenocarcinoma - Pt had recurrent right pleural effusion and a mass seen on CT scan; given his past history of smoking and asbestos exposure, concern was clearly for malignancy.
Pt underwent bronchoscopy with BAL.
Pt underwent talc pleurodesis; the first attempt was unsuccessful, so a second trial of talc pleurodesis was performed, and the chest tube had little output after [**2-1**] days and was successfully removed.
As pt had an acute infectious process, namely the pneumonia discussed below, chemotherapy was not an option while in the hospital.
However, with further analysis of the CT scan, it was felt that inflammation from the VATS procedure and inflammation from the pneumonia were the causes of obstruction, and XRT would not improve the situation, and may in fact be harmful.
2.  postobstructive pneumonia - Pt completed a 7 day course of levo/flagyl but continued to have increased O2 requirements (up to 10L NC, satting in the low 90s) and was febrile.
Pt was therefore placed on Zosyn/vanco, with a plan for a 2-week course total.
He was also treated with albuterol/atrovent nebs while in the hospital, and was discharged with MDIs.
He had a PICC placed for the rest of his course of Zosyn/vanco.
Metformin was held prior to CT scans.
He was discharged on oral hypoglycemics and instructed to check his fingersticks and call his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] >350.
CAD s/p CABG and stent - Pt was continued on atenolol, statin, and ACE I.  Pt will need to be restarted on aspirin as an outpatient.
