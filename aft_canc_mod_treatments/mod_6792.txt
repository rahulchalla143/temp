Patient s/p bronch APC for hemopytysis, XRT for R jaw met, Patient started XRT to lung and as resumed minimal hemoptysis.
Patient is a 69 year old male with metastatic poorly differentiated squamous lung ca with multiple mets and L main bronchus obliteration on carboplatin/taxol C1D1 [**4-25**],  who on night of most recent discharge after thoracentesis, had acute CP and was found to be in afib with RVR.
Anticoagulation was withheld given hemoptysis and potential for aggressive endobronchial lesion.
He was also seen by EP and given sotalol for rate/rhythm control .
Patient initially started on Lasix, which was discontinued upon discharge given mild hypotension and euvolemia.
Patient changed from atenolol with sotalol and was given statin and no further antiplatelet therapy given large risk for bleeding and hemoptysis.
