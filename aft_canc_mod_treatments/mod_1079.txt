The patient has also complained of increasing bilateral lower extremity edema over the last month and has been seen by his primary care physician in the past for intravenous fluid administration.
[**Last Name (STitle) 34867**] [**Name (STitle) 32412**], requesting intravenous fluid administration.
The patient was thought to be significantly dehydrated on examination and was therefore referred to the Emergency Department for evaluation.
In the Emergency Department the patient was noted to have a heart rate in the 140s with progressive hypoxia to as low as 77% on a nonrebreather.
Esophageal cancer treated with local radiation therapy, 5FU, Cisplatin diagnosed in [**2101-8-24**].
Status post Billroth 2 in the [**2060**] secondary to peptic ulcer disease.
ALLERGIES:  Penicillin causes a rash.
The patient was treated with intravenous Diltiazem push without change in his pulse, however, his systolic blood pressure did drop to the 70s.
Therefore an emergent cardiology consult was obtained and cardioversion was attempted with conscious sedation.
Further diuresis was put on hold pending potential cardioversion.
However, cardioversion was attempted with 200 jewels and then 300 and 360 jewels without success resulting in a rhythm of multifocal atrial tachycardia.
Cardiology consult subsequently recommended attempting rate control with an Esmolol drip, initiating gentle diuresis and obtaining a portable echocardiogram to assess function and valvular disease.
The patient was placed on an Esmolol and a neo-synephrine drip, which were titrated as needed to keep a mean blood pressure of greater then 60 and a rate less then 100.
The patient was treated with Lasix for gentle diuresis and cardiac enzymes were cycled to evaluate for the potential of myocardial ischemia as an initiating event.
A vegetation could not be definitively ruled out.
Given the acute onset of mitral regurgitation vasodilator therapy such as ace inhibitor and nitroglycerin were initiated as tolerated.
The possibility of surgical correction was discussed with the patient and his family who stated that they did not want surgery under any circumstances.
As the patient underwent gentle diuresis his oxygen saturations began to improve and his supplemental oxygen needs were slowly titrated down.
The patient's neo-synephrine drip was titrated off and the patient was started on Captopril [**Company 34868**].i.d.
The infectious disease consult recommended removing the patient's Port-A-Cath so that the infection would be easier to cure with antibiotics.
They felt the most likely bug responsive was staph aureus versus enterococcus versus strep viridans versus a coag negative staph and therefore requested treatment with Penicillin.
The patient's blood culture results demonstrated enterococcus, which was Ampicillin sensitive and therefore the patient was placed on Penicillin therapy intravenously with Gentamycin for synergy for two weeks after therapy.
Over the next few hospital days the patient's Captopril dose was titrated up as tolerated and his supplemental oxygen requirement was titrated down.
The patient had been off of pressor therapy for the last 48 hours and was tolerating low doses of ace inhibitor for afterload reduction.
The patient was subsequently given a normal saline bolus of 250 cc times three and then loaded on Digoxin therapy.
The patient appeared to respond well to the beta blocker with a decrease in his heart rate, however, additional fluid therapy did little to help the patient's blood pressure and resulting in a significantly worsened oxygen requirement.
Therefore the patient was treated once again with Lasix and over the next few hospital days a careful balance was maintained between controlling the patient's heart rate and not dropping his blood pressure too low.
The patient was therefore continued on standing doses of Captopril, Lopressor and Digoxin as well as prn Lasix doses, which were titrated up as tolerated over the next few hospital days.
The patient maintained a systolic blood pressure in the high 80s to low 90s, however, he tolerated this blood pressure well with adequate urine output and normal mentation.
A PICC line was placed for long term administration of antibiotic therapy.
Given the length (two weeks) of Gentamycin therapy for synergy against enterococcus the concern for ototoxicity was raised and an audiology consult was obtained.
Audiology recommended that the patient already had some hearing loss prior to admission for which he was seeking amplification therapies and recommended as little Gentamycin as possible with follow up audiology testing following release from the hospital.
The patient was currently on Digoxin and Lopressor for rate control and the patient's heart rate was maintained in the 90s to low 100s.
The possibility of cardioversion as a potential therapeutic option was discussed with cardiology who recommended that it was possible that his hemodynamics may improve with cardioversion to normal sinus rhythm.
In addition, cardiology recommended that consideration be given to starting the patient on Coumadin therapy and this was echoed by the patient's primary oncologist.
Therefore the patient was started on low dose Coumadin therapy with a goal INR of 2.0 to 2.5.
The results of the family meeting suggested that the family and the patient were hoping that the patient would improve enough to go to a rehab and they did want to complete antibiotic therapy for the current endocarditis.
At this point, however, the patient was treated with intravenous Lopressor 5 mg times two doses with a subsequent drop in his heart rate to the 100s and a bump in his systolic blood pressure to the 190s.
Therefore it was demonstrated that the patient did well when his Lopressor was administered despite low blood pressures, because his blood pressure acutely responsive to his heart rate.
Therefore his Captopril was increased to a dose of 50 mg t.i.d., his beta blocker was increased to a dose of 37.5 mg t.i.d.
and Digoxin was continued on a q.o.d.
In addition, the patient was started on a daily dose of Lasix at 20 mg po q day and was monitored for the appropriateness of that dose for continued effective gentle diuresis.
Over the next few hospital days the patient's medications were titrated as needed while the patient was screened for rehabilitation.
In addition, the patient was continued on Captopril 50 mg t.i.d., Digoxin every other day and Lasix 40 mg po b.i.d.
A therapeutic INR was obtained on Coumadin at 1 mg po q day.
Although the patient consistently demonstrated a blood pressure with a systolic in the low 80s, the patient maintained adequate urine output and excellent mentation.
The patient was transferred to rehabilitation on the 20th with thirty more days of antibiotic therapy remaining via his PICC line and a stable cardiac regimen obtained for management of his acute mitral regurgitation.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 62.5 mg po t.i.d.
