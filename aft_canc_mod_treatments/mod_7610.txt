He first noted symptoms in late [**2131-11-6**] including mid-epigastric pain, heartburn, dysphagia and weight loss.
He established care with a Gastroenterologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21448**] affiliated with [**Hospital6 3105**] (LGH) and was treated for H. pylori.
Due to severe pain and inability to tolerate PO, he presented to the ED at LGH and was admitted for dehydration and further work-up.
On [**1-18**], pt underwent posterior craniotomy for resection R cerebellar mass, as there was partial effacement of the 4th ventricle with mass effect.
Patient had his dexamethasone tapered down to 2mg [**Hospital1 **].
While on the floor he was on a clear liquid diet which was slowly advanced.
In addition to this, nutrition was consulted and patient was placed on 6 cans of isosource per day through his PEG tube.
Patient's biopsy results from mass at LGH was requested and sent here for further review to assist with onc treatment and planning.
#Brain Metastasis: S/p Cerebellar resection [**1-18**].
He was continued on decadron 2mg [**Hospital1 **].
#Leukocytosis: Patient with WBC in the 40's on presentation to OMED, trending upwards since admission.
While he is on steroids, he has been on a taper which is less likely causing this, patient could also have stress response to recent surgery but is still trending upwards.
CXR PA and lateral was obtained which did show concern for L lingula infiltrate, but as the patient clinically did not demonstrate signs of PNA we opted not to start a course of antibiotics.
Patient was given heparin subq starting [**1-11**], which was stopped prior to surgery on [**1-18**].
