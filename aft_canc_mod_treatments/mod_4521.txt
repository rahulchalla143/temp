He had multiple sites that could contribute to infection, including a mouth sore, a PICC line, and abdominal pain of unknown etiology.
As patient is neutropenic, vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl were started to treat the potential infecious sources.
The PICC line was removed and the tip cultured and had no growth.
Anti-fungal coverage was changed from fluconazole to micafungin to treat a possible fungal infection of the mouth and/or rectal area.
ID was consulted after blood cultures grew Strep viridans and E. coli, both of which were pan-sensitive.
We switched the patient off broad spectrum ABX to ceftriaxone based on ID recs.
Also, the patient was switched from micafungin back to his fluconazole prophylaxis.
He received a new PICC line on the day of discharge and was sent home on a 14 day course of ceftriaxone 2 g Q24hrs.
Flagyl was included in antibiotic coverage (as noted above) for possible biliary/abdominal process.
He required transfusions of both throughout his stay.
