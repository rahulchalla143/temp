Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Patient is a 27-year-old male with a history of CLL status post allogeneic transplant in early [**2111**] complicated by chronic extensive moderate graft-versus-host disease involving the GI tract and capillary leak syndrome, and recent PE who presents in septic shock.
He was initially covered broadly with linezolid, cefepime, cipro, and micafungin.
He was noted on admission to have numerous areas of skin breakdown with erythema on the left thigh concerning for infection.
He was given hydrocortisione 100mg IV q8 for adrenal insufficiency given his history of chronic prednisone use.
He was given IVF and pressors, and a left IJ line and an arterial line were placed.
As his infectious sources were controlled with antibiotics, he was weaned off of pressors by HD3.
On the floors, patient hemodynamically stable and weaned off hydrocortisone and restarted home dose prednisone 12.5mg daily  Hospital course was prolonged by repeated episodes of hypoxia requiring ICU transfers.
He was treated with linezolid, but due to extremely poor vascular access, HD and left PICC lines were not removed, but were treated with daptomycin locks.
He was deemed a poor surgical candidate for debridement or amputation due to extensive comorbidities and attempts to treat medically with ambisome were continued.
Following multiple discussions with health care proxy and extensive number of family members, all clearly indicated that patient would not want to be maintained on life support in the context of severe medical illness and continued decline in condition.
Following discontinuation of dialysis and vasopressor support, the patient peacefully expired in the presence of family members.
Hypoxemic respiratory failure:  The patient had large A-a gradient on presentation, and was therefore intubated and sedated with fentanyl and midazolam.
After being transferred to the floor, he remained on minimal O2 support.
He was placed on a NRB without significant improvement and was intubated for respiratory distress.
He remained on ventilatory support until HD 21 ([**9-6**]), at which time he was again extubated.
Within four days following extubation, he was able to maintain oxygenation and ventilation on room air.
He was transferred back to the ICU and was initally placed on 100% oxygen, and following cessation of hemoptysis was eventually weaned down to 3L oxygen via nasal cannula prior to transfer back to the floor.
He was again noted to have significant oropharyngeal bleeding, and due to repeated aspiration and hypoxia was intubated on [**10-19**].
CMV Viremia: Patient had a history of known CMV and while in the hospital he was continued on gancyclovir.
Two 4mm punch biopsies showed occlusive thrombotic vasculopathy, consistent with a scalded skin reaction, and his infection was initially treated with Vancomycin, but switched to daptomycin because of vamcomycin-associated [**Last Name (un) **].
His pain was managed with long and short acting opioid agents, as well as lidocaine gtt and PCA.
Following intubation on [**10-19**], patient remained on fentanyl gtt.
Patient was not a surgical candidate for debridement and hand became cyanotic and cool.
He was treated with ambisome and CT of sinus showed no evidence of maxillofacial disease, and BAL showed no sign of pulmonary disease.
He was already on empiric antibiotic coverage, so pneumonia was monitored on subsequent AM CXRs.
He was treated with linezolid and meropenem for presumed HCAP, later switched to vancomycin and meropenem as he became neutropenic.
He was intitially continued on heparin gtt due to his significant history of known DVT's.
HW, as his oropharyngeal bleeding continued to compromise his tenuous respiratory status, heparin gtt was discontinued on [**10-17**].
He received numerous platelet transfusions to maintain platelet count >30.
NG and OG tubes were not able to be placed, and patient was started on TPN sans lipids.
Albumin 50-100g/day was given per renal recommendations, without improvement in renal fucntion.
He was started on CRRT on HD15, which was used both to normalize his acid-base status and to reduce the significant anasarca developed secondary to his skin infection and fluid resuscitation for sepsis.
He was switched to HD with good results, moving to a 3x weekly schedule on [**9-11**].
He was treated with heparin gtt and lovenox.
Anticoagulation was discontinued on [**10-17**] due to signficant bleeding.
He is hypertensive at baseline, controlled with Lasix and metoprolol.
As an inpatient he was given metoprolol with occasional doses of hydralazine for SBP>170.
Portacath infection:  Port site swab grew MRSA on HD3, one possible source of infection.
Patient was already on vancomycin for left leg infection, which was continued for an 8 day course sufficient to cover this skin infection.
Tachycardia: Patient had sinus tach throughout ICU stay, thought to initially be secondary to sepsis and inflammatory response and later due to a component of pain from skin infection that the team was actively trying to control.
He was given fluid boluses as needed for fluid repletion and monitored on telemetry.
Blood pressures remained stable during these episodes, and were treated with IV nodal agents as needed.
Patient was hyperglycemic throughout admission, likely secondary to IV hydrocortisone and stress response of illness.
He was maintained on an ISS.
Patient was given stress dose steroids as above and was then tapered back down according to BMT recommendations.
CLL:  Patient appears to have been in remission since transplant, although his transplant course was complicated by capillary leak.
During his stay he was maintained on GVHD treatment with steroids, and was given antibiotic prophylaxis with valgancyclovir (CMV), micafungin (fungal), and atovaquone (PCP).
He was treated with Neupogen for neutropenia for a total 5 day course.
