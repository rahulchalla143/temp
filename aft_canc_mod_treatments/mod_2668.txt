His last palliative XRT session was three day ago and he received his last palliative chemotherapy dose four days ago.
His most recent notes three days ago during his XRT session indicate that the patient has been having issues with intermittent dizziness and was encouraged to increase his PO fluid intake at home.
He is also currently tapering dexamethasone that was initiated for his brain mets.
The patient also received 1 gram of vanco and 2 grams of cefepime for concern of infection in the setting of neutropenia with low grade temperature to 99.3 and initial tachycardia with hypotension.
Hydrocortisone 100mg was also admission given concern for adrenal insufficiency in the setting of his steroid taper.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: 1) NSCLC with mets to brain 2) intraductal pancreatic mucinous tumor s/p Whipple [**2144-10-7**] (Dr.  [**Doctor Last Name **]); pathology revealed 7.4 cm tumor at pancreatic head, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, limited to tumor.
Dexamethasone was started on [**2151-5-20**].
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 77 year old Portuguese speaking male with PMH of tobacco use, IPMN s/p Whipple procedure in [**10-10**], and recently diagnosed NSCLC in [**4-16**] after a biopsy of a RUL cavitary lesion currently receiving palliative XRT and palliative chemotherapy with Taxol/carboplatin also with known brain mets to the right temporal and left frontal lobe s/p Cyberknife with current dexamethasone taper presenting with weakness, poor PO intake, and dizziness most likely related to hypovolemia.
However, given neutropenia and low grade temperature, infection was possible and broad spectrum antibiotics were administered in the emergency room with vanc and cefepime.
He was transferred out of the ICU on HD#1 and to the floor where he continued to improve on IV fluids.
Pt was continued on home dexamethasone taper given low likelihood for adrenal insufficiency which he will continue as an outpatient.
Was neutropenic on admission but ANC on discharge was 3026 after receiving neupogen [**6-30**].
His urine lytes show elevated chloride and sodium which would point to SIADH, but this was also done after fluid resusictation so may not be accurate.
He had been receiving palliative XRT and chemotherapy with Taxol/carboplatin.
He is also s/p CyberKnife for his brain mets and currently on a dexamethasone taper.
He completed his radiation course in-house.
Troponin was negative.
