He missed doses of his anticonvulsants at [**Hospital **] Hospital, and received 1mg ativan before being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
He has had no nausea or vomiting recently; though he takes compazine as needed, his sister is not sure if he has required this medication in the past few days.
At baseline he is apparently conversant, has good sense of humor, is independent (makes his own lunch, goes to work, walks with a walker, meds provided for him by grp home), speech is slightly impaired and left hemiparesis from cerebral palsy.
The patient was seen in the ED initially and this hx/exam was obtained; trial of benadryl given for possibility that this was dystonic reaction to Compazine, with no effect; pt received 1 mg ativan for coverage, as he is missing his AEDs secondary to inability to swallow.
Past Medical History: - seizure d/o - both partial complex (staring spells with head going back, left arm raised) and secondarily generalized (GTC); history of status epilepticus including sz>20 min, and episode of "unresponsiveness" when at [**Hospital **] Hospital 2 yrs ago suspicious for prolonged seizure.
- baseline sz frequency is usually 2 grand mal sz per year with LOC and vomiting/fatigue postictally; 2-3x/wk "smaller" sz with head extension back, left arm elevation lasting seconds at a time - s/p vagus nerve stimulator - mental retardation - cerebral palsy - dandy walker syndrome - chronic right eye exotropia - s/p  ventriculoperitoneal shunt - s/p AVM removal [**2127**] - s/p R temporal lobectomy - left hemiparesis and hemihypoplasia -agenesis of left cerebellum - depression -Hx left knee and hip fractures with a rod in his leg -Hx (possible) GI bleed - also periodically has coffee-grounds emesis following grand-mal sz -HTN -Prostate cancer, undergoing daily XRT 5 days/week, started on [**2143-4-3**].
-slowed gastric emptying per GI evaluation during admission [**12-8**], psychotic from reglan trial -chronic hyponatremia, baseline 123-133   Social History: lives in a group home/independent housing, works in a shop (building, etc).

---- Please see OMR for remainder of studies  Brief Hospital Course: 48 year old man with hx Dandy-Walker malformation, hydrocephalus with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt apparently not working per last admission (though no intervention, per NS, as shunt apparently not needed), Areterio-Venous Malformation status post surgical resection, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, status post temporal lobe resection and vagus nerve stimulator placement for intractable epilepsy, and s/p recent admission to neurology service for increased seizure frequency, who presents after a "crushing" frontal headache followed by progressive dysarthria, numbness and sensation of stiffness of the limbs, followed by progressive rigidity of all four extremities and trunk.
Finally, he lost consciousness at with increased rigidity, less spontaneous movement, and suspected seizure, treated with ativan x 6 mg and dilantin load 1.5 g.  Several aspects of his history and exam were concerning, including his fever of 101, the dysarthria and the rigidity and immobility of his limbs.
He had no response in the ED to 1mg of ativan, nor response to benadryl given for the possibility of dystonic reaction.
He was intubated for airway protection and transferred to the ICU.
The possibility of an isolated posterior fossa elevated presure given his abnormal anatomy was raised, but unlikely.
He then had an EVD placed, but the ICP was not at all elevated.
The drain was left in for 2 days then removed as the pressure remained normal throughout.
This was the cause of his new symptoms and fit well with his presentation.
The dilantin was started in addition to all of his standing AEDs due to an episode that was either seizure or brief autonomic dysfunction.
Seizures:As above, he was continued on his home AEDs at home doses and dilantin was also added to the regimen.
He had no additional events here until the night of his death, when he had a seizure that was treated with ativan after he was extubated.
ID:He was started on CTX, vancomycin, and acyclovir on admission.
Overall:Pt remained stable on the ventilator and was easily maintained on CPAP throughout.
The main reason for continued intubation was airway protection.
He was seen by the stroke service who recommended aspirin and TTE, but also felt that his likelihood of recovery of function was very low, especially given his prior deficits involving the less affected left side of his body.
He was then put on morphine which greatly improved this situation, but did cause him to be asleep.
He required a large amount of morphine to achieve comfort and normalization of his breathing.
He was continued on dilantin and ativna for seizure prevention.
He was also continued on tylenol for his fever.
Tylenol did not seem to help bring down fever.
