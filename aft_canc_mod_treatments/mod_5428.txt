Pt was maintained on levaquin which he was already on for salmonella prophylaxis.
The patient maintained good oxygenation and ventilation on the ventilator.
He received 1 U PRBC and 2 U FFP for INR of 1.4. .
Patient was admitted on [**12-28**]   Past Medical History: 1) Hairy cell leukemia: 2) Prostate CA: treated with XRT in '[**12**].
3) non-small cell adenoCA of lung (RUL): Diagnosed after hemoptysis in [**9-13**] and subsequent biopsy by bronch; failed resection in '[**12**], now treated with XRT and chemo (taxol and carboplatin).
4) h/o salmonella sepsis: pt now on chronic levaquin.
5) HTN 6) GERD 7) Pneumothorax: in '[**11**] 8) + PPD: neg AFB smear and culture, on INH.
OP with ETT and OGT--no obvious lesions Neck: no JVD Lungs: decreased BS on right CV: RRR, nml S1S2, no mrg Abd: soft, mildly distended, NT, naBS Ext: chronic venous stasis hyperpig of b/l LE without edema, cords.
He was admitted to OSH on [**12-28**] with fever and borderline neutropenia; he was started on levofloxacin for ?
Pt was maintained on levaquin which he was already on for salmonella prophylaxis.
The patient maintained good oxygenation and ventilation on the ventilator.
He received 1 U PRBC and 2 U FFP for INR of 1.4. .
Has also been receiving radiation treatment with last treatment [**2113-12-28**].
Has received about 24 treatments (5 treatments/wk x 5 weeks).
Has been taking Procrit for chronic anemia, and received 1U PRBC on [**2113-12-22**].
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for the specific interventional radiology and pulmonology procedures unique to the institution.
The patient, who had been intubated for airway protection, was extubated without incident and suffered no respiratory failure.
He had arrived with fever and neutropenia from the OSH, and vanco/caspo/cefepime broad coverage was initiated.
Multiple cultures were drawn given the persistent fever, and all were negative in the final read.
Although the patient was stabilized via multiple bronchoscopies and interventional radiologic procedures, rebleeding remains a significant risk, and little could be done if another catastrophic bleed were to develop.
His persisent neutropenia was unexpected so far out from his last dose of chemotherapy.
He was continued on vanc/cefepime/caspo until ANC > 1000, then all were discontinued since the patient had remained afebrile for > 48 hours and had persistently negative culture data.
CT surgery has evaluated patient and would only take back to the OR if massive bleeding recurs.
Patient will likely suffer recurrent bleeding and hemoptysis despite our best efforts.
-- End of life issues currently being addressed with family, SW involved, palliative care involved.
Filgrastim being held now for lack of response.
Completed 24 doses of XRT prior to admission.
-- Follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] after discharge -- No filgrastim for now as above -- Morphine PRN for pain .
Been on therapy since [**Month (only) 462**] or [**2113-9-9**], started after low grade fevers and cough with positive PPD.
History of salmonella sepsis: Patient on chronic levaquin as outpatient for this.
-- Continue levaquin prophylaxis.
No intervention would be warranted at this time as pressures appear normal and no evidence of shunting with saline contrast.
-- R popliteal DVT seen on [**1-16**], very distal with no proximal extension -- *** This should be followed up in 1 week to assess for proximal extension *** -- Patient would be an extremely poor candidate for anticoagulation .
Will continue RISS for now, as tight glycemic control is likely to be beneficial from an ID standpoint.
Hypertension: Transitioned from labetolol to metoprolol.
-- Follow BP and titrate metoprolol as needed, good control recently.
Pain control medications likely not helping this.
Prostate CA: History of prostate CA s/p radiation treatment in [**2112**].
-- Patient unable to void yesterday, straight cath'ed with 600cc drainage and patient relief.
-- Should have voiding trial with d/c foley after transfer to rehab.
Have d/c'd foley and checked UA, cx.
Have sent for c. diff, would be at risk for this given recent ICU stay and broad spectrum antibiotics.
FEN: General diet, soft with thin liquids per S&S.
PPX: No heparin [**1-11**] bleeding risk.
