He was continued on antibiotics (see below).
He was continued on low dose dexamethasone 1mg qday while in house.
Patient was evaluated for nonconvulsive seizure disorder by EEG, with prior study [**2145-12-28**] showing subcortical dysfunction but not clear evid of sz activity, first study on this admission [**2146-1-19**] showing cortical and subcortical dysfunction, no clear evid of sz.
The patient was started on Dilantin and Keppra at this time.
2) Aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis: the patient had at least two likely aspiration events, one prior to his admission to [**Hospital1 2025**] when he was found at [**Hospital1 **] with tube feeds all over his clothing, and a second witnessed event during bronchoscopy at [**Hospital1 2025**].
Pt had completed 28d course of clinda/primaquine and PCP smear was negative at [**Hospital1 2025**].
After admission, he was continued on Cefipime (started at [**Hospital1 2025**]) and Flagyl was added given witnessed aspiration at [**Hospital1 2025**], to cover asp flora.
Vancomycin was started to cover MRSA from sputum.
Patient's antibiotics were changed multiple times during his admission.
On transfer from [**Hospital1 2025**], the patient was on Cefepime and Levaquin.
Immediately, the Levaquin was d/c'd and Flagyl was added.

Patient was off all antibiotics for three days, then noted to have LLL asp pna vs. pneumonitis on [**2146-2-7**] and so Levaquin and Flagyl were started again on [**2146-2-8**].
3) DVT- neg CTA and LENI's here during previous admission; Fragmin started at [**Hospital1 2025**] was dc'd on admission and pt maintained on prophylactic dose heparin.
Patient was started on heparin gtt anticoagulation.
As patient was a poor candidate for anticoagulation, IR placed an IVC filter.
Patient's astrocytoma was not felt to have changed on this admission, and as a result his symptoms were not felt to be directly related to this lesion.
It was felt that his tumor may have lowered his threshold for becoming confused, somnolent, but that either infection or seizures were the cause of his altered mental status.
Patient was continued on low dose dexamethasone, as well as dilantin and keppra.
5) GI bleed: The patient had a PEG placed on [**1-20**] in the setting of anticoagulation.
He then began to have melena, external bleeding from his PEG/J site and received transfusions of 5 U PRBC without adequate HCT increase.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for intubation for the purposes of preforming an EGD.
The PEG/J tube was removed by IR over a wire and a PEG tube was placed.
Following the procedure, the patient had an IVC filter placed as he has had a DVT and given his bleeding, anticoagulation was not an option.
He continued to have a dropping HCT after the procedure and was transfused several more units of PRBCs over the remainder of his admission.
Supported with transfusions as necessary.
Patient required a total of 4 units before EGD, 6 units while in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for EGD, then 2 units after back on the floor for a slow hct drop with guaiac positivity.
