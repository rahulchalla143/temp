HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 27830**] is an unfortunate 84 year old female with a history diabetes mellitus, polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], prior transient ischemic attacks, bilateral carotid artery stenosis measured at 40 and 60% by ultrasound and carotid Duplex studies; history of hypertension, history of deep venous thrombosis, recurrent pulmonary embolism, and renal insufficiency, who was admitted to the Vascular Service after complaining of a several months history, approximately four to five months, of claudication and rest pain.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ultimately, after being evaluated by Cardiology and being cleared and being followed by the Diabetes Service of [**Last Name (un) **], the patient did go to the Operating Room by [**2130-7-13**], where she underwent a right common femoral artery to above the knee popliteal graft using PTFE and composite to the AT with non-reversed saphenous vein graft done with angioscopy and valve lysis.
She got transfused a unit of packed cells interoperatively and received 3500 cc of Crystalloid, and underwent ............ and ................ with a PTFE, composite graft.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**] did suggest to check troponin I for a question of a cardiac event, as covered in the perioperative period to precipitate this, to check for a fractional excretion of urea to see if this was consistent with a prerenal state, continue the diuretics, maintain blood pressure greater than 120 for renal perfusion, and to start optimizing her nutrition.
At that time, Neurology's impression was that this was just an 84 year old woman with a prior polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], prior transient ischemic attacks, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, who was noted to have difficulty speaking after right femoral to AT bypass graft using composite PTFV and non-reversed saphenous vein.
Consider to stop her subcutaneously heparin since her INR was therapeutic.
Recheck urinalysis since the leukocyte esterase was also positive and to continue support as needed.
GI:  She was tolerating tube feeds to goal.
She was being diuresed with Lasix and Zaroxolyn.
A PA catheter was thereafter changed to a CVL.
Continued on LR at 15 hour tube feeds at goal, Unasyn and Vancomycin, and ceftriaxone, and a bowel regimen with medications.
