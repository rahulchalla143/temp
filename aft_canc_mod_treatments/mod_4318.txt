Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a normal systemic arterial blood pressure with a central aortic pressure of 125/52 mmHg.
Due to co-existing aortic regurgitation, the pressure half-time estimate of mitral valve area may be an OVERestimation of true mitral valve area.
POST-BYPASS The patient is receiving epinephrine, norepinephrine, and milrinone by infusion.
He received medical management over the next several days and clearance from oncology/hematology for his prostate cancer and nephrology for dialysis.
On [**11-20**] he was brought to the Operating Room where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft x 5 and mitral valve repair.
He weaned off Levophed, Milrinone and Epinephrine on POD 1 and remained hemodynamically stable with an adequate cardiac output.
His permanent pacemaker was interrogated on POD 1 and found to be functioning normally.
His temporary pacing wires were then removed.
He remained on Vasopressin for hypotension for several days post op and was eventually weaned off completely on POD 6.
He had poor oral intake and supplements were started as well as calorie counts.low dose beta blocker was subsequently added.
