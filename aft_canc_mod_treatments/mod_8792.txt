# Sepsis and pneumonia: Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 104577**] presented with fever, altered mental status, cough, tachycardia, hypotension, leukopenia,  She was found to have right lower lobe pneumonia on chest x-ray at presentation.
She remained hypotensive despite 6L of IVF and initially required pressors in the emergency room, she was subsequently admitted to the ICU.
Pressors were weaned off overnight on first night of admission.
In the ICU, she  was started on vancomycin, zosyn, and levofloxacin to cover for HCAP given that she was recently admitted in [**1-/2120**] and received a 5 day course of levofloxacin at that time.
Antibiotics were changed to vancomycin, cefepime and levofloxacin upon transfer to the floor.
She received 5 days of levofloxacin during her admission.
A PICC line was placed and she will complete an 8 day course of vancomycin/cefepime as an outpatient.
She was started on PO vancomycin which she will continue for a total of 2 weeks after her 8 day course of HCAP antibiotics is completed.
Patient requires coverage for HCAP given recent admission.
There was evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR after aggressive volume resuscitation in the ED, however her hypoxia resolved after the first day of admission.
# Neutropenic fever: ANC was 286 at admission to [**Hospital1 18**], she was placed on neutropenic precautions.
She was febrile at admission and was covered broadly as described above, she received vanc/Zosyn/levofloxacin in the MICU and vanc/cefepime/levofloc upon transfer to the floor.
She was continued on her home dose of gabapentin 600 mg Q8H.
She was continued on a lower dose of oxycontin given her initial altered mental status.
#Extensive stage metastatic SCLC: She had been receiving palliative chemotherapy and radiation at the time of presentation.
As described above, her respiratory status was stable after her pneumonia was treated and she was breathing comfortably on room air with no wheezing on exam at discharge.
# GERD: Continued on home omeprazole.
