She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED and evaluated by the Neurosurgery consult team, and underwent CTA of the head and neck that raised concern for PRES.
She was admitted to the Neuro ICU as she was intubated, sedated, and on a nicardipine gtt for BP control.
Since admission, Brain MRI done [**8-3**] was also suggestive of PRES but could not optimally assess for brain mets as this was done without contrast given the pt's acute renal failure.
EEG also showed no seizure activity, and she is being maintained on Keppra currently.
Her sedation has been weaned and she is on Ativan PRN for sedation.
She continues on the nicardipine gtt to achieve goal SBP <140, with hydralazine standing + PRN and labetalol PRN as well to titrate this off.

However, subtle vasogenic edema related to small metastases is difficult to exclude in the absence of intravenous contrast.
Previously identified subarachnoid blood in the ambient cistern is no longer seen, compatible with expected evolution of blood products.
Her FeNa was 0.7% on [**8-4**], suggesting a pre-renal etiology, so she has received significant IV fluids.
Her known malignancy, recent therapies with Avastin and Gemcitabine, and malignant hypertension, all could cause micro-angiopathic processes to account for these, as opposed to TTP.
Finally, she developed a ventilator-associated pneumonia, with CXR showing a right hilar infiltrate and possible left lower lobe consolidation, and BAL sample showing GPRs, so she has been covered broadly with Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Ciprofloxacin.
Speech and swallow was consulted and recommended a thin liquid, soft food diet.
# Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient underwent an eight-day course of antibiotics.
Considered adding Ativan 0.5 mg as recommended if [**Known lastname 6686**] response to increased dose of Seroquel, but proved unnecessary.
A brain MR has been ordered to help determine etiology of patient's hallucinations and delusions and  demonstrated no acute changes and no evidence of intracranial metastases.
Followed renal function, since patient had acute renal failure with anasarca in ICU.
Lasix has been discontinued.
# Malignant HTN To anticipate eventual discharge home, anti-hypertensive regimen was simplified to Labetalol 300 mg TID, which controlled patient's blood pressure well.
CT scan given following quick-onset headache.
Cardiology thought bradycardia might be nuerally meduated but also suggested Cardio a reduction in labetalol dose to 300 mg.
Kept on labetolol 300 mg TID, which controlled blood pressure.
Haptoglobin was < 5, but ADAMTS13 levels regular, no heparin antibody, PT, PTT, INR all within normal range, as was fibrinogen.
Continued folic acid and B12.
