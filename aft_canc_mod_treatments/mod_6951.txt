On [**2159-10-22**], patient presented s/p fall and was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation in the setting of acute stress induced cardiomyopathy with an EF of 25-30% and bilateral pleural effusions.
Patient underwent pericardiocentesis with drainage of 700 cc of straw colored fluid.
Patient was diuresed and underwent bilateral thoracentesis (700cc and 1500cc).
Hospital course complicated by strep pneumo septicemia and patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics.
Since her discharge, patient has been doing fairly well, and denies any signficant chest pain, dyspnea, fevers, chills, palpitations, PND, or orthopnea.
She has been fatigued since her prior hospitalization and can only travel around the house without developing significant dyspnea.
Patient was started on gleevec 6 days prior, and was evaluated by her cardiologist on [**2158-12-19**] as an outpatient follow up visit and surveillance TTE demonstrated a moderate pericardial effusion with early signs of tamponade physiology.
Today, patient was taken to the cath lab and underwent ballon pericardiotomy with removal of 450 cc of serosanguinous fluid.
Of note, patient is also s/p bilateral thoracentesis during her prior hospitalization.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Drain located over the left chest, draining serosanguinous fluid.
Groin: Right sided cath acccess site c/d/i with no bruits, hematomas.
Drain over left chest has been removed.
Pericardial Fluid Analysis ([**2159-10-22**]) WBC 311 hct 8.5 polys51 bands2 lymphs43 monos3 eos1 total protein4.1 glu92 LDH305 amylase29 albumin2.9 .
The effusion is circumferential, with predominance of fluid posterior to the heart.
Pericardiocentesis and balloon pericardiotomy was performed under local anesthesia and moderate sedation via sub-xiphoid approach.
Right femoral artery and vein were also accessed with placement of a 4 Fr and a 5 Fr sheath respectively.
Using an alligator clip connected to the pericardial needle, as well as a pressure tube to directly transmit pressure from the needle tip, thus providing multiple layers of safety for the procedure, the needle was advanced to the pericardial sac, and a guidewire was placed.
A dilator was advanced over the wire and a .038 J-wire was then placed in the pericardial sac.
A drainage catheter was then advanced posteriorly in the area of loculation and about 450 ml serosanguinous fluid was drained and sent to lab for analysis.
Then an 8 Fr [**Last Name (un) **] tip sheath was advanced to the sac over an Amplatz superstiff wire for optimum support.
The balloon was then withdrawn and a pericardial drainage catheter was placed posteriorly in the pericardial sac and sutured to skin.
The entire procedure was performed under repeated echo guidance, position of catheters in the pericardial sac being verified by agitated saline injection through the catheters.
Patient had a brief vasovagal episode during the procedure that was treated with atropine and IV fluids.
The arterial and venous sheaths from the right groin were removed in the cath lab and manual pressure held for hemostasis.
Patient tolerated the procedure well and left the cath lab in a stable condition without any complaints.
Pericardial effusion successfully treated with pericardiocentesis and balloon pericardiotomy 3.
Pericardial drain to be removed when drainage/24 hours <75 ml.
Pericardial drain is in place.
Followup of the patient after antibiotic treatment is highly recommended.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 year old female with a PMH notable for CML in remission for 15 years on hydroxyurea with recent relapse, s/p recent admission from [**Date range (1) 105483**]/11 with complicated medical course necessitating ICU care following fall, pericardial effusion, acute stress induced cardiomyopathy and volume overload, who underwent pericardiocentesis with drainage of 700 cc straw colored effusion on [**2159-10-22**] and represented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2159-12-20**] with recurrent pericardial effusion.
Now s/p pericardiotomy and hemodynamically stable.
# Pericardial Effusion: Differential for pericardial effusion is broad and includes idiopathic (most commonly), iatrogenic, trauma, malignancy, post MI, uremia, thyroid disease, viral, medication related or collagen vascular disease.
More recently, patient was started on gleevec, which has been associated with pericardial effusion, ascites, pleural effusion, CHF, LV dysfunction.
Pt underwent cardiac cath with balloon pericardiotomy [**2159-12-21**].
Gram stain of pericardial fluid was unrevealing and cultures showed no growth.
S/P pericardiotomy pt remained hemodynamically stable without elevated pulsus.
Drain was pulled on [**2159-12-22**] without issues after repeat TTE showed no further reaccumulation of pericardial fluid.
Localized pain at drain site significantly improved.
hematocrit and CBC stable.
She did not seek therapy or medical attention for those at that time.
pt was being treated with Gleevac at the time of admission, which was held as it was felt to be a likely etiology for pericardial effusion re-accumulation.
#pain - from pericardial drain site - managed with tylenol/oxycodone prn.
Pt found to have evidence of right upper and right lower lobe consolidation, given 5d course of levofloxacin for CAP.

You underwent a procedure called ballon pericardiotomy - fluid was removed from around the heart and a small window was created in the casing around the heart so that fluid would not accumulate in that space again.
You improved after the procedure and we felt comfortable sending you home.
