Intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation and some gallbladder wall sludge.
Based on this patient's clinical symptoms consistent with cholangitis and prior history of cholelithiasis, [**Year/Month/Day **] would be most beneficial for further evaluation.
Removal of the double pigtail biliary stent and a calculus      from the common bile duct.
Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of mid SVC.
Biliary stent is projecting over the right upper abdomen.
Examination is severely limited and had to be terminated due to combination of factors including multiple artifacts noted in the upper abdomen related to prior surgery and metallic hardware in the lower abdomen,  inability of patient to breath-hold and lack of peripheral IV line.
A pigtail stent is noted in the distal common bile duct with marked decompression compared to prior CT. Sludge and gallstones are noted dependently within the gallbladder without evidence for acute cholecystitis.

Pt was found to have fever, RUQ pain, transaminitis and bile duct obstruction.
She was started on cipro and flagyl upon admission as well as IV vanco given her recent instrumentation/[**Year (2 digits) **] at OSH 1 month ago with stent pull.
A plastic stent was placed.
Pt will need a repeat [**Month/Day (4) **] in 1 month at [**Hospital6 1597**] for stent extraction.
In the ICU, pt received continued aggressive IVFs.
The final ID recommendation was to place pt on IV daptomycin during admission and switch to [**Hospital6 11958**] to complete a 2 week total course for bacteremia (600mg [**Hospital6 11958**] [**Hospital1 **]), 11 more days after discharge.
However, only 1 blood culture from the line was positive with subsequent cultures negative and prior cx's negative.
Pt will be treated with cipro/flagyl for 10 days for cholangitis.
-would recommend weekly cbc, lfts, chem 7 while on [**Hospital1 11958**] and given recent cholangits.
The team will likely be performing a CCY in the outpatient setting after treatment for cholangitis/bacteremia.
Pt will need a repeat [**MD Number(4) **] in 1 month's time for stent extraction at [**Hospital6 2561**].
