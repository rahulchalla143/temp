2 JP drains near stapled area, one drain has no fluid, the other has about 100cc of serosanguinous drng and have emptied approx 400 cc in last 24 hours.
The patient was originally treated with a low-dose beta blocker.
Given the possibility of coronary vasospasm, however, the patient was switched to verapamil therapy.
The patient was also started on low-dose ACE inhibitor therapy (lisinopril 5 mg PO daily), given her ejection fraction.
Because of presence of some coronary disease, the patient was started on aspirin (81mg PO daily).
Started on verapamil, lisinopril, ASA therapies.
The patient was provided nebulizer treatments with ipratropium and albuterol.
The patient was encouraged to follow up with PCP outpatient regarding daily inhaler treatment, as she was thought to have poorly controlled COPD that would benefit from therapy.
# ABDOMINAL WOUND CARE:  s/p colectomy, cholecystectomy, lysis adhesion, hernia repair.
Surgery was consulted--they think the patient can have her staples removed 7-10 days after her operation (Day 10=[**2196-11-13**]).
We are trying to get patient an appointment with Surgery as outpatient to have staples removed and also to examine JP drains for removal.
The patient's right JP drain still produced more than 30 mL per day on discharge; the left JP drain did not.
