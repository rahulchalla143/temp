History of Present Illness: 78 F with hx AF, recently stopped coumadin 7 days ago for a R-mastectomy and was supposed to re-start it tomorrow, hx prior stroke in mid-90's (daugher unclear how it manifested, possibly as R-weakness, but remembers that it was mild and resolved completely), HTN, and COPD, was last seen normal at 9 pm last night, and was found by family members this morning slumped to the right and unable to produce speech.
She was taken to [**Hospital3 4298**] Hosp where NIHSS was rated as 16, and she received a NCHCT c/w a L-MCA infarct.
She was intubated electively for airway protection and subsequently sedated.
Past Medical History: HTN COPD AF prior stroke R-mastectomy   Social History: Smokes [**12-17**] ppd, (+) EtOH use, amt unknown, no drugs   Family History: NC  Physical Exam: T- 97.5F BP- 130/82 HR- 86 RR- 12 O2Sat 100% intubated Gen: Lying in bed, NAD HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa Neck: in C-collar, no carotid or vertebral bruit CV: irreg irreg, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: mild wheezes bilaterally Abd: +BS, soft, nontender Ext: No c/c/e  Neurologic examination: Mental status: intubated, not on continuous sedation, but has gotten 100 mcg fentanyl and unknown amt of versed.
MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates lack of flow in the distal petrous, proximal cavernous, supraclinoid ICA, left MCA and left proximal ACA likely on a thromboembolic basis.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal anterior wall, mid to distal anterior wall and anterior septum.
Sub-optimal image quality due to tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and poor echo windows.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 78 F with  hx AF, recently stopped coumadin 7 days ago for a R-mastectomy and was supposed to re-start it tomorrow, hx prior stroke in mid-90's (daugher unclear how it manifested, possibly as R-weakness, but remembers that it was mild and resolved completely), HTN, and COPD, was found this morning slumped to R and unable to produce speech with NCHCT c/w a possible L-MCA infarct.
Patient was intubated while at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital before her transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
She was admitted to the ICU and MRI/A showed a large L MCA distribution stroke and given large infarct, she was not bridged with heparin drip for risk of hemorrhagic transformation.
She was restarted on her home Coumadin dose and ASA for bridging until therapeutic.
She was extubated on HD#2 but within several hours, developed increased sputum with respiratory distress hence re-intubated and sputum culture initially grew 3+ GNR and 1+ GPCs plus leukocytosis with WBC up to 16K hence broad antibiotics of Vancomycin and Zosyn were started which was switched to ampicillin-sulbactam once H.influenzae was isolated on [**3-15**].
Patient was successfully extubated on [**3-15**] afternoon but patient required frequent suctioning for poor handling of secretions.
Also, on HD #3, patient was found to have tachycardia hence EKG was obtained which showed no acute change but cardiac enzymes were elevated hence most consistent with NSTEMI.
Cardiology was consulted who recommended medical management including rate control with metoprolol and adding digoxin.
Her Coumadin was stopped and she was started on Lovenox 50mg [**Hospital1 **] instead also in anticipation for possible PEG placement during this admission.
There were no signs of DIC and hematology felt that it was most likely combination of poor nutrition, antibiotics (she was on Unasyn for H.flu pneumonia) and vitamin K deficiency.
Her INR improved drastically with 5mg of Vitamin K and she successfully underwent [**3-23**] but she self-DC'd the PEG on the night of placement despite restraining of her strong/non-paretic hand.
Prior to the PEG placement, she pulled out several NG tubes as well.
Patient had rectal tube placed and received multiple enemas for decompression of cecal distention.
Family including HCP, [**Name (NI) 16883**] reports that the patient always was clear about not wanting heroic measures hence given poor prognosis and her previous stated wishes, plan of care was changed to maximize comfort on [**3-26**].
She was made comfort measures only.
