<br>   Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:  <br>MRSA septicemia: The most likely source of infection was thought to be the dialysis catheter placed [**2133-7-2**].
The dialysis catheter was removed and the patient was started on IV vancomycin and gentamycin.
A new R IJ catheter was placed for temporary use during HD with the plan to place a tunnelled line when the patient was no longer septic.
Gentamycin was D/Ced on [**7-20**] as vancomycin was thought to be adequate (no other organisms besides MRSA identified).
Vancomycin was continued with plans for a total of 14 day course; it was administered after HD and troughs were monitored the morning after HD and titrated accordingly per renal's recommendations.
These were monitored with plans to tap if he worsened clinically, but as his status improved with antibiotics and HD the effusions were not tapped.
This was supplemented with mitodrine to keep BP at a goal of SBP in the high 80s and MAP > 55.
Midodrine was continued at 10 mg TID.
He had HD on [**7-19**] with removal of 2.8 L. UF [**7-20**] removed 3.5L.
Because his tunnelled HD catheter was thought to be the source of his infection, this was removed at presentation and replaced with a right IJ compatible with HD for use over the short term.
IR and renal were agreeable with placement of this line and it was placed on [**7-24**] when patient's family agreed to the procedure.
The catheter was accessed for HD on [**7-27**].
He was started on flagyl on [**7-19**] and this was continued until [**7-21**].
On the PM of [**7-20**] he was noted to have a rash over his abdomen and as this coincided with the start of flagyl ~1.5 days prior, and flagyl was D/Ced.
He was put on PO vancomycin for the C.diff instead with plan to switch to IV daptomycin if the patient were to have diarrhea or other signs of C.diff active infection.
This was thought to be most likely a drug rash; the patient had been on vancomycin (for MRSA sepsis) since [**7-16**] and flagyl (for C. diff positive stool) since [**7-19**].
Flagyl was D/Ced and the patient was put on PO vancomycin instead.
The rash was monitored with the plan that if it did not improve off flagyl (thus possibly a drug rash secondary to vancomycin) that both IV and PO vancomycin would be discontinued and he would instead be put on IV dapsone.
As he was already put on vancomycin for MRSA sepsis, no further antibiotics were added at admission.
The leg was carefully monitored with dressing removals and daily checks, and resolved with the vancomycin.
Famotadine was D/C for possible H2 blocker toxicity.
[**7-20**] platelets 91; [**7-21**] platelets 75.
