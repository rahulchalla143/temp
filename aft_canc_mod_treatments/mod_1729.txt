The patient is post CABG with median sternotomy wires and clips seen in the mediastinum.

Brief Hospital Course: 89 year-old male with MMP including CAD, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, and recent admission to OSH with enterococcus fecalis UTI and bacteremia, complicated by presumed enteroccus endocarditis (negative TEE but recurrent positive blood cultures and ongoing fever), treated with Ampicillin IV (1 gm IV q 6 hours) and Gentamicin IV (started on [**2113-1-5**]), now admitted with fever, hypotension and respiratory symptoms.
Given concern over potential line infection, PICC line was D/C'd on admission.
The antibiotic regimen was changed to Vancomycin IV and Gentamycin IV for Rx of enterococcus +/ line infection.
The patient was quickly weaned off Dopamine in the ICU, and was transferred to the floor on [**2113-1-15**].
However, Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to spike fever up to 102.3 on Vancomycin and Gentamicin.
Given his respiratory symptoms, Levofloxacin 500 mg PO QD was added to cover for pulmonary organisms.
A nasal wash was also sent to rule out Influenza, which came back positive for Influenza A.
He was kept on droplet precautions in hospital (D/C'd on [**2113-1-24**]).
Levofloxacin D/C'd on [**2113-1-20**].
Intermittent wheezing in hospital, kept on Albuterol and Ipratropium nebs prn.
Of note, sensitivities were repeated on the OSH isolate and Ampicillin sensitivity was confirmed, MIC <=2.
Antibiotics were changed back to Ampicillin 1 gm IV q 6 hours, and Gentamicin 80 mg IV q 48 hours (dose adjusted according to levels and creatinine) on [**2113-1-20**].
Ampicillin increased to 2 gm IV q 8 hours on [**2113-1-23**] after discussion with ID team.
Plan is to complete 6 weeks of therapy with Ampicillin and Gentamicin (last doses on [**2113-2-16**]).
PICC line in place.
Hold Gentamicin if creatinine >2.5.
2) CHF: Lasix and spironolactone were held on admission given hypotension, restarted on [**2113-1-15**].
CXRs in hospital revealed progressive fluid overload, and Lasix dose was titrated up to maintain negative fluid balance.
Per patient's wife, out-patient Lasix dose is 160 mg PO QAM and 120 mg PO QPM.
On Lasix 80 mg PO BID at discharge, with goal to titrate to even to negative fluid balance as an out-patient.
Low threshold to increase Lasix if increasing edema on exam, or >=3lbs weight gain as creatinine tolerates.
3) CAD: Troponin 0.09 (peak) on admission, felt likely troponin leak in the setting of infection and renal failure.
In hospital, he was continued on Metoprolol and ASA.
Also continued on Zetia for hyperlipidemia.
4) Atrial fibrillation: Metoprolol initially held in the setting of hypotension, restarted as BP tolerated.
Coumadin dose decreased to 1 mg PO QHS given elevated INR in hospital (out-patient dose 2mg PO QHS).
Prandin was held, and he was started on Glargine at night, titrated up to 9 units QHS, along with RISS, with plan to manage on Glargine as an out-patient.
Patient will need teaching at rehab center.
While in hospital, patient transfused a total of 3 units of PRBCs to maintain Hct >30 given known CAD.
7) Chronic renal insufficiency: Creatinine around [**Name10 (NameIs) 5348**] of 2 in hospital, slightly higher on [**2113-1-23**] at 2.2.
Plan to D/C Gentamicin if creatinine >=2.5.
8) Cryptogenic cirrhosis: Patient continued on spironolactone and Lactulose in hospital.
9) Prophylaxis: On Coumadin, protonix (history of PUD) and bowel regimen in hospital.
