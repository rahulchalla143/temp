| AMPICILLIN------------   <=2 S NITROFURANTOIN--------  <=16 S TETRACYCLINE----------  =>16 R VANCOMYCIN------------   <=1 S   Brief Hospital Course: 67 year old female with PMhx of Lung Cancer, (s/p right upper lobectomy, middle lobe wedge resection, 4 cycles chemo + adjuvent radiation) with lower back and right hip pain since [**6-26**] (s/p kyphoplasty) transferred from OSH for evaluation and management of lower back pain and possible metastases to the spinal column at L1.
# Lower Back Pain - Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from [**Hospital **] hospital for evaluation by Ortho Spine for possible intervention for her new L1 compression fracture.
Pateint was initially treated for her pain with Dilaudid PCA while undergoing evaluation.
On [**8-24**], Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was taken for an anterior L1 corpectomy, anterior arthrodesis T12-L2, application of interbody cage T12-L2, application of lateral anterior hardware T12-L2 with a screw rod construct, and application of autograft rib.
Approach for this procedure was through Left thoracotomy exposed by thoracic surgery.
The procedure did not have any complications.
She was managed further with a Dilaudid PCA with activity as tolerated.
On post-op day 4, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] underwent a second procedure for posterior arthrodesis T10 to L3, segmental instrumentation T10 to L3 with pedicle and hook constructs, and application of allograft and demineralized bone matrix.
Pain was managed with dilaudid PCA.
For her pain, the patient was ultimately titrated up to MS Contin three times a day, PO dilaudid for breakthrough pain, neurontin and Lidocaine patches.
The patient was ultimately given Toradol 30 mg q8h for 2 days which greatly improved her pain.
Pain regimen was slightly tweaked her last few days in hospital with MS Contin 30 tid, dilaudid for breakthrough, neurontin and ibuprofen as final regimen.
Initially pain management for this right hip pain was with dilaudid PCA, as above, with low dose neurontin.
Neurontin was titrated up to 300 tid, Lidocaine patches placed for up to 18 hours per day across her right hip in the distribution of the nerve and MS Contin ultimately titrated up to tid dosing.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was scheduled for an intervention by the pain service after this CT, however she became febrile.
Instead, Rad-Onc was called for possible radiation therapy.
The risks of wound breakdown were explained to the patient and her husband.
Radiation was planned for [**9-11**], however in setting of possible infection, radiation was not started.
# Metastatic Lung Cancer - Patient was treated for primary lung cancer from [**Month (only) 404**]-[**2114-5-18**].
Due to quick failure s/p chemo and poor functional status during this admission, the patient was not considered for further chemotherapy.
Rad-Onc was consulted for radiation therapy, pt was evaluated and planned to start radiation while she was inpatient (risk of wound breakdown explained to patient and husband).
Initially, she was treated for her sinus tachycardia with a beta-blocker.
After her second procedure on [**8-28**], she remained tachycardic and was transferred to the Internal Medicine service for an unrelated elevated INR.
At this time, her standing tylenol and beta-blocker were stopped.
Heparin drip was initiated and target PTT was maintained.
Prior to discharge, heparin was switched to Lovenox SC 1 mg/kg [**Hospital1 **] for continued anticoagulation in the setting of malignancy.
# Fever - Patient had intermittent low-grade fever throughout her admission after her operative procedures.
On [**9-8**], patient had  fever of 102 and was started on Levoquin for empiric coverage due to no identified source of infection.
She was started on Vanc and Cefepime.
She quickly stabilized and defervesced and was switched to Vancomcin and Zosyn.
She was continued on Vancomycin and Zosyn until discharge and was sent home with 10 day course of Bactrim DS PO bid.
# Tachycardia - Patient remained tachycardic after initial procedure on [**8-24**].
Tachycardia did not respond to IV fluids.
Tachycardia improved after initiation of heparin for PE with intermittant elevation in heart rate when pain was not controlled.
Although low suspicion for DIC, work-up was initiated and were negative.
