The tip of the NG tube lies adjacent to this area of discontinuation.
Intra- and extra-hepatic biliary duct dilation due to pancreatic neoplasm.
[**2189-2-10**] External Biliary Drain placement: 1.
Successful placement of 8.0 French external biliary drainage catheter into the common bile duct via the right anterior intrahepatic segmental duct.
[**2189-2-13**] CT a/p with PO and IV contrast: IMPRESSION: 1.
No intrahepatic biliary duct dilation; status post external biliary drainage catheter into the common bile duct.
Brief Hospital Course: Post her ERCP for pancreatic head mass the patient was transferred to the TSICU with NGT in place given concern for duodenal perforation.
She was initially emperically begun on unasyn/fluconazole, subsequently narrowed to unasyn alone.
She was kept NPO with IVF and the NGT in place, with HR control with IV lopressor and digoxin.
She underwent external biliary drain (in common bile duct) placement by IR on [**2189-2-11**].
The drain was not able to be internalized at that time secondary to peri-ampullary swelling.
However, shortly after anesthesia induction/intubation, pt's BP decreased along w/ RVR, treated accordingly by anesthesia.
The decision to abort the procedure was made and patient was reversed and extubated.
The family decided not to pursue attempt to internalize drain the next day.
[**2189-2-14**] CDiff returned positive and she was begun on IV flagyl (in addition to her IV unasyn).
On discharge external biliary catheter was in place, and the family was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Future discussion regarding internalization of the drain may be undertaken at that time.
Her home coumadin was restarted (2.5 mg) on HD8, [**2189-2-16**], and she should have her INR checked on [**2189-2-17**] at rehab.
She was discharged to rehab on [**2189-2-16**], HD8, tolerating a regular diet with external biliary drain in place, to complete a course of augmentin given her duodenal perforation, and po flagyl given her Cdiff + stool.
In addition to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], follow up appointment was also arranged with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (hematology-oncology) of [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital on discharge (who had seen her while at [**Last Name (un) 4199**] after her pancreatic mass head was seen on imaging), and discharge summary was sent to Dr.[**Name (NI) 39123**] office.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for an ERCP procedure to evaluate a mass at the head of your pancreas.
The procedure was complicated by a perforation of your duodenum, and you were started on IV antibiotics and underwent a bile-duct drain placement by the interventional radiologists.
The drain was not able to be internalized because you did not tolerate the anesthesia for this procedure, and your family elected to hold off on having it internalized for now.
You are being discharged with an external drain in place, which visiting nurses will help you empty and care for.
You are being discharged on oral antibiotics which you should continue to take (both for your duodenal perforation and for a colon infection called "C Diff" which you developed while in the hospital).
You are scheduled to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of hepatobiliary surgery on Monday [**3-9**] at 3:15 PM.
