Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT: Mr. [**Known lastname 36365**] 53 yo M with PMH of metastatic esophageal cancer (liver, lung, bone mets), known LE DVT on lovenox, ESRD [**2-2**] IgA s/p renal transplant who presented with diffuse arthralgias and RUQ/pleuritic chest pain and found to have PE and RUL pna.
## Pulmonary Embolism: Patient developed embolism in setting of known DVT and missing a dose of lovenox at home (although unclear as this may not represent Lovenox failure, as he had a known DVT at the time which could have embolized).
Very difficult management given recent hematemesis, but likely benefits of anticoagulation outweigh risks of holding lovenox given no more episodes of hematemesis since ED.
He was sent home to continue his old Lovenox dose with specific instructions not to miss [**First Name (Titles) 691**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4319**].
Cefepime and vancomycin were discontinued at the time of discharge, as his chest x-ray had resolved, suggesting no infectious process was present.
EGD was performed and demonstrated no bleeding source; no intervention was performed.
## ESRD s/p renal transplant: Continued rapamune, dexemathasone.
Continue bactrim ppx.
## HTN: Off meds at home.
## OSA: On CPAP at home.
