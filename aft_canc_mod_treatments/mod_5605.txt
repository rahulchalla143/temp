Her BP meds were held.
IVF 100cc/h were started for an elevated Calcium and dehydration.
Her morning Phenytoin level was 19.3 and Phenytoin was held since then.
Soon after the CT, the patient's BP dropped, IVF and another 2 mg Atropin were given without much effect.
A dopamine drip was started and she was transferred to the unit.
In the ICU, the patient's BP was supported with IVF as needed.
She was monitored on tele and had atropine at the bedside.
Her hypothermia was concerning for sepsis and pt was initially broadly covered with abx, but then selectively treated with Linezolid for a positive [**Month/Day (4) **] in the urine which was not treated before since thought to be a colonizer.
Her seizure prophylaxis was provided with Keppra and dilantin was continued to be held.
Initially, thoguht to be an adverse reaction between diltiazem and dilantin, but dilantin would lower levels of diltiazem as a P450 activator.
She continued to receive chemotherapy for her CNS lymphoma.
The pt wa given atropine x3 with some response in the heart rate, though remained bradycardic.
Dopamine drip was started on the onc floor and the pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring.
It was decided that a permanent pacemaker is not indicated in this patient.
Hypothermia - Pt was hypothermic during her bradycardic episodes.
Pt completed an antibiotic course with Linezolid.
Rec was to pretreat with Diltiazem 60 mg [**Hospital1 **] to reduce effects of diastolic dysfxn, if pt is going to rechallenged with MTX again.
Diltiazem was started and amlodipin d/c'ed instead.
However, due to tendency to get volume overloaded, it was decided not to give MTX, but to start instead chemo with Rituxan and temodar which was given on [**9-13**].
She was also continued on her PCP prophylaxis for [**Name9 (PRE) 4820**] steroid use.
Dilantin was held since bradycadic event.
Pt was kept on Keppra since then.
Etiology unclear but possibly due to primary hyperthyroidism since PTH was elevated.
Pt received Calcitonin during her hospital stay as well as Lasix but Ca was still 12.2 on [**9-23**] (after correction for albumin of 3.0).
After stabilization in the unit and retransfer to the floor, she was started on HCTZ 25 qd on [**9-21**] and on Captopril 6.25 tid on [**9-21**].
