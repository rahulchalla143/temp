Two days after transfer out of the CCU the patient was started on lopressor 12.5 because he was having premature atrial contractions.
For the remainder of his course the patient was maintained on aspirin, statin, plavix and beta-blocker.
He received significant amount of blood transfusions throughout his hospital course and was in positive fluid balance.
Due to his rising creatinine, he initially received one time doses of Lasix and was re-assessed.

Per their reccs, Imdur and Hydralazine were added to reduced afterload and improve forward flow.
