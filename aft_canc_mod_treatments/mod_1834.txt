Admission Date:  [**2101-4-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2101-5-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2024-3-16**]       Sex:  F  Service:  ACOVE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 77-year-old woman, with a past medical history significant for head and neck cancer (diagnosed in [**2091**], status post radical neck dissection and radiation treatment), recently seen on [**2101-4-14**] at [**Hospital3 **] for shortness of breath, hoarseness, and respiratory stridor.
She was initially treated with Levaquin for suspected bronchitis, given nebulizers, and discharged with close ENT follow-up.
She was scheduled for elective tracheostomy on [**2101-4-25**] after a CT chest on [**2101-4-21**] demonstrated a probable mass involving the larynx on the left.
The patient received 8 mg of decadron and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for elective tracheostomy on [**2101-4-26**].
She was also started on Unasyn for a question of aspiration pneumonia and prophylaxis?
Head and neck cancer diagnosed in [**2091**], status post radical neck dissection and radiation treatment.
Status post G-tube placement for nutrition.
10.Peripheral vascular disease, status post femoral-popliteal bypass in [**2095**].
Zocor 40 mg qd.
Plavix 75 mg qd.
Aspirin 325 mg qd.
Vitamin B12 1,000 mg qd.
Folate 1 mg po qd.
Roxicet 5 mg prn.
CT neck with IV contrast - low attention within the left and right lobes of the thyroid, slightly prominent, slight irregularity of the mucosa inferior to the anterior commissure on the left and the right posteriorly at the level of the false cords, unusual calcification in the right cricoid cartilage suggestive of prior injury.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit for management of her respiratory distress.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE - 1) AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION:  The ENT service was consulted and given the patient's declining oxygen saturation and extensive involvement of her squamous cell CA of the left pharynx, it was their impression that she would require placement of a tracheostomy tube.
Initially, a cuffed 6.0 Shiley tube was placed on [**2101-4-26**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
This was later revised to an uncuffed 6.0 Shiley tube on [**2101-5-2**].
The aspirin and Plavix were held periprocedure and were restarted 2 days following procedure.
The patient appeared much more comfortable postprocedure and had adequate oxygenation and ventilation at 100% on a 60% face mask.
Initially, she did have thick secretions requiring frequent suctioning.
However, with the use of humidified oxygen and humidified room air, the secretions decreased significantly, and she was able to have [**Hospital1 **] suctioning as of [**2101-5-2**].
On [**2101-5-4**], it was reported that it was negative for mycobacterium tuberculosis.
The patient was initially placed on respiratory droplet precautions.
Thus, given the negative PPD, as well as the negative genetic probe, the patient was taken off respiratory precautions as of [**2101-5-4**].
3) LEFT LOWER LOBE PNEUMONIA:  The patient was initially on Unasyn for left lower lobe pneumonia.
A BAL was performed on [**2101-4-26**], and the BAL demonstrated moderate growth of oropharyngeal flora, but coag-positive Staph aureus that was sensitive to oxacillin.
Given the sensitivities of the coag-positive Methicillin sensitive Staph aureus, she was changed to levofloxacin on [**2101-4-30**].
She was started on metoprolol which was gradually titrated up until adequate blood pressure and heart rate control were achieved at a dose of 37.5 mg po bid.
However, no change in respiratory status was noted once metoprolol was initiated.
7) CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT:  The patient does have a history of CVA, and her aspirin and Plavix were continued.
However, the ICU team evaluated this and consulted vascular surgery who felt that this should be checked with serial ultrasounds; however, no acute intervention was required.
9) FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  At this point, the patient is on tube feeds at goal.
She is receiving ProBalance full-strength at 45 cc/h with residual check q 4 h.  Hold for residual greater than 150 cc.
The ostomy nurses were consulted and did change the dressing, and also placed a stoma cap at the skin site to prevent leakage--please see above for further recommendations regarding follow-up with the surgeon who initially placed this G-tube for possible revision.
10) GOALS OF CARE:  Given the patient's poor prognosis with her squamous cell CA of the neck that seems to have recurred since [**2091**], and limited possibility for additional therapeutic intervention, a discussion was conducted with the patient and her 2 sons, and it was decided that she would not want aggressive measures.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged to a pulmonary rehabilitation facility where it is recommended that the possibility of a Passy-Muir valve be considered, as well as optimizing the patient's trach care and G-tube care.
Please note that she does not require droplet precautions, as the genetic TB probe was negative.
