Status post CABG in [**2094**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG to PDA, SVG to OM).
Status post MVR in [**2094**] (St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]).

Lasix was held given elevated creatinine.
The patient was continued on his beta-blocker and he was also continued on hydralazine for afterload reduction.
He was not on an ACE given his creatinine insufficiency.
While the patient had an intermittent stay in the CCU for rapid atrial tachycardia, on discharge from the CCU, he was continued on Natrecor with Lasix boluses and was able to be diuresed further and on discharge was felt to be at his baseline in terms of dry weight with improved JVD, though never completely improved (thought to be secondary to patient's tricuspid regurgitation).
He was continued on amiodarone.
Coumadin was given for an INR goal of 2.5 to 3.5, though he was supratherapeutic on admission and it was initially held.
His dopamine and Natrecor were held and Lopressor was given at this time.
In the CCU, patient was reloaded on amiodarone although he initially was controlled with an esmolol gtt and a Neo-Synephrine gtt.
On discharge from the CCU, the patient's heart rate was 86 on the amiodarone as well as metoprolol.
The patient was controlled with a nitroglycerin drip in the CCU.
In addition, the patient is known to have severe three-vessel disease, but it was decided that medical management would be the best way for treating the patient's known coronary artery disease given his many comorbidities.
He was also continued on aspirin and Lipitor and a beta-blocker.
The patient's Foley catheter was discharged.
All of his medications were renal dosed during his hospital course.
The patient was discharged on a lower dose of Coumadin than he had been on previously.
On the floor, the patient had peripheral IV access, but in the CCU, the patient required a right EJ to IJ line.
The patient was continued on his Synthroid dose as usual.
