The  carcinoma is immunoreactive for cytokeratin cocktail and cytokeratin 7.
It is non-reactive for cytokeratin 20, estrogen receptor, GCDFP, mammoglobin, TTF-1 and CDX-2.
Brief Hospital Course: 51F with h/o bilateral breast CA, thyroid CA, NHL, pulmonary fibrosis s/p XRT, asthma, hypothyrodism, chronic kidney disease stage [**Year (4 digits) 1105**], presented with worsening vomiting and reflux symptoms and found to have metastatic ovarian cancer.
Given her CKD stage [**Name (NI) 1105**], pt received pre-contrast hydration protocol with sodium bicarbonate to minimize the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.
The patient had a G tube placed on [**2143-7-18**] that relieved her symptoms of obstruction.
The initial attempt at placing a J-tube was unsuccessful and a repeat attempt was performed on [**2143-7-22**], with a repeat attempt on [**2143-8-1**], also unsuccessful.
Patient continued to deteriorate and by [**2143-8-4**], the family, patient and health care proxy agreed that comfort measures only would be pursued going forward.
By the afternoon, her antibiotics, maintenence fluids, and TPN were withdrawn, as were most of her non-essential medications.
CXR showed new RML and RLL infiltrates, and she was started on levofloxacin.
Her WBC was persistently elevated and her coverage was changed to vanco/CTX and flagyl which she continued for 10 days.
She clinically improved with antibiotics and albuterol nebulizers.
She completed the treatment and has since then been stable on 3L NC O2.
Given the fact that her tachycardia was refactory to IV dilt, after receiving additional 90 of PO Dilt she was transferred to the unit for further management.
The afib was attributed to recent aspiration event and was managed with metoprolol and diltiazem.
Her medications were continued in the ICU and as pt's respiratory status and overall clinical status improved, pt re-entered sinus rhythm and was no longer tachycardic.
# Acute On Chronic kidney disease, stage 4: Etiology unclear.
Creatinine peak was 1.9 during this hospitalization and later downtrended to 1.3 before bumping back up to 1.9.
# AF with RVR: The patient experienced AF with RVR while in the ICU which was treated with B-blockers and calcium channel blockers.
# HTN: stable, continued Metoprolol Succinate XL 25 mg PO DAILY  # depression: stable, continued sertraline 100 mg PO DAILY  # Symptomatic hypocalcemia: Evaluation led to diagnosis of probable hypoparathyroidism (CONFIRM)based on her prior thyroid surgery for thyroid cancer.
Endocrinology was consulted while in the ICU for syptomatic hypocalcemia and she received IV and oral repletion with Vit D and CaCO3.
A right PICC line was attempted under IR but the IR team could not advance to the SVC (likely due to past XRT/lymphadectomy).
A midline was placed instead.
Quality of life was discussed and the patient voiced her preference to continue to pursue diagnostic tests and discuss treatment options.
