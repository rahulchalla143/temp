The patient had presented in the Emergency Department with confusion, word-finding difficulty, and cognitive slowing.
She has subsequently underwent four cycles of Gemcitabine and Carboplatin chemotherapy.
The patient was followed following these procedures and was neurologically and psychiatrically stable at the beginning of [**2141-2-6**].
Following further workup there was no evidence of further metastatic disease and given the patient's young age, the Oncology Division as well as the Thoracic Surgery staff felt that the patient's survival may benefit from surgical resection of the lung mass.
The patient has required Lasix for control.
The patient has also required increasing doses of narcotic medications to control lower extremity pain believed related to that edema.)

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2141-2-7**], and taken to the Operating Room where she underwent a left lower lobectomy, mediastinal lymph node dissection and lysis of adhesions.
The procedure was uncomplicated with an estimated blood loss of 150 cc.
The patient was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit while intubated and sedated.
The patient was on Dilantin and Decadron as well as the Nitroprusside drip for blood pressure control.
On postoperative day #2, the patient required reintubation for extreme agitation where the patient attempted to get out of bed, pulling her line and flashing on her bed.
Following intubation, the patient had a bronchoscopy performed for copious secretions.
The patient had been started on Levofloxacin postoperatively and subsequently completed a 14 day course.
Over the following few days, in the Intensive Care Unit the patient's medications were titrated to minimize her agitation.
On postoperative day #5, the patient pulled out one of her chest tubes.
The patient's second chest tube on the right side was removed later that day by the thoracic surgery team.
A pigtail catheter was placed into the pneumothorax for decompression on postoperative day #6.
On postoperative day #7 the patient was started on tube feeds and her Decadron was ultimately weaned off.
However, the patient did not cooperate much with the examination and it was believed that she could tolerate thin liquids and pureed foods under strict supervision while upright.
The patient's Ativan drip was weaned off and her Decadron was discontinued.
By that day the patient was able to converse somewhat fluently, although requiring frequent prompting to recall some details.
The patient was able to ambulate a short distance out of her room with a walker although she would drift to one side with ambulation and required guidance.
The patient's pigtail catheter into the chest had been removed without complications.
The patient was to be discharged for neurological rehabilitation when a bed became available.
