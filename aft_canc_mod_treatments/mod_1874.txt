Subsequently, the patient was intubated for respiratory distress.
History was limited given the patient was intubated at the time of evaluation, but she denies chills, headache, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, photophobia, or abdominal pain.
She reports compliance with all of her medications, including her HAART and bactrim/azithro.
Patient was slightly hypotensive after intubation and improved when sedation was weaned.
During her last admission for pneumonia in [**2192-6-29**], she was initially treated with Ceftriaxone and Flagyl, and later transitioned to Augmentin at the time of discharge.
There was no lung re-expansion so pleurex catheter was placed.
She also underwent bronchoscopy which revealed complete right main bronchus obstruction, so right bronchial stenting was performed.
Both squamous cell and adenocarcinoma of the lung and RUL lobectomy, with metastatic NSCLC with brain mets, status post stereotactic radiosurgery to a right cerebellar resection cavity and a right occipital metastasis, followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 724**]; history of SVC syndrome; she is being treated with Tarceva for palliative control of tumor burden 2.

Brief Hospital Course: 36 year-old woman with history of HIV/AIDS (CD4=56) on HAART and PCP/MAC prophylaxis), metastatic squamous and adenocarcinoma of the lung (on tarceva) with brain mets and chronic malignant effusion status post right bronchial stenting [**7-3**], recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after an admission for pneumonia who presents from outside hospital for acute onset shortness of breath.
Therefore, the possibility of a pulmonary embolism could not be excluded; however, she was not started on heparin empirically due to the presence of brain metastasis.
She was started on empiric antibiotics (vancomycin, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and Bactrim) for community acquired pneumonia, atypical pneumonia, and PCP.
The bronchial lavage was negative for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Bactrim was stopped.
Her respiratory status continued to decline as she became more hypoxic and more hypercarbic requiring increased ventilator adjustments.
On hospital day 4, the husband and family decided to withdraw ventilator support and the patient expired.
2) HYPOTENSION: She had transient hypotension after intubation that was likely secondary to sedation.
She was maintained on her HAART medications throughout the admission.
4) SQUAMOUS/ADENOCARCINOMA OF LUNG: She has metastasis to her brain and is status post stereotactic radiotherapy.
She had been recently treated with Tarceva.
She was seen by her oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**], on this admission who feels that no further treatment is warranted given the progression of her disease.
Interventional Pulmonary also saw her and felt that there was no indication for further intervention.
5) CHRONIC PAIN: She was maintained on fentanyl and propofol drip for pain control.
6) ANEMIA: During her last admission, her baseline hematocrit was between 24-27.
Tube feeds were to be started; however, she was not tolerating po intake through her OG tube.
9) PROPHYLAXIS: She was maintained on a PPI and subcutaneous heparin.
On hospital day 4, she was made comfort measures only.
