<br> PNEUMONIA: Likely related to a respiratory infection in the setting of possible aspiration event given copious upper airway secretions and notable cough, fever, and leukocytosis.
Patient was transiently on levofloxacin due to concern for Legionella; however, a negative urine legionella antigen prompted the discontinuation of levofloxacin on [**2197-7-18**].
The pneumonia was treated with a full 14 day course of cefepime starting on [**2197-7-17**].
Metronidazole and Vancomycin were also part of the patient's antibiotic regimen; however, the cefepime was the only antibiotic used for the full 14 days of treatment.
All IV antibiotics were stopped on [**2197-7-29**].
He should continue to receive chest PT at his long term care facility.
<br> HYPOXIA: Pt initially 84% on RA at [**Hospital1 1501**] and weaned from 100% NRB to 50% FM to 3L NC with O2 sats in mid 90's.
He remained on supplemental oxygen for several days after transfer from the MICU; however, with suctioning, and good chest PT, the patient was liberated from supplemental oxygen and had acceptable O2 sats (> 92%) for greater than a week prior to discharge.
The medication was restarted upon transfer to the floor team.
This was thought to be a gout flare in response to illness and re-initiation of allopurinol therapy.
Allopurinol was again discontinued and remained discontinued for the rest of the hospitalization.
Patient received two days of colchicine at a low dose and had no notable response to this medication.
The patient received naproxen 250 mg twice a day for 7 days.
Added low dose metroprolol [**2197-7-18**] (12.5mg PO TID) and continued that dose through the hospitalization.
The patient's tachycardia eventually improved as his overall presentation improved with decreasing WBC count, treatment of pneumonia, treatment of pseudogout, and treatment of fungal UTI.
The patient became agitated and confused while in the MICU and this was controlled with Zyprexa initially.
<br> DIARRHEA / C DIFF TESTING: Patient developed soft liquid stools shortly after the initiation of colchicine and continued to have soft stools up to the day of discharge.
He was on oral vancomycin for 4 days for empiric treatment of c. diff in setting of persistent leukocytosis; however, this medication was discontinued on day of discharge.
This issue should be followed and bowel regimen should be adjusted as needed by outpatient physicians.
<br> URINARY INCONTINENCE / UTI: Patient was incontinent of urine during the hospitalization and has an unknown baseline of urinary continence.
He did have a urine dipstick positive for WBCs as well as a urine culture positive for greater than 10^5 colonies of [**Last Name (LF) 23087**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was treated with a three-day course of fluconazole prior to discharge.
His urinary incontinence should be followed to see if it resolves following discharge.
Could possibly be related to underlying infection, fever, and SIRS syndrome.
He was NPO with tube feeds through NG tube as sole nutrition upon transfer from the MICU.
<br> PPX: While in hospital, the patient received SQ Heparin, Pneumoboots, and a Bowel regimen <br> CODE STATUS: FULL CODE (This was confirmed when [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy (HCP) [**Name (NI) 28622**] [**Name (NI) 65305**] visited him from [**State 7080**] <br> COMMUNICATION: Sister: [**Name (NI) 28622**] [**Name (NI) 65305**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 74320**] is [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy and came to visit the patient and was involved in discussion of his care as well as his code status.
