She recently developed vaginal bleeding which led to a CT scan and MRI which showed a large parasacral mass She underwent resection of the large parasacral mass along with reconstruction of the left uretero-ureteral anastomosis.
She was therefore scheduled for an exploratory laparotomy and repair.

She also had a revision colostomy along with removal replacement of the left ureteral stent and a sigmoid conduit urinary diversion.
The patient had an estimated blood loss of 1,000 cc and received 1 unit of packed red blood cells intraoperatively.
She was discharged to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively, intubated, and sedated with a nasogastric tube in place.
That evening she was noted to have a low blood pressure with low urine output and a low CVP and received multiple boluses of IV fluids and 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
On postoperative day one, the patient was extubated, started on IV Unasyn and Flagyl, and was transferred to the floor.
Her blood pressure and heart rate remained well controlled with IV metoprolol and her pain was controlled with the epidural until approximately postoperative day five.
