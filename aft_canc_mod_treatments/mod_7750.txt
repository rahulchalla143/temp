Although there were no adverse intraoperative events; the dissection was described as tough, the mass was large and there was high blood loss and fluid resuscitation due to size of resection bed.
The patient received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis.
On POD1 he was transferred to the general surgical floor where he remained with good pain control coverage with his epidural.
He was hydrated for urine output >30cc/hour, and provided with pneumoboots and incentive spirometry for prophylaxis.
Over the course of several days he was gradually weaned from oxygen support, transitioned to PCA from epidural and then to oral pain medications once he reported flatus.
It was on [**11-7**], POD3, that his epidural was discontinued and while his PCA was maintained.
He was weened from Ox support and kept on telemetry.
His foley was also d/c'd on POD3.
The patient was discharged in stable condition, eating well, ambulating independently, voiding without difficulty, and with pain control on oral analgesics.
The patient was given explicit instructions to follow-up in clinic in one week with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] for staple removal (six remaining).
