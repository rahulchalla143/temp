He was intubated, became hypotensive with BPs droppng to systolic 60s, and started on multiple pressors.
Per report, he went into PEA and received CPR X 8 minutes, 1 of atropine, 2 of epi, and regained spontaneous circulation.
He was placed on a ballon pump with subsequent improvement in his pressures (MAP 70s-80s) and transferred to the CCU on Levophed and Epinephrine.
In the CCU he was given 80 of IV lasix and started on a lasix gtt.
Hct's were checked q2hrs, and because they were stable he was started on a heparin gtt (given the balloon pump).
Unable to obtain ROS [**1-3**] clinical status- intubated and non-responsive.
Past Medical History: CAD, CABG in [**2139**] Multiple stents [**2150**]-[**2154**] PVD renal and peripheral stents TURP Bilateral hernia repair Carotid stenosis less than 60% on right ICA,  Less than 40% left ICA on [**2155-11-28**] Pneumonia/bronchitis [**2157**] Memory problems [**Name (NI) **] of hearing, cannot hear in left ear at all, hearing aide right ear   Social History: -unable to obtain  Family History: -unable to obtain  Physical Exam: VS: 94, 80 (V paced), 112/40, 20, 92% GENERAL: intubated, not responding to verbal, tactile, noxious stimuli HEENT: Atraumatic, PER @ 7 mm, non-reactive (hx of b/l cataract [**Doctor First Name **]) CARDIAC: RRR (paced) unable to appreciate any murmurs, + [**Hospital1 1516**] pads LUNGS: diffuse rales ABDOMEN: soft, unable to appreciate BS over IABP EXTREMITIES: no edema, unable to palpate or doppler pulses   Pertinent Results: TTE [**2159-1-10**] Poor image quality.
Some of the more rhythmic features raise the possibility of medication effect.
Extensive aortic atherosclerotic disease, with linear echogenic focus within the mid abdominal aorta possibly representing a dissection flap of indeterminate chronicity.
CXR [**2159-1-9**] The patient is intubated, the tip of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 2 cm above the carina.
CXR [**2159-1-23**] Endotracheal tube is in standard placement.
Transvenous right atrial, right ventricular, and left ventricular pacer leads are in standard placements unchanged.
Left PIC line tip is partially obscured by pacer leads, but is probably in the mid SVC.
His procedure was complicated by cardiogenic shock.
Post operative course was further complicated by pulmonary hemorrhage prolonged intubation and second arrest while having a doboff placed.
While the patient never appeared to recover completely after inital cardiogenic shock, his neurological exam notably deteriorated after second arrest.
Ultimately after second arrest and deteriorating neurological status, the patient was made comfort measures only.
The patient was started on multiple pressors, and an IABP was placed with subsequent improvement in his pressures with MAPs in the 70s-80s.
On time of transfer to the CCU he was on Levophed and Epinephrine for pressure support, which were slowly weaned during his hospital stay.
He was started on a lasix gtt for diuresis with subsequent good urine output.
From a cardiac stand point the patient initially did well, was diuresed and off pressor support.
Several days post extubation, the patient traveled to interventional radiology for placement of dohboff for initiation tube feeds.
Procedure was complicated by arrest, the patient was reintubated, CPR was initiated, the patient received two rounds of epinephrine and levophed and dopamine were started.
Once stabilized, ionotropic support was quickly weaned off and the patient required intermittant pressor support for the duration of his hospital stay.
# PULMONARY HEMORHAGE: Initially, there was concern for hypovolemic shock secondary to blood loss given instrumentation of SVC and distal pulmonary arteries.
Once stable, the patient was started on a heparin gtt given his IABP.
His balloon pump was discontinued allowing heparin to be discontinued.
Pulmonary was consulted for bronchoscopy, which revealed a large amount of blood and active bleeding in the left mainstem, endotracheal tube was selectively placed into the right mainstem.
IR was consulted for possible angio embolization, who recommended CTA chest and aortogram which were deferred given the patient was not stable.
Overnight, off heparin the patient did well, and only old blood was suctioned from ET tube therafter.
The endotracheal tube was replaced to proper position.
He had received 1g of Vancomycin in the cath lab given the mutiple emergent lines placed in non-optimal sterile technique.
Vancomycin was continued and Cefepime/Flagyl were added to cover for a possible aspiration event and he completed an 8 day course.
After several days of persistent fevers, and interval development of hypotension requiring intermittant pressor support, the patient was empirically started on vancomucin and zosyn.
However, in the setting of eye exam and inability to respond to commands several days off sedation there was significant concern for brainstem injury not visualized on CT. .
He was continued on aspirin and plavix which were discontinued in the setting of pulmonary hemorrhage.
As an outpatient he had been on ASA and Plavix for anticoagulation.
We continued his Aspirin which was discontinued in setting of pulmonary hemorrhage.
The patient likely experienced insult to his kidneys during hypotension; however, his creatinine remained relatively stable at 2.0 in the setting of intial diuresis and then second arrest.
He later developed a hyperchloremic non anion gap metabolic acidosis with acidemia from mixed respiratory acidosis in the setting of multiple normal saline based gtts (midazolam and precedex) and normal saline boluses during second arrest.
# HYPERTENSION: Outpatient antihypertensive medications held in setting of cardiogenic shock.
# ELEVATED BLOOD GLUCOSE: The Elevated blood glucose levels: The patient was started on an insulin sliding scale.
# NUTRITION: The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition in the setting of prolonged intubation.
TPN was restarted post arrest and re-intubation.
General Surgery was consulted for placement of PEG tube, however procedure never performed as patient persistently febrile and unstable.
