He was started on aspirin due to concern for an arterial clot and scheduled for RUE doppler today.
Pt reportedly has also been more depressed so was started on an antidepressant by his primary oncology team today.
He also has experienced significant toxicities from both 5-FU and oxaliplatin based therapies.
His tumor was tested for DPD deficiency and he indeed was found to have a high susceptibility for toxicity from 5-FU based therapies based on heterozygous mutation in his DPYD gene.
His tumor also is wild type for K-RAS, and therefore, cetuximab based therapy has been initiated.

[**2116-12-25**] RUE arterial duplex (prelim): Right brachial artery clot near antecubital fossa.
Patient was started on heparin gtt after a head CT ruled out large mets, and he was evaluated by vascular surgery for thrombectomy.
Given that patient was asymptomatic with heparin gtt, vascular surgery decided that no surgical intervention was necessary, and patient can be managed by anticoagulation.
The ideal management would be life-long lovenox; however, patient was adamant about not taking lovenox since he does not want to have bruises on his abdomen.
After extensive discussions, patient did agree to take lovenox until INR is therapeutic on coumadin.
Patient was loaded with coumadin 7.5mg on the day of discharge, and was given prescription of coumadin at 5mg daily.
Patient was continued to aspirin, beta-blocker, started on statin, and he was already on heparin for arterial thrombus.
