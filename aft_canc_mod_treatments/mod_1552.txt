Anemia - on admission her Hct was 20.3 so she received total of 3 units PRBCs with an appropriate Hct bump to around 33-35.
GI was consulted and felt that she would benefit from stent placement only if she was nauseated/vomiting, but that it would not control the bleeding, so she was tried on food and tolerated all foods well.
It was discussed with her family that a conservative/palliative approach will be pursued, with symptomatic control with PPI twice a day, biweekly hct checks, and likely no readmission if she has a massive GI bleed.
A betal blocker was added to her regimen instead of her calcium channel blocker.
HTN: A beta blocker was substituted for her calcium channnel blocker for its cardioprotective effects.
