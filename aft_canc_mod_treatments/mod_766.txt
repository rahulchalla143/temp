Admission Date:  [**2156-9-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2156-9-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-5-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Percocet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**] Chief Complaint: Fever, neutropenia, and swollen, painful left elbow  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: 61-year-old right-handed woman with glioblastoma multiforme, s/p subtotal resection on [**2156-7-2**], involved-field cranial XRT, and chemotherapy (last taken on [**2156-9-10**]).
Husband first noted left elbow 3-4 weeks ago which resolved in 2 days after application of neosporin (there was a question of spider bite).
Regarding her oncologic history, her symptoms began in late [**Month (only) 205**] [**2155**] with headache, word-finding difficulties, memory loss, and confusion.
After subtotal resection on [**2156-7-2**], underwent involved-field XRT with concurrent temozolomid.
She also received 1 treatment with CyberKnife radiosurgery to an enhancing lesion in the right occipital lobe, together with temozolomide.
In the emergency room, her temperature was 102.6 F, HR 130s (sinus tachycardia), and systolic BP 90s-100s (baseline SBP 120s-130s).
She received oxygen at 7 liters via nasal cannula in the emergency room but her systolic BP persisted in 90s-100s.
Emergency Department did not start on sepsis protocol because her serum lactate was not > 4 and she was responsive to fluid, despite the elevated temperature, heart rate, and WBC.

It is not clear if this represents dense edema or frank fluid, as this study is limited without intravenous contrast.
Ultrasound could be performed for further evaluation.
EKG [**2156-9-25**]: Sinus tachycardia Modest diffuse nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities Since previous tracing of [**2156-9-19**], sinus tachycardia rate slower and ST-T wave abnormalities are less prominent  [**2156-9-26**] 1:20 pm SWAB      Source: Left elbow bursa pus.
Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**6-/2457**]) immediately if          sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this patient's isolate.

BCX [**2156-9-19**]: No growth (final) BCX [**2156-9-20**]: No growth (final)   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 61-year-old woman with glioblastoma multiforme, s/p involved-field XRT, surgery, involved-field cranial irradiation, and chemotherapy presented with  neutropenic fever, left elbow bursitis/cellulitis, UTI, and possible pneumonia on chest CT.  1.
In the setting of neutropenic fever, the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, ceftazidime, and azithromycin (for atypical pneumonia), as well as gentamicin x 1 dose in context of continued destabilization and need for double gram negative coverage.
Patient received stress dose steroids as well as Neupogen.
On [**2156-9-23**], given her enterococcal UTI is pansensitive and the patient no longer neutropenic, vancomycin and ceftazidime were discontinued and cefazolin IV was started to cover both enteroccocus and left elbow cellulitis.
Neupogen was discontinued on [**2156-9-24**].
Azythromycin was discontinued after completion of 7 day course on [**2156-9-26**].
Thus, cefazolin was discontinued, and vancomycin was restarted on [**2156-9-26**].
The left elbow responded well to vancomycin and the fluid sac broke open spontaneously, draining pus.
The patient had a PICC line placed in her right arm and was discharged with 10 more days of vancomycin to finish a 2 week course.
Hypoxia: The paitnet required O2 supplement temporarily.
Glioblastoma Multiforme: Chemotherapy was held.
Continued on Keppra and Decadron.
Given on steroids, FS blood glucose was checked 4 times daily and they were mostly in the 100's, not requiring a long acting insulin.
Anxiety: Lorazepam prn helped.
Prophylaxis: Sliding scale insulin and finger stick blood glucose given on steroids; PPI, subcutaneous heparin, and bowel regimen were administered as well.
Full code: Patient does not want prolonged intubation if M.D.s think poor recovery.
