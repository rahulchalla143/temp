She was given Ativan and Dilantin 1 g.  Her glucose was found to be in the 600s.
She was started on an insulin drip and was receiving intravenous fluids.
Multiple myeloma diagnosed in [**2174**]; status post vincristine, dexamethasone, doxorubicin treatment and chemotherapy in [**2175**].
She had an autologous bone marrow transplant in [**2175-8-2**].
She has been started on thalidomide in [**2178-1-2**].
Right total hip replacement in [**2179-3-5**].
Oxycodone 5.
Dexamethasone 40 mg p.o.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 96.1, heart rate was 120, blood pressure was 154/70, respiratory rate was 33, oxygen saturation was 98% on 4 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.
She was given hydration and an insulin drip.
She was converted from an insulin drip to regular insulin sliding-scale.
She was continued with fluid hydration.
It was felt that her glucose may have been elevated secondary to dexamethasone and possible infection.
She was started on glipizide 5 mg p.o.
Her insulin was adjusted for better coverage, and it was increased according to needs.
However, she could not tolerate a magnetic resonance imaging, and was unable to be fully excluded.
She was continued on oral Dilantin.
She was started on levofloxacin.
She was started on ceftriaxone at a meningitis dose initially.
Ceftriaxone was continued for a course of 10 days as was the metronidazole.
She completed a course of antibiotics of ceftriaxone and metronidazole.
She was on periodic dexamethasone which was thought to be the culprit for her hyperglycemia.
It was felt that her diffuse tumor burden was increasing despite the chemotherapy that she had been receiving.
She was given Lasix periodically.
She received fluids and also with her history of congestive heart failure, she was continued on Lasix 40 mg once per day with metoprolol.
She was also started on captopril, and it was increased as tolerated.
RENAL SYSTEM:  The patient had an increasing creatinine on her initial admission.
She was treated antibiotics and occasional Lasix.
Because of her poor prognosis, she was not a candidate for interventional studies.
She was given units of packed red blood cells as needed.
Because of the deterioration in her condition and move toward hospice care, it was decided to hold off on the interventional studies.
She had expanding tumor involvement including skin and likely pancreas.
It was decided with the attending and the family that the patient would best be served by do not resuscitate/do not intubate with comfort measures.
Hospice was asked to see the patient and further lengthy discussions were started.
