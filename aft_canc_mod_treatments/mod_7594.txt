We had planned to place a catheter in the lungs to drain fluid continuously, however your breathing was stable and your lungs sounded relatively clear.
The idea was that the chemotherapy would shrink the tumor if we gave it 1-2 weeks to work, and this would mean placing a tube would not be necessary.
We are sending you home with a medication called marinol that stimulates appetite, as it is very important that you get nutrition.
We made the following CHANGES to your medications: STOPPED your atenolol, instead we STARTED metoprolol for blood pressure (take metoprolol, do not take atenolol) STARTED albuterol inhaler for wheezing or shortness of breath INCREASED your trazodone for sleep from 25mg nightly to 25-50mg nightly (in other words take one half or one whole pill depending on how much you need) STARTED oxycodone for pain STARTED caphasol for mouth dryness STARTED tylenol as needed for pain STARTED dronabinol for appetite STARTED lidocaine mouthwash for sore throat STARTED fluconazole (take for 5 more days) STARTED potassium supplements STARTED oxycodone for pain related to mouth sore STARTED senna and docusate, two medications for constipation  Followup Instructions: you will follow up with your oncologist at [**Hospital3 635**] hospital to continue with treatment.
