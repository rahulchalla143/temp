Patient had been started on coumadin [**2-20**] days prior, and also INR was 2/0 on presentation, it may have been subtherapeutic when his decompensation began.
Patient was admitted to MICU, where he was treated empirically for PE with heparin gtt.
Patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, levaquin) to cover for healthcare associated PNA, since his last hospital admission was less than 1 month prior.
In the MICU, patient improved on this treatment regimen, and he had stable 02 sat on room air.
Heme-onc was consulted and recommended repeat CTA to rule out PE, since this diagnosis would be a contraindication for estramustine therapy.
Heparin gtt was stopped and patient was restarted on home dose coumadin.
However, INR became supratherapeutic, likely because of interaction with levaquin, and coumadin was held, vitamin K given.
