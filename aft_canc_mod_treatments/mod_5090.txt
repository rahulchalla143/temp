She was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**6-25**] who performed a rigid bronchoscopy here followed by replacement of her tracheostomy tube.
-Polypoid soft tissue density just above the insertion of the tracheostomy tube may relate to granulation tissue.
She was given O2, suctioning and nebulizers without significant improvement.
Initially, she was started on Levoquin and finished a 14 day course for suspected bronchitis.
As such, She was started on Vancomycin with subsequent negative surveillance cultures.
This particular Klebsiella UTI was only sensitive to Gentamicin, Imipenem, Zosyn and Cefotetan.
- Started on Imipenem on [**2156-7-24**] for this.
On [**7-19**], she was obtunded and had significant mucous secretions and mucus plugging requiring suctioning; ENT changed her cuffless trach from a #6 to a #4 and transitioned to a trach collar after transient ventilation.
On [**7-19**], she has a IJ TLC placed in OR at [**Hospital1 46**].
On [**7-22**], noticed to have "mild stridor" and mild tachypnea and was replaced on a ventilator.
Of note: - was found to be C Diff + and was started on flagyl .
Today, she is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further options regarding placement of a new tracheostomy tube.
CAD - s/p PTCA [**2153**], NSTEMI [**1-30**], s/p CABGx4 (LIMA->LAD, vein grafts to OM and Distal Cflx, reverse saphenous to post descending artery) [**1-30**] - s/p sternal wound debridement [**2156-2-22**] (Proteus and Staph) -> ID recommended 6 wks of Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin -> ?
if finished - brief episode of Afib/aflutter -> Amiodarone -> 2nd degree heart block -> converted back to sinus - complicated by: Proteus Mirabilis sepsis 2.
L Subdural hematoma ([**4-29**] - s/p fall)with R aneurysm; With R homonymous hemianopsia 3.
Aortic valve replacement (bovine) [**1-30**] 6.
10. s/p tracheostomy for respiratory failure.
Tracheomalacia -> s/p laser removal of granulation tissue x 2 ([**5-28**]) 11.
- Last Cr was 1.5 at [**Hospital3 **]) 13. s/p hysterectomy   Social History: She presently resides in Rehab facility on [**Hospital3 **].
Patient with 2 healing ulcers on L leg in region of scars from vein removal for CABG.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2156-7-24**] 8:17 PM A tracheostomy tube terminates within the trachea just above the level of the clavicles.
Left internal jugular vascular catheter terminates in the superior vena cava, and a nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm.

Pt back to MICU on [**8-3**] for aggressive fluid resuscitation given C-Diff colitis and poor PO intake with metabolic acidosis.
- s/p laser removal of tissue x 2 in the past - on [**7-28**]: was switched from vent to trach mask and tolerated this well - on [**7-30**]: had rigid [**Last Name (un) 1066**], electrocautery and balloon dilatation of trachea and upsizing of her trach to a #7 -> Will need a special long trach which was ordered and will be available on [**8-9**].
Per IP underwent a trach change with T-tube placement on [**8-9**] without complications.
If pt needs oxygenation she can be oxygenated with nasal cannula O2 with capped trach.
**Acinobacter/Klebsiella VAP: Started Bactrim on [**7-28**], completed 14 day course on [**8-10**] -- Continue mucinex PRN mucus buildup -- D/Cd atrovent, albuterol standing nebs -- pt was on solumedrol 60 IV BID prior to admission (unclear reason why, ?
# ID:  Pt had hx of enteroccus bacteremia, which was believed to be treated adequately with 23 day course of vanc at OSH.
Pt grew acinetobacter from her sputum, and was started on bactrim on [**7-28**] for 14 day course for Vent Associated PNA.
Pt also had hx of klebsiella UTI, and had been treated with imipenem at OSH.
Per ID recommendations, pt was likely colonized from frequent foley catheterizations, and imipenem was d/c'd.
Pt had hx of C.dif, and was continued on flagyl for additional 14 day course.
She had persistent diarrhea, resistent to PO flagyl treatment, she was started on PO Vanco as well as IV flagyl on [**8-2**] for C-diff colitis.
Her diarrhea improved with PO Vanco and IVflagyl, her WBC peaked at 29 and came down to 14.4 at time of discharge.
She was also started on Meropenem on [**8-3**] for Klebsiella UTI.
Per ID she was to continue PO Vanco/flagyl until all other Antibiotics d/c'd and diarrhea improved.
She will complete a recommended 10day course of meropenem on [**2156-8-12**].
C-DIFF Colitis: pt with explosive diarrhea treated for C-diff as noted above.
She was followed closely by surgery, however given her other comorbidities she was not a surgical candidate.
Pt was kept on a clear liquid diet with plan to advance when improved colities.
# Neuro: Seizure Prophylaxis - on phenytoin (likely since she had subdural sustained in [**4-29**])  - continued phenytoin during this admission, increased dose given low albumin and subtherapeutic with corrected dose.
restarted her on carbergoline for her prolactinoma.
Plan to continue Cabergoline at current dose 0.5mg 2x/week.
# Renal: - Cr 1.5 on admission; this is similar to level when she left [**Hospital1 46**] - Renally dose medications -> increaed Cr on [**7-31**] with peak to 2.4 due to poor PO intake and explosive diarrhea.
Her IVF were discontinued on [**8-9**] as she was significantly volume overloaded and making urine, although poorly ~700cc per day.
However, she also developed hyponatremia with IVF resuscitation.
# Cardio:  Pt s/p CABG in the past, she also went into AFlutter for which she was cardioverted on [**8-3**].
she was continued on an ASA and statin.
She was maintained on an ISS which was titrated for better BS control.
However fondaparinaux was held prior to IP procedure, but was restarted s/p procedure.
Currenlty receiving TPN since poor PO intake; clear liquid diet until colitis improved.
Note on [**7-29**]: had FEES study by speech/swallow team -> OK to have nectar thick liquids and ground solids, however changed diet to clear liq due to colitis.
# Access: L subclavian - placed in OR on [**7-19**] at [**Hospital3 **]  - removed on [**7-26**] with no growth on culture data - switched PICC on [**7-29**] because patient has HIT.
