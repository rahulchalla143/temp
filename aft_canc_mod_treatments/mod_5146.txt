The patient was intubated and placed on assist control mechanical ventilation with respiratory and mental status returning to baseline as a result.
The patient arrived with tracheostomy tube misplaced.
The tracheostomy tube was changed and lumen changed to size 8.
Speech and Swallow was consulted for Passy-Muir placement but were unable to see the patient due to his recent trach change.
Because he has been intermittently unable to speak, would recommend Passy-Muir placement at rehab facility.
The patient was weaned off the ventilator once his new tube was in place and currently at 600/20/40%/5.
Patient should be aggressively weaned from ventilator as tolerated.
Please encourage out of bed and continue physical therapy (begun in hospital).
He should receive humidified O2 while on trach collar .
A 15-day course of broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole) was completed.
The patient was continued on bronchodilator therapy.
Patient has IVC filter in place and history of retroperitoneal bleed and is therefore not anticoagulated.
Metoprolol 50 mg was initiated after patient's respiratory status stabilized.
No record of medications for glycemic control.
Pt was maintained on a  regular insulin sliding scale during his hospital stay.
The patient was maintain with a foley catheter.
Please consider reopening discussion of lung cancer treatment with his family.
Access: R IJ was removed and a left PICC line was inserted.
FEN: Patient had episode of clogged G-tube refractory to flushing efforts, but an abdominal x-ray with gastrografin contrast through G-tube showed contrast in stomach.
Subsequently, tube feeds were successful.
