Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**5-3**] percutaneous drain placement  History of Present Illness: Following admission to an outside hospital, he was extensively fluid resuscitated, intubated due to respiratory distress, required vasopressor support, transfused 2 units of RBC for a Hct of 21.1, started on TPN and started on IV antibiotics Invanz and flagyl.
Past Medical History: Ulcerative colitis, osteoporosis, polyps, depression  Social History: non-contributory   Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: On admission T 98.5  HR 73  BP 96/59  RR 14  on CMV 0.4  500x12(5) Peep 5 sats 100% on vaso 2.4, propofol 20 Gen - intubated, sedated, ETT, OGT in place Card - RRR Pulm - Coarse bilaterally Abd - soft, mild distention, hypoactive bowel sounds, non tender Abdominal wound - healing, clean base, no surrounding erythema.
Ileostomy with large amount of green stool, guiaic negative  Pertinent Results: [**5-3**] CT-GUIDED DRAINAGE:  Outside CT of the abdomen and pelvis was not available at time of the procedure.
Therefore, a contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained prior to the procedure with administration of 130 cc of Optiray.
The urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter and is unremarkable.
Using CT fluoroscopy for guidance, an 8 French catheter was placed into the pelvis into the largest fluid pocket utilizing Seldinger technique via the left transabdominal approach.
After satisfactory position of the catheter was confirmed, approximately 70 cc of yellow minimally cloudy fluid was aspirated.
The catheter was secured to the skin by percutaneous catheter fasteners, connected to a drainage bag, and left to open drainage.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
IMPRESSION: Successful CT-guided drainage catheter placement.
However, CT fluoroscopy images obtained during the procedure to confirm location of the guiding needle demonstrated significant rapid shift of fluid within the pelvis with only minimal amount of fluid remaining in the initially targeted left lower quadrant pocket.
Therefore, percutaneous drainage of this free flowing fluid was deemed unsafe and therefore was not performed.
IMPRESSION: CT-guided drainage was not performed as fluid demonstrated continuous shifting during the procedure which rendered percutaneous catheter placement unsafe at this time.
The patient is status post total colectomy, and ileal pouch to anal anastomosis.
This gap allows direct communication of the lumen of the ileal pouch with the pelvic fluid collection.
There is a Foley catheter in place.
He remained intubated, on pressor support, continued TPN and broad spectrum antibiotics (ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, flagyl).
