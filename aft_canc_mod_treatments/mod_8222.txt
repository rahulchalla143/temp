[**Numeric Identifier 111690**]  (Not on file) DIAGNOSIS: Renal biopsy, needle: Pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis in the setting of P-ANCA positivity, see note.
Arterioles show moderate mural thickening and hyaline change.
3 glomeruli show crescents on fibrin stain.
The specimen is viewed in the dissecting microscope, identified as renal by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3535**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], and divided into material for light (formalin fixation) and electron microscopy and immunofluorescence studies.
She became in a stable condition after aggressive treatment in ICU for acute lung disease and ARF secondary to P-ANCA associated small vessel vasculitis (Wegener's' granulomatosis versus microscopic polyangiitis).
She has continued improvement on Cytoxan and prednisone.
She was initially treated for presumed pneumococcal pneumonia with IV ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
She was placed on a NRB and was transferred to the ICU for possible need for mechanical ventilation for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.
The ABX spectrum was broadened to Vancomycin and Cefepime.
Chest CT on [**2112-5-22**] showed patchy consolidations, septal thickening, and multiple areas of traction bronchiectasis.
She eventually required intubation for presumed ARDS.
Patient was started on Cytoxan and Solu-Medrol for presumed P-ANCA associated-small vessel vasculitis.
Patient extubated on [**5-28**] and continued to improve with above treatment on Cytoxan and prednisone.
She will need 6 months Cytoxan and 1 month prednisone 60mg followed by slow taper.
She had nephrotic range proteinuria and was started on 10mg lisinopril which was titrated to 20 mg. She was initially on three antihypertensive medications, including amlodipine, metoprolol, and hydralazine.
We added lisinopril and discontinued hydralazine.
On discharge, she was started on Keflex for UTI, cultures and sensitivities pending.
