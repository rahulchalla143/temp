Admission Date:  [**2165-3-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-3-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-2-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**] Chief Complaint: rectal bleeding, hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: R femoral arterial sheath L femoral central venous line  History of Present Illness: 58F w/ metastatic non-small lung cancer recent d/c'd from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-7**] following cervical/thoracic decompression (for presumed mets) complicated by LGIB now returning for bleeding per rectum and hypotension.
To OR on [**2-26**] for spinal decompression and post op course complicated by LGIB requiring 6 units prbc and SICU transfer.
Had 3 large peripheral IV's placed and has received total of 6L IVF and 4 units PRBC.
Past Medical History: -metastatic non-small lung cancer w/ known spinal mets (based upon pathology from surgery) s/p cervical/thoracic decompression [**2-26**] -s/p RUL lobectomy of Pancoast tumor w/ xrt, chemo in '[**51**] c/b bronchopleural fistula -s/p recurrent/?new non-small LUL cancer in '[**62**] for which received chemo and xrt (etoposide/cisplatin in '[**63**] via Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] -s/p scapular osteomylitis -hyponatremia thought secondary to siadh -lower gi bleed as above (thought diverticular)  Social History: former tobacco history (40 pack years), no etoh, ivda  Family History: Mother died from ovarian cancer.
However clinically bleeding had subsided, therefore no intervention was undertaken.
She underwent washout of her R shoulder and cervical spine with post-op course requiring monitoring in the ICU for hypotension and persistent hypoxia (secondary to volume overload) requiring venitlatory support.
She was weaned off the ventilator but continued to require BiPap to maintain oxygenation despite diuresis.
She was taken off bipap and given dilaudid and ativan for pain control and respiratory distress.
# Respiratory Distress: Required intubation initially in setting of volume overload and then again post-operatively.
She was weaned off ventilator but still required BiPap.
She did not tolerate the BiPap and made wishes clear that she wished to be taken completely off respiratory support.
After discussion with the patient, family, and palliative care services, her goals of care were changed to comfort measures only and she was taken off bipap support.
She was kept comfortable with pain control and sedation and passed away shortly after this time.
She was aggressively resusicated with IVF and multiple units of PRBC and her pulse improved to high 90's and low 100's.
Empiric abx initiated including vanc, unasyn, and flagyl.
Her lactate never rose substantially but she did have systolics in 70's and 80's on HD1 that did require pressors and further IVF.
Given sensitivities she was transitioned from Vancomycin to Oxacillin.
However, there was evidence of local infection at spinal surgery site.
Therefore she went for surgical washout on [**2165-3-12**].
Initially treated with Zosyn and this was changed to Levofloxacing once sensitivity data returned for a complete course .
Metastatic lung cancer: She has long history of non-small lung cancer dating to early 90's at which point she underwent RUL resection followed by XRT, chemo for Pancoast's tumor.
She has received etoposide and cisplatin in '[**63**].
She does have metastatic dz (for which recent spinal surgery performed) but felt that would be reasonable to proceed with aggressive therapy for GIB and sepsis since condition not believed to be immenintly terminal.
However, the patient subsequently requested withdrawl of aggressive care and wished for goals of care to be directed towards comfort measures only.
Medications on Admission: megace 40 qd, oxycontin 30 [**Hospital1 **], vicodin prn, protonix 40 qd, ferrous sulfate.
