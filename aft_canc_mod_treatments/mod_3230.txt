He underwent chemotherapy and radiation with evidence of shrinkage on CT scan.
He now presents for preoperative preparation for his distal esophagectomy and total gastrectomy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a significant smoker who requires home oxygen and does have a history of alcohol in the past but quit 20 years ago.
His chemistries showed a sodium of 145, potassium 2.8, chloride 99, bicarbonate 35, BUN 15, creatinine 1.0, blood sugar 157.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to the hospital and given a bowel preparation with neomycin and erythromycin and made n.p.o.
On [**2120-4-16**] the patient was taken to the operating room where a distal esophagectomy and total gastrectomy was performed as well as a jejunostomy tube placement.
The patient was put on patient-controlled analgesia for pain control on postoperative day one after his epidural had fallen out.
He was started on postoperative day one on tube feeds, Impact with fiber at half-strength, 20 cc an hour.
The patient was doing well on his tube feeds and the Dilaudid PCA on postoperative day number two.
His tube feeds were slowly increased to 30 cc an hour.
Physical therapy was consulted to evaluate for ambulation and the patient was found to be doing well from this standpoint.
It was felt that after adequate pain control was obtained the patient would be able to be successfully able to ambulate throughout his hospital course and could ultimately go home when medically stable.
His tube feeds on postoperative day number three were increased again to 50 cc an hour.
The patient was maintained on nasal cannula oxygen throughout his hospital course after extubation.
Aggressive chest physical therapy and pulmonary toilet were instituted and the patient maintained a good O2 saturation on three liters of oxygen.
His tube feeds were slowly advanced to goal at half strength at 90 cc an hour and the patient was tolerating the tube feeds well.
It was decided that the patient could be increased to two-thirds strength tube feeds after arriving on the floor due to the fact that the patient was tolerating his tube feeds.
The patient was started on sips on postoperative day six which he was able to tolerate after an upper GI/small bowel follow-through was performed.
This showed an open anastomosis with no leak, therefore his nasogastric tube was removed using mineral oil to lubricate.
On postoperative day number eight his tube feeds were switched to two-thirds strength and the patient tolerated the switch well.
He was also started on a clear liquid diet which he was able to tolerate.
On postoperative day eight in the evening he was stared on a soft solid diet and he continued to improve.
On postoperative day number nine his tube feeds were cycled so that they would run from 7 PM to 7 AM, giving him two-thirds strength Impact with fiber at 90 cc an hour and he could be disconnected from his jejunostomy tube feeds during the day, allowing him to ambulate.
The patient continued to do well and continued receiving chest physical therapy, and was out of bed and ambulating.
Nutrition had seen him and had given him nutritional teaching about a soft solid diet and multiple small meals, and it was decided that the patient could be discharged home.
The patient was discharged home in stable condition with services in place, for planned jejunostomy tube feeds at 90 cc an hour of two-thirds strength Impact with fiber.
