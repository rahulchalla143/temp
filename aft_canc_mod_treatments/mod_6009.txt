He tolerated the procedure well and was feeling well until Sunday when he noted significant L flank pain.
Patient was given Morphine, hydromorphone, ondansetron and phytonadione as well as 2 U FFP to reverse INR.
IR was contact[**Name (NI) **] and did not feel that the bleeding was excessive, however was concerned for possible pseudoanuerysm based on CT findings and therefore recommended angiogram in AM for further characterization.
Surgery was also consulted and did not recommend surgical intervention at this time.
He was admitted to the ICU for monitoring given unstable vitals and crit drop.

Soft tissue nodule in this RF ablation site, left adrenal lesion, and left para-aortic lymphadenopathy are all unchanged.
No new pulmonary abnormalities can be identified on this portable chest examination.
This finding has decreased, but was not completely eliminated on the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of [**2155-4-7**].
[**4-9**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**4-8**], there has been placement of a right IJ catheter that extends to the mid-to-lower portion of the SVC.
The endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in place.
Brief Hospital Course: 84yo gentleman with RCC, s/p recent aortic lymph node biopsy who presents with flank pain, dropping HCT and evidence of RP bleed on CT. .
# Retroperitoneal bleed with subsequent hemorrhagic shock: Patient admitted with flank pain, 6 point drop in HCT, and intermittently unstable blood pressures, likely due to bleeding s/p recent procedure and elevated INR while on anticoagulation for afib.
General surgery and IR consulted, and initial plan was for close monitoring if patient remained hemodynamically stable with angiogram the following morning to better characterize the pseudoaneurysm.
However, HCT further dropped by 10 points, and given concern for ongoing bleed in setting of further decrease in HCT and worsening pain, patient went to angio for immediate procedure early the following morning.
Patient received additional 2 units FFP just prior to procedure.
Following the transfusion and stenting, HCT stabilized.
However, the patient developed increasing respiratory distress and hypotension, requiring initiation of pressors and intubation.
Prior to any additional procedures, family meeting held and decision was made to not continue aggressive measures.
Patient had R IJ HD catheter placed [**4-8**] in anticipation of possible HD, though he was not dialyzed after family meeting held [**4-9**] and decision was to focus on comfort measures only.
When EKG demonstrated peaked T waves and K 6.7, he received CaGluc, Insulin+Glucose, and additional kayexalate with subsequent decrease in K.  Plan had been for HD, though initiation of HD deferred as above given goals of care to focus on comfort.
His beta blocker and diltiazem were held in setting of hemodynamic instability, and anticoagulation held given bleed.
