Osteoarthritis 4. s/p bilateral catarect surgery  Social History: Lives with his step-son who is his only child and his HCP, his name is [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 36913**] and his cell phone number is: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 79899**].
Slower with left heel-to-shin compared to right.
However, if the pt and his HCP wish to allow him to eat against these recommendations given that the goals of care are now hospice related, I would suggest a diet of honey thick liquids and pureed solids, as these will result in the least amount of aspiration.
The EP team did not recommend a pacemaker due to his prognosis.
They also requested that he did not be given any beta blockers, given his heart block.
Palliative care was consulted who recommended longterm care placement for comfort care.
Due to pharmacy delays he did not receive his potassium repletion until the afternoon and this was too late for him to be transferred.

Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and Ibuprofen etc.
If you have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam), you will not require blood work monitoring.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Make sure to continue to use your incentive spirometer while at home.
