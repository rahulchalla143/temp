The pt was started on NS IV to gravity and given Lorazepam 0.5mg IVP and Benadryl 50mg IVP x1 with resolution of symptoms.

1L NS were infused.
Of note, the pt was recently admitted to BIDN [**1-9**] for pyelonephritis and enterococcus bacteremia - ultimately treated with ciprofloxacin for a 2wk course with subsequent nephrostomy tube change [**2199-1-15**].
He also experienced several episodes of afib with RVR requiring dilt gtt, and his home metoprolol tartrate was uptitrated to TID.
He had diarrhea with chemotherapy but it resolved one week ago.

Alternatively, it may represent foci of air within small veins from intravenous injections.
Correlate clinically for pharyngeal infection.
Bilateral displaced percutaneous nephrostomy tubes.
Bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes in place.
Brief Hospital Course: 68M with hx of metastatic prostate cancer c/b obstructive uropathy requiring bilat nephrostomy tubes, COPD, CAD s/p NSTEMI, severe pulm HTN, h/o dCHF with newly depressed EF who was sent to the ED after developing anxiety, tachycardia, and AMS in the setting of chemotherapy  # Afib with RVR (not anticoagulated): He is not anticoagulated because of a history of severe GI bleeding.
He was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from the ED because he was requiring a diltiazem gtt.
Upon arrival to the ICU, the dilt gtt was stopped and HR was better controlled with IV metoprolol.
His metoprolol was uptitrated and he was started on diltiazem 30mg PO qid with fair improvement in HR.
At this time, he was transferred to the cardiology service for further management of his Afib with RVR.
We discussed these risks with the patient, his daughter, his outpatient oncologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and his outpatient cardiologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5858**] and the decision was made to proceed with amiodarone loading.
He was started on PO amiodarone loading which he will continue after discharge, the dosing is outlined in his discharge paperwork.
He remained in NSR with HR in the 110-120s at discharge, which we are tolerating until he is loaded with amiodarone for rhythm and rate control.
He cannot tolerate the addition of a calcium channel blocker given his low EF and is on max dose of metoprolol.
We also considered docetaxel as a cause for his sepressed EF.
While not as cardiotoxic as the anthracyclines, there has been an association with systolic dysfunction, althogh the expected time course is unclear.
The day of discharge, he was restarted on Lasix 20mg PO daily.
At discharge, he will continue on lasix 20mg PO daily.
He was placed on neutropenic precautions.
Of note, the patient was admtited to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] in [**12/2198**] with Enterococcal sepsis and pyelonephritis which was treated with Cipro for 2 weeks.
He had bilateral nephrostomy tubes changed on [**2199-3-7**] by IR.
His left nephrostomy tube always drains more urine that the right at baseline.
Creatinine this admission was initially stable in the 1.9-2.2 range and his colchicine was held because GFR was less than 30.
On HD [**6-27**], his Cr started to rise after his bilateral nephrostomy tubes became displaced.
Repeat renal US after the procedure showed resolution of hydronephrosis and proper tube positioning, his Cr was trending down.
He has bilateral nephrostomy tubes in place [**12-20**] obstruction in [**2198-11-18**].
He was not requiring fentanyl patch this admission.
He was continued on aspirin and metoprolol.
# Gout: No active symptoms, colchicine held as described above.
#Code status this admission: FULL CODE (confirmed with patient)  #Transitional issues -Will have Chem-7 checked Thursday [**2199-3-15**] at rehab to monitor lytes and BUN/Cr, results faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] (PCP) -Tolerating HR up to the 130s if he is asymptomatic, he is in the process of being loaded with amiodarone for rhytm control -Urine output has been low since he is recovering from obstructive uropathy after his nephrostomy tubes were displaced, he has been making 200-500cc urine per day, left nephrostomy tube always makes more than right -Will need repeat TTE after HR well controlled to assess for recovery of systolic function -Patient was not requiring a fentanyl patch at discharge, pain was controlled with oxycodone, tylenol and Lidoderm patch.
-Colchicine stopped because of elevated Cr, can be restarted if eGFR >30 -Metoprolol tartate changed to metoprolol succinate 150mg PO daily -ACEi/[**Last Name (un) **] not started in the setting of elevated creatinine, this can be re-addressed as an outpatient -Will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding further management of his aggressive prostate CA -Bilateral nephrostomy tubes changed [**2199-3-7**]  Medications on Admission: colchicine [Colcrys] 0.6 mg Tablet once a day fentanyl 25 mcg/hour Patch 72 hr folic acid 1 mg Tablet PO daily furosemide 40 mg Tablet by mouth once a day metoprolol tartrate 50 mg Tablet three times daily Ondansetron HCl 2 mg/mL Solution as needed for mild nausea Ondansetron HCl 8 mg Tablet by mouth every 6 hours as needed as needed for for nausea oxycodone 5 mg Tablet by mouth every 3 hours as needed for breakthrough pain Pantoprazole [Protonix] 40 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **] Prochlorperazine maleate 10 mg Tablet PRN every 6 hours for nausea triamcinolone acetonide [Kenalog] 0.147 mg/gram Aerosol APPLY [**Hospital1 **] Acetaminophen 650 mg Tablet by mouth as needed for T >100.6 Aspirin 81 mg Tablet, PO daily Calcium carbonate 200 mg calcium (500 mg) Tablet, Chewable 1 Tablet(s) by mouth EVERY 8 HOURS PRN camphor-menthol Ointment 1 Lotion(s) four times a day as needed for itchy rash lidocaine Dosage uncertain magnesium oxide 400 mg Tablet by mouth TWICE A DAY Thiamine HCl 100 mg Tablet by mouth every day   Discharge Medications: 1. folic acid 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).

This was controlled with IV and oral medications.
We decided to start a medication called amiodarone which will help slow your heart rate as well as help keep you in a regular rhythm.
You nephrostomy tubes also became partially dislodged.
You had both of your nephrostomy tubes replaced on [**2199-3-7**].
Your creatinine (measure of kidney function) also mildly increased after this obstruction resolved and is now downtrending.
The following changes were made to your medications: START amiodarone at tapering doses as outlined below START metoprolol succinate 150mg by mouth daily START dronabinol 2.5mg twice daily STOP metoprolol tartate STOP fentanyl patch DECREASE lasix to 20mg by mouth daily  Followup Instructions: Department: Cardiology Name: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5858**] When: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 80465**] office is working on a follow up appointment for 4-8 days after your hospital discharge.
