[**2178-7-11**] MRI brain; IMPRESSION: Multiple evolving infarcts identified in the supra- and infratentorial regions with enhancement at the site of the infarcts.
Multiple foci of ischemia/infarction demonstrate evolution, with increase in size and more hypodense appearance.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 13834**] is a 68 yo F, of unclear handedness, hx of DM2, HTN, HLD, prior DVT, CRF, and metastatic endometrial CA, s/p recent onset of taxol/carboplatin chemo, received her second cycle of chemo [**7-2**] and since then has been acting "disoriented" per her son, who today was found on the ground in with more substantial MS changes and dysarthria.
It was thought she did not have any evidence of acute coronary syndrome and the troponin leak may have been due to imbalance of the autonomic nervous system with excessive sympathetic activity and catecholamine release secondary to her stroke vs. demand ischemia, and possibly also contributed from her renal failure.
She was transferred to the medicine service given her multiple comorbidities and followed by the stroke consult service.
For her likely embolic strokes, she was continued on lovenox and was deemed not to be an aspirin candidate due to her thrombocytopenia (platelet count in 30s-40s).
She was transferred to the neuro ICU, lovenox was discontinued, and she was transfused platelets, fresh frozen plasma, and started on keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
On [**7-17**], the patient was no longer breathing over the ventilator and her pupils were fixed and dilated.
Her MAP dropped to 40-50, and she was given IVF 250 cc boluses x2.
There was question of SVT vs. atrial fibrillation on telemetry and EKG, and she was started on diltiazem gtt for 1 hour.
She did not receive chest compressions.
She remained on ICU-level care until her son could come in the following morning.
