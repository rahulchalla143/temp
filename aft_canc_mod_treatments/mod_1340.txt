this is deep to the surgical staples, and may be post- operative, though clinical correlation woudl be required to exclude infection.
Ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are otherwise significant for symmetric, age-related prominence.
# Endocarditis: His endophthalmitis was felt to be secondary to endogenous source, and bacteremia was suspected.
Patient underwent TEE on [**12-16**] which showed a small vegetation on his aortic valve consistent with endocarditis.
He was empirically treated with vancomycin and ceftaz for bacterial coverage and ambisome and doxycycline for fungal and atypical coverage.
Numerous serologies including mycoplasma, brucella, bartonella, Q-fever and chlamydia were sent and which are negative to date.
Fungal workup included beta glucan and galactomannan serologies and fungal cultures were are negative.

There has been no positive culture data during this hospitalization, except for two universal PCR's done on [**12-14**] vitreous fluid and [**12-25**] groin pus - Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated both times.
He is currently on the floor and antibiotics were briefly narrowed to Daptomycin only on [**2106-1-26**] (Vancomycin was changed to Daptomycin over family's concern that Vancomycin may have been contributing to drug fever).
He continued to have fever to 101-102 on Daptomycin alone and upon the family's request on [**2106-1-28**], a three drug regimen to cover other nocosomial organisms (Aztreonam, Ciprofloxacin, and Metronidazole) was re-started.
On discharge pt is on Daptomycin IV untill [**2-18**], then keflex 500 [**Hospital1 **] for life, for supression therapy.
# Endophthalmitis:  He was evaluated by ophthamology in the ER and underwent urgent vitrectomy on [**12-14**] which produced pus.

A heme Onc consult was obtained, for further management and recommendations.
With regard to his MDS, he should receive PRBC and platelet transfusions as needed.

He did have a cardiac cath as outlined below.
Successful PTCA/stenting of proximal LCX with 3.0 X 15 mm VISION BMS  at 20 atms.
Successful placement of Vision bare metal stent in proximal LCX.
Other Cardiac: Elevated Troponins/Cardiac ischemia: Pt has significant hx of CAD with  coronary angioplasty and stenting [**2103**], CABG (LIMA to LAD, SVG to diagonal, SVG to OM, sequential.
He had ballon angio and had BMS placed on PTCA, Plavix was changed from Qday to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] x 1 week, then QD on ([**1-7**]), Cont ASA 325mg, Cont simvastatin.
# DM: His blood sugars were initially elevated but improved with sliding scale Humalog and evening Lantus.
Pt blood sugars stable on DC  # [**Month/Year (2) **] Brief: Incision and drainage of right groin abscess, radical debridement of right groin and sartorius muscle flap closure of groin wound [**12-25**] and Debridement and drainage of groin; removal of distal end of aortobifemoral graft and replacement with rifampin-soaked 8-mm interposition Dacron graft segment, complete removal of femoropopliteal graft, and oversewing of popliteal artery on [**1-7**].
Was on IV heperin.
Optho team concerned for endogenous source, especially given his immunocompromised status.
Concominant respiratory alkalosis with hypocarbia points away from narcotic-induced hypoventilation as etiology.
# Hyponatremia: Most likely secondary to hypovolemia given patient's history of very poor PO intake, dry MM, NS bolus 500cc x 1, Maintanaince fluids, Urine lytes.
Given IV fluids prior to IV contrast today Continue to monitor lytes and creatine, thougt to be contrast induced.
On Dc creatinine is stable  # Pain management: Stopped all narcotics this AM given that pt has AMS likely due to delusion- with hallucinations and inattention which per family seems worse after receiving pain meds, continue to close monitor MS and pain management, Cont on tylenol PRN, Lidocaine patch  # Altered Mental Status: Pt alert and oriented x person.
endocarditis and arterial graft infection, so ID recommended MRI of head for evaluation of septic emboli.
Ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are otherwise significant for symmetric, age-related prominence.
#Thrombocytopenia/Coags:  Pt was on hep drip which started on [**12-25**] and had decrease in platelets which have trended down over the last several days.
HIT was also in the differential, but less likely given the rate of plalet decline.
He has small hematoma at site of cath that is unchanged, Pt transfused multiple times, Pt put on IV protonix.
A clip was placed one cm.
One endoclip was successfully applied for the purpose of hemostasis.
Continue IV PPI gtt, chanfged to IV BID.
Hold heparin gtt, this was done.
pt on IV heperin for leg ischemia.
Pt was on tube feeds given poor po intake.
Will hold off in place tube back on since remains confused and was difficult to place.
Pt did have mutiple failed attempts at speech and swallow.
