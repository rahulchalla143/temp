Four new enhancing lesions, as described above, with marked "blooming" artifact consistent with blood products, melanin or both, with stability size and appearance of the dominant enhancing lesion and interval decrease in size of the adjacent "satellite" lesion.
Status post very recent right frontal craniotomy with resection of the dominant mass superficially located in the right frontal lobe; however, there is persistent band-like enhancement at the posterior and caudal margin of the resection cavity, highly suspicious for residual tumor.
Similar to minimally increased leftward shift of midline structures, now 9 mm.
Degree of early/slight right uncal herniation is unchanged from [**2179-4-23**].
He was taken to the operating room on [**2179-4-23**] for a R frontal craniotomy for lesion resection.
He remained on the mannitol and dexamethasone for the vasogenic edema.
They determined that he met criteria for a rehab facility.
