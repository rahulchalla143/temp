The patient's subdural drain had minimal output and was discontinued.
A family meeting was held at this time and it was determined not to pursue any further surgical interventions and therefore to not have any further head imaging as well.
It was determined to transfer the patient to the OMED Service with the expectation that the emphasis of care would be transition to comfort measures during the following day.
