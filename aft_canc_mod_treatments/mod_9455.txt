Regarding the patient's peripheral vascular disease, coumadin and aspirin were held in the setting of GI bleed.
Coumadin should be held indefinitely given his colon mass.
Would recommend starting aspirin 81mg daily in 2 weeks.
This can be discussed at his follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of vascular surgery on [**7-6**].
