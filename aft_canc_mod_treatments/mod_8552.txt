You were admitted to the hospital for nausea and vomiting, and were noted to have missed one of your dialysis sessions.
You underwent dialysis without complication, but developed high fevers.
You were found to have bacteria in the blood (bacteremia) and were placed on intravenous antibiotics.
You met with the neurology [**Hospital1 21334**], and will remain off blood thinners for at least 1 month.
You were on IV antibiotics which you will continue to receive at dialysis.
You also had a very slow heart rate at one point during your hospitalization you were monitored in the cardiac intensive care unit.
