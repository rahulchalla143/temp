There are multiple fat containing lesions/nodes throughout the mesentery and retroperitoneum.
Several other of the fat containing lesions appear to be surrounded by soft tissue density, and may represent lymph nodes with central areas of fat.
But consideration to other forms of infection, or secondary to the patient's recent BAL procedure is given.
Within these areas of atelectasis in the right lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**], is again identified a focal rounded hypo-intense areas consistent with either pulmonary infarcts or cavity formation.
[**12-23**] transfusion reaction DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Mr. [**Known lastname **] experienced an increase in respiratory rate, blood pressure, and heart rate 75 minutes following a test dose of IVIG.
Chills, chest discomfort may occur in the first hour of the infusion and respond to cessation of the infusion for 30 minutes and resumption at a slower rate.
Other side effects include dizziness, leg or muscle cramps, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath and wheezing.
For future infusions of IVIG, pre-medication with steroids and possible infusion at a slow rate are recommended.

A right hilar node measures 1.3 x 1.9 cm (previously 1.2 x 1.9 cm).
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care and work up of pulmonary nodules.
Here he was treated initially for HSV with Acyclovir.
He was started on Voriconazole, Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
Pt was transferred to MICU on [**2100-12-18**] with worsening respiratory status, never required intubation and was felt ready for transfer back to the floor on [**2100-12-22**].
GI was consulted and colonoscopy was performed with diagnosis of ileus and treatment with decompression with rectal tube.
Also during this period pt developed marked lower extremity edema thought secondary to increased IV fluid load on background of diastolic CHF.
Throughout the hospitalization pt was on heparin drip to treat the pulmonary emboli and was ultimately transitioned to coumadin.
Floor course and continuing management issues: 1.
Antibiotics were discontinued one by one.
Aztreonam was discontinued on [**1-3**].
Pt received a total antibiotic course of: vanco (20 days), Voriconazole (20 days), Aztreonam (18 days, d/c [**1-3**]), Cipro (12 days, d/c [**1-1**]), Flagyl (11 days, d/c [**12-31**]), Pt is to continue vancomycin (for corynebaterium in BAL gram stain) and voriconazole (for aspergillus) until he follows up in [**Hospital **] clinic.
COPD: Continue to treat COPD flare with albuterol, atrovent, Flovent, Spiriva, salmeterol.
Continue slow steroid taper.
Pt is to get Prednisone 30mg po qd for 3 days.
Continue on Prednisone 20mg qd daily.
Pt is being anticoagulated with heparin and coumadin (since [**1-1**]).
Continue heparin until pt is therapeutic on coumadin with goal INR [**3-9**].
Diastolic heart failure and LE edema - Pt became fluid overloaded after bronchoscopy with 3+ lower edema bilaterally.
Pt was given IV Lasix with goal negative 1 L per day.
Continue gradual diuresis with Lasix 80mg po qd.
Rectal tube placed for decompression, pt was made NPO w/ NGT for some time.
GI was also consulted, recommended conservative treatment.
Pt is improved overall clinically: passing stool through rectal tube and tolerating po diet.
Rectal tube fell out and was not replaced on [**1-3**].
On [**2024-12-31**], levels were found to be subtherapeutic; pt was given phenytoin boluses and maintenance dose was increased.
He was given additional bolus prior to discharge.
Pt should be continued on maintenance dose of Phenytoin 200mg tid.
Pt received another infusion thereafter, without incident.
Respiratory distress was most likely secondary to pt's other medication issues.
For future infusions of IVIG, pre-medication with steroids and possible infusion at a slow rate are recommended.
Pt was not restarted on acyclovir given improving rash.
If it worsens consider starting acyclovir for treatment of HSV.
He became hypernatremic on fluid restriction w/TPN.
