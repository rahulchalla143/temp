CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is an elective operation for low anterior resection, colostomy closure, incisional hernia repair x2 with component separation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 79-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, who three years ago underwent an emergency operation for a perforated diverticulitis resulting in an end colostomy and Hartmann's pouch.
She was interested in having her colostomy closed as well as having two incisional hernias repair, one at the site of her midline incision, and one at the site of her left lower quadrant around her colostomy.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room as planned on [**2122-11-2**] for colostomy closure, incisional hernia repair x2 with component separation.
The operation was without any complications.
On postoperative day 0, the patient had issues with low urine output and received multiple fluid boluses to maintain adequate urine output.
An epidural catheter was left in place, the patient had two JPs draining serosanguinous fluid, and she left the OR and PACU, and was transferred to the floor requiring O2 at 6 liters nasal cannula.
On postoperative day #1, urine culture was sent and later revealed Klebsiella that was pansensitive, for which she was started on levofloxacin.
Based on this blood gas and the patient's deteriorating respiratory status, she was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring, she was given 20 mg of IV Lasix for diuresis, and she was put on a nonrebreather and found to be sating improved at 96%.
An art line was placed in the ICU.
Later that day she was found once again to be tachypneic with desats to 85% on 100% nonrebreather as well as hypertensive to the 180s systolic.
A right internal jugular central venous line was placed.
The patient, on postoperative day three, was switched from Levaquin to Zosyn to cover her UTI and pneumonia.
She was rate controlled on Lopressor and diltiazem with adequate response.
On postoperative day #4, the results from the bronchial washings came back and the patient was started on fluconazole.
At this time, her epidural was D/C'd, and a nasogastric tube was inserted to start tube feeds.
However, she was tolerating tube feeds well.
A cardiac consultation was obtained on the basis of her ectopy and their assessment revealed that her rhythm was consistent with episodes of atrial fibrillation with superimposed rate dependent left bundle branch block, with no evidence of ventricular tachycardia.
They recommended to continue her beta blockade at a reduced dosage of 5 mg IV q.4h.
Cardiology did not recommend Coumadin at this time.
Patient was additionally transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 27.5 which improved to 30.8 status post transfusion.
