Admission Date:  [**2195-3-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2195-3-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2155-3-19**]             Sex:   F  Service: OTOLARYNGOLOGY  Allergies: Lanolin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4181**] Chief Complaint: Left Neck Mass  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**3-9**] Tracheostomy PICC line placement [**3-12**] PEG placement  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 39 yo female with no PMH, who initially presented to an outside ENT with left sided neck pain with minor swelling.
She was thought to have an abscess and was treated with a course of antibiotics.
After several courses of antibiotics an CT of her neck was done in mid-[**Month (only) **] showing a large mass/collection.
Past Medical History: None  Social History: non-contributory  Family History: Mother deceased from metastatic leiomyosarcoma of the lung  Physical Exam: 99.5   50   158  14  98% on AC 550 x 12, 40%, PEEP 5 Intubated and sedated JP right neck w/ serosang drainage.
Note is made of a prominent thyroid gland, with a nodule extending superiorly with internal calcifications.
An ET tube appears in appropriate position.
IMPRESSION: Large heterogeneously enhancing submandibular region mass which has undergone surgical biopsy with drain placement.
Note:  Nests of atypical epithelial cells are embedded in an inflamed, reactive fibrotic stroma.
There is a new tracheostomy tube in place, whose tip extends just into the trachea, and whose orientation is perpendicular to the tracheal wall at its tip.
There is a right subclavian catheter extending into the superior vena cava.
A nasogastric tube tip extends through the esophagus into the stomach.
The tracheostomy tube is very superficially located within the trachea, and its tip is perpendicular to the posterior tracheal wall.
Followup in three months recommended.
[**3-13**] US THYROID: unable to visualize thyroid secondary to mass, tracheostomy hardware and subcutaneous air.
She was on vancomycin and clindamycin at the OSH for concern of an abscess.
The infectious disease service was consulted and it was decided to broaden her coverage to vancomycin and zosyn.
She was maintained on a propofol drip and morphine iv for significant pain in her neck.
On HD#3 she underwent an FNA of the neck mass followed by a tracheostomy with the thoracic surgery team.
In addition a dobhoff NG feeding tube was placed during the procedure.
She tolerated the tracheostomy well and was weaned from the ventilator on POD#0.
She was extubated without difficulty on POD#1 and oxygenated well on a humidified trach mask for the remainder of her hospital stay.
She did have some difficulty clearing her secretions requiring mucomyst and frequent suctioning.
In discussion with the ID team, since the mass was no longer felt to be an abscess and the cultures from the outside hospital had no growth, her antibiotics were stopped on HD#5 and she remained afebrile for the remainder of her hospital course.
However, the thyroid gland could not be visualized secondary to the neck mass, the tracheostomy hardware, and subcutaneous emphysema from the recent procedure.
In order to maintain her nutritional status, a NGT was placed for tube feeds during the tracheostomy.
Once she reached goal tube feeds however she began having persistent nausea with a few episodes of emesis.
Because of the need for long term nutritional support and discomfort from the NGT, general surgery was consulted for PEG placement.
Tube feedings were restarted on [**3-13**].
She was tolerating goal tube feeds through the PEG tube with minimal residuals.
She was therefore transitioned to bolus tube feeds.
Once at goal tube feeds her BUN and sodium were noted to be slowly rising.
Her first tracheostomy change was done on [**3-7**].
A size 7 [**Last Name (un) **] adjustable cuffed tracheostomy tube was placed.
This should be changed to an noncuffed tracheostomy tube at the next trach change.
She was discharged to rehab on  [**2195-3-17**] for physical rehabilitation and teaching for trach and g-tube care.
Her PICC line was removed prior to discharge.
