Abdominal washout and reclosure with full-thickness skin flaps.
[**2138-5-24**] Exploratory laparotomy and small-bowel anastomosis.
[**2138-5-22**] Laparoscopy converted to exploratory laparotomy, extensive lysis of adhesions, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, small-bowel resection with primary reanastomosis x2, repair of serosal injury of bladder, cystoscopy.
The patient has been  having lower abdominal pain for 2 weeks now that fluctuates in intensity and is sharp and crampy and nonradiating.
She was started on levo/flagyl given concern for infection.
- Is not sexually active  OBH: G7P7-0-0-5 - SVD x7 - One child died at 1 year old and the other died of cervical cancer at age 52  PMH: - hx of UTIs - HTN - Hypercholesterolemia - Osteoarthritis - Anxiety  Health Maintenance: - [**Last Name (un) **]: has never had a mammogram.
She was noted to have diverticulosis and internal hemorrhoids.
She was therefore consented for a laparascopy, possible laparatomy and possible staging for large pelvic mass.
On [**5-22**], she underwent a laparascopy, which was converted to an open laparatomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, bowel resection x 2 with reanastomosis and repair of anterior bladder wall defect.
The case was complicated by large intra-operative blood loss requiring transfusion of 4 units of packed red cells and 750cc of albumin.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was tachy and febrile on [**5-24**] and had a repeat operation where she was found to have an open enterotomy with spillage of stool into the peritoneum.
She received 7L of fluid within 24h and had not made urine.
She was continued on vanco/Cefepime/flagyl, but was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **] SICU for further surgical mgmt, returned to the OR on [**5-25**] for a washout and noted to have extensive necrosis of the abdominal wall; this fascia was debrided.
The family at this point expressed their preference that she not be treated with further surgical intervention and that she be managed non-operatively.
Over the coming days, her fluid status was managed with lasix and albumin, she received blood transfusions, she spiked fevers and was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with antifungal coverage, and she received numerous blood transfusions for anemia and tachycardia.
Repeated family meetings were held and with the outcome consistent -- no surgical intervention but continue current management.
