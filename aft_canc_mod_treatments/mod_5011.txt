T cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma over 20 years ago, treated and cured with radiation and chemotherapy.
Radiation included mediastinum and chest.
Received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin/adriamycin (AP), and had definitive resection in [**2193-11-24**].
Operative specimen showed suboptimal necrosis (only 5% necrosis) and her postoperative chemotherapy was switched to AP alternating with IE (ifosfamide/etoposide).
Finished chemotherapy in [**2194-2-22**].
Her chemotherapy course was complicated by profound myelosuppression and mucositis/esophagitis.
Presents with worsening dyspnea (particularly on exertion), fatigue, and upper body/facial edema over the last several days.
She had a telephone discussion with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and she decided to pursue options including possible surgery in Buffalo [**Location (un) 63519**] Institute.
Due to extensive prior chemotherapy for her hematologic malignancy and osteosarcoma and previous serious myelosuppression with AP and IE, she was started on a 50% dose of gemcitabine and did NOT receive docetaxel for her 1st cycle.
She has received neulasta even with gemcitabine out of fear for myelosuppression.
Seen in clinic today and was admitted to the hospital for aggressive palliative treatment of her progressive symptoms.

ECHO done confirming left and right atrial compression, but only physiologic effusion.
Thoracic surgery consulted for surgical consideration, however, given extensive vascular invasion of mass, felt to not be a surgical candidate.
Not a candidate for XRT per Rad-Onc given already has received maximal doses.
Given the plan for IR SVC stent and possible Interventional Pulmonary stent, she was transferred to MICU West for plan to monitor for 24-48 hours.
[**6-20**] Bronchoscopy left airways patent.
Balloon dilatation of right main stem, and bronchus intermedius.
Covered stent placed in the bronchus intermedius, and Y stent placed (trachea-LMS-RMS).
Returned from Interventional Pulmonary intubated, sedated, hypotensive on neo.
Pt was seen by IR, stent was placed with femoral line and sheath in arm for access.
On [**2195-8-23**] started on Acapella therapy, maximum ventilation via shovel mask/O2 via NC; still with dyspnea and poor saturation.
Started on morphine IV for comfort/decreased dyspnea ---> changed to morphine gtt on [**2195-8-24**].
Added scopolamine for secretion management [**8-24**] and ativan prn for agitation.
One the afternoon of [**8-24**] the patient began to take agonal breaths and PEA was noted on the cardiac monitor.
Patient heart rhythm alternated tachy-brady until PEA.
3) Thrombocytopenia- Improved, still low.
Consider heavy heparin products and HIT especially in light of rapid drop.
No further lab draws as of [**8-24**] given comfort measures status.
4) PE-  subsegmental, diagnosed on Chest CT.  Not likely causing her symptomatology.
No further intervention given comfort measures status.
No further intervention/CXR given comfort measures status.
No further lab draws given comfort measures status.
No further lab draws given comfort measures status.
