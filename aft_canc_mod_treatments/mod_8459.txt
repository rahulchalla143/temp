Pt was transfused one unit [**Unit Number **] days prior to admission and he had recently stopped prednisone for coomb's positive hemolytic anemia.
At the time, the BAL cultures were negative and the patient was treated with abx and steroids.
The patient was subsequently started on heparin gtt.
Given CXR findings of increased perihilar haziness, and R infrahilar haziness, in conjunction with fever to 100.4 and a lactate of 3.5, he also received azithro 500mg x1, ceftriaxone 1g IV x1, and Lasix 20mg IV x 1.
He was then given NS 250 cc with some return of SBP to 110s.
The patient was not started on anticoagulation however given the concern for bleeding with several episodes of hemoptysis.
However the patient did improve clinically on vancomycin, levofloxacin and flagyl.
During his MICU course, the patient also received several blood transfusions for his Anemia and 5Q syndrome as well as multiple boluses of fluid to maintain blood pressure.
The patient did well for 24 hours post extubation and was transferred to the floor hemodynamically stable.

A chest tube was placed by thoracic surgery to decompress the pneumothorax.
A subsequent LE US demonstrated left popliteal DVT and the patient was started anticoagulation with a heparin gtt for presumed pulmonary embolus.
A CTA was eventually performed which confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary embolus..  Later during the course of his hospital stay, the patient developed hemoptysis and the heparin gtt was stopped.
In addition, the patient was started on antibiotics for his PNA (vancomycin/ceftriaxons/flagyl).
The patient clinically responded well to abx treatment and althoug had some difficulty with extubation secondary to persistent secretions, he was extubated on [**2123-3-9**].
The CXR was consistent with a blossoming PNA RLL (necrotizing component as per report).
A VATS was considered and CT surgery was consulted, they did not feel it was indicated considering his rapid improvement on antibiotics.
An IVC filter was placed by IR (the filter is a 3 month filter which can be removed at the time).
The patient was initially started on anticoagulation with heparin, howeve due to episodes of hemoptysis, the anticoagulation was stopped.
We recommend, re-starting anticoagulation with coumadin with target INR of [**3-11**] several weeks from discharge and removal of IVC filter in 3 months as it may become thrombogenic at that point.
As the pneumothorax was enlarging by CXR on [**2-23**], thoracic surgery was consulted and a chest tube was placed.
He was continued on nebulizers without an issue.
He was admitted on thalidomide for his MDS and decadron for his hemolytic anemia.
There he was started on rituximab (865 IV once a week for 4 weeks) as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The decadron was tapered down to 6mg once daily with intentions to decrease decadron even further.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will follow the patint while at [**Hospital3 **] for his rituximab dosing as well as his decadron taper (anticipate decreasing decadron to 4mg PO once daily on Thurs [**2123-3-18**]).
IVIG was considered for immune re-constitutions as well as for his MDS, however this will be started as an outpatient at Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 103826**] discretion.
While in the MICU, the patient was given numerous fluid boluses to maintain blood pressure and overall resulted in gross anasarca.
He was aggressively diuresed with lasix 40mg IV BID with goal to diurese 2L/day.
The patient was placed back on his outpatient regimen of lasix 80mg PO once daily in addition to aldactone 25mg PO TID.
The creatinie was stable during the active diuresis at 0.5 and BUN of 20s.
Recommend continued diuresis until euvolemic.
At the time, this was though to be due most likely to ICU myopathy vs. steroid myopathy as pt was intubated and sedated for 16 days while on chronic steroids.
Anticipate several months of intensive rehab necessary to regain his funcational status.
Patient was loaded on IV amio and placed on amio gtt.
Patient is now on amiodarone 200mg once daily with good control.
Lopressor was added for additional control in MICU.
After fluid boluses the ARF resolved with Creatinine back to baseline.
Creatinine was stable even after aggressive diuresis on the floor.
DM: Pt required insulin gtt while in unit due to decadron.
The FS remained within the normal range on his outpatient regimen for diabetes after titration of decadron.
