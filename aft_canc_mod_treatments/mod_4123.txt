She remained afebrile, and her pain was controlled initially with a morphine PCA, she was transitioned to a fentanyl patch with good control of her pain, but also with associated sedation, which was acceptable to the patient in discussion prior to initiation.
Her antibiotics were discontinued, as the patient desired to have comfort measures only.
Morphine and ativan were administered with good control of her pain.
However, the patient continued to have increasing discomfort, so morphine PCA was titrated to no pain with abdominal compressions.
A voiding trial was attempted, but after six hours, she was noted to have bladder distention and the foley was replaced for comfort.
The patient had failed palliative chemotherapy for metastatic cholangiocarcinoma.
