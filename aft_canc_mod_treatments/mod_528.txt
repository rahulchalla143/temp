Brief Hospital Course: 57 year old female with stage I ER/PR negative, Her2-neu positive breast cancer s/p initiation of docetaxel/carboplatin + trastuzumab regimen admitted with abdominal/flank/rectal pain; found to have severe septic shock requiring intubation and pressors with CT abdomen showing severe colonic thickening in the setting of neutropenia.
# Septic shock [**1-3**] neutropenic enterocolitis/typhlitis: Her abdominal/rectal pain may be secondary to the colitis seen in the distal colon (sigmoid and rectum) and this inflammatory/infectious process combined with her profound neutropenia may have lead to her sepsis.
Blood cultures ended up growing CLOSTRIDIUM SEPTICUM, which causes clostridial myonecrosis or a condition called "spontaneous gas gangrene", usually seen in those with risk factors of immunocompromise including colonic malignancy, neutropenia, or chemotherapy.
As we began to support her with mechanical ventilation and 3 pressors (norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and vasopression), her initial bladder pressure was 31, indicating a brewing intra-abdominal process.
Surgery was involved and believed that an ex-lap or any other intra-abdominal procedure would have been extremely risky and likely hasten her death.
She was aggressively resuscitated with IVF, diabetic ketoacidosis was treated with insulin gtt and aggressive IVF resuscitation with potassium repletion, and she was covered with antibiotics initially with vancomycin IV, cefepime, metronidazole, as well as PO and PR vancomycin for presumed severe C. diff infection.
Epinephrine was added as 4th pressor and extended GNR coverage was added, given the presumed GNRs report on the blood cultures.
She was also given stress-dose steroids with the recent history of dexamethasone with chemotherapy, but the blood pressure did not respond.
She was also given Neupogen to held with her WBC count, per Oncology team recs.
Bicarbonate and calcium were pushed to support her rapidly declining blood pressure.
Her condition did not improve and her family decided not to escalate any further care and eventually transitioned her to comfort care only.
