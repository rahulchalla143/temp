1) Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient was initially intubated for airway protection in the setting of apnea due to a likely neurological event.
Nevertheless, upon his arrival he required significant respiratory support with high FiO2's and pressures.
Given patient had a fever early in the day was initially treated for presumed pneumonia with cefepime/vancomycin and given bronchodilators for COPD.
He also required a signficant amount of IVF on the night of admission due to hypotension so then developed an exacerbation of his chronic systolic CHF.
He was diuresed successfully with doses of IV furosemide and extubated on [**2122-9-4**].
Following some respiratory distress on the night of [**9-4**] he was restarted on oral prednisone with plan for a five day burst.
Pt was breathing with minimal laboring, on exam had crackles and wheezing, crackles resolved after lasix challenge.
Respiratory came to assess pt for CPAP but pt refused this.
He completed 7-day course of vanco, will copmlete 7-day course of levofloxacin (last day [**9-11**]) and 5-day course of prednisone (last day [**9-9**]).
Nebulizer treatments, inhaled steroids, and inhaled albuterol should be continued at rehab.
He diuresed well with 60 mg doses of IV furosemide and was eventually negative for length of stay.
Pt was hypervolemic on exam with rales and lower ext edema, given lasix daily (from 80mg IV to 160mg PO) with net negative output of 1L/day.
Pt's exam prior to discharge was euvolemic and lasix was put back to home dose of 30mg [**Hospital1 **].
All other home medications were continued.
On the day of transfer, however, he had a fever and given no other likely source and abnormal chest radiograph he was started on cefepime/ vancomycin for possible health care associated pneumonia.
Given initially negative BAL results without gram positive organisms and then just with streptococcus pneumonia he was narrowed to simply levofloxacin on [**9-4**].
On [**9-5**], however, due to concern for a worsening appearance to his lower extremity and cellulitis his vancomycin was restarted and then cultures revealed MRSA growing on a BAL specimen from the lung as well as strep pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza.
He was continued on vancomycin and levofloxacin for total of 7-day course of each.
Lasix challenge was given and net output 1L obtained, but Cr continued to remain elevated.
Prior to discharge, returned to home dose lasix 30mg [**Hospital1 **], should have Cr rechecked at rehab.
Cr will likely begin to improve with continued gentle diuresis and adequate PO intake once fluid remobilizes intravascularly.
Eventually he was restarted on his home blood pressure regimen with lisinopril and metoprolol.
Nifedipine continued to be held.
