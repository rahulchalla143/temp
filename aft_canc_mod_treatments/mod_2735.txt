The epidural was removed on [**12-1**] and she was transitioned to PO pain medications, which she tolerated well.
CV:  Home cardiovascular medications were started postoperatively when patient was able to tolerate POs.
Resp:  Ms. [**Known lastname 56839**] was extubated on POD #1 and transitioned to face mask.
Overnight she required noninvasive CPAP to maintain O2 saturations > 90%.
She did not have a bowel movement for several days and was given colace, senna, and dulcolax in the SICU prior to transitioning to the floor.
GU:  A foley catheter remained in place until [**12-5**] due to her poor mobility and decreased urinary continence at baseline.

Vanc and levaquin were discontinued on [**12-9**] and [**12-11**], respectively.
Endo:  Regular insulin sliding scale was used for hyperglycemic control.
Her foley catheter was placed again per patient request, and after multiple advices from the medical team to discontinue it, as it could raise the possibilities of urinary tract infections, but due to her morbid obesity she felt more comphortable to keep it for a few more days on her postop period.
She felt her breathing was better after that and will continue to work on her incentive spirometer, and overall pulmonary toilet.
As per physical therapy's recommendations she will need a short term rehab to be able to get to her baseline activities, and will follow up as an outpatient with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
