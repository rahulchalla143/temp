Admission Date:  [**2172-8-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-9-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2114-3-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea, hoarseness, and cough  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy x2 Tracheal Y-stent placement [**2172-8-25**] Pigtail catheter placement (right) [**2172-8-25**] for pleural effusion Intubation [**2172-8-25**], re-intubated [**2172-8-26**] after attempted extubation Chest tube placement (right) [**2172-8-26**] for pneumothorax Radiation therapy x2 Chemotherapy x3days Lumbar puncture [**2172-9-3**]  History of Present Illness: 58 year-old female, 60 pack-year smoker, with dyspnea, hoarseness, and cough x1 month admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] SICU [**2172-8-25**] after found to have large mediastinal mass, today found to be poorly-differentiated carcinoma, suspected small cell.
Y-stent was placed that evening, in addition to Pigtail catheter for right-sided effusion.
Patient remained intubated following surgery, on paralytics due to low-lying ET tube and small volume bleeding after endobronchial biopsy.
Patient was reintubated within 10 minutes due to neurological unresponsiveness, hypoxia (O2 saturation 80s), and hemodynamic instability.
She was found to have a right pneumothorax, which improved with subsequent placement of chest tube.
Hospital course also complicated by hyponatremia on admission (Na 118) attributed to SIADH and improved with fluid restriction (Na 126).
Given hyperkalemia, hyponatremia adrenal insufficiency was suspected; evaluated by endocrine team who recommended stress dose steroids pending further evaluation of etiology of hypotension.
Also with non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, transient hypothermia (T 95 [**2172-8-26**]) of unknown etiology.
She remains intubated, on pressure support.

[**8-26**] Pleural fluid cytology: Rare groups of epithelioid cells, too few to characterize further.
By immunohistochemistry: mesothelial cells stain for calretinin and WT-1.
Right chest tube terminating at apex.
Interval tracheal stenting with improved caliber of airway.
Status post bilateral frontal craniotomy and probable aneurysm clipping with encephalomalacic changes in the right frontotemporal and left temporal lobes.
[**2172-9-4**] CT Chest w/o contrast (to evaluate tumor s/p XRT and chemo for future XRT sessions): 1.
Lymphangio-carcinomatosis in the right upper lobe.
Bronchoscopy [**2172-9-4**]: lots of necrotic tissue noted, ETT tube dislodged between stent and tracheal wall, repositioned during bronch.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course [**Date range (3) 84902**] 58F with likely small cell carcinoma complicated by SVC syndrome, airway compromise requiring Y-stent, pericardial effusion, resolved pleural effusion and pneumothorax, and electrolytes disturbances admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for radiation decompression therapy and chemotherapy.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she underwent XRT x2 and then chemotherapy for 3 days.
Pt was started on vancomycin, cefepime and ciprofloxacin (started [**2172-8-31**] for 8 day course) for VAP.
She initially withdrew from noxious stimuli but later was less responsive.
AMS continued despite sedation being off.
Differential also included seizure (given hx of cerebral aneurysm repair, on anti-epileptics presumably prophylactically) although EEG did not demonstrate focal abnormalities.
Pt underwent 3 days of chemotherapy and 2 sessions of XRT.
# Acute Renal failure: In setting of chemo with carboplatin.
Uric acid and electrolytes elevated 4-5d post chemotherapy concerning for tumor lysis syndrome.
Despite adjusting ETT placement and decreasing RR to reduce auto-peep, pt's acidosis worsened.
Unable to assess for PE by CTA as pt in renal failure and VQ would not be helpful in setting of other lung pathology.
Pt remained tachycardic to 130s despite numerous fluid boluses.
Low UNa does not exclude SIADH; renal recommended rechecking urine lytes with saline load, whcih was not done in setting of pt?????
Hyperkalemia originally attributed to hypoaldosteronism and Type IV RTA, but unlikely per endocrine because of low urine sodium.
Possible that tumor pushing into trachea shifted to compress SVC after stent placement.
She underwent radiation therapy and chemotherapy for decompression.
Pleural effusion:  s/p right pigtail catheter placement [**2172-8-25**], removed [**2172-8-31**].
Pneumothorax: Developed pneumothorax in setting of re-intubation that resolved after chest tube placement.
EKG without signs of electrical alternans but does have low voltages.
Metoprolol was held and glucagon given in case this was due to beta blocker toxicity, but pauses decreased in frequency and duration on their own without intervention.
[**Month (only) 116**] have been due to ETT tube displacement pressing on carotid when pt was turned.
Most likely due to chemotherapy and no improvement in counts on neupogen.
Her antiepileptic medications were continued.
