She diuresed quite well with lasix and was weaned down to 3L NC.
ROS is remarkable for right sided facial droop over the last week and left sided headache.
Also reports right arm numbness related to an IV placed several months ago.
Biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated tumor, ER/PR/Her2neu all negative, underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and subsequently bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction in [**7-29**], and subsequently with radiation post operatively.
She was started on xeloda and avastin, which were stopped when liver mets were seen on imaging.
At that time, she was started on adriamycin.
After that, her adriamycin was switched to navelbine.
Cushingoid Neck: JVP difficult to appreciate but appeasr flat Lungs: Decreased breath sounds diffusely on the R ([**1-24**] way up)and at left base with dullness to percussion in these areas CV: tachycardic, regular, no murmur or rub Abd: soft, nt/nd, +bs Ext: 2+ BLE edema with cracking of skin on feet bilaterall, mild erythema Neuro: Right peripheral facial droop with decreased forehead wrinkling.

If indicated, a cardiac MRI or CT may be better to assess for pericardial constriction/pericardial thickness.
CRX [**6-9**] Mild pulmonary edema has worsened, left lower lobe is chronically collapsed, no appreciable right pleural effusion, pigtail pleural drain still in place, small left pleural effusion stable, heart size is normal.
Since the chin is down, tip of the endotracheal tube less than 15 mm from the carina is acceptable.
Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
Brief Hospital Course: In short, Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 40F w metastatic breast cancer and malignant pleural effusions, admitted with shortness of breath, transferred to the ICU in the setting of seizure and PEA arrest.
IP evaluated her and performed a thoracentesis on [**2186-5-23**].
Her symptoms improved with this procedure as well as with diuresis prior to transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
She was continued on Lasix 40mg PO BID for component of heart failure as well given association with lower extremity edema.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she had IP place a pig tail chest catheter placed to drain her infusion.
She required intubation with her PEA arrest advent.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was repeatedly attempted to wean from the ventilator on a daily basis.
She was diagnosed with a HAP MSSA PNA and was treated with a course of vanco and Zosyn initially and then continued on Zosyn.
Despite aggressive and repeated treatment of pneumonia, pleural effusion, volume overload, daily wake-ups/SBTs the patient was unable to been weaned from the ventilator.
Thus, despite aggreessive and repeated attempts toward extubation, she remained intubated until expiration.
After she had been intubated for over 2 weeks and it was clear that this was not improving despite aggressive attempts toward extubation, the situation was discussed extensively with the husband.
We had proposed either tracheostomy and long-term care or pursuing palliative care (extubation, comfort care).
Thus, patient remained on mechanical ventilation for extended period of time.
# Metastatic breast cancer: Patient has widely metastatic breast cancer including brain, liver, and pleural fluid mets with poor prognosis.
She was continued on home Decadron 8mg daily as well as Keppra and dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
Palliative care was consulted and recommended starting Dilaudid for pain control which was done.
Then had agonal breaths requiring intubation (see above for resp course).
Her anti-seizure medications were increased, however, her dilantin level was very labile during her admission due to concern about PO absorption.
3 days prior to expiration she was changed to IV dilantin.
She had previously discussed this with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 79**] and plan was to obtain further imaging, however, it was decided that it would not change management since neurosurgeon would not consider her a surgical candidate.
Neurooncology was following and recommended palliative care.
Given that the patient had intracranial tumor, the differential including bleeding into that area, edema, expansion, early herniation - to determine this, we attempted to perform a head CT scan but the husband refused for the reason that he felt it would not change her management.
Whatever process had evolved likely then lead to complete neurologic catastrophe on the final day of the hospital course likely reflective of brain herniation given the neurologic examination revealing fixed, dilated pupils with no corneal reflexes and no response to any stimuli (verbal, painful).
She was given IVF bolus and Epi 0.2mg.
