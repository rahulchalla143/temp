Patient was noted to be in afib with RVR in the OR and was started on neo gtt.

[**2128-5-25**] Left femoral reamings 1.
[**2128-5-25**] Intraop Films 28 spot fluoroscopic images were obtained intraoperatively without the presence of a radiologist.
FCorrelaiton with real-time findings and,when appropriate, conventional radiographs is recommended for full assessment.
The right hip and proximal femoral neck are not well evaluated on this scan.
However, if this corresponds to the site of symptoms, then conventional AP and lateral views of the right lower extremity or alternatively an MRI scan would be recommended for further assessment.
Her post-operative course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR and hypotension.
# DVT: Patient was found on LENI to have left posterior tibial vein deep vein thrombosis.
Patient was started on Lovenox (therapeutic dosing) and given her hemoptysis, closely monitored.
- Continue Lovenox 110mcg q12 daily .
Pulmonary was consulted who felt this was likely related to known pulmonary metastatic disease in the presence of lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.
Patient did benefit from 2L nasal cannula at night, more for OSA.
Ultimately, patient's lovenox had to be increased to therapeutic doses given her left lower extremity DVT.
- Continue 2L nasal cannula at night, room air during the day - Continue Lovenox at DVT treatment dosing .
She was started on enoxaparin post-operatively.
She should get extra pain medications as needed prior/during work with physical therapy.
She was started on nortriptyline and increased morphine.
Nortriptyline was eventually stopped given some concerns for tremor and weakness in her upper extremities.
Patient was started on gabapentin, MS Contin (titrated up to 90mg TID) and lidocaine patches with control of her pain.
- Continue Morphine Sulfate IR 15-30mg every 4 hours for breakthrough pain - Continue MS Contin 90mg TID for ongoing pain (can decrease to 90/60/90mg if overly sedated) - Continue gabapentin and lidocaine patches - the latter has been particularly helpful in controlling patient's pain .
Atrial fibrillation: Her post-operative course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR and hypotension.
She was loaded with digoxin and converted into a regular rate.
She was placed on metoprolol TID.
- Continue current metoprolol TID dose .
- Continue lorazepam PRN for anxiety and before bed to help with sleep .
Patient does also have a number of metastasis to her skin (left flank purplish nodules), confirmed by biopsy pathology reports.
- Continue 2L nasal cannula when sleeping - Continue incentive spirometry, mobilization, and avoid increasing sedating meds.
