Brief Hospital Course: 83 yo male w/hx of CAD s/p recent PTCA, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD s/p CEA and AAA repair, prostate CA s/p radiation tx, afib- off coumadin admitted [**3-9**] for falling hematocrit and melena.
Patient underwent colonoscopy, and multiple polys were removed without complication.
Patient underwent surgical evaluation with concern for cholecystitis vs. bowel microperforation.
Therefore, patient was administered metoprolol 5mg IV X 2, then diltiazem 10mg IV with good effect, and patient's rate came to 110s.
At that point, it was felt that adequate evaluation of patient's volume status in the form of central venous pressure was necessary, and central line placement was offered to patient.
However, at this point, patient began to refuse all medical interventions including foley catheter placement.
Coronary artery disease: Patient had recently undergone catheterization with placement of multiple bare metal stents and was initially started on Plavix, however, this was later held due to continued symptomatic GI bleeds.
Of note, aggressive managment of patient's episode of AFIB/RVR was undertaken despite no hemodynamic compromise given concerns of demand ischemia.
ARF/diarrhea likely secondary to dehydration from bowel prep for colonoscopy and over-diuresis with lasix.
Of note, patient did have at urinary tract infection concerning for urosepsis, however, following IV hydration, gap acidosis corrected.
Despite transfer to the intensive care unit, patient became adamant in his refusal of further interventions, and ultimately decided that he wished comfort management only.
This was an appropriate decision as further interventions required for his care would have been fairly aggressive in the setting of poor cardiovascular and hemodynamic status.
