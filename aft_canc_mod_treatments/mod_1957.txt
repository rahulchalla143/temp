Patient is s/p recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] from [**Date range (1) 27344**] where he was treated for alcoholic hepatitis and alcohol withdrawal.
Given an elevated Madrey score he was started on prednisolone 20mg twice daily with a plan for four week course with 2 week taper.
He was intubated via RSI w/ etomidate and succinylcholine with a 7.5 ETT.
In the ED, there was concern for meningitis/encephelitis given fevers & altered MS w/ relative HD stability so he received broad spectrum coverage with zosyn 4.5 g IV, vancomycin 1 g, CTX 2g, acetaminophen 1g PR.
He was started on propofol after intubation.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is intubated and sedated and unresponsive to verbal stimuli and sternal rub.

There is a dilated recanalized umbilical vein, a portion of which has herniated through a small umbilical hernia (2; 60).
RUQ ultrasound: Color Doppler and spectral waveform analysis was  performed.
Polyp biopsy: Antral mucosa with hyperplasia of gastric pits, mucin depletion, and focal acute inflammation consistent with foveolar hyperplastic polyp; no histologic evidence of H. pylori seen.

Toxic Metabolic Encephalopathy:  The initial differential included hepatic encephalopathy, infection, meningitis, and toxin ingestion.
In the ED, he was started on empiric treatment for meningitis with vancomycin/ctx/acyclovir.
His regimen was initially tapered to acyclovir to cover HSV encephalitis and ceftriaxone to cover SBP.
His mental status improved dramatically on lactulose and rifaximin alone and there was evidence in records from the [**Hospital1 1501**] that he was receiving lactulose only once daily.
He was transferred from the MICU to the floor, where his mental status continued to improve off all antimicrobials and with lactulose/rifaximin.
# Respiratory failure: He was intubated in the setting of altered mental status in the emergency room.
He was quickly extubated in the MICU without difficulty after lactulose loading, and was subsequently transferred to the floor.
He also had an EGD performed which revealed 2 cords of Grade I varices.
Prednisone was stopped (had been started at OSH for alcoholic hepatitis, however discriminant function on that admission was not elevated to the point where this hospital would typically start steroid therapy).
Lactulose and rifaximin were continued - this will be very important to take at the extended care facility to prevent confusion and a repeat of the events that led to this admission.
Continued vitamin supplementation as above.
He was placed on standing 40mg daily potassium and magnesium oxide supplementation, with plans to check labs at least QOD for the first several days after discharge to make sure patient's electrolytes stay in a safe and acceptable range.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Likely pre-renal in setting of hypovolemia from marked stool output and decreased PO, improved with gentle IVF to baseline Cr 0.6-0.8. .
# Depression: Patient reports he has not been taking sertraline, which had been listed on a medication list, so this medication was not given.
# Antral polyps:  Two sessile non-bleeding polyps of benign appearance were found in the antrum of the stomach, biopsies were taken and showed antral mucosa with hyperplasia of gastric pits, mucin depletion, and focal acute inflammation consistent with foveolar hyperplastic polyp; no histologic evidence of H. pylori seen.
# Seborrheic Dermatitis:  Patient had mild seb derm on admission, which improved with Ketoconazole cream .
