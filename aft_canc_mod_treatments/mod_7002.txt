She underwent occipital craniotomy for resection of her lesion and was transported to the ICU intubated following her procedure.
On [**5-7**] she was deemed fit for transfer to the stepdown unit for further management The external ventricular Drain was rasied to 20 H2Ocm above the tragus.
The foley catheter was discontinued.
Then, she continued to have difficulty with urinary retention and required several voiding trials which required straight cath on [**5-8**] and [**5-9**].
On [**5-9**] into [**5-11**] she was agitated, was refusing medications and expressed paranoid thoughts.
This behavior was attributed to steroid psychosis as she had been on high dose steroids since her procedure and so her steroid dose was cut in half with a rapid taper to off over 2 days.
Her symptoms were managed with PRN Seroquel and haldol with limited effect.
Her Coumadin was restarted at 5mg on [**5-10**] without load or heparin bridge due to risk of intracranial bleeding.
