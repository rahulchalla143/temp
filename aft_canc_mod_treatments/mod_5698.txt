Pt had CXR c/w pulmonary edema, BNP 83K, treated with diuresis BIPAP with some improvement.
Started on heparin qtt, nitro qtt, given [**First Name3 (LF) **].
Arrived to [**Hospital1 18**], found to have AFib with RVR at 150 bpm, started on amiodarone, cardioverted to NSR, had cardiac catheterization showing LCx with large ramus 80% lesion, tx with BMS x2.
She attributes the beginning of her breathing problems to the weight gain she experienced after starting on hydrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency leading to 15 lb weight gain.
Renal cell CA s/p right nephrectomy [**2104**] 2.
2nd primary renal cell CA L kidney: clear cell path, treated  w/ IFN x 12 weeks ([**4-13**] - [**7-13**]), s/p sorafenib ([**8-13**] - [**9-13**]) d/c'd [**2-10**] rash; 6mm met in RML 3.
Family History: NC, no hx of cardiac disease, no hx of cancers  Physical Exam: VS T , BP 123/77, HR 96 (NSR), RR 22, O2 sat 97% RA on NRB Gen: elderly, frail appearing woman, lying in bed flat, conversant in full sentences without getting short of breath, NAD HEENT: anicteric, OP clear, MMM Neck: JVP 9-10cm CV: reg s1/s2, II/VI systolic murmur at LLSB Pulm: CTA b/l, bibasilar crackles Abd: +BS, soft, NT, ND Ext: warm, 2 distal pulses b/l, no pedal edema, R groin with a-line, no hematoma, non-tender.
Pulmonary artery catheter is directed into left main pulmonary artery.
4  The proximal lesion in the ramus intermedius was predilated with a 2.5 X 15mm Voyager balloon, stented with overlapping 2.5 X 12mm and 2.5 X 08mm Minivision (Bare metal) stents with lesion reduction from 80% to 0%.
She was started on IV amiodarone and constinued to be tachycardic.
She developed AF again atthe completion of the procedure with rates of 120-140bpm.
Successful stenting of the ramus intermedius lesion with bare metal stents .
An ascending Swan-Ganz catheter tip projects over the left descending pulmonary artery.
F hx renal CA s/p nephrectomy, chemo presented with 1 wk of CHF sx's, found to have new cardiomyopathy, combination of ischemic and non-ischemic.
# Cardiac - Cardiomyopathy/systolic CHF - at presentation to outside hospital, pt was reportedly found to have both mitral and tricuspid severe regurgitation, , severely depressed LVEF and anteroseptal and inferoseptal hypokinesis.
Her cardiac enzymes had increased slightly, and her cardiac cath revelaed only a ramus lesion, which was stented with 2 bare metal stents.
Work-up for other non-ischemic causes of her cardiomyopathy reveal a normal TSH, iron labs showed Fe 326, TIBC 113, and although she had required some transfusions as outpatient since chemotherapy, this was not thought to be sufficient to cause iron overload or hemochormatosis type CM.
However, multiple routine EKGs on outpatient basis did not reveal resting tachycardia.
The patient was treated with agressive diuresis using Swan-Ganz line for hemodynamic monitoring.
She was started on metoprolol, which was titrated up as tolerated by her HR, and also started on ACE-I, titrated as tolerated by BP.
The patient's toprol dose was decreased [**2-10**] mood depression, and on 50mg of Toprol XL at time of discharge.
Her ACE-I was held in light of increased Cr to 1.4, although improving at time of discharge.
# CAD - ramus lesion stented, started on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need plavix for 1 month.
Started on lipitor 80mg initially in setting of MI, but outpt labs on [**1-14**] revealed normal lipids with LDL of 43, decreased lipitor to 10mg.
She was started on BB, ACE-I as above, ACE-I currently on hold.
# Rhythm - initially found to have AFib in the setting of decompensated CHF, started on metoprolol which was insufficient to rate control, and amiodarone was added.
She was initially started on heparin for anticoagulation after discussion of anticoagulation risks with her oncologist, who did not find any contraindications to this.
# UTI - she was complaining of dysuria, U/A was sent and found to have >200 WBC, + bacteria, started on bactrim on [**4-14**], her Cr jumped slightly and Bactrim was switched to cipro starting on [**4-18**] for a 5 day course.
# Renal carcinoma - in the past pt has been on experimental chemotherapy, however was intolerant to side effects.
Given malignancy, the thought of pulmonary embolus to exlain her shortness of breath was entertained, however given her improvement with diuresis thought less likely.
In addition, given her single kidney, and worsened renal function while inpatient, in addition to her having a solitary kidney, and her already being anticoagulated, CTA was not performed.
Consider remeron 7.5 mg depending on whether her mood depression persists.
