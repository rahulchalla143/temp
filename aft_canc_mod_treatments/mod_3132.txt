Her nocturnal BiPAP settings were changed from [**10-17**] to 13/5, however, the patient did not do well on these new settings and developed abdominal distension that made her dyspnea worse.
In the last few weeks she completed two courses of Levaquin and Prednisone for COPD exacerbation.
She completed last course of prednisone taper last Firday, 4 days prior to this admission.
Prior to her current admission, she has had increased confusion and was noted to be more lethargic and somnolent at home.

Cytology ([**2131-11-22**]): BAL washings positive for squamous cell carcinoma.
At baseline, she has severe COPD with an FEV1 of 0.4L, and was on nocturnal bipap with settings of [**12-17**] prior to admission without resolution of symptoms, and with ABG of 7.29/96/101/48.
On admission to the MICU, she was placed on bipap and started on a methylprednisolone taper and continued on albuterol and ipratropium.
At approximately 1am that night, she suffered respiratory arrest, and was emergently intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with fentanyl and versed sedation.
Subsequently, she was maintained on mechanical ventilation with continuous sedation via fentanyl and versed.
She was evaluated daily for possibility of extubation, but the combination of her anxiety and agitation on lowering of sedation and low tidal volumes with low pressure support led to the conclusion that she was not a candidate for extubation.
On [**11-22**], she went to the OR and a tracheostomy, left lingular BAL, EGD, and open G tube were performed.
Notably she had concretized tube feeds in her esophagus, and follow up formal EGD and biopsy were recommended.
The procedure was otherwise uncomplicated.
A 14 day course of vancomycin was completed, and the patient was placed on a 14 day course of linezolid.
On [**11-29**], the patient pulled out her tracheostomy tube; after briefly being intubated, the tracheostomy tube was re-placed that morning, and trach mask trials were re-initiated.
During the intubation on the night of arrival, she became hypotensive with SBPs in the 80s and was given IVF boluses and started on phenylephrine and norepinephrine drips.
Following placement of a central line, she was given fluid boluses to maintain CVP 12-14.
She was again placed on pressors -- a neosynephrin drip -- on her re-intubation; this pressor requirement quickly resolved.
On [**2056-11-8**], she spiked fevers to 103.5, developed thickened and copious secretions and failed to wean from vent, and was started on vancomycin and zosyn for presumed vent associated pneumonia.
Central line and A-line were replaced.
Central line culture grew MRSA, as did blood cultures and sputum cultures.
Zosyn was d/c'd and a five day course of gentamicin was added for synergy with vancomycin.
Pt had been treated prior to admission with levaquin for two courses of management of COPD flairs.
She was given a five day course of azithromycin for empiric treatment of CAP.
Sputum cultures on [**2131-11-22**] grew MRSA, and she was treated with vancomycin, which she was on for MRSA bacteremia, and then linezolid (14 day course, initiated [**11-26**]).
While intubated, patient was kept on versed and fentanyl drips.
After attempting pharmacological intervention with ativan, haldol, ambien, and zyprexa, her regimens were simplified.
She was weaned entirely off fentanyl and versed, and maintained only on prn ativan and zyprexa.
She continued to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, requiring restraints at night when in bed.
Post-intubation, nutrition was provided by tube feeds of Probalance at 55cc/hr.
She had an open g-tube placement at the time of tracheostomy, and the g-tube was subsequently used for feeding.
This was deemed by surgery not concerning for abscess, and the tube remained in use.
As an outpatient, she had been described as borderline diabetic, with elevated 2 hr glucose of 197 and hgba1c of 6.2.
In addition, she was on steroids while admitted, and consequently her elevated blood glucose levels were managed with insulin drip and then insulin sliding scale with standing NPH.
Cytology of bronchoalveolar lavage done at the time of tracheostomy was positive for squamous cell carcinoma.
