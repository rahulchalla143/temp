At the time of transfer from the MICU, the pt had elected to pursue palliative XRT for tumor control and possible symptomatic benefit.
He received dilaudid, morphine, tizanidine, and olanzapine to help with his symptoms.
A fentanyl patch was also titrated.
The patient received a total of 6 treatments with radiation therapy and decided not to complete all 10 treatments due to severe pain related to movement for these treatments.
His final pain regimen consisted of neurontin, tylenol, fentanyl patch, and morphine as needed.
The pt was treated with an 8 [**Known lastname **] course of vancomycin and ceftazidime and was gently diuresed.

## Anemia of chronic disease: The patient was transfused 2 units of PRBC prior to discharge for hematocrit of 22, along with IV Lasix.

Because the patient would be unable to  transport from home to XRT due to his severe pain, it was decided to pursue XRT in house.
