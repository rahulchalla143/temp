MICROBIOLOGY: Strongyloides Antibody, IgG ([**Doctor First Name **])   Strongyloides IgG           <1.00  ASPERGILLUS ANTIGEN           0.2  Fungitell (tm) Assay for (1,3)-B-D-Glucans : <31 (Reference Negative       Less than 60 pg/mL)  COMPLEMENT, TOTAL (CH50)      34                  31-60 U/mL  PATHOLOGY: Skin Biospy: Perivascular and dermal mixed inflammatory infiltrate with focal pigment incontinence, consistent with a medication reaction, see note.
Note: The sections show perivascular and dermal lympho-histiocytic infiltrate with numerous neutrophils and eosinophils.
There is also pink and red discoloration on the skin surface.
CVL was placed in R IJ; blood pressures resolved to 90s with fluid resuscitation and remained stable afterwards.
Pruritus responded well to prednisone and hydroxyzine; PO prednisone was changed to IV steroids for most of the hospitalization of of concern for poor absorption.
ANC recovered with neupogen and patient was continued on vancomycin for skin flora coverage.
Neupogen was stopped after ANC recovered.
WBC did continue to trend upwards to 70s in setting of steroids and previous neupogen but again trended down prior to discharge.
After the patient was transferred out of the ICU, he remained stable and was given a second course of chemo; on [**2181-4-26**] he received AVD (Bleomycin was held given above reaction.)
On discharge, he was kept on 40mg daily Prednisone with no plans to taper given continued active disease.
Ranitidine was added given steroids.
PENDING: Of note, if patient remains on long term steroids for this reaction he will require PCP prophylaxis, Calcium, Vitamin D as well as close followup with a PCP.

We think that this was a reaction to Bleomycin which was one of your chemotherapy medications.
While you were here, we gave you the second cycle of your chemotherapy, but did not give you the Bleomycin component.
We made the following changes to your medications: STOP taking Allopurinol Start taking Famotidine Please continue to take Prednisone 40 mg daily for now.
You can use Sarna lotion and Mupirocin lotion for your legs for itching or irritation.
You can take Benadryl or Claritin over the counter if you need for itching at home.
