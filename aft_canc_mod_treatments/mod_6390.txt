MICRO: Blood cx [**6-3**]: NGTD Urine cx [**6-3**]: >100K lactobacillus Legionella Ag [**6-4**]: negative Sputum: viral neg  Bone Marrow Biopsy pending  Brief Hospital Course: 40 yo female with metastatic NSCLC on dexamethasone for brain mets, and recent admission for PE returned with febrile neutropenia.
# Febrile neutropenia:  She was admitted to the MICU due to a borderline BP initially, which improved with fluids.
She was given stress dose steroids x24hrs before returning back to her normal deacron dose.
She was was broadly covered with cefepime and vanco while she remained neutropenic.
Once her counts rose with an ANC > 500 these were stopped and she was started on cefpodoxime to complete a 7-day course.
Differential for her neutropenia included marrow suppression/infiltration from her disease vs medication effect vs infection affecting her bone marrow.
Patient's bactrim was stopped on [**5-18**] and her counts were found to be depressed on the next lab check she had after starting the bactrim.
During her hospitalization  her keppra was stopped and she was started on topamax instead as keppra was also suspected of causing marrow suppression.
Bactrim was added as an allergy to OMR and she was instructed not to take bactrim again.
Iron studies showed anemia of chronic disease and vitamin B12 and folate have recently been normal.
# Metastatic NSCLC with brain mets: Patient has known brain mets s/p XRT which have resulted in seizures.
She was continued on gabapentin 300 mg PO Q8H.
As above her keppra was stopped and she was started on Topiramate 100 mg PO BID for seizure prevention.
She is on dexamethasone to decrease cerebral edema.
After the day of stress dose steroids as above she was continued on the dexamethasone taper as outlined by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**]: On [**6-12**] will decrease to 0.5 mg every other morning and on [**2161-6-27**] with stop.
