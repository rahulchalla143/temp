She had increased oxygen requirement, and needed to be intubated for respiratory distress, and transferred to the Medical ICU where she had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3928**] course on and off pressors for a very long time on the ventilator.
She was treated with 1-1/2 weeks of radiation therapy without significant improvement as a last ditch effort to try to improve her respiratory status.
At that time, the patient wished to proceed with treatment, and after 5 weeks in the hospital, she underwent a left pneumonectomy and omental flap on [**2182-4-23**].
A tracheostomy was performed on [**5-14**] to assist with her pulmonary toilet, and her chest tube was placed around the same time to try to drain this large pleural effusion around the only remaining lung.
She is currently on the floor with a Passy-Muir valve, on tube feeds at goal, starting with POs with strict aspiration precautions, and going to the rehabilitation facility.
This was at a time where her Lasix dose was cut back and was probably attributed to both mucous plugging, the development of a UTI, and the lack of ongoing diuresis.
She was also treated with antibiotics for gram-negative rod coverage, and eventually this was tailored to the Enterococcus that grew in her urine which was sensitive to ampicillin.
However, she had a penicillin allergy, so we treated her with vancomycin.
The chest tube was removed prior to this episode because the output from her right chest went from more than a liter to less than 200 per a 24-hour period over the course of about 10 days to 14 days.
Since her transfer to and return from the ICU, she has been overall improved, now tolerating Passy-Muir valve, and much more awake, alert and out-of-bed with activity.

She is going to rehabilitation and will  need respiratory therapy, pulmonary toilet, trach education, frequent suctioning, frequent nebs, negative fluid balance, antibiotics for a short time, physical therapy, occupational therapy, nursing care to check wounds, cardiorespiratory checks, evaluation for home services with social work given her prolonged hospitalization and her elderly husband, speech therapy, [**Name (NI) 36422**] valve ongoing, as well as strict aspiration precautions, given that she has one lung, has suffered a tremendous amount of respiratory compromise over the past few months, and would find an aspiration event absolutely devastating and probably life-threatening.
