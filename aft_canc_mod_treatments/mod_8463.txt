Colon and Rectum: Resection Synopsis  MACROSCOPIC  Specimen Type:  Colonic resection.
The second positive lymph node is the apex mesenteric lymph node designated with a suture by the surgeon.
The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal red cut surfaces without any evidence of masses or nodules.
It consists of a sheet of fibroadipose tissue measuring 20.1 x 8.3 x 2.1 cm.
He was taken to the operating room on [**12-7**] for left colectomy and splenectomy.
Postoperatively he did fairly well until [**12-16**] when he began to show signs of an anastomotic leak (abdominal distention, pain, decreased UOP).
He was taken back to the operating room where an ex-lap with G-J tube placement, appendectomy, and diverting ileostomy was performed.
Post-operatively, the patient required large amounts of volume to support his hemodynamics.
A L SCL was placed and a swan floated.
A chest tube was also placed for a small pneumothorax.
He was also started on pressors.
Three days later he began to improve, diuresis was begun, and pressors were weaned.
He tolerated his tube feeds, chest tube d/c'd on [**12-23**], and he was successfully extubated on [**12-24**].
Diuresis was continued, he began to tolerate oral intake, and calorie counts were started.
