On [**11-1**], she [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] partial proximal gastrectomy and pylorplasty with J-tube placment.
The follwing day she had another episode of hematemasis, was transfered to the ICU and electively intubated for airway protection.
Tear was controlled with thombin-soaked Gel foam, bleeding stopped.
She was transfused multiple units during these few days, HCT around 26.
She was on Zosyn and fluconazol 200mg IV daily.
She was transfered to [**Hospital1 3278**] SICU for treatment on the pseudoaneurysm.
She was taken to IR for stenting of of splenic artery aneursym.
She was weaned off the ventilator.
However, she was noted to be on 3L NC during ambulance transport.
Lasix was given.
On [**11-22**], she was switched from Zosyn to Cefepime.
Here she [**Hospital1 1834**] ERCP with placement of esophagastric metal 9cm x10mm stent proximal clipping.
She stent placement was verified by a pediatric scope.
She had been electively intubated prior to the procedure and was extubated post ERCP.
She was given lasix 20mg IV in the PACU.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was aggressively diuresed with furosemide because of flash pulmonary edema.
Past Medical History: Gastric CA s/p resection Breast ca s/p mastectomy Partial thyroidectomy for thyroid CA Bladder CA s/p transurethral resection HTN Splenic artery aneurysm s/p stenting  Social History: Married and lives with her husband, children live nearby, she is a former smoker of less than one pack per day, she drinks wine occasionally.
Family History: Breast ca, sister with gastric CA, a sister with lung CA, CAD and COPD in various family members  Physical Exam: Exam upon presentation on Medicine Floor: Vitals: T 98.6  HR 85 BP 160/88 RR 22 SaO2: 97 on 2L NC General: NAD HEENT: EOMI, anicteric sclerae, MMM, oropharynx clear, neck supple Pulmonary: CTAB Cardiac: RRR, normal s1 and s2, no murmurs Abdomen: soft, nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds present Extremities: No edema.
[**2113-12-7**] JP Drain Fluid       4+   (>10 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES.
J-tube in place  Bilateral LENI's [**11-20**]: No DVT above the knees  Abdominal Flouroscopy [**2113-11-24**]: A metal stent is visualized projecting over the GEJ, extending from the T9 vertebral body to the L1 vertebral body.
CXR (Portable AP) [**2113-11-25**]: The esophageal stent, right-sided IJ venous catheter and endotracheal tube are unchanged since stable in position.
A 10.5cm by 23mm Wallflex fully covered metal stent was placed successfully across the defect.
An endoclip was successfully deployed to clip the proximal end of the stent to the esophageal wall to maintain stent position.
ref 1673 Lot [**Numeric Identifier 83544**] (stent placement) Post surgical gastric anatomy was noted.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 83545**] is a 74 year-old lady with recently diagnosed gastric adenocarcinoma, s/p [**2-14**] gastric resection who was transfered from [**Hospital3 **] for esophageal stenting, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after intubation for respiratory distress from pulmonary edema, with a hospital course complicated by pulseless VTach/Vfib arrest while on the floor and massive splenic hemorrhage requiring splenic artery embolization.
A 10.5cm by 23mm Wallflex fully covered metal stent was placed successfully across the defect.
Fluconazole and Cefepime were continued.
She was extubated after the procedure but developed respiratory distress in the PACU, requiring reintubation which was felt to be secondary to pulmonary edema.
Her rhythm was noted to be VT/VF and a single shock was administered with return of pulse and blood pressure.
No medications were administered.
She was breathing spontaneuously but her respirations were felt to be feeble and she was intubated for airway protection following femoral line placement and administration of etomidate and succynylcholine.
Sedation was given with midazolam and fentanyl.
She was given multiple additional units of blood, 1 unit of platelets and taken to interventional radiology for splenic artery embolization.
Broad spectrum antibiotics were initiated and patient was pan-cultured as she started to spike fevers on and off during this time.
She was aggressively diuresed initially, for goal TBB -1.0 to -1.5 L but lasix drip was stopped in the setting of hypotension and increasing creatinine.
Increasing creatinine was also thought to be secondary to contrast dye needed for CT.  [**Hospital Unit Name 13533**] [**Date range (3) 83548**]:  Sputum culture grew MRSA, but patient was already being treated with vancomycin.
Repeat CT abdomen and pelvis revealed a large left-sided pleural effusion with collapse of the left lower lobe, small right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis, stable  splenic JP drain and infrasplenic fluid collection/hematoma, percutaneous J-tube without evidence of intestinal obstruction and no definitive abscesses.
Due to no identifiable source of infection in the setting of leukocytosis and fever, interventional pulmonology was called to perform thoracentesis of pleural effusion to rule out empyema.
[**Hospital1 18**] surgical team, [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] attending spoke with patient's family regarding goals of care and splenectomy was not an option given patient was a poor surgical candidate.
