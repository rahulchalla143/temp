Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view .
Sigmoidoscopy [**2103-11-23**] - Polyp at 8cm in the rectum - Polyps at the ranging distance from 18 cm to 28 cm in the distal sigmoid colon - Grade 2 internal hemorrhoids - Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to splenic flexure - Recommendations: Patient will need colonoscopy for removal of polyps when her alcoholic hepatitis improves and her INR is less than 1.5.
On floor tube feeds were started to augment nutrition and improve hepatitis.
She received Narcan in the ED to which there was a questionable improvement in her mental status.
She was given lactulose and rifaxamin, aiming for 4 bowel movements/day and was also started on empiric antibiotic coverage since she had a leukocytosis with the AMS including acyclovir, vancomycin, ampillicin, and ceftriaxone.
At that point, ampicillin was discontinued and the patient was continued on vanc/acyclovir, flagyl/ceftriaxone was added for intra abdominal pathology.
Antibiotics were changed to Vanc/Zosyn after she developed PNA.
The patient also has a drinking history and was started on thiamine.
On arrival to the floor her mental status continued to improve with lactulose and Rifaximin.
Creatinine continued to improve after albumin was given and with improvement in hepatitis.
# Aspiration pneumonia:  She developed aspiration pneumonia on [**11-17**] with a rising leukocytosis.
She was fed with a [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube and continued on vanc/zosyn.
She completed an HCAP course with Vanc/Zosyn and she remained on RA throughout duration of floor stay.
# Leukoctosis: Patient with profound leukocytosis which uptrended initially and remained elevated.
Leukocytosis remained elevated despite HCAP treatment and so WBCs thought most likely related to alcoholic hepatitis rather than infectious etiology.
Patient again felt this was menses though rectal exam with internal hemorrhoids.
She was maintained on a fluid restricted diet.
She later developed hypernatremia while she was on tube feeds only for aspiration.
After hepatitis and HCAP improved/resolved her Na remained stable requiring no further intervention.
# Peptic ulcer disease (PUD): she has a history of duodenal ulcers and was continued on pantoprazole.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Colonoscopy needs to be completed as an outpatient with removal of colonic polyps after INR improves - Patient counseled extensively on the importance of alcohol abstainence and she is agreeable with plan.
