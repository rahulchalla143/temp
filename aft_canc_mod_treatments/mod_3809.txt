She was admitted on [**2131-1-11**] for allogenic stem cell transplant per protocol DF05-279 and her conditioning regimen consisted of photophoresis, pentostatin, and TBI.
She has had two admissions for management of this, C.diff negative.
Flow--> CD34-positive blasts are estimated at 5-6% Biopsy/Aspirate-->From [**2130-12-28**]: The blast count on the aspirate is 6%, and by CD34-immunostains is 6-10%, consistent with a diagnosis of refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB-1) by WHO criteria.
Had sibling reduced-intensity Allogeneic Transplant [**2131-1-17**] that she tolerated well with minimal transfusion requirements.
There were minimal dysplastic changes but of uncertain significance.
.hypothyroidism - treated as outpatient on levothyroxine 50mcg, last TSH 5.2 in [**3-7**] pre-glaucoma - treated with travoprost uterine polyps GERD hypercholesterolemia.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Status post right breast lumpectomy for benign cyst 35 years ago, multiple D&Cs, laser wart removal, finger I&D.
She smoked for approximately 4 years in high school, she does not smoke and has stopped consuming alcohol, she has never used illegal drugs.
there is a 2x2cm area of local drainage but no obvious pocket of air or fluid.
Pathology of Nasal Turbinate [**2131-9-14**]: Respiratory mucosa with mild chronic inflammation and fungal forms consistent with aspergillus (GMS stain) seen.
On hospital day 6 she was developed fevers to 101.8, rigors and became hypotensive to 70/40 which did not respond to fluid boluses.
She was placed on cefepime, flagyl and tobramycin given previous pseudomonal sensitivities.
The patient's antibiotic coverage was broadened to include meropenem, daptomycin and clindamycin and ultimately switched to vancomycin and meropenem.
Her cellulitis slowly improved with broad spectrum antibiotics.
She completed a 21 day course of meropenem and vancomycin.
She was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics per the infectious disease service as described below.
She required pressors for blood pressure support.
She received aggressive volume resucitation with IVF, blood and albumin.
She was weaned off pressors after the initial 24 hour period but became hypotensive for a second time and was placed back on pressors for an additional 72 hours.
She completed a 21 day course of meropenem and vancomycin for her leg wound with slow clinical improvement.
Despite further aggressive care, she later developed both aspergillosis in lungs and CMV viremia.
Ultimately, however, despite multiple antibiotics, antifungals and antivirals, she did not overcome her numerous infections and succumbed to massive sepsis.
The patient was oliguric for approximately one week and subsequently became severely volume overloaded ultimately leading to intubation for respiratory distress.
The renal service was consulted who recommended aggressive diuresis.
Despite being on a lasix drip, her renal function continued to decline.
A discussion was held with her family and the Renal team concerning further course of therapy given that many of her medications were nephrotoxic and she may need dialysis.
In the last 24 hours of her life, however, she had a rapid decline related to her overwhelming sepsis and not renal function and never required HD prior to death.
The speciation of the mold suggested a non-pathogenic species but the patient's fungal markers were significantly elevated.
She underwent debridement of her nasal septum and turbinate on [**9-20**] and pathology results showed evidence of angioinvasive fungal infection.
She was treated initially with posiconazole and ambisome with close monitoring of her liver and kidney function.
Despite aggressive diuresis she continued to have poor NIFs and RSBIs.
She ultimately underwent trachestomy on [**9-20**] for prolonged respiratory failure.
The patient was initially treated with increasing doses of immunosuppresive agents including Solumedrol, cyclosporin and cellcept.
When she presented with sepsis her cellcept was discontinued and the doses of her other immunosuppresives were reduced.
Her steroids were intermittently increased and then decreased given the fine balance between managing her GVHD and controlling her multiple infections.
Thrombocytopenia:  Throughout her MICU course the patient has had significant thrombocytopenia requiring platelet transfusions.
The etiology of this is unclear but has been felt to be secondary to marrowsuppressive effects of her medications including gancyclovir and cyclosporin.
She received multiple red blood cell transfusions.
She has been treated with digoxin on a number of occassions as needed for rate control with good effect.
She was not anticoagulated given her thrombocytopenia and elevated IRN.
Her IV steroids were decreased to see if this would unmask GVHD of the liver.
Viral load trended up from 2960 to 49,000 and finally started trending down when started on higher induction doses of gancyclovir dosed for her creatinine clearance.
Her post-transplant course has been complicated by GVHD of the GI tract and CMV infection.
She currently is on reduced doses of cyclosporin and solumedrol for GVHD treatment.
Additionally, anticoagulation was held due to her thrombocytopenia, anemia and oozing from multiple wound sites.
Continue levothyroxine throughout her stay.
Continue sliding scale with insulin in TPN.
Ultimately, given these multiple medical problems and overwhelming infection, Mrs. [**Known lastname 916**] had a quick decompensation the last 24 hours of her death signaled by progressive bradycardia.
