He was started on hydrea and allopurinol and WBC responded decreasing to the 30's.
He was also noted to have a RLL opacity on CXR thus was started ceftriaxone on [**5-3**].
Sputum culutre grew out Klebsiella pneumonia and he was switched from Ceftriaxone to avelox on [**5-5**].
He was started on IV solumedrol, diuresed and initially improved.
He had persistent hemoptysis and required blood and platelet transfusions.
He underwent bronchoscopy which showed BAL with blood from RML, and BAL sent for multiple studies including cultures, fungal, AFB, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 13607**], cytology, cell count.
PA catheter was placed which demonstrated PCWP of 14, PA 44/20.

Visualized portions of the right kidney and pancreas are unremarkable.
While this can be seen in cholecystitis, there are no other findings to support this (such as gallstones or gallbladder distention) the differential diagnosis includes hypoalbuminemia, CHF, cirrhosis, pancreatitis and hepatitis.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 year-old man with history of myelofibrosis, COPD and hepatosplenomegaly who was initially transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 1459**] for management of hemoptysis, CHF, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia and who is now being transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] for tracheostomy and PEG placement.
He was started on hydrea and allopurinol, with his WBC decreasing to the 30's.
He was also noted to have a RLL opacity on CXR and on [**2116-5-3**] was started on ceftriaxone.
A sputum culutre grew out Klebsiella pneumonia and he was switched from Ceftriaxone to moxifloxacin on [**5-5**].
He was started on IV solumedrol, diuresed and initially improved.
He had persistent hemoptysis and required blood and platelet transfusions.
He required intubation and subsequently underwent a bronchoscopy which revealed blood from RML.
A PA catheter was placed which demonstrated PCWP of 14, PA 44/20.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was continued on the ventilator and eventually weaned and extubated on [**2116-5-19**].
Sputum cultures from [**5-12**] grew MRSA and he was started on vancomycin and zosyn on [**2116-5-11**].
He was continued on Zosyn and vancomycin and is currently on day 20, though continues to spike fevers.
He was recently placed on a lasix drip on [**5-29**] for volume overload, with reasonable urine output but this was stopped today due to hypernatremia and hypokalemia.
He didn't tolerate lasix drip previously related to hypotension.
However, Oncology noted the extrememly poor prognosis from his underlying disease, as well as the lack of realistic treatments other than bone marrow transplant for which he is not a candidate.
