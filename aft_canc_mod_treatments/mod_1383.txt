Admission Date:  [**2185-5-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-5-17**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pains, BRBPR  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Colonscopy done [**2185-5-11**]  History of Present Illness: The patient is an 89 year old female with a history of stroke, seizures, vascular dementia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and CAD who presented with complaints of abdominal pain, BRBPR and loose stools x 1 week.
Patient had a colonoscopy [**2185-4-29**] as part of an evaluaton for anemia which showed grade 1 internal hemorrhoids, a polyp that was removed via polypectomy and a cecal angioectesia that was treated via thermal therapy.
Due to concerns for C.difficile empiric Flagyl was started.
A chest x-ray showed a question of a retrocardiac opacity, so the patient was given levofloxacin/vancomycin in ED for PNA coverage.
Later, and updated read of the CT-abdomen questioned possible small diverticultis, and Flagyl was added.
She was admitted to medicine for further management.
S/P bilateral repair w/ Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7363**] of ophthalmology for dermatochalsis of the upper lids # Glaucoma # Stroke by CT .
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAM Vitals: T: 97.4 BP: 120/60 HR: 60 RR: 18 O2: 100% RA Eyes: EOMI, PERRL, conjunctiva clear, mildly injected bilaterally, anicteric, no exudate, ptosis right>left ENT: Dry MM Neck: No JVD, no LAD, no thyromegaly, no carotid bruits Cardiovascular: RRR, nl S1/S2, no m/r/g Respiratory: CTA bilaterally, comfortable, no wheezing, no ronchi, no rales Gastrointestinal: soft, midly distended, mildly tender in lower abdomen, no hepatosplenomegaly, normal bowel sounds Musculoskeletal/Extremities: no clubbing, no cyanosis, no joint  swelling, trace edema in the bilateral extremities Neurological: Alert and oriented x3, dysarthric speech but fluent, sensation WNL, CNII-XII intact except for right nasolabial fold flattening and right ptosis greater than left; unable to fully cooperate with strength exam despite redirection  but has 4-5/5 strength in all extremities with 4-/5 in right upper extremity .
Anterior fiborid appears necrotic, however, maligancy cannot be excluded and Gynecologic evaluation for surgical management is recommended.
Gynecologic evaluation for surgical management is recommended.
She then needed 5 total units blood and 3+ liters of IVFs to correct her hypotension which reached a nadir of 50/palpation.
GI team followed her closely in the inpatient setting and performed a STAT colonoscopy on [**5-11**] when she had marked increase in her lower GI bleeding but there was no clear bleeding source; severe diverticulosis and grade 2 internal hemorrhoids were noted.
There was very little bleeding above the level of the cecum during scope procedure so the GI service felt she did not have any upper GI sources.
Polypectomy and thermal treatment to her angioectasias in cecum done the first week in [**Month (only) 547**] just prior to her complaints of bleeding so the timeline certainly favors a re-bleed from one of these sites.
Blood pressure medications were all held and she was initially placed on [**Hospital1 **] IV Protonix which was later switched to PO q-daily PPI and at discharge she can return to her usual home omeprazole therapy.
Team has been holding usual Plavix therapy for her CVA history due to GI bleeding.
Patient allergic to aspirin so she had not been placed on any aspirin for her CVAs.
Through her hospital course she was advanced from NPO to clear fluids and then to a regular PO diet which she has been tolerating very well for several days now leading up to discharge.
She had a drop to 50/palp on medical floor [**5-10**] but recovered after IVFs and 5 additional units of blood were given.
Most likely hypovolemic related drop from blood loss but she had a persistent leukocytosis concerning for inflammatory contributions to her hypotension as well, SIRS/sepsis etiology was in the differential initially but despite multiple tests and antibiotics she continued to have an elevated WBC and given the chronic course of her leukocytosis and all of her negative blood cultures it seemed much more likely that her BP drop was secondary to volume losses with GI bleeding vs. any infections.
She was placed on a few days of oral Vancomycin alongside IV Flagyl briefly but after two C. difficile stool studies returned negative these were stopped.
She was continued on PO Flagyl however after a CT done [**5-7**] noted some area that was consistent with mild diverticulitis.
After repeat CT Abdomen done [**5-15**] showed again mild diverticulitis she was started on a 7 day course of Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl, her last day should be [**2185-5-23**].
Initial diarrhea was probably from combination of her diverticulitis and added cathartic effects of GI bleeding.
A positive E.Coli UTI was discovered for which she was given IV Ceftriaxone x 7 days; completed on [**2185-5-16**].
Therefore she was continued on a 7 day course of Cipro/Flagyl at discharge.
#Hypertension: Initially she had low to normotensive blood pressures and as above she became hypotensive in setting of GI bleeding so her usual HCTZ BP medication were held.
#Pelvic Mass: CT noted multiple degenerating fibroids with exophytic necrotic characteristics which were concerning.
Per patient, no prior post-menopausal bleeding.
Given allergy to aspirin and her bleeding this medication is contraindicated.
She was continued on her usual Travoprost, Timolol Maleate drops and Latanoprost.
Team continued holding Plavix due to GI bleeding concerns.
She will discuss when to restart this medication with PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 702**].
She was continued on her usual Keppra therapy daily.
#Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition: Advanced diet slowly from NPO to clear liquids and then to regular diet which she has been tolerating well.
Monitored and repleted electrolytes as needed.
#Prophylaxis: Ms. [**Known lastname 34601**] was continue on daily PPI and pneumoboots placed for DVT prevention.
She was also seen by physical therapy to help her attempt ambulation and do occasional exercises and get out of bed and into the bedside chair.
