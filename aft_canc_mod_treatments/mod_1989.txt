Infectious disease:  The patient continued on intravenous Vancomycin to day 27 and remained afebrile and stable without white blood cell count elevation and with negative surveillance cultures.
He will require four weeks of additional antibiotics treatment for his sacral abscess.
He was continued on Flagyl t.i.d.
The infectious disease team was consulted again on [**2-29**] further recommendations for antibiotic treatment in the setting of placement of a pacemaker.
He will require continual CBC, liver function tests and electrolyte monitoring at rehab.
Cardiovascular:  The patient was hypotensive on admission upon the initial transfer to the MICU he was placed on pressors for one day and was weaned off and became normotensive during his hospital stay on the floor.
He was continued on a beta blocker.
In regard to his atrial fibrillation the patient was followed by EP and was initially placed on a beta-blocker for rate control with a plan for cardioversion in the future, however, during his hospital stay the patient was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response that was minimally responsive to beta-blocker and then with the addition of Diltiazem and transient periods two times with nonrestrictive to Digoxin.
Digoxin and Coumadin was started post procedure.
On [**2-22**] the patient was in normal sinus rhythm with beta-blocker and Digoxin continuing.
Over the next three days the patient's Digoxin was discontinued and his Metoprolol was decreased due to concerns of bradycardia and frequent pauses.
The patient remained with bradycardia and frequent pauses with occasional palpitations.
Amiodarone was initiated and Coumadin was restarted without a heparin bridge.
He will continue on Coumadin with a goal anticoagulation INR 2 to 3.
Oncology:  The patient has multiple myeloma and continued Thalidomide and Decadron treatment per his usual protocol.
After discussing the case with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] the patient was given a dose of Pamidronate 90 mg times one and 35 gram dose of IVIG.
He had a history of a deep venous thrombosis and was kept therapeutic with anticoagulation for the large majority of his hospital stay.
When his INR did fall below 2 he was bridged with Lovenox from [**2-28**] through the 18th.
He continues on Coumadin for anticoagulation at this point.
Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was continued on zinc and vitamin C to promote wound healing.
Access:  The patient had a left PICC line for the majority of his hospital stay, however, this had to be removed for pacer placement.
On [**3-4**] the patient was brought to interventional radiology for proper readjustment and placement of the PICC in the SVC.
DISPOSITION:  The patient did well with physical therapy and had dramatic improvement of his lower extremity strength during his hospital stay.
The patient will need to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of Plastic Surgery in regard to further management of his sinus tract.
