Pateint was started on furosemide IV then transitioned to a furosemide gtt and diuresed approximately 3L daily.
Then she was started on an oral diuretic regimen of torsemide 80mg PO BID.
Metoprolol was started and uptitrated to 75mg [**Hospital1 **].
Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: She was initially on a diltiazem drip for rate control, then transitioned to diltiazem PO and metoprolol PO.
She was started on a full dose aspirin and heparin drip with plan to bridge to warfarin, although she had recurrence of GI bleeding, which is discussed below so heparin gtt was stopped and aspirin was continued.
At discharge, she was on aspirin for anticoagulation only, with no coumadin as she has a high risk of rebleeding.
She then complained of productive cough and increased wheezing so was treated with a steroid taper, and 5 day course of azithromycin.
Her prednisone taper will be continued for 10mg for the next two days, followed by 5mg QD for one week, followed by 5mg every other day for the last week, then discontinued.
She was also continued on her home regimen of spiriva, fluticasone-salmeterol, montelukast, and [**Doctor First Name 130**].
Theophylline was discontinued due to adverse effects and narrow therapeutic index as well as drug interaction.
Hypertension: On admission, she was borderline hypotensive, so her home BP medications were held.
She was gradually uptitrated on diltiazem and metoprolol, which was well tolerated.
Anemia/Recurrent GIB: Patient was tried on a heparin drip for her atrial fib, and had guaiac positive stools and a downtrending hematocrit.
The heparin was stopped, although she continued to require occasional blood transfusions, 4 units in total.
