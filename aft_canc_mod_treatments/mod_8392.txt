IMAGING [**6-10**] CXR FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: A right-sided tunneled line terminates at the upper right atrium, unchanged in position since [**2112-12-13**].
An overlying EKG lead along the left neck limits evaluation of line placement in this region.
IMPRESSION: A new central access line tip in addition to a known tunneled line could not be visualized.
A repeat study could be performed with improved EKG lead placement and better patient positioning.
Prominent precarinal node measures 8 mm.
Anterior fusion hardware is seen in the imaged upper cervical spine.
#Fevers, tachycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis: He initially presented with hypotension, tachycardia, and leukocytosis.
His CXR was not notable but UA showed may WBCs and he was initially started on ceftriaxone.
The catheter tip culture did not grow anything and multiple rounds of blood cultures were negative.
He was treated with 7 days of vancomycin which finished [**2113-6-22**], 7 days of ceftazadime (to finish [**2113-6-24**]) and fluconazole (last day [**2113-6-26**]).
Fevers from his HCC or from medications were also considered.
Initially this was felt to be from morphine buildup from ESRD.
However his mental status did not reach his baseline and he was later made NPO to help prevent aspiration.
We continued dialysis, antibiotics, and procedures including tunnled line placement and NG tube placement.
# ESRD on HD: tunneled HD line replaced as above.
Dialysis continued on tuesday, thursday, saturday schedule.
# Hypertension, benign: He was on amlodipine, carvedilol, lasix, metolazone at home but because of his low blood pressures these were held and not restarted.
#Diabetes mellitus: He was on lantus and sliding scale insulin on admission.
He was continued on a homalog sliding scale.
#Pain medication: If he needs further pain medications please avoid morphine.
