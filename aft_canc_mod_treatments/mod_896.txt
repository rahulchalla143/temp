She also complained of pleurisy in her left back particularly when taking in deep breaths.
At the outside hospital, she was noted to be pale, dry, and with cool extremities.
O2 saturation was 85% and increased to 100% on non-rebreather.
She was treated with fluids, Albuterol, and Ceftriaxone, and subsequently transferred here.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history revealed atrial fibrillation status post cardioversion on Sotalol, last echocardiogram in 1/00 showed an ejection fraction greater than 55% and normal systolic function; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with an FEV1/FVC of 68%; atrial septal defect status post repair in [**2155**]; and small cell carcinoma status post radiation and Cisplatin.
MEDICATIONS:  Prednisone 10 mg q. day, Lasix 20 mg q. day, Singulair 10 mg q. day, Coumadin 5/7.5 mg q.h.s., Betapace 40 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Xanax 5 mg p.o.
q.d., Paxil 10 mg p.o.
q.d., Motrin 400 mg p.o.
p.r.n., Albuterol p.r.n.
She was afebrile with blood pressure of 112/90, pulse 84, saturation 91% on 4 liters nasal cannula and 80% on room air.
SMA-7 showed sodium 129, potassium 4.9, chloride 94, bicarbonate 28, BUN 34, creatinine 2.8, glucose 122, CK 46.
She eventually ruled out for myocardial infarction by CKs and as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] we continued Sotalol for her atrial fibrillation despite her COPD exacerbation.
She was continued on telemetry and there were no further events.
The patient received pulse dose of steroids with Solu-Medrol 80 mg intravenously t.i.d.
and this was transitioned to Prednisone 60 mg p.o.
for a tapered course over 14 days.
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers were continued as well as Flovent.
She received empiric treatment of pneumonia given her cough, hemoptysis, and bandemia with Levaquin.
We could not initiate CT angiogram given her renal failure nor VQ given her effusions.
As for her hemoptysis, this engaged a broad differential including bronchitis, cancer, and pneumonia versus pulmonary embolus.
She was hydrated with goal intake and output positive one liter and her creatinine subsequently climbed close to baseline on discharge.
All her medications were renally dosed.
Levofloxacin was continued for presumed pneumonia.
The patient was reluctant to use oxygen at home but following review with case management, this could be provided by her insurance and she agreed to this.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lasix 20 mg p.o.
q.d., Singulair 10 mg p.o.
q.d., Coumadin 5 mg alternating with 7.5 mg p.o.
q.h.s., Betapace 40 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Xanax 0.5 mg p.o.
q.d., Paxil 10 mg p.o.
q.d., no Motrin, Combivent 2 puffs q.i.d., Albuterol p.r.n., Prednisone taper beginning with 50 mg to taper over 10 days, Levaquin 500 mg p.o.
for a total 10 day course to end on [**2160-5-8**], Zantac 150 mg p.o.
