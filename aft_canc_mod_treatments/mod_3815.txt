Pt taken to OR on [**12-13**], and tolerated minimally invasive esophagogastrectomy well, and was transferred to the ICU in stable condition.
Trophic tube feeds were initiated through his J-tube on post-op day 3.
A swallow study on post-op day 7 showed good integrity of the anastomosis, and 2 of his 3 chest tubes were removed, leaving one on the right.
On [**12-20**], it was noted that his chest tube drainage appeared chylous, and a PICC line was placed to facilitate TPN, as his enteral tube feeds were aggravating the leak.
The continuing drainage from the chest tube was noted to be non-chylous.
His chest tube was removed on [**12-25**].
Although he was close to goal tube feeds as o this time, it was difficult to get him to a shorter, nocturnal cycle.
However, he was on bolus tube feeds at home, and his discharge instructions to [**Hospital1 1474**] VNA include plans to gradually transition him to nocturnal cycling.
