On review of systems, he denies any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, SOB, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, abdominal pain, weakness, numbness, or tingling.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia (diet controlled) S/p tonsillectomy CLL (see below) .
He then completed four cycles of FCR therapy, which he completed back in 09/[**2119**].
He had an excellent response to therapy and was monitored off treatment for approximately two years.
He then received four cycles of PCR, but did not have much in the way of response and his treatment regimen was switched to R-CVP of which he received two cycles.
He had received chemotherapy initially through 06/[**2122**].
We had decided to observe him off treatment, and ultimately, we had decided to move forward with an allogeneic stem cell transplant; however, back at the end of the summer, his donor had backed out.
He has been followed closely by ID and has been treated on Augmentin since that time through therapy.
He then was restarted back on Campath and completed six weeks of treatment dose as previously his cycles have been interrupted.
He completed his first course of ESHAP on [**2124-2-2**], and tolerated this well.
Four cycles of FCR (Fludarabine, Cytoxan, Rituxan) completed on [**2120-8-15**], four cycles of PCR (Pentostatin, Cytoxan, Rituxan) completed on [**2122-10-1**], two cycles of R-CVP completed on [**2123-3-11**], Campath treatment subcutaneously initiated on [**2123-4-14**] and stopped on [**2123-4-30**], reinitiated on [**2123-6-23**] and stopped on [**2123-7-7**], restarted on [**2123-10-11**] and completed approximately six weeks of therapy which he completed on [**2123-12-3**].
Reinitiated therapy due to [**Doctor Last Name 6261**] transformation with [**Hospital1 **] treatment (Continuous infusion of etoposide, Adriamycin, and Vincristine on days [**11-21**], Oral prednisone on days [**11-22**], and Cytoxan on day 5) in 02/[**2123**].
D/t inadequate disease response from [**Hospital1 **] regimen was switched to ESHAP (Bolus of Etoposide on days [**11-21**], Cisplatin continuous infusion on days [**11-21**], Methylprednisolone IV on days [**11-22**], Cytarabine 2g/m2 IV over 2 hours on day 5 only).

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56-year-old male with history of CLL with large cell transformation who was admitted for a scheduled allogeneic MUD SCT on [**2124-3-10**].
The patient underwent a Busulfan/Cytoxan conditioning regimen which did not cause neutropenia and he tolerated it with only mild diarrhea.
His initial transplant proceeded without incident.
The patient was started on Acyclovir, Fluconazole and Ursodiol per protocol on Day -2.
Cyclosporine was started Day -1 and monitored by level.
He received inhaled pentamidine on a monthly basis ([**3-29**] and [**4-30**]).
He was started on atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis on [**4-8**].
Fungal prophylaxis was switched micafungin while the patient had fever & neutropenia.
The patient was on voriconazole for a short period of time, but changed back to micafungin due to concern of exacerbating chemotherapy induced liver toxicity.
The patient was treated with high-dose (2mg/kg) methylprednisone, cellcept, cyclosporine and Remicade x 2 ([**4-14**] and [**4-22**]).
After his second dose of remicade, his symptoms improved and a very slow steroid taper was reattempted.
Steroid taper was ultimately unsuccessful with patient requiring methylprednisolone 25 mg in am and 20 mg in pm.
The cefepime was switched to meropenem and derm was once again consulted on [**5-31**].
# Fevers and neutropenia - The patient developed fevers in the setting of neutropenia post transplant on [**3-13**] and was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and antifungal coverage.
His counts recovered ([**3-22**]) and antibiotics were discontinued.
# VRE bacteremia - The patient developed bloody diarrhea and underwent colonoscopy for evaluation ([**5-18**]).
He was started on linezolid and cefepime.
His IJ was removed as was his PICC line for access.
The patient was continued on meropenem, linezolid and flagyl was added to cover potential c. diff.
His PICC was removed with no resolution of the fevers.
The patient was treated with vancomycin initially and then switched to ceftazadime and flagyl and then to cefepime per ID recommendations.
# BK virus: In early [**Month (only) **], while the patient was on multiple immunosuppressant medications for GVHD, he developed dysuria, difficulty voiding and hematuria.
His bladder spasms were symptomatically managed with flomax, detrol, pyridium and a morphine PCA.
ID was consulted and they recommended treatment with intravesicular cedofivir.
It was thought that the most likely cause was metabolic encephalopathy secondary to one of his medications.
At that time he was given a cyclosporin holiday and changed to tacrolimus with a recovery of his mental status to baseline.
He is also on steroids and mycophenolate and received etanercept.
His anti-hypertensive medications required frequent adjustment during this hospitalization.
His Diltiazem was changed to Nifedipine due to concern regarding hepatotoxicity.
His metoprolol dose was increased.
On [**6-11**] nifedipine was stopped due to low blood pressures.
#) Anascarca: The patient's severe GVHD caused an inflammatory state with required aggressive fluid replacement.
Once his GVHD stabilized, he was diuresed with lasix which at one point caused prerenal acute renal failure with a creatinine peak of 1.7.
#) Superficial venous clots: On [**4-14**], the patient developed superficial venous clots in his left cephalic and basilic veins near a PICC line site.
He had a Hickmann tunnelled catheter which was removed because it was non-functional.
He also had right PICC x2 (the first of which was removed due to a superficial phlebitis), a left IJ, a right subclavian (removed when the patient was bacteremic) and a right IJ.
# Hypothermia / MS changes: Multiple possible etiologies in the immunocompromised pt s/p BMT,  concern for sepsis given elevated lactate (although unclear as to what pt's baseline lactate level is given malignancy and adenopathy, was stable at 3.0 on transfer) and resp alkalosis.
Pt had recent VRE bacteremia, after central line placement, the midline was removed and sent for culture.
LP was performed and suggestive of possible aseptic meningitis, etiologies include HSV and other viruses (CMV, HHV, number of others sent out) vs malignancy related as 99% lymphs on tap vs drug (chemo/immunosup) toxicity.
The pt reported having some loose stools but C. diff was negative and empiric flagyl treatment was d/c'd.
Atovaquone was restarted when pt able to PO clear liquid diet.
2U pRBC given.
The patient was restarted on etanercept on [**6-28**].
He was switched to lomotil which has alleviated the diarrhea somewhat.
During his most recent episode on [**2124-7-12**], his blood pressure also dropped to 90/60, and he was started on meropenem and daptomycin because of the possibility of sepsis.
The patient's blood pressure improved with boluses and antibiotics.
MRI head was negative, and LP glucose, protein were normal.
However, repeat level on [**7-6**] showed decreasing adenovirus levels and cidofivir was not started.
He was not on anticoag due to hx of GI bleeds, following clinically.
Both episodes were managed conservatively with fluids given that the likely etiology was graft vs. host disease.
#Ascites/edema - The patient was placed on lasix 20bid to improve his overall anasarca and ascites.
He continued on immunosuppressive regimen of cellcept, Budesonide, Methylprednisolone and enterecept.
He was also started on Rituxan once per week and had received [**1-19**] doses by the time of discharge.
On discharge, patient was kept on Methylprednisone 25mg AM/20mg PM, Cellcept 750mg every 8 hours and budesonide 3mg TID.
He will receive one more dose of Rituxan on [**8-19**].
Hepatology was consulted and a paracentesis was performed in early [**Month (only) **] that was essentially non-diagnostic, ascites cultures were negative, and the picture was essentially consistent with portal hypertension.
Rifaxamin was started.
Rifaxamin was stopped without consequence.
An LP performed on [**7-14**] was non diagnostic and all viral studies from that procedure were negative.
Was put on a warmer.
In fact, the pt's blood pressure and heart rate began to increase the week after Metoprolol was d/c'd and was added back in with a decrease in bp and pulse seen.
He was d/c'd on Metoprolol 12.5 TID with steady vitals.
For the next several weeks in [**Month (only) **], the pt would occasionally have dark red stools, which required occasional PRBC transfusion, but never compromised him from a hemodynamic standpoint.
He also received occasional platelets --> During [**Month (only) **], the pt required 6U of PRBC's and 5 of platelets.
Adenoviremia: Patient was found to have >100,000 copies of adenovrius in his blood on [**6-28**], also with adenovirus in CSF from [**6-26**].
3000 and cidofivir was not started.
A repeat measurement later in [**Month (only) **] showed a titer of 696, and no specific therapy was started.
After Metoprolol was d/c'd and hypotension resolved, Lasix was increased to 40mg IV bid with appropriate response.
He continued to put out urine and as his anasarca steadily decreased his Lasix was tapered.
His Lasix was stopped.
Nutrition: The patient was started on TPN while his mental status was poor and he was not eating, but by the time he began to wake up he was requesting food.
He had also pulled out two central lines by this point and did not have access for TPN anyways.
So he was given a trial to take PO on his own, which he has done well with by the time of discharge.
No specific therapy was initiated.
Disposition: The pt basically needs aggressive rehabilitation at this point, as he has major proximal LE muscle wasting and myopathy likely due to long term steroid use.
He is eating and drinking well and needs to be encouraged to eat and drink.
