The nausea/vomiting was a likely complication of your recent chemotherapy for metastatic lung cancer.
CT scan of the abdomen showed increased fluid in your abdomen (ascites) and you underwent a paracentesis (drainage of fluid from the abdomen).
Nausea and vomiting worsened despite nausea medication and you then aspirated some vomit (going down the wind-pipe into the lungs) causing a severe pneumonia.
You had an episode of low blood pressure and were satrted on IV antibiotics.
Because your oxygen was dangerously low, you were transferred to the Intensive Care Unit and needed oxygen support for several days.
Therefore, you remained on the current dose of enoxaparin (Lovenox).
Your white blood cell count was low due to chemotherapy and a medication called G-CSF (Neupogen) was given to help this.
You also became temporarily delirious (confused) because of a dose of lorazepam (Ativan) given for nausea.
You should never take this medication again.
After IV fluids, electrolyte replacement for low potassium and low phosphorous, and loperamide (Immodium), the diarrhea improved.
You will need to complete a course of antibiotics for the pneumonia.
Baclofen 10 mg 3x a day as needed for hiccups.
Amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) 2x a day for three days to complete the antibiotic course for aspiration pneumonia.
DO NOT TAKE LORAZEPAM (ATIVAN).
