Prior to the procedure you were administered 3 units of plasma and one unit of platelets.
You tolerated the procedure well and did not appear to have persistent bleeding afterwards however your blood levels came down due to some mild blood loss accompanied by the large volume of fluids and plasma products delivered.
For this we transfused you 1 unit of red blood cells and we gave you lasix (medicine to get the extra water out of your system).
She will follow up these results with you and guide further management options.
You should take your lasix 20mg by mouth daily until you return to your previous "dry" weight.
Then resume weighing yourself daily and take lasix on an as needed basis for weight gain >3pounds.
You should have blood drawn on Monday and sent to your PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] set up by your PCP prior to admission.
