IMPRESSION: Grossly stable appearance of numerous pulmonary metastases, without new consolidation.
Initially transferred to MICU following rigid bronch with photodynamic therapy and blood clot extraction in OR by interventional pulmonology.
- IP visualized clot and extracted it, and also performed a partial resection and coagulation of the obstructive lesion with subsequent improvement in RLL aeration - The patient was observed in the MICU for 6 days without incident, was taken back for bronchoscopy on [**3-15**] and [**3-18**] for debridement and photodynamic therapy, see operative reports for details - During the last two procedures the [**Hospital1 **] was found to be patent, but the area behind the obstructing lesion was noted to be full of purulent secretions - These secretions were aspirated by the IP team, with concern for post obstructive pneumonia - Her oxygenation improved, and she was then transferred to the floor on [**3-18**] - She will be seen by the IP team in 2 weeks for follow up bronchoscopy, no further debridement took place during her admission  # Post obstructive pneumonia - She was started on a course of IV vanc/cefepime in the MICU, no culture data available from bronchoscopy - Completed an 8 day course of therapy on [**3-23**] - Consistency and frequency of purulent secretions improved over the course of her stay on the floor with no signs of recurrent or persistent pneumonia - Supportive therapies included albuterol and ipatropium nebs, guaifensin, chest PT, and frequent ambulation - On day of discharge, the patient was sat'ing in the high 90's on 2LNC at rest, with a desaturation to the high 80's off of oxygen while ambulating - Serial CXR's showed interval improvement in the aeration of the RLL, with persistent opacification of the RUL  #.
