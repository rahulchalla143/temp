[** **] Date:  [**2109-2-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2109-3-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-5-18**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10593**] Chief Complaint: tachycardia, low hct, guaiac + stool   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: EAST HOSPITAL MEDICINE ATTENDING [**First Name3 (LF) **] NOTE  Date: [**2110-1-21**] Time: 23:20  The patient is a Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 58 year old F with Multiple Sclerosis with recent discharge for UTI, altered mental status, bilateral DVT's, and new diagnosis of ovarian cancer, who presents with tachycardia and drop in hemoglobin/hematocrit and guaiac positive stools, but not gross blood.
Pt recently admitted and started on lovenox for DVT and was discharged yesterday.
Had 5pt Hct drop while in house in the setting of diagnostic paracentesis to eval for malignant ascites, transfused 1U PRBC with good response (28->23->1 pRBCs->28).
GI consulted and recommended 2 u pRBCs and pantoprazole 40mg [**Hospital1 **].
She was given CTX x1 for UTI, 1 unit PRBC's, IV pantoprazole.
She only endorses feeling thirsty and hungry.
Denies visual changes, headache, dizziness, sinus tenderness, neck stiffness, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat or dysphagia.
Soft tissue implants are also noted along the right hepatic lobe extending into [**Location (un) 6813**] pouch and along the right kidney and paracolic gutter, right anterior omentum, periportal space tracking along the falciform ligament, gastrohepatic ligament, and splenic hilum tracking inferiorly along the left paracolic gutter.
There is centralization of bowel loops and viscera, compatible with malignant ascites.
A Foley catheter is present, with balloon inflated at the bladder dome, and tip kinking the bladder anterosuperiorly.
Transitional lumbosacral anatomy is noted at L5-S1 on the left.
Marked deformity of the sacrum, which is deviated to the left, with apparent post-traumatic deformity at S1-S2.
This demonstrates mixed hyper- and hypodense components, compatible with acute-on-subacute hemorrhage.
Deep venous thrombosis, with IVC filter in place.
On lovenox for DVTs, so has increased risk of bleeding.
# Tachycardia: She was also tachycardic during last [**Date Range **], attributed at that time to hypermetabolic state and metoprolol was uptitrated from XL 75mg daily to 37.5mg TID.
Restarted metoprolol at slightly lower dose (25mg TID) to avoid rebound tachycardia.
Her HR decreased with blood transfusion and IV fluids to 90s-100s.
Metoprolol was held briefly for concern of further GI bleeding, however HR increased to 120s without further evidence of bleeding so metoprolol was restarted at 25mg TID just prior to trasnfer to medicine floor.
Later, she was unable to take po metoprolol, so this was switched to iv metoprolol, initially 2.5 mg iv q6h, then up to 7.5 mg iv q6h.
# DVT: She has an IVC filter placed and has been on Lovenox since her last [**Month (only) **].
Heparin ggt held in ICU given concern for bleed.
Restarted iv heparin when Hct stabilized.
Switched to Lovenox 50 mg sc bid on [**2-25**] (she had been on 60 mg sc bid at the time of last discharge).
Last hospitalization several days prior to [**Month/Year (2) **] showed urine culture of ampicillin sensitive enterococcus.
?Reportedly needs lifelong Ampicillin prophylaxis, so she was continued on this on [**Month/Year (2) **].
Two week course of ampicillin was completed on [**2-24**].
# Multiple Sclerosis: Not on medications currently.
On provigil and baclofen at home.
She was unable to take her po meds, and her po intake of food was quite limited.
Lumbar puncture was not done, as she had had a complication (hematoma) from an LP during a previous hospitalization, and findings of LP were very unlikely to change management.
Given the extent of her cancer and her poor functional status, she was not a candidate for surgery nor for chemotherapy.
