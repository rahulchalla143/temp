She underwent extensive evaluation for possible metastatic disease including head MRI, PetCT and bronchoscopy, however although Pet revealed markedly FDG avid right lower lobe mass with a satellite nodule, transbronchial biopsy and washings were non diagnostic.
Patient was electively admitted today to have repeat rigid bronchoscopy with FNA of lymph nodes under ultrasound guidance.
Patient was extubated without difficulty however she remained hypoxic and is still requiring supplemental oxygen.
Patient was given Lasix 20mg IV and was admitted to MICU team for further management.

Patient initially did well on oxygen by facemask with diuresis, but on [**3-22**] patient had increased respiratory distress associated with ventricular tachycardia, and was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
Patient initially received empirical levaquin for presumed CAP, but antimicrobials were empirically broadened to Vanco/Cefepime on [**3-22**].
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where her respiratory status improved with diuresis and antibitiocs transiently but ultimately she could not be weaned from the Vent.
Several family meetings were held during the course of her hospitalization, and with lack of progress and continued dependence on mechanical ventialtion, consistent with the patients previsously expressed wishes that long term mechanical ventilation was not acceptable quality of life, she was terminally extubated.
4 episodes over ~30 minutes which responded to amiodarone (150 x 2 and then 0.5 mg/min drip) and respiratory support.
Was intubated and started on amiodarone drip with no more episodes.
Completed amiodarone drip but continued to have NSVT, which resolved following repositioning of a central venous catheter on [**3-26**].
Started on heparin drip until troponin plateaud.
# Hypercalcemia: Albumin only 2.2 so corrected calcium actually >12.
Patient received lasix and pamidronate.
