Her hematocrit bumped appropriately after three units of pRBC transfusion, and she remained hemodynamically stable.
She was continued on pantoprazole and an octreotide drip overnight, per GI recommendations.
Following transfer to the floor, octreotide was discontinued, and proton pump inhibition was transitioned from intravenous to oral upon discharge.
No Portal Vein Thrombosis was seen on on abdominal ultrasound, but liver metastases were found.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.
The Palliative Care team recommended giving patient an outpatient prescription for Ritalin to increase her mood and energy level.
