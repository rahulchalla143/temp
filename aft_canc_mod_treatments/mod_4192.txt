[**Name10 (NameIs) **] that time she had a normocytic anemia 32.5, AST 74, ALT 148, t bili 0.2, ap 97, lipase 32.
She underwent cholecystectomy and 1 week post op developed pericardial effusion.
Blood cx sent and patient started on ceftriaxone.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: Pericardial fluid CELL BLOCK  Procedure date     Tissue received     Report Date    Diagnosed by [**2106-6-29**] [**2106-6-30**] [**2106-7-2**] DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/nab??????
Immunohistochemical studies show diffuse staining of the atypical cells with cytokeratin 7.
The atypical cells also show rare focal staining with cytokeratin 20.
Successful pericardiocentesis for large pericardial effusion.
2. leave drain in place overnight 3. if drainage is < 75 cc / shift overnight, then will remove the drain.
IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive deep vein thrombosis in the right subclavian vein.
Recommend further evaluation on chest CT. 4.
IMPRESSION: Trivial amount of pericardial fluid located close to the right atrium.
The patient is status post cholecystectomy with surgical clips in the right upper quadrant.
Brief Hospital Course: 43 yo F p/w recurrent pericardial effusion w/ tamponade and RUE swelling, found to have RUL opacity, lymphadenopathy on CT and R subclavian DVT US, now s/p pericardiocentesis w drain (dc'd).
She underwent pericardiocentesis with percardial drain placement, which drained serosanguinous fluid and was discontinued on [**6-30**].
Atrius heme-onc attending following pt - wants to consider holding off on IP biopsy and waiting for path to come back on pericardial fluid since it has malignant cells.
She received 3 RBC units, underwent R-femoral line cordis placement and heparin was stopped.
Once on OMED service, patient received another unit of blood prior to starting chemo.
She was admitted to private room with respiratory precautions for r/o Tb.
The differential dx of the finding included malignancy, TB/infectious, autoimmune.
ID was consulted early in her admission and recommended mycoplasma serologies, urine legionella (neg), swab throat/rectum for viral cultures, CMV, EBV, Urine histoplasma ag, induced sputum x3, repeat PPD (planted [**6-30**]), add on adenosine deaminase and Tb pcr to pericardial fluid, HIV test (declined).
# Transaminitis: No hx of liver disease, statin tx, herbal supplements or EtOH.
Has 2 PIVs but no venous access for labs, team has been art sticking for labs daily and PTT trending.
Pt had femoral line placed after transfer to MICU.
Goal for better pain control and monitoring Hct.
Haptoglobin decreased.
Her heparin and indomethacin were discontinued.
She was transfused 3 units of packed RBCs.
Her reactive ileus eventually responded to an aggressive bowel regimen, but did temporarily require an NG tube for decompression.
Likely secondary to her ileus, increased intrabdominal pressure, and splinting the patient developed respiratory distress requiring supplemental oxygen from which she was weaned after abdominal decompression.
Anti-coagulation was held given hemoperitoneum and brain met.
IP took the patient for bronchoscopy and performed transbronchial biopsies, cytologic brushes, and bronchoalveolar lavage.
A PICC was placed and her femoral line was pulled.
Finally, a permanent IVC filter was placed by IR.
While on the floor she continued to be on heparin drip.
#DVT For her upper extremity clots she is bridged with lovenox prior to discharge.
For her brain mets, she received a treatment with cybeknife.
#Transaminitis - patient's transaminitis that started while she was in the unit reoccured, with unclear etiology, nothing new on Ultrasound aside from NAFL.
