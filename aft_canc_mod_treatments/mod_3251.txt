Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the colorectal surgery service on [**2188-10-20**] after she underwent laparoscopic converted to open proctectomy with colostomy for rectal cancer.
She tolerated the procedure well, was extubated without difficulty, and after an uneventful stay in the PACU was transferred to the floor.
She was initially maintained on IV lopressor standing, and then transitioned to her home atenolol, diovan, and simvastatin.
On exam she was in no acute distress, EKG and CXR were stable and she responded well to nebulizer treatments.
FEN/GI: Postoperatively the patient underwent ostomy teaching which she understood well.
However, following this procedure she continued to have purulent drainage from her wound.
As a result, her wound was partially opened superiorly and inferiorly and a VAC was placed on [**2188-10-29**] with a skin bridge (with underlying white foam sponge).
On discharge her wound was noted to be granulating well with a fibrinous base.
GU: Postoperatively on [**10-28**] her foley cathether was discontinued, however she failed a voiding trial, and therefore her foley was replaced.
