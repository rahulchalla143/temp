She was also status post rib resection and tube drainage.
Following the bronchoscopy in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit she was complaining of increased shortness of breath.
She was treated with nebulizers.
The stent was removed and a biopsy was done around the site to rule out recurrent cancer.
This was sealed with fibrin glue.
Following the procedure she continued to have large amount of secretions and respiratory distress and was ultimately intubated.
Chem-7 revealed a sodium of 143, potassium 4.2, chloride 106, bicarbonate 26, BUN 20, creatinine 0.8.
Her arterial blood gases immediately prior to intubation was 7.23/66/64.
It was felt that her failure to wean off of the ventilator may have been related to anxiety.
For this she was given Ativan and Roxicodone as needed as she takes similar medicines at home.
She was also started on Ceftazidime and Vancomycin given the presence of both Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas in her sputum.
She remained with a lowgrade tachycardia throughout her hospital course.
Nevertheless, chest computerized tomography scan was obtained with angiography to rule out pulmonary embolus.
On [**11-26**], the patient was tolerating minimal ventilatory support and was extubated.
Ativan was also tried.
Racemic epinephrine was also tried.
However, the hematocrit was low and the patient was transfused 3 units of packed red blood cells.
Numerous discussions were held with the patient and her health care proxy and other family members.
It became clear that the patient's pulmonary status is not such much an acute decompensation as it is representation of a continuing decline in her pulmonary status over the past several months.
