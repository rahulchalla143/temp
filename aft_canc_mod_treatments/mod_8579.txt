The patient presented originally for elective stenting of left internal carotid artery.
He is known to have bilateral high-grade stenoses.
On the day of admission he underwent elective stenting and he was doing well.
However, during the procedure it was noted acutely that he was not moving his right hand and face well and that he had difficulty responding to questions, and he became progressively less verbal, although he was still alert.
Angiogram was done emergently, which revealed likely occlusion of the left angular branch of the middle cerebral artery on the left, but because the patient could not tolerate the placement of the catheter, he could not receive intra-arterial TPA.
He was started Reapro and Heparin and transferred to the PACU.
At the time that he was seen in the neurological ICU he was on a Integrilin 3 ml per hour, Heparin, Zantac, Labetalol p.r.n.
He initially tolerated the Heparin and Integrilin well, but on the day after admission it was noted that his hematocrit had dropped to 30 from a preoperative level of 37.
The Heparin and Reapro were held.
He was given two units of packed red blood cells and the hematocrit came up nicely.
While he was in the unit, he also received some Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure support.
Following the discontinuation of the Integrilin and Heparin, he was started on Aspirin and Plavix.
He was also seen by PT and Occupational Therapy who felt that he would do well with three to five outpatient visits per week for continued rehabilitation of the right upper extremity.
Bedside swallow test was performed, which demonstrated that he could swallow thickened liquids and diet was advanced as tolerated with no adverse events.
Aspirin at 325 mg p.o.q.d.
Plavix 75 mg p.o.q.d.
OTHER MEDICATIONS:  Other medications will be included in the discharge addendum.
