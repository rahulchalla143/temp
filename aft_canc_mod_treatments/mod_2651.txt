Admission Date:  [**2175-6-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2175-7-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-11-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central line placement (right IJ)   History of Present Illness: 72 year-old female with past medical hx of Lung CA s/p lobectomy, CHF, presented from OSH w/resp distress.
She was found at home in the morning of admission sitting on the couch, short of breath, right-sided "slouching", hypertensive to 225/110, tachycardic to 110-120s, unresponsive, incontinent of urine/stool.
At OSH was saturating 70% on 12L NC and so was intubated.
She receiving rocephin, lasix, bumex, lactulose, neomycin.
Also received succinylcholine, fentanyl, and versed peri-intubation.
* In our ED, she received lasix 60 IV x1 with minimal response, placed on propofol, and had a CT of her abdomen due to a distended abdomen.
Lung CA s/p lobectomy 2.
Brief Hospital Course: ICU Course: Active problems on admssion included 1)hypercarbic respiratory failure, 2)oliguric acute renal failure, 3)large liver mass seen on the abdominal CT, 4)intermittent supraventricular tachycardia, 5)Hypotension.
In terms of respiratory failure, pt was intubated and was treated for pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, and +/-CHF.
She was started on Vanc/Levo/Flagyl for empiric coverage.
She was initially given Lasix 100 mg IV for a concern for CHF from pulmonary edema seen on CXR but was later thought unlikely since her CVP was only 10.
She was also started on steroids for COPD exacerbation.
She was started on Diltiazem and has been adequately rate controlled.
Pt got Albuterol/fluticasone and a very short course of steroid taper for the possible COPD exacerbation.
She also developed hypernatremia which was corrected with IV D5W to correct the free water deficit.
She was continued on Calcitriol and Sevelamer.
Her Epogen dose was increased to 5000 unit qMWF from 3000 unit.
Her delirium was thought likely from toxic metabolic etiology secondary to combination of hypothyroid, ICU delirium, steroid use, hypernatremia, and acute infection.
She was initially kept NPO due to aspiration risk from mental status change.
She initially required frequent PRN Haldol and Zydis for agitation.
4)Hypertension: She was continued on po metorprol and Hydralazine for BP control.
5)Tacchycardia: Pt had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia, likely AVNRT, in the ICU which was controlled with Diltiazem then was switched to metoprolol.
On the floor, she again had an episode of SVT for 1 hr which was finally broke with IV Diltiazem.
Her EKG and rhythm strips were reviewed by the EP team who recommended medical management at this time with a beta-blocker.
If she continues to have AVNRT despite maximal medical treatment, elective ablation should be considered.
Her synthroid dose was increased to 50 mcg qd.
