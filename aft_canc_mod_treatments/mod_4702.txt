He was subsequently found to have NSCLC with metastases to the adrenals.He was admitted to the MICU on [**2168-8-15**] and required angiography w/ embolization for a lung parenchyma bleed.
He had a course of radiation therapy finishing on [**2168-9-6**] and 4 cycles of chemotherapy finishing on [**2168-12-1**].
The interventional pulmunology team placed a pigtail catheter and drain 2 liters from the right lung cavity.
Family History: Father with NHL, died age 47  Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: Vitals: T:96.8 BP:132/79 P:106 R:30 18 O2:97 on 6 L nc General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress, appears cachetic HEENT: Sclera anicteric, tongue with white plaque Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation on left side,no breath sounds and increased dullness to percussion on the right until middle of lung.
[**2-7**] LENI: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins demonstrate normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation.
Pleural Fluid cytology showed rare atypical epithelioid cells with enlarged nuclei and prominent nucleoli, too few to characterize.
The atypical cells seen on ThinPrep are not seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 62yo male with metastatic NSCLC s/p XRT and chemotherapy, previous MICU admission [**7-/2168**] requiring embolization for lung parenchymal bleed, recurrent hemoptysis, who presented with increased ankle edema, productive cough, orthopnea, and dyspnea, as well as worsening LLE pain.
Work-up revealed large right pleural effusion, which was drained after pigtail catheter placement.
Course c/b by aspiration event, hypercarbic respiratory failure and acidemia requiring intubation, hypotension in setting of probable sepsis and cardiac tamponade, s/p pericardiocentesis.
# Shock: Multifactorial etiology, though continued shock was most likely secondary to septic shock.
180cc pericardial fluid drained on [**2169-2-7**] and  follow up echo on [**2169-7-11**] show very small pericardial effusion remaining.
A restrictive cardiogenic process was considered, given hyperdynamic heart and preload dependence.
Patient treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and aggressive volume resuscitation.
Was gradually weaned off levophed, but remained on vasopressin for BP support.
He acutely worsened overnight [**Date range (1) 85787**] and would have required re-initation of pressors.
A discussion was held with the family and the decision was made to make him comfort care and he was terminally extubated.
A scopolamine patch was applied and a morphine drip was started.
Respiratory Distress:  Initial dyspnea and hypoxia were most likely secondary to right pleural effusion, and patient had significant improvement in dyspnea following drainage of about 2L exudative effusion via pigtail catheter placement.
Patient urgently intubated, and antibiotics broadened from vanc/unasyn to vanc/zosyn.
Patient continued on broad spectrum antibiotics, with regimen later broadened to include cipro for pseudomonas double coverage as patient was continuing to spike fevers and WBC was trending up.
Patient also became volume overloaded and developed pulmonary edema in setting of aggressive IVF administration for shock (see below).
Patient had cosyntropin stim test, without appropriate response.
Was started on hydrocortisone 50mg IV Q6H, and dose later increased to 100mg IV Q6H given patient not improving.
Patient was eventually made comfort measures only and was terminally extubated and he expired.
Plain radiographs of left hip obtained and will need MRI for further workup.
Patient initially started on morphine PCA for pain control, was switched to fentanyl gtt/bolus as needed for pain.
A morphine drip was started when he was made cmo.
Required levophed and vasopressin support.
Corrected with fluid administration.
Pt s/p palliative XRT and chemotherapy.
Given all of his underlying tumor burden and his worsening clinicial condition, his family decided to start comfort measures and he was terminally extubated.
