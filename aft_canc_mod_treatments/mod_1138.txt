Patient states for the last 4 months, he has been having diarrhea with PO intake and abdominal bloating.

Today he took Lovenox to begin his bridge.
Two 16 guage IV's were placed and the patient was empirically started on a pantoprazole gtt as well as given octreotide.
which did not show diverticulitis per se, but given his associated fevers he was empirically started on ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.
The case was discussed with hepatology who recommended empiric abx's without reversal of anticoagulation given history of hypercoaguable state, with plan for flex sig in the AM vs colonoscopy on Monday.

Cirrhosis, splenomegaly, ascites, and numerous portosystemic varies are unchanged from MRCP [**2122-6-18**].
ERCP Report: Impression: Evidence of previous sphincterotomy was noted Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a balloon catheter using a free-hand technique A narrowing was noted in mid CBD consistent with a stricture.
Small filling defects were noted in the distal CBD consistent with stone/sludge Multiple balloon sweeps were performed and moderate amounts of stone fragments and sludge were extracted successfully.
Cytology samples were obtained for histology using a brush in the biliary stricture.
A 6cm by 10FR Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed successfullyOtherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum  Recommendations: Return to hospital floor Await cytology results.
Repeat ERCP in 2 months for stent removal and inspection  Additional notes: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the GI fellow.
Medium non-bleeding grade 3 internal & external hemorrhoids with skin tags were noted.
Other Rectal varices were seen extending 12cm from the anal verge.
He was treated initially with zosyn and defervesced quickly, was changed to cipro/flagyl 2 days prior to discharge without fevers.
When his INR downtrended he went to ERCP with retrieval of stones and placement of stent, as well as biliary brushings taken for cytology, with decrease in his LFTs and resolution of his abdominal pain.
He will need follow-up with ERCP in 2 months for stent retrieval and will complete a 10 day course of antibiotics with cipro/flagyl as an outpatient for cholangitis.
# LGI bleed - initially placed on octreotide/pantoprazole drips due to history of GI bleeding and known varices.
# Antiphospholipid Syndrome - pt w history of APS causing portal vein thrombosis, on coumadin as outpatient; in setting of GI bleed, coumadin was held and his INR was left to drift down.
On the last day of discharge he was restarted on coumadin at half the home dose due to interaction with flagyl.
He will bridge with lovenox 80 [**Hospital1 **] till therapeutic.
The lovenox bridge and reduced coumadin dose were discussed with his outpatient coumadin RN.
He will have labs drawn on [**6-29**] with results faxed to the liver center, his hematologist and his coumadin RN.
# Choledocholithiasis: continued on ursodiol  # Chronic Anemia: iron restarted  # Pancreatic insufficiency: continued on pancreatic enzymes  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ================================================================ Transitional issues: - Microcytic anemia: pt will be discharged on iron supplementation.
- Post-ERCP: pt will need f/u with ERCP in 2 months for stent removal.
- INR monitoring: currently discharged on half of home dose coumadin due to interaction with flagyl and lovenox bridge.
Will be on flagyl for 6 more days after discharge.
