He was given lasix 80 mg IV and nitroglycerin spray.
Initially he was placed on CPAP with nitroglycerin.
His BP decreased and nitro drip was stopped.
Dopamine was started but then transitioned to levophed as patient was tachycardic.
Additionally, he had complaints of abdominal pain and possible distension and was given morphine with episodes of pain which helped with the respiratory distress as well.
For hyperkalemia, he was given calcium gluconate.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 227**] that the patient had a new LBBB, he was started on heparin IV for possible ACS and patient was transferred for possible catherization.
Prior to transfer patient was apparently placed on peripheral levophed and non-rebreather prior to transfer.
He was immediately placed on CPAP and restrained.

?Hypertension  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1. s/p vertebroplasty L4-5 2. s/p scalp cancer resection [**7-11**] 3. s/p femoral stenting (right superificial femoral)[**6-8**] 4. s/p TURP [**4-9**] 5. s/p Appendectomy [**8-7**]   Social History: Mr. [**Known lastname **] lives with his wife at [**Location (un) **] ([**Hospital3 **]).
He has a remote history of 3-pack per day cigarette smoking, having stopped over 50 years ago, and is a rare social drinker.
NGT with side port at the gastroesophageal junction.
He was also given Lasix IV x1 in the ED and had good UOP response to it.
For the pneumonia, he was treated with levaquin, in addition to flagyl (given the possibility of aspiration).
He had copious secretions, requiring aggresive suctioning and chest PT in the CCU.
He improved over the first 48 hours without requiring intubation and his oxygen requirement steadily decreased.
He received chest PT to help with his secretions as well as an incentive spirometer.
He remained afebrile on antibiotics without white count.
He also had evidence of bronchospasm on exam, likely from the pneumonia, and was treated with albuterol and atrovent nebulizers which were changed to MDIs prior to discharge.
A KUB initally confirmed concern for SBO, and general surgery were consulted.
Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Initially, beta-blocker was held as the patient was NPO with a well controlled rate.
As he began to take PO, beta-blocker was restarted at the home dose (and later titrated up from 25mg daily to 50mg daily).
He presented on coumadin, which was held given an initially supratherapeutic INR (3.1, 3.8, 4.0).
Etiologies for the elevated INR included medication interaction (given levofloxacin/flagyl), decreased gut bacteria in the setting of antibiotics and poor PO given that the patient was initially NPO.
He was given 2mg of SC vitamin K and his INR decreased to 2.2.
Coumadin was restarted [**3-29**] and INR remained subtherapeutic at 1.7.
However, he was not given additional coumadin above home dose as he was continuing on flagyl which can inhibit coumadin metabolism.
He did not present on aspirin; PR aspirin was used while NPO, transitioned to PO.
Pump: Clinical exam initially consistent with left sided heart failure and has some improvement after aggressive diuresis.
Responded well to a one time dose of IV Lasix and did not require further diuresis once his BP was controlled.
Altered mental status: Was initially delirius in setting of sedating meds and infection.
Has been treated with hydroxyurea - continued during this admission with normal platelet levels.
Ferritin was elevated with a normal iron and low TIBC; could be partly due to anemia of inflammation.
