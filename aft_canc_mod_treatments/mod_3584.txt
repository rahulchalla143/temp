Admission Date: [**2110-2-28**]        Discharge Date: [**2110-4-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2036-5-26**]        Sex:  M  Service:HEPATOBILIARY SURGERY SERVICE   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 53382**] is a 73 year old male with a history of cholangiocarcinoma who is status post left hepatic lobectomy, cholecystectomy, common duct excision and pylorosparing Whipple procedure on [**2112-1-11**] who was discharged on [**2110-2-5**] and was subsequently readmitted on [**2110-2-10**] with a collection of a subphrenic abscess.
His PTC drain had had minimal output and his [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drain had had a large amount of output which was reddish brown in color.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Is significant for left hepatic lobectomy, a pylorosparing Whipple procedure, and multiple excisions of skin cancer.
The patient was admitted to the hospital for intravenous fluid hydration, consultation with the nephrology service, elevation of his legs, antibiotics, strict I's and O's and follow up of his liver function tests.
The ultrasound revealed that patient was status post hepatectomy and no focal lesions were identified in the rest of the liver.
On [**2110-3-2**] he was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.
He was continued on intravenous fluids and a HIT panel was checked.
At that time they thought that there was no consideration for plastic surgical intervention.
They doubt that the lesion on his anterior temporoparietal area on the right with serous drainage was suitable for any type of debridement at that time.
The biliary tree appeared decompressed and there was rapid flow through the biliary drainage catheter entering the jejunum.
His PTC catheter had about 20 cc drainage per day.
Given his suboptimal fluid status at that time and his hypovolemia, the patient was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at which time a Swan Ganz catheter was placed.
On [**2110-3-5**] a radial arterial line was also placed.
The patient was started on acyclovir.
He was again transfused a unit of packed cells on [**2110-3-6**].
His antibiotics at that time consisted of Levaquin, linezolid and acyclovir.
The patient through the next several days demonstrated septic physiology and required fresh frozen plasma and platelet products.
He also required Levophed drip for blood pressure support in light of his septic physiology.
At this point he was started on Lasix and which did allow us to diurese him to some small amount.
At this time he was also started on CCVHD.
On [**2110-3-9**] an arterial line was placed without complication.
At this time he was continued on antibiotics and CCVHD for his renal failure.
It was agreed at that point that we would continue aggressive therapy include CCVHD, high dose acyclovir and intubation if necessary.
Also on [**2110-3-10**] a right internal jugular line was placed without complication.
In the evening of that day the patient was intubated for respiratory distress.
The patient was on Levophed as well as propofol for sedation and was being ventilated in assist control mode.
He was started on amiodarone.
Cardioversion was attempted but the patient did not convert.
A right subclavian line was placed on the 8th without complication.
The patient was continued on CCVHD throughout this time.
A successful placement of a new #10 French modified nephrostomy tube was completed.
Patient was started on Argatroban at that time as well.
Patient continued to be resuscitated with fresh frozen plasma and platelets throughout his hospital course.
He was maintained on total parenteral nutrition throughout his hospitalization.
When the patient's amiodarone was discontinued he did recur into rapid atrial fibrillation.
He also continued to require total parenteral nutrition.
On [**2110-3-27**] a repeat ultrasound was done due to his biliary drainage which had decreased output and continuously rising bilirubin.
The patient remained on fluconazole, Vancomycin and Zosyn at this time.
His antibiotics were on the 24th Zosyn, Vancomycin and fluconazole.
For the details of that procedure please see the dictated operative note.
He had increased coagulopathy and was requiring fresh frozen plasma.
He was febrile and continued to require ventilatory support on these first few days of [**Month (only) 116**].
He was continued on pressors including Levophed and Pitressin.
He was continued on total parenteral nutrition at that time.
Failure to thrive requiring total parenteral    nutrition.
