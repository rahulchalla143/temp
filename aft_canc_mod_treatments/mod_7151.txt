She was started on clinda and xferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
In the ED she received a dose of cefepime and she was admitted to OMED.
Excisional biopsy of left supraclavicular node pathology and immunohistochemistry c/w CLL.
Pt was asympt & deferred Tx until F/sweats in [**1-17**] & Tx was started w/fludarabine ([**2164-1-24**]).
However her chemotherapy course was complicated by febrile neutropenia.
Her post-chemotherapy course was complicated by febrile neutropenia and pancytopenia.
Her bone marrow was again assessed in [**8-/2162**] and was consistent with treated CLL.
She remained thrombocytopenic following this without a response to steroids and only minimal response to IVIG.
Bone marrow biopsy on [**10/2164**] suggested a sustained response to chemotherapy on the megakaryocytes.
Due to increasing painful lymphadenopathy and IVC compression seen on CT, she was treated with chlorambucil from [**2166-2-24**] through [**2166-4-3**].
Chlorambucil was restarted at 4mg dose on [**2166-8-29**] when she progressed with painful adenopathy.
This was given concurrently with prednisone to treat ITP.
The chlorambucil was discontinued on [**2166-10-2**].

ORL service noted narrowing in upper airway and edema which would make emergant intubation difficult.
Given relatively new airway compromise and affect on treatment recommendations particularly by radiation oncology for treatment dose and potential response, concern raised for transformation of CCL.
Bone marrow biopsy done ([**1-13**]) to re-evaluate etiology of thrombocytopenia in preparation for chemotherapy decision-making.
Dexamethasone 40mg was given when airway compromise first suspected and tumor lysis labs monitored.
She was electively intubated and sedated for airway protection in preparation for LN biopsy and subsequent planned radiation (to protect against radiation induced edema and need for urgent intubation).
She received radiation treatments on [**1-15**] and [**1-16**], and had daily cuff leaks checked.
Swelling from radiation did reach the point that on the morning of [**1-17**] she had no cuff leak; this resolved over time while getting further radiation ([**1-18**] and throughout remainder of hospitalization).
When transferred back to the oncology service, she was still complaining of some difficulty breathing, had severe thrush, had an NG tube in place, and her sodium was 149.
Her Nystatin S/S was changed to fluconazole 7 day course (completed with significant improvement).
She continued to receive daily XRT to the throat and neck, and remained on a slow steroid taper to control her swelling (10mg daily at time of d/c).
Her oropharyngeal and neck edema continued to improve.
Patient initially placed on Cefepime for febrile neutropenia while cultures were made available.
Patient noted to have history of agranulocytosis with beta-lactams; antibiotic regimen changed for levaquin and clindamycin for 14 day course.
However, on [**1-19**] she developed fevers while on the vent, up to 101.3, and was treated for VAP based on gram stain showing GPCs.
We continued treating with vanco, levo, flagyl (a second-line approach because of her beta-lactam allergy) with a planned 7 day course for VAP.
We considered using meropenem, but given her allergy history this was deferred.
Foley catheter removed and pt followed off antibiotics for symptoms and evidence of fever.
#) Hypertension: Patient had history of malignant hypertension in prior admissions with symptoms of headache and epigastric / left sided chest pain.
Patient experienced new episode during this hospitalization after discontinuation of lisinopril after this was held for worsening renal insufficiency, in spite of addition of hydralazine PO PRN for SBP > 160 and Q4H vital signs.
Her pressures became elevated during the latter part of her MICU stay but she was having great difficulty with swallowing, so she was put on IV metoprolol and hydralazine to control pressures as needed; she was also started on a clonidine patch.
She was gradually transitioned back to her extensive home antihypertensive regimen on the floor, with the substitution and uptitration of carvedilol for beta blockade .
Cardiology was consulted and agreed with rate control management alone, so her beta blocker was uptitrated to carvedilol 37.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
On the floor, with aggressive rehydration for hypernatremia (max was 151), her creatinine decreased to baseline.
#) Throat pain: After extubation she complained of debilitating throat pain, which made PO medicines very difficult.
As mentioned above, she completed a course of fluconazole for thrush, which was markedly improved by discharge.
Of note, her LFTs did bump during this treatment, likely as a medication side effect.
Restarted at time of discharge, and outpatient management deferred to primary heme/onc team.
Aspirin therapy was considered but not given due to thrombocytopenia.
Medical CAD regimen included BB, ACE-I, and nitrate  #) DM: fixed dose (glargine 9 units [**Hospital1 **]) and sliding scale insulin while in house.

This worked quite well and your obstruction quickly resolved.
You were exxtubated without problem and will continue to receieve radiation as an outpatient.
You briefly needed a nasogastric tube to help you eat since the swelling in your mouth was so bad, but once it improved, our speech and swallow team decided that you could eat safely on your own.
While intubated in our ICU, you developed a fever and completed a course of antibiotics for a presumed pneumonia.
You also finished a course of fluconazole, an antifungal drug, for some thrush that you developed in your mouth, likely from your steroid medication.
We removed the line and applied warm compresses to the area.
We called our cardiologists and they recommended management with a beta blocker called carvedilol, which you should take as prescribed.
Please take all of your medicines as prescribed.
