The right internal jugular line ends in the mid superior vena cava.
CLOSTRIDIUM SPECIES NOT C. PERFRINGENS OR C. SEPTICUM.
Became acutely SOB requiring intubation in the ED, likely due to metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation leading to fatigue.
Ischemia was considered given report of chest pain, although EKG negative and cardiac markers negative.
Pt was stable on pressure support on the vent and sedation was weaned.
She was diuresed with lasix and repeated almost daily SBTs continued to show elevated RR and tachycardia.
She was quickly weaned down to 2L NC with O2 sats 95-100%.
Of note, RSBI is not likely a good indication of this patients suitability for extubation given her baseline tachypnea and small TV and as she did very well s/p extubation with a pre-extubation RSBI of 156. .

On [**11-30**], diltiazem was discontinued and metoprolol was uptitrated.
She was rescuscitated with D5 1/2 NS with 3 amps of bicarb followed by NS PRN to maintain CVP > 10.
FEN: Pt was initially kept NPO then provided with full fibersource tube feeds at 30 ml/hr.
In anticipation of extubation and question of whether she would be able to pass speech and swallow immediately, her OG tube was changed to an NG tube on [**11-27**].
The remainder of her blood pressure medications from home were held and should be re-added as an outpatient.
