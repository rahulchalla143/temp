He received meropenem and micafungin.
Denies constipation, abdominal pain, melena, hematemesis, hematochezia.
Cytogenetics showed the presence of BCR-ABL gene rearrangement in 90/100 cells.
He was also started on Gleevec.
During his nadir on [**2132-3-29**] he spiked a fever and was started on Cefepime and vancomycin.
An echo showed no signs of vegetation, and a replacement PICC was placed after 48 hours of remaining afebrile.
Several days later he spiked fevers again and was noted to have infiltrates on CT suggestive of multi-focal pneumonia, a subsequent bronch with BAL demonstrated MRSA.
He was discharged home on [**2132-4-18**] with his PICC line to continue IV vancomycin for 3 weeks (end [**5-1**]).
The rash was thought to be due either to nifedipine, which was started during his prior admission for hypertension, or vancomycin, although this was thought to be less likely because he did not havedesquamation.
He was subsequently discharged on [**2132-5-7**] after receiving IV fluids and starting on a course of po linezolid.
He was admitted for his transplant on [**2132-7-3**], day 0 was [**2132-7-9**].
His post-transplant course has been complicated by MRSA bacteremia, acute kidney injury d/t tacrolimus toxicity (was accidentally given 10 mg of tacro versus 1 mg), urinary BK virus, and CMV viremia requiring therapy with Foscarnet.
A sphincterotomy was performed with extraction of sludge, stone fragments, and a small amount of pus.His total bilirubin was elevated to 10.3 several days s/p ERCP with stenting.
He was started on steroids for GVHD and his total bili had decreased to 2.5 upondischarge on [**2132-10-26**].
In [**2132-11-1**], pulmonary nodules noted on CT scan, and aspergillus in sputum.
In [**Month (only) **], patient was readmitted with right leg mucor infection.
At which point, he started treatment with ambisome and micafungin, which were continued as an outpatient, with treatment course complicated by PICC line thrombus.

Also improved since the previous study are a 6-mm wide fluid filled cavity in the superior segment of the right lower lobe that was 8 mm in [**Month (only) **] and an 8-mm wide cavity in the right middle lobe that was at least 16 mm.
Would recommend serial chest radiographs until resolved.
There is also near-complete opacification of the ethmoidal cells as well as concentric mucosal thickening of the left frontal sinus.
IMPRESSION: Air-fluid levels in maxillary and sphenoid sinuses with nearly complete opacification of ethmoidal cells consistent with acute sinusitis.
No abnormal parenchymal, vascular, or meningeal enhancement seen following gadolinium administration.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were 507 automated spike detections predominantly for electrode and movement artifact but some entries were also for the epileptiform discharges in the bifrontal and right frontocentral regions.

You were admitted with malaise and fevers, and were found to have pneumonia from respiratory syncytial virus.
You had a prolonged course of pneumonia, but improved with intravenous immunoglobulin and palivizumab (a specific antibody for respiratory syncytial virus).
We believe your seizures were due to your bad pneumonia, along with medications that can predispose you to seizures.
Please note, the following changes were made to your medications: # START Keppra (levetiracetam) 500 mg by mouth twice daily # INCREASE prednisone to 20 mg by mouth daily # STOP cefpodoxime # STOP tacrolimus # STOP enoxaparin  Please continue all of your other medications as you had prior to your hospitalization.
