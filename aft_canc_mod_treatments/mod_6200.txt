Right common femoral to anterior tibial artery bypass     with non-reversed greater saphenous vein.
Angioscopy and valve lysis.
TOTAL FLUOROSCOPY TIME:  2.9 minutes.
He had previously undergone a right femoral patch angioplasty and subsequently right femoral to below-knee popliteal pro patent bypass graft.
Given these findings, the patient was consented for a arteriogram, possible bypass graft nerve to achieve limb salvage.
General endotracheal anesthesia was started.
Vancomycin and gentamicin was given intravenously prior to skin incision.
Previously performed femoral to popliteal bypass graft on the left was seen and puncture was made above the anastomosis of bypass graft micro sheath.
Micro sheath was used to access the left external iliac artery and followed by [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7648**] wire in abdominal aorta and a 4-French short sheath in the left external iliac artery and Omni Flush catheter in abdominal aorta.
Contralateral second-order catheterization of the right external iliac artery was achieved with a combination of angled Glidewire and Omni Flush catheters.
Dissection was carried down using electrocautery and saphenous vein was identified by sharp dissection.
The entire length of saphenous vein appeared to be quite usable and appeared quite healthy.
Vessel loops were used to control the common femoral artery, the superficial femoral, the profunda femoris artery, and the circumflex femoral vessels.
Next, exploration of the proximal anterior tibial artery was achieved via a longitudinal skin incision the lateral aspect of the leg.
Dissection was carried down using electrocautery and the anterior tibial artery is identified and all side branches of the anterior tibial artery were carefully controlled with 2-0 silk ties and proximal and distal control was controlled with vessel loops on the anterior tibial artery.
Once we had proximal distal control in our inflow and outflow vessels, heparin 6000 units was given intravenously to maintain activated clotting time for 20-50 seconds throughout the entire case.
Saphenous vein was removed and an angioscopy with valve lysis was performed with a [**Doctor Last Name 4048**] valvulotome.
Proximal and distal clamps were released and flushing of the graft was performed.
The graft was matched to the anterior tibial artery in end-to-side anastomosis of a spatulated vein and the longitudinal anterior tibial arteriotomy was performed with two running 6- 0 Prolene sutures.
Backflushing and fore flushing of four vessels were performed prior to completion of the anastomosis.
The vein graft is seen coming off the proximal aspect of     the left common femoral artery.
The pro patent graft is seen coming off the proximal     portion of the medial portion of the common femoral     artery and appeared to be patent in its proximal stump.
______________________________________________________   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 66-year-old man experienced previously rest pain in his right foot and  had undergone surgery for  a right femoral patch angioplasty and subsequently right femoral to below-knee popliteal pro patent bypass graft at [**Hospital3 **]([**2182-8-23**]).
He presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] with continued rest pain and evidence of limb threat with sensory loss in the right foot.The patient was consented for a arteriogram and possible bypass graft nerve to achieve limb salvage.
General endotracheal anesthesia was started.
Vancomycin and gentamicin were given intravenously prior to skin incision.
Right common femoral to anterior tibial artery bypass     with non-reversed greater saphenous vein.
Angioscopy and valve lysis.
His hematocrit  which has been in the high 20s after surgery dropped to 23/24%.
The patient received 2 units of RBC with a good response.
The patient was weaned and extubated after colonoscopy.
Some purulent discharge and cellulitis was noted over his RLE distal wound.
Wound cultures were sent and the patient was subsequently put on Vancomycin Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl.
His antibiotic regiment was switched to Augmentin.
