His workup started on [**6-10**], after his PCP ordered [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CXR for chronic cough, weight loss, chest burning and dyspnea.
On [**7-2**], the patient re-presented with ongoing dry cough, chest pain, dyspnea, weight loss, and swelling of his left arm, neck and face.
He was taken to the cath lab for urgent pericardiocentesis and drain placement.
Pericardial fluid grew gram positive cocci, and vancomycin was started.
The drain was pulled, and the patient subsequently underwent pericardial window placement and bilateral chest tube placement by thoracics in the OR yesterday.
Following the procedures, he self-extubated and was weaned off pressors entirely.
Prior to transfer today, he had a PICC line placed.
Vancomycin was discontinued after his pericardial fluid grew out coagulase negative staph.
The patient has not been given IV fluid boluses given SVC syndrome, but is taking consistent oral intake.
Oncology has been consulted and has been planning on starting chemotherapy with etoposide and carboplatin when the patient is hemodynamically stable.

Large left hilar/mediastinal necrotic nodal conglomerate (6.1 x 5 cm) markedly attenuates the left main pulmonary artery.
Drainage overnight with repeat echocardiogram tomorrow morning.
[**7-4**] CXR: In comparison with the next preceding portable chest examination of [**2176-6-17**], the patient is now intubated and has bilateral chest tubes as described without evidence of pneumothorax.
Tiny loculated left basilar pneumothorax with left chest tube in place, which has a partially intrafissural location.
Subsequently he developed bilateral pleural effusions, a left pneumothorax, had 3 chest tubes placed and then developed a RLL pneumonia.
# Pericardial Effusion sp Drain Placement: malignant, recent lung carcinoma diagnosis.
He had a pericardiocentesis which was successful, with drain placement.
s/p pericardial window [**7-4**], but [**7-29**] TTE showed reaccumulation of moderate effusion, which is loculated,  likely not draining through window, per thoracics, no further intervention.
# SVC syndrome: Chest imaging concerning for near-total attenuation of SVC by mass.
Ultimately, there was no place for access, and an abdominal port was placed by surgery.
# Pleural effusions: Bilateral, malignant effusions [**2-7**] recent lung cancer diagnosis.
The tubes continued to drain copious fluid so each pleural space was pleurodesed 2 times, first with doxycycline and then with talc.
Pt to have appt on [**2176-8-13**] w/ Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in IP, with chest tube sutures to be removed.
# Lung Mass: Mixed small cell / non-small cell lung Ca pt initiated chemotherapy ([**Doctor Last Name **]/Etoposide) on [**2176-7-6**] in hopes that this would help not only his cancer, but also treat his malignant effusions.
Radiation therapy will be readdressed in the outpt setting.
W/u revealed a RLL pneumonia for which he was started on Vanc and Cefepime.
He completed an 8 day course of vancomycin and cefepime for HAP.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **], You were admitted to the hospital with a cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, weight loss, and swelling in your arms and face.
You still have a tube in place to drain your left lung, and we have arranged for a nurse to visit you at home to help with this.
You started receiving chemotherapy for your lung cancer while you were here.
You now have a port in your abdomen for the chemotherapy.
You were not previously taking any medications at home.
We started the following medications: - Dilaudid as needed for pain (never drive, drink alcohol, or operate heavy machinery with this medication) - Senna and Colace as needed for constipation - Ondansetron as needed for nausea - Metoprolol to control your heart rate .
