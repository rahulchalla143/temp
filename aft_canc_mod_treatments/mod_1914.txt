She also had a chest CT which showed marked progression of disease with a large mass invading the right aspect of the mediastinal with significant narrowing of the distal trachea (and possible invasion), encasement of the lateral aspect of the SVC, esophagus, and right SC vessels, as well as evidence of lymphagitic spread within the lungs.
She received dexamethasone 10 mg IV X 1 and was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring to ensure airway stability prior to planned bronchoscopy/tracheal stenting in a.m.
In [**Location 31038**] rigid bronch [**2-13**] vertebral issues, and no flex bronch-trach stent given nickel allergy(stent is nickel), therefore had balloon dilatation.
Ortho-spine following---recommended brace, intervention only if neuro changes, no signs cord compression now.

She had balloon dilation of her trachea, but flexible and rigid bronchoscopy with stenting could not be performed.
Rigid could not be performed [**2-13**] spinal disease, and flexible could not be performed [**2-13**] nickel allergy to stent that would be used.
Radiation oncology was consulted for possible radiation of the trachea for the narrowing.
She was then put on a morphine drip with the dose titrated up as necessary.
Scolopamine patch was also used.
