Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
If your wound was closed with staples or non-dissolvable sutures then you must wait until after they are removed to wash your hair.
We generally recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) & Senna while taking narcotic pain medication.
Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and Ibuprofen etc.
If you have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam), you will not require blood work monitoring.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
Make sure to continue to use your incentive spirometer while at home.
Please return to the office in [**8-21**] days (from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
Please call if you need to change your appointment, or require additional directions.
