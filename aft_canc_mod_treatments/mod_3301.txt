Admission Date:  [**2135-8-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-9-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2066-11-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vidaza / vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 38616**] Chief Complaint: Admitted electively for chemotherapy for MDS in transformation to AML  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac cath thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: Patient is admitted for Cycle 2 of Decitabine.
He received 0.4 SL Nitro x 3 and 10 mg IV morphine with some resolution.
No stent was placed in order to minimize the risk of interruption of chemotherapy.
His CP was attributed to demand ischemia and troponin peaked at 0.07 before trending down.
He was already on Vancomycin, Cefepime, Fluconazole and Acyclovir at time of transfer to the CCU (Vanc and Cefepime added just prior to cath).
Vancomycin was changed to Daptomycin today given concern for allergy.
Past Medical History: MDS RAEB type 1, 7% blasts with extensive myelofibrosis, 7q-, transfusion dependent, s/p azacitadine complicated by ischemic bowel perforation and multiple ulcers (pyoderma gangrenosum).
Right colectomy [**9-/2134**], for ischemic bowel with slow healing midline abdominal wound.
Demand ischemia with 70% stenosis of RCA on cath [**9-5**], elected to treat with medical therapy alone   Social History: Retired, used to work for a chemical company.
Skin: warm, dry, two right sided abdominal ulcers that are pink and perfused well, appear to be healing and uninfected, unstageable sacral decub Extremities: without cyanosis, without clubbing, mild bilateral LE edema, without joint swelling Neurologic: -mental status: Alert, oriented x 3.

3) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial hypotension, with a central aortic pressure of 80/38 mmHg.
4) Given the patient's acute leukemia, thrombocytopenia, and plan to continue with chemotherapy in the setting of being chest pain-free, we opted to treat the RCA stenosis medically for now until we have a detailed discussion with the oncology team.
Several prolonged and complicated hospital admissions in last 3 months following his first cycle of Decitabine as noted above in HPI.
He is admitted for his second full cycle of chemotherapy with Decitabine today with the plan to use a 10 day regimen.
He required near daily transfusions with platelets and pRBC and failed to increase counts appropriately.
Given poor performance status, significant medical comorbidities including obtundation, virulent drug resistant pneumonia, and ARF, and the patient's goals of care, the patient was made CMO before his death a few days later.
Pt then completed abx course of greater than 2 weeks with linezolid and cefepime.
Pt started on linezolid, meropenem, and acyclovir.
Blood cultures were negative, but sputum culture came back positive for pan-resistant (except Amikacin) pseudomonal pneumonia.
The pt's decline in mental status was most likely  [**1-19**] to sepsis and uremia from ARF which may have been precipitated by sepsis as well as IV acyclovir.
EKG showed ST depressions in V4-V5 that resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin and morphine.
The decision was made not to place a stent due to ongoing chemotherapy and his likely need for further platelet transfusions.
Stent placement would require the initiation of anti-platelet therapy in order to maintain stent patency.
Medical management was started with atorvastatin 20mg not the usual 80mg due to medication interactions and low dose metoprolol.
Pt was continued on low dose statin and metoprolol.
Did not start aspirin given platelets and risk of bleeding.
Pt had hypercalcemia which improved with fluids and pamidronate x 1.
Pt had low PTH, Vitamin D, Calcitriol, and PTHrP.
Pt's hypokal and hypomag were aggressively repleted with termination of premature ventricular beats.
