Please note, this lesion has been characterized on prior MRI Abdomen.
[**2105-1-12**] LENI FINDINGS: Grayscale, color and Doppler images were obtained of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal and tibial veins.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum Recommendations: Hemorrhagic appearing gastric body polyps likely source of melena.
Will discuss need for endoscopic resection given recurrent bleeding.
Single-piece polypectomies were performed using a hot snare in the stomach body.
He was transfused a total of 7 U PRBCs, 3 [**Location 61464**], and received Vitamin K IV and PO.
General surgery and GI teams were consulted for further management.
Derangement was believed to be hypovolemic hypernatremia, as he was made NPO and lacked access to free water.
The patient was started on a slow infusion of D5W to correct the metabolic abnormlity.
*General Wards Course [**Date range (1) 103906**]* # GI bleed: Pt was transferred form the MICU with plans to undergo polypectomy w INR reversal to <1.4.
His coumadin was held on admission and he was given vit K x2 prior to transfer.
On [**1-15**] prior to EGD INR was 1.4 and he was transfused 1u FFP pre-procedure and 2u FFP post-procedurally to encourage hemostasis of polypectomy sites.
EGD showed 4 polyps requiring resection (+ulceration noted).
He was started on carafate slurry x 72 hours post procedure (stopped Sat evening), continued on [**Hospital1 **] pantoprazole 40mg IV, and monitored w Q8 hct levels.
He did not require tranfusion of pRBCs on the general wards.
Anticoagulation was witheld for concern for rebleeding and multiple episodes of GIB on coumadin in recent months.
He was discharged on PO omeprazole 40mg [**Hospital1 **] per GI recs.
Since pt is independent and lives alone, it was decided to send pt for close monitoring for 3-4 days at rehab center and physical therapy services.
Hct level may fluctuate between 28 - 34 depending on lab variability and volume status/po intake.
History of DVT: DVT diagnosed [**2104-11-25**], on coumadin prior to admission for DVT treatment and afib w high CHADS score.
DVT was in setting of recent immobilization after ankle fracture, and patient received approx 7 weeks of anticoagulation.
Discussion was held between PCP and inpatient team and given his recurrent GIB and gastric polyps decision was made to avoid anticoagulation for now.
Decision for aspirin therapy deferred to outpt pending full stability from GIB standpoint in [**3-19**] weeks.
Afib: Currently in paroxysmal afib with long PR, holding anticoagulation as above.
# HL: continued on home statin .
# Urethral irritation: Foley cath was discontinued on [**1-16**] and pt reports some urethral discomfort since it was removed.
Pt is noted to be incontinent of urine at baseline.

You were treated with IV anti-acid medication, carafate (protect the stomach), and blood products to boost blood clotting ability.
We stopped your coumadin since the blood thinning function was causing you to bleed.
It was decided to hold any anticoagulation at this time given your multiple recent bleeding episodes.
- STARTED Omeprazole 40 mg twice a day for acid control and to prevent ulcers from forming - STOPPED Coumadin - STOPPED Enoxaparin .
Your primary care doctor may decide to place you on an aspirin in the future, once your bleeding has completely resolved.
