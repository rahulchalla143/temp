She used approximately 1.5 of the 3 bottles of prep, and since then has had continuous N/V of brown, coffee-grounds emesis.
She is passing flatus; uses laxatives at baseline for constipation.
In the ED she has been started on IVF and has received a dose of Zofran, but is not feeling much better and is continuing to intermittently vomit small amounts of coffee-grounds emesis.

Physical Exam: On admission: Vitals - T:97.4  BP:130/60  HR:92  RR:16  O2sat:100% r/a General: NAD, appears mildly uncomfortable, vomits intermittently CV: RRR Lungs: CTAB Abdomen: faint bowel sounds present, significantly distended, dull to percussion, diffuse discomfort with palpation but no pain, no rebound/guarding Ext: 2+ edema to mid-calf b/l, NT Pelvic deferred in ED.
Again seen are non-dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels.
NG tube with tip overlying the stomach.
[**2117-8-20**] Portable CXR: INDICATION: Respiratory failure post-central line placement.
FINDINGS: Comparison to a radiograph performed five hours prior.
The new right internal jugular central venous catheter is in satisfactory position with the distal tip projected over the lower SVC.
Position of the nasogastric and endotracheal tubes and right-sided peripherally inserted central catheter are unchanged and satisfactory.
IMPRESSION: Satisfactory position of newly inserted right internal jugular catheter with no evidence of pneumothorax.
Satisfactory position of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes and peripherally inserted central venous catheter.
NG tube with its tip overlying the stomach.
[**2117-8-25**] Portabl CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**8-24**] at 6:23 a.m.: Endotracheal tube ends at the thoracic inlet in standard placement.
Left subclavian line tip projects over the mid SVC and nasogastric tube passes to the upper stomach.
Large amount of ascites, demonstrated on prior ultrasound examinations.
Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
Course will be reviewed by system:  # Cardiovascular:  She was continued on her home anti-hypertensives and statin.
She was started on IV lasix which was titrated to her oxygen requirement.
She was given gentle fluids and her creatinine decreased appropriately.
She was re-started on lasix as described above.
# Oncology: She had a paracentesis with removal of 2L of ascites on [**8-10**].
Cytology was inconclusive and she underwent repeat paracentesis on [**8-12**] at which time 4L was removed.
She was given chemotherapy on [**2117-8-17**] at which time she was showing signs of mild volume overload, with trace to 1+ pitting dependent edema.
She was given prophylaxis for and monitored for tumor lysis syndrome and her kidney function remained stable.
She also became significantly volume overloaded in the setting of aggressive hydration with bicarbonate, with portable CXR showing significant pulmonary edema and her clinical exam showing substantial third spacing.
She received albumin on [**8-10**] and [**8-12**].
She failed multiple attempts to wean her to CPAP/PS and thus remained on CMV until she was extubated according to the family's wishes on [**2117-8-30**], made CMO, and started on a morphine drip.
Cardiology deemed that the episodes were likely vagally induced - from common vagal triggers, including suctioning and ventalator manipulation - and recommended against emergent temporary wire in the setting of her longterm prognosis.
# Hypotension / Sepsis / Lactic acidosis: The patient became hypotensive on admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], requiring goal directed therapy, including blood pressure supporting medications and aggressive intravascular repletion with crystalloid and pRBCs.
The patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for concern for sepsis with Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl as well as stress dose steroids in the setting of known low dose steroids for polymyalgia rheumatica.
It was thought that this was due to her intra-abdominal malignancy.
She has been on prednisone for approximately one month since her diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica and is currently tapering.
