Admission Date:  [**2178-1-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-2-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2131-3-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**] Chief Complaint: Weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy Intubation Mechanical Ventilation   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 62558**] is a 46 year-old male with a history of HIV who initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2178-1-13**] with SOB and nonbloody diarrhea and a CD4 count of 19 (pt off HAART for 1.5 year).
Since admission he has been diagnosed with PCP (from BAL [**1-16**] treated with bactrim and steroid taper), Giardia (finished flaygl [**1-23**] with no residual diarrhea), KS with pulmonary involvement(treated with Paclitaxel and high dose steroids on [**1-20**]), thrush, HSV type II (lesion on left chin), and CMV pnuemonitis growing from [**1-16**] BAL, as well as CMV bacteremia (treated with gancyclovir).
He also developed recurrent Hep B infection and therefore was started on HAART therapy [**1-22**] despite active PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2**].
Mr. [**Known lastname 90417**] hospital course is also notable for developing bilateral apical pneumothoraces and is s/p chest tube placement by IP.
The Chest tube has since been pulled [**1-28**] and his bilateral pneumothoraces were stable by radiology report.
He also developed tachypnea and hypoxia and was diagnosed with hospital acquired PNA and was started on vanc/zosyn on [**1-30**].
Per primary team, the pt has been stable on the floor with O2 sats in the high 80s to low 90s on 5 L nc during this hospitalization.
This morning an NGT was placed for nutrition given pt very malnourished and he was noted to be more hypoxic.
He was placed on venturi mask and nasal canula and his sats remained in the mid to low 80s.
Patient was placed on NRB and O2 sas improved to 92%.
In the ICU, patient was placed on nc with nonrebreather on hi Flow.
He was previously on Atripla but  has been off therapy for 1 1/2 years.
Imaging: CXR Wet read right PICC tip in the mid SVC.
CXR [**1-30**] IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**1-24**] through [**1-28**]: There is no pneumothorax since [**1-28**] following removal of the right pigtail pleural drain.
A right-sided pigtail chest drain is in situ.
He [**Month/Day/Year **] underwent BAL with diagnosis of PJP and CMV pneumonitis which were treated with bactrim and steroid taper and Gancyclovir.
KS with pulmonary involvement was treated with Paclitaxel and high dose steroids.
In addition he recieved treatment for Giardia, thrush, HSV type II skin lesion and hospital aquired pneumonia.
He also developed recurrent Hep B infection and was therefore started on HAART therapy.
His pneumothoraxes were treated by chest tube which was removed after bilateral pneumothoraces were stable by radiology report.
In the ICU he was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure, mechanically ventilated and a right chest tube was placed to prevent tension pneumothorax in the setting of known pneumothorax and positive pressure ventilation.
Mr. [**Known lastname 90417**] ICU course was complicated by septic shock, renal failure, non resolving right bronchopleural fistula, pancytopenia and ARDS.
Our attempts to wean off oxygen and pressors were to no avail.
Given his multi-organ failure, his profound immune supression and his poor underlying nutritional status it was felt that he no longer had realistic chance of recovery.
On hospital day 29 after discussion with his family and HCP and in keeping with their wishes Mr. [**Known lastname 90417**] goals of care were changed to focus on comfort measures.
