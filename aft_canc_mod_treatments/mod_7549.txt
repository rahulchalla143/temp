Hashimoto's disease/subclinical hypothyroidism: on levothyroxine 14: GERD 15 s/p left lower lobe resection in [**2157**] 17.
In [**2145**], more nodes wer found, and she underwent chemotherapy at that time.
Her post transplant course was complicated by disseminated Zoster (had for years--treated with acyclovir), encephalitis/ meningitis (?on Bactrim).
Biopsy revealed findings  c/w diffuse large B cell lymphoma with high-grade features, given the proliferation fraction of ~90%.
She underwent cycle 1 of ESCHAP 2/17-22/05.
She had a PET scan  [**2-2**] showing marked interval decrease in FDG-avid disease within the pulmonary parenchyma and interval resolution of FDG-avid lymph-adenopathy within the neck, mediastinum, and hila.
[**Date range (3) 95144**] - she was admitted for a 2nd autologous stem cell transplant with BEAM chemotherapy.
Pt initially started on meropenem and daptomycin.
Daptomycin and meropenem were ultimately discontinued.
# R knee pain: Pt presented with a swollen knee s/p a mechanical fall.
Patient's pain was managed briefly with PCA morphine pump, however, provided minimal relief.
Rheumatology was then consulted and treated her pain with systemic steroids (prednisone 20mg po x 3 days) and a single intraarticular injection with steroids.
She required straight cath for urinary retention on [**2165-10-30**]---likely secondary to narcotics and benadryl for transfusion pretreatment.

Patient was eventually started on low dose captopril in an attempt to reduce afterload.
Blood pressure would not allow this medication to be titrated up.
Pt may continue this medication after discharge as it may reduce fluid backing up into her lungs.
Pt was started on low dose captopril to reduce afterload.
Pt also underwent R sided thoracentesis to relieve her large R sided effusion.
She was given Lasix during transfusions to reduce incidence of pulmonary hypertension.
Patient also has a significant anxiety component to her dyspnea.
She achieved the greatest relief with Ativan 0.5 mg po prn.
During her time on the floor she maintained adequate oxygenation (satting > 97%), however, she reports decreased work of breathing with supplemental oxygen.
She will be discharged on supplemental oxygen, prn Ativan, captopril, albuterol/ipratropium inh and fentanyl PCA to provide her with maximal relief.
# Hypothyroidism: Pt was continued on levothyroxine until she developed difficulty swallowing pills secondary to her mouth pain.

You were treated with steroids and your pain and fever resolved.

This increased need for transfusions represents decline of your bone marrow function.
When given fluids to increase your blood pressure the fluid would often back up into your lungs making it difficult to breath.
