In the hospital, initially satting mid 90s on 7L nasal cannula; - pt was empirically started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for CAP, - was given IVF for iatrogenic [**Last Name (un) **] [**12-31**] to diuresis, - desaturation to low 60s on max flow HFNC and bipap, - requiring emergent intubation on [**4-20**] and transfer to ICU, where pt had worsenening GGOs on CT, initiation of vancomycin for [**12-2**] GPCs, cefepime for broadened coverage, bactrim for PCP coverage and solumedrol burst.
- Pt tolerated pressure control better than ARDS net ventilation.
- Pt briefly required levofed - Pt tolerated tube feeds since [**4-22**] - Pt stopped vanco and azithromycin - Had high glucan>400 so continued on bactrim for concern of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] bactrim switched to atovaquone for hyperkalemia.
- Pt's vent settings on transfer were pressure of 15/12 FIO2 50% for sats in mid to low 90s.

# Respiratory Failure - At VA pt initially presented with symptoms consistent with viral URI, but given severe underlying ILD, he rapidly decompensated requiring mechanical ventilation.
Pt was treated for bacterial pneumonia, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**] (given he is on chronic steroids) and was aggressively diuresed at the VA, but still ventilator dependent on admission to [**Hospital1 18**].
Pt also received pulse dose of steroids at VA with slight radiological improvement in disease state.
Pt had numerous barriers to extubation on presentation including high PEEP requirements, over-sedation and lack of resolution of his disease state.
A family meeting occurred and it was agreed that pt would need tracheostomy given prolonged intubation and oversedation.
A tracheostomy was performed without complication.
Patient was placed on Cefepime for [**Hospital1 16630**] (MDR Klebsiella sensitive to Meropenem/cefepime).
To prevent further episodes of emesis his tube feed rates were decreased and he was given PRN Zofran.
# Altered Mental Status:  On admission, pt was intubated and heavily sedated on propofol with RASS neg [**1-1**].
Reportedly, pt's mental status was normal prior to intubation at VA.  As per VA discharge summary, there was no reason for pt to have experienced an anoxic injury throughout hospital course.
However, during VA course, pt had been weaned off propofol and was "awake but not alert" on [**2168-5-8**].
Neurology was consulted and felt that initial exam was consistent with global encephalopathy secondary to being chronically sedated on fentanyl, versed and propofol in a person with a large body habitus.
After tracheostomy, pt was weaned off of sedation and started on haldol IV TID.
His prolonged period of unresponsiveness could be due to patient having a large volume of distribution (large body habitus), with sedatives now wearing off.
The pateint will need to continue cefepime until [**6-2**] and vancomycin until [**2168-5-30**].
Will need 2 week course of IV Vancomycin which was started on [**2168-5-17**] and should be complete on [**2168-5-30**].
\  # Polymyalgia rheumatica  - Pt was treated with methylprednisolone x3 days at VA.  Was previously treated with prednisone 15mg PO daily, but was never given PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
He was continued on home dose steroids of 15mg daily.
He was initially started on heparin drip for anticoagulation prior to tracheostomy placement.
After trach, he was started on coumadin for anticoagulation.
Transition Issues: - The pateint will need to continue cefepime until [**6-2**] and vancomycin until [**2168-5-30**].
