Brief Hospital Course: 60 yo male with HCV and recent imaging studies concerning for HCC vs CC vs combination, s/p IR guided biliary drainage and PTC drain placement, presenting with hemoperitoneum and distended abdomen.
Active Issues:  # Liver mass (HCC vs CC): IR guided procedure was performed [**2119-6-8**] without issue.
2 8-F percutaneous transhepatic cholecystostomy drains placed.
He was placed on meropenem to complete a 14 day course.
He required further IR procedures to place stents both in the left and right biliary systems.
A follow up appointment was made with heme/onc for discussion of further treatment.
He was given IVF and abx were broadened to vanc and zosyn from unasyn.
He was found to have worsening abdominal distension and SBO with hemoperitoneum on imaging.
Surgery was consulted and he was managed non-surgically for SBO with NGT and NPO.
Albumin was given for prerenal [**Last Name (un) **].
He was taken for repeat cholangiogram, drain placement verified and bile sampled for culture.
Cultures of the bile and pleural fluid grew Klebsiella and Enterobacter resistant to Unasyn and Zosyn.
A PICC line was placed and he was discharged to complete a 14 day course of Ertapenem.
This was believed to be a complication from biliary drain placement.
A chest tube was inserted which drained the effusion.
The chest tube was removed without difficulty and the pt was sat'ing in the mid 90s on RA.
The patient was noted to have a new right-sided pleural effusion after PTC placement in the biliary system.
He underwent PTC placement in the right pleural effusion for drainage, approximately 600cc of serosanguinous fluid was drained.
The patient's antibiotics were broadened to vancomycin and ciprofloxacin.
The patient was deemed not a surgical candidate at tumor board meeting but the patient was eligible for CyberKnife therapy via Radiation Oncology.
During the patient's take-back to the IR, suite, stents were placed in the right hepatic duct into CBD and left anterior main into CBD.
The right track to pleura was embolized, and a gold fiducial seed was placed into tumors.
The patient was intubated for procedure and subsequently extubated without a problem.
Pain was managed with scheduled APAP 500 mg q6hours and standing oxycodone 5mg q6hours.
