Brief Hospital Course: 62 year old HIV negative man who presented with mental status changes and was found on head MRI to have a right parietal/occipital biopsy-confirmed.
Right Parietal/Occipital Mass/Mental status changes: Outpatient workup for mental status changes included a normal head CT, a normal carotid U/S, and an unchanged ECG.
The enhancing areas were of concern for a neoplastic disease, particularly lymphoma.
Also, pt was hyponatremic at that time and electrolyte abnormalities could explain this.
Pt was premedicated with anti-nausea medication and started on leucovorin as a rescue.
(See labs section for trend).
Leucovorin was slowly increased during the methotrexate washout phase to 100 mg q6 hours.
He was made NPO and NGT  placed to suction drained feculent brown liquid.
It was discontinued on [**2195-12-4**] and aggressive bowel regimen was initiated.
He was started on proton-pump inhibitor IV twice per day and active T&S.
Pt was initially put on Zosyn and this was d/cd as hypoxia was resolving.
He was started on aggressive fluid hydration and then via the methotrexate protocol.
Vancomycin and zosyn were started.
Vancomycin was discontinued s/p LP in ICU on [**2195-12-3**] that showed no signs of meningeal infection or involvement.
Zosyn was discontinued on [**2195-12-6**] as pt was afebrile and there was no source of infection.
Administration of IV metoprolol 5 mg reduced blood pressure and resulted in baseline appearance on repeat ECG.
Additionally, pt received contrast for CT scan ([**2195-12-2**]) which is nephrotoxic.
Phos-lo was started and pt was aggressively fluid hydrated via the methotrexate protocol.
Phos-lo was discontinued once phosphate levels were normal.
Additionally, creatinine slowly started to trend back to normal towards the end of hospitalization after the peak.
On the floor before pt was transferred to the MICU, pt had hypertensive urgencies and then was on hydralazine q6 hours.
He was titrated up on metoprolol slowly to 37.5 mg with optimal control.
History of A. fib/PFO: Anticoagulation with coumadin held during the time of the open brain biopsy.
Additionally, pt's neuro oncologist did not want pt to be on coumadin and the levels could fluctuate secondary to methotrexate infusion.
On day prior to discharge, pt was started on Lovenox at prophylactic doses.
Hyperlipidemia: Pt's statin was held while NPO.
Access: Pt got a PICC line placed on [**2195-12-9**].
Prophylaxis:  Pt was on subcutaneous heparin, Pneumoboots, PPI, and a regular insulin sliding scale (secondary to Decadron).
