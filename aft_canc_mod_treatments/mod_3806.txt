Admission Date:  [**2141-3-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2141-5-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-3-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**] Chief Complaint: difficulty swallowing  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p 3-hole esophagectomy [**3-14**] for esophogeal cancer  History of Present Illness: 46yo Chinese gentleman who presented with a two-month history of postprandial epigastric discomfort.
A staging procedure on [**2141-3-1**], consisting of bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy, and EGD with gastric biopsy, was essentially negative.
Accordingly, he now presents for elective resection of the primary tumor.
Brief Hospital Course:      46yo M admitted to Thoracic surgery service after undergoing transthoracic near total esophagectomy with cervical esophagogastrostomy and feeding jejunostomy on [**2141-3-14**]; please see operative notes for details.
An epidural catheter was in place, as were #28 chest tubes bilaterally, 16F jejunostomy, and a #10 JP drain.
The chest tubes were initially placed to water seal, but developing pneumothorax prompted return to wall suction on POD 3.
The chest tube output appeared chylous, with moderately high output and elevated triglycerides, and therefore enteral feedings were held as TPN was initiated with octreotide via a new PICC.
The high chylous chest tube output prompted a return to the OR for thoracic duct ligation on [**2141-3-29**] via a R thoracotomy.
Nonetheless, the chest tube output remained high, (ie, 4 liters daily), electrolytes were corrected aggressively, and TPN continued.
At this point, there were 2 chest tubes on each side, with intermittent pneumothorax on the R.  The L posterior tube was removed with little output.
Broad-coverage antibiotics were tailered down to just vancomycin and continued based on the first negative blood culture.
The chest tube outputs had decreased from several liters to ~4-500cc daily each, and eventually both R chest tubes were removed.
TF's via the J-tube were begun on POD 34, supplemented with PO full liquids, and TPN weaned off.
However, the L chest tube then began having output of 1000-1500cc daily, became cloudier in appearance, and demonstrated intermittent air leak.
TPN d/c'd and tube feed to goal.
LFT's elevated-presumably from TPN which had been d/c'd.
Pt reminded NPO w/ resolution of symptoms - tube feed and po's resumed after 48hrs w/o further occurence of abd discomfort.
Air leak in left chest tube resolved and output slowed and chest tube was removed w/o incident.
Able to administer elixir medications and tube feed via j-tube w/ good technique.
Sent home w/ VNA services for continued assessment and j-tube care and management.
