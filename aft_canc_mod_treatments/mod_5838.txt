Admission Date:  [**2176-8-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2176-8-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2130-3-4**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5810**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central line placement Intubation [**2176-8-10**]; extubation [**2176-8-13**] Bronchoscopy [**2176-8-12**] IVC filter placement [**2176-8-15**]   History of Present Illness: 46 year-old male with DMI with recent admission for DKA and metastatic NSCLC s/p XRT recently started on chemotherapy admitted with altered mental status.
[**Name2 (NI) **] review of OMR, patient had not taken insulin in 3 days for unknown reason.
Of note, patient recently admitted with DKA, though at that time was reportedly taking his medications as directed.
Patient was noted to be diaphoretic, ill-appearing, and with Kussmaul respirations.
EKG showed peaked T waves; patient received calcium gluconate, 1 amp HCO3, albuterol nebs.
He did not received Kayexelate given concern for not being able to protect airway.
Potassium subsequently came down to 6.1 with unchanged EKG findings.
He received 5L NS and was also started on an insulin drip, currently at a rate of 6 units per hour.
He has remained afebrile and with improved heart rate following fluid resuscitation; 170/72, 99%RA, 20-26.
He had PET scan on [**6-24**] were he was found to have complete collapse of the right right lung and large pleural effusion s/p pleurex catheter placement for recurrent effusion [**Date range (1) 95587**], 10 rounds of radiation.
ET tube in standard placement.
Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
[**8-15**] (PRELIM) Successful placement of infrarenal non-retrievable IVC filter.
Serum potassium elevated on admission although likely total body potassium depleted given hyperglycemic diuresis.
Preceded by not taking insulin x3 days.
Insulin drip was started and transitioned to SC insulin [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] sliding scale once he was able to take PO's.
Potassium corrected with correction of hyperglycemia and EKG changes resolved.
Pt received anti-emetics and reglan for gastroparesis.
Psych meds were restarted and pt received haldol PRN for agitation, with further improvement in his mental status.
# Respiratory failure, acute: Pt was intubated [**2176-8-10**] at time of coffee-ground emesis (see below) to protect airway [**1-29**] agitation and vomiting.
IVC filter placed [**2176-8-15**] by IR to prevent clot to L lung to preserve function.
Pt was put on lovenox which was stopped given his thrombocytopenia and changed to fondaparineux as it has less likelihood of decreasing platelets.
At the time of discharge, his platelets were at 200,000 and so fondaparineux was switched to enoxaparin (60 mg sq [**Hospital1 **]).
Also possibility for ulceration given chemotherapy, radiation therapy.
No intervention was performed given he was intubated and he was medically managed with IV PPI.
Pt required 1 unit pRBCs for low Hct on [**8-11**].
Given large volume diuresis associated with DKA, most likely prerenal etiology.
ARF resolved with IVF and Cr at transfer was 0.6.
Cycle 1 of gemcitibane, carboplatin started [**2176-8-6**].
Pt's pain medications were adjusted to home regimen (changed home percocet to short acting morphine for break through pain).
Bipolar disorder: Pt's psych meds were intially held as pt was NPO due to altered mental status and concern for aspiration.
He was put on 1:1 sitter and home psych meds (Depakote, quietiapine, and venlafaxine) were restarted.
Lorazepam and dronabinol were stopped as they precipitate delirium.
# Thrombocytopenia, NOS: Plt count decreasing since admission, most likely due to chemotherapy given [**2176-8-6**], prior to admission.
# Hypertension, benign:  Not on medication therapy.
The decision was made to not give his sliding scale unless he eats and to give the sliding scale insulin AFTER the meal.
