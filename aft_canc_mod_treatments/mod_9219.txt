Her disease was initially diagnosed secondary to pancytopenia with circulating blast forms and a bone marrow in [**2182-5-9**].
She was initially treated with Procrit and weekly transfusions with packed red blood cells and Danazol from which she developed an allergic reaction.
Pt admitted for low dose ARA-C given over 14 days.
Skin: Diffuse bright red rash over arms and legs.

She was treated with 13 days of low-dose Ara-C as well as Hydroxyurea.
She was treated initially with a one time dose of GM-CSF which was then discontinued secondary to fevers.
AmBisome was eventually started for continued fevers, but then discontinued secondary to acute renal failure and switched to voriconazole.
The patient was empirically started on linezolid, and the vancomycin was discontinued.
Although course of antibiotics was completed, patient was kept on antibiotics given her unresolving neutropenia.
Cipro and aztreonam were added for double coverage of nosomial organisms, and flagyl as added for concern of anaerobic organisms associated with aspiration.
GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED ISSUES:  In the setting of thrombocytopenia, the patient developed melanotic stools on the Bone Marrow Transplant floor.
Gastroenterology was consulted and is following, holding off on colonoscope at this time.
She given vitamin K, as well as aminocaproic acid, and Protonix twice per day.
Although ultimately patient no longer passed melena, her hematocrit and platelets continued to trend downwards, requiring multiple transfusions of platelets daily and at least one unit of packed red blood cells every other day.
On [**2182-8-5**], patient was requiring minimal transfusions and had stabilized significantly.
?s abdomen suggested acute surgical issues, and general surgery was consulted.
?s profound thrombocytopenia and neutropenia that she would not survive surgical intervention.
She was given multiple boluses of intravenous fluids without significant improvement in her pressures.
She was started on low-dose dopamine for renal perfusion.
Patient responded appropriately to pressors, but after being weaned from the pressors, patient?????
The patient continued to be oliguric with improvement in the urine output with a low- dose dopamine drip.
The patient was also started on Bicitra 30 twice per day.
?s urinary output did improve at one point, suggesting a post-acute tubular necrosis diuresis, and prednisone was stopped.
?s pulmonary edema), patient was placed on a lasix infusion, to which she responded appropriately initially.
?s renal function began to worsen again, and it was felt that PRN boluses of lasix would be more beneficial.
?s renal function began to worsen acutely, with creatinine rising from 1.3 to 2.2, but it was felt that given treatment goals decided at this point by patient and family that dialysis was not indicated.
PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient was continued on albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease seen on computerized axial tomography with a longstanding history of smoking.
In addition, as stated above, patient began to undergo congestive heart failure, with pulmondary edema initially responsive to lasix diuresis.
During latter part of hospital course, patient also developed a respiratory infection of unknown etiology despite continuous broad-spectrum antibiotics.
The patient was started clobetasol and bacitracin topically as well as Sarna lotion for pruritus.
Approximately a week after vancomycin was discontinued, rash began to slowly improve, starting in the face and trunk.
Patient stated very clearly at that point with support from her family that because of her extremely poor prognosis despite invasive procedures required to continue prolonging her life that she wished comfort management only.
Patient was made comfortable with morphine for air hunger and benzodiazepines for agitation.
Medications on Admission: Procrit 40,000 units every week and Tylenol as needed.
