Admission Date:  [**2107-5-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2107-5-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2033-3-26**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT [**Location (un) **]  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed in [**Month (only) 404**] of this year, [**2106**], status post four cycles of fludarabine, Rituxan, Cytoxan, with the last treatment done on [**2107-4-14**], who presents with fevers and night sweats, fever as high as 102 degrees Fahrenheit for the last five days, fevers were associated with headache, relieved with aspirin.
Therefore, the patient was pan cultured except for urine and admitted for IV antibiotics and for further workup.
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosed in [**2106-12-1**] with chemotherapy which included fludarabine, Rituxan, Cytoxan and has undergone four cycles, the last cycle on [**2107-4-14**].
ALLERGIES:  The patient has allergies to sulfa drugs which manifests as rash.
Proscar 5 mg Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
Acyclovir 200 mg b.i.d.
Pentamidine 300 mg inhaler q. monthly.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted following blood cultures and started on empiric antibiotic therapy of ceftazidime 2 grams IV as well as filgrastim/Neupogen 300 mg subcutaneously q.d.
On [**2107-5-3**], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] was consulted as an Infectious Disease specialist and he agreed with the Oncology's team findings of starting Ceftazidime and filgrastim.
Recommended repeat blood cultures.
Infectious etiology is likely based on clinical correlation.
Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o.
The patient was given IV Demerol for rigors as well as a 200 cc bolus of normal saline which increased the systolic blood pressures to 102.
It was noted that he needed 5 liters of nasal cannula for saturations to increase to 90% and a 5 liter face mask was placed to increase his saturations to 96%.
The patient was started on amphotericin to cover for possible Aspergillosis as well as other fungal diseases given the patient's immune status.
On [**2107-5-7**], CT Surgery was consulted regarding the possibility of video-assisted thoracoscopy for collection of lung biopsy samples.
On [**2107-5-8**], the patient had a temperature spike to 102.5 as well as decreased 02 saturation to the high 80s despite 6 liters of nasal cannula.
Based on these findings and upon IDs recommendations, the patient had a bone marrow aspirate biopsy as well as aspirate for cultures that was done on [**2107-5-9**] without any difficulty, with tissue sent for gram stain / Cx, fungal and AFB stain/Cx, as well as C7 kappa, DD10, DD19, DD20, lambda, CD5 as well as CD3 were all sent as well as cultures.
The patient was intubated status post the procedure and sedated while the cultures on [**2107-5-8**] showed less than 10 polys, with less than 10 epithelial cells again with an oropharyngeal flora as well as moderate yeast.
The patient also had a chest tube placed that was put on suction overnight.
Antibiotics included levofloxacin, ceftazidime, as well as AmBisome for wide empirical coverage.
The patient had episodes of hypotension for which, in addition to IV fluid transfusion, Neo-Synephrine at 2 micrograms per kilogram was started.
The patient was started on IV Solu-Medrol 1g/d x 5d and serologies were sent for [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, as well as anti GVM antibodies.
On [**2107-5-10**], the patient was continued on ceftazidime, day number eight, levofloxacin, day number seven, ampicillin, day number five, as well as acyclovir for wide empirical prophylaxis.
The patient was also continued on Solu-Medrol 250 q. six hours.
On [**2107-5-11**], the patient was able to be weaned off Neo-Synephrine IV drip and also received a one time dose of IV Ig as well as 1 unit of platelets for thrombocytopenia.
The patient was being weaned on the propofol drip and was awake but continued to be intubated.
On [**2107-5-12**], the patient's chest tube was placed on water-seal.
The patient remained intubated but the patient was weaned down on pressure support with the PEEP from 12 down to 10, FI02 was also weaned.
The chest tube continued to put out residual and placed on water-seal.
Meanwhile, the patient was continued on IV Solu-Medrol 250 mg q. six to complete a five day course status post VATs procedure on [**2107-5-9**].
During the hospital course, the patient needed multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells as well as platelets during the hospital stay to maintain a hematocrit above 21, as well as a platelet count above 50,000 as per transfusion protocol guidelines for being in the ICU for evidence of active bleeding.
All microbiology cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage from video-assisted thoracoscopy as well as bone marrow cultures have all been negative up to this date.
The ceftazidime and eventually ampicillin was also discontinued.
On [**2107-5-14**], the patient's chest tube was removed revealing no air leak, increased output.
On [**2107-5-14**], the patient was resistant to weaning with a repeated decreased oxygen saturation off pressure support.
Therefore, vancomycin IV was started for empiric therapy for Staphylococcus aureus.
On [**2107-5-14**], the patient also ended a five day course of IV steroid therapy and, therefore, Solu-Medrol was discontinued and prednisone p.o.
Also, he continued to prove a persistent challenge for weaning off pressure support and the patient remained intubated with pressure support on 10 and 8 of PEEP.
It was also noted that the patient had a metabolic alkalosis from diuresis that was done that day.
The cause of the etiology of the metabolic alkalosis was probably due to volume depletion from diuresis from previous days to increase the patient's volume status in preparation for anticipated extubation.
Prior to that, vancomycin per IDs recommendations was recommended to be continued for a seven day course from initial administration.
His temperature spike was concerning in light of the patient having an indwelling Foley catheter as well as an arterial line as well as other peripheral lines in place.
Therefore, despite doubts of septic collection technique, vancomycin was still continued.
PT was consulted on [**2107-5-16**] to start physical therapy exercises as well as continue pulmonary toilet.
The Foley catheter was discontinued on [**2107-5-17**] as well as the arterial line was also discontinued.
On the night of [**2107-5-17**], the patient had some desaturation to the 80s despite 2 liters of nasal cannula.
On [**2107-5-18**], the patient was determined to have good rehabilitation potential and, therefore, was screened for a rehabilitation facility.
