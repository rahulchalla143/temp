The patient was diagnosed with a UTI 2 days ago, and was started on antibiotics (unclear what antibiotic).
He took 2 doses of the antibiotic and presented this a.m. with confusion.
During the resuscitation, he was given atropine 1 mg, epinephrine 1 mg, and amiodarone 300 mg.
He was subsequently intubated, receiving etomidate and succinylcholine peri-intubation.
He was started on peripheral dopamine, switched to levophed.
A central line was placed ED prior to transfer to the MICU.
Past Medical History: - Metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma to bone with local extension to bladder and rectum also complicated by bilateral hydronephrosis s/p nephrostomy tubes.
He has been treated with Casodex, Lupron, and most recently, Ketoconazole.
- Recently diagnosed extensive intrathoracic malignancy - Coronary artery disease - Atrial fibrillation (previously on coumadin) - Hyperlipidemia - Hypertension - Type 2 Diabetes - Pleural effusion s/p right thoracenteses x 2 in the past month   Social History: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has 8 children who live nearby and are involved in his care.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: bilateral nephrostomy tubes in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 1+ bilateral LE edema Neuro: Non-responsive to sternal rub or painful stimuli.
Pupils 3 mm and non-reactive.
However given his extensive comorbidity combined with grave prognosis and failure to respond to supportive measures, it was ultimately decided by the family to focus on comfort measures and the patient was terminally extubated and died on [**2113-6-13**].
# s/p asystolic cardiac arrest: His initial rhythm was asystole in the ER with underlying etiology unclear.
He had another episode on [**6-6**] when on pressure support on the vent and turning where is HR decreased, he desatted and his BPs dropped.
# Hypotension: Vital signs were normal on initial presentation but he became hypotensive requiring Levophed for blood pressure support s/p arrest.
His hypotension could be related to cardiac stunning in setting of recent arrest but was more likely related to underlying sepsis.
The patient continued to require norepinephrine for blood pressure support.
With acute renal failure and poor urine output, and hypervolemia on exam, the patient was transitioned to low dose dopamine gtt with lasix boluses on [**2113-6-8**], which improved his blood pressures and his creatinine 1.8 --> 1.7 with good urine output (100cc/hr X2-3 hours with each bolus).
Lasix gtt was started however his Cr rose and this was discontinued.
# Respiratory failure: He was intubated in the ER and has been ventilating well on the ventilator.
He did have a near arrest on CPAP and required reinitiation of full vent support.
The patient was gradually transitioned back from Assist Control to PSV with thoughts that intermittent tachypnea due to central process and some discomfort that responded to Fentanyl 25mcg boluses.
Neurology followed and recommended continuing EEG with somatosensory potential evaluation from [**6-4**] and [**6-7**] respectively.
Urostomy tubes bilaterally continued to put out purulent fluid although right urostomy tube output was persistently ~half that of left urostomy tube.
