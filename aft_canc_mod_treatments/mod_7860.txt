A PICC line was placed and she was started on TPN for nutritional support.
Gastrojejunostomy and feeding jejunostomy were performed.
Neuro: Her pain was well controlled initially with a PCA and prior to DC with oral dilaudid.
CVS: As recommended by Cardiology prior to surgery, she was started on beta-blockers that were continued postoperatively.
Because of her upper airway wheezes she was seen by the ENT service and on laryngoscopy was found to have reduced left vocal cord mobility and paradoxical cord movement.
