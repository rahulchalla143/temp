Patient was worked up on the floor including having cardiac enzymes which was significant for Trop of 0.23-0.26 NGT was placed for initiation of PO lactulose.
He was hypertensive in the 200's which was treated with lopressor and hydralazine but then became hypotensive after propofol bolus/gtt.
1mg ativan x2 and keppra was started.
On [**10-28**] pt had persistently flat EEG tracings consistent with sedation vs "brain death" per neurology.
He went into rapid afib requiring cardioversion, and started on dilt gtt w/ good effect.
He was started on paralytics as pt persistently overbreathing vent.
100mg lasix IVx1 not effective.
On [**10-30**] R femoral HD line placed for CVVHD planning.
ICP bolt removed, waited one hour, started heparin gtt given the thrombosis seen in hepatic v on CT.  On [**10-31**]: To IR for attempted thrombectomy, no clot identified.
Switched to meropenem and recultured for elevated WBC.
On [**11-2**] renal recommended peripheral blood smear for schistocytes, heme-onc reviewed smear (occasional schistocytes) and assessed as unlikely TTP.
Episode of a-fib with RVR (HR 160) converted with metoprolol 5 mg IV x 4 and diltiazem 10 mg. Demand ischemia with trop 1.44.
