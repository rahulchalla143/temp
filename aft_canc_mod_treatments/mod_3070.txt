WOUND CULTURE (Preliminary):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
New/increased left lower quadrant rim enhancing fluid collection, measuring up to 6.7 cm, anterior to the left iliacus muscle, where drain was placed previously.
CT-guided Intraabd abscess drainage [**2157-11-8**] 9:35 AM Technically-successful aspiration of left lower quadrant collection.
Technically-successful CT-guided drainage and catheter replacement into large left posteriorly layering collection anterior to the left iliac bone along the iliacopsoas tendon.
IR PICC [**2157-11-10**] Successful placement LUE double lumen PICC .
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the hospital on [**2157-11-7**] for fevers, rigors and hypotension and was found to have a new/increased fluid collection along the left abdominal wall with rim enhancement where the drain was before, now measuring 6.7 x 4.1 cm on and a forming ill-defined right lower quadrant-pelvic small collection measuring around 2 cm initial CT scan.
A 10 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheter was then left indwelling in the larger collection and was left on free drainage.
He was started on IV linezolid, flagyl and cefepime.
He initially tolerated the procedure well however, later that evening he became hypotensive with question of tongue swelling during IV cefepime administration.
Cefepime was stopped, he was given famotidine and benadryl and the patient was moved to the SICU on the evening of [**2157-11-8**] for closer monitoring.
The patient received IVF resuscitation and quickly restabilized and his tongue swelling resolved.
He was seen in consultation with ID and the cefepime was changed to meropenem and the flagyl also discontinued.
A LUE PICC line was placed in anticipation of potentially long-term antibiotics.
His INR was elevated and coumdain was held.
He was otherwise tolerating a regular diabetic diet with good ostomy output (both gas and liquid stool) and voiding well.
After discussions w/ NE [**Hospital1 **] regarding their availability of IV antibiotics (i.e.
they do not carry meropenem) and the ID service, it was decided that given the patient's stable condition for past few days, he was to be discharged with IV imipenem and PO linezolid.
Once his cultures are speciated and final, his antibiotics will be adjusted accordingly if necessary.
