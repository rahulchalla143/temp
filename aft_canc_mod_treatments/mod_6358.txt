Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Rifampin should not be used alone for therapy.
Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**5-/2468**]) immediately if          sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this patient's isolate.
Tracheostomy tube is in standard position.
CT Abdomen HISTORY: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with history of CVA, dementia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, status post tracheostomy, now with emesis for four days.
The patient underwent exchange of the GJ catheter earlier today.
CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is a moderate right and small left pleural effusion, with underlying atelectasis.
The gastrostomy balloon is located within the stomach, and the jejunostomy catheter terminates in the jejunum.
The greater omentum is abnormal, with nonspecific soft tissue infiltration.
This may be related to recent procedure/tube placement and reactive, but in the absence of recent instrumentation could be seen with neoplasm.
G-tube balloon in the stomach, and jejunostomy catheter terminating in the jejunum.
She was started on Vanc, Zosyn and Levofloxacin for Health Care associated pneumonia vs. aspiration PNA.
On the general medicine floor patient was continued for treatment of HAP, had G tube replaced to a GJ tube and thoracentesis to eval effusion.
Patient received lasix for diuresis.
On the floor patient's blood pressure ranged from 92-141/56-87, was re-started on outpatient B-blocker and started on lasix diuresis.
Patient was consequently intubated, required phyenlepineprine for pressor support and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
The patient was ultimately discharged with comfort measures.
Acute episode requiring intubation most likely related to aspiration.
Patient with poor urine output, did not respond to lasix and dopamine drip support.
Continued Zosyn and Vancomycin for total 8 days treatment ([**Date range (1) 83494**]) of HAP.
Scopolamine patch to decrease oral secreations.
Continued albuterol, ipratropium nebs prn for wheezing.
On [**5-22**], after much discussion with HCP and family, Mrs. [**Known lastname **], recieved a tracheostomy by thoracic surgery.
On [**5-23**] crepitus was noted around the trach site, thoracic surgery consulted, resolved without intervention.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was gradually weaned off the vent from [**5-22**] to [**5-31**] using MMV overnight due to apnea and PS during most of the day.
On [**5-28**], she had a possible aspiration event after GJ tube replacement, however, she was monitored for infection/fever, which did not develop.
Before discharge, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was tolerating her tracheostomy mask well with no signs of respiratory distress or infection.
However, upon discharge after repeated lengthy discussions with her family, it was determined that Ms. [**Known lastname **] was to be treated with comfort measures, so her trach was capped, and started on morphine, ativan, and continued on albuterol nebs while breathing on room air.
GJ tube replaced by IR on [**5-27**], with subsequent emesis and drainage of gastric contents out of tract.
G tube placed to suction and J tube to gravity.
She was started on tube feeds until she started to drain dark brown mildly heme-positive material from her gastric tube.
It was unclear if the drainage was either coffee ground emesis or feculent material from obstruction.
She remained NPO at discharge due to comfort measures.
Her G-tube was to gravity and J tube clamped.
Zosyn and Vancomycin were stopped due to concern of allergy and it is thought that the reaction most likely from Zosyn and not Vancomycin.
The rash was treated with supportive care and sulfadine creme to prevent super-infection.
Due to insensible losses, fluids were repleated as needed.
Patient was slowly weaned off pressor support.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] ultimately tolerated Lasix gtt started on [**5-28**] later transition to Q8 boluses, to diurese excess fluid off with a goal of negative 1 liter/day.
Cardiac Failure: EF demonstrated new regional wall abnormality and worsened MR, troponin and CK negative.
Held outpatient BB and CCB due to low blood pressure and due to comfort measures at discharge it is not recommended that any of her outpatient medications be restarted.
Rheumatoid arthritis: Held azathioprine in setting of acute infection and due to comfort measures at discharge it is not recommended that any of her outpatient medications be restarted.
Osteoporosis: Continued outpatient calcium and vitamin D and due to comfort measures at discharge it is not recommended that any of her outpatient medications be restarted.
After trying many interventions for her multiple medical problems, the patient seemed unlikely to recover.
She was started on morphine, ativan, and continued on albuterol nebs for comfort.
The remainder of her home medicines and medicines in the hospital were discontinued.
