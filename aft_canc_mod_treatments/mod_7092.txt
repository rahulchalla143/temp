On discussion with hepatology, decadron and XRT likely overstressed pts liver, causing acute decompensation.
He was started on aggressive lactulose and rifaxmin (initially required and NGT to administer this, but pulled this out within 24 hours and as mental status was improving to the point of being able to take POs safely, it was not replaced), and his mental status gradually improved significantly.
The patient's family and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 56871**] requested input from [**Hospital1 18**] heme-onc service to discuss further treatment options given his liver disease and hemorrhagic brain met.
Thoracic surgery was consulted and felt the patient would not benefit for thoracic surgery.
He has had [**3-29**] WBXRT treatments by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (rad-onc, in [**Location (un) 1456**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 106788**]).
Dr.[**Name (NI) 106791**] coverage recommended decadron taper on admission: 4 mg tid for 3-4 days, then taper to 4 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 3-4 days, then taper to 4 mg daily for 3-4 days, then 2 mg for 3-4 days, and then 2 mg qod for 3-4 days.
Per rad-onc here, no role for continuing WBXRT now given liver workup and possible resection of brain met; per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], he agrees with holding XRT in brain and lung for now.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 56871**], and neuro-onc here (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] all agreed to the resection, so he was transferred to the neurosurgery service on [**11-27**] for the operation which he tolerated without difficulty he was monitored in the PACU and was transferred to the surgical floor.
He required aggressive FFP and platelets before procedures.
Heparin SC was held.
He required platelet transfusions before procedures.
He did not have pain or fever, and anticoagulation would not be started anyway because of hemorrhagic brain met.
He was given thiamine and folate.
A CIWA scale was ordered but he did not require any benzos.
Lantus and RISS were started and titrated up as necessary.
# Hypertension: continued metoprolol  # Macrocytosis: B12/folate normal/high  The patient was transferred to the neurosurgery service and underwent craniotomy for tumor resection.
The patient required oxygen therapy while on the neurosurgery service and was unable to be weaned off.
He will continue this at rehab.
The patient will resume his radiation treatments at [**Hospital 1121**] Cancer Center for the lung and brain.
Thoracic surgery was consulted who felt that lung resection was not possible due to the stage 4 lung CA.
