He underwent ERCP and stent placement, then MRCP.
He was started on zosyn and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with a WBC of 11.7 and a Tbili of 8.0.
ERCP on [**2164-2-17**] showed stricture of the right and left hepatic ducts, left ductal system was accessible and stent was placed.
This was followed by PTBD on [**2164-2-17**] that placed an external drain into the right ductal system.
On repeat attempt on [**2164-2-21**], right and left internal/external drains were successfully placed.

-A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
-Cytology samples were obtained for histology using a brush in the left main duct.
-A 12cm by 7FR Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed successfully in the left main hepatic duct.
However, there is increased thickening of the hepatic flexure and tethering of the colon and duodenum at the level of the mass which may be causing partial gastric outlet obstruction.
Suggest nasogastric tube be placed on low intermittent wall suction on patient's return to the floor.
He was placed on Zosyn and briefly on neosynephrine upon admission to the ICU, but it was quickly weaned off.
He also received propofol for sedation during the ERCP which may have contributed to transient hypotension.
His home metoprolol and finasteride were held and his blood pressures remained stable.
The left intrahepatic duct was opened with biliary stent placement.
Sphincterotomy was performed and cytology samples were obtained for histology which was positive for adenocarcinoma.
He then underwent a successful right PTC and external drain placement extending across right ducts by Interventional Radiology.
He then underwent another IR procedure: placement of right and left internal and external drains once his cholangitis settled.
GI recommended against colonoscopy as his liver biopsy came back positive for adenocarcinoma suggestive of cholangicarcinoma.
Transplant surgery recommended transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] to consider surgical options after reviewing his case.
Patient was continued on Zosyn for 2 weeks course ending [**2164-3-2**] (OSH blood cultures grew E-COLI resistent to Levofloxacion, Ciprofloxacin, Ampicillin, Gentamycin and sensitive to Zosyn, Bactrim, Ceftriaxone, Ceftazidime, Amikcin, and Imipenim).
His Metoprolol and Finastride were restated.
His Doxazosin was also restarted at a lower dose of 2 mg at night.
He should be on aspirin but because of repeated procedures and recurrent biliary bleeding from righ biliary drain, this was on hold.
aspirin should be restarted as soon as possible.
On HD 18 IR was able to place an external drain into the right anterior duct system.
the patient was tachycardic post procedure and was given a 250cc bolus of NS.
He was kept NPO and an NG tube was placed due to persistent abdominal distention.
An UGI w/ SBFT was done on HD 19 that showed a narrowing of the first and second portion of the duodenum and delayed gastric emptying due to the gastric outlet obstruction.
TPN was initiated and both both IR and GI attempted to place a GJ through the stricture site but failed.
The patient and his family, after multiple discussions, both decided that focusing his care around comfort measures would be a goal of further treatment.
A gastric tube was placed by IR on HD 26 and the patient was made DNR/DNI.
This tube was placed to gravity and the patient was allowed to take sips ad lib.
He will be discharged to a skilled nursing facility near his home where he will receive further care and be close to his wife and son.
