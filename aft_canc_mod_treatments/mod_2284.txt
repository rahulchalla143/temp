Brief Hospital Course: 50 yo M with T3N2 squamous cell esophageal cancer s/p Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy in [**9-/2126**], chemo/XRT and CT in [**2-17**] with new para-aortic LAD concerning for disease progression, lingular opacity now presenting with 3 weeks of productive cough, vomiting, weight loss, hypovolemia and found to have multi-focal PNA.
Staging CT scan revealed LUL collapse, concerning for obstructing mass, with bronchoscopy complicated by desaturation, tachycardia, hypotension, requiring MICU admission.
He initially did well off the vent, but had persistent aspiration/vomitting secondary to malignancy and once again, he went into respiratory distress requiring reintubation.
Ultimately, his entire left lung collapsed secondary to bronchial compression from tumor burden and it was determined that he would not be able to be weaned off of the mechanical ventilation.
Together they made the decision to transition to CMO with extubation but pt wanted to remain on the ventilator until his wife could come from [**Country 3587**] to say goodbye.
