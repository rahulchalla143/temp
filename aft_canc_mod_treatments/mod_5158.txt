DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3891**]         Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted on [**12-4**] and underwent resection of R atrial mass and closure of PFO.
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on Neo and Propofol.
She was extubated on the post op night and had her chest tubes removed on POD#1.
She was bradycardic and required intermittent epicardial pacing.
EP evaluated her and determined that she did not need pacer placement as she had good AV conduction and her HR responded to exercise.
Her pacing wires were d/c'd on POD#6.
Her visual deficit was most likely related to emboli and no further recommendations were made as she was already on Aspirin therapy.
