# Hypoxia/Health Care Associated PNA - Patient c/o SOB and sating only 90 on NRB so transitioned to BiPAP.
She was started on Vanc, cefipime from ED and levoquin was added for increased psuedomonal and atypical coverage.
Patient wean off BiPAP breifly, but was again found to be lethargic with PCO2 in 70s.
Continue Abx, but can give morphine for pain/respiratory discomfort.
The pt will complete a 10 day course of levofloxacin, as the family refused midline to continue Cefepime treatment.
The pt was seen by gerontology, who made recommendations on her medications from a palliative care perspective.
For discomfort the pt will be discharged on both standing ativan and ativan as needed (which often helped her) as well as concentrated morphine solution (both standing and as needed) which can be titrated up as needed.
She was satting 90% on 5L NC at discharge, mildly dyspneic.

Humidified shovel mask plus extra morphine can be considered (if pt tolerates) if she becomes more dyspneic.
However some triggers below are to be used with pt's wishes.
- Avoid Foley catheters  -try to avoid anticholinergics, and sleeping medications.
