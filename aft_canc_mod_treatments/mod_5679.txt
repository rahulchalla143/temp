Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 69 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 97846**] 23 -7        Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 37080**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent flexible bronchoscopy, VATS right lower lobe wedge resection, followed by a VATS right lower lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection.
He was initially extubated, however in the PACU, he developed hypotension requiring pressors, and progressive respiratory acidosis requiring reintubation for airway protection and repeat flexible bronchoscopy.
He was weaned from the ventilator and extubated without complication on the morning of post-operative day #1 ([**2150-7-25**]).
Despite being awake and alert he developed agitation and confusion requiring a 1:1 sitter, but he continued to improve clinically, and was transferred to the floor on [**2150-7-27**].
He began to get out of bed and ambulate with the assistance of physical therapy, and his mental status gradually cleared to the point where he no longer required a sitter or other supervision.
