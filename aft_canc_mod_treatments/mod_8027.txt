By the end of the procedure there had been no significant changes .
Broken sternal wires are again seen.
Given lasix 40mg IV x 2, and bolused conservatively.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course: Patient was transferred for further management of hypercapnia and her volume status.
She was seen by cardiology in consultation who felt that she needed gentle diuresis, and that when she was ready to leave the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] should be transferred to the cardiology service for further management of her volume status.
Received 60 then 40 IV Lasix with good UOP.
hypercapnea:   Thought to be due to increased work of breathing from CHF from her AS and diastolic CHF, Patient likely had mild CO2 retention at baseline as reflected in elevated bicarb on prior labs, acute worsening may have occurred in setting of peri-op sedatives/pain meds, atelectasis and volume overload.
Cardiology Course:  Patient was transferred to the cardiology service on [**2195-12-12**] for further management of her volume status.
She was diuresed with with IV lasix as needed with a goal of taking off about 1L per day for to help maintain her BP since she is very preload dependent with her severe AS, with most recent valve area of 0.8cm2.
Her blood pressure tolerated the diuresis well.
At rehab she should receive LASIX 40 IV BID AND BE EVALUATED DAILY IN TERMS OF VOLUME STATIS.
THIS SHOULD BE TITRATED DOWN TO HER HOME DOSE OF LASIX 60MG DAILY.
She should NOT be given lasix if her systolic blood pressure is under 100 as she has severe aortic stenosis.
If she becomes hypotensive, she will need small IV fluid boluses since she is very preload dependent with her severe AS.
If given IV lasix she should have her electrolytes checked to make sure potassium is above 4 and her magnesium is above 2. urrently she has crackles in her lungs left>right and some wheeze for which she is receiving ipratropium nebs.
#) CAD s/p CABG: currently stable, she was continued on her outpatient regimen of atorvastatin and metoprolol.
She was restarted on aspirin 81mg daily during her stay.
#) Atrial Fibrillation: patient has been chronically in AF on coumadin, her coumadin was held prior to her surgery, and restarted post operatively.
Since she has no history of stroke, TIA, DVT or PE she did not have an indication for bridging so she has been on her home coumadin dose, and we have been allowing her INR to increase slowly especially in the post operative setting.
She was continued on her home metoprolol for rate control, however her rate control was suboptimal so she was also loaded with digoxin and started on .0625mg daily, for better rate control with less blood pressure effects.
After her eventual extubation, she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for increasing somnolence, which has been improving during her stay.
SHE IS CURRENTLY ON 0-1/2L OF OXYGEN AND THIS SHOULD BE TITRATED DOWN AS QUICKLY AS POOSSIBLE TO KEEP HER O2 SATS BETWEEN 90-94% to help prevent her from retaining more CO2 .
#) S/P Right Hemicolectomy: patient had a right hemicolectomy for a sessile polyp found on colonoscopy after a GI bleed after her valvulplasty for her severe AS.
Pathology showed low grade adenocarcinoma, per surgery T2N0, so no further treatment needed at this time.
#) Venous Stasis with Ulcerations: patient with chronic venous stasis ulcers, wound care evaluated the patients and provided the following recommendations: Recommendations:  Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines Support surface: Atmos Air Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn Heels off bed surface at all times Waffle Boots to B/L LE's If OOB, limit sit time to one hour at a time and sit on a pressure relief cushion, Gaymar Cushion .
Apply Aquacel dressings over the wound beds to absorb drainage Cover with dry gauze, Sofsorb sponge Secure with tubular stocking (she states she does not tolerate Kling or Kerlix Dressing changes were increased to twice daily due to large amounts of drainage on the dressings.
#) Hypertension: blood pressure remained well controlled on home metoprolol .
#) Hyperlipidemia: continued home statin .

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a colectomy for a colon mass.
After the surgery you required admission to an intensive care unit because you were having trouble with your breathing (due to retaining carbon dioxide which caused sleepiness) and because you needed to have lasix due to having extra fluid in your body.
You were then transferred to the cardiology floor where you required additional doses of lasix to help get extra fluids off your lungs.
You will likely need additional doses of lasix at rehab.
Three days ago you also had an increased heart rate and you received some extra medications by mouth and by IV to slow your heart rate down.
Your atrial fibrilation is now well controlled on your home dose of metoprolol and we also started a new medication called digoxin.
The following medications were started: digoxin 0.0625mg daily ipratropium neb 1 every 6 hrs prn sob or wheeze Aspirin 81mg daily Colace 100mg twice a day heparin sc 5000 units three times a day oxycodone 5mg po q8hrs prn leg pain- need to monitor for sedation .

The following medications were changed in dose: tylenol increase to 1g every 8 hours your lasix dose will be determined by your doctor at rehab .
The following medications were discontinued: Ativan  Followup Instructions: You should follow up with your primary care physician [**Name8 (MD) **], [**Name9 (PRE) **] after you are discharged from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2660**].
