The large right frontal lobe lesion is difficult to see on this study, compared with prior MR study, but is likely unchanged.
Patient has undergone prior right-sided parietal craniotomy and there is also a prior burr hole present in the right frontal bone.
Worsening right-to-left subfalcine herniation, and new right-sided uncal herniation and transtentorial herniation.
IMPRESSION: Right hemicraniectomy and decompression with significant improvement in right uncal and downward transtentorial herniation, persistent subfalcine herniation with trapping of the left lateral ventricle.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50yo man with h/o glioblamotosis cerebri who presented with altered mental status and for radiation treatment for his tumor.
Altered mental status: Pt was admitted to the NeuroICU and started on dexamethasone and mannitol for herniation.
He also received a 500mg bolus of intravenous dilantin.
His medications were continued without problems.
[**Name (NI) **] then went for a hemicraniectomy on the right in order to provide decompression on [**2112-8-5**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
This was done because he will continue to receive XRT and chemo which will likely result in more swelling in the future.
He tolerated the procedure well and was quickly extubated after returning to the ICU from the OR.
He is now at a theraputic dose of keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **].
He received his first planning session and first dose of WBXRT today on the OMed service.
He will be transferred back to [**Hospital1 **] where he will continue WBXRT with temodar given one hour before XRT.
Decadron will be continued during XRT because of risk of increased swelling.
He was started on Zyprexa to help with agitation which is likely secondary to decadron and frontal lobe location of the tumor.
Given that he was at a hospital when this developed, he was started on vancomycin and ceftazidime to cover for MRSA, typical CAP bacterium, and pseudomonas.
His initial fever also resolved on antibiotics.
S/P right hemicraniectomy: As above, the pt underwent a decompressive hemicraniectomy on the right.
His bone flap is stored at [**Hospital1 18**] and will likely be re-attached in [**2-15**] months to allow for swelling with radiation.
Oral Thrush: Pt has been maintained on clotrimazole toches QID to treat oral thrush.
He will continue with his chemotherapy/radiation treatment, for which he should be brought to [**Hospital1 18**].
He should receive Temodar as prescribed one hour before all radiation treatments.
