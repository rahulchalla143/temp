The patient has a new esophageal stent for mid-esophageal cancer.
Long esophageal stent has migrated slightly cephalad by 2 cm.
[**11-7**] PICC LINE PLACEMENT: IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a right PICC with tip terminating in the mid SVC.
Admitted for placement of feeding tube and initiation of concurrent chemoradiation in the setting of no insurance.
Patient tolerated placement of tube well and tube feeds were eventually titrated to goal.
He was transitioned through several antibiotics before being treated with Gent/Zosyn.
He was then placed on fluid restriction, but became relatively [**Name2 (NI) 112391**] and hypotensive with SBPs 90-100s with transient runs of tachycardia.
Patient was treated with IVFs and briefly had antibiotic regimen broadened to vancomycin.
Patient developed RIGHT dorsal foot pain and in setting of recent bacteremia MRI was performed that did not show evidence of osteo.
In ICU, Na noted to have dropped to 120, and he was started on hypertonic saline.
Repeat Na was 127, and hypertonic saline stopped.
Renal was consulted for further management of his hyponatremia.
Patient already on Zosyn, and antibiotic coverage broaded to include vancomycin to provide empiric gram positive coverage.
Plan for feeding tube as esophageal tumor causing high grade obstruction of esophagus.
Pt had open G tube placement [**10-6**].
Tube Feeds started [**10-6**].
He was variously able to tolerate tube feeds initially with initial feeding rate titrated to level of distension.
By the time of discharge, he was meeting his goal tube feeds and was sent home on continuous feeds from caregroup and managed by his daughter and [**Name (NI) 269**].
He will continue with radiation therapy for the next 2 weeks and follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further chemotherapy planning as an outpatient.
Brief Hospital Course: # SCC of the esophagus: In addition to the management outlined above, he remained in the hospital until [**11-15**] and completed another round of chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-FU without complications.
He also completed an additional week of radiation  therapy.
# Urinary retention: By the time of discharge, he had successfully passed a voiding trial on tamsulosin and no longer required a foley catheter.
# G-tube site: On [**11-14**], minor white-yellow thin drainage was noted around the G-tube site associated with 2-3mm of erythema and induration.
The drainage did not appear to be tube feeds given differences in color and consistency.
Continued daily ceftriaxone until [**2200-10-12**].
Surveillance culture subsequently grew a GNR later speciated as Capnocytophagia and so antibiotics were broadened to Gentamycin/Zosyn.
These were negative on MRI, so vancomycin was discontinued.
On [**10-20**] patient developed hematemesis of bright red blood and clots also with blood found on G-tube draws during residual checks.
He was transfered to ICU for endoscopy on [**10-21**] which revealed clot above a malignant stricture.
This was not intervened upon because did not have significant active bleeding and any intervention would have likely been short lived with re-bleeding to follow.
The cause of this is likely due to fluid restriction for treatment of his SIADH.
After his endoscopy on [**10-21**] it was found that his sodium was recovering so fluid restriction was removed.
His sepsis physiology improved with hydration at the expense of another drop in sodium, as discussed below.
# HYPONATREMIA: Patient developed hyponatremia that trended down to nadir of 128 a few days after cisplatin dosage on [**10-7**].
Urine lytes showed high osmolality and salt wasting and this was eventually attributed to SIADH from cisplatin effect.
Pt was placed on fluid restriction.
Patient was taken off fluid restriction and hydrated which subsequent recovery in creatinine and Na.
Throughout this admission there was a balancing act between hydration to treat sepsis physiology and fluid restriction for SIADH.
Tube feeds were eventually switched to TwoCal HN to further restrict free water.
On [**11-1**] pt recieved hypertonic saline in the ICU and then was transfered back to the floor.
His medications were also concentrated to restrict free water.
He was also started on tamsulosin, with less blood pressure effects per pharmacy.
eccentric MR jet, moderate (2+) MR.
Recently seen by cardiology and felt there is no indication for medications at this time given normal LV function.
He is considered to be stable for surgery and chemo as needed.
Doxazosin held in setting of low BP.
Tamsulosin started.
Urinary retention managed with Foley as above.
# IV Antibiotics: PICC line in place for anticipate 4 weeks of IV Zosyn.
# Tube feeds: Arranged for continuous tube feeds at home.
Anticipate improvement in urinary retention now that he has started on tamsulosin.
Brief Hospital Course: # SCC of the esophagus: In addition to the management outlined above, he remained in the hospital until [**11-15**] and completed another round of chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-FU without complications.
He also completed an additional week of radiation  therapy.
# Urinary retention: By the time of discharge, he had successfully passed a voiding trial on tamsulosin and no longer required a foley catheter.
# G-tube site: On [**11-14**], minor white-yellow thin drainage was noted around the G-tube site associated with 2-3mm of erythema and induration.
The drainage did not appear to be tube feeds given differences in color and consistency.

You were admitted to start your chemotherapy (cisplatin/flourouracil) and radiation therapy.
In preparation for the side effects of treatment, you recieved a tube leading to your stomach through which you could recieve nutrition.
We controlled this with pain medication and numbing mouthwashes.
You had been treated with a month of the antibiotic ceftriaxone.
We switched your antibiotic several times and ended up with a regimen covering a broad spectrum of bacteria.
At the same time we found that you had been infected with the parasite Strongyloides and so we started treatment for this with the anti-parasite medication Ivermectin.
You will continue on IV antibiotics for approximately 1 month after your discharge from the hospital.
We felt that this was due to either a condition called SIADH or as a side effect of your chemotherapy (the cisplatin component).
About two weeks into your radiation treatments you started vomiting blood and blood clots.
You also developed difficulty urinating since you are off of your prostate medication due to low blood pressure.
You will have a Foley catheter in your bladder until it is safe to be taken out.
You have also been started on a different prostate medication called tamsulosin in place of doxazosin.
You will be receiving IV antibiotics for approximately 3 weeks through your IV.
