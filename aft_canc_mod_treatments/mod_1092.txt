Admission Date:  [**2160-1-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-1-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2099-11-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Bactrim  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: Fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Skin Biopsy   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 59 yo M with h/o multiple myeloma s/p allo transplant 95 days ago now with fevers x 1 day.
A CT Chest was performed but not read at the time of admission to BMT (received 1L NS pre-treatment).
His case was discussed with the on-call oncology fellow who wanted him started on levo/vanco and admitted to the BMT service for futher workup.
He received 1gm vanco and levofloxacin 750mg x 1 in the ED.
Past Medical History: -- CAD s/p non-ST elevation -- Myocardial infarction and stent placement on [**2157**] -- Hx of DVT, no longer on anticioagulation -- HPT -- Gastroseophagel reflux disease -- Depression -- Rhinnorrhea week prior to transplant hospitalization -- Multiple myeloma s/p 4 cycles of VAD, auto SCT in [**2156**], dendritic cell fusion vaccine in [**2157**].
Cytoxin and Velcade in [**2158**] and Revlimid started in [**7-20**].
Mini-Allo transplant in [**10-21**].
Oncology History: Diagnosed in [**2155**], treated with 3 cycles of VAD and  then underwent an autologous stem cell transplant in 03/[**2156**].
He was enrolled in the dendritic cell vaccine study; however, in [**3-/2157**], he had a cardiac event that resulted in the stem placement and has been followed closely by cardiology.
In [**10/2157**], the patient was noted to have a rise in his Bence [**Doctor Last Name **] protein, in his urine, and was started on thalidomide, then treated with 2 cycles of Velcade and Decadron withpout response.
Then was given one cycle of Cytoxan at 1 gm per meter square on [**2158-5-29**] and was noted to have reduction in excretion of Bence [**Doctor Last Name **] protein to  2200 mg per day.
He also received XRT in the low-back area in 06/[**2158**].
He was then started on Revlimid and Decadron back in [**6-/2158**] for approximately 2 cycles.
He remained on this  medication for about a year.
He eventually underwent reduced intensity allogeneic transplant with Campath conditioning in [**10-21**].
Comment: The histologic appearances favor a drug reaction, however, given the findings of focal "tagging" of lymphocytes at the [**Last Name (un) **]-epidermal junction and rare dyskeratotic keratinocytes, graft versus host disease (spongiotic type) cannot be entirely excluded.

Transferred to ICU for respiratory distress, nasal aspirate returned w/ Influenza A positive.
He was on voriconazole initially upon transfer to the ICU, his galactomannan and Beta glucan had returned negative and this medication was stopped.
Pending upon discharge was a repeat CMV viral load (negative on [**2160-1-15**]) as well as a histoplasmosis and blastomycosis antigen.
Prophylaxis: Patient was initially on pentamadine for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
He was started on atovaquone 1500mg po daily empirically when he began to display respiratory distress prior to influenza A returning positive.
He was left on Atovaqone for PCP prophylaxis as it was thought this would provide better protection.
Patient is day +103 upon discharge for mini transplant for multiple myeloma.

In addition you had a rash and were started on prednisone, it is possible that this was graft versus host disease of the skin but more likely it was a drug reaction to either levofloxacin or vancomycin.
You should continue taking prednisone 20mg daily until instructed to decrease this dose.
