Most recently, she has noticed dark stools and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended surgical intervention.
Past Medical History: Arterio-venous malformations Diabetes Hypertension Hyperlipidimia Coronary artery disease hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  Social History: The patient has a 35-pack history of smoking.
After a ventricular premature beat, the tracings demonstrated the classic Brockenbrough-Braunwald sign (the peak systolic gradient increases after a VPC and the pulse pressure decreases - due to increased dynamic obstruction caused by the post extra-systolic potentiation).
She proceeded to the OR on [**2199-1-22**] where she underwent a right hemicolectomy with ileo-colostomy and repiar of umbilical hernia.
She required some IV fluid boluses for low CVP but otherwise had no complications in the ICU.
Her heart rate and blood pressure were well-controlled in the intensive care unit with lopressor and an esmolol drip, with goal settings for pulse in the 60s as recommended by cardiology and CT-surgery.
She was switched to PO lopressor and started on PO cardizem on post-operative day 8, which she tolerated well with pulse near the goal range of 60s-70s.
She was discharged on post-operative day 9 in good condition, with planned follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] within 2 weeks and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for discussion of eventual alcohol-ablation of her outflow obstruction.
