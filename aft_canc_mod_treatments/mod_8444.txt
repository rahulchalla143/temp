Coli  # Hypotension ??????
For the patient's hypotension, she was initially placed on pressor support with Levophed; she also received broad-spectrum antibiotics per ID recommendations.
Her antibiotic regimen was tapered to cover her enterococcus bacteremia as well as cipro-resistant E. coli UTI with Unasyn.
Her indwelling PICC line was removed and a temporary CVC was placed.
Her pressure continued to be labile after appropriate antibiotic therapy and she maintained clear mentation and good Uop despite BPs in the 80s-90s/50s.
Her pressors were weaned off.
She was continued on antibiotics on [**8-9**] (amp/sulbactam).
She was transferred to the oncology service for further management where her blood pressure remained stable.

The rash appeared fungal and she was given miconazole cream as well as micafungin, this was completed on [**8-11**] (7 days of Micafungin).

She received nutritional supplements as per her home regimen.
Her ostomy was closely cared for and she was placed on anti-diarrheals to decrease output.
She was given IVF to keep up with ongoing losses.

She was placed on pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis, however, as listed above, lovenox was restarted give her high risk for VTE and stable hematocrit.
She did have RUE edema at site of picc, US was negative for DVT, PICC was left in place due to difficult placement in IR and in case she requires further IVF or transfusions.
