Admission Date:  [**2137-2-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-2-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2076-6-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**] Chief Complaint: SOB   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracenteses x2 Pleurex catheter placement  History of Present Illness: 60 y/o female with recently dx metastatic breast presents with fatige and SOB.
She has not had further thoracentesis or paracentesis performed since discharge.
She was started on Vanco and Cefepime.
Gastric bx confirmed dx of metastatic breast ca and she was started on paclitaxel.
She developed BL pleural effusions which required thoracentesis x 2 (lasat [**2137-1-15**] for 1200cc).
Tx with neoadjuvant chemo then modified radical mastectomy and postop radiation.
While on tamoxifen in [**2127**], she developed a left-sided tumor and had a modified radical mastectomy with TRAM flap.
She then took Arimidex until [**2132**].
- [**12-14**] [**Hospital1 18**] hospitalization dx with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma on gastric bx consistent with met breast ca.
Presented with lichen planus, adenexal mass, malignant pleural effusion and evidence of bone mets consistent with stage 4. s/p Pacitaxil [**1-12**] and [**1-18**] - Hypothyroidism - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia .
SurgHx: Bilateral modified radical mastectomies with reconstruction.
Has support from friends and [**Name2 (NI) 9259**].
No first degree relatives with breast, ovarian, colon, endometrial cancers.
Physical Exam: Admission: VS: Temp: 95.8 BP: 108/69 HR: 109 RR: 23 O2sat 92% on nonrebreather GEN: cachetic and drowsy but NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, pale conjuctiva, DMM, op with whitelesions, no jvd RESP: Anteriorly decreased BS at the bases.
Given the clinical history, the possibility of a metastatic lesion is a strong consideration; however, dural enhancement or vascular enhancement cannot be completely ruled out, correlation with a dedicated MRI of the orbits and frontal lobe with high-resolution and gadolinium is recommended.
There is also some volume loss/infiltrate in the right lung.
Hypoxia / hypercarbia: She initially required a non-rebreather to keep her O2 sats >90%.
Since her CXR showed a possible RLL PNA, we did cover for a simultanous HCAP with Vancomycin and Cefepime.
She received 2 thoracenteses during her ICU stay, 1 on each side, with good effect and improvement in her oxygen saturation.
IP was consulted regarding pleurx catheter placement, which was done on [**2-15**] on the right side, without complication.
A left pleurex catheter was placed on [**2-17**] without complications.
Her Pleurex catheters were drained daily, with alternating sides each day.
She should continue this alternating drainage daily after discharge.
She has been total body overloaded and responding well to IV furosemide.
She tolerated gentle diuresis and was started back on her home dose of furosemide prior to transfer to the floor with resultant tachycardia, which responded to NS bolus.
Her lasix was subsequently discontinued given the tachycardia, and may be restarted if O2 requirement worses.
She may not need continued diuresis with her new pleurx catheters.
She is currently on both long-acting morphone and short-acting doses for breakthrough pain, but her pain has been very well controlled on the MSContin with minimal breakthrough requirements.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 **]Hospice House  Discharge Diagnosis: ## Widely metastatic breast cancer, with new evidence for probable intracranial and intracardiac metastatic foci ## Cachexia secondary to above ## Pulmonary emboli - right and left subsegmental branches, not on anticoagulation due to concerns re: brain metastases ## s/p recent neutropenic episode s/p Taxol therapy ## Febrile with neutropenia - no clear source of infection identified, treated empirically with vanco/cefepime ## diarrhea ## Hypothyroidism ## Hypertension ## Unstageable sacral ulcer   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
After a full discussion of your prognosis with your doctors, it was decided to continue to support you but avoid further chemotherapy as well as heroic measures and you asked to be discharged to hospice.
