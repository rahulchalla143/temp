Brief Hospital Course: *) Small Bowel Obstruction She was taken to the operating room for surgical exploration.
She underwent a small bowel resection with re-anastamosis and resection of pelvic tumor.
A nasogastric tube (NGT) was placed intra-operatively and left in place, and she was maintained on bowel rest.
On post-operative day #5, NGT output had decreased, and after clamping the tube with minimal residual output, it was removed.
However, the following day she developed nausea and vomiting, and the tube was replaced.
TPN was weaned off and then discontinued as her diet was advanced.
She was aggressively hydrated with IVF boluses and continuous drips.
She was also given 2 units of FFP to reverse coagulopathy and transfused with PRBC due to intra-operative blood loss and a hematocrit that drifted down in the post-operative period.
She was initially on a norepinephrine drip, but this was weaned off with good effect.
Vancomycin and Zosyn for broad coverage of enteric pathogens were started.
Vancomycin and Zosyn were initiated for broad-spectrum coverage of enteric pathogens, due to her extensive bowel surgery.
The antibiotics were discontinued once she had been afebrile for 48 hours.
She was started on clotrimazole lozenges and oral Nystatin for thrush on post-operative day #19 and received one dose of IV fluconazole and two doses of oral fluconazole, with subsequent improvement of her thrush.
*) Cardiovascular She was initially tachycardic up to the 120's after surgery, which was attributed to her fevers and general state of inflammation post-operatively.
*) Pulmonary She was electively intubated for surgery and remained intubated in the setting of hypotension and possible sepsis/shock post-operatively.
On the surgical floor she had one episode of desaturation to 87% on room air, but this was in the setting of a likely post-ictal state and immediately normalized with supplemental oxygen.
The oxygen was weaned off and she afterwards maintained excellent oxygen saturation on room air.
*) Epilepsy Ms. [**Known lastname 1661**] has a longstanding history of seizures and has undergone a temporal lobectomy in the past.
Neurology was consulted for input regarding her medications, and recommended continuing IV Keppra and increasing IV Ativan to cover her usual Lamictal (unavailable in an IV form).
Post-operatively, Ativan was initially held due to sedation/intubation.
*) Depression/Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Due to being NPO for a prolonged period of time, she was unable to receive her usual anti-depressant medication.
Psychiatry was consulted and continued to follow and provide support during her hospital course, as did Social Work.
*) Hypothyroidism Her levothyroxine was continued, after conversion to IV dosing ([**12-1**] po dose = IV dose).
Labs were re-checked 1 week later and her TSH had normalized, with normal free T4 and T3, so her usual dose of levothyroxine was maintained and transitioned back to oral dosing when she was able to tolerate oral intake.
