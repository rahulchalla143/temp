Her work-up in the hospital included normal shunt series, normal VP tap (but protein 60) and unremarkable LP.
Work-up further revealed bilateral hilar infiltrates on CXR, with preserved saturation at presentation.
She was started on empiric Rx for PCP with Bactrim and Prednisone on [**2129-8-7**], and Levofloxacin was added to cover for atypicals.
ABG on floor on shovel mask 70% 7.28/31/71.

She was also started on steroids.
The pt was extremely difficult to ventilation requiring high PEEP and pressure support.
Pt was then made CMO and she was slowly weaned off the ventilator.
2) Hemodynamic instability: Patient was persistently hypotensive during her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay.
She initially required Levophed to maintain her urine output and blood pressure but Dopamine was added in hope to wean the Levophed down.
This was unsuccessfull and she required pressors until her family decided to change her code status to CMO.
3) Abdominal distention: Patient required extremely high amounts of Fentanyl and Versed to keep her sedated and synchronous with the ventilator.
No further intervention was indicated at this time, per discussion with [**Hospital Unit Name 3242**].
