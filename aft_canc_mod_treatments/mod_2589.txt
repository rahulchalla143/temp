He was given Vanc and Meropenem.
Overnight in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he did well and in the a.m. of [**10-19**] he was called out to the floor as he was sating well on 2L NC which was back to baseline.
His sat had dropped to 69% with a good pleth on a non-rebreather.
A code was called and a plan was made to intubate- just prior to intubation while being bag-mask ventilated his O2 sat increased to 100% and then he was switched to a non rebreather and was feeling well.
Based on the sensitivities of the GNR, abx were changed to ceftaz.
On [**10-21**] he was started on bactrim for possible stenotrophomonas and carvedilol.
He was continued on IV bactrim.

Beta-glucan and galactomanan sent on presentation were negative.
He was continued on prednisone.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE - Creatinine rose steadily on IV bactrim, lasix, lisinopril.
Renal was consulted and felt that the creatinine rise was largely dut to the non-toxic effect of bactrim on creatinine absorbtion.
Lasix and acyclovir were held.
Renal consult team felt that the increased creatinine was due to the benign effect of bactrim on inhibiting tubular secretion of creatinine that would resolve following discontinuation of treatment.
Cr remained at 2.0-2.1 for 2 days following discontinuation of bactrim but then returned to 1.6 on discharge.
He was transfused to keep Hct > 25 and continued on immunosuppression with cellcept.

He was given two doses of vancomycin and started on a 5 day course of augmentin.
He did not require lasix to maintain volume status and this was held while his creatinine was elevated and there were no exam findings of volume overload.
He was discharged on his home dose of lasix with sheduled follow up in heart failure clinic.
