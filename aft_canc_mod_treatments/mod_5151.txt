Of note, the patient previously had a colonoscopy and endoscopy when he initially presented with GI bleed; neither of which were able to identify a source of bleeding, leading to capsule endoscopy.
He denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomitting, and hematemesis.
He does not use Ibuprofen and has stopped taking his daily ASA (although he is unsure when he stopped this medication).
The patient continues to be on heparin SQ for treatment of his DVT.

Brief Hospital Course: 81yo M w/ PMHx of CHF (EF <35% on [**5-17**] ECHO), recent DVT in left arm [**1-8**] PICC on heparin SQ and Fe-deficiency anemia w/ recent GI bleed last month who presents to the ED after capsule endoscopy showed active bleeding in small bowel for further management.
He was taken for small bowel endoscopy but the study was unrevealing, perhaps not reaching the area noted on the CT to be abnormal.
On admission, he was made NPO in anticipation for procedure by GI and continued on protonix 40mg IV q24hrs.
The procedure revealed a friable tissue mass consistent with distal small bowel tumor.
Surgery was consulted and discussed with the patient the possiblity of going to surgery for resection of the area.
The fact that this surgery would be palliative was explained to the patiend and his wife.
However, they wish to defer surgery at this time.
He received 3 units of PRBCs during this admission.
He should have his hematocrit checked at least twice weekly and should receive blood transfusions to maintain a goal hematocrit of 28 (unless he opts for hospice).
He was also seen by oncology who recommended surgery and noted that it was consistent with a palliative approach.
s/p biventricular pacer with EKG showing ventricular pacing.
At home, patient is on, lisinopril, metoprolol and torsemide.
These medications were initially held given his NPO status for procedure.
Metoprolol was restarted and titrated back up to his home dose prior to discharge (12.5 mg twice daily).
Lisinopril and torsemide were held as he appeared euvolemic and his blood pressure was normal in the 100's-110's systolic.
#HTN: As above, his home lisinopril and torsemide were held.
#h/o UE DVT: When discharged from hospitalization when he developed UE DVT, the patient was started on [**Hospital1 **] heparin injections for prophylaxis per Heme-Onc consult from last admission.
Appears that GI bleeding became an issue with the initiation of heparin therapy.
Per rehabilitation records, the patient has still been taking heparin SQ [**Hospital1 **].
Heparin was stopped in the setting of GI bleeding.
They recommended continuing SC heparin at 5,000 units twice daily until he makes further decisions about pursuing care versus pursuing comfort based approach.
This was discussed with the patient and with his wife.
The risk of holding heparin and resulting DVT and pulmonary embolism, potentially resulting in death, was explained to the patient.
The risk of giving heparin and likely continued oozing from his mass was also explained to the patient.
He opted to continue SC heparin for now.
Patient was started on heparin as an outpatient at 5000 units [**Hospital1 **].
Patient also started Linezolid and then was transitioned to Doxycycline, both of which can cause thrombocytopenia.
Doxycycline was continued for treatment of cardiac device vegetation.
Patient recently transitioned from Linezolid to doxycycline for treatment.
The patient should be continued on doxycycline.
#HLD: Patient's home statin was held.
However, he strongly desired transfer to a skilled nursing facility for continued rehabilitation and to be closer to his family.
