Admission Date:  [**2103-1-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2103-2-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2032-4-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**] Chief Complaint: 70 year old male with one month of increasing jaundice, pseudocyst of the pancreas on CT scan, in the background of alcoholism.
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Puestow procedure, cholecystectomy, feeding jejunostomy tube placement, central venous line placement.
He has been noncompliant with his treatment of diabetes for this year.
However, he was unable to be cannulated by ERCP and therefore he was referred to Dr. [**Name (NI) 60612**] care for a surgical evaluation.
I found him to be weak, malnourished and not suitable for an operation at the point that he was evaluated.
Furthermore, he suffered a GI bleed from his attempted sphincterotomy one week afterwards and was transfused many units of blood to resuscitate him.
In the interim, we provided TPN for nourishment and made him nil per os through this period of time.
The patient was made nil per os and was started on TPN as at the time of admission the patient was not physically prepared to withstand the rigors of a major abdominal procedure.
After preparing him with TPN for multiple weeks, the patient was ready for an operative intervention for relief of the bile duct.
They understood the risks and benefits of this operation and both wished to proceed and provided informed consent to that effect.
It was made very clear that he was at a heightened risk for perioperative complications primarily from anesthetic induction, but also from the operation itself, given his frail constitution.
The patient was brought to the operating room on the morning of [**2-6**] with the intent of performing a biliary bypass through a choledochojejunostomy as well as a drainage of the pancreatic pseudocyst.
Furthermore, a jejunostomy feeding tube was placed for postoperative nutritional support.
Also, in the operating room a right sided [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was placed that was later removed in the postoperative period.
In the postoperative period the patient was initially maintained on TPN until tube feeds were started.
The [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes service was consulted at this time and adjusted the doses of his insulin to better control his blood glucose.
In the days leading up to his discharge the patient was also started on a regular diabetic diet and was tolerating oral intake fairly well.
This limited his mobility though patient was able to work with physical therapy and was out of bed to chair consistently in the postoperative period.
In the postoperative period the patient was continued on all of his home medications and progressed well overall and on [**2103-2-19**] the patient was deemed fit for discharge to a rehabilitation facility with instructions to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks.
