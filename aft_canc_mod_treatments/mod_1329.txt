PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Bronchoalveolar carcinoma diagnosed in [**2109**], status post right lower lobe lobectomy times two in [**2111**] and [**2117**].
In [**2117**] received experimental protocol with lavage of T53 virus.
In [**2121**] started experimental phase two trials of Iressa until [**2122-6-6**] when this trial was stopped due to increased dyspnea on exertion and cough.
MEDICATIONS:  Allopurinol 300 mg p.o.
q.d., Toprol sustained release 50 mg p.o.
q.d., tolterodine 2 mg p.o.
q.d., indomethacin 50 mg p.o.
q.d., Solu-Medrol inhaler two puffs inhaled twice daily, Combivent inhaler two puffs inhaled four times daily.
Temperature 97.7, blood pressure 133/79, heart rate 95, respiratory rate 24, oxygen saturation 88% in room air to 95% on 6 liters nasal cannula.
He was treated with heparin and supportive care for hypoxia.
At many times during the hospital stay patient wished to be full code with resuscitation measures as necessary; at other times he wished to be do not resuscitate/do not intubate.
He was empirically treated with IV methylprednisolone, levofloxacin, trimethoprim sulfamethizole and nebulizers as well as IV heparin.
Mask ventilation did result in improvement in hypoxia while patient remained on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.
[**Name (NI) 6419**] felt that if thrombolytic therapy did not succeed and patient's hypoxia was likely to be continuous, then he would not wish to be intubated.
Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation eventually became quite uncomfortable for him and patient's family agreed to retreat to nonrebreather face mask therapy for patient's comfort.
IV morphine was administered, first in boluses and then by continuous infusion.
