Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE 54F with metastatic melanoma s/p treatment with ipilimumab with complicating hypophysitis presenting with fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain.
Pt recieved IVF and 1unit PRBC, but to minimal relief of symptoms of nausea and fatigue.
Patient's prednisone was increased from 5mg to 10mg to improvement of fatigue and nausea.
During admission patient was noted to have LLE DVT and started on subQ Lovenox.
Patient was discharged on day 12 of hospitalization with followup with Heme-Onc ([**2150-8-26**]), Endocrine ([**2150-8-25**]) and GI ([**2150-8-26**]).
Did not improve markedly after IVF and PRBC.
MRI negative for brain metastases.
Nausea was treated with Zofran and Reglan.
Patient has hypophysitis [**1-22**] previous treatment with ipilimumab for metastatic melanoma.
Patient's prednisone was increased from 5mg to 10mg to improvement of fatigue and nausea.
After increase in prednisone dosage, intermittent fevers resolved.
# LLE DVT: Found on LENI due to leg swelling.
Initially treated with Heparin gtt and then transitioned to Lovenox.
Due to patient obesity, Anti-Xa level was sent after third dose of Lovenox and found to be within acceptable limits.
After resolution of nausea and lethargy, patient began to take POs again and Lantus was again titrated.
Patient was discharged with followup with [**Hospital **] Clinic on [**2150-8-25**].
Pt with h/o aflutter s/p ablation seen by cardiology with persistent sinus tach on diltiazem.
Not much improvement after 1u pRBC transfusion [**8-13**], so does not seem to be related to anemia.
No evidence of DVT and holding off on CTA to r/o PE as pt had CTA a little over a week ago negative for PE.
Pt continued with HR in 100-110s on metop succinate 100mg QD.
# HYPOTENSION: One episode of SBPs down to 80s on [**8-13**], improved to SBPs 90s-120s with better HR control and s/p small IVF boluses.
# CONSTIPATION: Despite bowel regimen of docusate, senna, and miralax, patient was intermittently constipated throughout admission.
Patient sent home with prescriptions for docusate, senna, miralax and lactulose.
# Neuropathy: chronic likely [**1-22**] chemotherapy, continued neurontin # GERD: continued ranitidine  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # [**Month/Day (2) 269**] to visit patient for Lovenox teaching # f/u with GI for clinic evaluation in order to set up scope to evaluate of intestinal mets from melanoma as cause of guiac + stool ([**2150-8-26**]).
# f/u with OP oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ([**2150-8-26**]) # f/u with endocrine re: hypophysitis with adrenal insufficiency ([**2150-8-25**]) # f/u with [**Last Name (un) **] re: insulin dosage.
# Pt's iron supplementation discontinued on discharge as it was contributing to significant constipation and pt's anemia workup seems most c/w anemia of chronic disease so iron supplementation unlikely to help.

We gave you one unit of blood and fluids.
We changed your diltiazem to metoprolol to better control this.
We did a test to measure a hormone called cortisol and found it to be relatively low.
You should see your endocrinologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) to adjust your prednisone as needed.
