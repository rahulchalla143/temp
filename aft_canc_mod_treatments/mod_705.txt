Admission Date:  [**2129-1-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2129-2-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2059-6-24**]     Sex:  F  Service:  DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Status post partial gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y jejunogastrostomy, exploratory laparotomy, oversewing of gastrojej anastomosis, drainage of pancreatic ascites, reinsertion of J tube, repair of small bowel perforation.
ALT 17, AST 19, alkaline phosphatase 130, T bilirubin 1, calcium 8.7, magnesium 1.6, phosphate 4.1.
The patient underwent, on [**2129-1-14**], a partial gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y jejunogastrostomy, for adenocarcinoma of the stomach.
This operation was complicated by abdominal distention with CT finding of free air, although no evidence of leakage of contrast per CT. Because of the septic state of the patient, the patient was re-explored resulting in oversewing of gastrojej anastomosis and drainage of pancreatic ascites.
On [**2129-1-27**], the patient became uncooperative and removed the feeding jejunostomy voluntarily.
Secondarily, attempts to reinsert the J tube revealed a small bowel perforation which required reopening laparotomy, repair of small bowel, and reinsertion of the feeding jejunostomy.
Then, with aggressive physical therapy and nutritional support, the patient became fit enough for discharge to the rehab center on [**2129-2-24**].
