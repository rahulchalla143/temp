Brief Hospital Course: 60F w h/o cirrhosis, [**3-12**] PBC and autoimmune hepatitis, c/b HCC and diuretic resistant ascites, on transplant list, admitted with weakness and increasing ascites and found to have hyponatremia.
Hypertonic saline was given with improved sodium.
IV Lasix was started to augment tolvaptan.
PO Torsemide and fluid restriction continued.
Tolvaptan was stopped and salt tabs were given with sodium stable  Hematocrit had dropped from 25 to 20, requiring [**2-9**] units of PRBCs.
The patient underwent attempted TIPS without success and IR was not able to identify a bleeding vessel to embolize.
Seven days of vancomycin was given and UTI resolved.

Albumin was given post procedure, but creatinine began to rise from her baseline of 1.0.
The patient was started on albumin, midodrine, and octreotide for presumed hepatorenal syndrome vs. contrast induced nephropathy.
Doses of midodrine and octreotide were titrated up without effect.
