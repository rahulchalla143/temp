Bulky mediastinal, supraclavicular, and right hilar lymphadenopathy, concerning for lymphoma.
DIAGNOSIS: HIGH GRADE DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA WITH PLASMA CELL DIFFERENTIATION AND CYTOPLASMIC IMMUNOGLOBULIN CRYSTALS.
SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY.
A MIB-1 stain is difficult to assess do to the admixed nonneoplastic hemopoietic precursors, but is focally up to 30%.
Erythrocytes are slightly decreased in number with rouleaux formation, and show occasional target cells, ovalocytes, and polychromatophils with rare cells showing basophilic stippling.
Erythroid precursors are normal in number and show dyspoietic maturation, karyorrhectic nuclei, nuclear budding, and micronuclei.
The lymphocyte count includes many large and atypical cells with Golgi crystalline inclusions and fragments of lymphocytes in the background.
INTERPRETATION Immunophenotypic finding consistent with involvement by a lambda restricted B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.
Right PIC catheter can be traced as far as the superior cavoatrial junction.
A PICC line remains in place on the right.

He denied celiac type symptoms, but was kept on a gluten free diet throughout his hospital course.
On the day of discharge the patient was changed to a regular diet, per patient's request and after a discussion and investigation on this presumed wheat allergy.
