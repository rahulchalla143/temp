#[**2182-10-17**] UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.
A left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 656**] is a 88yo Russian-speaking man with a h/o CAD s/p quadruple bypass in [**2169**], IDDM, CRI, HTN, Afib A-paced, initially admitted for hypertensive urgency with the subsequent development of DKA, now with elevated troponin levels and minimal EKG changes from baseline without any chest pain.
hydralazine 25mg pushed and new BP was SBP 140s.
Patient was asymptomatic s/p hydralazine.
NSTEMI was treated w/ high dose ASA, high dose atorvatatin, heparin drip, and O2.
Pt had already gotten metoprolol that AM.
Patient was started on q1hr finger sticks with prn IV insulin, but with little effect as gap only closed to 20 and so it was determined that transfer to MICU for insulin drip management was prudent.
While in MICU, pt was observed and treated for DKA with insulin gtt.
Pt was then transferred to Cardiology for further management of NSTEMI.
Given that cardiac biomarkers still trending upward (Tn peaked 1.04, CK-MB peaked at 23), we proceeded with medically managing for NSTEMI vs Type 2 MI at this time: ASA 325mg daily, metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **], atorvastatin 80mg daily, heparin gtt (given for 48hrs) and discharged on plavix 75 daily.
His anatomy (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM2, SVG to RPDA, SVG to RPL) was obtained from [**Hospital1 2177**] records.
# DKA/DM: Gap closed after fluid administration prior to admission to MICU.
His blood pressures were better controlled with lisinopril 40 daily, coreg 25 [**Hospital1 **], amlodipine 5 mg po qdaily and chlorthalidone 25 daily.
Switched metoprolol to carvedilol to control BP's.
Anticoagulation was not started with concern for fall.
Recommend 24 hr urine metanephrines and serum renin and aldosterone as outpatient with refractory hypertension.
