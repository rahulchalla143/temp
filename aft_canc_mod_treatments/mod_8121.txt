Esophageal stent appears in satisfactory position, unchanged from previously.
The right-sided PICC line and the esophageal stent are in unchanged position.
Stable thoracic esophageal stent with distal esophageal fullness consistent with history of esophageal carcinoma.
If clinically indicated, a TEE is suggested to exclude endocardits and to better assess mitral/tricuspid anatomy and degrees of valve regurgitation.
A right hilar node measures 9 mm with an SUV max of 3.96 (image 65).
A right paratracheal node measures 8 mm with an SUV max of 3.22 (image 60).
A precarinal node measures 4 mm with an SUV max of 2.47 (image 64).
Residual FDG-avidity around the esophageal stent may be due to residual disease, particularly the focus in the mid stent region with an SUV max of 6.87.
Small focus of low-level FDG-activity at the right lung base is likely aspiration or inflammation.

He was deemed to not be a surgical candidate for his cancer by Thoracic Surgery Tumor board so was started on cycle 3 of chemotherapy.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Stage III-IV SCC of the esophagus: S/p 2 cycles of cisplatin and 5-FU as well as 28-day cycle of radiation..
After the repeat PET scan, thoracic surgery reconsulted and discussed his case at tumor board.
His pain regimen was been titrated with standing oxycodone po, since his difficulty swallowing pills has prevented MSContin and his cachectic body habitus and intermittent fevers prevented fentanyl.
# Sepsis: Fevers, altered mental status, and hypotension required ICU admission on his presentation.
Patient has history of multiple organisms found on blood culture during last admission, but none were isolated on current admission.
PICC line was at one point removed (later replaced).
Final regimen chosen was vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]/fluc on [**11-25**] without true fever since then.
Fever after failed PICC placement (see below) may have been due to hematoma inflammatory reaction.
# Failed Right PICC placement on [**12-5**]: In advance of planned discharge, during bedside PICC placement patient's artery was punctured and he developed a large hematoma in his right arm.
He went for IR guided PICC line in his left arm subsequently without complications.
Initially fluid-responsive, likely due to hypovolemia, but once euvolemic managed with salt tabs, free-water restriction with encouraged high electrolyte diet,and concentrated tube feeds with TwoCal HN.
Was started on Paroxetine for his symptoms.
Controlled with banana flakes in his tube feeds.
# G-tube site: Starting [**11-13**], skin site developed minor 2-3mm erythema, induration, and some thin white-yellow discharge.
Provided wound care with cleanses and dressing changes.
Tube was then clogged, replaced by Thoracic surgery [**11-21**].
eccentric MR jet, moderate (2+) MR.
Recently seen by cardiology and felt there is no indication for medications at this time given normal LV function.
He is considered to be stable for surgery and chemo as needed.
Pischarged patient on daily magnesium oxide 400mg crushable for G-tube delivery and outpatient lab followup.
CHRONIC ISSUES # BPH: No urinary issues off doxazosin, held earlier in the setting of hypotension Continued tamsulosin  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 1) Esophageal carcinoma: Further outpatient management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
