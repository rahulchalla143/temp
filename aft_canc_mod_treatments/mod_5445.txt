PATHOLOGY: [**2112-10-15**] SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: right colon, retro-peritoneal tissue, section transverse colon, omemtum.
Right ileocolectomy specimen (A-Q): Subacute/interval appendicitis with severe periappendicitis, periappendiceal/cecal abscess formation, and fecal material consistent with perforation.
Unremarkable segment of ileum and proximal resection margin.
Retroperitoneal tissue (R): Fibroadipose tissue with acute and chronic inflammation, necrosis, and granulation tissue and abscess formation.
DIAGNOSIS:  Soft tissue, right thigh, excision: Fibroadipose tissue with acute and chronic inflammation, fat necrosis, and granulation tissue.
Note:  Although no organisms were identified on special stain (GMS, PAS-D, Gram), the findings, along with the clinical history, favor a diagnosis of panniculitis, most likely due to infectious etiologies.
New placement of a transgastric feeding jejunostomy tube in good position as well as a right retroperitoneal drain.
This could be clarified with a non- urgent renal son[**Name (NI) **].
[**2112-10-20**] US EXTREMITY NONVASCULAR RIGHT: Two fluid collections in the deep subcutaneous tissues of the medial thigh as described above.
This finding could be followed with MRI on a non-emergent basis.

Given the emergent nature of the patient's presentation, he was taken to the Operating Room on [**2112-10-15**], where the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, right colectomy, ileal colostomy retroperitoneal abscess drainage, drain placement, transgastric feeding jejunostomy, which went well (reader referred to the Operative Note for details).
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient was transferred to the TICU NPO with an NG tube, intubated on mechanical ventilation, on IV fluids and IV Zosyn, Vancomycin, and Fluconazole; with a foley catheter, JP drains x2, CVL, A-Line, and a G-J tube in place; and a Fentanyl drip for pain control.
NEURO/PAIN: Post-operatively when in an ICU setting, the patient initially received Fentanyl by IV infusion or IV PRN with good effect.
Prior to VAC dressing changes, the patient was given Dilaudid 2mg IV, which worked well.
At the time of admission, ECG revealed afib with PACs successfully treated with Metoprolol 5mg IV Q6Hours PRN, which also controlled hypertension.
On [**2112-11-5**], the patient experienced [**11-5**] abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting,he was made NPO and tubefeeds were stopped, he was triggered for a sustained heart rate in 130s, an EKG revealed Afib with RVR.
He received 1 unit PRBCs for a HCT of 22 and IV fluid rescusitation with good effect.
On [**2112-11-11**], the patient underwent ultrasound-guided puncture of left brachial artery, second-order catheterization of superior mesenteric artery, abdominal aortogram, selective superior mesenteric arteriogram showing 70-80% stenosis of SMA, and primary stenting of superior mesenteric artery for stenoses for chronic mesenteric ischemia, which went well without complication.
Plavix was restarted.
A statin and ASA were started prior to discharge.
PULMONARY: Post-operatively, the patient was maintained on mechanical ventilation until [**2112-10-30**], at which time he was extubated after being weaned and placed on supplemental oxygen by face mask.
He was transitioned to supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula and subsequently weaned off supplemental oxygen entirley.
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizer treatments were administered as needed with good effect.
The patient received TPN via a PICC line starting from [**2112-10-31**] until [**2112-11-15**], afterwhich it was discontinued.
Tubefeeds via the J-port of the G-J tube were initiated as early as [**2112-10-18**], and progressively advanced to cycled tubefeeds with Replete with Fiber Full Strength at 100mL/Hr by [**2112-10-27**].
The patient was emergently brought to the Operating Room, where he underwent exploratory laparotomy, which was negative, lysis of adhesions, right retroperitoneal drain removal, intra-abdominal drain placement, and subcutaneous drain placement (see Operative Note).
Post-operatively, trophic tubefeeds were gently re-initiated using 1/2 strength Replete.
By discharge, the patient was tolerating a low sodium, heart healthy regulr diet, albeit with only fair intake.
He received IV fluid boluses when needed, including a 1 liter LR fluid bolus on [**2112-11-18**] and maintenence IV fluid over [**11-19**] and [**11-20**] for poor oral intake.
By [**2112-11-21**], the patient was tolerating the tubefeeds via the G-tube, was tolerating his diet with improved intake, and no longer required IV fluids.
He required pressors after his frst surgery on [**2112-10-15**].
He responded well to IV fluid rescusitation on a number of occassions during this admission with good urine output.
After his multiple surgical interventions, he required placement of a foley catheter.
By discharge, his renal functions had essentially normalized with a BUN/creatinine of 19/0.9, respectively.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE/INTEG: After surgery on [**2112-10-15**], the patient had a midline incision with staples which remained clean and intact.
On [**2112-10-19**], the patient was brought to the OR for right flank abscess incision and drainage, complex debridement of full-thickness skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascia, and pulse lavage for a right flank abscess with soft tissue necrosis.
The dressings were changed every third day with progressive improvement and development of new granualtion tissue.
All JP drains were discontinued.
VAC dressings were continued when the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility.
After surgery on [**2112-10-15**], the patient was started on IV Fluconazole in addition to IV Zosyn an Vancomycin, which were continued from [**Hospital3 3583**].
IV Fluconazole was discontinued on [**2112-10-21**] as preliminary findings revealed no fungus.
IV Zosyn and Vancomycin were continued until [**2112-11-8**].
Vancomycin trough levels and renal functions were monitored closely during the admission, and IV Zosyn and Vancomycin dosages adjusted accordingly.
Exogenous insulin was not required at discharge.
PROPHYLAXIS: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay; he was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as possible with assistance.
He was discharged on Plavix and ASA.
The patient was tolerating a low sodium regular diet with improved intake and tubefeeds at goal via the G-port of the G-J tube with the J-port clamped, ambulating with assistance, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
Prior to discharge, the VAC dressings were taken down, and moist-to-dry dressings placed for transport.
VAC dressings to the right flank/back and right thigh/groin will be replaced at the rehabilitation facility and continued.
