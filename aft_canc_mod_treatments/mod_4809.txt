The patient had an open cholecystectomy on [**2129-8-19**] complicated by injury to the common bile duct.
The right and left hepatic ducts were clipped and a drain placed.
The patient had persistent bile leak and was sent to IR for guided biliary drain placement.
Complicated by sepsis, the patient was treated with IV ceftazidime and gentamicin.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Amlodipine 5 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Dulcolax 10 mg p.o.
once daily p.r.n., ceftazidime 1 gram q.24 hours, Colace 100 mg p.o.
b.i.d., gentamicin 60 mg q.12h., heparin IV at 1450 U/h, Maalox [**1-24**] tbsp p.r.n.
q.6h., Milk of Magnesia 30 mL p.o.
once daily, Megace 800 mg p.o.
once daily, Toprol XL 100 mg p.o.
once daily, oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o.
q.6h., and Senokot 2 tabs p.o.
Abdomen was soft, nondistended, right upper quadrant tenderness, positive bowel sounds, capped biliary drain, and a healed open cholecystectomy scar.
Tube feed recommendations were recommended due to patient's risk for decreased p.o.
The patient was started on Unasyn 1.5 grams IV q.8h.
Gentamicin was stopped.
Patient had a left percutaneous transhepatic catheter present.
A new 12 French biliary drain was placed over the wire, and the wire was removed.
Thrombosis of the right portal vein with a nonocclusive thrombus was seen within the proximal left portal vein with involvement of segment [**Doctor First Name 690**] and IVb and proximal segment III involvement.
A clip was noted at the base of the left hepatic duct, as well as a clip at the base of the right hepatic duct, and a third clip just distal to the common hepatic duct which was not seen.
An external-internal drainage catheter was seen entering the periphery of the left lobe of the liver, coursing within a left hepatic duct prior to exiting the intrahepatic biliary system, then coursing through the hilum of the liver and directly entering the duodenal bulb.
On [**2129-10-27**], he underwent a CT-guided drainage of the subphrenic collection.
There was successful CT-guided drainage, and a catheter placed within the right subphrenic/perihepatic collection.
The patient was given oxycodone for pain on the right side of his abdomen.
He was maintained on IV heparin.
On [**2129-11-1**], a nasointestinal tube was placed, and tube feedings were started.
Recommendations included renally dosing all medications with avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs.
Patient was started on a renal diet.
He was transfused with 2 units of packed cells on [**10-27**].
He did experience some diarrhea after starting his tube feedings.
He was maintained on IV normal saline for hydration.
Tube feeds were cycled using Novasource Pulmonary at 70 cc/h x12h.
This demonstrated a 10 x 4 cm subcapsular right hepatic collection containing the drainage catheter, essentially unchanged in appearance.
Patient's blood was sent for heparin antibody.
Heparin had been stopped prior to the return of the result.
He was placed on lepirudin at 0.15/h.
On [**2129-11-3**], he underwent a PICC placement with satisfactory position in the mid SVC.
After 11 days of Unasyn, the patient was switched to oral ciprofloxacin.
The pigtail drain was draining approximately 25 cc/D.
Patient was progressing well with physical therapy.
On [**2129-11-9**], he underwent abdominal CT with contrast to evaluate for intraperitoneal bleeding.
The right hepatic collection containing the drainage catheter was largely unchanged in appearance, and again a moderate to large right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis was unchanged.
Patient was preopped for right hepatic resection with right nephrectomy for bile duct injury and renal cell carcinoma, right portal vein thrombosis and right hepatic vein thrombosis.
Under general anesthesia, he underwent right hepatic lobectomy, repair of duodenum with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] patch, a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy over a 12 French Silastic catheter, a right radical nephrectomy with evacuation of a subphrenic hematoma, and Tru- Cut biopsy of the left lobe of the liver.
Patient received 14.4 liters of crystalloid, 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, and 6 units of packed red blood cells.
