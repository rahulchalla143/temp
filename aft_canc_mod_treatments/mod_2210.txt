Admission Date:  [**2193-1-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2193-2-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2154-6-8**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Cefepime / Aztreonam / Levaquin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**] Chief Complaint: Reinduction MEC therapy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 38-year-old Chinese-speaking female with a history of secondary AML from her treatment for breast cancer, is currently day 165 status post allogeneic stem cell transplant from an unrelated donor for TBI and Cytoxan for conditioning regimen.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] had been on lamivudine prophylactically.
She was rapidly tapered off immunosuppression in order to stimulate the donor T cells to hopefully initiated graft versus leukemia effect.
She has had no clear evidence of GVH at this time, did develop a maculopapular rash and spotty areas around the neck, back, torso, arms, and legs, which was very pruritic, was evaluated by dermatology who thought that perhaps it was an eczematous process possibly brought on by MRI contrast and was not thought to be GVH, treated empirically initially with Lidex ointment and then switched to triamcinolone cream with almost complete resolution of the rash.
She has required periodic blood and platelet support since her relapse.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Secondary AML 11q23 mutation breast CA Graves' disease status post radioactive iodine treatment on [**2190-9-14**] with subsequent hypothyroidism.
(LVI negative, ER positive, HER-2/neu negative) She underwent wide excision with sentinel lymph node procedure on the right along with wide excision of the left breast.
She also received four cycles of Adriamycin and Cytoxan chemotherapy (completed in [**2190-11-3**]).
Tamoxifen was initiated in [**2191-2-1**] though was taken off at time of diagnosis of AML.
Marrow clot section is not submitted.
The patient received 5 days of MEC therapy which she tolerated well.
She has been pancytopenic and has required platelet and blood transfusions to keep her crit > 25 and plt > [**9-21**].
DLI was not given after the patient became hemodynamically unstable [**1-4**] pericardial tamponade and bilateral pulmonary edema.
A decision was made to make the patient comfort measures and not pursue further aggressive treatment given worsening bilateral pleural effusions and persistent tamponade in the setting of disease recurrence.
Patient remained neutropenic thoughout this admission and started to spike fever >102 on [**1-15**] and was started on vancomycin and meropenem.
She was already on fluconazole and acyclovir already for prophylaxis given her neutropenia.
She was taken off meropenem and started on gentamicin.
On [**1-26**] gentamycin was stopped and meropenem was restarted to better cover gram negative bacteria as the patient was still spiking fevers.
The patient was switched briefly to Aztreonam but this too worsened her rash and she was switched back to Gentamicin for gram negative coverage.
Her left subclavian line was discontinued given that it was thought to be contributing to her fevers but the patient continued to spike despite the line being removed.
Voriconazole was added for empiric fungal coverage.
Voriconazole was switched to Posaconazole for mucor coverage by ID recommendation and switching Vancomycin to Daptomycin to avoid renal toxicity.
A discussion with the patient and her family was held and a decision was made to make the patient comfort care given her aggressive disease and worsening clinical course with worsening respiratory distress from her pulmonary edema and pericardial tamponade.
She was given standing Tylenol to prevent fevers and make the patient comfortable.
# Skin rash- Thought to be due to meropenem which was stopped [**1-23**] and restarted on [**1-26**] for better gram neg coverage as she was still spiking temps.
She was given Triamcinolone cream for symptomatic relief and the rash slowly improved when she was switched off Meropenem/Aztreonam to Gentamicin.
# Mucositis- Patient developed mucositis after reinduction with MEC.
She was also being covered for viral and fungal causes with fluconazole and acyclovir.
The fluconazole was switched to caspofungin when she was still spiking fevers.
Her pain was well-controlled with a fentanyl pca and improved during her stay.
Patient was start on TPN since it was difficult for her to eat [**1-4**] mouth pain.
# History of Hep B positive donor- Continued prophylaxis with lamivudine.
Her Hepatitis B viral load was negative.
# Epistaxis- This occured in setting of plt count < 20 K. She was given plts to keep goal > 35,000 and afrin nasal spray.
Ambisome was added for empiric fungal coverage.
The patient was eventually placed on a Fentanyl gtt for respiratory distress and made comfortable.
Concurrently, a large pericardial effusion was identified with tamponade physiology and worsening pulmonary edema.
Medications on Admission: levothyroxine lamivudine  Discharge Medications: N/A  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary 1.
