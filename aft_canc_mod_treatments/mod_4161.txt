Brief Hospital Course: AML M5a: She was admitted and started on a low dose Ara C + hydrea protocol + GM-CSF x 14 days for her AML.
She had a slow decline in respiratory function in the setting of DIC and initiation of chemotherapy, and was transferred to the ICU for noninvasive ventilation and diuresis.
Her hct and platelets were supplemented as needed with transfusions to keep her hct > 25 and platelets > 10.
The mucositis was treated with gelclear, viscous lidocaine and eventually liquid roxicet, and she was placed on TPN.
Radiation oncology was consulted and she was started on dexamethasone and a 10-course treatment of whole brain radiation.
Her last CBC showed WBC 13.6 (elevation thought to be due to steroids), Hct 33.1 and Platelets differential showed Her mucositis resolved, and her TPN was weaned off and eventually d/c'ed.
There, she was treated for her pneumonia with vancomycin, flagyl and levofloxacin, placed on noninvasive ventilation to decrease her afterload and preload, and she was diuresed gently given her ARF with lasix.
She was initially tried on a CCB for afterload reduction, but was eventually switched over to atenolol 25 mg PO QD.
Due to her bad mucositis, she was placed on TPN and her medications were made IV.
As her RF resolved, she was aggressively diuresed with 20 mg IV lasix QD.
Her baseline weight at discharge was 134 lbs.
She then developed a second UE DVT due to a PICC line in her right arm, which was also not treated due to low platelets.
After aggressive diuresis for her CHF, her Cr increased back up to 1.2, but resolved with some fluids and the discontinuation of her diuretics.
She was given cyroprecipitate to increase her fibrinogen to 100 and FFP for procedures.
Her DIC resolved after her treatment with AraC and hydrea.
Coagulase negative staph line infection - She developed an infection of her PICC line during her hospital course.
As she had hearing loss with vancomycin previously, she was treated with daptomycin.
The line was d/c'ed and she has finished a 10 day course of daptomycin since rebound of her ANC to > 500, as recommended by ID.
A foley was placed, and later d/c'ed as her strength recovered.
If she continues to have incontinence, a barrier cream should be applied to her perineal area to avoid infection.
Nutrition - Due to bad mucositis, she was placed on TPN during her admission.
