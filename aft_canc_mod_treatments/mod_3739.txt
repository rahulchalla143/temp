Bronchoscopy would be helpful for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.
Given the patient's co-morbid conditions (including CKD), held off on catheterization and decision was made to pursue medical management only.
A head CT was obtained to evaluate for brain mets and after this returned negative, a heparin gtt was started.
Aspirin and statin were continued.
Given these finding, plan for 1 month of anticoagulation with coumadin was planned (no longer given the patient's history of a SDH and a GI bleed).
Atorvastatin was increased from 10mg daily to 40mg daily.
On discharge the patient was bridged to coumadin with lovenox.
He had a small bump in his Cr to 1.6 in the setting of diuresis which then trended down and remained stable.
No further management was done while an inpatient.
IP was consulted for possible bronch +/- stenting vs thoracentesis.
It was felt that the patient would not tolerate a significant procedure including general anesthesia and therefore a rigid bronch and stent was not pursued.
During his hospital stay the patient had a significant oxygen requirement with O2 sats 88-96% on 6L NC and 15L high flow oxygen.
A large volume thoracentesis was performed on [**4-16**] by IP and 2.5L of fluid were removed.
He was able to be weaned off of the high flow oxygen and maintained on 6L NC.
His effusion quickly reaccumulated and the patient was taken for pleurex catheter placement on [**4-20**] for further drainage.
Following drainage he was maintained comfortably on 4L of 02 by nasal canula.
Presented on moxiflox, which was changed to levofloxacin during the hospitalization.
The patient required 6 liters of oxygen to keep sats above 90 (which was stable from pre-admission).
Mitral valve replacement with severe MR: Audible murmur on exam.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Flovent and atrovent nebs were used, along with oxygen to keep sats in the 91-93 range.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Location (un) 1110**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: ST elevation myocardial infarction adenocarcinoma of the lung hypertension atrial fibrillation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease hyperlipidemia hypothyroidism chronic renal insufficiency secondary: history of gastrointestinal bleeding history of subdural hemmorhage history of mitral valve replacement   Discharge Condition: fair, shortness of breath improved.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for a myocardial infarction you are being treated medically for this, it is important for you to continue to take your medications as prescribed.
A pleurex catheter was placed because of your re-occuring right pleural effusion.
This will need to be drained intermittently - the stitches at the location of the tunnel will need to be removed in 10 days after placement of the pleurex catheter, The stitches around the catheter should stay in.
You were started on anticoagulation with coumadin which you should continue to take for a period of 1 month.
