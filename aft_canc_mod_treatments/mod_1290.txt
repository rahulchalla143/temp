Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: L PICC line placement pRBC transfusions Lumbar Puncture   History of Present Illness: 75yo man with h/o metastatic prostate ca, status post chemotherapy and XRT in [**2118**] and [**2119**], on Lupron, dementia, EtOH aubse, transferred from NH [**2126-5-17**] for evaluation of leukocytosis (WBC 18.9) and ARF (Creat 1.7).
Patient initially diagnosed with RML pneumonia and hyperanatremia for which he was being treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and 1/2NS hydration.
He was treated with lorazepam 4mg iv and Dilantin load.
He was initially treate with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for presume community acquired pneumonia.
Antibiotic coverage expanded to include vancomycin, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir as empiric treatment for meningitis.
He was admitted to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital [**12/2125**] for agitated behavior and started on Depakote at that time.
Past Medical History: -prostate ca adenoca s/p radical prostatectomy, neoadjuvant chemotx -shingles -Bilateral total hip replacement (Lx2, Rx1) -Lower back pain from T5/T7 fx -s/p head trauma in MVA in past   Social History: FHx: unknown .

[**5-22**]: Renal ultrasound: The right kidney measures 9.3 cm.
The left kidney measures 9.4 cm.
There is again noted a complex cystic structure in the upper pole of the left kidney which could not be completely evaluated in this study due to inability of the patient to hold the breath.
[**5-23**]: CXR: Nasogastric tube and right subclavian central venous catheter remain in standard positions.
Band like increased uptake greater at T12 and new at T10 is most compatible with progression and development of osteoporotic compression fractures, respectively.
Focal increased uptake at right maxilla, more notable on today's exam; findings would be unusual for site of metastasis and may relate to sinus inflammatory disease.
Continued followup is required after treatment to assess resolution.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P:  76 yo M with h/o metastatic prostate cancer and dementia admitted with leukocytosis, ARF, RML pneumonia, and hypernatremia, transferred to MICU with ?seizure, unresponsiveness and thrombocytopenia.
Neurology followed, and he was treated with Dilantin.
He was initially treated empirically for meningitis, but the antimicrobials were discontinued as studies of the CSF, culture and HSV PCR, returned negative.
His remained responsive only to pain for many days, and this was felt to be due to drug toxicity given high dose of Dilantin and Ativan administered to break his seizure.
While on the floor he had no further episodes of seizures, was followed by neurology who recommended eventual breidge over to keppra given pt's elevated LFTS [**1-10**] acute cholecystitis.
Could not be begun on valproic acid [**1-10**] thrombocytopenia.
2)  PNA:  On transfer pt c fever, leukocytosis which was thought to be due to infection, found to have bilateral pneumonia that was treated with vancomycin, azitrhomycin, and ceftriaxone.
loculated, and that risks outweighted benefits of thoracocentesis in pt with thrombocytopenia, small pleural effusion, and acutely ill. Placed on Vancomycin and Meropenem for treatment of PNA.
Towards the end of hospital course, pt became increasingly wheezy on exam, placed on albuterol/atrovent nebs.
He continued to require multiple transfusions of pRBCs to maintain Hct > 25. .
he was followed by Oncology service, but was not treated for his malignancy.
Had hypercalemia during hospital course, likely secondary to bone mets, given Pamidronate 90 mg IV.
He was started on Flagyl, already on Vancomycin and Meropenem for PNA as above.
Placed on TPN for nutrional needs.
7)  ARF: On admission, thought to be prerenal initially in setting of decreased po intake but FENA on admission was >1%, raising concern for intrarenal process, ATN vs TTP vs AIN.
Vancomycin was dosed by trough < 15.
Lasix was held given ARF, dosed carefully by i/os and cardiopulmonary exam.
IVF and pamidronate given c improvement.
11) Mastoiditis/sphenoid sinusitis: Placed on Flagyl X 3 days for treatment of mastoiditis/sphenoid sinusitis.
NGT was d/c'd and nasal saline spray was initiated as per ENT.
14) FEN:  An NG tube was placed and tubefeed initiated when pt c AMS s/p seizure.
NGT was d/c'd upon diagnosis of mastoiditis as per ENT, PEG placement discussed c GI and nutrition, risks determined to outweight benefits of PEG in pt due to active infection, thrombocytopenia.
The pt had  PICC line placed and TPN was initiated .
