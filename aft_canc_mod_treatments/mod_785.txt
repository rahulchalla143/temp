EKG was notable for low-voltage, however bedside echo done in the ED did not show a pericardial effusion/tamponade physiology.
While in the ED, her BP decreased transiently to 78/44 after receiving 0.5 mg IV dilaudid (given for back pain), increased to 90's systolic with 2 L NS.
Both CT surgery and IP were consulted and bilateral chest tubes were placed in the ED by CT surgery.
Past Medical History: - Multiple myeloma stage III with amyloidosis dx'd in [**2142**], s/p  melphalan, and prednisone and then VAD x 4 cycles followed by auto BMT and subsequent Thalidomide.
Treated with cytoxan x1, dexamethasone x4 days.
[**2151-9-20**] marrow biopsy showing maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and lambda light chain restricted plasmacytosis c/w multiple myeloma, amyloid also present [**2151-9-29**] free serum kappa/lambda ratio 0.03.
- s/p 3 episodes of epiglottitis/supraglottitis requiring intubation in [**2145**], [**2149**], [**3-2**] - Amyloidosis - involvement of lungs, tongue, bladder, heart - CKD - thought secondary to disease progression - Diastolic dysfunction- likely secondary amyloid - h/o multiple DVT's (L IJ, L popliteal, L sup femoral)-IVC filter, due to R sided DVT propagation; on coumadin intermittently (due to fluctuating platelet counts on Velcade) - Osteopenia s/p Zometa infusions - HTN - s/p tonsillectomy - Hx of disseminated herpes in [**2146**] - Urge incontinence - Subdural hemorrhages in [**2-/2151**] in the setting of elevated INR   Social History: She is married and lives in [**Location 3786**], 2 children, one grandson.
b/l chest tubes in place.
A right-sided hemodialysis catheter is in place with tip projecting over the right atrium.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette and retrocardiac air-fluid structure likely representing hiatal hernia are both unchanged.
Right central venous catheter position unchanged.
colonoscopy [**1-28**] Findings:  Mucosa: The colonic mucosa was hyperemic with increased vascularity throughout but with a predominance on the left.
Protruding Lesions Medium non-bleeding internal hemorrhoids were noted.
Please wait 24 hours before beginning anticoagulation because biopsies were taken.
# Respiratory distress - both hypoxic and hypercarbic, [**2-26**] secondary spontaneous PTX.
She had bilateral chest tubes placed by CT surgery on admission.
She was also covered with broad spectrum antibiotics(vanco/zosyn), and was treated with IV bactrim and steroids for PCP.
Subsequently her Bactrim was decreased to prophylaxis dose and her steroids were discontinued.
Her antibiotics were discontinued on [**12-28**] after her BAL cultures returned negative.
She had her L chest tube removed on [**12-28**] and her R chest tube removed on [**12-29**].
She subsequently received a four day course of chemotherapy and on [**1-7**] developed worsening shortness of breath and desats to mid 80s with ambulation.
The thoracic surgery team was called and placed a chest tube the same day with over 600cc of initial drainage.
She did initially improve with chest tube in place and had a talc pleurodesis performed on [**1-10**].
She was started on IV Vancomycin and Cefepime for presumptive treatment of pneumonia.
Upon return to the floor, she continued to have an O2 requirement of 4-5L to maintain O2 sats as well as dyspnea on exertion.
She was again evaluated by thoracics who declined to place a chest tube as the PTX naturally reabsorbed over the next 48 hours.
She was discharged on coumadin for anticoagulation for her history of multiple DVTs and anticipation of thalidomide treatment.
Patient was initially treated with levophed for low BPs.
However, it was discovered with placement of an a-line that patient's invasive BP readings were ~10-20 mmHg higher than her noninvasive cuff readings.
It was also reported by her nephrologist that she typically has SBPs in the 80s or lower while on dialysis but always mentates without evidence of hypoperfusion.
# CKD on HD - on HD T/Th/Sa, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**].
She received 10 mg of po midodrine prior to HD for relative hypotension and tolerated ultrafiltration well.
She was intially treated with sevelamer which was changed to phoslo given relatively low serum calcium.
She received HD on Tues,Thurs,Sat while on the floor.
Her Hct remained stable for the remainder of her MICU course following transfusion until [**1-23**].
An intravenous PPI was started and she received DDAVP.
However, in light of necessity of anticoagulation colonoscopy was performed and showed hypervascularity in parts of the colon but no obvious source of bleeding.
Biopsies were taken and anticoagulation was started the following day.
# Multiple Myeloma w/amyloidosis - s/p cycle 4 of velcade/cytoxan/decadron the day prior to admission.
Received pentamidine on the same day for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
As above, her prophylaxis was changed to bactrim during hospitalization.
# h/o multiple DVTs - has been on and off coumadin intermittently due to fluctuating platelet counts while on Velcade.
She was restarted on coumadin 1 day prior to admission but this was held in the setting of chest tube placements.
Upon transfer to the Heme/Onc floor, so was soon restarted on Coumadin but then held again with chest tube placement on [**1-7**].
She was started on IV heparin.
She remained on IV heparin until her lower GI bleed.
At that time her recently started coumadin and the IV heparin were discontinued.
# F/E/N -She was given tube feeds while intubated.
On call out from the MICU she was tolerating a dysphagia diet.
Upon arrival to the floor she did well with a regular, low sodium diet .

You had a colonoscopy that showed an increased number of blood vessels in part of your colon but no obvious source of bleeding.
When you leave the hospital you should take all medications as prescribed.
You should continue to receive dialysis on Tues, Thurs, Sat as previously scheduled and follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**].
Be sure to confirm with him your medications that you take for your kidneys.
