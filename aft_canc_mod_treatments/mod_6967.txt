Redo left thoracotomy with completion left lower lobectomy, Pedicle intercostal muscle flap, Mediastinal lymph nodal dissection.
History of Present Illness: 54-year-old woman who underwent radiation in [**2123**] for Hodgkin lymphoma.
She subsequently developed 1.5 cm adenocarcinoma of left lower lobe which was treated with a left thoracotomy and wedge excision by my partner, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 175**], on [**2140-11-15**].
A wedge excision rather than a lobectomy was performed due to the fibrosis of the hilum associated with the prior mediastinal radiation.
Routine followup imaging for both her lung cancer and her lymphoma demonstrated new 1.5-cm nodule along the staple line which is FDG-avid.
She underwent preoperative evaluation, including pulmonary function tests, which demonstrated reasonable lung function.
