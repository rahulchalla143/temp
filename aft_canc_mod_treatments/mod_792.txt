Patient was given ceftriaxone and azithromycin and 2.7L IVF.
Bipap [**7-9**].
She was taken off of bipap and put on a NRB but became more tachypneic so was put back on bipap.
[**2152-3-29**] Legionella Urinary Antigen NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
LABS ON DISCHARGE: [**2152-4-10**] WBC 15.6, Hb 10.1, Hct 30.1, Plt 1011 PMN 86.6, Lymphs 9.5, Monos 2.8, Eos 0.9, Baso 0.2 Na 138/K 4.5, Cl 105/HCO3 26, BUN 17/Cr 0.6, Glu 101 Ca 8.4, Mg 1.9, P 3.8 PT 18.0, INR 1.6 Dig 0.8  RELEVANT IMAGING: [**2152-3-28**] CXR (on admission): Left lower lobe atelectasis and left pleural effusion; given the possible history of smoking, an obstructive neoplasm at the left hilum causing left lower lobe atelectasis and effusion cannot be excluded on this radiograph and is best further evaluated with a chest CT.  [**2152-4-8**] CXR (on discharge): There is background COPD with diffuse parenchymal scarring.
She was given 3L of intravenous fluids in the ED, and her oxygenation acutely worsened, requiring BiPap and transfer to the medical intensive care unit.
Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin were started for community acquired pneumonia.
Given the patient's lack of improvement and ongoing leukocytosis with bandemia, her antibiotics were broadened to Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Levofloxacin.
Interventional pulmonology performed a thoracentesis for concern of a paraneumonic effusion.
Interventional pulmonology felt that there would be little benefit from further interventions.
She was immediately started on diltazem gtt and loaded with digoxin for rate control.
She was transitioned to PO diltiazem and continued on digoxin.
The patient was started on coumadin for stroke prevention given a CHADS2 score of 2.
Her home lisinopril was held and not restarted on discharge given systolic blood pressures in the 90s-110s.
When stable, lisinopril can be restarted as an outpatient.
# PERSISTENT LEUKOCYTOSIS: The patient had persistent leukocytosis, prompting an additional workup for alternative infections.
CXR on [**2152-4-8**] prompted the thoracentesis described above.
# THROMBOCYTOSIS: The patient's platelets continued to rise, reaching 1011 on the day of discharge.
[**First Name (STitle) **], was contact[**Name (NI) **] about starting aspirin, and we elected not to start aspirin at this time given risk of bleeding wtih her new coumadin as well.
This was likely due to SIADH in the setting of her pulmonary processes and/or intravascular volume depletion in the setting of her acute systolic congestive heart failure and poor PO intake.
# CONTROLLED HYPERTENSION: Prior to admission, the patient took lisinopril for blood pressure control.
This medication was held in the setting of her acute kidney injury and subsequent systolic blood pressures in the 90s-110s from the initiation of diltiazem.
Lisinopril was not started on discharge but may be restarted as an outpatient.
# OSTEOPOROSIS: Restarted home calcium and vitamin D once she was taking POs.
She worked with physical therapy and was able to ambulate without assist with oxygen saturations above 90% on room air.
TRANSITIONS OF CARE: - WBCs and platelets should be followed as an outpatient.
- INR should be monitored for appropriate coumadin dosing.
- Lisinopril was not restarted given SBPs 90s-110s.
- Pt should get scripts for 2.5 mg of coumadin as well at her follow up appointment for ease of dosing per the [**Hospital **] clinic.

You will continue to take the digoxin and metoprolol as directed when you leave the hospital.
You were also started on coumadin to make your blood less likely to clot and to decrease the risk of stroke related to clotting that can occur in people with atrial fibrillation.
You will also continue to take coumadin as directed and have your blood drawn to make sure that your INR (a measure of anti-coagulation) is within the appropriate range.
Your creatinine value normalized during your hospitalization and continued to remain normal throughout your hospital stay.
START taking metoprolol 50mg three times per day.
