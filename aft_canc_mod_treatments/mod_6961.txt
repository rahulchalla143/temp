Increased size of pleural effusions, ascites and diffuse anasarca.
Findings may be related to acute on chronic pancreatitis, however exclusion of an underlying neoplasm is recommended.
Slightly thickened and edematous duodenum and jejunum may be from duodenitis/jejunitis versus third spacing.
Unchanged appearance of the right PICC line    Brief Hospital Course: 64 yo male with hx of ETOH, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tears and fatty liver p/w weakness at home with associated poor PO intake initially admitted to the MICU with hypotension requiring pressor support.
He was dependent on three pressors and persistently hypoxemic and acidemic despite ventilatory support, showing signs of multi-organ system failure.
# Hypotension/Shock- Patient noted to have hypotension of unclear etiology which has failed to improve with the administration of IVF and initially requiring pressor support on admission.
The patient does have a history of hypothyroidism but reports compliance with levothyroxine therapy.
The patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated during his ICU course, with a total net positive of almost 18L, and weaned off of pressors but despite this he continued to have low SBPs in the 80-90 range with low measured CVPs.
Adrenal insufficiency was entertained as a diagnosis, however his cortisol was wnl and there was no mention of atrophic adrenal glands on his CT scan, and on a trial of hydrocortisone his BPs were minimally responsive, if at all.
Hypothyroid contributing to his picture is a possibility, however his TSH is minimally elevated and he has been stable on his dose of thyroid replacement for quite some time.
He was empirically started on antibiotics on admission, were continued for a total 8 days course.
A left thoracentesis was attempted, but patient blood pressure dropped to the 70s.
Patient's blood pressures remained low despite support with levophed, phenylephrine, and vasopressin.
He was persistently acidemic despite maximal ventilatory setting.
He was given stress dose steroids, broadened to ESBL and anti-fungal coverage and still continued to remain pressor dependent.
After discussion with the family about his poor prognosis, patient was terminally extubated and pressor support was withdrawn and he expired shortly thereafter.
A nutrition consult was placed for input into the best method/route of providing nutrition in this patient.
Patient refused NGT and he was started on TPN on [**2147-12-9**] and patient tolerated it well.
GI was also consulted given his diarrhea, with recommendations for a hemochromatosis workup including DNA testing, MRI liver, AFP, vitamin K levels.
He was started on high dose IV pantoprazole.
H. Pylori was negative.
Endocrine was consulted and adjusted levothyroxine dose as needed based on thyroid function tests.
#) RASH: The patient exhibited a scaly, peeling rash over most of his extremities and trunk.
Zinc level low, vitamin C pending.
He receieved repletion with vitamin C, MVI and thiamine during his ICU course, as well as Aquaphor lotion for his xerosis.
#) THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Allergic to heparin products, not receiving them here, but central line was coated in heparin.
Thrombocytopenia likely a result of alcohol induced bone marrow suppression with contribution from malnutrition.
No evidence of active bleeding, although meets criteria for transfusion with hemoglobin of 7.0.
No evidence of active bleeding and folate and vitB12 are normal.
In addition, macrocytic anemia with thrombocytopenia can be a result of MDS/Myeloma/POEMS syndrome.
