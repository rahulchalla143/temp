Brief Hospital Course: 84 YO woman with hypertension, NIDDM, meningioma, and left ductal carcinoma in situ who presented to [**Hospital1 25991**]Hospital following a generalized tonic clonic seizure and was found to have a new intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
As the patient presented after epileptiform activity and was thought to suffer a second witnessed seizure in the ED, the epilepsy team was asked to participate in the patient's care.
Accordingly, it was recommended that anti-epileptic therapy be continued for six to nine months (rather than the one to two week prophylactic course typically prescribed) and then gradually tapered.
Since the patient's family believed the patient was sedated with keppra, the [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was discontinued in favor of dilantin (with a target trough of 10 to 12).
Shortly after it was ordered, she refused this regimen and, thereafter, refused IV access.
Her antibiotics were therefore switched to linezolid and ciprofloxacin as these were the only antibiotics that she would accept.
Neurology spoke with the patient on several occasions and discussed the need for anti-epileptic medication but she declined dilantin and keppra.
This was discussed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 16258**] with a plan to switch to trileptal as an outpatient after further discussion given increased risk of hyponatremia in the setting of likely lung lesions/malignancy seen on CT. .
The patient was therefore discharged with a plan for 24 hour home care, her home pre-hospitalization anti-hypertensive management regimen, a course of antibiotics partially treating hospital acquired pneumonia, and recommendation to continue dilantin until follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 16258**].
