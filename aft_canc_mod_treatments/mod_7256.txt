Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 79**] is an 84 year old gentleman with a PMH of CLL diagnosed [**2180**], now on Campath 3x/week (since [**2194-12-15**]), asthma, hypertension and bronchietasis, admitted with acute onset respiratory distress, productive cough, fever, and AMS, found to have LLL pneumonia, initially stabilized on nebulizers and IV antibiotics in the ICU, then with continued improvement on the floor with oral antibiotics.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Febrile respiratory distress: Most likely from infectious process in left lung base, as demonstrated on chest x-ray, superimposed on poor lung substrate from chronic bronchiectasis and asthma.
Possible organisms were broad, given that Campath affects all cell lines, including bacterial, viral, atypicals, and fungals.
Patient had been on bactrim prophylaxis prior to admission, so PCP was unlikely.
PE was in the realm of possibility given malignancy and acute onset of symptoms; however he was not tachycardic and hypoxia improved with nebulizers and supplemental oxygen.
In the ICU, the patient was started on empiric broad antibiotic coverage with meropenem and vancomycin to cover for HCAP; he continued his home Bactrim, acyclovir and fluconazole.
He received scheduled beta agonist and steroid nebulizer treatments, as well as supplemental IV fluid.
On the floor, he continued nebulizer treatments and transitioned to oral antibiotics.
He restarted Campath treatment on [**2195-1-2**] without incident.
Patient was discharged with instructions to complete a full two weeks of levofloxacin (through [**2195-1-15**]), and continue his home nebulizers and inhalers on a regular basis.
His BPH medications were less likely culprits of his hypotension.
He received a supplemental blood transfusion during this admission to replete his hematocrit.
Per his outpatient oncologist, the patient skipped his Campath dose on [**2194-12-31**], and resumed treatment on [**2195-1-2**].
He tolerated treatment well, and will continue as an outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] on [**2195-1-5**].
# Chronic kidney disease: During admission, creatine remained 1.3-1.4 within his baseline range (1.3-1.6).
# BPH: Patient continued his home tamsulosin and finasteride.
