Her WBC count was 14.1 and her initial lactate was 5 which trended down to 2.1 after fluid resuscitation.
She was empirically treated with Cipro and Flagyl.
A right IJ central line was placed for the initial resuscitation.
Given the concern for cardiogenic shock, a bedside ECHO was attempted by the ED which showed a dilated right ventricle.
She was guaiac negative and the concern for PE was high given these findings so she was empirically started on a heparin drip since her Cr=1.7 and the goal was to avoid a dye load for a CTA.
She was started on dopamine which was soon maxed out and Levophed was added as well.
Of note, she had several failed attempts at a right femoral and left radial A-lines on heparin with a lot of bleeding at the leg site.
