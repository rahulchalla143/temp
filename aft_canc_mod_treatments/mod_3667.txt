Brief Hospital Course: This is a 28 year old male with AML s/p 3rd allo SCT (2 sibling donors, 1 MUD) ~6 months ago who was admitted after a bone marrow biopsy was indicative for recurrent AML in order to receive chemotherapy.
# AML: He received 5 days of chemotherapy on a regimen that included cytarabine, mitoxantrone, and Mylotarg which he tolerated well except for some rigors with Mylotarg which responded to demerol and some fevers after cytarabine infusions.
Otherwise, he had mild nausea and headaches that responded to lorazepam and oxycodone.
He had fevers which were believed to be due to the cytarabine since the fevers only occurred following the chemo and cultures were negative.
He received tumor lysis and DIC labs frequently during chemo, none of which were positive.
His cell counts began to rise after 6 days, and he no longer required transfusions of red cells or platelets.
# Febrile neutropenia/ID: He was put on cefepime prophylaxis while neutropenic and vancomycin was added when he spiked through cefepime.
He was also maintained on acyclovir, ursodiol, and voriconazole prophylaxis.
The patient had VRE bacteremia and the patient was started on linezolid and vancomycin was d/c'ed.
The fevers persisted and due to rising LFT voriconazole was switched to micafungin and cefepime was changed to meropenem as fevers continued.
As LFT's normalized the pt continued to have fevers, tachycardia and developed sharp [**Month/Year (2) 5283**] abdominal pain and mica was changed to vori again, and an extensive work up including [**Month/Year (2) 5283**] US, CT A/P, MRI of liver, HIDA scan, surface ECHO, CTA of chest, CT non-con of chest was pursued to evaluate the cause of the pt's persistent hyperdynamic state and severe pleuritic pain.
Pulm was consulted on [**8-14**] and pt underwent a bronch on [**8-15**] that he seemed to tolerated well.
He was placed on a NRB with improvement in sats to 100% but a large A-a gradient with ABG 7.44/45/79, lactate of 1.0.
The patient was discharged from voriconazole and started on ambisome and posaconazole for increased aspergillus as well as atypical fungal coverage.
On [**8-26**], the patient was switched to daptomycin in preparation for his stem cell boost on [**8-28**], however, this caused a rise in the patients LFTs and bilirubin.
The patient remained clinically stable, and the ambisome and meropenem were also discontinued.
ID was consulted, who felt that given that he had already received one month's worth of treatment between the daptomycin and linezolid, it was reasonable to simply stop the drug and watch for fever.
#Rib pain - After returning to the floor from the ICU, the patient continued to complain of severe lateral thoracic pain, R>L that required treatment with q4h IV dilaudid.
He was switched to MS contin and was subsequently weaned over the course of several days off of the narcotics.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute myelogenous leukemia   Discharge Condition: stable, afebrile, ambulatory   Discharge Instructions: Your were admitted to [**Hospital1 **] Hospital for chemotherapy after a bone marrow biopsy showed recurrence of your AML.
You received chemotherapy for this and a stem cell boost on [**8-28**].
We found that you had an infection with a bacteria known as vancomycin resistant enterococcus, and you were treated with antibiotics for this.
We were also concerned that you had a fungal infection in your chest, for which you were also treated with several medications known as posaconazole and ambisome.
Because this occurred while you were on voriconazole, we changed your fungus prophylaxis to posaconazole.
There have been several changes to your medications.
The list included with these instructions is the most up-to-date and complete list of your medications.
Please take these medications as prescribed.
Please seek medical care for any concerning symptoms such as fevers >100.4, chills, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, or shortness of breath.
