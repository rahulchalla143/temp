Brief Hospital Course: 40 year-old male with hx of metastatic gastric cancer, s/p multiple abdominal surgeries, and s/p intra-abdominal chemo/XRT who presented to the ED after his G-tube fell out and was admitted with sepsis, likely from intra-abdominal source.
CT abd/pelvis revealed an intra-abdominal rim-enhancing fluid collection.
He was covered with broad spectrum antibiotics (vanc, cefepime, flagyl) in addition to anti-fungal therapy with micafungin since he had been receiving TPN.
He required pressure support with leveophed, which was eventually weaned.
CT body and IR were consulted for potential drain(s) replacement, and a new G-tube.
He would have required multiple procedures and general anesthesia.
The patient was closely followed by the Infectious Disease consult team, and antibiotic/antifungal coverage was gradually narrowed.
The most likely source for his fever was felt to be persistent intra-abdominal infection, with limited antibiotic penetrance into abdominal fluid collection.
The patient again declined any surgical or IR-guided drainage of the fluid collection, as his goal was to be discharged home with hospice care.
He was discharged home on ceftriaxone, and per ID he will need to be on this antibiotic indefinitely.
At time of discharge, the patient was again to receive hospice care at home.
He will no longer receive TPN at home, but is able to tolerate a clear liquid diet.
He will continue to take prochlorperazine as needed for nausea.
