He was found to have a digoxin level of 3.8, and his digoxin was held.
He had been evaluated by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in [**Month (only) 958**] of [**2133**] and intervention was deferred in light of his multiple co-morbidities.
Past Medical History: # CAD: LAD 50-60% prox at first septal perf, 1st septal branch 60%; RCA 80% prox; RI 80% prox per cath in [**2125**].
# Cardiomyopathy with EF 15-20%, ?ischemic vs non-ischemic # h/o moderate MR and severe TR--Echo [**2134-5-25**] showed trivial MR and TR # AFlutter and Paroxysmal AFib, remote h/o LV thrombus, on amiodarone but not coumadin (developed macular degeneration attributed to coumadin) # BiV PPM with ICD placed [**2130**], ?
ICD deactivated shortly thereafter:  BiV PPM [**Company 1543**] Insync III 8042; ICD component removed later in [**2130**] to reflect code status # HTN # Hyperlipidemia # Prostate Cancer metastatic to vertebrae, diagnosed [**2130**].
Followed by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] # h/o BOOP currently on steroid taper # COPD--per records BUT PFTs from [**4-/2134**] showed mild decrease FEV1 and FVC with normal ratio (RESTRICTIVE pattern) # Psoriasis # Iron deficiency anemia with hx GI bleed--baseline Hct 28-32 # CRI (baseline creatinine 2.0) # Macular degeneration # s/p left hip replacement # Hypothyroidism # Metastatic prostate cancer dx in [**4-22**] # RUL lung opacity - unclear etiology, s/p unremarkable bronchoscopy [**2-23**] with cytology negative for malignancy  ALLERGIES: ?
yet, BP 109/60, HR 111, RR 19, O2 100% on 3L on dopamine at 5.
Strength 5/5 in LLE; unable to test strength in RLE [**12-19**] to recent procedure.
IMPRESSION: On the right, there is significant calcified plaque with an 80-99% carotid stenosis.
Cath/Carotid Stent [**2134-5-26**]: 1.
Successful PTA/stent to right ICA with a 6-8x40mm Protege stent and 8.0x20mm stent more proximal.
Patient with hemodynamic instablity at end of procedure but was stable on transfer to CCU.
Severe stenosis of right ICA with heavy calcification 2.
Resting hemodynamics on dopamine 12 mcg/kg/min demonstrated initial right and left heart filling pressures (RVEDP 5 mm Hg, PCW mean 7 mm Hg), with markedly decreased pulmonary arterial oxygen saturation of 33% and a depressed cardiac index of 1.64 l/min/m2.
CXR [**2134-5-29**]: There has been interval placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter with distal lead tip in the distal right pulmonary artery.
Brief Hospital Course: 83yo gentleman with h/o CAD, chronic systolic heart failure with EF 15%, AFib not on coumadin, s/p PPM admitted with recurrent episodes of transient neurological deficits.
He had a carotid stent placed and was transferred to the CCU for monitoring.
The patient's blood pressure was labile during his procedure and he required dopamine to maintain his pressures upon transfer out of the cath lab.
Swan ganz demonstrated that the patient was dehydrated and he was given fluids for volume resuscitation.
He was also put on broad spectrum antibiotics in case he was developing sepsis with hypotension.
Dopamine was weaned, but the patient developed acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency.
Renal was consulted and felt that the patient would likely require hemodialysis if his renal function did not improve soon.
# Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation s/p PPM: Digoxin was held given recently elevated levels, but digoxin levels trended up in the setting of his heart failure.
He was not on coumadin b/c of macular degeneration (per patient).
Although pt had wide complex tachycardia on presentation, his baseline EKGs prior to PPM placement demonstrated LBBB.
# Chronic BOOP: Prednisone was stopped after discussing the matter with his pulmonologist.
prednisone taper  # [**Female First Name (un) 564**] esophagitis: Diagnosed in [**2134-4-18**], ?
