Patient was given IV vit K, FFP x 1 and 1U pRBCs in the ED.
Hct remained stable on the floor and anticoagulation continued to be held, until the patient left against medical advice.
He had previously been on dabigatran but switched to warfarin w/o informing his providers [**12-27**] cost issues.
Patient was given FFP and vitamin K with improvement of his INR.
His CHADS2 score is 2 suggesting that he would benefit from continued anticoagulation when his bleed stabilizes- per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2903**] he will try to obtain prior authorization for dabigatran given his adverse event with warfarin.
He did show signs of mild end organ damage w/ [**Last Name (un) **] which resolved with 4 units pRBCs and 2L IVF (see below for discussion of troponins) but did not require any pressor support.
This persistent relative hypotension in the setting of a stable hct was attributed to intravascular volume depletion as the patient developed significant LE edema as well as poor forward output in the setting of his frequent AF w/ rapid rates as high as 140s.
The patient left against medical adivce before these problems could be optimally managed (see below).
Likley [**12-27**] to his severe anemia.
His dyspnea resolved with HCT improvement.
This was attributed to his blood loss and trended back to baseline with transfusions and IVF.
#) acute on chronic systolic CHF: Patient w/ EF of 40-45% in [**2141**] with moderate to severe MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], lasix was held in setting of bleed as was his toprol XL.
He was put on metoprolol tartrate with attempts to uptitrate as below.
Patient left AMA (see below) before diuretics could be restarted.
Rate control was attempted with metoprolol though it was difficult to uptitrate in the setting of his relative hypotension.
His anticoagulation was held as above.
#) HLD: Patient's simvastatin was initially held in MICU, but then restarted prior to discharge at half dose (40 mg daily) given black box warning against simvastatin 80 mg.  #) Disposition: Patient insisted on leaving on [**3-3**] as he had had "slept 2 hours" the entire time he had been in the hospital and was not comfortable here.
