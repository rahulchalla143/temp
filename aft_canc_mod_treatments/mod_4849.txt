Images of the upper abdomen demonstrate a normal-appearing liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas.
However, aspiration cannot be excluded and clinical correlation is recommended.
He was being treated for pneumonia/COPD exacerbation and was found to have AML on BM biopsy.
He was intubated for worsening respiratory status and developed ARF.
Initially was thought to be having COPD flare and was empirically covered with antibiotics and steroids.
However, he continued to require increased support from non-rebreather to biPAP to ventilator with worsening O2 saturations.
Cultres were obtained including sputum, BAL, blood, and urine but did not grow any microorganisms.
ID was involved and various serologic markers were negative.
His antibiotics were broadened and included antifungals and antivirals for a short time but he continued to worsen.
Despite these interventions, his respiratory status progressively worsened during the hospital course, despite aggressive antibiotics, chemo, and ventilatory support.
He was started on idarubicin and cytarabine.
Tumor lysis labs were followed and he was treated with rasburicase on [**2152-7-2**].
He was then continued on allopurinol.
As above CVVH was continued for toxin removal in addition to controling his acidosis and volume overload.
He was eventually started on CVVH in order to start chemotherapy.
# Hypotension: Over the course of hospitalization, patient required pressure support.
He was started on low dose levophed and stress dose steroids as he has been on prolonged steroids during hospital stay.
# Thrombocytopenia: HIT antibodies were negative.
# Hyperglycemia: The patient was kept on insulin sliding scale.
His insulin was titrated.
He was given tube feeds for nutrition.
