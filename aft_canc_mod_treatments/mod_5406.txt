Intubation x 1.
He was given ativan 2mg IV x 1, after which he was reportedly "confused", following commands incorrectly.
He was given lactulose at 0040 and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
ROS per his wife is negative for fevers, chills, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, other complaints.
He was admitted for TIPS procedure and had ammonia level in the 200s at the time.
He was treated with dilantin (goal 20-25) and then a versed gtt.

He has rhythmic jerking of his eyebrows, but not his arms or legs.
MS: Nonverbal, not following commands, responds to noxious CN: pupils equal and reactive, unable to assess EOM as head tonically deviated to right, but eyes are to the right with right beating nystagmus.
Routine sampling and spike and seizure detection programs demonstrated several episodes of rhythmic 8 Hz monomorphic blunted sharp wave discharges occurring in a generalized distribution.
Limited evaluation secondary to lack of intravenous contrast administration.
Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in good position.
No evidence of acute abdominal or pelvic pathology within the limitations described.\  CT torso - [**2198-10-23**] " CHEST: The patient is status post tracheostomy tube placement, with the tip terminating at the level of thoracic inlet.
Foley catheter is noted in the urinary bladder.
The nasopharynx is opaciifed with a tube, likely nasogastric tube within.
Presumably, these findings relate to the intubated status of the patient.
This may represent sinusitis or post intubation changes  [**2198-10-26**] Most recent labs - see attached printout.
He was also not using his R(dominant) hand as much as usual.
The patient again had difficulty breathing and was intubated and started on propofol gtt.
At this point his anti-seizure regimen inlcuded Keppra, Neurontin, Dilantin, and propofol.

He was empirically started on vancomycin and Zosyn for concern of sepsis.
Blood cultures from [**2198-8-7**] grew coag negative staph and vancomycin sensitive enterococcus.
An EEG on [**2198-8-8**] was read by the covering resident as suggestive of insufficient burst suppression and the patient was given a 400mg IV dilantin bolus.
He was started on amiodarone.
By [**2198-8-10**] pressors were weened off and Zosyn was stopped.
Vancomycin was continued for a two week course.
On [**2198-8-11**] the patient was started on a versed gtt and dilantin was started.
Plans for a PEG tube were thwarted by the patient's overwhelming edema, which was a result of the fluid boluses he recived while hypotensive/septic.
Lasix and aldactone were used to diurese approximately 15 liters off the patient.
Since then, he has been gradually weaned off phenobarb with no significant changes in his EEG.
Ativan was also slightly tapered and zonegran was slightly increased.
He also had intermittent episodes of hypotension, therefore his metoprolol was decreased from QID to [**Hospital1 **] and this resolved.
Lisinopril was added for renal protection given his DM.
Hospital Summary from [**9-20**] - [**10-6**] Neuro: pt had his phenobarbital weaned down with improvement in his alertness - opening eyes much more.
As a result, his medical regimen was increased with stabilization of his EEG.
After several days, his phenobarbital again was weaned to 100 mg PO BID.
His Ativan was also weaned and his Zonegran dose was increased.
He was also started on Topamax with less frequent discharges on above AED therapy.
Note that 1 week prior to discharge hid improved neurologically on a daily basis: he made eye-contact, would fix and follow a face (non consistently), and would occasionally following midline commands such as sticking out his tongue, and mouthing words like "good-morning".
He should have interval EEGs to assess for continued epileptiform activity.
As this patient is complex, in case of questions please do not hesitate to contact the epilepsy fellow regarding his EEG findings, for proper electro-clinical correlation.
Metoprolol dose was halved with improvement in his BPs with stable bps on metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] and lisinopril.
Staph aureus was cultured, and for concern of PNA he was started on Vancomycin, but continued on regimen with continued staph in his sputum.
He was also on Rifaximin for selective decontamination.
Hepatology followed the patient during hospital stay, with advise regarding management of his liver failure, adjusting lactulose and others, metabolic management.
FEN: Stable electrolytes with only occasional replacement necessary.
He had a Dobhoff in place fo several weeks, and an assessment of the amount of ascitis by U/S on [**10-22**] showed no intra-abdominal ascites, making PEG placement possible.
This should be considered on a day-care basis, unless the patient's level of consciousness allows him a safe swallow, and the enteral feedings prove to be only temporary.
Endo: The continued to have low thyroid function, likely absorption impaired [**1-19**] continuous feeds, so he was changed to IV thyroxine with improvement after gradual upward titration of the dosis.
Heme: All lineages decreasing on [**10-5**], hematology was consulted, iron and vitamin studies were normal.
In summary, the pancytopenia was considered secondary to chronic illness with polypharmacy, and a bone marrow biopsy was not performed.
Fortunately, he did improve during the last week of his stay he did suddenly improve, with eye-contact and occasionally following midline commands, and mouthing words like "good-morning".
