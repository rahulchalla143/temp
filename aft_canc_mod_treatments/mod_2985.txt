The patient received 2 liters of normal saline and was intubated for airway protection.
The patient required no sedation while on the ventilator.
At [**Hospital 86**] Hospital, the patient was admitted directly to the Intensive Care Unit where he initially required pressor support with dopamine.
The patient was hydrated and given stress-dose steroids with hydrocortisone given pituitary macroadenoma seen on head CT.  Of note, the patient did not require any sedation while intubated.
The patient was transfused with packed red blood cells.
The patient subsequently sent out coffee-grounds emesis from a nasogastric tube with maroon-colored stools.
The patient was started on intravenous Protonix and a Helicobacter pylori antibody was sent which returned negative.
Given the large pituitary macroadenoma seen on head CT and hypothermia and hypotension on presentation, a workup for panhypopituitarism was initiated.
Initial cortisol level drawn prior to the administration of hydrocortisone was 11 (normal range 3 to 17).
Given low-normal free T4 and total T3 and relative hypotension the patient was started on intravenous levothyroxine and hydrocortisone.
The patient was started on ceftazidime and Flagyl for a presumed aspiration pneumonia.
Ceruloplasmin level was normal.
Alpha-fetoprotein was negative.
ENDOCRINE:  Prolactin was 9.6 (normal 2 to 20).
Cortisone stimulation test (no prednisone given 24 hours prior to test) was 22, 27, and 23.
Thyroid-stimulating hormone was less than 0.05.
Alpha-fetoprotein was 2.6.
Ferritin was 22.
(b)  Blood cultures 1/4 bottles from [**2128-10-30**] drawn from subclavian central line were positive for Staphylococcus aureus coagulase-positive oxacillin resistant.
The patient underwent a right-sided therapeutic thoracentesis on [**11-4**] with removal of 1400 cc of clear serous fluid.
Therefore, treatment for hepatopulmonary syndrome remained supportive with supplemental oxygen.
The patient was initially started on stress-dose hydrocortisone which was tapered to 30 mg intravenously q.a.m.
In addition, he was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg p.o.
Given the relative hypoxia and poor medical condition, the patient was unstable to go to the operating room for surgical resection of the pituitary mass.
Given the use of subcutaneous heparin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis at the outside hospital a hemagglutination-inhibition test antibody was sent and was positive.
The patient was supported with cryo to maintain fibrinogen greater than 100, and fresh frozen plasma was given prior to procedures.
The patient's central line was removed, and the patient was started on vancomycin.
However, heparin products were avoided.
Ceruloplasmin and iron levels were both normal.
At the outside hospital the patient had an upper gastrointestinal bleed with coffee-grounds emesis and maroon stools.
The patient was kept on Protonix 40 mg intravenously b.i.d.
The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells.
Per discussions with family, management was to be supportive care only.
