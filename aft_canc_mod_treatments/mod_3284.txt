Course and treatment outlined as follows:  MICU Course: The patient was admitted from the ED with central line in place on levophed.
Overnight his hyperglycemia and hypovolemia were managed with 1/2NS and insulin drip transitioned to NPH [**Hospital1 **] when resuming PO intake.
The patient was found to have a UTI and started on Vanc/Zosyn with levo for ?
C. diff: the patient's stool cultures were positive for C. diff so he was started on Flagyl.
He will complete a two week course as an outpatient.
Antibiotics were empirically started given initial UA and CXR however cultures did not grow out legionella.
His history of a-fib appear to be well controlled on his two beta blockers so this is less likely a reason.
Additionally, his hyperglycemia was brought under control so that he did not continue to have osmotic diurresis.
?s hyperglycemia was likely due to pancreatic insufficiency in the setting of pancreatic cancer and s/p whipple.
He was initially treated with Insulin Gtt and was successfully transitioned to NPH/SS.
[**Last Name (un) **] diabetes consult provided directed care in order for him to achieve a good insulin regimen and the patient received training on how to manage his blood sugars at home.
Mucocytis: Patient has chemotherapy induced mucocytis without neutropenia.
provided significant relief for the patient and he tolerated cardiac/diabetic healthy diet.
HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY): resolved with glucose correction  ANEMIA, ACUTE on CHRONIC: Anemia secondary to probable anemia of chronic disease and underlying infection and possible bone marrow suppression from chemotherapy.
Additionally, given the a-fib event that he had on the floor, his aspirin was increased to 325 mg daily from his baby aspirin.
He had otherwise stable vital signs and his afib tachycardia to the 160s was brought down with beta blocker therapy and by placing him on his home beta blocker regimen over the course of his stay.
