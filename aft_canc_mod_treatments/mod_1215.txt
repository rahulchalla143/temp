Admission Date:  [**2171-10-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-10-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2109-4-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Codeine  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**] Chief Complaint: right shoulder - pain- RUL lung tumor for excision s/p chemotherapy and radiation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right posterior and lateral thoracotomy, right upper     lobectomy with en bloc chest wall resection of ribs 2 and     3.
Right cervical incision with scalene fat pad and lymph     node resection as well as mobilization of superior sulcus     tumor off of 1st rib and division of the 2nd rib     anteriorly.
She underwent cervical mediastinoscopy as well as peripheral metastatic workup.
She underwent induction of chemoradiotherapy to shrink the tumor away from the subclavian artery and subclavian vein as well as the brachial plexus.
We, therefore, took her forward for a resection of the superior sulcus tumor.
Our plan was to biopsy the scalene fat pad and lymph nodes and if there is no evidence of tumor to move on to mobilize the superior sulcus tumor from the cervical incision, including division of ribs as necessary.
We would then move on to a posterolateral thoracotomy for completion of the procedure.
Past Medical History: Gastric esophogeal reflux disease, Coronary artery disease, diabetes type 2, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Non small cell lung cancer s/p chemotherapy and radiation.
