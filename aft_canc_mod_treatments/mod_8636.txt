His house was apparently condemned by the [**Location (un) **] Police due to multiple dead animals on the property including rats and racoons EMS was called and administered 5 mg of Valium and 10mg of Morphine in the field.
He was intubated given abnormal respirations.
The patient was given a total of 11 liters IVF in the ED and his pressure rose to 103/60 on arrival to the MICU.
He was placed on broad spectrum abx and given 10 mg IV valium, 10 mg IV Ativan and 1 gram of dilantin load in the ED for continued L eye deviation with rhythmic jerking of the L arm and leg.
The patient continued to have seizures in the MICU, he was given an extra 600 mg of Phenytoin and subsequently started on a Propofol gtt.
Neuro:MS-intubated Cranial Nerves: Pupils 2 mm, reactive, + corneal reflex, + VOR, mouth obscured by ETT support so difficult to assess symmetry Motor/[**Last Name (un) **]: No spontaneous movements except seizure activity with L sided limb shaking.
This finding could relate to prior intubation or potentially be inflammatory in origin, as fluid levels were seen on the prior study within both sphenoid air cells on [**2197-7-22**].
There is also prominent high T2 signal within the mastoid sinuses, which again could relate to prior intubation or be inflammatory in origin.
The tumor should be considered a grade 2 out of 4 infiltrating glioma with low proliferative potential   Brief Hospital Course: On arrival to the [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to be septic with a temperature of 104, blood pressure of 76/59, and was given a total of 11L IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
He was also loaded with Dilantin, given IV Ativan and Valium for continued seizures.
He was transferred to the MICU where he was loaded with phenobarbital and given propofol for continued evidence of seizures.
Pt had initially required pressors for BP support in the ICU and remained intubated for respiratory failure and pulmonary edema.
The pressors were weaned over the first few days in the ICU.
Weight based heparin was started for treatment of PE and therefore, surgery was delayed.
Pt then had recurrence of fever while intubated and was treated with a full course of antibiotics for presumed ventilator associated pneumonia.
The patient had an IVC filter placed as he could not be on IV heparin for the biopsy.
After diuresis and resolution of pulmonary edema/pneumonia, the patient was extubated on [**8-9**].
The patient has been maintained on Dilantin and phenobarbital for seizure suppresion.
Pt passed his swallow study on [**8-14**], NG tube was removed and he has been eating well since with no need for supplemental nutrition.
Pt was restarted on Lovenox sc BID for ongoing treatment of PE and was restarted on most of his pre-admission medications.
His Metformin was not restarted due to normal fasting blood sugars and minimal need for sliding scale insulin.
Niacin was restarted at 500mg PO qhs and this should be increased by 500mg each sunday until he reachs a goal dose of 2000mg qhs as tolerated, per his PCP.
