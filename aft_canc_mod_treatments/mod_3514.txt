LAD was stented w/ heparin coated stents X 2 and Reopro such that Plavix could be DC'd if needed in the setting of acute GI bleed.
Following intervention, patient dropped SBP to 70s, and was started on dopamine drip, w/ HR in 120s-130s, and bolused w/ 1400cc NS.
Heparin was stopped, and no additional IIB/IIIA inhibitor given due to history of BRBPR X few days and decreased hematocrit.

Successful PTCA/stenting of the proximal/mid LAD with 2.5x18mm and 2.5x18mm overlapping Hepacoat stents.
Although this was physiology consistent with sepsis or adrenal insufficiency, patient was never febrile, CXR and pan-cultures were negative, and cosyntropin stimulation yielded appropriate secretion of cortisol.
Spontaneously weaned off of dopamine on hospital day 3 without complications.
Indeed, patient became hypertensive to SBP160s, and was started easily on carvedilol and lisinopril at that point.
Given this clinical picture, patient's initial hypotension post STEMI was thought to be secondary to cardiogenic shock despite Swan-Ganz values, and as patient's cardiac function recovered, blood pressure improved appropriately.
RTA Type II was felt to be a possibility, and bicarb load was considered- however, this was not attempted given patient's cardiac issues and need for euvolemic status.
Patient was started on ASA, Plavix, Lipitor 80, and carvedilol and lisinopril as hypotension resolved.
Although further intervention could be pursued, given high grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor and multiple nodules noted on MRI and CT at [**Hospital1 2025**] and [**Hospital3 1443**], it was felt that patient would be best served with workup and thorough staging and prognostic evaluation of malignancy to further determine utility of revascularization.
Hypotensive but weaning dopamine, continue IV fluids for now.
As noted above, as hypotension improved, patient was started on carvedilol and lisinopril to improve cardiac remodeling.
* Rhythm: While on dopamine, patient was in continuous sinus tachycardia (110s-140s).
With weaning of dopamine and uptitration of carvedilol, patient's heart rate improved to 60s-80s at the time of discharge.
Further consideration for prophylactic ICD placement would pend revascularization of remaining 2 vessel disease.
* PVD: Severe iliac disease seen on cath, as correlates with patient's baseline claudication (can walk 10ft).
* BRBPR: Following catheterization, patient was noted to have BRBPR and required one unit of packed red cells.
However, following this acute episode, patient had guaiac negative stools and no longer required any further transfusions.
It was recommended to the patient that she undergo outpatient colonscopy for further evaluation.
