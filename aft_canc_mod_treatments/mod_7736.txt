In addition, his warfarin, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor were held.
He underwent both EGD and colonoscopy on [**2152-10-4**] which found non-bleeding mucosal change consistent with Barrett's and an ascending colonic AVM x2 which was clipped with 3 endoclips with resolution of bleeding.
His Hct remained stable while in the MICU post endoscopic intervention.
His ACE-I, Spironolactone, HCTZ were restarted and patient was switched from home Atenolol, which was being held, to Metoprolol 25mg because of renal insufficiency.
ASA, lisinopril, atenolol were held initially, though restarted per above.
Simvastatin was continued.
On floor he did not require transfusions as his Hct remained stable around 30.
Patient remained rate controlled off atenolol in setting of GIB.
Warfarin and ASA were stopped and INR was reversed with vitamin K and FFP.
When transferred to the floor his aspirin was restarted and atenolol changed to Metoprolol because of renal insufficiency.
He was not restarted Coumadin nor is he being discharged on Coumadin.
Should readdress Coumadin as an outpatient and the risks of stroke given CHADS2 score=4 should be weighed against the risk of rebleeding  # Acute Renal Failure.
ACE inhibitor was held while in the MICU.

Atenolol was switched to Metoprolol given renal insufficiency.
