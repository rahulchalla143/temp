There was some spill-over with all consistencies as well, including delayed aspiration of residue, to a trace to mild extent, of both thin liquids and pudding.
Because of aspiration, the study was discontinued, suctioning performed via the tracheostomy tube by the Radiology nursing staff.

Date: [**2173-8-23**] Signed by [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 57715**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15102**], CCC-SLP on [**2173-8-23**] Affiliation: [**Hospital1 18**]  DEFERRED PASSY MUIR VALVE CONSULT  Thank you for referring this 69 y/o Cambodian speaking female with recent h/o thyroid goiter, thyroidectomy, trach and PEG placement.
Pt was transferred here on [**2173-8-20**] for further management.
PMH includes thyroid CA, tracheal stenosis with trach, UTI, PNA, DM, HTN, possible hypoxic brain injury, CVA, asthma, B-cell lymphoma s/p chemo, hiatal hernia.
Pt was unable to tolerate placement of the Passy Muir Valve due to severe upper airway obstruction which prohibited her from being able to exhale adequately via the upper airway (nose and mouth) around the tracheostomy tube.
With regards to swallowing, the pt had FEES exam completed on [**2173-5-31**] that revealed "moderate pharyngeal dysphagia at with overt aspiration of secretions, thin and nectar thick liquids.
There was  stenosis around the entry site of the tube and the bronchoscope could not be passed "alongside the tracheostomy tube even with the cuff down on the tracheostomy tube".
The bronchoscope was passed "down the tracheostomy tube" where "absolutely no stenosis or foreign body occluding either the lumen of the tube or the airway of the distal trachea down to the segmental airway level bilaterally" was appreciated.
I discussed with him that perhaps with a smaller trach tube the pt may be able to tolerate the valve, but that I did not know if that would be feasible and if the pt would have any difficulty with inhalation with a smaller trach tube.
As such, I discussed that we would follow up with the pt tomorrow to determine if she is a candidate for a Passy Muir Valve at that time.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Respiratory failure, status post tracheostomy, tracheal stenosis.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Respiratory failure, status post tracheostomy, supraglottic edema, subglottic edema and tracheal stenosis.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname **] was intubated with a black [**12-19**] rigid tracheoscope.
The patient should remain with her current tracheostomy tube and should return to the special procedures unit within 4 to 6 weeks for a flexible bronchoscope and reassessment of her airway anatomy.
ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) **], MD  Signed by [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 57715**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15102**], CCC-SLP on [**2173-8-24**] Affiliation: [**Hospital1 18**]  BLUE DYE BEDSIDE SWALLOWING EVALUATION: HISTORY: We returned today to follow up on this 69 y/o Cambodian speaking female with recent h/o thyroid goiter, thyroidectomy, trach and PEG placement.
Pt was transferred here on [**2173-8-20**] for further management.
She has been evaluated in the past, but the recommendations were for NPO with enteral nutrition/hydration via the PEG tube.
RN reports that the pt's tracheal secretions have not been excessive and she has not required frequent suctioning.
ORAL MOTOR EXAM: WFL for labial and lingual strength, ROM, and symmetry.
BLUE DYE SWALLOWING ASSESSMENT: PO swallowing assessment was completed at bedside with thin liquids and purees colored with food coloring.
However, given her prior h/o aspiration and dysphagia and current tube feeding dependency, would recommend that the pt receive a video swallow study prior to any advancement to a po diet at this time.
Remain NPO with enteral nutrition at this time.
[**2173-8-25**] OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEOFLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION EVALUATION: An oral and pharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed today in collaboration with Radiology.
of thin liquid, 2 tsp's and one sip of nectar-thick liquid, and 2 tsp's of pureed consistency barium were administered.
Results follow: ORAL PHASE: Bolus formation, bolus control and anterior to posterior tongue movement were mildly impaired.
Once started, palatal elevation, pharyngeal bolus propulsion and upper esophageal sphincter relaxation were normal.
O2 saturation after suctioning was 98%.
Remain strictly NPO w/PEG feedings  2.
Started on levoquin x4 days for URI.
HD#1- Aggressive pulmonary toilet of nebs and tracheal suctioning done w/ clearer breath sounds.
Central venous line placed for access.
HD#[**2082-3-15**]- Flexible bronchoscopy-- edema soft tissues superior to cords; + tracheobrochial malcia, subglottic stenosis.Unable to do trach change due to edema.
HD#[**2083-4-13**] Now at baseline resp status w/ pulmonary toilet, nebs, suctioning.
Pt had just started Levothyroxine 137 mcg [**2173-8-12**], not started in hospital [**8-20**] but was on short acting T3 rx ofliothyronine 12.5 [**Hospital1 **].
Lioth d/c and levothyroxine 137 resumed.
PT consult, tube feedings resumeed and advanced to goal w/o complicaiton.
HD#[**7-14**]- PT/OT consults and Therapy done.
Bedside swallow eval, eval for passey/muir valve,  and video swallow done.
Swallow eval= aspiration, maintain NPO and cont PEG tubefeedings to prevent aspiration.
