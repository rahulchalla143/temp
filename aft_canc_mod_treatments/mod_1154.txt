More extensive ground-glass opacification in the upper aspect of the right lower lobe which is still consolidated at the base could be edema associated with pleural [**Month (only) **] interfering with lymphatic milking due to pleural restriction that prevents ventilatory change in lobar volume, however, could also be progression of pneumonia even though cavitation present previously has not worsened.

Active diagnoses: #Bilateral pleural effusions, R-sided empyema: CT on admission showed large bilateral pleural effusions, with the right one being loculated, which had reaccumulated from prior drainage 6/[**2114**].
Pt had R pigtail placed [**2115-7-5**] by IP with pleural [**Month/Day/Year **] exudative, cytology neg, culture with rare growth of lactobacillus and STREPTOCOCCUS ANGINOSUS.
Pt transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension (SBP to 80s) and tachycardia [**2115-7-5**].
Pt started on Vanc and ceftriaxone initially.
Because of the potential for sepsis, Ceftriaxone was broadened to Cefepime.
Flagyl was added.

Chest tube placed on R [**2115-7-8**] with pleural [**Month/Day/Year **] culture without growth.
Initial etiology of pt's pleural effusions still unclear since cytology consistently negative but known to reaccumulate.
The patient was seen by Thoracic Surgery as well as Interventional Pulmonology.
The tubes continued to [**Month/Day/Year 19843**] serosanguinous [**Month/Day/Year **] with intermittent instillations of alteplase and dronase.
Thoracic surgery felt intervention would not be beneficial given his overall clinical picture.
ID was consulted and pt was switched to meropenem monotherapy [**2115-7-11**] with plan for 4wk IV ABX course (starting [**2115-7-8**]).
Pt to be discharged on IV ertapenem q24h with plan to follow-up with ID and complete at minimum of 4wk course ([**2115-8-5**]).
[**2115-7-15**] smaller R pigtail removed by IP.
IP reported no need for placing another chest tube on the R. They want to follow-up with repeat chest CT and then appt in clinic to evaluate if reaccumulation occurs to require a chest tube.
Pt with small PTX after L tube exchanged.
L tube capped with plan for intermittent drainage M, W, F up to 1L each time.
Again, thoracic surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding possibility of intervention based on CT chest [**7-17**].
His hypotension responded well to boluses of NS.
His antihypertensive medications were held.
BP meds continue to be held on discharge.
#Thrush: pt put on fluconazole on admission because of inability to tolerate nystatin secondary to severe worsening of GERD.
