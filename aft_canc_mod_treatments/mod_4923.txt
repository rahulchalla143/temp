There was no evidence of acute bleeding, so FFP, platelets, and cryo were not given.
She was started on empiric vancomycin and meropenem for PNA coverage, with the intention of d/c'ing vanc if no GPC on blood or sputum cultures in 48h.
She was also placed on steroid taper since pt received decadron treatment at OSH.
She was kept on respiratory precautions due to h/o TB exposure, and sputum cultures were ordered to r/o active pulmonary TB, given history.
It was thought that the patient's DIC and lupus anticoagulant, in addition to possibly being hypercoagulable [**12-27**] likely lung malignancy, placed Ms. [**Known lastname 65506**] at very high risk for arterial thrombosis, and vascular surgery recommended heparinization if possible.
In the context of recent stroke, it was decided to avoid heparin until imaging of the brain could be done, and the neurology service consulted.
She was given diltiazem and metoprolol, which slowed her HR somewhat.
She also appeared agitated, and was started on fentanyl and versed, after which she appeared more comfortable, and more hemodynamically stable.
Neurology was consulted, who recommended obtaining an MRI/MRA/MRV, given hypercoagulable status, maintaining SBP>140, and holding heparin in the context of possible ongoing stroke.
An echocardiogram and carotid ultrasounds were also ordered, given thromboembolic possibilities, and she was kept on ASA 325mg qD.
Once Ms. [**Known lastname 65506**]' evolving and deteriorating clinical course was discussed with her HCP, it was decided to change the goals of care to comfort measures only.
Her other medications were d/c'ed, blood draws and radiology tests were d/c'ed, and Ms. [**Known lastname 65506**] was placed on a morphine drip.
At midnight, her endotracheal tube was pulled.
