[**2152-2-15**]:  INDICATION: Cholangiocarcinoma with previous metal stent placement and now rising liver function tests.
Initial scout image demonstrates a metal stent within the biliary tree.
ERCP: Ten fluoroscopic spot images were obtained by a gastroenterologist during an ERCP procedure without a radiologist present.
Scout image shows a metal stent which was subsequently removed.
A metal stent was placed, spanning the strictured portion.
IMPRESSION: Single irregular stricture of malignant appearance in the lower and middle third of the common bile duct with subsequent biliary stent placement across the strictured portion.
CT torso was performed with premedication to evaluate for metastatic and/or locally progressive disease.
ERCP evaluated her and recommended ERCP to evaluate the patency of stent and other ducts.
She underwent ERCP, during which her previous biliary stent was removed and replaced.
She was started on cefepime and flagyl.
During the repeat ERCP, her biliary stent was seen to be adjacent to the duodenum and eroding into the duodenal wall.
Out of concern for duodenal perforation, no intervention was performed during this ERCP.
She was started on vancomycin in addition to the cefepime/flagyl.
On [**2152-2-15**], because her alk phos and bilirubin were still rising, the patient underwent a 3rd ERCP, during which a defect was created in the distal portion of her previous stent so that bile could drain into the duodenum.
The patient was started on IV fluids as well as blood.
Unfortunately she bled again overnight, and the family and patient were offered a repeat RBC scan.
The patient was set-up with hospice care and prepared to go home comfortably with her family.
