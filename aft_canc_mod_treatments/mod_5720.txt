He also was noted to have a fib with RVR and hypotension to 80s systolic; was given adenosine without improvement.
After IVF BP improved to 90s systolic.
He was started on dilt gtt and became hypotensive to 70s; dilt was stopped and pressures improved to 100s-110s.
He was then given IV dig and his pressures and rates improved and pt felt much better.
He was started on IV heparin (not thrombolytics because of his recent GIB), nexium IV gtt for PPX and admitted to the [**Location (un) 5353**] MICU.
This morning in the [**Hospital1 392**] MICU he was given Digoxin 0.25mg IV ONCE, solumedrol 40mg IV ONCE, Combivent and flovent PRN and morphine PRN pain.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

Thrombolysis was not pursued given patient's metastatic carcinoma and recent internal bleeding.
Patient was continued on heparin drip titrated to goal PTT of 60-80.
Held off on embolectomy as patient had improving oxygenation saturations.
Given extent of clot burden, retrievable IVC filter was placed by IR.
Patient underwent echocardiogram which showed severely dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle, as well as mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
He was transitioned to lovenox from heparin gtt on [**2136-1-24**] and brought out to the floor for further management.
He was intermittently satting in mid 90s on RA, though intermittently continued to require 1L supplemental O2 via nasal cannula.
He was discharged on lovenox 80mg SC Q12H, and will follow-up with his oncologist regarding ongoing anticoagulation.
He should also discuss removal of his IVC filter with his oncologist and PCP.
#) Metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma: Patient with severe metastatic disease; was scheduled to start chemotherapy but has not yet received treatment.
#) Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Patient had episode of AF with RVR and was started on metoprolol and digoxin.
Patient alternated between sinus and AF, but on new regimen had no further episodes of RVR.
Patient was discharged on regimen of digoxin and metoprolol for rate control.
As above, is on anticoagulation with lovenox.
His home statin was held (per patient he had not been taking it for several weeks) and LFTs were closely monitored.
Elevations may also be secondary to liver metastases.
Seen by nutrition consult team who recommend consideration of TF and/or PO supplementation with protein as he was meeting [**1-26**] of protein daily intake requirement.
In speaking with the outpatient oncologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 116**], she did not recommend placement of feeding tube, given that goal was for palliative chemotherapy to reduce gastric tumor burden, potentially allowing patient to tolerate increased PO intake.
IVF was provided to help keep patient hydrated along with PO protein supplementation.
#) Probable CAD: Patient with inferior Q waves that correlate with inferior wall motion abnormality on stress imaging; echo with mild left regional systolic dysfunction.
Held ASA given recent GI bleed and simvastatin given shock liver.
#) HTN: Patient on metoprolol for rate control; patient's BP was stable prior to discharge in normotensive range.
#) HLP: Held statin given shock liver, and did not restart on discharge.
#) GERD: Patient was initially on Protonix 40mg IV BID per above in setting of recent GIB, and he was transitioned to an oral PPI prior to discharge.

You did not require surgery to remove the clot, as your heart rate and blood pressure stabilized with fluids and medications.
Studies showed that you have blood clots in both of your legs, and you have a filter placed to help prevent these clots from breaking off and going to your lungs.
You were started on a blood thinner called enoxaparin (Lovenox), which you will continue to be on after you leave the hospital.
You will continue to take these medications after you leave the hospital.
Your blood counts were very low, and you a blood transfusion before you were discharged.
CHANGED metoprolol to metoprolol succinate 50 mg once daily 2.
STARTED digoxin 0.125 mg daily 3.
STARTED enoxaparin 80mg injected subcutaneouly every 12 hours 4.
STARTED a multivitamin 6.
You should continue to take tylenol as needed for pain and ondansetron as needed for nausea.
