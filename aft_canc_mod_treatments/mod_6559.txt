She received activated charcoal on transfer.
She received hypertonic Na and IV bicarb to overcome fast Na channel antagonism, intralipid infusion for improving volume of distribution.
She was put on a Na bicarbonate drip to maintain pH > 7.45 and keep QRS <130.

She was started on propofol gtt and and TCA overdose was treated.
# Pancreatitis: Patient was found to have elevated lipase and amylase [**12-27**] in the setting of low-grade fevers and leukocytosis, most likely due to prolonged sedation with propofol.
# Hypokalemia: associated with TCA overdose treatment and movement of K across cell membrane.
Tox recommended keeping K > 3 with supplemental potassium.
She was given a lidocaine bolus of 100mg with instructions to rebolus if recurrent despite NaHCO3 drip.
Her vent settings were changes as needed.
