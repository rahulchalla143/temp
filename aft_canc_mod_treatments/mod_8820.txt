Admission Date:  [**2116-5-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-5-28**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: fever, chest pain, shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal Intubation Central Venous Line Arterial Line Foley Catheter Bronchoscopy  History of Present Illness: 84M poor historian, with h/o multiple myeloma, COPD, PE, who by report, presented to [**Hospital1 882**] ED earlier today after developing left side SSCP while at the Infusion Center where he was receiving Velcade infusion for multiple myeloma.
He then developed a fever, cough, and chest discomfort in the setting of of blood transfusion, raising concern for transfusion reaction.
He was treated empirically with CTX, azithromycin.
Regarding CP, he received aspirin 325mg, with plan for additional blood tranfusions to maintain HCT >30 given question of ischemia.
O2 sats were 100% on NRB, and he was given 20mg lasix, started on heparing gtt, and given 1U PRBC for HCT 27.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management given lack of beds.
He was continued on heparin gtt, and empirically given vanc/zosyn x 1 for a presumed pulmonary source, along with solumedrol 125mg iv x 1.
Past Medical History: - Multipe myeloma - long standing, failed alkeran/prednisone, started on velcade on [**2116-5-14**], followed at [**Company 2860**].
- CAD s/p left LAD stent - Atrial fibrillation - Sick sinus syndrome s/p PPM placement - COPD (not on home O2) - Bladder ca s/p resection - Infrarenal AAA and renal aneurysm - H/o PE - CRI (baseline creatinine 2.0 [**2115-9-17**]) - Hyperlipidemia  Social History: Lives with son, who is very involved in health care, widower, unknown smoking hx, no recent EtOH  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Vitals: 97.7 89 89/52 24 94%3L -> 89%RA.
Calcification in the right main pulmonary artery peripherally likely represents chronic PE.
Right main pulmonary artery dilation to 3.1 cm likely represents pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Calcified hilar lymph nodes likely represent the sequela of prior granulomatous disease.
He received vanc/zosyn and solumedrol empirically given concern for neutropenic fever.
It is possible that resp distress occured in setting of pneumonia with fever accompanied by poor rate ctrl in pt with afib and baseline cardiomyopathy, which was further exacerbated by delivery of IV fluids at OSH per pt history.
Continued treatment for pneumonia given question of LLL infiltrate on CXR.
However, as not neutropenic with only first dose of velcade today, abx pared back to ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
Given low likelihood of pulmonary embolus on V/Q scan and ruling out for MI by cardiac enzymes, heparin gtt discontinued.
Also discontinued steroids as thought to have poor air movement at baseline with COPD but no acute exacerbation; continued home meds.
Patient was treated for two days on the floor until he developed progressive dyspnea and tachypnea and required readmission to the ICU.
On arrival, patient was intubated for respiratory distress.
CXR showed the development of a right lung consolidation with rapid progression of airspace disease on CT chest.
Nasal swab for influenza returned positive.
Treatment for influenza with oseltamavir was initiated as well as broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and meropenem for health-care associated pneumonia.
Initiation of hemodialysis was discussed with patient's HCP and it was decided that hemodialysis was not consistent with the patient's wishes.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Baseline creatinine 2.0 in [**2115-9-17**],  Creatinine remained under baseline until patient was transferred back to the MICU when he developed anuric renal failure in the setting of septic shock.
Discussed with family that hemodialysis was not consistent with the patient's goals of care.
Hemodialysis was not initiated.
# Multiple myeloma: Long standing, failed alkeran/prednisone and started on velcade on [**2116-5-14**], followed at [**Company 2860**].
Heparin gtt discontinued and not transfused blood for Hct <30 as no evidence of ongoing ischemia.
# Atrial fibrillation: Rate-controlled afib, on coumadin on admission.
S/p PPM for sick sinus syndrome which was confirmed to be functioning properly by EP.
Switched from atenolol to metoprolol given question of renal failure with goal to titrate to HR 60s.
Coumadin continued for goal INR [**1-14**].
