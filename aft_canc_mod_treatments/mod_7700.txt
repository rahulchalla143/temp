Double-lumen right central venous catheter in unchanged position.
The ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and configuration for patient's age.
On this admission, he presented fever and was empirically started on vancomycin and cefepime.
He was started on foscarnet empirically on [**10-10**], but this was stopped when CSF studies came back negative for HHV6.
# Submassive pulmonary embolus - The patient developed acute hypoxemia on [**10-14**], was found to have a large pulmonary embolus involving the right main with extension into the upper, middle, and lower segmental arteries, and was started on a heparin drip.
LENI showed bilateral deep venous thrombi, so he was brought emergently to the cath lab for IVC filter placement.
He was brought to the CCU after his thrombectomy and did well.
He he was maintained on heparin drip because of thrombocytopenia.
Once he was able to maintain his platelet count with every other day platelet transfusions, he was started on subcutaneous lovenox.
He developed bleeding complications and was found to be supratherapeutic with the 1mg/kg [**Hospital1 **] dosing of enoxaparin, so he was placed on 1mg/kg DAILY enoxaparin, and factor Xa levels were appropriate.
- Anticoagulation should be continued for 6 months for provoked pulmonary embolus, and IVC filter should be removed at the same time (around [**2133-5-15**])  # Fever - Had one isolated fever 101.3 on [**10-12**].
He was started empirically on vancomycin, cefepime.
Most concerning was HHV6 encephalitis, so he was started empirically on foscarnet as described below.
Because he remained afebrile and his WBC counts recovered, antibiotics were stopped on [**10-14**], and he remained afebrile.
# Ph + ALLO s/p double cord transplant: On Protocol #11-085, reduced intensity conditioning with fludarabine, melphalan, and low dose TBI followed by double umblical cord blood SCT (D 0 [**2132-7-2**]).
Discharged on [**2132-9-16**] after a prolonged hospitalization and is recovering slowly.
Counts remain low and seem to fluctuate somewhat in the setting of his medications and infections.
- We continued his anti-rejection regimen with methylprednisolone, sirolimus, and tacrolimus.
- Prophylaxis was continued with atovaquone, fluconazole.
CSF studies were positive for elevated protein, consistent with possible aseptic meningitis, so he was started on foscarnet, but was discontinued when CSF HHV6 was confirmed negative.
# CMV viremia - He is on valgancyclovir prophylaxis at home.
# Orthostatic hypotension:  The patient has a h/o orthostatic hypotension on fludrocortisone at home.
# Diabetes: Patient developed hypoglycemia while tapering methylprednisone, so home glargine was decreased from 30U to 4U, and he was maintained on a sliding scale with humalog.
TRANSITION OF CARE - Please keep platelets > 60,000 while on lovenox - CMV levels should be drawn on Friday, [**10-31**], and the dose of valgancyclovir may be changed accordingly - Continue lovenox for 6 months after provoked pulmonary embolus (until [**2133-5-15**]) - IVC filter should be removed in 6 months by interventional cardiology (around [**2133-5-15**])  MEDICATION CHANGES - DECREASE dose of tacrolimus to 0.5 mg twice daily - DECREASE dose of methylprednisone to 2mg daily - DECREASE dose of glargine insulin to 4U each night - START enoxaparin injections 90mg DAILY for 6 months (until [**2133-5-15**]) - START pantoprazole 40mg daily to protect your stomach from bleeding while you are on lovenox  Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.

We did not identify a clear source of your fevers but they resolved without antibiotics upon discharge.
You were treated briefly with foscarnet but the spinal fluid did not grow HHV6, so we stopped the foscarnet.
You were placed on a heparin IV until your platelet counts were adequate, then we started you on enoxaparin (lovenox) shots.
