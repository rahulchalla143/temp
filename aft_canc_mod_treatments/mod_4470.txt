CT of the chest revealed large bilateral consolidations, and the patient was started on broad antibiotic coverage for hospital acquired pneumonia, including vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
The patient underwent lumbar puncture with IR guidance, which yielded ~15 cc of bloody CSF.
Initial gram stain on the CSF revealed gram negative rods, and ampicillin was added for potential listeria meningitis, in the event that the gram negative rods reported on gram stain were actually gram variable.
Infectious disease was consulted prior to the above CT findings, and initially recommended holding antibiotic therapy, as well as sending a number of serologic infectious studies (HSV PCR in CSF, VZV PCR, West [**Doctor First Name **] PCR, Eastern Equine Encephalitis PCR, enteroviral PCR, mycoplasma PCR, VDRL per ID).
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics that were eventually tapered to doxycyline.
He also underwent bone marrow biopsy; pathology is pending.
# Leukocytosis: The patient had reportedly undergone bone marrow aspiration at the OSH, with findings consistent with myelodysplastic syndrome.
Hematology/oncology was consulted and performed another bone marrow aspiration to further assess the leukocytosis.
# Hypercalcemia: Calcium was highly elevated at OSH, where he received pamidronate treatment prior to transfer.
His calcium trended downwards after receiving pamidronate.
# Hypotension: Per patient's family, he has never had difficulty with high or low blood pressures, and was not on home anti-hypertensives.
He was initially placed on maintenance IV fluids, and subsequently had the rate of infusion increased.
He transiently required vasopressors while in the unit.
# HIT:  His HIT antibody returned positive and he was started on Argatroban.
# Respiratory failure:  Patient required intubation on [**9-19**].
This was due to ARDS; he was initiated on ARDSnet ventilation.
He had difficultly oxygenating and required high PEEPs directed by balloon.
