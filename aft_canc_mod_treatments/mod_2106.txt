Of note, the patient had been taking ibuprofen 200 mg p.o.
He was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and electively intubated for preparation for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

When transfusing 1 unit of packed red blood cells, the patient developed fever and tremors, and the transfusion was stopped.
The patient's mean cell volume was also elevated, and given his history of alcohol use, he was given thiamine and folate q.d.

It was thought that the patient had subacute bacterial peritonitis; however, pretreatment with ciprofloxacin may have influenced the Gram stain/culture results.
He was treated with cefotaxime as well as ciprofloxacin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
After initial paracentesis fluid reaccumulated the following day, and he was sent for ultrasound-guided paracentesis.
Due to acute presentation of ascites over the period of this month, the patient underwent Duplex Doppler of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out portal vein thrombosis.
He is status post radiofrequency ablation in [**2168-5-21**], but he declined any chemotherapy or embolization.
Therefore, he was treated empirically for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with a combination of ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime.
