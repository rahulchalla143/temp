MRA imaging of her carotid arteries was also performed on [**3-4**] which showed no evidence of high-grade internal carotid artery stenosis.
On exam on [**3-2**], she was started on a heparin drip because of concerns for arterial stenosis.
Because the patient's hematocrit dropped and was low during this admission, she did require a transfusion of packed red blood cells.
Her stools were guaiac positive, and she was put on Protonix prophylaxis while she was here, which should be continued while she is on any sort of blood thinners because of this history of GI bleed.
The patient's heparin drip was adjusted with a goal to keep the PTT between 50 and 70 with frequent checks.
The patient continued to do well with gradual improvement in her language abilities and her strength, and we will plan for discharge of the patient.
