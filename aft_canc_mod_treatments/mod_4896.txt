Admission Date:  [**2166-7-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-8-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2096-11-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Percodan  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**] Chief Complaint: need for possible esophageal and Y-stent placement  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Radiation therapy to lung mass   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 87136**] is a 69 year-old man with COPD and newly diagnosed right lower lobe poorly differentiated NSCLC w/ bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy and obstruction of the esophagus and distal trachea and bilateral mainstem bronchi.
He was initially transferred to the MICU from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital after being admitted on [**2166-7-16**] for evaluation for esophageal and Y-stent placement for compressive lung mass.
He had a PEG tube placed on [**2166-7-17**].
He was managed with duonebs, IV solumedrol and azithromycin at the OSH, though his respiratory status continued to decline.
In the MICU, he was started empirically on vanc/unasyn for aspiration pneumonia and seen by IP.
They felt that his hypoxia was most likely secondary to right pulmonary artery compression from the mediastinal mass/LAD, and did not feel that he would benefit from Y-stent placement.
However, if one were placed, they recommended evaluation for simultaneous esophageal stent placement.
They also recommended chest CTA to rule out PE (he previously had chest CT with contrast at OSH but was not protocoled for PE per report), and urgent rad onc consult.
He is transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] today for initiation of radiation simulation and with first session of XRT to begin this afternoon.

Status post PEG insertion due to significant compromise of the esophagus by lymphadenopathy.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 y/o gentleman with RLL NSCLC and extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy that is compressing the esophagus, left lower lobe segmental bronchi, and right pulmonary artery; he was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] while he completed his radiation course.
[**Name2 (NI) 87137**]/Hypoxia:  New diagnosis of lung cancer with involvement of mediastinum and compression of right pulmonary artery, distal trachea, bilateral mainstem bronchi, and esophagus.
Transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for expedited XRT and monitoring during therapy.
Pain control recs were left and followed and a discussion was started about long term plans.
Pain, right chest, tumor-related: Fentanyl patch, as needed morphine.
5mg of IV metoprolol x 2 slowed rate to 110-120s but not further and BP bottomed to 90s/60s.
Metoprolol was changed to QID.
Discharged on Metoprolol 50mg PO Q8hrs.
Concern for DVT or SVC syndrome as come evidence of SVC compression on chest CT. U/S RUE showed occlusive clot of cephalic vein (superficial vein) but no DVT.
COPD:  Initially treated for COPD exacerbation at OSH with azithro and solumedrol.
Pt was kept on standing ipratropium/albuterol + PRN albuterol for SOB but steroids were discontinued per rad onc request while on XRT.
Rad Onc okayed NSAIDs during therapy so high dose Ibuprofen was started in addition to standing opiods.
HTN: On metoprolol mostly for rate control.

Discharge Instructions: You were managed at the [**Hospital1 69**] with radiation therapy for your Lung Cancer.
You developed complication with an irregular heart rhythm called Atrial Fibrillation that is controlled with a medication called Metoprolol.
We decided to leave in the gastric tube that you use for supplemental tube feeding because it may be useful for medicine administration and food supplementation and because you did not mind having it left in.
You will transition to a skilled nursing facility to continue receiving care and support for your medical issues.
