Per neurosurg, okay to start heparin without bolus.
Due to his hemodynamic stability, the patient was transferred to the floor where he was transitioned from Heparin to Lovenox.
He received lower extremity noninvasive ultrasound studies demonstrating no clot in the deep veins of his lower extremities, and therefore did NOT receive an IVC filter.
His oxygen was successfully weaned to RA.
Physical and occupational therapy evaluated Mr. [**Known lastname **] and deemed him to be independent.
High concern for ICH bleed given surgery 2 wks ago.
After discussing the need for anticoagulation with neurosurgery, the primary team in the MICU anticoagulated Mr. [**Known lastname **] on heparin.
Patient receives ongoing care as previously described with neuro and radiation oncology.
