Ill defined, heterogenously enhancing material in the right anterior paraspinal soft tissues at T6-7 suspiucious for phlegmon.
Given history of recent septicemia, findings highly suspicious for infectious osteomyelitis of the bilateral L3-4 facet joints with adjacent abscesses in the posterior paraspinal soft tissues.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 62 year old male with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, plasma cell dysplasia with Kappa light chains and cryoglobulinemia treated in [**2127**], now s/p relapse and retreatment [**2130-2-6**] with resultant tumor lysis syndrome, acute on chronic kidney failure, and hospitalization at [**Hospital 22913**] from [**2130-2-10**] to [**2130-2-19**] complicated by development of MSSA septicemia, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
After a lengthy and complicated hospital course, his care was transitioned to comfort measures only and he was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] health.
# Goals of care: given overwhelming sepsis and multiple sources of infection, goals of care discussion was held with his health care proxy and his care was transitioned to comfort measures only.
Pain was managed with methadone IV standing and hydromorphone IV bolus as needed.
On admission the patient was hypotensive requiring 3 pressors and epinephrine injection for support.
He had positive cultures for MSSA in blood from OSH, as well as urine, knee aspirate, and sputum cultures at [**Hospital1 18**].
Infectious Disease was consulted and recommended an extended treatment course with Nafcillin.
His blood pressure and urine output improved and his need for pressors resolved.
CT Surgery was consulted and recommended weekly TTEs to monitor for interval change.
He was treated with Nafcillin extended course as above.
After goals of care discussion with HCP, care was transitioned to comfort measures only and antibiotics were discontinued.
# Septic Arthritis: He had a septic right knee with purulent aspiration with serial bedside washes and OR washout on [**2130-2-23**] with arthrotomy with debridement, lavage, and synovectomy, as well as irrigation and debridement of his left elbow bursa.
Given persistent fevers, leukocytosis, and tachycardia he returned to the OR on [**2130-3-1**] for repeat right knee wash out.
# Left thigh fluid collection: A 30cm x 10cm area of erythemia was noted over the lateral aspect of his left thigh.
Given goals of care, symptomatic management with pain control was performed.
Chest CT on [**2130-2-20**] showed upper lobe consolidation and his sputum grew MSSA, for which he was continued on Nafcillin.
He was also found to have a right pneumothorax on CT and a chest tube was placed by IP.
His respiratory status improved and he was extubated on [**2130-2-24**] and transitioned to supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.
Chest tube remained in place due to persistent bronchopleural fistula.
Tube was discontinued after goals of care discussion.
He was started on an IV PPI and transfused as needed to maintain a Hct >25 and plts > 50.
GI was consulted who noted stable HCT and recommended against EGD and continued medical management with pantoprazole.
His TLS has since improved, with uric acid at OSH from high of 11 down to 2.3, however elevated >8 at [**Hospital1 18**].
His urine output was initially low, but after volume resuscitation he began to autodiurese with improvement in his UOP to greater than 100cc/hr.
# Multiple Myeloma/Cryoglobulinemia: Last treatment was [**2130-2-6**], which resulted in TLS.
He was initially on stress dose steroids which were tapered off given the hematologic results.
He was started on Methadone 20 mg IV Q6H to wean off his Fentanyl and Midazolam drips.
