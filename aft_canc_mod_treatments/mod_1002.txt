His INR was reversed with vitamin K and 4 units of FFP.
He received a total of 10 units of PRBC as well.
He likely is having embolic events from his a fib and lack of anticoagulation given his severe GI bleed.
He was put back on anticoagulation with lovenox and coumadin.
He will need lovenox until his INR is therapeutic for 2 days (therapeutic for the first time [**2112-5-20**]).
His beta blocker was held given his hypotension on admission and his GI bleed.
He was treated for 4 days with ciprofloxacin before leukopenia complicated the picture.
The Ciprofloxacin was discontinued and his WBC trended back up.
This was likely a pre-renal azotemia and resolved with volume expansion with IVF and blood products.
His coumadin was held given the GI bleeding and supratherapeutic INR.
Used an insulin SS while in house.
## Hypernatremia - Most likely volume depletion from blood loss as it resolved with correction of fluid status.
