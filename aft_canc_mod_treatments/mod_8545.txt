Patient had pigtail placed on [**12-1**].
Of note, patient was just recently admitted from [**Date range (2) 100990**] with pontine abscess.
She was treated with multiple antibiotics but eventually responded to penicillin G for suspicion of Listeria.
She was intubated and trached because of that.
She was also treated for MRSA and stenotrophomonas PNA with vancomycin and bactrim.

15 cc of Gastrografin was subsequently infused through the gastrostomy tube and immediate scan of the gastrostomy site was performed followed by delayed imaging of the abdomen and pelvis.
The gastrostomy tube appears outside of the stomach lumen and is positioned posterior to the greater curvature of the stomach.
The percutaneous gastrostomy tube appears extraluminal and is located posterior to the stomach.

Brief Hospital Course: Hospital Course: 73yo F with history of metastatic breast cancer, atrial fibrillation on coumadin and amiodarone, GIB from AVM, ulcerative colitis with ileostomy, adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy, transferred from rehab for hypotension: .
Pt had had R thoracentesis and pigtail cath placed on the day before admission.
She was treated with aggressive IVF for the first several days of admission, with response in her BP.
Pt had pancreatitis with elevated amylase/lipase, and was treated with IVF, NPO, analgesia, but Hct was stable.
For possible meningitis, pt was started on empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
Pt was placed on stress dose steroids on [**2111-12-6**], since she takes prednisone 10 QD for UC.
She will likely need chronic vent facility.
She was also evaluated by IP for a tracheal stent and they recommended that if she has problems with trach again, she will likely need a longer (length of trach) rather than a stent.
Creatinine was monitored during the stay as she was on lasix drip, see below.
##  4+ Anasarca: Patient was given aggressive IVF on admission, with resultant 5+ pitting edema.
After stabilization of BP and treatment of infection and weaning off of Levophed, patient was diuresed gently with Lasix gtt.
The edema however did not resolve with lasix gtt.
Starting [**2112-1-16**] her creatinine started to increase and lasix gtt was held.
##  Hct decrease: Patient required blood transfusion every week prior to admission.
Surgery was consulted who suggested monitoring the hematoma as there would be a chance of wound infeciton.
Given her anemia of chronic disease she should be started on epogen after discharge from hospital.
##  Atrial Fibrillation: Metoprolol and Diltiazem did not work well for patient's AFIB, because her BP would decrease below 80.
She was started on Amiodarone with reasonable rate control in the 100s.
Anxiety (Ativan) and pain (dilaudid, morphine, percocet) medications also served to decrease patient's HR.
Pt ordinarily took Coumadin as an outpatient, but coumadin was held during admission, for hematocrit drop as above.
##  Diabetes mellitus 2: Patient was maintained on insulin gtt, and then insulin sliding scale starting [**12-3**] until discharge.
##  R chronic endophthalmitis/R retinal detachment: Ophthalmology agreed that pt would not undergo surgery to correct her retinal detachment, and would not require further antibiotics intravitreally.
Patient was maintained on 4 eyedrops and erythromycin ointment as outpatient.
It is believed that her pleural effusions are associated with her breast ca.
##  Ulcerative colitis with ileostomy: Patient was admitted on Prednisone 10 QD.
GI was consulted, who confirmed that pt does not require prednisone for her UC since her colon has been resected.
Patient was treated by NPO, IVF, and Dilaudid, morphine, percocet for pain control.
## UTI: Episode of pseudomonas UTI, treated with ceftaz for 7 days, last day ~[**2111-1-14**].
IR was consulted and placed a PEG tube under floro guidance.
##  Communication: HCP (brother) [**Name (NI) 429**] [**Name (NI) 33962**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 100992**])  On [**1-14**] /[**2111**]  percutaneos G tube was attempted and it was felt not to be optimal procedure for this reason it was further studied and found to have a leak for this reason several days it was observed by the IR and medical ICU team, following that the tube and then manipulated and interrogated and found to have a leak again on [**1-18**], on [**1-22**] a CT scan was ordered and the results were called to the team that the G-tube was freely out in the peritoneum.
After extensive discussion that the patient was in grave state and needed to have emergency surgery for a likely gastric perforation :this was  repaired on the evening on [**1-22**] into the early morning of [**1-23**].
On [**1-26**] a dialysis line was placed for pending dialysis.
After placement of the dialysis line she continued to have spetic appearing physiology but had an additional pressor and blood requirement having a crit drop of several units.
She continued to progress and have failure of all organ systems having a continued blood product requirement from potential retroperitoneal bleed related to line placement, DIC related to sepsis, and vent dependent pulmonary failure, as well as acute renal failure all the while on maximum pressor suport.
Again extensive discussion was undertaken with her kind and responsive family who felt as if they were being consistent with her wishes to continue until it was reached that the most important goal of therapy could no longer bring meaningful survival.
After this discussion was undertaken the patient was made comfort measures only and the ionotropic support was weened and the patient expired shortly after with her family present at the bedside  Medications on Admission: Prevacid 30g per NG tube [**Hospital1 **] CaCO3 500mg per NG erythromycin Xopenex atrovent folic acid lopressor 75mg Q8h Digoxin 0.125 RISS coumadin prednisone 10mg QD zofran prn percocet prn renagel 1600mg 3x/day ertapenem 1g Q12 through [**2111-12-5**] coumadin   Discharge Medications: none  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: sepsis, metastatic breast cancer, blood loss anemia, ventdependent respiratory failure, pontine abscess, acute renal failure, cardiomyopathy, shock liver, gastric perforation, failure to thrive , malnutrition, TPN dependence, HTN, ocular infection,  Discharge Condition: none  Discharge Instructions: none  Followup Instructions: none   Completed by:[**2112-1-27**
