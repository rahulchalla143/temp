Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old female with stage IV lung cancer, CAD s/p MI, T2DM, Afib, and HTN who presents with new right sided PE and increased O2 requirement.
Ativan and maalox fixed the CP, and the SOB improved once patient's HR was decreased with IV lopressor, and then we uptitrated pt's metoprolol to 25mg TID to better control her afib.
She was given SL NTG, but this did not help as much as controlling her HR.
She remained hemodynamically stable throughout each of her episodes, although she did drop her BP to the low 90's after she was given 2 SL NTG and lopressor at the same time, but this quickly resolved with IVF.
She will need to be weaned back to her home dose of 2L NC O2 as tolerated.
Pneumonia: Initially on Levoflox for CAP on admission, but as Ms. [**Known lastname **] had been recently hospitalized and then in rehab for an extended period, we felt this was not adequate tx.
Moderate right sided pleural effusion noted on CT scan could represent an empyema, however, this has been noted on prior CT scans making this less likely.
She will need to complete a 14 day course of antibiotics (last dose 5/7).
We stopped her home atenolol and put her on metoprolol instead which was uptitrated to 25mg TID and her HR was controlled on these medications in the 100-120's.
