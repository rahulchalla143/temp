He had a pacemaker/defibrillator placed in [**2114**] for primary prevention; he had an episode of VTach in [**2115**] causing syncope and was begun on amiodarone (d/c'd) and then procainamide since 4/[**2116**].
At baseline he can walk the length of a long corridor without significant SOB.
Past Medical History: # CAD s/p large anterior MI at age 36; # 2 vessel CABG [**2101**] LIMA to LAD; SVG to OM # NSTEMI [**10/2114**] s/p stent to native L circ.
# CHF with LV EF of 25% # Ventricular Tachycardia: had pacemaker placed in [**2114**] for primary prevention (MADIT criteria); had [**Hospital1 18**] hospitalization [**3-26**] (started on amio; d/c'd due to "balance disorder/falls"), started on procainamide [**12/2116**]; decreased from 1000mg tid to 500mg tid with level 7.2 on [**10-15**].
?L arm emolism; on coumadin since [**7-/2116**] # B achilles tendon rupture [**12-24**] ciprofloxacin # Prostate CA: s/p brachytherapy # osteoarthritis (currently taking prednisone) .
Brief Hospital Course: A/P 82 yo with CAD s/p old IMI, 2 vessel CABG in [**2101**], NSTEMI in [**2113**] with stent to native L circ, CHF with EF 25-30%, VT s/p ICD placement presenting with recurrent VT.
He had successful ablation of LV scar but this procedure was complicated by pericardial effusion/tamponade.
His procainamide dose was increased to 750mg po tid  (goal proc level 8) with similar metoprolol dose at 50mg toprol XL daily.
He had a successful VT ablation with mapping complicated by bloody pericardial effusion/tamponade and groin bleed (see below).
His pacemaker was reset to 80 bpm; there has been an advisory on his specific pacemaker and he was instructed to place a magnet to it daily to ensure that it is working correctly.
Mr [**Known lastname 95741**] ablation was complicated by hemorrhagic effusion causing tamponade requiring pericardial drain (140cc off).
The drain was pulled and repeat eccho initially showed some small reaccumulation which was subsuquently stable with no evidence tamponade.
-- CAD: s/p IMI at age 36, CABG [**2103**] with SVG to OM and LIMA to LAD, NSTEMI [**2113**] with PTCA to L circ;  He was kept on metoprolol, losartan, aspirin, and statin -- Pump: baseline of EF 25-30%; symptomatically NYHA class II.
During hospitalization had several episodes of hypotension, one resolving with draining of pericardial fluid, one with a NS bolus of 500cc and dopamine.
Thought to be in setting of tamponade phsyiology and hypovolemia.
This resolved quickly and he has been normotense on home antihypertensive regimen (metoprolol XL 50, losartan 25) for several days prior to discharge.
Direct pressure and pressure dressing applied with good effect.
Anticoagulation was reversed with FFP, a small amount of vit K and protamine.
He did not require any pRBC transfusion.
His anticoagulation was discontinued (as below).
# L arm thrombosis: Discontinued anticoagulation as he has been anticoagulated for over 6 mos and likely no further indication.
# Arthritis: continued prednisone as per outpatient PCP (although this is not likely an appropriate regimen).
# Prostate CA: outpt managmement, continued home medications of flomax and detrol.
Put back on outpt lasix dose on discharge.

You had a procedure to ablate your ventricular tachycardia and had the complication of some fluid around your heart called "cardaic tamponade".
You then had a drain placed into your heart sac which was removed.

YOu should continue with a low sodium diet (2grams per day) and weigh yourself daiy; if you gain >2lbs or if you have trouble breathing you should contact your doctor.
