Admission Date: [**2173-6-23**]        Discharge Date: [**2173-6-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-8-12**]        Sex:  M  Service:  [**Last Name (un) 7081**]   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of right lower lobe stage III, non-small- cell lung cancer of the squamous type who has had two cycles of induction chemotherapy initiated on [**2172-12-22**] and radiation therapy times six weeks.
The patient was planning to have a surgical resection on [**2173-4-26**] but developed a small bowel obstruction requiring an emergent exploratory laparotomy.
He was discharged to rehabilitation at that time and was home for three weeks prior to his current admission.
The patient was thought to have a poor prognosis despite the addition of surgical therapy; but nonetheless, after discussions with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] and the patient's wife, the patient opted for further surgery.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Right lower lobe stage III non-small- cell lung cancer of the squamous type; status post radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
Metoprolol 100 mg twice per day.
Lisinopril 2.5 mg once per day.
Protonix 40 mg once per day.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2173-6-23**] the patient underwent a right pneumonectomy, a radical mediastinal lymph node dissection with a muscle flap.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Postoperatively, the patient remained hypotensive with a blood pressure of 94/62 on a Neo-Synephrine drip.
As a consequence, the patient was placed on vancomycin and was transitioned to linezolid on discharge for a total of a 10- day course.
On postoperative day two, the patient's chest tube was removed but he continued to require Neo-Synephrine to maintain his blood pressure at 99/57.
His pulse remained high at 109, and his hematocrit slowly drifted down from a preoperative value of 37.8 to 25.9 on postoperative day three; at which point the patient received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells.
By postoperative day three, the patient's epidural was taken out and he was started on a morphine patient-controlled analgesia.
Diuresis was begun with Lasix, and the patient was receiving aggressive chest physical therapy.
On postoperative day five, the patient was switched to oral pain medications.
Chest physical therapy was continued, and the patient was begun on Lopressor for his tachycardia.
On postoperative day six, the patient continued to require aggressive chest physical therapy for his coarse breath sounds and a productive cough.
His metoprolol dose was increased ultimately to 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
On postoperative day seven, the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility with a 7-day course of linezolid and recommendation that the patient receive aggressive chest physical therapy and frequent walking.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Identical to the admission diagnoses listed in the Past Medical History with the addition of the following:  Status post right pneumonectomy, radical mediastinal lymph node dissection and muscle flap on [**2173-6-23**].
Linezolid 600 mg by mouth twice per day (times seven    days).
Percocet 5/325-mg tablets one to two tablets by mouth q.4-    6h.
