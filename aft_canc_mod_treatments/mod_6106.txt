male with PMHx of DM, HTN, CAD s/p IMI with 3 stents to RCA and recently diagnosed RCC who is transferred from [**Hospital **]for ongoing work-up of acute renal failure and change in mental status.
He ruled out for an MI with cardiac biomarkers and was felt to be constipated as was illustrated on CT and thought to be due to chronic narcotic use for lower back pain and right hip pain (awaiting hip replacement).
His constipation was treated aggressively with medications and disimpaction with minimal effect.
On day 4 of his hospitalization, he was febrile to 104 with a leukocytosis to 14 and was pan-cultured while Vancomycin and Zosyn were started empirically with specific concern for a PIV infection suggested by surrounding erythema and edema.
Blood cultures later grew GPCs in [**2-23**] bottles and chronic foot ulcers were swabbed and reportedly grew staph aureus with pending sensitivities.
He was started on Ceftriaxone 2 grams daily for CNS coverage though no LP was performed.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for concern of his renal failure progressing to the point of needing HD, since [**Hospital3 77641**] no HD facilities.
There was concern for seizing and patient was urgently intubated to protect his airway.

[**2165-4-21**] CXR: ET tube tip at the thoracic inlet is approximately 45 mm from the carina, standard position.
[**2165-4-21**] Left foot XR: The patient is status post partial amputation of the first through fifth metatarsals and resection of multiple phalanges.
Medications and metabolic disturbances may be causes but this pattern can also be seen in post-anoxic patients.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 year old male had prolonged hospital course complicated by multiple infections, mental status changes, and renal failure who requires long term antibiotic therapy.
# Sepsis/Meningitis:  He was transferred from [**Location (un) **] in the setting of high-grade MSSA bacterimia and mental status changes, and intubated on arrival because of question seizures and concern for airway protection.
Before speciation returned, he was initially managed with vancomycin and zosyn, and then switched to nafcillin given MSSA.
He also required pressors intermittently on the day after presenting but this was ultimately thought to represent a low-baseline blood pressure, and pressors were subsequently discontinued, with MAPs that remained greater than 65.
However, it was later performed and was consistent with bacterial meningitis, and antibiotics were changed to vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir.
ACV and CTX were then discontinued as CSF culture returned negative and other cultures continued to be MSSA.
Vancomycin was continued following transfer to floor.
As patient continued to improve clinically, the decision was made to treat empirically with vancomycin until [**6-5**], dosing during HD.
Following transfer to floor, fentanyl patch was discontinued in favor of morphine PO.
hypodense region in TT2 area of spinal cord:  Intial concern was for abscess with cord compression as patient was febrile with MSSA infection and not moving his lower extremities for several days pre-extubation [**2165-4-30**].
His vent settings were weaned and plan for extubation on [**5-1**] was moved up after he bit through the tubing to inflate the cuff.
Patient had stable respiratory for the duration of his hospitalization following extubation.
He had to be started on HD ([**2165-4-26**]) for volume overload and hyperkalemia.
He continued on HD and eventually a temporary dialysis catheter was placed (on [**5-2**])and the femoral HD catheter was pulled.
His urine output improved, although his need for HD continued.
The patient had another dialysis catheter placed on [**5-15**] for HD, with subsequent self-removal secondary to agitation.
A tunnelled catheter HD line was placed on [**2165-5-17**] for resumption of HD.
The patient continued receiving HD 3 times weekly on the floor, and pt's creatinine was 2.2 at time of discharge.
The patient will continue HD following discharge and will be followed by the nephrology service.
His losartan was held for renal protection in hopes that his renal function would recover.
He was started on metoprolol and hydralizine with better control.
Pt's HTN was managed well on the floor following ICU transfer with the current medication regimen at discharge.
ESR and CRP very high and will monitor with Abx treatment for osteomyelitis.
- no intervention was pursued, as patient improved clinically on floor on vancomycin - pt will have ID follow up on [**6-5**]  # Right hip OA: significant source of pain and had required large doses of narcotics prior to admission.
Morphine PO with scheduled tylenol proved an effective regimen for his pain.
General surgery was consulted and felt that it was improving and did not require surgical intervention.
He eventually began stooling again after PO narcan was started and with an aggressive bowel regimen.
Following transfer to floor, constipation resolved with bowel regimen and change in opiate use.
# CAD s/p IMI: Ruled out for MI at OSH and was continued on ASA/plavix.
He was not on a beta blocker or statin at home for unclear reasons.
# DM:  Managed initially with an insulin drip because of elevated finger sticks and converted to a sliding scale.
[**Last Name (un) **] consulted and placed patient on a basal bolus regimen with good control at time of discharge.
This regimen will be continued at rehab.
# Gout:  Renally-dosed Allopurinol and then d/c'd given renal failure.
