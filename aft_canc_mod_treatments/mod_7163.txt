X-rays were reportedly normal and he was given pain meds.
Psych was consulted and recommended antipsychotics for delerium/agitation.
Heme/Onc was also consulted for evaluation of tumor  Neurosurgeons at OSH feel the fracture is unstable and will need spinal surgery to stabilize, but are not comfortable preforming biopsy/stabilization procedure.
He was started on decadron on [**9-7**] with 10mg IV bolus.
His agitation has improved somewhat with antipsychotics and treatment of a UTI.
Patient was being treated with bactrim for UTI, but UCx grew enterococcus which was resistant to bactrim.
Past Medical History: # History of prostate cancer, diagnosed in [**2185**] and treated with brachytherapy, status post TURP in [**2188**] # Diabetes Mellitus, on insulin at home.
- on synthroid on transfer, TSH elevated at OSH  # Of note, OSH records report h/o gastrectomy and h/o cholecystectomy, but patient denies and no scars on exam   Social History: He is married with two grown children.
LUMBAR SPINE: FINDINGS: The T12 vertebra demonstrates signal changes with low T1 and high inversion recovery signal involving the anterior half of the vertebral body and posterior inferior quadrant of the vertebral body with uninvolved posterior superior portion of vertebral body and pedicles.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus.
Patient was initially monitored with neurologic exam q 8hrs and maintained on decadron 6mg IV q 6hrs to reduce edema.
Given his history of CHF, patient remained intubated following procedure and was transferred to the TSICU for further management.
He required neopsynephrine for approx 24 hrs following procedure and was maintained on 150cc/hr NS.
He was initially on propofol for sedative but this was changed to precedex for better management of agitation.
Postoperative pain managed with morphine bolus prn, transitioned to PRN PO morphine.
His behavior improved somewhat with antipsychotics and antibiotic therapy.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he was also noted to be intermittently confused, his behavior worsening after receiving ativan for an MRI.
Following surgical procedure, he became agitated while weaning off propofol gtt and was subsequently placed on precedex.
On the precedex gtt, he was noted to be somnolent/ inattentive and was subsequently transferred to the medical ICU for further evaluation/ management.
His mental status was thought to be secondary to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy from pain following the surgery, medication SE (on precedex gtt in setting hepatic insufficiency), hypoxemia from decompensated CHF/ anemia (see below), and communication difficulties (mainly portuguese- speaking patient).
Precedex gtt was discontinued and morphine was judiciously administered for pain control.
In the setting of aggressive volume and [**Hospital1 **] resuscitation during surgical procedure and post-operative care, patient became clinically hypervolemic.
Diuresed effectively with lasix 40mg IV prn with output of >1L over 24hrs.
Further diuresis initially held upon transfer to the medicine floor as pt had bump in Na, BUN, and Cr after ICU diuresis.
Following surgical procedure, [**Hospital1 **] sugars were better controlled on sliding scale insulin alone.
Had been treated empirically with bactrim at OSM before Cx data was back.
Cx ultimately showed enterococcus [**Last Name (un) 36**] to ampicillin but resistant to bactrim.
At arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] pt was started on ampicillin and completed course of therapy.
possibly euthyroid sick syndrome, vs subclinical hypothyroidism but pt had been started on low dose of synthroid at OSH and this was continued at [**Hospital1 18**] due to uncertainty around clinical situation.

There was concern that your spine bones would become unstable because of these masses and a surgery was performed to stabilize your spine and to obtain a biopsy of the tissue to allow diagnosis of the mass.
A large amount of [**Hospital3 **] was lost during the surgery and you required [**Hospital3 **] transfusions and a stay in the ICU after surgery.
Both before and after surgery you suffered from delirium which before surgery may have been triggered by ativan and after surgery by the effects of a large surgery.
-Lasix 40mg twice daily was STOPPED.
