Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**11-24**]-Thoracentesis   History of Present Illness: 56 yo male with PMH of multiple myeloma who was recently admitted with a pericardial effusion and tamponade (pulsus reportedly 24 mmHg) s/p pericardiocentesis and balloon pericardiotomy presents with increased shortness of breath.
Of note during the last admission, he was also found to have a large left pleural effusion on CT chest, but refused thoracentesis at that time.
He denies chest pain, pleuritic symptoms, orthopnea, PND, LE edema.
He denies bowel/bladder incontinence, urinary retention, numbness, tingling, or burning.
He also reports that his back pain is unchanged and remains a [**6-25**] decreased to [**1-18**] /10 with oxycontin and oxycodone.
CT of the torso demonstrated a large mass in the right posterior mediastinum and hemithorax destroying the transverse process of the vertebral body of T3 and T4 and ribs at that level.
IgG at that time was 8703, an SPEP showed an abnormal band representing 58%, and beta 2 microglobulin was 3.4.
Mr. [**Known lastname 54249**] was initially treated with steroids and radiation therapy, which started on [**2190-12-3**].
He was then seen as an outpatient following his radiation treatments.
He was diagnosed with a polyneuralgia and was started on folic acid and vitamin B12 subcutaneous monthly.
He was being maintained on fentanyl 75 mcg patch with oxycodone as needed for pain.
As such, his regimen was then changed to pulse Cytoxan along with pulse Decadron therapy 40 mg times four days on and four days off.
He was then treated with radiation therapy to his neck following an MRI, which ruled him out for any spinal cord compression.
He then [**Known lastname 1834**] stem cell mobilization with Cytoxan and [**Known lastname 1834**] autologous stem cell transplant with high-dose melphalan on [**2191-7-28**].
He overall tolerated his high-dose therapy well but had somewhat a slow recovery of his counts with now normal levels.
Although his presentation was certainly concerning for recurrent  MM, Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 54250**] refused further evaluation including bronchoscopy and biospsy, but simply wanted to be treated with more [**Name13 (STitle) 4387**].
Mr [**Known lastname 54249**] [**Last Name (Titles) 54251**], was ambulating with a cane and was discharged home with plans to followup as for outpatient  [**Last Name (Titles) 4387**].

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 56 year old male with PMH significant for relapsed multiple myeloma s/p auto BMT in [**7-/2191**] who presents with shortness of breath and lower extremity weakness.
The procedure was complicated by a small pneumothorax which resolved with 100% FIO2 by face mask.
The patient became less short of breath after the therapeutic thoracentesis was performed.
He was then able to maintain an oxygen saturation of 94-97% on 2 Liters (baseline on previous admission).
No further management of the effusion or therapy for the shortness of breath was performed.
Since weakness in his legs was worsening and conscious sedation by anesthesia could not be arranged for the same day, the patient was given 2.5 mg Xanax and sent down to MRI.
He was started on decadron (40 mg) for possible spinal cord compression due to the mediastinal mass/cervical mass.
The following morning the patient was placed under conscious sedation for an MRI of his head and spine.
The patient's dose of steroids was changed to 6 mg IV q 6 hours and he [**Hospital Unit Name 1834**] emergent XRT of the spine.
The patient had XRT x 2, but became more confused prior to the third session and began to refuse all therapies, including xrt and a central line placement.
It was decided to make the patient DNR/DNI with comfort measures and to have the patient placed in inpatient hospice.
His steroids were tapered off.
#Pain control - On the first few days of admission, the patient's pain was fairly well controlled with oxycontin 60 mg [**Hospital1 **], with occassional oxycodone for breakthrough.
The patient then started to have increasing pain, not controlled with PO medication alone.
He was started on a 75 mcg fentanyl patch with a fentanyl pca for breakthrough.
As the patient's confusion progressed, he did not push the PCA button for medication and he refused peripheral access, so his regimen was changed to an increased dose of fentanyl by transdermal patch with roxinol for breakthrough pain.
He  #Hematuria - While the patient was in the ICU, he had a foley catheter placed.
A third dose was not administered as the patient was put on best supportive measures only.
He was originally put on fentanyl patch with morphine for breakthrough pain, but his pain increased and he was eventually started on a morphine drip.
