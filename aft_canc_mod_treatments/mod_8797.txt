An intravenous pyelogram was done with tomography with finding of widened bladder neck, otherwise, normal.
The patient was sent from the Emergency Room where her vital signs were stable to the Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Suite where it was revealed an abnormal mucosa in the esophagus from 30 cm to 22 cm distally with adherent clot and moderate oozing.
MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Aricept 5 mg po q.d., Lipitor 10 mg po q.d., Prempro .625/2.5 mg q.d., Centrum multivitamin.
O2 saturation 100% on two liters nasal cannula.

She was started on Vitamin K subcutaneous injections times three days and her coagulation laboratories normalized by the time of discharge.
However, a CT scan was done of her torso showing mediastinal lymphadenopathy, right hilar adenopathy, dilation of esophagus with air fluid level in the distal esophagus and distal esophageal wall markedly thickened beyond TE junction suspicious for malignancy.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and her oncologist also felt that were no aggressive therapeutic measures to be done at this point, however, at a later time, if she becomes more symptomatic in terms of her swallowing or breathing, there may be room for palliative radiation or stenting placement in her esophagus.
Aricept was held given her esophageal ulcerations.
