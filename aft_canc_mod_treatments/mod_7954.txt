The patient was given five days of Ciprofloxacin after the stent procedure.
Pt notes his chemo regimen was changed last week.
Of note, he was discharged fromt he hospital recently on [**2155-9-18**] with for three weeks of puritis, anorexia, fatigue, and jaundice due to biliary obstruction secondary secondary to metatstic colon cancer, with an ultrasound showing liver mets leading to bile duct obscturtion, for which he was taken to ERCP [**2155-9-17**] with successful placement of metal stent.
Past Medical History: Colon CA Dx [**2144**] Tx with colectomy only with anastamosis Repalse of disease in [**2150**] with metastasis to liver and lung s/p TACE and multiple chemotherapy regimens last dose 8/11.
Ertapenem 0.023 MCG/ML, SENSITIVE : Sensitivity testing performed          by Etest , REQUESTED BY DR.[**Last Name (STitle) 2323**] [**Name (STitle) 2324**] ([**Numeric Identifier 38654**]).
An infusion port catheter ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 79 year old man with a history of metastatic colon cancer with known metastases to the liver and lung, s/p recent ERCP with biliary stent placement who presented with fever and hypotension requiring initial ICU admission, found to be bacteremic on admission.
He later became hypotensive to 90s without compensatory tachycardia (of note, patient is on a beta-blocker at home).
He was given IVFs and received 1 unit PRBCs.
His blood pressures remained stable during his stay in the ICU and he did not require pressors at any time.
His beta blocker was later added back on for hypertension, but was switched from atenolol to metoprolol in the setting of renal failure.
He was started in empiric Vancomycin and Zosyn in the ICU and surveillance cultures were sent.
These antibiotics were continued on the OMED service until admission blood cultures grew out E. coli, pansensitive except to cipro.
He was switched to CTX and clindamycin (CTX for e. coli, clinda for concerns about oral infection because he was complaining of tooth pain).
He was switched to vanc/zosyn per their recs and started on nystatin for oral thrush.
He was also started on valtrex for outbreak of herpes labialis.
ANC recovered and pt was switched to ertapenem monotherapy for ease of home dosing for a total course of 14 days.
He will switch to maintenance therapy with acyclovir after a 7d course of valtrex.
Oral surgery evaluated the patient and did not feel there was infection or abscess present, and that the tooth could be extracted at the patient's convenience, per onc recs on timing.
Clinda was stopped after oral infection had been ruled out.
Etiology was uncertain but could be medication vs. pre-renal (pt appeared dry and required a lot of fluids on the floor).
Pt will require triple therapy at some point, but ID recommended pursuing this after completion of his current treatment for bacteremia.
He was given 1 unit PRBCs as above and it was felt that his anemia was most likely secondary to his recent chemotherapy.
His Hct stabilized after the transfusion and no further intervention was required.
His BP stabilized in the ICU and he became hypertensive again on the OMED floor, so he was restarted on his beta blocker, though started metoprolol instead of atenolol in the setting of renal failure.
