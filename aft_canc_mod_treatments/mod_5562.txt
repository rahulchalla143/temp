BAL: Bronchial cells and many pulmonary macrophages.
Pt was recently admitted for intractable hiccups, hyponatremia, diastolic CHF exacerbation, UTI, and PNA (d/c [**2190-12-1**]).
He was treated with compazine, IV hydration + stress dose steroids, gentle diuresis, and levo/flagyl.
His wife states that he has lost 40 lbs over the past 4 months, and has lost 10 of those lbs in the past week (though she thinks much of this is due to fluid diuresis as his peripheral [**Last Name (un) **] has improved markedly as of late).
The pt took 3 doses of compazine but has had no relief.
He was minimally responsive to 500 cc NS boluses x 2 followed by IVFs with NS @100cc/hr.
Asymptomatic AV dissociation and bradycardia s/p [**Company 1543**] Sigma 300 DR [**Last Name (STitle) 4448**] placement [**5-18**].

Cirrhosis (consistent findings on recent ultrasound, but not seen on CT abdomen [**11-24**])   Social History: The patient lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) **] Corner.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS: 96.6, 98/60, 80, 22, 97% RA Gen - thin, fatigued, somnolent but arousable, lying in bed HEENT - PEERL 3 -> 2mm bilaterally.
These may represent real lesions and correlation with ultrasound is recommended.
Also with worrisome intra-abdominal and mediastinal lymphadeopathy due to unknown cause, continually elevated alkaline phosphatase, hyponatremia, ARF.
Given concern for infection and early sepsis on admission, the pt was treated with vancomycin/aztreonam, given IV fluid resuscitation to support his BP, and transferred to the MICU.
He was taken off the stress dose steroids and the antibiotics and he remained hemodynamically stable.
- given splenic findings, heme/once was consulted, performed BM bx on [**12-17**] that was consistent with a possible myeloproliferative disorder (?CML) and not explanatory for his FTT - the interventional pulmonary service performed a BAL and TBNA on [**12-20**] that was also non-diagnostic, returning negative for malignancy cells - thoracic surgery has arranged for an outpatient appointment on [**12-28**] at which the pt and his family can learn about the risks and benefits of mediastinoscopy as the next step in attempt to get a tissue diagnosis.
- in the future, liver bx or colonoscopy might be options to evaluated primary source, given pt's h/o cirrhosis of unknown etiology and h/o colonic polyp that was not resected and not f/u.
- pt was given stress dose steroid peri-bronchoscopy and responded well - throughout his admission, he was monitored for signs of infection; his pulmonary status and abdominal exam remained stable throughout.
Did not correct despite fluid resuscitation, empiric abx therapy, and stress dose steroids.
- his antihypertensives were held throughout this admission due to hypotension - he had a foley catheter to monitor urine output, it was d/c'd on [**12-22**] - CXR [**12-15**] showed improved CHF and no PNA, CXR [**12-22**] showed some atelectasis - pt was diuresed with lasix on [**12-16**] and [**12-21**], then restarted on his po home regimen of lasix 80 mg qd and spironolactone 25mg po qd.
Will go to rehab on lasix 80 qg + spironoacltone 25 mg qd.
- As per nutrition team's recommendation, pt was given sugar-free shakes with meals to supplement po intake which should continue after discharge - his electrolytes were repleted as necessary throughout his stay: his serum calcium never increased to a normal level over the course of his stay.
Has been intermittently responsive to compazine in the past.
Pt was placed on fall precautions and had no further episodes.
- started celexa 10mg po qd [**12-18**], did not have a decrease in his serum sodium after starting SSRI - mood did not improve over the course of his stay, would recommend outpatient f/u with [**Female First Name (un) **] psych, social work, or end-of-life care if he continues to deteriorate.
- pt was given IV hydration for the first days of his admission - Cr remained stable .
# Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 - RISS was used for management until [**12-21**] - started home dose of glargine 15U qam [**12-21**] + RISS - sugars remained reasonably well-controlled throughout his stay .
- po prednisone was given on a tapered schedule as per endocrine (noted above), pt is now on home dose of 5mg po qd.
- colchicine therapy was continued while in the hospital .
- PPI was given for stress ulcer prophylaxis - Sc heparin was given for DVT prophylaxis .
He also refused medications (mainly electrolyte repletion) several times over the days he was admitted.
Pt is now d/c'd to rehab facility with outpatient follow-up with thoracic surgery to discuss risks/benefits of mediastinoscopy.
