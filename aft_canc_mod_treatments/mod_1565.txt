After his last admission, he was started on a prednisone taper and continues to be on prednisone 15mg once daily.
He lives in an [**Hospital3 **] facility in [**Location (un) **] and has been receiving chemotherapy as an out patient.
The pt reports he normally is able to walk [**4-2**] steps prior to developing SOB even with oxygen however in recent days he does not believe he can do even that.
He received tylenol for the fever and it has since resolved.
The pt was placed on 4L NC with saturation in the mid 90s, however he was desaturating to the 80s with movement.
He was therefore started on NRB in the ED.
CVP was initially measured between [**9-8**], and after fluid resuscitation was found to be 20.
He was given cefepime and vancomycin for presumed febrile neutropenia as well as dexamethasone 10mg IV x1 as he is chronically on prednisone.
In addition, the pt received 2unit of PRBC for Hct of 23.7 and 3L of NS and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
Past Medical History: Oncology History: Mr. [**Known lastname 21781**] was initially found to have multiple polyps on routine colonoscopy in [**2182-11-28**].
After much discussion, a medical regimen consisting of Nevelbine wsa initiated as his significant COPD and other co-morbidities precluded a surgical approach.
He is now on cycle two of Nevelbine which he has tolerated well as an outpt.
Presumed primary lung CA metastatic to colon on Navelbine 2.
CAD: ETT-MIBI [**1-27**] w/ moderate partially reversible inferior defect, no c/o angina, med management -echo ([**9-30**]): EF 60%, no WMA, could not assess PASP 4.
Treated with heparin and coumadin.

for aflutter, LAD, RSR' in V1-V4, no ST changes, poor R wave progression   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: This is an 80 year old gentleman with lung cancer metastatic to colon undergoing Navelbine chemotherapy, severe COPD on home oxygen undergoing taper who was admitted with sepsis to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and found to be neutropenic with Klebsiella bacteremia.
In [**Name (NI) 153**], pt had transient pressor requirement along with IVF support for hypotension which resolved by HD 2.
Stress dose steroids were started.
He was generally afebrile through course in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and did not require intubation By the end of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay once he was breathing with adequate saturation on 2L.
He was continued on empiric vancomycin, cefepime, and received one dose of gentamicin.
Blood cultures from admission grew 2 out 4 bottles with final culture being Klebsiella sensitive to cefepime, resistant to levofloxacin and gentamcin.
Vancomycin was discontinued, cefepime was maintained Per Dr. [**Name (NI) 3274**], pt received GM-CSF for his neutropenia.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course also remarkable for intermittent atrial flutter seen on telemetry and supratherapeutic INR for which coumadin was held.
His neutropenia was noted to resolve s/p GM-CSF treatment.
Surveillance blood cultures taken on the His respiratory status was still not at baseline and therefore the pt was steroid regimen was made more potent by changing the steroid to solumedrol.
Given his ongoing need to complete his IV antibiotic course, severe COPD, metastatic lung cancer, ongoing chemotherapy and his home situation (he lives alone), it was believed, with agreement from the physical therapy service, that he would benefit from transfer to an extended care facility.
He was treated with IV cefepime for his infection and high dose steroids for his COPD.
He is to continue 5 more days of antibiotics for his infection and a prednisone taper for his COPD exacerbation.
He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further coordination of his chemotherapy for his metastatic lung cancer.
Certainly he was more susceptible to infection given his chemotherapy-related neutropenia (he was 2 weeks out from last treatment, hence he was at the nadir) His hemodynamic status appears to have returned to nl.
-- continue IV cefepime for 5 days --surveillance blood from [**12-17**] and [**12-18**] are negative thus far.
oxygen supplementation, he is back at baseline O2 requirement -albuterol nebs and tiatropium (replaces ipratropium) atrovent nebs only as needed, --continue prednisone taper (see discharge plan).
Neutropenia, resolved s/p GM-CSF treatment -appears to be improving, continue to monitor CBC and ANC.
Metastatic lung cancer, on Navelbine treatment, will have to defer further cycles for now, will coordinate with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to determine timing of further treatment.
History of DVT: on coumadin was held for supratherapeutic INR.
Atrial flutter/atypical rhythm: -Asymptomatic  7.
Type II Diabetes: continue insulin with [**Hospital1 **] NPH with SS.
Although this may be difficult to control with addition of higher dose of steroids, will attempt control with sub Q insulin.
Depression: Have changed psychatric regimen, had some signs of depression and and hallucinations this admission, resolved when we restarted pt on trazodone and venlafaxine.
