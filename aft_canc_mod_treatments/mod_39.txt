Final recommendations for duration of antituberculosis regimen will be given at a later date by Infectious Disease Service.
Tuberculosis was confirmed by PCR, gene probe.
The patient did have an episode of somnolence when supplemental oxygen was turned up secondary to carbon dioxide retention.
Somnolence resolved with supplemental oxygen being decreased.

Digoxin, Lasix and Metoprolol were started.
Lisinopril was also restarted.
There was mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation and again this could not rule out marantic endocarditis though echogenic density is noted on aortic cusps and were consistent with degenerative changes.
It is the recommendation of the Medicine Staff to restart Coumadin at 5 mg approximately two days after discharge at the rehabilitation hospital and then to follow INRs every day until therapeutic range is met.
Heme - Coumadin was held secondary to supertherapeutic INR.

Asymptomatic hypercalcemia was noted, because of the low setting of albumin 2.4.
During hospital stay her potassium rose to 5.5 secondary to increased dosage of ACE inhibitor, subsequently Lisinopril was decreased to 5 mg at which time her potassium normalized.
Liver function tests after tuberculosis medications were started were within normal limits.
The hyperclcemia was likely due to granulomatous disease (TB) and improved with treatment of the TB.
