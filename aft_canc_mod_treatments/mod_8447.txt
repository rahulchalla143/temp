Urine culture; yeast   Brief Hospital Course: 45 year old woman with history of seizure disorder (complex partial seizures and occasional GTC) who was transferred from CHB after a seizure cluster (30 mins) in setting of 38.9C, WBC of 20K.
On trasfer, she was intubated and her LP and CT head were reportedly negative.
Patient was loaded with Dilantin at CHB with subsequent level of 18.
She was admitted to Neuro ICU for further treatment and monitoring.
She was extubated and restarted on Lamictal 600mg [**Hospital1 **] (dosing reported by patient).
Dilantin was discontinued, she was temporarily bridged with ativan 1mg IV Q8H while she was not able to take PO.
It was felt that worsening of her seizure frequency was most likely due to either an infectious process, medication non-adherence or non-epileptic seizures (an event was witnessed while in ICU: report of a gaseous odor, staring for 10 seconds, bilateral arm shaking that was suppressible by examiner (total duration of 30 seconds) and no post-ictal confusion).
The patient was transferred to the floor and refused further EEG monitoring during the hospitalization because she was very angry her hair was cut at time of presentation when leads were initially placed.
[**Location (un) 535**] was [**Location (un) 653**] and she had been receiving lamictal 100 mg tabs, directed to take 5 tabs [**Hospital1 **], and given 300 tabs per month.
The last note from the patient's epileptologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2442**], reported a plan to take lamictal 900 mg daily.
She had an episode [**12-21**] in which she vomited and then became unresponsive with tonic posturing, eyes open and midline with occasional frequent blinking, and was unresponsive to noxious stimuli.
ID: Temperature at CHB of 38.9C max, WBC of 30K.
UA was contaminated and repeat UA showed mild leukocyte count with elevated RBCs, which were treated as a UTI with ceftriaxone started.
A CT abdomen/pelvis was concerning for acute pyleonephritis and she was continued on a 7-day antibiotic course for this.
PULM: Patient was extubated on HD 1 w/o complications.
GI: Patient was complaining LLQ pain x 1 week, which was attributed to pyleonepritis as above and had resolved with antibiotic treatment.
