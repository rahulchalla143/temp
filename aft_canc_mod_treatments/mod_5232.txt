At our ED, a hip CT was obtained and ortho was consulted.
She landed on her right side and was helped up by paramedics.
Past Medical History: - Pathological L ulnar fracture and Right Hip Fracture - Primary hyperparathyroidism - Hypercalcemia - Vitamin D Deficiency - Thyroid nodules - Diastolic Heart Failure - Glucose intolerance - Acute Renal Failure - Blood Loss Anemia - Anemia of Chronic Inflammation - Hyponatremia - Delirium - Gout  Social History: denies tobacco/EtOH/illicits.
Retired from job at [**Hospital1 **] Academy in [**2089**].
Right hip with decreased ROM and tenderness on external rotation.
A Foley catheter is seen within the bladder.
There is diffuse osteopenia limiting evaluation for non-displaced fractures.
64% HR max .
A single small 7 x 5 x 4 mm nodule is seen in the mid pole of the right thyroid with spongiform appearance and a well-circumscribed thin hypoechoic rim.
There is also intense tracer uptake at T12, consistent with recent fracture (as a compression deformity was seen at this level on recent chest radiograph, age indeterminate).
Intense tracer uptake at the right hip and T12, consistent with recent fractures.
A biopsy will be scheduled at a later date, as the patient's aspirin was discontinued only on [**2120-4-8**].
There is some midline sclerosis at the vertex, likely related to the site of the sagittal suture The site of the coronal suture is also vaguely visualized as an area of increased density.
Inflammation involves the muscles of the right neck including masseter, platysmus and occipital musculature, which are notably thickened.
The vascular structures of the neck including the right retromandibular vein remain patent and opacify well.
There is extensive inflammatory change throughout the right neck with transspatial involvement of the right masticator and parapharyngeal spaces.
Hemithyroidectomy pathology: 1.
>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 71F with multiple falls and fractures, with a complicated hospital course, who presented with L arm pain and now s/p L ulnar repair and R hip fx which has not been repaired, found to have primary hyperparathyroid and thyroid nodules s/p hemithyroidectomy.
Her hospital course was also complicated by paroxysmal AV block, s/p pacemaker placement, pacer site infection and pacer removal.
Calcium levels remained elevated despite IVFs, lasix prn, cinecalcet in an attempt to lower calcium levels.
She eventually underwent a hemithyroidectomy given primary hyperparathyroidism plus spongiform nodules seen on thyroid ultrasound.
FNA had been preformed prior to surgery was nondiagnostic.
She was receiving oral calcium supplement and Vitamin D.  She also received calcitriol daily.
Per endocrine, bisphosphinates should be held for at least 1 year post surgery given risk for hypothyroidism.
Vanco/unasyn was switched to augmentin with MSSA culture but patient spiked again and vanco/unasyn restarted.
The patient was also treatd with warm compresses and decadron given inflammation in retropharyngeal space.
Endocrine surgery decided to do a hemithyroidectomy rather than a parathryoid adenoma removal based on thyroid nodule.
#Paroxysmal AV block:pt s/p pacer placement.
per EP pt does not need pacer replacement.
EP placed a drain at pacer site and have been pulling it out a centimeter every day.
# L ulnar fracture and R hip fx: s/p L ulna repair (POD #0 [**2120-4-8**]).
Ortho does not plan to do R hip repair in the immediate future [**3-8**] old fracture status.
pain control with tylenol and oxycodone prn.
# HTN: held ACEI [**3-8**] renal failure.
continued beta blocker .
