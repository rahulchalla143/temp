[**2122-2-3**] Colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
History of Present Illness: 66 y/o M with hx of laryngeal CA with treatment by right hypopharyngeal excision and s/p chemo and XRT in [**2119**] presents with increasing SOB, hoarsenss and stridors.
He was treated with diflucan at that time for fungal infection.
ENT was consulted and he was taken to the OR where he had a tracheostomy with local anesthesia.
After the trach was placed he received general anesthesia through his tracheostomy.
He takes aspirin occassionally.
Does not take ibuprofen at home.
Recent EGD in [**Month (only) **] showing gastritis and duodenitis when he had his PEG tube placed.
Past Medical History: Stage III larygneal SCC s/p right hypopharyngeal excision and cisplatin/XRT [**11-30**] Fungal laryngitis s/p PEG tube HTN   Social History: Lives with brother.
FOE: nose (see above), NP no masses, eustachian tube patent bilaterally, epiglottis crisp, AE fold and arytenoids with some edema; The b/l VC are have whitish lesions on them and they are minimally mobile.
WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2122-2-2**]):       Due to mixed bacterial types (>=3) an abbreviated workup is       performed; P.aeruginosa, S.aureus and beta strep.
[**2122-1-31**] PORTABLE CXR Tracheostomy tube has been placed and its tip is 6.7 cm above the carina.
There is no evidence of PTX and some right basilar atelectatic change is visualized along with a similar-appearing opacity adjacent to the right heart border.
[**2122-2-3**] COLONOSCOPY A single sessile 10 mm polyp of benign appearance was found in the ascending colon.
A single-piece polypectomy was successfully performed using a cold snare.
[**2122-2-5**] VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: Oral and pharyngeal swallowing study was performed today in collaboration with speech and swallow pathology.
However, laryngeal elevation and laryngeal valve closure were moderately reduced.
Reduced laryngeal valve closure contributed to the patient's penetration and aspiration.
Epiglottic anatomy was edematous and deflection was reduced.
Bolus propulsion was moderately impaired with mild residue seen on the lower posterior pharyngeal wall.
IMPRESSION: Moderate pharyngeal dysphagia characterized by impaired laryngeal valve closure which resulted in penetration and trace aspiration.
For full details and treatment recommendations, please refer to the speech pathologist note from the same day.
He was taken to the OR for emergent tracheostomy, direct laryngoscopy, and esophagoscopy which revealed postradiation changes throughout the laryngopharynx, no evidence of tumor in the hypopharynx or disease on the supraglottic surfaces, fixed arytenoids with limited ability to rotate, some ulceration near the right arytenoid which was biopsied, but no clear neoplastic changes.
Culture swabs were taken of the larnyx and right arytenoid and the patient was started empirically on unasyn and fluconazole.
Unasyn was changed to augmentin on POD#2 as the patient was improving.
Cultures eventually grew oropharyngeal flora and Saccharomyces Cerevisiae.
PMV was placed on POD#4 and the tracheostomy was changed on POD#5.
#Aspriation pneumonia - As the patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable with a normal WBC#, augmentin was continued for coverage of aspiration pneumonia.
He will complete a 14-day course on [**2122-2-13**].
Flushing the PEG tube did not produce a bloody or melanotic return.
He will continue on PPI [**Hospital1 **] and will have a repeat Hct soon after discharge.
#Nutrition - Tube feeds were well-tolerated at goal rate, and eventually transitioned to bolus feeds 5 times daily.
Video oropharyngeal swallow study on [**2122-2-5**] revealed moderate pharyngeal dysphagia characterized by impaired laryngeal valve closure which resulted in penetration and trace aspiration.

You had a tracheostomy placed emergently on [**2122-1-31**].
Please continue taking the antifungal medication as prescribed through Friday, [**2-13**] to treat your vocal cord infection.
You were also diagnosed with pneumonia, most likely due to aspiration, which was partially treated with antibiotics.
Please continue taking the antibiotics as prescribed through Friday, [**2-13**].
You had another swallowing study which showed muscle weakness and a high risk for aspiration even with ground solids and nectar-thickened liquids.
It was therefore recommended that you take nothing by mouth and receive your nutrition only via tube feeds.
