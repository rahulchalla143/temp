([**Numeric Identifier 32915**]) ## CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2167-5-30**] 1:17 PM CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Reason: r/o pna [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: [**Age over 90 **] year old woman intubated for hypoxic resp failure, new CVA, RLL PNA and new fevers REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o pna INDICATION: Fever.
She remained intubated during her short ICU stay as she remained minimally responsive off sedation.
The neurologists noted a left-sided weakness on their exam and recommended a MRI/MRA scan to assess for the new stroke which was confirmed acute and embolic.
She was placed on ASA and coumadin.
Given multiple areas of infarction suspicion was for an embolic source.
For this reason coumadin was recommended and she reached an INR of 2.5.
However, ongoing hematuria limited coumadin therapy.
Eventually she needed to have the coumadin stopped and was placed on ASA only.
After further discussion with Neurology, she was placed on Aggrenox plus ASA 81mg daily.
However, hematuria continued nonetheless, requiring another unit of blood to be transfused.
Therefore, aggrenox was discontinued and she was maintained on aspirin alone for secondary prophylaxis.
She was treated with levofloxacin and metronidazole.
She was eventually weaned off the ventilator.
She completed a 10 day course of Levo, Flagyl IV and was oxygenating well on room air at time of discharge.
3) Altered mental status: The patient's mental status was attributed to a combination of infectious processes and medications, and multiple strokes.
4) UTI - treated with Levoquin  5) Nutrition - Given her poor mental status following extubation, it was not safe to even attempt a speech and swallow evaluation.
She was started on tube feeds per nutrition recommendations.
Coumadin was held for this reason.
She required occassional blood transfusion to maintain her HCT.
As mentioned above, the continued hematuria with clots necessitated the reduction of her anticoagulation to aspirin alone.
They stated that hematuria could be tolerated as long as there were no large blood clots.
The foley was therefore discontinued and the patient maintained good UOP and a stable HCT.
Although unlikely to occur, if her urine output drops off then blood clot retention should be considered.
There were no tube feed residuals and amylase and lipase were normal.
It was presumed to be due to tube irritation.
She was treated with prn morphine with good result.
