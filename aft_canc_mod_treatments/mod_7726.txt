Immunohistochemical stain for CMV was negative in parts A and C  GI Bleeding Study ([**2167-3-30**]) - IMPRESSION: Active bleeding first occurring at 67 minutes in the area overlying the pelvis between the iliac arteries, although localization to a portion of the bowel was not possible.
Multiple ulcers to varying depths, some transmural, with numerous cytomegaloviral (CMV) inclusions seen; see note.
IMPRESSION: Normal myocardial perfusion, with increased left ventricular cavity size and decreased systolic function compared to [**2165-5-21**], most compatible with a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
Incomplete evaluation of known widespread pulmonary carcinoid metastasis, due to respiratory motion and presence of effusions with compressive atelectasis.
Note is made of patent left internal mammary artery conduit to left anterior descending artery and a saphenous vein graft.
A note is made of bilateral pleural effusions, lung base atelectasis, a right upper lung nodule and a small left renal cyst- all described above.
CXR ([**2167-4-27**]) - FINDINGS: A right PICC line terminates with the tip at the cavoatrial junction.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila are normal.
Microbiology: CMV Viral Load (Final [**2167-4-14**]): 39,900 copies/ml.

Pt had only been at rehab for 1 week when he returned with multiple bloody BM's and hypotension at rehab believed to be [**1-6**] volume depletion [**1-6**] bloody diarrhea.
He was already on ciprofloxacin and flagyl from previous admission and these were continued.
His prednisone was discontinued and salumedrol started instead.
After his flexible sigmoidoscopy he had several episodes of bright red [**Month/Year (2) **] per rectum believed to be [**1-6**] oozing from biopsy sites.
Pt recieved infliximab on [**2167-3-27**] (hep serologies and ppd negative) with minimal effect.
Of note, pt had been transitioned back to prednisone from solumedrol on [**3-27**].
In the MICU pt continued to have intermittent BRBPR with coincident hct drops for which he required several more units of PRBCs.
On [**4-6**], pt went to angio and found to have an intermittently bleeding branch of the left colic artery but too tortuous for intervention thus pt taken to OR on [**4-7**] and underwent L. colectomy with colostomy with specimen sent to pathology which returned positive for CMV inclusions.
He was initially started on valgancyclovir and subsequently switched to iv ganciclovir per ID.
His CMV viral load improved and he was transitioned to PO valgancyclovir.
This will be covered by the vancomycin course that had previously been started for the patient's positive [**Month/Day (4) **] culture (see below).
# Positive [**Month/Day (4) **] Culture: On [**2167-4-23**], the patient's PICC dressing was noted to be coming off of his skin and his PICC site appeared contaminated.
The PICC tip was sent for culture.
The [**Date Range **] culture from the patient's PICC ultimately grew MRSA, and he was started on vancomycin IV.
This PICC should be pulled when his 14-day course of vancomycin is complete.
He was initiated on IV ganciclovir and had a negative opthalmology exam for retinitis.
He responded to therapy and on [**4-18**] his CMV was 1,980.
They recommended deferring treatment for tachycardia, but suggested nodal agents/antiarrhythmics once more medically stable.
Throughout his hospitalization he has been on various medications on and off for tachycardia including diltiazem, esmolol drip, standing metoprolol iv and po.
At the time of discharge, the patient's heart rate was stable on a regimen of metoprolol 25 mg tid.
# HF: Patient was intermittently treated with iv lasix though overall this had been held given the concern for bleeding and hemodynamic instability.
He was restarted on lasix 80mg daily on [**4-14**], and his repiratory status improved.
At the time of discharge, the patient was stable on his home regimen of lasix (80 mg daily).
All heparin products d/c'd on [**3-27**] for concern of HIT.
His lasix and antihypertensive medications were initially held.
[**Month/Year (2) **] pressure medications were eventually restarted.
He was continued on his cardiac medications.
His aspirin was held during his hospitalization, given his recent GI bleed.
Improved with acetazolamide administration.
Diagnosis of Crohn's Disease: Was treated with 1 dose of infliximab during his hospitalization.
Steroids had initially been increased to solumedrol but were later tapered back to prednisone.
Of note, colectomy samples did not show evidence of Crohn's.
Pt is being disharged on a prednisone taper.
Pt's hypdrocortisone enemas were discontinued given severe irritation of perineal area.
Pt was followed by wound care service.
Pt will follow-up dermatology as an outpatient for further wound care recommendations.
Appears to be primary lung rather than GI source per old imaging and prior heme/onc notes.
