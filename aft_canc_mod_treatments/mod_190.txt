Chest X-Ray ([**2148-5-24**]): PA and lateral chest compared to [**2148-5-12**]: Tip of the left PIC catheter projects over the superior cavoatrial junction.
Brief Hospital Course: 69 year old M with CLL d+8 of CEPP, s/p [**Hospital1 **] regimen and s/p recent admission for abdominal pain secondary to ileus, who is admitted for febrile neutropenia to 101F and increased dry cough.
Recurrent CLL, atelectasis, inflammatory process, as well as drug effect, were also possiblities.
CT [**5-29**] showed: progression of multiple patchy nodular opacities associated with peribronchial thickening and ground-glass opacity predominantly in centrilobular distribution, most prominent in right middle lobe, involving both upper and lower lobes, worsened compared to the prior study, most likely worsening infectious process with persistent bilateral axillary, mediastinal, abdominal, and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Bronchoscopy [**5-31**] showed PCP in BAL despite atovaquone prophylaxis, therefore pt.
started on bactrim 360mg IV q8, with premedication with compazine, anzemet and olanzapine prior to dose for h/o projectile vomitting with bactrim.
He was improving with decreasing O2 demand and tried oral bactrim [**6-6**] to see if he could complete his course at home however he had uncontrolable nausea and vomitted with aspiration and desaturation to 50% and was placed on 100% NRB and went to 98%.
He was treated with levofloxacin and flagyl for 1 week out of concern for aspiration pneumonia but he improved so rapidly that it was likely a sterile aspiration.
He was maintained on IV bactrim for 21 days, he was also maintained on solumedrol which was slowly tapered.
He ambulated with PT and was noted to desaturate to 86% on room air but came back to 91% on his own while ambulating, so will be discharged with home oxygen therapy to wear when working with PT.
He was discharged on dapsone 100mg daily for prophylaxis, with 20mg daily prednisone to be tapered by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] as an outpatient.
2 CLL: At the time of admission he was on CEPP regimen treatment.
His Cytoxan was held the day of admission.
However, the patient was continued on procarbazine per his outpatient medications.
We also continued his Prednisone 100mg q Day for 2 days to complete that part of the regimen.
Moreover, his procarbazine was discontinued after completion of his regimen due to drug effect.
He was treated with G-CSF for 6 days as ANC responded well and he was no longer neutropenic.
He had a portacath placed [**6-19**] for further therapy.
The differential included serotonin syndrome, infection, and procarbazine drug effect.
He was still lethargic, and was put on telemetry and fluids.
He was restarted on effexor out of concern for depressed mood but tapered off again as he may need procarbazine in the future.
He was started on ritalin twice daily 2.5mg at 0700 and 1300 on [**6-14**], increased to [**6-20**] to 5mg twice daily.
4 Nausea: During this hospital course nausea was a significant issue, primarily attributed to chemo and bactrim therapy.
He was evaluated by GI who felt that mechanical obstruction was not likely to be contributing and that there was no indication for endoscopy at this time.
Nausea was controlled with compazine, anzemet then zofran, zyprexa, ativa, and a three day course of emend.
On admission, his Hct was below 25 and he was given 1 unit PRBCs with a good response.
He required occaisional blood transfussions thorughout his hospital course with a hct.
# Sleep Disordered Breathing: He has a history of sleep disordered breathing and has been on Bipap in the past but had not used his machine for 9 months prior to admission but his machine was tried [**6-5**] to improve sats while sleeping with minimal improvement prior to aspiration event, but it was not continued after this event.
