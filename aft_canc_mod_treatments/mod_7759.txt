History of pulmonary embolism:  per prior notes, had evidence of EKG changes suggestive of PE as well as an echo with right ventricular hypokinesis/dilatation and a D-Dimer >[**Numeric Identifier 6085**].

He had a LGIB as a consequence of this within the month, and his anticoaguatlion was stopped and an IVC filter was placed instead.
Hematuria- The patient develop intermittent hematuria after removal of his foley catheter.
History of lower GIB and diverticulosis: currently off anticoagulation with baseline hematocrit.
Lung Cancer: Currently receiving chemotherapy on carboplatinum and taxol.
