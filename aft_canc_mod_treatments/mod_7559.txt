Admission Date:  [**2104-9-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2104-9-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2052-1-25**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**] Chief Complaint: Displaced Nephrostomy Tube, Hyponatremia   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Nephrostomy tube placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52 y/o F with a h/o stage IV appendiceal adenocarcinoma recently complicated by pseudomonal urosepsis from bilateral hydronephrosis requiring the placement of bilateral nephrostomy tubes who presents from home after one of the tubes has been displaced.
She was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2104-9-3**], at which time she was found to have pseudomonal urosepsis and was discharged on ciprofloxacin 400mg IV BID to complete a 14 day course, during that hospital stay she was also found to be hyponatremic with a sodium in the high 120's, thought to be due to SIADH.
Today when her family was helping move her from the couch her right nephrostomy tube got caught on something and was accidentally pulled out so her family brought her to the ER to have the tube replaced.
The initial plan had been to have IR replace the nephrostomy tube tonight, however when her labs returned this was put off.
She was given 10 units of IV insulin, 1 amp of D50, calcium gluconate, her scheduled dose of ciprofloxacin, along with cefepime and vancomycin for her leukocytosis.
A repeat K after treatment was 5.4 and her sodium was 116.
While in the ER it was noted that her left sided nephrostomy tube was not draining anymore either.
Also on arrival to the ICU it was noted that her left sided nephrostomy tube was not draining or flushing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Past Medical History: Stage IV appendiceal adenocarcinoma (pT3 Nx pM1b); K-Ras mutation confirmed - [**2102-11-3**]: Presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for progressive abdominal/pelvic discomfort.
- [**2102-12-12**]: Re-presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with continued lower abdominal pain as well as about a month's worth of vaginal bleeding.
- [**2103-1-17**]: CA-125 elevated at 113 - [**2103-1-23**]: Went to the operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2028**] for a planned hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and staging procedure for presumed endometrial adenocarcinoma.
The left fallopian tube and ovary were also replaced by hemorrhagic mass.
This stained positive for cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20, ER, and CDX2, confirming this as  an appendiceal primary.
The same adenocarcinoma was found to be  involving the right fallopian tube and ovary, uterus, cervix, omentum, and the serosal surface of the bowel wall (pM1b).
- [**2103-3-21**]: Began cycle 1 of FOLFOX; required 20% dose reduction of all medications after cycle 1 due to neutropenia; oxaliplatin stopped after 4 cycles due to neuropathy; completed sixth cycle  on [**2103-8-22**] - [**2104-1-5**]: Presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with small bowel obstruction,  thought to be due to intraperitoneal relapse.
- [**2-/2104**]: Underwent evaluation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12982**] at [**Hospital1 336**] for hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).
Underwent debulking of intraperitoneal carcinomatosis by HIPEC was deferred given obvious hepatic metastases.
- [**2104-5-15**]: Began cycle 1 of palliative FOLFIRI and bevacizumab;  on day 27, was admitted to the hospital with a colovaginal fistula after complaining of stool per vagina - [**2104-7-15**]: Underwent a complicated surgical takedown of the enterovaginal fistula, diverting ileostomy, and repair of a bladder perforation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Found to have diffuse enteritis with new bilateral  obstructive hydronephrosis and progression of peritoneal and hepatic metastases.

EKG: NSR at 97bpm, no peaked T-waves or PR prolongation, poor R wave progression   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 52 y/o F with a h/o stage IV appendiceal carcinoma who presented after her right nephrostomy tube had dislodged, found to be hyponatremic and hyperkalemic, with a Cr above her baseline on labs.
#) Dislodged Nephrostomy tubes: right tube was completely dislodged and the left tube no longer flushes or drains.
#) Hyponatremia: Etiology not completely clear based on her urine lytes or serum osms, likely has a component of hypovolemic hyponatremic, while on exam she appeared total body volume up, her JVD was flat and her MM dry.
Her urine lytes show a low urine sodium and high osms, consistent with hypovolemic hyponatremia, however she does not appear as sodium avid on labs as one would expect, this could be due to a degree of [**Last Name (un) **] as her Cr is up to 0.8 from her baseline of 0.2-0.3.
Further correction with IVF in the hospital setting was discussed with the patient and family, but it was decided to opt in favor of discharge home w/ hospice given current goals of care.
She was discharged with some additional bags of NS for use PRN until hospice arrives on Monday.
#) Hyperkalemia: potassium was 6.4 on admission with no EKG changes, improved to 5.4 after calcium gluconate, insulin and D50, possibly related to worsening renal function.
Continued ciprofloxacin 400mg IV bid to complete prior course for pseudomonas urosepsis, did not continue vanc/cefepime started in the ER.
#) [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr up to 0.8 from 0.2 to 0.3 as a recent baseline, given her hypovolemia on exam was likely pre-renal, however may also be partially due to an obstructive picture given dislodged urostomy tube on the right and the left is not draining.
She was given IVF and nephrostomy tubes were replaced as above.
#) Stage IV Appendiceal Carcinoma: Currently not seeking further therapy and on home hospice.
