History of Present Illness: This is a 70 year old woman with past medical history significant for COPD (0.55 FEV1/FVC 38% of predicted on home O2), status post left upper lobe endobronchial lung reduction, CAD, CHF, PVD status post multiple bypass surgeries, on chronic anticoagulation who presented with worsened dyspnea over the past 4 weeks associated with hoarseness of voice since 2 weeks.
She was also found to have a CXR which showed left lung collapse with tracheal deviation to the left, and was referred to our ED for this, where she received a combivent nebulizer prior to transfer.
In the ED, she received two combivent nebulizers and 10 mg SC vitamin K and was then transferred to the MICU.
There, she was given 60 mg prednisone but she refused this citing history of steroid induced psychosis; she is currently on a prednisone taper (20 mg a day currently).
She is on aspiration precautions for a paralyzed vocal cord and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33748**] as an outpatient.
She was started on an amiodarone drip and converted back to sinus.
Then, she had another episode the night prior to transfer and converted on IV amiodarone.
Past Medical History: 1) COPD, FEV1 0.55, FEV1/FVC 38% of predicted 2) Status post LUL endobronchial lung reduction surgery [**12/2159**] 3) CAD status post remote MI (no history of cath) 4) CHF, previous EF 35% but most recent echo in [**2160**] with EF 55%  5) Mobile mass in mitral valve, unknown etiology 6) Peripheral vascular disease s/p multiple bypass surgeries 7) Prior history of DVT's 8) History of small bowel obstruction s/p exp.
Endobronchial reduction valves, left upper lobe.
Squamous cells, inflammatory cells and bacteria .
Labs at discharge:   Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 47011**] is a 69 year old female with a history of COPD on home oxygen (4L NC), status post left upper lobe reduction, CAD, CHF, peripheral vascular disease on chronic anticoagulation who presented with dyspnea secondary to left lung collapse and associated tracheal deviation.
The patient's left lung collapse improved with stenting by IP.
According to ENT & S&S recs, we will discharge patient home on aspiration precautions with [**Hospital1 **] PPI, regular diet, medications given in purees .
At that time, her coumadin was held, and her INR improved with vitamin K. Heparin was started for bridge to coumadin prior to discharge, and transitioned to lovenox 50mg [**Hospital1 **] until her INR becomes therapeutic.
On day of discharge, INR was 1.6 today, we therefore increased coumadin to 2mg po daily today, and discharged home on lovenox 50mg SC BID (to treat embolic occlusion of left subclavian artery), while waiting for INR to become therapeutic.
#) Atrial fibrillation: Following her first episode of atrial fibrillation, the patient was loaded with amiodarone IV with conversion to normal sinus rhythm.
She reverted back to atrial fibrillation subsequently and was restarted on an amiodarone drip.
She was transitioned to PO amiodarone on [**8-21**] and will be discharged on amiodarone 400 mg po daily.
She will discharged with anticoagulation as above (lovenox bridge to coumadin, f/u with PCP for INR).
# CAD: On beta blocker, statin, ACEi.
Will continue these medications.
She was begun on prednisone for presumed COPD exacerbation, and will be discharged home with a 3 day taper (2 more days on 20mg then 3days on 10mg po qdaily).
#) Leukocytosis: This is perhaps secondary to steroids and the stress of lung collapse.
She is being treated for post-obstructive pneumonia.
Initially, she was trated with vancomycin/ceftriaxone and then transitioned to PO levo/flagyl to complete 7 day course.
WBC was 12 on day of discharge, felt [**12-31**] steroid use.
Her antibiotic course was completed on day of discharge.
#) Peripheral vascular disease - Pt was dicharged on aspirin and pentoxyfilline.
# FEN: Regular diet with thin liquids and regular solids per Speech & Swallow.
She does not object to intubation, but would not want to be kept alive on ventilator for lengthy period at the discretion of her husband (her healthcare proxy).
