On admission, she also ruled for NSTEMI with Trop=7.46, and was also noted to have ARF with elevated Cr=4, which was thought [**2-19**] hypovolemia from diuresis from elevated blood sugars.
She was started on an insulin drip with good control of blood sugars, started on plavix, aspirin, heparin, statin and beta blocker for her NSTEMI.
She was not started on an ACE I due to her ARF.
She was given stress dose steroids, as she was on prednisone as an outpatient and ?found to be adrenally insuffiecient.
She had episode of SOB on floor for which she received 40mg IV lasix with good UOP and resolution of symtpoms.
She was started on nitro gtt and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
She was therefore transferred to CCU for diuresis prior to cath.
Past Medical History: DM COPD, steroid dependent Lung CA s/p rescection (LUL lobectomy) anxiety GERD   Social History: smokes 1ppd x 40years, no EtOH, no drug use, lives with son in [**Name (NI) 1157**] per patient.

Patient was treated empirically for pna (sputum cx from [**3-27**] w/ MSSA and H.Flu) with broad spectrum abx (vanc, aztreonam) and was extubated on [**2105-3-31**].
Again, unclear etiology of her underlying pulmonary process, as no clinical evidence of volume overload or apparent cause of flash pulmonary edema, on broad spectrum abx w/ vanc, aztreonam and clindamycin, and on [**Date Range 3782**] steroid dose of pred 10mg qd for COPD.
Patient was started empirically on bactrim 200mg IV q6hr for PCP coverage, as LDH has remained high throughout hospitalization.
Patient also underwent 14 day course abx with vanc, aztreonam, also transiently on bactrim empirically for PCP (micro negative from BAL).
Patient was also continued on her home dose of prednisone 10 mg QD as well as inhalers.
Patient subsequently underwent another hypoxia induced PEA arrest (12 minutes) on [**4-13**] requirement brief dopamine infusion.
Patient was subsequently started on morphine drip for comfort as she became bradycardic and hypotensive on AM of [**2105-4-18**].
Cr then resolved to 1.2, but then had code on [**4-5**] with repeat cardiac cath (although small amount of dye was used), and Cr now trending back up.
# Cardiac: A. Ischemic:  Patient initially presented to OSH with CP, r/i for NSTEMI, started on heparin gtt, underwent dobutamine stress test and developed CP, SOB, TWI in inferior leads (II, III, avF), transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath.
She was continued on ASA, plavix, statin and amiodarone.
Initially MUCH improved lung exam on IV lasix.
Intra cath following code on [**4-5**], PCWP=16, mildly elevated L and R filling pressures.
O/n [**4-1**] pt transiently went into AFib - started amio load and gtt, and pt remains in and out of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter.
Patient went into PEA arrest while down in IR having her PICC line repositioned on [**2105-4-13**].
D. Pericardial rub:  pericardial rub appreciated on ascultation on [**3-29**] - cardiac enzymes sent that demonstrated no elevation.
EKG demonstrates diffuse ST elevation and PR depression c/w pericarditis.
She received on epo 8000 units TIW (M,W,F).
Improved once lipitor was d/c .
# DM:  Patient w/ long history of DM, apparently non-compliant w/ insulin as outpatient.
Patient FS were controlled with insulin gtt .
# ?Adrenal insufficiency:  Patient started on fludricort and hydrocort (stress dose steroids) at OSH - per notes, believed to be adrenally insufficient due to hypotension despite IVF boluses.
Plan to: - will attempt to contact [**Name (NI) 3782**] provider for more information regarding this diagnosis - on fludricort as [**Name (NI) 3782**] for orthostatic hypotension, on 10mg pred QD as [**Name (NI) 3782**], No hx of adrenal insufficiency.
Therefore, steroids as above.
# GERD:  Continue protonix .
Stable with fluid restriction .
