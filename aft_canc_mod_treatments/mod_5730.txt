The patient was started on heparin in the ED.
She was transitioned to lovenox SC and coumadin on [**12-14**].
She was transferred to the general medicine floor when stable where she continued to require 2-3L oxygen by nasal cannula.
In the setting of malignancy, pt was switched to lovenox for treatment of PE.
She was discharged to rehab due to her continued O2 requirement.
Pt very distressed and declined to make any decisions on biopsy at this time.
Pt discussed options with social work and palliative care and decided not to pursue any further work-up or treatment and prefers not to discuss results any further.
She was made aware that if she developed symptoms such as pain, she could seek symptomatic treatment at that time.
