Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Chest tube removal.
Ultrasound-guided paracentesis x2.
He was subsequently diagnosed with a Klebsiella pneumonia, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were narrowed to Cefuroxime.
An emergent chest tube and left subclavian line were placed on [**3-12**] after discovery of the pneumothorax (likely the result of CVL attempt on [**3-11**]).
Hepatitis C cirrhosis, previously on transplant list but now off due to non-compliance.

Pleural fluid ([**3-20**]): ENTEROCOCCUS SP.
Patient is status post chemoembolization in the right hepatic lobe, with evidence of tumor extension of a segment VI lesion to the diaphragmatic/peritoneal reflection.
Small left pneumothorax remains after removal of chest tube.
This was presumed due to hepatic encephalopathy from non-compliance with lactulose at home.
Upon admission, he was started on lactulose and rifaximin and started on tube feeds.
After improvement in his mental status, he was re-evaluated by speech and swallow who cleared him for soft solid diet with thin liquids.
He pulled out his feeding tube overnight, and it was felt as he was eating adequately, there was no need to replace the dobhoff tube.
He was transferred from an OSH intubated in the setting of left-sided pneumothorax.
As above, he was quickly weaned off the ventilator and extubated in the ICU.
Upon transfer to the floor, bronchodilator nebs were continued for COPD.
The left-sided chest tube (placed at outside hospital for pneumothorax) continued to drain large amounts of straw-colored fluid, and it was felt that this fluid was likely draining from his ascitic abdomen (via the diaphragm) down the path of least resistance to the pleural space.
Follow-up chest x-rays after chest tube removal showed stable bilateral pleural effusions.
Meanwhile, his respiratory status improved with diuresis and paracenteses such that at time of discharge, he is satting mid 90s on 2L.
Vancomycin Resistent Enterococcus UTI and SBP.
Initially, while the urine and pleural fluid cultures were still pending sensitivities, he was kept on ceftriaxone for UTI and presumptive SBP.
When the culture data returned, he was started on Daptomycin.
A PICC line was placed so that he can complete a 14 day course on [**4-6**].
His mental status improved markedly on the combination of lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy and Daptomycin for VRE UTI and SBP.
He underwent ultrasound-guided paracenteses x2 for total of 4.5 L fluid removal.
He was restarted on Lasix and spironolactone for prevention of fluid reaccumulation.
These should be continued for treatment of ascites and lower extremity swelling.
In addition, he should be kept on a low sodium diet.
For pain related to his ascites, we have been treating with morphine 15 mg twice daily.
We felt the symptoms were consistent with TMJ dysfunction, and treated with low dose Flexeril as needed.
