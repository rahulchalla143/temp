He did take all meds as usual.
He denies angina since arrival at the hospital after he was given morphine, asp, nitro, lasix 20 IV, metoprolol 5mg x2.
He also takes coumadin for his hypercoag state.
Coronary artery disease, status post non-Q-wave myocardial infarctions in [**Month (only) 958**], [**Month (only) 547**], and [**2190-6-30**].
In [**2190-2-28**] the patient had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and PTCRA of the left anterior descending artery and first diagonal.
Then in [**2190-6-30**] the patient had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the first diagonal, and then in [**2190-8-30**] the patient had a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to the posterior descending artery on [**2190-9-3**], and then was taken back to the catheterization laboratory for recurrent chest pain on [**9-6**] and had percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to the first diagonal which had a 90% lesion.
The patient also has gastric ulcers.
He also has a "watermelon stomach."
Hypercoagulable stable, status post splenic infarct, multiple pulmonary emboli, cerebrovascular accident and portal vein thrombosis.
Right groin hematoma, status post cardiac catheterization.
No change since prior CT dated [**2194-5-21**] [**2194-5-22**] CXR - No significant interval change over the last 24 hours, the patient with marked congestion, probably pulmonary edema and possible overlying infectious processes [**2194-5-21**] CT Head - Severely limited exam, secondary to patient motion.
Plan: 1. chest pain--presented to OSH with his anginal equivalent, pain resolved there with asa/morphine/ntg/metoprolol.
Concern for ACS - probable angina/demand ischemia, exacerbated by his anemia/bleeding, & CHF exacerbation.
- follow serial EKGs, monitor for any recurrence of angina - cycle enzymes, telemetry - continue aspirin, low-dose metoprolol (monitor closely on BB as this could mask GI bleed), stating (increase to high-dose statin); no anticoagulation given GIB -cardiology planning to follow up  2. guiac positive stool + Hct drop--serial Hcts - pt with known varices, ulcers, & watermelon stomach for which he has had argon treatments.
Concern for any of these etiologies; however, given his NSTEMI & CHF, would not do EGD at this time, and instead manage medically.
- transfuse to hct>30s; lasix prn w/ transfusion - serial hct Q6hrs; IV ppi [**Hospital1 **]; 2 large bore IVs - gently correct coagulopathy - got vitamin K in ED, hold coumadin - would not reverse INR given his hypercoagulable state; this was discussed with GI, hem/omc, & cardiology -no NG lavage done d/t known varices and elevated INR - GI following; plan for EGD when medically stable  3.
CHF - pt with probable CHF, on lasix as outpt.
Clinically in decompensated CHF - likely due to medication non-complicance and dietary indiscretions on his recent vacation.
- gently diurese with IV lasix - low-dose metoprolol for ACS - hold ace given his GIB - plan for repeat echo here  4.
WBC 103K with immature cells on smear - pt with known CML, on hydrea as outpt.
- obtain records, & ensure his WBC count is at baseline - make certain smear consistent with priors (r/o blast crisis); heme-onc to review smear - continue hydrea as per home regimen - case was discussed with heme/onc team, who concurred with continuing current hydrea dose, & will review peripheral smear.
ARF atop CKD - unknown baseline -check urine lytes, resuscitate as needed  6. hypercoagulability - pt w/ recurrent VTE, also h/o CVA; on coumadin as outpt.
6. hypothyroidism - cont synthroid  The patient continued to deteriorate while in the ICU.
Several attempts to wean the patient off the vent were unsuccessful.
The family decided to discontinue support and the patient was made CMO.
Medications on Admission: ALLERGIES: The patient denies any drug allergies but states he has had some arm itching at sites of MORPHINE INJECTION.
