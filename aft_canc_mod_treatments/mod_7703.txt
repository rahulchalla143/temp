He was started on tigecycline (to cover for MRSA, GNR, anaerobes) and he had a CT of the abdomen with contrast, which showed a smaller spleen compared to 2 weeks ago from 19cm x 14cm to 13.9cm x 10.7cm.
Patient was directly admitted to medicine for further management of pleural effusion, splenic infarction/necrosis, pain and dyspnea.
He recieved a total of 2mg IV dilaudid (0.5mg followed by 1.5mg) .
Thoracic surgery was also consulted to place a large bore chest tube, which the will do the morning of [**2117-12-23**].
- s/p laryngectomy and radiation for laryngeal carcinoma - chronic pain syndrome [**1-26**] larynx cancer - seizure disorder - hypothyroidism - ICA stenosis - erectile dysfunction - coronary calcification - nephrolithiasis   Social History: Former roofer, now on disability.

CV: tachycardic, regular rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Thorax: lipoma on right side, inferior to scapula.
Inspiratory and expiratory rales and wheeze from tracheostomy site.
Dullness to precussion on right side throughout.
Interval placement of left chest tube which crosses the diaphragm and has its pigtail within the splenic fluid collection.
Additional pigtail drainage catheter in the splenic fluid collection placed on [**2118-12-23**] by CT guidance.
No change in loculated left pleural effusion with multiple small loculations with catheter in place.
Unchanged size of splenic fluid collection with two catheters in place.
New chest tube drain with subcutaneous axillary emphysema secondary to the chest tube placement.
[**2119-1-3**] CXR : Interval removal of chest tube with no pneumothorax visualized.
LACTOBACILLUS SPECIES.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 yo male with pleural and splenic collections, s/p thoracotomy, multiple tube thoracostomies, infected with Lactobacillus.
In the setting of HCV, pancreatitis c/b splenic vein thrombosis leading to gastric varices s/p splenic artery embolization.
# Large left sided pleural effusion with tracheal deviation: as seen on CXR done at [**Hospital3 **] (LGH) and at [**Hospital1 18**], the patient has large left sided pleural effusion, increasing despite 1.5L tap [**2118-12-21**] at LGH.
He was started on vancomycin and Zosyn for empiric coverage given likely infectious nature of effusion.
Interventional pulmonology placed a chest tube on [**12-24**] and drained approximately 2L of fluid from pleural space (fluid had pH 6.78, and was exudative in nature based on Light's criteria, PMNs on gram stain, culture pending).
Interventional radiology then placed a catheter in the splenic fluid collection with drainage of approximately 300cc of serosanguinous fluid.
Thoracic surgery was consulted, and thinks the splenic fluid is likely from an abscess as opposed to sterile collection.
At time of transfer to floor his chest tube was in place and draining sanguinous fluid, splenic catheter was also in place draining serosanguinous fluid.
On the floor a second chest tube thoracostomy was performed, however it was complicated by placement into the intraperitoneal cavity.
Initially the decision was made to leave the tube in place since it may be entangled with the IR guided drain.
Additionally the following day the pleural fluid collected with a chest tube placed here throughout lactobacillus as well.
On [**12-28**] the patient was taken to the Operating Room and underwent a left thoracotomy with decortication.
He tolerated the procedure well and had stable hemodynamics post op.
His pain was controlled initially with an epidural catheter and his chest tube drainage was minimal.
The tube was removed on [**2119-1-3**] and his chest xray showed a markedly decreased effusion.
# SIRS/Sepsis: patient presented with leukocytosis, tachycardia, tachypnea.
His tachycardia temperatures soon normalized with a treatment of the chest tubes and antibiotics.
Vancomycin was discontinued after speciation pathogen.
The course of treatment will depend on the splenic fluid collection and the length of time the splenic drain will be in place.
he has a PICC line in place for antibiotic therapy.
During his hospital course platelets were trended stably throughout hospital course.
No alterations to his medications were made.
He was started initially on Dilaudid PCA then transitioned to PO pain medication.
After multiple adjustments with the assistance of the Pain service he is doing well on MSO4 30 mg [**Hospital1 **] with Dilaudid 4  mg every 3-4 hours for breakthru pain.
He's also on a Clonidine patch.
His pain is less since his chest tube was removed and he has remained afebrile.
Due to his multiple medical problems and lengthy hospitalization, rehab was recommended prior to returning home to help increase his endurance.
He will remain on antibiotics indefinitely for now and will be followed closely by the Infectious Disease service and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

After multiple drains were placed you currently have only one left which is draining a collection around the spleen.
You will be on antibiotics possibly until tht drain is removed but that will be determined by the general surgeon and the infectious disease doctors.
