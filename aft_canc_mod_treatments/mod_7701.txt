Still has a headache [**4-14**] and received IV morphne at OSH.
ON INITIAL TRANSFER TO INTERNAL MEDICINE SERVICE 70 year old man with known HTN/hyperlipidemia, essential thrombocytosis on Anagrelide (phospholipase A2 inhibitor - platelet reducing [**Doctor Last Name 360**]), who presented on [**2112-11-11**] with headache and nausea and vomiting, ad was found to have bilateral Sub-dural hematomas, left greater than right, with some rightward shift of midline structures by approximately 5mm, for which he underwent R burr hole evacuation and L mini craniotomy and evacuation, membrane lysis, adhesiolysis.
He has also been started on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
However, subsequently developed increasing agitation and delirium and required Haldol and transient restraints.
MEDICINE INTERVAL COURSE FROM MICU This is a 70 year old man with essential thrombocytosis, now s/p bilateral craniotomy/burr holes for SDH on [**11-13**] who developed hypoxia, tachycardia, HTN on the floor and found to have severe bilateral pulmonary infiltrates concerning for aspiration vs pulmonary hemorrhage.
Duing his ICU stay, the patient was placed on Labetalol contiuous drip overnight 0.5 mg/hr overnight then stopped at 8am and transitioned to PO Labetalol, and uptitrated to 200 [**Hospital1 **].
He was given Lasix diuresis (40 IV at MN and 20 IV at 3a) and is net 2L negative.
Per MICU nurse, he was noted to desat to 90% on RA but improved back to mid-high 90% on 3L NC.
MEDICINE INTERVAL EVENTS ON TRANSFER FROM CARDIOLOGY The patient was transferred back from the Cardiology service after stabilization of persistent SVT's, despite multiple nodal agents and 200 TID Amiodarone.
He responded to an increased Amiodarone dose to 400 TID with plan to continue at this dose for a week then decrease to 400 daily until f/u with Elelectrophysology team after discharge.
He was also continued Labetalol 200 [**Hospital1 **] and added Metoprololol 25 qid, continued Lisinopril as well.
Telemetry shows normal sinus rhythm with alarms for occasional frequent ectopy and bigeminy/trigeminy as before but overall much less ectopy and runs of SVT's.
Hematologically, his platelets continue to rise and per H/O recs he was started on ASA 325 after confirmation by NeuroSurgey that this was resonable from their perspective.
His Anagrelide was also increased to 1g [**Hospital1 **].
He is also on subQ Heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
Oxygenation has not been any furhter issue.

[**11-14**] CT Head- IMPRESSION: Status post burr hole and craniotomy for bilateral subdural hemorrhage evacuation, with decreased degree of pneumocephalus and extent of the hemorrhages.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 year old man with known essential thrombocytosis on Anagrelide,and hypetension,  who presented with bilateral subdural hematomas from trauma, ad was treated with  bilateral craniotomies and burr holes.
He reaur several transitions f care from services including internal medicine, the mdical and surgical ICUs, as wellas the cardiology service, overte core of his admission  He was [**Hospital 90988**] transferred to Internal Medicine at the end of a two-week hospitalization.
On [**11-13**] he was taken to the operating room and underwent a right sided mini craniotomy and left sided burr holes for evacuation of the SDH's.
Pt was started on Dilantin with normal levels through admission and discharged on 150 TID to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**5-11**] wks with repeat head CT at that time.
SIRS criteria and hypoxia: While on the neurosurgial service, the pt developed increased agitation and required restraints and haldol administration.
CTA was performed but did not show evidence of PE; it did show bilateral ground glass opacities concerning for aspiration vs pulmonary hemorrhage, given his essential thrombocytosis and increased predilection for bleeding.
His hypoxia rapidly improved with HTN/tachycardia control and IV diuresis such that he was weaned to minimal O2 requirements.
He was briefly treated with Vanc/Zosyn but this was quickly weaned off for over 1 week before discharge.
We o not feelthat he had a pulmonary infection, given his subsequent course.
Persistently elevated WBC count was thought to be due to hematologic process as he was ~14 on admission, rose to high teens, but back down to ~14 on d/c.
Of note, the patient's CXR's were initially called as more consistent with aspiration, then later called as pulmonary edema; by this time he had been diuresed and dramatically improved to minimal supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.
Cardiology had been consulted and pt started on slow Amiodarone load and uptitration of nodal agents; he persisted through this and was getting more hypotense to low 100's, so was transferred to Cardiology service where he was more aggressively loaded with Amiodarone 400 tid for a total of one week, with plan to decrease to 400 daily thereafter.
He was also started on both Metoprolol and Labetalol.
Because of starting Amiodarone, pt was switched from Simvastatin to Atorvastatin.
We suspected tha very close monitoing of his cardiac status would be needed, given his complex cardiac regimen, and therefore spoke with his referring providers and provided extensive discussion with the patient and family regarding warning signs and follow-up suggestions.
Regarding HTN: Lisinopril was increased to 40 mg daily, and dual beta blockers as above.
The pt and his family were repeatedly instructed on him being on 3 blood pressure and rate medications and that as his underlying intracranial process resolves, to be careful for bradycardia, hypotension, and what to look out for.
This medication regimen should be addressed in scheduled follow up visits.

Afterwards, you had low oxygen levels; tests showed that you did not have a pulmonary embolus, but there were abnormalities in your lungs that could have been due to aspiration (stomach contents inhaled into your lungs), or blood loss into your lungs, but the latter was felt to be less likely.
Your high blood pressure could have also contributed to some fluid buildup into your lungs, for which you were given a medication to remove fluid.
Finally, you were given medications to slow down your heart rate and will need to continue them until Cardiology follow up, at which point you should discuss whether or not to continue them.
Your platelet count rose because you were off Anagrelide for awhile but this was restarted as appropriate.
The following changes were made to your medication regimen: 1.
START Amiodarone: this medication was started to keep your heart rate down.
STOP Simvastatin: this medication can interact with Amiodarone and was changed to Atorvastatin instead 3.
START Atorvastatin 20 mg daily: this will take the place of Simvastatin at a lower side effect rate 4.
START Labetalol 200 mg twice a day - this is for blood pressure and heart rate.
START Metoprolol 25 mg four times a day - this is for blood pressure and heart rate.
START Phenytoin (Dilantin) 150 mg three times a day until your Neurosurgery follow up, this is to prevent seizures 9.
START Iron (ferrous sulfate) 325 mg daily to help with your iron stores 10.
START Docusate, Senna, and Polyethylene Glycol (Miralax) as needed to prevent constipation from Iron pills 11.
INCREASE Aspirin to 325 mg daily  As we extensively discussed, [**Male First Name (un) **] is on three blood pressure and heart rate lowering agents because we had such a difficult time controlling both.
As his condition improves, he may need this medications lowered or stopped.
I have spoken to your Hematologist [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 45462**] and your primary care [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 39527**] [**Last Name (Titles) 51969**] and given them verbal signout on your admission.
