However, patient decompensated during the procedure and only one tumor was successfully ablated.
Per OMR note in liver tumor board, patient does have residual tumor (2.6 x 1.7 cm) and was considered a non-candidate for further procedures.
He was treated conservatively with blood products and antibiotics for SBP prophylaxis.

Three lesions in the segment VIII of the liver at the dome, the largest one measuring 2.5 cm and arterial enhancing with washout at delayed phase.
Liver transplant evaluation initiated as patient was listed for potential organ.
He was transferred to the floor shortly but required further intensive care support.
His hospital course can be summarized by the following review of systems:  Neuro: Patient with worsening encephalopathy despite lactulose and rifaximin.
Pulm: With worsening mental status, he was intubated on [**7-10**] for airway support.
His oxygen saturation continue to decline despite ventilator support.
Patient did require vasopressor support to maintain blood pressures.
The differential for the acute change  acute worsening is broad and included recent sepsis with perhaps persistent SBP (got 5D ceftaz, flagyl at OSH), other infection(PNA or UTI), alcoholic hepatitis (although pt and wife state no ETOH since [**3-7**]) and gastro-intestinal bleed.
On the evening of admission the combination of the patient's, acute worsening liver disease and renal failure, he was started on octreotide, midodrine and 50mg of albumin and lactulose.
He was continued on lactulose and octreotide until the time of his transfer.
This required serial monitoring of coag labs and near daily transfusions of FFP, cryoprecipitate, and platelets with goals of INR<4, Fibrinogen >100, Plt>50.
On [**7-5**] a dobhoff was placed for [**Street Address(1) 65886**] recs and tube feeds started.
The following morning he was taken to surgery for an aborted transplant operation.
The tube was replaced upon his return to the floor and tube feeds were re-initiated.
These findings coupled with his pre-existing 2.5cm HCC still feel within the [**Location (un) **] criteria for transplantation.
Patient resumed on supportive care but due to worsening overall condition, family discussions with medical services concluded in withdrawing all care.
The patient was given albumin on admission and received a fluid challenge on [**6-29**] and [**6-30**].
Mr. [**Known lastname 3728**] creatinine trended down and was 1.6 at the time of transfer making hepatorenal syndrome less likely as he responded favorably to a fluid challenge and auto-diuresed.
Diuresis was initiated with IV lasix and spironolactone given his fluid status (see below) but the following morning his Cr had nearly doubled to 1.5.  given fluid overload we restarted his diuretics.
Over the next several days his Cr was monitored and when below 1.0 he was given 10mg IV lasix doses in an effort to remove the large amount of fluid he was retaining secondary to his multiple transfusions.
However, due to labile blood pressures, diuresis was attempted but unsuccessful due to pressor need.
#Anasarca: Likely [**1-30**] large volumes of IVF and blood products given in the MICU.
This is consistent with the large volumes of blood products he's been getting.
To improve nutritional status, enteral feeding was initiated per nutritional recommendations.
The patient was transfused 4 units of FFP before a central line was placed and 1 additional unit of FFP, 2 units of PRBC and platelets were transfused overnight.
Vitamin K, Nadolol, IV protonix and IV cipro were started and additional units of PRBC, FFP and cryoglobulin were given.
A CT of the patients torso was performed on [**6-28**] and ruled out evidence of lower GI bleeding.
IV cipro and protonix were changed to PO medications on [**6-30**] as the patient was started on a soft diet and transferred to the floor.
The patient received intermittent transfusions.
Criteria were as follows - fibrinogen > 100, platelets >50, Hct>25.
His final amount of transfusions were 18 units of pRBC, 36 units of FFP, 8 units of platelets, and 23 units of cryoprecipitate.
ID: Patient maintained on cipro initially for SBP prophylaxis.
He was then switched to vancomycin, zosyn, and micafungin for presumed sepsis.
Infectious disease consulted for antibiotic approval and recommendations.
This was after discussion with social workers, hepatology and surgical services.
