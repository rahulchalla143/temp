DIAGNOSIS: Skin and subcutaneous tissue, right leg (A-P):  1.Skin and subcutaneous tissue with fibrosis, acute and chronic inflammation, focal necrosis, focal calcification, and foreign body giant cell reaction consistent with prior procedure / treatment effect.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2116-5-15**] 4:45 PM FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study, there has been placement of an endotracheal tube with its tip at the clavicular level, approximately 6.2 cm above the carina.
There has been interval placement of a right IJ catheter that extends to lower portion of the SVC.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 M with CHF, afib, WPW s/p ablation, high grade right LE sarcoma s/p XRT and multiple excisions, hemochromatosis c/b cirrhosis, hypertension, left atrial thrombus seen on TEE in [**2111**], who was admitted [**5-7**] after elective debridement and split thickness skin graft reconstruction of radiated sarcoma defect.
Immediately post-op, his course was complicated by severe pain for which he had a sciatic nerve catheter placed by the acute pain service and atrial fibrillation with RVR.
After several liters of fluid and better pain control, his rates returned to the low 100s with metoprolol 100 [**Hospital1 **] (double home dose).
He was taken back to the OR on [**5-11**] for a large skin graft and flap surgery.
Post-operatively, he was in afib to the 160s, hypotensive, started on a diltiazem gtt and neo gtt and transferred to the TSICU.
He was also agitated and received haldol and ativan, with improvement in his mental status.
In the TSICU, he remained on a neo and dilt gtt, both weaned off on the AM of [**5-13**].
He was then rate controlled on 40 q8 PO dilt and 25 [**Hospital1 **] metoprolol tartrate.
He has been on heparin gtt for anticoagulation while his coumadin is being held.
On [**5-15**], he continued to have afib with RVR into the 140s, with a Hct drop to 19 and a developing flank/bacl hematoma.
He remained in afib to 140s, metoprolol doubled to 50 TID, dilt dc'ed, started on verapamil 80 TID.
On [**5-16**], hcts stable and rates better controlled with pressures in 110s-120s.
Heparin gtt was discontinued after bleed, placed on aspirin and heparin subQ.
He was transferred to medicine for optimaztion of rate control and anticoagulation.
On the medicine service the pt was placed on PO Diltiazem and Metoprolol succinate was continued.
Digoxin was initiated and within 24hrs his HR was well controlled with resting rates in the 70s-90s from 120s-150s prior to Digoxin.
He will be continued on just 81mg of Aspirin daily.
