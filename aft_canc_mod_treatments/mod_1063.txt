A right lung tumor was found on workup and was biopsied.
He was anticoagulated with heparin and subsequently had a massive gastrointestinal bleed which sent him to the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient received 5 units of packed red blood cells while in the Intensive Care Unit.
An inferior vena cava filter was placed and the patient was stabilized and transferred to the floor.
At this time his nutrition suffered severely due to requirement of NPO for many of the days of this hospitalization.
A gastrostomy tube was placed and initially did not function.
The patient was put on total parenteral nutrition for two weeks at which point his follow up turned around.
At this point he experienced a deep vein thrombosis in his left leg which was treated conservatively with Ace wraps.
During this hospitalization the patient was treated with Haldol and Ativan and the patient's daughter [**Name (NI) **] describes the patient "[**Last Name (un) 34693**]" severely sensitively to these medications.

The patient also subsequently received two Rituxan treatment.
The patient was started on Trazodone and Risperdal which calmed him down.
He was treated with Pamidronate.
There he had the Haldol and Ativan and again demonstrated a sensitivity to those medications.
He was tried on a Decadron treatment by Oncology to lower his calcium but this greatly worsened his mental status.
In [**2105-8-10**], the patient was transferred to [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital where he was diagnosed with multi-infarct dementia.

The patient was treated with Lasix and intravenous fluids, Pamidronate and Calcitonin.
The patient was treated with repeat of Pamidronate.
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he received 2 units of packed red blood cells.
After discussing the situation with the patient's oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30442**], it was determined that colonoscopy would not be useful, as colonoscopy had been done in a prior episode and no source of bleed was found.
If the patient bleeds again, the team plans a tagged red blood cell scan with IR embolization since the bleed is believed to be in the jejunum.
As suspected, the patient received two units of packed red blood cells during his hospitalization.
TIBC was 177, Vitamin B12 1676, Folate 15.1, ferritin 766, PRF 136.
Change in mental status - The patient has been treated with Remeron, Seroquel and Trazodone.
Narcotics and Ativan confuse him.
Deep vein thrombosis - The patient was not prophylaxed for deep vein thrombosis secondary to his history of bleed.
Gastrojejunostomy tube - When the patient was admitted he had a Foley catheter in place of a prior gastrostomy tube.
The tube was replaced by IR but nursing was unable to flush the tube, therefore it was replaced again.
At the time of this dictation the patient is tolerating 70 cc/hr of FS Ultracal feeds which provide 1.4 liters of free water.
Nevertheless, the patient's family would like to pursue full treatment of NHL and any other medical problems up to the point that he would require heroic measures.
