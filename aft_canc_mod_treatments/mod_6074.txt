Records were provided to his Atrius oncologist with plan for further staging and plan for chemotherapy.

MICROBIOLOGY DATA: [**2115-10-31**] Blood culture - no growth [**2115-10-31**] MRSA screen - negative [**2115-10-31**] Blood culture - no growth [**2115-10-31**] Urine culture - Enterococcus, sensitive to Vancomycin .
[**2115-10-28**] MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAS - Small acute infarct in the left precentral gyrus.
Early appearance of agitated saline bubbles in the left atrium/ventricle with the patient performing the Valsalva maneuver.
Left PICC line remains in place.
[**2115-11-6**] 09:37PM BLOOD Lactate-1.5  Brief Hospital Course: 75M with a PMH significant for recently diagnosed metastataic esophageal carcinoma, HTN, hypothyroidism who presented with acute respiratory failure found to have left ischemic stroke with incidental pulmonary embolus undergoing heparinization complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring MICU transfer due to presumed aspiration PNA .
It was noted that even if he obtained a feeding tube and underwent rehabilitation, his clinical status would likely not be optimal to pursue systemic chemotherapy or radiation.
In the transition to hospice, the patient's pain was controlled with liquid/PO Dilaudid, and Lorazepam liquid PO for anxiety regarding his condition.
Aspiration of pooled contents with nectar thick and thin liquids was noted.
This event occurred on the medicine floor and required MICU transfer given acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring supplementation oxygenation without intubation.
He was treated with 8-days of Vancomycin and Zosyn for aspiration pneumonia coverage.
He was also given IV Lasix given evidence of volume overload, to which he responded well with increased urine output.
He completed his 8-days of antibiotics prior to discharge.
# ENTEROCOCCUS UTI - The patient was without symptoms of dysuria or urinary frequency or urgency but given concern for sepsis in the setting of an underlying malignancy, his urine studies revealed an Enterococcus UTI, which was treated with 7-days of IV Vancomycin.
A Foley catheter was also maintained given his history of hypotonic bladder.
He completed antibiotics prior to discharge.
# NUTRITIONAL CONCERNS - Speech and swallow performed a video swallow evaluation showing recurrent aspiration attributed to history of throat radiation from prior H&N malignancy.
He was initially started on TPN supplementation with thin liquids only; however, once hospice was initiated, we allowed him to engage in regular PO intake as tolerated with minimal IV fluid support.
A feeding tube (G- or J-tube was not deemed safe given his clinical status; he was unfit for surgery).
He was heparinized with a continuous infusion until discharge to hospice.
He will go home with Hospice with twice daily Lovenox injections.
He was therefore anticoagulated with a continuous heparin infusion for both the pulmonary embolus, but also his ischemic stroke issues.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM - He was continued on Synthroid 75 mcg IV dosing given his NPO status (home dose Levothyroxine 150 mg PO daily).
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA - We continued his home dose of Simvastatin 40 mg PO daily.
Twice daily Lovenox injections for management of his pulmonary embolus and ischemic stroke issues 2.
