HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62 year old white male with an extensive past medical history significant for coronary artery disease requiring coronary artery bypass graft, history of inferior myocardial infarction, status post St. Jude valve for mitral valve prolapse in [**2169**], AICD for ventricular tachycardia, CHF with EF of 25%, history of CVA, history of ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic renal insufficiency, occluded left RA, peripheral vascular disease, history of recent lower GI bleed.
Lower GI bleed occurred in [**2172-10-8**] when during colonoscopy it was found that he had a cecal arteriovenous malformation.
He was given two units of FFP and then was given a bowel prep with GoLYTELY.
Chest pain resolved with two sublingual nitroglycerin and IV metoprolol.
It did not resolve initially with two sublingual nitroglycerin.
He received 81 mg of aspirin and 5 mg of IV metoprolol.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post inferior MI in [**2147**], status post coronary artery bypass graft times two in [**2169**].
CABG involved LIMA to LAD and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery.
Mitral valve replacement with St. Jude valve in [**2169**].
Ventricular tachycardia status post dual chamber AICD in [**2167**] for ventricular tachycardia and bradycardia.
Status post appendectomy in [**2120**].
ALLERGIES:  ACE inhibitor which causes angioedema.
Codeine and shellfish which cause hives.
Contrast dye and iodine to which he also has reactions.

b.i.d., carvedilol 0.125 mg p.o.

b.i.d., multivitamin, Norvasc 2.5 mg q.d., Imdur 30 mg p.o.
which had been discontinued because of headache, Aldactone 25 mg p.o.
He required furosemide between each unit.
Because of his anemic situation, his antihypertensives were held.
Because of the setting of his acute GI bleed, aspirin was held.
At that time nitroglycerin drip was started.
He also received metoprolol IV, morphine and aspirin.
Because of his cardiac issues, he was continued on nitroglycerin drip along with metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o.
He was also started on hydralazine 50 mg p.o.
Heparin was then started.
However, after he had hematochezia associated with chest pain, heparin was also discontinued.
Hydralazine was continued and increased eventually to 75 mg p.o.
Thereafter he was started on heparin and aspirin.
Metoprolol was increased to 25 mg p.o.
Because he had been placed on carvedilol as an outpatient, he was then switched over to carvedilol 12.5 mg p.o.
He was also started on amlodipine and Imdur.
Imdur was started at 30 mg p.o.
Norvasc was started at 10 mg p.o.
He was continued on heparin for his mitral valve replacement.
They felt that the risk of bleeding would be low after having intervention so subsequently he was started on Coumadin 5 mg p.o.
He will need to be continued on Coumadin with a goal INR of 2 to 3.
Heparin will be continued until his INR is therapeutic.
During the procedure he was found to have a single large angiectasia that was not bleeding in the cecum.
BICAP electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully.
Anticoagulation was held for 24 hours after the procedure.
Thereafter heparin was started.
However, he has been receiving large quantities of furosemide.
Magnesium and potassium were repleted as necessary.
Physical therapy has seen him and recommended rehab for him.
