Hypotension: Patient's initial ED SBP of 80s-90s resolved s/p aggressive IVFs and lactate levels decreased.
Systemic mastocytosis: The patient's acute episode was stabilized with the help of the allergy team's recommendations which included IV Solumedrol, Cromolyn and IV Benadryl.
Once patient stabilized IV Solumedrol 125 mg IV q12h was discontinued and prior home regimen of oral Prednisone 50mg was started.
Daily Benadryl and Cromolyn were continued and patient supplemented with additional hydralazine prn.
The patient will restart home meds of Singulair, Zyrtec, Gastrocrom, and Doxepin on discharge home.
After acute attack controlled the patient was consistently >95% on low flow O2 via NC and then RA.
She was given Ativan PRN orders and Solumedrol switched to lower Prednisone 50mg dose.
Patient appears well-perfused and hemodynamically stable despite her anemia history and dilutional drop in Hgb/Hct values s/p aggressive IVF resuscitation.
Continued IV PPI q12h.
Initially the patient was double covered with H2B and PPIs due to aspiration risks as per GI advice but was later switched to [**Hospital1 **] PPIs alongside Phenergen and Zofran antiemetics.
