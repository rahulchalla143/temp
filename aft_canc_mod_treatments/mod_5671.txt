The patient had CABG and sternectomy for osteomyelitis.
It still has a long extent long contiguity with pericardium but there is no pericardial effusion or other fluid collection in the mediastinum.
Heterotopic bone formation around the sternal excision margins is stable.
The patient is status post sternectomy with flap repair.
Two large fistulae tracks are identified within the anterior chest wall at the sternectomy defect.
PICC line placement [**2169-6-21**]: PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 379**] [**Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12166**].
5 cc of 1% lidocaine were applied for local anesthesia.
A 0.018 guide wire was advanced through the needle under fluoroscopic guidance with the tip in the superior vena cava.
After inner dilator was removed, a double-lumen PICC line was placed over the wire under fluoroscopic guidance with the tip in the superior vena cava.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 46-cm, double-lumen PICC line through left basilic vein with the tip in the superior vena cava.
Brief Hospital Course: Briefly, this is a 76 yo with poorly differentiated lung carcinoma (likely small cell) on etoposide and carboplatin, recurrent sternal wound osteo/infection with MRSA requiring debridements and flaps, s/p CABG in [**2166**], CAD s/p MI and CABG, DMII, HTN, COPD who presented after being discharged from [**Hospital1 15454**] rehab the day prior to admission with fever and mental status changes.
