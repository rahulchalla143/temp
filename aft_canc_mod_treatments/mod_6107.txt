[**2139-7-13**] BARIUM SWALLOW  IMPRESSION: Moderate esophageal dysmotility, with no evidence of  diverticulum, webs or strictures.
Brief Hospital Course: 64yoF with newly diagnosed L renal cell carcinoma, just started on Sutent, who was admitted with hematuria/urinary retention, LUQ abdominal pain, and through admission found to be febrile with AFib and RVR likely due to UTI.
Hematuria: Thought to be either from newly started Sutent (~30% incidence) vs known tumor invasion into collecting system on CT vs worsening of renal cell carcinoma (of note, pt also with tumor invasion into L renal vein).
She was having issues with urinary retention at home and on admission, and so had a Foley placed intermittently through admission, which was stopped by discharge as she was seen to urinate without difficulty.
Sutent was held initially but restarted by discharge and she was dischaged on Sutent, and not having any hematuria by discharge.
She was called out of MICU in stable condition and had no further unstable events, although she did have occasional RVR which was treated with nodal agents as below.
AFib with RVR: S/p ablation in the past.
In the ICU she was continued on her home Verapamil course but was noted to have some pauses which required down titration of her home dosage.
After call out from MICU, her nodal [**Doctor Last Name 360**] required uptitration and by discharge she was sent home on her home dose of 240 mg ER.
IMPORTANTLY though, she was stopped on her home Coumadin dosage due to a supratherapeutic INR which peaked to 5.0 and hematuria.
The risks/benefits were discussed with the family, and she was kept OFF Coumadin by discharge, given she was still on Sutent.
Chest pain: Cardiac enzyme negative x2 and without worrisome EKG changes to suggest cardiac etiology.
By discharge she was satting well on RA at rest and ambulating and appeared more euvolemic.
