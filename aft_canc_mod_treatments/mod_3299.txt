Admission [**Date range (1) 73061**] was for evaluation for bilateral erythema/blisters on arms after injections/ treatment with IM vidaza for his MDS on [**9-20**].

He required intubation for respiratory distress and cardioversion for atrial fibrillation.
ER visits [**10-12**] and [**10-13**]: Presented with concern of infected wound dehisence, evalutated by surgery, discharged with bactrim and keflex for presumed wound infection and concomittant UTI.
He was continued on daptomycin and pip-tazo.
He underwent U/S-guided paracentesis w/ removal of 2700cc.
Prelim biopsy for hip and peri-incisional biopsies read as neutrophilic dermatosis (pyoderma gangrenosum), though cannout rule out infectious process.

Consider paracentesis with culture.
Post operative changes rel;ated to recent bowel resection without evidence of bower obstruction or perforation.
Paracentesis:  Technically successful diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis yielding 2.7 liters of amber clear ascitic fluid, which was sent for microbiology and cell count.
Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, appear simple.
Unremarkable appearance of the large and small bowel, status post right hemicolectomy, with end ileostomy and mucous fistula in the right abdomen.
Pathology: R buttock skin biopsy: Superficial and deep perivascular, periappendageal and interstitial dermatitis with prominent neutrophils and overlying papillary dermal edema, epidermal hyperplasia, and spongiosis.
The depth of the infiltrate and lack of a more florid neutrophilic infiltrate are unusual for Sweet's syndrome, however, a variety of neutrophilic inflammatory patterns may be observed in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and in association with G-CSF (if clinically applicable).
The inflammation is peri-eccrine in areas and focally there are neutrophils involving eccrine units.

Brief Hospital Course: 67 y/o male with MDS s/p R. hemicolectomy with end ileostomy/mucous fistula on [**2134-9-28**], who presented with fluid responsive hypotension and fever.
He did not require vasoactive medication.
Possible etiologies included uperinfection of right thigh lesion with neutrophilic dermatosis, post-operative wound infection with wound dehiscence.
He was started on daptomycin and zosyn, later stopped zosyn due to low platelets, switched to ciprofloxacin and flagyl, then finally broadened to meropenum.
Discharged from MICU on daptomycin (6 total days given in MICU) and meropenum (2 days given in MICU).
ID followed the patient throughout his hospital course, and eventually recommended d/c his antibiotics after his new diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome.
He was supported with pRBC's and platelets.
- He will need Bactrim, and Acyclovir for PPX due to his low WBC.
Based upon the biopsy in addition to his clinical findings, a diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome was proposed to explain his high grade fevers in addition to his skin lesions.
Corticosteroid treatment was not initiated until multiple imaging studies confirmed that there was no infectious process or abscess in his abdomen after his recent surgery.
Multiple cultures, both urine and blood, were negative.
Based upon his clinical symptomology, he was treated empirically for Sweet's syndrome with methylprednisone 1 mg/kg with a slow week taper to 0.5 mg/kg.
He was then started on oral prednisone 50 mg/day.
He was also started on GI prophylaxis with famotidine, Vit D, and calcium.
A non-contrast CT of the lungs demonstrated improvement of his multi-focal opacities, his skin lesions continue to heal, and he has been afebrile since the initiation of steroids.
- Please continue prednisone 50 mg/day.
His steroid course will be determined by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
- Please continue Ca/Vit D and Famotidine for steroid prophylaxis - Please continue PO dilaudid for Pain, may wean as patient tolerates .
# End ileostomy/mucous fistula s/p hemicolectomy: He presented with wound dehisence.
He was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics with minimal improvement in his wound healing.
- Please continue daily wound care as outlined in attached notes - Scheduled for follow up as outlined above .
He was placed on fluid restriction and subsequently allowed to autodiuresis.
- No fluid restriction .
# Hyperglycemia: His sugars have been monitor QID, and he has been placed on an ISS with lantus to help regulate his blood glucose levels.
Patient received ear drops which were ineffective.
# Ascites: He had a paracentesis on [**2134-10-14**] with removal of 2.7L of fluid which did not demonstrate any infection.
He had an additional paracentesis which did not reveal SBP.
- Continue wound managment .
His amiodarone was discontinued.
