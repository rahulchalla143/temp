On the medical floor, she continued to improve, eventually weaned to room air, was working in Physical Therapy and actually walked 50 feet on [**3-13**], and plans were to get her to rehabilitation on the 23rd and have a PEG placed for nutrition.
However, on the [**3-13**], she acutely desaturated on the floor, initially saturating high 90s on two liters nasal cannula and dropped to the low 70s.
She was thus placed on a nonrebreather mask at 100% and then was saturating 97% on a 75% shovel mask.
The patient received multiple nebulizer treatments and chest physiotherapy with no change in her respiratory status on the floor.
The patient also received 10 mg of intravenous Lasix.
