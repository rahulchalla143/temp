HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old male with a history of renal cell carcinoma, status post bilateral nephrectomies, on hemodialysis with metastatic disease to the lung, eye, penis, also with coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction and a three vessel coronary artery bypass graft, status post AICD pacer for V-fib arrest and congestive heart failure with an EF of 30%, diabetes, hypertension, history of upper gastrointestinal bleed who was in his usual state of health until yesterday at hemodialysis when his blood pressures were noted to the in the 60's but resolved reportedly.
He got intravenous fluids and his blood pressure increased to 62/palp.
His O2 saturations were 91% on room air, therefore, he was placed on four liters.
Was transferred to the Emergency Room with blood pressures in the 60's, heart rate 93, began Vancomycin 1 gram times one and Ceftriaxone 1 gram intravenous times one, got two liters of normal saline and began a Dopamine drip.
Then subsequently Levophed drip which increased his MAPS to 65 but he was tachycardiac to 110 and only alert and oriented times 1-1/2.
Renal cell carcinoma, status post bilateral nephrectomies - the right one in [**2164**] and the left in [**2153**].
Status post [**Last Name (LF) 16859**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]-2, Thalidomide with metastases to the lung, status post a left lower lobe resection in [**2165-5-29**], metastases to the right orbit status post [**Year (4 digits) 16859**] in [**2165**], metastases to the penis status post penectomy in [**2158**] with recurrent metastases to the lung.
Status post myocardial infarction in [**2164-11-29**], status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2165-3-29**].
SVG to left anterior descending, SVG to Patent ductus arteriosus, SVG to diagonal, status post VF arrest with a AICD placement.
Stage I colon cancer status post left hemi-colectomy in [**2165-9-29**].
ALLERGIES:  Sulfa causes gastrointestinal upset, Intravenous contrast causes question of rash, also question of allergies to Venofere and Iodine.
Glyburide 2.5 mg q day.
Aspirin 81 mg q day.
Coreg .125 mg twice a day.
Plavix 7.5 mg p.o.
Mag Oxide 400 mg twice a day.
Protonix 40 mg q day.
Megace 40 mg q day.
Colace 200 mg q day.
Lipitor 20 mg q day.
Ativan 0.25 mg q h.s.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the MICU and was hypotensive requiring pressors and placed on Dopamine and Levophed which increased blood pressures.
He was initially maxed out on two pressors but then was titrated only to one, Levophed with blood pressures in the 80's to 90's.
Minimally responsive to fluid and blood and placed on stress dose of steroids.
So it was decided to perhaps to have a bedside echo done to rule out tamponade as he did have upper extremity edema with lower extremity edema and this echo showed a right ventricular mass/tumor, 35% EF with wall motion abnormalities.
It was decided that we would pre-medicate him for this supposed allergy to intravenous contrast and go ahead with getting a head CT to rule out a bleed or metastatic disease as well as we were interested in looking at the test in order to rule out inferior vena cava syndrome.
He did have his upper extremity edema and when we tried to place a central line into the right IJ the tip ended up being diverted into the right subclavian and it was questioned whether he had elevated pressures or blockage or clot in the SVC.
The family was in agreement that he would be unable to recover from the progression of his cancer and a Morphine drip was started in order to ease his pain.
