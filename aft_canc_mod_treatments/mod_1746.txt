The left brachial artery was exposed by surgical technique and coronary arteriography was performed from the left brachial artery.
The aortic valve was then crossed with a 0.014 straight wire and a pigtail catheter was placed in the left ventricle for simultaneous pressure recordings.
A 0.035 Amplatz SuperStiff guidewire was placed in the left ventricle and a single balloon inflation was performed using a 18 mm Tyshak II balloon.
