Diffuse involvement of the left hemithorax by lung carcinoma as described on recent CT chest.
PROCEDURE:  Informed consent was obtained from the patient after explaining the risks, indications, and alternative management.
Risks explained included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or permanent with possible treatment with stent or coils if needed.
The patient was brought to the interventional neuroradiology suite and placed on the biplane table in supine position.
access to the right common femoral artery was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle under local anesthesia using 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic precautions.
Over the wire, a 5 French vascular sheath was placed and connected to a saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units and 500 cc of saline) with a continuous drip.
Through the sheath, a 4 French Berenstein catheter was introduced and connected to a continuous saline infusion (with heparin mixture equalling 1000 units of heparin and 1000 cc of saline).
The following vessels were selectively catheterized and arteriograms were performed from these locations.
Right T7 intercostal artery.
Right T5 intercostal artery.
Interventional procedure was performed at this point, with five 2 x 3 mm Vortx pushable coils deployed distally into the proximal right T5 intercostal artery.
Right common femoral artery angiogram was performed through the sheath after procedure was performed, which demonstrated widely patent right common femoral artery.
The procedure was uneventful and the patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.
IMPRESSION:  Embolization of right T5 intercostal artery utilizing 2 x 3 mm Vertx pushable coils for embolization of metastatic disease to the vertebral body.
CXR [**2130-6-21**] In comparison with the study of [**6-20**], thoracic fusion procedure has been performed with metallic devices in place and skin sutures in position.
The precise position of the endotracheal tube is somewhat difficult to see, though it appears to be about 4 cm above the carina.
Patient is status post corpectomy and laminectomy with metal implants in the T1-T8 region.
Neighboring ground-glass opacities could be seen with an inflammatory reaction; although infection is difficult to exclude, organizing pneumonia after chemotherapy is fairly common.
Post-corporectomy and laminectomy from T1 through T8, across a destructive soft tissue mass centered about T3 through T5, with likely abutment against the cord, better visualized on a recent CT T-spine examination.
He was admitted to the neurosurgical floor with a plan for surgical resection of the lesion with surgical fixation.
On [**6-20**] the patient underwent embolization of the T4 tumor to reduce blood loss during surgical fixation.
A hemovac was left in place.
He received a unit of blood intra-op.
Nutrition was consulted and TPN was commenced.
The patient was started on a dilaudid PCA and then switched to morphine given concerns for hallucinations.
The patient was fitted for a post-surgical brace and made progress with physical therapy.
Pain service recommeded adding a basal rate for morphine overnight to improve overnight pain control.
Pain management increased his Fentanyl to his home dose of 100mcg.
He was given aspirin and metoprolol and a cardiology consult was placed.
On [**6-29**] he was started on Tube feeds per nutrition's recommendations.
He was started on PO pain medication and his fentanyl patch was increased.
He was still not tolerating his tube feeds so he was started on reglan and TPN was again continued.
He changed to a higher concentration of tube feeds.
He remained neurologically stable and his staples were removed without incident.
He was initially thought to be tolerating his tube feeds at the new goal, but in the afternoon he had high residuals (thick consistency & fowl smelling).
On [**7-2**] the patient tolerated his TF's as they were raised to goal.

You should wear your brace when out of bed or when your head of bed is above 30 degrees.
Take your pain medication as instructed; you may find it best if taken in the morning when you wake-up for morning stiffness, and before bed for sleeping discomfort.
Pain medication should be used as needed when you have pain.
Do not take any anti-inflammatory medications such as Motrin, Advil, Aspirin, and Ibuprofen etc.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as pain medicine (narcotics) can cause constipation.
We recommend taking an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) while taking narcotic pain medication.
