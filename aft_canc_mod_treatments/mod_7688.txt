Discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2162-8-6**] after treatment for acute on chronic diastolic heart failure exacerbation.
She received IV lasix with improvement of her symptoms.
Additionally, has not been taking BP meds as prescribed.
Due to symptoms, called 911, in ambulance noted to be tachypnic to 40's, hypoxic - placed on biPap and recieved SL: NTG for SBP 180's with improvement in symptoms.
On exam, afebrile, HR 180-100, pressure in 140's, RR 20's on BiPAP with bilateral basilar crackles, JVD, pedal edema.
Stopped nitro gtt since > than goal 20% reduction.
She lives with one of her grandsons and her daughter is involved in her care.
CXR ([**8-13**]): A pigtail catheter is seen near the left lung base with the tip towards the left cardiophrenic angle.
# Dyspnea - Patient's dyspnea was thought to be multifactorial but was consistent with flash pulmonary edema/acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure.
The patient was initially started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for possibility of pneumonia, but she remained afebrile and exhibited no signs of infection, so antibiotics were discontinued.
Aggressive diuresis was pursued in the ICU.
She was maintained on beta-blocker and [**Last Name (un) **].
Interventional pulmonary performed a thoracentesis and pigtail catheter placement and drained approximately 1 L of fluid, most suggestive of transudate BUT pleural fluid CYTOLOGY is still PENDING.
After drainage, her oxygen requirement decreased to 1L NC and the pigtail catheter has been removed.
# COPD: Patient was placed on standing nebs and her home ADVAIR was continued.
She had intermittent episodes of anxiety and was started on oral morphiine solution.
Her home meds were resumed at half the dose with plans to taper up as tolerated.
She was maintained on metoprolol 50mg po BID and Irbesartan 150mg qDay, half her home doses.
Currently, after aggressive diuresis she is running SBPs in the 100-110 range, and occasionally to the 90s so this will also have to be titrated at the [**Hospital 1501**] rehab.
She is not a candidate for treatment (XRT/chemo)due to her multiple co-morbidities.
Agressive bowel regimen was started and her iron supplements were discontinued.
# GERD- She was continued on home omeprazole.
# Hyperlipidemia- She was continued on her rosuvastatin.
She will need: -daily weights -daily physician or NP/PA review of her clinical status and medication regimen -monitoring of her renal function in the setting of diuresis -availability of chest X-Ray for evaluation of decreasing sats - DDX includes pulmonary edema, re-development of pleural effusion (lower likelyhood if she is maintained on the "dry" side as she is now), PNA.
-If her Hct drops (currently 25%), we would be very cautious about blood transfusion given her heart failure.

No recent changes have been made to her anti-hypertensive regimen, but should be considered if her BP continues to run low.
Given her severe systolic heart failure, we would be very cautious about transfusing blood products due to concern about heart failure exacerbation.
She needs to remain on DVT prophylaxis given her lung cancer, heart failure, and relative [**Name (NI) 90257**].
