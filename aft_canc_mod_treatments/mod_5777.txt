He does have a history of peripheral vascular disease with a lower extremity percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and bilateral claudication; however, the patient denied any orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, asthma, or diabetes.
Based on his evidence of new onset angina, he underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed 80% left circumflex disease, 40% left anterior descending osteal lesion, and a mid 50% left anterior descending lesion, 80% left main disease with a normal ejection fraction of 50%.
Based on these results, the patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for cardiac surgery and coronary artery bypass grafting.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Thus the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times two on [**2180-9-27**].
He received a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending and a saphenous vein graft to the diagonal.
Interoperatively a mediastinal lymph node was also biopsied for suspicious appearance.
The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
He was extubated overnight and received one unit of packed red blood cells for a low hematocrit.
His blood pressure was noted to be on the high side, so his Lopressor medications were slowly increased, finally reaching a maximum of 100 mg po bid.
He was noted to be ambulating at approximately level III, still requiring assistance and thus is awaiting rehabilitation placement in order to be discharged.
