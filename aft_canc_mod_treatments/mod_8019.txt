He began treatment [**4-24**] with oxaliplatin and Xeloda 1500 mg b.i.d.
for two out of three weeks and Avastin 15 mg/kg every three weeks.
He took Immodium as directed without relief, then changed to lomotil He continues to have frequent episodes of diarrhea.

#Diarrhea - etiology includes c.diff (recent course of augmentin for elevated wbc), infectious diarrhea, malabsorptive diarrhea, chemo related.
The patient was started on flagyl empirically for c. diff.
He was also started on octreotide/cholestyramine for a question of malabsorptive/chemo related diarrhea that was resistant to immodium.
His diarrhea improved with these interventions.
His lactate on admission was 10.7 and did not improve despite aggressive IVF hydration.
He was started on IVFs with bicarb for his bicarb of 13 and shortness of breath associated with the acidosis.
He was continued on IVFs and treated empirically with vanco, levo, flagyl.
His lactate was stable with these interventions.
His blood pressures remained stable with IVF hydration for the first 12 hours.
It then transiently decreased to 80/40 but responded to 1 L NS bolus.
Blood cultures were sent and he was started on empiric broad spectrum antibiotics.
Vanco/Levo was started for a question of SBE in the setting of a new holosystolic murmur and flagyl was started for a question of c. diff.
