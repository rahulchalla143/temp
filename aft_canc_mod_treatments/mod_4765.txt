Chest radiograph ([**5-23**]): RUL infiltration with air bronchograms consistent with PNA.
On [**2174-5-19**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a total vaginal hysterectomy, [**Last Name (un) **] vault suspension, left salpingo-oopherectomy and cystoscopy for Stage IB Endometrial Cancer and uterine prolapse.
Per cardiology recommendations, cath/stent placement was unlikely to improve Ms. [**Known lastname 67214**] pre-operative risk.
Her home dose of metoprolol, lasix, and statin were initially continued, while plavix was held and changed to aspirin 81mg.
She was subsequently cleared for surgery and general anesthesia by cardiology and anesthesia.
While NPO, she was given IV metoprolol and hydralazine and was transitioned to PO metoprolol as she started tolerating a regular diet.
Patient was started on vancomycin and zosyn, which was re-dosed to Vancomycin 1g every 24 hours and Zosyn 2.25 every 6 hours after a rising creatinine level was noted.
She received a 10 day course of vancomycin and zosyn.
After brief placement on an oxygen face mask, volume correction, and continuation of antibiotics, she was transfered back to the Gyn Oncology service two days later.
On transfer, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was maintaining good oxygen saturations on nasal canula and was slowly weaned to room air.
She was made NPO and all medications were given IV including the addition of zofran and reglan to manage her nausea/vomiting.
As her ileus and symtpoms persisted for over 6 days post operatively, a PICC line was placed and she was started on peripheral parenteral nutrition.
She was transitioned to [**Hospital1 **] intravenous dosing of a proton pump inhibitor and then to a drip, with resumption of [**Hospital1 **] intravenous dosing on post operative day#2.
A foley catheter remained in place to monitor her urine output closely which was removed on post-operative day#14.
Her prophylactic heparin was temporarily held for evaluation of this possible GI bleed but was resumed on post op day 2.
On post-op day 16 a slight drop in her Hct was noted from 25->24 and medicine recommended f/u CBC at her nursing care facility.
Per the GI consult and Internal medicine consult service, her anemia is likely related to fluctuating fluid shifts although a small [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Last Name (un) **] tear cannot be ruled out.
Post-operatively, blood sugars were difficult to control in the setting of an ileus and NPO status.
Dosages of NPH and humalog SS were adjusted on a daily basis to maintain a blood sugar goal of 120-150 while NPO and were appropriately adjusted when she started tolerating a diet.
She was continued on her home dose of levothyroxine,and briefly received it intravenously while NPO with resumption of oral medication after resuming a diet.
Her creatinine trended down upon completion of antibiotics and better intake of PO fluids.
She was repleted with D5W maintenance for 16 hours and boluses as needed.
She was placed on an Atmos Air support mattress with frequent repositioning, dressing changes every 3 days per wound nurse recommendations for management of candidiasis, chronic venous stasis, and a buttock wound.
Given her multiple co-morbidities, she will undergo surveillance and no further interventions will be required.
Prophylactic management included subcutaneous Heparin (temporarily held during evaluation of possible upper GI bleed), TEDs, and ambulation with physical therapy.
