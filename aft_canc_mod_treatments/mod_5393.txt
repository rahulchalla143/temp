Admission Date: [**2114-2-26**]        Discharge Date: [**2114-3-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2076-4-12**]        Sex:  F  Service:  OME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 66801**] is a 37-year- old female with metastatic melanoma admitted to begin cycle 2, week 2, high-dose IL-2 therapy.
In [**2113-1-18**], a right groin mass was noted with FNA confirming melanoma.
She underwent right inguinal lymph node dissection in [**2113-3-20**] with 1 lymph node replaced with melanoma and evidence of extracapsular extension.
She completed right groin radiation therapy in [**2113-5-20**] and began interferon in [**2113-6-20**], discontinued in [**2113-9-20**] when a breast mass biopsy confirmed melanoma.
She underwent radiation therapy to the lumbar spine in [**2113-9-20**].
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  [**Doctor Last Name **] syndrome, right hip injury, status post tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, status post right __________ in [**2113-4-20**], status post [**Last Name (un) **] eye surgery.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Celexa 20 mg daily, multivitamin 1 tablet daily, Ativan 0.5 mg at bedtime p.r.n.
She is status post right inguinal lymph node dissection with radiation changes.
ADMISSION LABS:  WBC 6.9, hemoglobin 9.3, hematocrit 28.8, platelet count 483,000, INR 1, BUN 17, creatinine 0.6, sodium 139, potassium 4.5, chloride 106, CO2 of 28, glucose 88, ALT 11, AST 10, LDH 183, CK 24, alk phos 92, total bilirubin 0.5, albumin 3.6, calcium 8.5, phosphorus 3.4, magnesium 2.2.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 66801**] was admitted and she underwent interventional radiology placement of a central line to begin therapy.
Her admission weight was 58 kg and she received interleukin II 600,000 international units per kilogram equaling 34.8 million units IV q.8h.
However, at 08:15 a.m. after her third dose of IL-2, her systolic blood pressure was noted to be 50 at which point she was placed on dopamine with titration upward to a maximum of 6 mcg per kilogram per minute.
Initially her blood pressure stabilized in the 80s, but she became more hypotensive over the next several hours requiring the addition of Neo-Synephrine with dosage titrated upwards to 3 mcg per kilogram per minute with systolic blood pressure still in the 70s.
Blood cultures were drawn and broad spectrum antibiotic coverage was initiated with vancomycin and cefepime.
Since she was reaching maximum pressor dosing on the floor, she was transferred to the ICU for further hypotension management.
With volume repletion, her dopamine was weaned and her Neo-Synephrine was weaned over the next 24 hours.
She was transferred back to 7 [**Doctor Last Name **], 24 hours later and Neo-Synephrine was weaned to off.
Her blood cultures revealed no growth and her vancomycin and cefepime were discontinued.
She was continued on Keflex for line prophylaxis.
Given her profound shock and hypotension after 3 doses of IL- 2 attributed to capillary leak syndrome, we opted not to rechallenge her with interleukin-2 during this week.
Other side effects noted this week included nausea and vomiting improved with antiemetic therapy.
She was anemic and transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells during this admission.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Metastatic melanoma status post cycle 2, week 2, high-dose IL-2 complicated by shock and hypotension related to IL-2 capillary leak.
Lasix 20 mg p.o.
Benadryl 25-50 mg q.6h.
Zantac 150 mg p.o.
Citalopram 20 mg p.o.
Eucerin cream topically.
Compazine 10 mg q.6h.
Keflex 500 mg p.o.
