[**2138-9-24**] PORTABLE CXR:The ET tube tip is 4.3 cm above the carina.

Brief Hospital Course: In summary, the patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of Hodgkins Lymphoma diagnosed in [**2127**] who was recently diagnosed with mesothelioma in [**2138-5-18**] after confirmatory biopsy at [**Hospital1 112**] /[**Company 2860**].
He presented to [**Hospital1 18**] as a transfer from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3075**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3549**] Hospital where he presented shortly after 2am on [**2138-9-20**] with tachypnea and multiple episodes of SVT terminating with vagal maneuvers and IV adenosine.
He was sedated with propofol and intubated, and cardioverted x2 succesfully.
He was then started on procainamide drip overnight.
An EP procedure with possible ablation was discussed but it was felt that this was a high risk in the setting of his commorbidities.
Procainamide was discontinued and Amiodorone PO was started for better control of Mr. [**Known lastname **] SVT with the understanding that it would not be used as a long term medicine in the setting of underlying pulmonary disease.
Metoprolol was discontinued given risks for bradycardia and hypotension while on Amiodorone.
The tachycardia terminated  after carotid massage and no additional anti-arrhythmics were needed.
After this event the team decided to  uptitrate Amiodarone for better control and on [**2138-9-27**] the team decided to continue his dose at 200mg [**Hospital1 **] x 1 week and then he would decrease to 200mg daily dose.
In general   the patient's SVT was well controlled on Amiodarone at the time of discharge home and he was set up for an EP follow-up visit at [**Hospital1 18**] for continued management of his arrhythmias.
He broke this rhythym on his own after approx 3 minutes.
CARDIAC PUMP FUNCTION: In regards to Mr. [**Known lastname **] cardiac pump function he had serial echocardiograms during his hospital stay which revealed a normal EF in the 55-60% range despite some evidence of pulmonary volume overload.
RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Initially a pulmonary embolism was ruled out with CTA after admission given the patient's baseline sinus tachycardia and tachypnea.
During an acute episode of SVT on [**2138-9-21**], hospital day 2 in the CCU, the patient's HR reached 260-270 range and after failed vagal maneuvers and 2 rounds of Adenosine IV the patient was cardioverted to attain NSR again.
Prior to cardioversion, anesthesia was called and the patient was sedated and given Propofol and Midazolam prior to intubation for airway protection and comfort as the patient was extremely anxious and respirations were in the 30s.
Given patient's known sensitivity to benzodiazepines and in light of ABG he was given Flumazenil 0.2 mg IV for over-sedation concerns.
The patient responded well and ABG trends improved and respiration rate climbed to appropriate range with ventilation assistance.
He remained intubated for several days on assist control mode and then pressure support with very low doses of Propofol for comfort and light sedation.
The patient's cyclobenzaprine and ativan doses were held and tubefeeds were supplemented for nutrition.
The patient had excellent urine output and self-diuresis s/p extubation and did not require any additional Lasix.
He complained of a mild sore throat after extubation which abated in 2 days and he was given additional Cepacol throat lozenges for added relief.
It was felt that a bipap titration could be performed, allowing him to be discharged to home with bipap at night and during the day while at rest.
PNEUMONIA: The patient's above respiratory distress was felt to be multi-factorial with contributing underlying poor lung reserve at baseline given his mesothelioma alongside a newly recognized LLL pneumonia on CT and CXR as well as his extreme anxiety and tendency toward tachypnea.
The pulmonary team was called to comment on the patient's CTA and CXR findings as compared with [**Company 2860**] reports which were obtained for baseline comparison.
He was therefore started on IV Vancomycin, Zosyn and Azithromycin for extended atypical bacterial coverage.
A right sided PICC line was placed for IV antibiotic therapy.
Further workup included sputum gram stain and culture, PCP smear, fungal culture , urine legionella antigen,and blood cultures.
Of note, the oncology team felt that the patient's lung CT changes and decompensated respiratory status requiring intubation and cardiac ectopy was unlikely secondary to any drug/chemotherapy regimen.
ANXIETY: The patient was initially managed with low dose Ativan and his home Celexa regimen but after he had benzodiazepine related somnolence and impaired respirations requiring extubation his Ativan was held.
SUPERFICIAL PHLEBITIS: The patient had an erythematous inflammation on his right forearm at the site of a prior IV placement.
He was given warm compresses for some added relief.
The patient's antibiotic regimen for his PNA was deemed as adequate coverage for his UTI as well.
Clinically, he denied suprapubic pain, urgency, dysuria or hematuria.
During intubation his nutrition was supplemented with tubefeeds via OGT.
He was ultimately placed on a standing daily magnesium supplement.
Goal potassium was >4 to avoid any additional pro-arrhythmic effects.
These electrolyte abnormalities were attributed to the patient's underlying malnutrition secondary to his advanced cancer and chemotherapy as well as some loose stool he experienced towards the end of his hospital stay.
TRANSFER OF CARE: It became clear that the initial plan of controlling his SVT and discharging him to home for further outpatient management was not possible with his continued hypercarbia.
