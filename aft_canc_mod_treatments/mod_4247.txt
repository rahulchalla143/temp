She received Lopressor 5 IV and began loading po amiodarone for 24hrs but the patient did not convert.
Electrical cardioversion with sedation was performed on [**10-7**].
She was put on a heparin drip, Amiodarone 400mg po tid, Metoprolol 12.5mg po bid.
After the cardioversion the patient continued to be monitored on tele and did not re-convert to atrial flutter.
She was transitioned to coumadin and got her first dose in the hospital and was instructed to follow up with her PCP for an INR check in 4 days.
She was given instructions for Lovenox as a bridge.
She was kept on Metoprolol XL 25 po qd.
# PUMP: The patient was found to have systolic heart failure with an EF of 30% with a dilated LV cavity and [**1-25**]+ MR. BNP was 9991.
She was started on Lisinopril 5mg po qd and Metoprolol XL 25 mg daily.
She was started on Aspirin 162mg po qd.
Diuresis at OSH and [**Hospital1 **] has improved her symptoms of SOB, peripheral edema, lung exam, JVD.
No splenomegaly on CT. Hematology was consulted and they think bone marrow replacement process is unlikely, more possibly due to chronic compensated ITP.
# RENAL: Urine lytes collected after Lasix doses here and at OSH but FEurea is equivocal.
Urology was consulted and they recommended abdominal MRI with and without contrast as an inpatient, however the patient refused and would rather follow up at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] as an outpatient.
She had some hematuria while on heparin with the Foley catheter in place but it resolved after the Foley was removed.
On discharge her Creatinine was 1.6 which can be attributed to starting Lisinopril and recent contrast dye load.

Lisinopril 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).

You were also started on amiodarone to prevent the reoccurance of atrial flutter.
You will need to take Lovenox until the INR is 2.0-3.0.
START Lisinopril, to help your heart pump better and control your blood pressure.
START Lovenox 60 mg twice daily to prevent blood clots.
