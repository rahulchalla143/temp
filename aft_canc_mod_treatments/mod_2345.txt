-------------------INTERPHASE FISH ANALYSIS, 100-300 CELLS-------------------   FISH evaluation for a MLL rearrangement was performed on nuclei with the LSI MLL Dual Color, Break Apart Probe (Vysis) at 11q23 and is interpreted as ABNORMAL.
A MLL rearrangement is found in a subset of cases of ALL and AML, and is associated with oncogenic fusions between MLL and various partner genes.
A normal EGR1 FISH finding can result from absence of a 5q deletion, from a 5q deletion that does not involve the region to which this probe hybridizes, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
FISH evaluation for a 7q deletion was performed with the Vysis D7S522/CEP7 Dual Color Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for D7S522 at 7q31 and CEP7 (D7Z1) (chromosome 7 alpha satellite DNA) at 7p11.1-q11.1 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
A normal D7S522 FISH finding can result from the absence of a 7q deletion, from a 7q deletion that does not involve the region to which this probe hybridizes, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.
FISH evaluation for a 20q deletion was performed with the Vysis LSI D20S108 Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) at 20q12 and is interpreted as NORMAL.
Two hybridization signals were observed in 97/100 nuclei examined, which is within the normal range established for this probe in the Cytogenetics Laboratory at [**Hospital1 18**].
A normal 20q FISH finding can result from absence of a 20q deletion, from a 20q deletion that does not involve the region to which this probe hybridizes, or from an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.

Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 77M with 2-3 weeks of fatigue, found to have elevated white count, diagnosed with AML s/p decitabine ([**8-18**]).
The patient was having symptoms concerning for leukostasis such as cardiac demand ischemia with troponin leaks.
The patient also received multiple treatments of hydroxyurea.
These treatments decreased his WBC into normal range.
Allopurinol was started and the patient also received Rasburicase, along with IVF with bicarb to a goal urine output of 100 cc/hour.
The patient's options were discussed and he decided to pursue treatment with Decitabine which he received his first infusion on [**2108-8-18**].
He received 5 days of Decitabine with a resultant drop in all of his cell lines.
He received a unit of platelets just prior to discharge and was instructed to follow up in the [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] 7 outpatient clinic on monday.
He was given IVF and his creatinine slowly returned to baseline.
He was treated with cefepime and vancomycin for broad antibiotic coverage.
Vancomycin was discontinued and Cefepime was continued.
His urine from [**8-15**] grew out Beta streptococcus group B.
A repeat urine culture from [**8-29**] showed no growth after treatment with cefipime.
The patient was treated with warm compresses and the pain resolved.
# Hypertension - The patient was continued on his home blood pressure medications with good control.
His amlodipine and lisinopril was discontinued, and his bp remained stable.
# Petechial rash - the patient had a petechial rash which was noticed on the day of his discharge.
The rash was present only in dependent areas of his body, including his feet and buttocks.
Medications on Admission: Lupron Lisinopril Metoprolol Pravastatin Prilosec   Discharge Medications: 1.
Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO once a day.
Pravastatin 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.
You also received decitabine, a type of chemotherapy for your leukemia, which you tolerated well.
During your admission, we gave you some platelets because they became low because of your chemotherapy.
Some medication changes have been made: - Your Procardia has been stopped.
- Do not take your aspirin, because your platelets are low and taking aspirin can cause you to bleed.
Please take all medications as prescribed.
