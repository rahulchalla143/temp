The patient was subsequently referred to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] for evaluation and thereafter scheduled for a mediastinoscopy with a right upper lobe resection on [**2132-5-19**].
Status post mechanical mitral valve replacement in [**2115**].
Status post left inguinal hernia repair.
Coumadin 5 mg p.o.
Digoxin 215 micrograms p.o.
Dilantin 100 mg p.o.
Toprol XL 50 mg p.o.
Zestril 5 mg p.o.
The patient was begun on a heparin drip at a rate of 1000 cc.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and required one unit of fresh frozen plasma and three units of packed red blood cells interoperatively.
On postoperative check, the patient was noted to be afebrile and stable with a 91% oxygen saturation on a 40% face mask and a postoperative hematocrit of 32.2.
A right sided chest tube was noted to be in place with evidence of a small leak and moderate drainage to low continuous wall suction.
Postoperative pain control was provided via PCA.
The patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy who continued to follow the patient for the duration of his stay and recommended to patient to [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation following resolution of his acute medical issues.
The patient was restarted on his Coumadin therapy but was shortly thereafter noted to be supra-therapeutic with an INR of 3.1.
The patient's Coumadin was subsequently discontinued pending resolution of his super-therapeutic status and further investigation as to the etiology of his hyper-sensitivity.
Following identification of his super-therapeutic status, the patient was again noted to have transient worsening of his respiratory examination, instigating a repeat bronchoscopy on [**2132-5-23**].
The patient was thereafter begun on aggressive chest Physical Therapy and an aspiration work-up was begun.
Serial video swallow studies were thereafter obtained, which initially demonstrated total intolerance of thin liquids and marginal tolerance of soft solids and nectar thickened liquids.
Given these results, as well as the patient's apparent propensity for hyper-sensitivity to Coumadin therapy, it was thought that the patient was a significant risk for malnutrition and he was subsequently fitted with a Dobbhoff feeding tube for direct gastric feeding.
and on tube feeds through postoperative day number eight, during which time he was noted to exhibit improved clinical status.
The patient was restarted on his Coumadin therapy and was subsequently gradually titrated to a target INR of 2.5.
The patient's chest tube was subsequently removed without complications and the patient demonstrated a continued adequate oxygen saturation on minimal supplemental O2 therapy.
Despite these findings, it was thought that the patient would benefit from a feeding trial and he was subsequently re-instituted on soft solid diet and thickened nectar liquids with Boost supplements on [**5-30**].
The patient was thereafter noted to be tolerant of this modified diet and his tube feeds were entirely discontinued.
