He was worked with Myoview apical inferoseptal ischemia was found with an ejection fraction around 50%.
The plan was to have the patient return to the catheterization laboratory the following afternoon for bilateral renal artery stenting with surgical revascularization to follow.
Patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x3 [**2196-12-30**].
Patient had left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal.
Total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 119 minutes with a cross-clamp time of 62 minutes.
The patient was transferred in normal sinus rhythm to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit on propofol at 30 and nitroglycerin at 0.5.
Because there was questionable plaque in the aorta, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] requested a neurologic assessment on the patient, therefore the patient was reversed and passed the neurologic assessment, but because the patient's blood pressures were up in the 180s and 190s, the patient was placed on propofol to try to get the blood pressure back under control.
Patient still had difficulty with his blood pressures staying high in the 140s to 160s while on Nipride and nitroglycerin as well as propofol, however, there was a period at which time the blood pressure dipped down to 70s, at which time all of the hypertensive medications were stopped with a little Neo-Synephrine and fluid bolus given which resolved the issue.
Nipride was then restarted which maintained the blood pressure in the 120-130 range.
Plan was to restart the patient's beta blockers, to administer 20 mg of Lasix [**Hospital1 **], to administer hydralazine to keep the blood pressure under control, and to continue the chest tube since the patient still had a high output, and to restart the patient the dimension medications.
Postoperative day two, 24 hour events included the removal of the Swan and the restarting of the patient's beta blockers and Lasix.
Chest tubes still putting out serosanguinous fluid.
Plan was to watch chest tube output with the hope of discontinuing the chest tubes today with the plan to start discharge planning.
Postoperative day five, patient still with blood pressure control issues, afebrile in sinus rhythm at 64, though with a blood pressure of 174/88, sating at 95 on room air with a white count of 9.2, hematocrit of 31.1, BUN of 26, creatinine 1.0, glucose of 83.
Plan is to titrate captopril as needed in order to lower the blood pressure.
Postoperative day six, patient still with persistent hypertension, however, doing very well otherwise despite multiple medication adjustments, still afebrile in sinus rhythm at 80 with a plan to continue to titrate captopril and possibly switching over to Accupril which the patient was on preoperatively.
