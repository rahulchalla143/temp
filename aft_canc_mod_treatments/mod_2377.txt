History of Present Illness: This is a 39-year-old gentleman with NHL s/p alloSCT [**2155**] and DLI [**2156**], in remission but with chronic GVHD including bronchiolitis obliterans and severe restrictive lung disease being admitted from [**Hospital1 **] with hypoxia to 82%, increased yellow-white secretions, and respirtory distress.
Tmax at rehab was [**Age over 90 **]F. He received Meropenem 500mg and brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
Of note, he was recently discharged on [**3-16**] after 2 month hospital stay complicated by repeated respiratory failure ultimately requiring trach ([**3-8**]) and VAP.
He was initially treated with Vancomycin/Meropenem/Bactrim, but this was later tailored to Meropenem and Tobramycin for ESBL Klebs double coverage.
He was later transitioned to ceftriaxone monotherapy when further lab investigation confirmed sensitivity.
He was readmitted and discharged on [**4-6**] for clogged NG tube and new Dobhoff placed.
Given Tylenol and Vancomycin, afebrile on time of transfer to ICU.
- Treated with six cycles of CHOP/Rituxan with good response, but showed evidence for relapse in [**12/2154**] and was treated with MINE chemotherapy for two cycles.
- [**2156-7-29**]: Nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant with a [**5-30**] HLA-matched unrelated donor with Campath conditioning  - Six-month follow-up CT noted for disease progression.
- [**1-/2157**]: Received donor lymphocyte infusion in , complicated by acute liver/GI GVHD grade IV, for which [**Known firstname **] required a prolonged hospitalization in the summer of [**2156**].
- [**2157-12-28**] Photophoresis was d/c'd due to episodes of bacteremia and eventual removal of his apheresis catheter.
- undergone phlebotomy due to iron overload with corresponding drop in his ferritin.
He has continued with transient rises in his transaminases and bilirubin and has remained on varying doses of CellCept and prednisone which has been slowly tapered over the time.
After extensive workup, this was felt related to an infection and required several admissions with completion of antibiotics in 03/[**2158**].
- [**2160-10-20**]: URI and treatment with course of Levaquin.
- [**2160-11-13**] completed a 4 week course of Rituxan to treat his GVHD.
-In [**5-/2161**], noted to have tiny echogenic nodule on abdominal [**Year (4 digits) 950**].
MRI of the liver also showed this nodule but was not as concerning on review and he is due to have a repeat MRI imaging in early [**Month (only) **].
He has been on a low dose beta blocker as well as simvastatin, which was started on [**2161-7-7**] to help with medical management of his varices.
This has essentially resolved over time - Issues with weight loss (followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]); multiple tests done with no etiology found; question malabsorption related to GVHD - Has on and off respiratory infections and has been treated with antibiotics with possible pneumonia.
Grade 4 Acute GVHD of GI/liver following DLI with GI bleed, chronic transaminitis, portal HTN with esophageal varices (not able to band) 3.
Grade II esophageal varices, intollerant to beta blockade.
Stays at home and writes (currently writing a book on being diagnosed with cancer at young age).
Family History: Without history of lymphoma or other cancers in the family No FHx of DM or HTN Mother: Alive, Thyroid disease Father: CAD with ecent cardiac cath with angioplasty of 2 vessels, asthma 2 older brothers: alive and well.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] is a 39-year-old gentleman with chronic repiratory failure, vent dependent, secondary to GVHD-associated bronchiolitis obliterans who was admitted for ventilator associated pneumonia with sputum cultures growing multiple strains of multi-drug resistant pseudomonas.
# PSEUDOMONAS PNA:  Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] has had numerous strains of high resistant pseudomonas, and had been on tobramycin prophylaxis prior to admission.
He was initially started on meropenem and as sensitivites changed, antibiotics were switched to ceftazidime, amikacin and eventually colistin.
Vanco IV and flagyl were added as well, as Mr. [**Known lastname 38651**] white count seemed to go down on these medications.
On the recommendation of the infectious disease consulting team, he was started on both inhaled and intravenous colistin in addition to amikacin.
Patient should remain on inhaled colistin, intravenous colistin, and amikacin through [**5-26**].
After that, he should continue on inhaled colistin three times a week until directed otherwise by the infectious disease doctors.
Vancomycin and flagyl were discontinued prior to discharge.
We also encourage aggressive chest physical therapy and frequent suctioning to help with secretions.
Patient's left PICC line was pulled on [**4-30**]; he was started on IV vancomycin for empiric gram positive coverage and this was continued despite a negative catheter tip culture.
Moreover, patient was treated with flagyl despite multiple negative stool samples for clostridium difficile.
There was also concern for infection at the site of previous PICC line in LUE however, [**Month/Day (4) 950**] was negative for fluid collection or other signs of infection.
Finally, it was thought that fevers/white count may be the results of underlying GVHD, and prednisone was increased from 15mg to 40mg; however, as fevers resolved and white count remained stable, prednisone was decreased to baseline of 15mg QD.
Ms. [**Known lastname 38598**] was put on the colistin and amikacin above at the advice of the ID team.
The vancomycin and the flagyl were discontinued as per ID and heme/onc recommendations.
Upon discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] was doing well on pressure support; he was encouraged to remain on PS during the day and AC at night.
He was aggressively suctioned and given mucomyst and bronchodilators.
His prednisone was increased on [**5-5**] and subsequently tapered back to his prior dosage of 15mg QD.
He was continued on his monthly IVIG and received a dose on [**4-18**] and on [**5-13**].
Heparin subcu (prophylaxis) was increased from 2500 to 5000 units subcu TID.
FEEDING TUBE:  In the past, issue of a PEG or G-tube was discussed with GI.
ELEVATED CREATININE:  Creatinine rose from 0.2 to 0.4 after patient was started on nephrotoxic drugs including colistin and amikacin.
Patient's creatinine should be followed closely while at rehab, and outside providers contact[**Name (NI) **] if it begins to rise further.

We also found a clot in your left arm, likely the result of a PICC line that had been placed there.
We increased your heparin to 5000 units every day, which should provide better protection against developing these clots again.
Please take all of your medications as prescribed.
