PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on admission revealed the patient had an unremarkable Chemistry-7, complete blood count, and coagulation studies.
Given the size of his mass, it was thought that embolization prior to operative removal would be appropriate.
He underwent embolization as a two-stage procedure on [**7-27**].
He tolerated the procedure well, and his mass notably shrank following embolization.
On [**7-28**], the patient was taken to the operating room for removal of his paraganglioma.
The patient tolerated the procedure quite well; however, his paraganglioma enclosed both his internal and external carotid and was difficult to resect.
They assisted in the operating room and performed a saphenous vein graft once the paraganglioma was removed.
The ganglioma was removed with all nerves identified.
For this reason, a feeding tube was placed to provide enteral nutrition.
For this reason, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was decided to be placed by the Interventional Radiology Service.
Initially, a gastrojejunostomy tube was placed.
This allowed for continuous tube feedings.
He tolerated his tube feeds well.
However, the gastrojejunostomy tube had to be switched over to a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube to perform bolus feedings.
He tolerated both feedings well.
