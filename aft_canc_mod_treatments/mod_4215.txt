He required 5-6L supplemental O2 and was transferred to MICU for closer monitoring and further care.
While in the MICU and in light of the patient's worsening respiratory status, low platelet count and contraindications to anticoagulation and obtaining any biopsy of the lung to secure a diagnosis, and metastatic cancer, decision was made to transition the patient to comfort measures with the patient's two sons and wife.
# SIRS: Patient spiking fevers to 101.6 with SBP in the 80s as well as tachypnea, tachycardia, and lactate 2.9.
Hypotension initially responded to IV fluids.
Started on empiric vancomycin and cefepime, in addition to stress dose steroids given longstanding prednisone treatment.
Transferred to ICU for further management.
Likely secondary to a combination of bone mets, congestive hepatopathy, splenic sequestration, and medications (Samarium).
Retic count of 3.6 does not suggest profound bone marrow suppression.
Continued pain control with oxycodone and prednisone (then stress dose steroids, see above).
# DMII: Continued home 30 units 70/30 at breakfast and dinner and HISS  # HYPOTHYROIDISM - Continued levothyroxine  # Transitional: as above, patient passed peacefully with family at beside.
