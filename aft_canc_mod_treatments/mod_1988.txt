Admission Date:  [**2148-2-5**]       Discharge Date: [**2148-2-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2086-10-30**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old Caucasian male with a complex medical history including multiple myeloma diagnosed in [**2136**], now status post XRT and undergoing treatment with Decadron and thalidomide, status post laminectomy at L4, S1, and a left epidural tumor removal in [**2147-7-14**] complicated by months of hospitalization for various wound infections and debridements who presents with serous drainage from his back.
The patient underwent a laminectomy at L4-S1 and left epidural tumor removal in [**2147-7-14**] and was subsequently readmitted for fevers/wound infection with gram-negative rods and MRSA complicated by sepsis.
He was prescribed at that time with six weeks of vancomycin and subsequently suffered a left parietal cerebrovascular accident, atrial arrhythmias, and sick sinus syndrome, with continual leakage from his flap site eventually requiring a bilateral V-Y fasciocutaneous flap in [**2147-10-14**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of Plastic Surgery.
The patient was given 20 mg IV and 50 mg IV of Diltiazem and 60 mg p.o.
The patient was then hydrated with IV fluids and given 3 grams of IV Unasyn, 2 mg of Dilaudid and transferred for a question of sepsis.
Multiple myeloma with XRT and Decadron in the past, now on thalidomide.
Status post laminectomy, L4-S1, and left epidural tumor removal in [**2147-7-14**], complicated by three to four months of hospitalizations and various complications including MRSA debridement with flap closure, left parietal CVA, atrial arrhythmias, and a bilateral V-Y fasciocutaneous flap.
Sick sinus syndrome/atrial fibrillation, currently followed by a cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**].
Neurontin 900 mg t.i.d.
Coumadin 7 mg q.d.
Dexamethasone 2 mg q. week.
Thalidomide 200 q.d.
Depakote 750 mg b.i.d.
Vitamin D 400 units q.d.
Nystatin 15 milliliters swish and swallow q.d.
The patient was briefly on Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure control but after one day was weaned off and was hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of his hospital stay.
The patient was continued on a beta blocker for rate control for the recommendation of the Electrophysiology/Cardiology Service who followed the patient throughout this admission.
Given his history of atrial fibrillation, the patient was also maintained on Coumadin with a heparin drip until his INR was therapeutic for 48 hours.
The Electrophysiology Consult Service recommended the patient having a repeat echocardiogram six weeks after discharge as well as possible cardioversion after one month of therapeutic anticoagulation.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was admitted with serous drainage from his lower back with an extensive history of wound infections status post laminectomy and epidural tumor removal.
The Plastic Surgery and Neurosurgery teams were consulted and did not feel that surgical excision or intervention was warranted and recommended continuing antibiotics.
The Infectious Disease Consult Service was contact[**Name (NI) **] and recommended vancomycin and Meropenem for broad spectrum coverage.
The Interventional Radiation Consult Service was contact[**Name (NI) **] to aspirate this fluid collection and the patient was taken for a CT-guided aspiration on [**2148-2-9**], the results of which are pending at the time of this dictation.
The patient received a PICC line and will receive IV antibiotics for at least four weeks given a concern for possible osteomyelitis.
ONCOLOGY:  The patient was admitted with a history of multiple myeloma on thalidomide and Decadron.
These medications were continued.
The patient also has a history of a DVT and atrial fibrillation and was continued on heparin and Coumadin as noted above until her INR is therapeutic for 48 hours.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient was placed on zinc and vitamin C for wound healing.
ENDOCRINE:  Given the patient's hypotension, there was a concern for adrenal insufficiency in this patient who has been on chronic steroids for his multiple myeloma.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test was performed and the patient did not respond appropriately according to the sepsis protocol and was placed on three days of stress dose steroids for potential adrenal insufficiency.
