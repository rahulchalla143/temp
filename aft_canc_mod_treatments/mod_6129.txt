# anemia: The patient initially presented with new crit drop in the setting of chemotherapy about three weeks ago.
It is possible that this new anemia is related to chemo, however, given the acute nature of drop, a more acute process is likely.

His ASA and Plavix were initially held.
His metoprolol and ASA were both restarted.

His coumadin was held initially given his supratherapeutic INR.
After getting FFP and Vitamin K, the patient's INR normalized.
Prior to discharge he was restarted on coumadin 2.5 mg daily.
The patient's rate was controlled with metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].
