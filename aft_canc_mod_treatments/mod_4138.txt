She was taken to [**Hospital1 18**] ED where temp was 104.8 and SBP was in the 80s - it transiently increased with IVF then required many boluses IVF; patient was treated with vanco and flagyl, 4L IVF, LP was negative with neg cx (though no OP recorded, and only 4cc fluid sent) and she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]/[**Hospital Ward Name 516**] for further workup of what was thought at the time to be sepsis.
She was intubated for airway protection with change in MS, later extubated without event on [**3-21**].
She was initially started on Aggrenox and switched to Plavix; she is now on plavix, aspirin, a statin, and on an ACE-I as her BP is more stable with stress-dose steroids.
One possible mechanism for her stroke (also suggested by PCP) was viral illness with poor endogenous steroid response related to panhypopit and resulting functional adrenal crisis.
She was continued on continue current meds from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]; lytes and dilantin level were monitored and were within goal range (dilantin level 16.4 on [**3-23**]), stroke workup was completed including Hba1c of 5.9, FLP pending.
With dementia and comorbidities, she was felt to be a poor candidate for surgical correction of carotid stenosis; stent is one possibility, but as the other carotid is completely occluded, it might be a risky procedure.
She was also felt to be a he will be a poor coumadin candidate secondary to poor vision and now a fall risk due to hemiplegia.
She was continued on aspirin and plavix.
