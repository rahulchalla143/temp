Her bleeding slowed down as her INR was reversed with FFP and Vitamin K.      After her Hct was stable and bleeding was controlled, she was transferred to the floor.
She was briefly placed on a heparin drip to observe for further evidence of bleeding, although this was stopped after she had some continued vaginal bleeding.
Ob/gyn was consulted regarding the post-menopausal vaginal bleeding, they had recently performed a very technically challenging biopsy for the same issue which did not show evidence of malignancy, but was a limited sample.
A repeat transvaginal US was obtained during this admission which was unable to comment on uterine dimensions but again noted calcified fibroids, including a submucosal fibroid.
# Coagulopathy: The patient takes coumadin at home for afib, but had stopped since 2 [**Known lastname **] prior to admission.
Initial labs in the ED revealed a PTT of 150 and INR >19 without history of heparin containing products.
Pt received FFP and Vitamin K in the ED and her INR corrected to 1.2 in the MICU.
INR remained mildly elevated around 1.2-1.5 despite being off of Coumadin for many [**Known lastname **].
She has been off Coumadin given her ongoing bleeding.
We have informed her of the risk of stroke being off Coumadin and the fact that there is no suitable alternative given her continued vaginal bleeding.
[**Last Name (STitle) 9006**] were notified about the short term plan to hold coumadin until the bleeding has resolved but she will need to anti-coagulated again soon.
She was treated with Levaquin for 8 [**Known lastname **] given her history of multiple antibiotic allergies.
She was diuresed, although we are unable to assess the response as her volume status is impossible to determine given body habitus.
However, her LFTS did improve with diuresis and pt was discharged on lasix 20mg daily.
#Insulin Insensitivity:  Patient was admitted with diagnosis of "pre-diabetes" was placed on insulin sliding scale which was not utilized.
#OSA - She continued to wear CPAP with oxygen at night during her hospitalization.
Transitional Care: -Has follow-up arranged with ob/gyn regarding fibroids and vaginal bleeding -Will need to have her metoprolol dose monitored, this was increased during her hospitalization -She has been discharged without anticoagulation for her AF, the issue of anti-coagulation will need to be re-addressed after her bleeding stops.
Dabigatran may be an option for anti-coagulation as she has been supratherapeutic with significant bleeding on warfarin.
