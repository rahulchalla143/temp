On cardiac catheterization he demonstrated low pressure tamponade with equalization of right atrium and pericardial pressures.
CT Surgery was consulted for possibility of placing a pericardial window for definitive treatment of recurrent pericardial effusions however, it was felt that a procedure of this degree of invasiveness would likely lead to patient's deterioration rather than improvement.
The decision was made that the patient would be best served by a balloon pericardiocentesis via catheter done by Cardiology however, this would require waiting until the pericardial effusion re-accumulated.
The patient's cardiac status improved with this procedure however, his respiratory status remained tenuous requiring 100% non-rebreather mask to maintain O2 saturations in the mid-90%  The patient had marked dyspnea on exertion throughout hospitalization.
The patient remained on Sotalol 80 mg p.o.
The patient continued XRT as well as Decadron for palliation.
