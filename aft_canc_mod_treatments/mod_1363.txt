He went to the dialysis as scheduled, however post dialysis he had six episodes of emesis, non-bloody containing food material.
He therefore received 10 units of regular insulin three times and then started on insulin drip.

He was started on insulin drip and aggressive hydration which lead to quick resolution of his symptoms.
In the hospital he was left on NPH insulin 20 units in the morning and 8 units at night with very good glucose control, however he did occasionally require encouraging intakes of p.o.
A consultation with the Heart Failure Service was obtained and their recommendations included continuing beta blocker and ACE inhibitor as started by the patient as well as aspirin and Plavix.
We decided to obtain on the day of discharge, another cardiac echocardiogram now that his cardiac function has somewhat stabilized to assess his ejection fraction and to determine the for systemic coagulation if he has a low ejection fraction.
He received a full seven day course of Ceftriaxone for possible pneumonia during his stay on the regular medical floor.
