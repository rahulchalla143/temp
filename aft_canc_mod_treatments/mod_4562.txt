Patient was on high dose IL-2 which finished yesterday with complications as stated above.
Because of the hypotension patient was started on dopamine (6mcg/kg/min), however, last night she went into wide complex tachycardia (cards fellow thinks SVT) which resolved with down-titration of dopamine.

The patient was also noted to be increasingly hypoxic, likely [**1-27**] capillary leak and CHF, requiring intubation soon after admission.
For her hypotension, she was started on empiric antibiotic treatment with vanc/cefepime/flagyl and stress dose steroids.
She required increasing amounts of pressor support, and eventually was on maximum doses of three pressors with persistent hypotension noted on the evening of admission.
