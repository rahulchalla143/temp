HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66-year-old white female with a history of biliary colic, status post ERCP and cholecystectomy, possible cholangiocarcinoma, hypertension, and [**Hospital **] transferred to the Intensive Care Unit status post an emergent ERCP.
The patient developed biliary colic approximately one year ago and was found to have gallstones and a common bile duct stone, for which she underwent ERCP with papillotomy and subsequently a cholecystectomy.
In the interim, the patient also underwent an umbilical hernia repair.
The patient's pain was somewhat controlled with MS Contin and Oxycontin IR, but this was complicated by altered mental status.
The patient developed a sinus tachycardia on [**2112-3-2**] with report of anterolateral ST changes on EKG and positive troponin by report.
Because of confusion, increasing white blood cell count, the patient was begun on Tequin and gentamicin for empiric coverage for cholangitis.
The patient was given ceftriaxone 1 gram and vancomycin 1 gram prior to ERCP at the [**Hospital1 69**].
At ERCP, intrahepatic ductal stricturing and common bile duct stricturing were noted for which the patient received common bile duct stents times two.
Because of the severe pain and altered mental status, the patient was electively intubated for the procedure and a right internal jugular central venous line was placed.
PULMONARY:  The patient was electively intubated prior to her procedure.
She remained on minimal ventilatory support on low pressor support settings.
Given the probable metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, the patient was evaluated by General Surgery and the Biliary Service and felt to have a very dismal overall prognosis for treatment or recovery.
The patient's total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase then gradually trended down.
She was empirically covered on vancomycin, Levaquin, and Flagyl for empiric coverage of cholangitis.
On [**2112-3-7**], after allowing Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and her son in-law to visit extensively with the patient, the patient was extubated and the code status was changed to comfort measures only.
The patient is now currently on a morphine and Ativan drip at the time of this dictation.
