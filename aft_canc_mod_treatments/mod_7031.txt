Brief Hospital Course: 74 yo M w/ h/o DM and prostate ca s/p resection presenting with DOE and RLE found to have submassive PE and new lung mass and right pleural effusion.
Pt was initially treated with heparin drip, Given extensive pulmonary emboli, RLE DVT, and possible malignancy with unclear plans for further workup, a retrievable IVC filter was placed by interventional radiology without issue.
Pt was discharged on enoxaparin 90mcg sc bid and sent with home O2 for sleep and comfort during exertion.
Pt was treated with heparin drip and enoxaparin 90mcg sc bid as above for pulmonary embolism.
Pt's right lower extremity swelling improved rapidly with anticoagulation and by date of discharge, his lower extremities were equal in size.
Other possibilities include maligancy (particularly in setting of nodules and LAD) vs. infectious vs. autoimmune.
Protein 3.1, Glucose 143, LD 154, cholesterol 57. pH 7.53.
Pt was scheduled for outpatient follow-up with interventional pulmonology in 2 weeks.
Pt felt some relief with [**Year (4 digits) 108422**]-codeine syrup and was discharged with a prescription.
#) Fever / urinary tract infection: temp to 100.4 on [**3-7**], initially suspected clot fever from thrombus/embolism resorption.

You were started on blood thinners to treat these clots in the intensive care unit and stabilized before you were transferred to the medical floor.
You had a filter placed in your inferior vena cava to prevent further blood clots from migrating to your lungs.
For this reason, you will continue to take enoxaparin (Lovenox) while your lung mass workup plans are still being finalized.
Although you are breathing much better now, we have arranged for oxygen to be provided for you at home in case you need it.
We have made the following changes to your medications:  STOP taking furosemide (lasix) (you were on this for presumed congestive heart failure, but you do not have this diagnosis)  START using oxygen via nasal canula as needed START taking ciprofloxacin 500mg tablets, one tab by mouth every 12 hours for 2 weeks START using enoxaparin (Lovenox) subcutaneous injections, 100mg, every 12 hours until instructed to stop by your doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] taking [**Name5 (PTitle) 108422**] AC (with codeine) 10-100 mg/5 mL Liquid  Five mL by mouth every four hours as needed for cough: Do not drive or operate machinery on this medication.
