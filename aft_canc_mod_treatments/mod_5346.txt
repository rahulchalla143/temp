He was taken to [**Hospital1 **] hosptial where he was given pain control and had a chest tube placed in his left 5th intercostal space.
He also has had shingles on his left leg, and has been on valtrex for this.
His immunosuppression was recently decreased due to voriconazole.
ED course: He was given IV dilaudid in the ED, seen by thoracic surgery, and admitted to medicine for workup.
Past Medical History: AML s/p transplant [**2187**] ?
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Gen- Cachectic, pale, ill appearing male, uncomfortable Heent- MMdry, blood in mouth and nares, anicteric Neck- supple, no LAD Cor- tachy, regular, s1,s2 Chest- breath sounds bilateral, rhonchorous anteriorly; chest tube draining serosanguinous fluid, no bleeding at site Abd- soft, tender at g tube site, no g/r.
IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate left hydropneumothorax with lateral apical chest tube in place.
CHEST CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST [**2189-7-2**]: TECHNIQUE: MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images through the chest without administration of IV contrast.
Vague ground-glass and centrilobular opacities, most pronounced in the right middle lobe, medial left upper lobe, and in dependent portions of both lower lobes, along with bronchial wall thickening, most pronounced in the right upper lobe and left lower lobe, all reflect endobronchial infection.
The left chest tube enters between the sixth and seventh ribs anterolaterally, courses to the lung apex; it is not contiguous with the loculated fluid at the left lung base.
Right PICC terminates in the cavoatrial junction.
A gastrostomy tube is only partially imaged.
Moderate left hydropneumothorax, including basal fluid loculations not traversed by pleural drain.
Pleural fluid cytology: neg for malignant cells  EMG [**2189-7-3**]: FINDINGS: Motor nerve conduction study (NCSs) of the left median nerve were normal, including F waves.
Motor NCSs of the left tibial nerve showed normal distal latency, moderate reduction of response amplitude, and mild slowing of conduction velocity.
Slow (3-Hz) repetitive nerve stimulation of the left ulnar nerve, recording abductor digiti minimi, showed no decremental response at baseline, immediately after 1 minute of maximal voluntary contraction, or at 1-minute intervals following maximal voluntary effort out to 5 minutes.
Slow (3-Hz) repetitive nerve stimulation of the left spinal accessory nerve, recording trapzeius, showed no decremental response at baseline, immediately after 1 minute of maximal voluntary contraction, or at 1-minute intervals following maximal voluntary out to 4 minutes, though the study was technically limited by movement.
EMG examination of the tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius was normal.

His pain meds were decreased without much effect on his respiratory status.
[**Name (NI) 1094**] PTX was treated w/ chest tube On [**2189-7-3**], pt noted to be increasingly tachypnic and fatigued.
[Of note, pt consented to intubation prior to procedure.]
He was maintained on light sedation.
Pt was started on linezolid and zosyn for coverage of possible PNA, though no clear infiltrate on CT.  # Pneumothorax:  No history of this before.
Pt had chest tube placed at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] (as [**Hospital1 112**] on divert).
CT surgery consulted.
They adjusted chest tube with initial improvement in respiratory status & improvement of CXR.
Chest Tube placed to suction.
He needs to have chest tube evaluated by thoracics to see if it needs to be readjusted or pulled.
Immunosuppresive medications were continued as were his prophylactive anti-biotics, atovaquone & voriconazole.
# Pain: Low dose dilaudid and fentanyl patch.
However, since he was allergic to this he was started on linezolid.
Zosyn was also started for concern of PNA as an infectious source.
# Depression: continue celexa and remeron  # Nausea: His tube feed have recently been on hold due to high residuals.
Cont to increase TF's and check residuals; can use reglan as needed to help w/ motility.
# FEN: Tube feeds as tolerated; regular diet, reglan  # PPx: SC heparin, tums  # Code: full  # Communication: father   Medications on Admission: Atovaquone, calcium, cipro eye gtt, citalopram, colace, fentanyl patch, folate, lasix, neurontin, levoflox, ativan, reglan, lopressor, mirtazapine, mvi, MMF, prednisone, senna, Tacro, Zosyn, Urodiol, Valtrex, Vori, Albuterol/Ipratrop, lactulose, dilaudid  Discharge Medications: 1.
