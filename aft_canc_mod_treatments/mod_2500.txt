Paracentesis  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 39760**] is a 76 y/o F with history of autoimmune hepatitis, diastolic CHF, hypertension, T2DM, as well as abdominal B cell lymphoma recently diagnosed by ex lap in [**Month (only) **], who presents to the hospital after presenting to onc clinic for C2D6 R-CHOP and was found to have abdominal pain, hypotension, and Afib with RVR.
was recently discharged from the [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-4**] to rehabilitation and was doing well until several days ago when she began to have back and abdominal pain.
She was treated with narcotics but grew confused.
Urgent cultures and labs were drawn and the patient was started on fluid resusitation and received 2grams cefepime, 50mg hydorcortisone (due to recent steroid taper) and was sent to the emergency room with flagyl 500mg hanging.
Vanco and cefepime were also started at clinic en route to the ICU.
She was started on tylenol.
She received another 50 mg of hydrocort in the ED in addition to the 50 mg received in onc clinic for a total of 100mg.
also received 3mg of morphin for pain.

Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 39760**] is a 76 y/o F with history of autoimmune hepatitis, diastolic CHF, hypertension, T2DM, as well as abdominal B cell lymphoma recently diagnosed by ex lap in [**Month (only) 1096**], who presents with fever, abdominal pain, hypotension, confusion and AF with RVR and was found to be in neutropenic sepsis with initial shock requiring pressor support.
This was removed and she was treated with broad spectrum Abx.
She improved with antibiotics and was diuresed.
Rate control was difficult and required several IV agents initially until she was transitioned to an oral regime.
She was anticoagulated with enoxaparin once her Plt were >50 and GCSF was stopped when she was no longer significantly neutropenic.
# Neutropenic sepsis with shock: The likely sourec was line infection due to an indwelling RIJV CVC through which she had been receiving TPN at rehab.
Patient was admitted in neutropenic sepsis, fulfilling SIRS criteria with tachycardia, high RR, fever and neutropenia.
She was initially hypotensive to 70/63 in teh ED and she was fluid resuscitatted and started on IV phenylephrine.
Her pressors were rapidly weaned and BPs stabilised.
She was therefore treated broadly with IV cefepime, vancomycin and metronidazoel t cover possible abdominal source.
She was treated with GCSF for her low ounts in the setting of her sepsis.
Due to teh likely source of her infection being her CVC, she had a new central line placed [**1-11**].
Her counts improved and GCS was stopped on [**1-15**] given her rebounding WBC.
ID were consulted adn they recommended a TEE which has been requested.
Their plan for antibiotics was to treat for 4 weks if there were no vegetations on TEE and 6 weeks if there were vegetations present.
They also felt that as her CVC had been replaced during a time of bacteremia that this should be removed and this occurred on [**1-17**] when she had a further left IJV CVC inserted as hematology were not keen for a tunnelled line and previous PICC attempts had failed in the past.
Given her rebounding WCC cefepime was stopped on [**1-15**] and metronidazole was stopped when there seemed little evidence of an abdominal source for her sepsis and after surgical review although it was latterly restarted on [**1-18**] when she was no longer neutropenic in the setting of loose stools to cover for psossible c difficile.
# Anasarca: Patient was admitted with profound anasarca in the context of hypoalbuminemia.
Pt grossly anasarcic even on prior dischage ([**1-4**]) with albumin of 1.9 on [**1-1**].
Pt had been started on TPN for deficient nutrition before discharge to [**Hospital1 **] and was still on TPN at time of readmission.
She had profound ascites and this was began to profusely drain from her abdomen at the start of her [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU stay.
Her abdominal wound had areas without skin closure (although fascial planes were closed) and her draining ascites as initially treated with wound bag and latterly after surgical review with a wouund vac.
After initial rehydration and pressors stabilised her BP she was not given further excess hydration and she was diuresed with an IV furosemide infusion and her edema improved.
She diuresed well and was transitioned from an IV infusion to IV furosemide boluses with a good response to this.
To address her hypoalbuminemia, we encourage PO intake but this was poor and she received TPN in addition.
# Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  Patient had a hx of chronic AF in the past on prior [**Hospital1 18**] admission and was previously controlled on oral metoprolol to good effect.
She had been anticoagulated with fondaparinux given a questionable episode of thrombocytopenia in the context of her chemotherapy but this was held in the setting of her thrombocytopenia post R-CHOP.
She was initially tachycardic to 170s in the ED and was given IV diltiazem but latterly was started on an esmolol infusion on transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] but this was unsuccessful in controlling her HR and she was then transitioned to a diltiazem infusion.
This again was inefective n controlling her rate sand she was started on an IV amiodarone infusion given borderline BPs.
She was chanegd to oral amiodarone and initially required intermittent IV metoprolol boluses for episodic tachycardia.
She will have a tapering dose of oral amiodarone with 400mg po bid for a total of 1 week and then to to 400mg PO QD thereafter.
Her oral metoprolol and uptitrated and eventually her HR was controlled off IV agenrts.
Given little evidence for HIT and negative PF4 Ab on the advice of BMT she was started on enoxaparion at treatment dose 100mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-17**] with fXa level monitoring at which point her platelets were >50.
# Abdominal B cell lymphoma:  Diagnosed with pathology, cytology, and flow consistent with a B cell lymphoma.
She was started on CHOP therapy cycle one on [**2114-12-20**].
Patient was not receiving any prophylactic antimicrobials.
She had considerable mouth ulcers and these were treated effectively with lidocaine/Maalaox mouthwash.
On the recommendations of hematology, she was started on treatment dose enoxaparin 100mg [**Hospital1 **] with fXa level monitoring on [**1-17**] for her AF after her platelet count was >50.
Her first c difficile toxin was nagetive and  2ns was ...   She was treated initially with IV and then with po metronidazole and her WCC fell.
#Hypoxia:  Patient has history of underlying COPD lung disease of unknown severity and also had evidenec of effusions with atelectasis obn her initial CT imaging.
She improved with minimal O2 support.
O2 was weaned and she was treated with ipratropium and albuterol nebs.
She received a steroid taper as part of her AIH treatment.
# Pain control: Pt has a history of significant delirium with even small doses of opioids and family requested that pt not be given any narcotics.
There was no propr histopry in teh community of this as she had not been treated with opiates until her recent treatment at [**Hospital1 18**].
Pt has a known history of low pain tolerance and many pain complaints but only tylenol was used duringh her stay in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to patient and family preference.
She was presumptively treated with oral metronidazole from [**1-18**] given her loose stools and at the [**Last Name (un) 39762**] of writing, 1x c difficle toxin was negative and further sample is pending.
# Nutrition: Patient had poor po intake and had been on TPN in rehab for her poor nutritional status.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], her Alb was 2.7 (2.3 at lowest value) and given initial pain due to oral ulcers and concerns for starting TPN on a line inserted while bacteremia, TPN was initially held.
# Diabetes Type II: Pt has a history of DM II and received insulin treatment at home.
She initially required an IV insulin infusion and latterly when her steroids were tapered and no longer neutropenic, she was transitioned to [**Hospital1 **] NPH and HISS.
Latterly, her BGlc were well controlled following insulin added to her TPN.
# Autoimmune hepatitis: Patient received no further azathioprine in setting of neutropenia.
She was initially treated with stress dose steroids for her neutropenic sepsis and then a prednisone taper to conclude with 10mg each day x3 days; 5mg PO x3 days; 5mg PO QOD x4days then off.
Bilirubin was also elevated on admission at 3.0, rose to 6.1 and normalised to 1.0 by [**1-19**].
She was initially treated with an IV PPI and this was changed to oral ranitidine.
She was prescribed a First step mattress and had a wound care consult.
She required intubation by her second day in the ICU and could never be weaned.
Her fluid overload was so egregious that she began to develop weeping bullae on her extremities and abdomen, yet still required pressors and boluses in order to produce urine.
Significant loading of amiodarone was attempted, along with occasional IV pushes of diltiazem or metoprolol.
After it became clear that interventions could not improve her cardiac, pulmonary, or vascular conditions, the patient's family agreed to Comfort Measures only, including the removal of pressors.
Patient was on 6-week courseof vancomycin for MSSA bacteremia.
Patient was covered with broad antibiotics of Zyvox, meropenem, micafungin, and ciprofloxacin.
White count never dipped for long, and patient continued to require pressors until CMO instituted.
# Atrial fibrillation/flutter: Rate control was attempted with repeated loading doses of amiodarone after consultation with Cardiology.
Occasional IV pushes of metoprolol and diltiazem were also tried, with little success.
Attempts to wean off Levophed to vasopressin were unsuccessful.
Patient was placed on heparin drip as anticoagulation.
Patient rarely produing urine without substantial help from boluses and pressors.
