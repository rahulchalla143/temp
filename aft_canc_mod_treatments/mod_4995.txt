Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis.
Terminal ileum, resection (J-L): Acute and organizing serositis .
She had exp laparotomy on [**4-12**] where a perforated transverse colon was found; a R extended hemicolectomy and end ileostomy was performed, with L colon no longer in continuity with GI tract.
Given the concern for intraoperative spillage, she was started on Vancomycin, Zosyn and Fluconazole for planned five day course (day 1=[**4-12**]); this was broadened to Vancomycin, Meropenem, Ciprofloxacin and Fluconazole (day 1=[**4-16**]) when she was found to have developed a concomitant pneumonia.
Her pain was treated with a Dilaudid PCA and she was kept NPO with TPN post-surgery.
She was also continued on IV Bblocker and IV PPI post surgery.
The patient remained hypoxic after her surgery, with high supplemental oxygen need, thought to be due to splinting from abdominal pain as well as pneumonia; she was treated with antibiotics as above.
She initially had acute renal failure with poor urine output but this improved with volume resuscitation.
This patient has known metastatic ovarian cancer and was on weekly Avastin/Taxol prior to GI perforation.
She was given one dose of neupagen on [**4-13**] after surgery; this was stopped after discussing with Gyn/Onc.
Patient was transferred to the floor on [**2124-4-18**] after oxygen requirement was tapered to 6L.
Patient was diuresed with IV lasix and TPN was halved.
She was advanced from clear liquids to regular diet over the following two days with TPN discontinued.
3 staples were removed, cultures sent, and wound was packed.
Wound was monitored and anitbiotics continued.
Over the next several days, superior abdominal wound opened further with fascial dehiscence noted in wound and drainage of purulent fluid.
Wound was packed with aquacel and drainage decreased over time.
As wound improved, persistent leukocytosis raised concern for cdiff colitis.
Patient was started on empiric flagyl and a sigmoidoscopy was performed to assess remnant colon for pseudomembranes, with none seen.
Flagyl was stopped once 3 cdiff cultures were negative.
One dose of tizanidine was given and patient was overly sedated.
Tizanidine was not given and diazepam was stopped.
Scan was negative and patient's dyspnea was releived with nebulizer treatments and supplemental oxygen.
She worked with physical therapy and po intake was encourage.
