The patient was started on antibiotics for cellulitis.
The patient was treated with vancomycin and then a cephalosporin.
The patient was also maintained on Coreg and lisinopril as well as intermittent Lasix.
The patient was placed on dopamine and intravenous fluids.
The patient was then transferred here for possible aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement, and coronary artery bypass grafting.
Ventricular aneurysm in [**2150**]; status post surgical repair.
One-half normal saline with 40 of potassium chloride.
Vancomycin  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient's constitutional, ophthalmologic, ear/nose/throat, gastrointestinal, endocrine, hematologic, genitourinary, and musculoskeletal systems were all within normal limits.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Her temperature was 97.5, her blood pressure was 119/70, her heart rate was 90, and the patient was saturating at 97 percent on 2 liters by nasal cannula.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUES-SYSTEMS:  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed, and her central venous pressure transduced at 20 with a pulmonary artery pressure of 66/32.
Additionally, the patient was stable on minimal oxygen to stable on room air.
The patient was maintained on her Coreg and lisinopril.
Throughout her hospitalization, the patient received as needed Lasix intermittently.
She had a good response to intravenous Lasix, but diuresis was kept to a minimum given the patient's aortic stenosis.
Right right atrial mean was 29 mmHg.
There was approximately 43 mmHg peak, and 36 mm mean gradient across the aortic valve, and mildly diminished cardiac output, an index of 3.9 liters per minute, and 2.4 liters per minute m2; respectively, for a calculated valve area of approximately 0.6 cm2.
It was felt that given these findings that the patient would be a candidate for aortic valve replacement.
The case was discussed with Cardiothoracic Surgery, and it was felt that given the patient's active infection in the right foot that aortic valve replacement should be deferred until a later time after the patient has been on antibiotics for an adequate amount of time.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was initially maintained on vancomycin for a presumed right foot osteomyelitis.
The patient underwent x-rays of her right foot which revealed no fracture, evidence of bony destruction involving the head of the right first metatarsal consistent with osteitis.
Infectious Disease was consulted and they recommended oxacillin intravenously for osteomyelitis.
The length of antibiotics was discussed with Infectious Disease, and it was recommended that the patient would need at the very minimum six weeks of intravenous antibiotics following right foot debridement, and up to eight week total of intravenous oxacillin depending upon how the patient's right foot looked at follow-up appointments with both Podiatry and Infectious Disease.
Infectious Disease also stated that should an aortic valve replacement be necessitated prior to six weeks of intravenous antibiotics, at least two weeks of intravenous antibiotics are recommended and that the ptient should have surveillance blood cultures after this date, and if the patient's blood cultures are negative that the patient could then proceed with aortic valve replacement should it be necessitated before six weeks of antibiotics could be completed.
Given that the patient had good distal arterial flow, it was felt that the patient would not need stenting at this time.
FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on a 2-gram cardiac diet as well as a diabetic diet.
PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on subcutaneous heparin and a bowel regimen.
Prior to discharge, the patient had a peripherally inserted central catheter line placed for the purpose of extended intravenous antibiotics.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was to take all medications as prescribed.
It was requested that the outside facility follow her liver function tests while the patient was on oxacillin for right osteomyelitis.
MAJOR SURGICAL-INVASIVE PROCEDURES PERFORMED:  Status post pulmonary catheter placement.
Status post cardiac catheterization.
Status post right foot debridement [**2158-6-11**].
