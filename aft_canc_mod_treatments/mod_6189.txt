Patient was admitted from [**Date range (1) 56895**]/11 for evaluation of hemoptysis.
He underwent bronchoscopy and was found to have diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
Ultimately was discharged home to complete a course of levofloxacin and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (primary oncologist), with DAH attributed to being give heparin (for presumed PE in ED) in setting of hemoptysis.
Given his respiratory distress, patient opted for intubation; was intubated with rocuronium and etomidate.
Was then given propofol and fentanyl.
Also received labetalol 10 mg for hypertension 213/102 with heart rates in the 120s.

Continued medical management 3.
Euvolemia   Brief Hospital Course: 65 year-old male with multiple myeloma s/p autologous stem cell transplant ([**2149**]) and amyloidosis, ESRD on HD with recent admission for DAH of unknown etiology admitted to MICU [**2151-2-23**] with hemoptysis.
In the MICU ([**Date range (1) 80980**]), patient was intubated for airway protection (extubated [**2151-2-27**]).
Nicardipine drip was initiated for blood pressure control/afterload reduction; he was subsequently transitioned back to home blood pressure regimen.
For evaluation of hypokinetic LV papillary muscle (without rupture) with surrounding normal myocardium, he was initially planned for cardiac MRI to assess for amyloidosis - given risk of NSF on ESRD, this was not done.
He was transferred to cardiology service on [**2151-3-3**] for further management with a plan for afterload reduction to reduce degree of MR and thereby negate the need for urgent surgery.
Carvedilol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] was added to his blood pressure regimen.
Given the need for agressive afterload reduction, and his demonstrated HTN while on HD despite significant volume reduction his BP meds should be given prior to HD each morning.
