Admission Date:  [**2155-9-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2155-9-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-6-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: aspirin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**] Chief Complaint: Fevers, leukocytosis, tachycardia   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Ultrasound-guided percutaneous cholecystostomy with catheter placment   History of Present Illness: 54yo female with T-cell lymphoma transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital with diagnosis of presumed cholecystitis.
She was started on vancomycin and cefepime.
She was additionally found to have elevated LFTs with Tbili 2.4, Dbili 2.2, ALT initially 188, AST 130, increasing to 245 on day of transfer.
Given the LFT abnormalities she had an abdominal ultrasound, which showed gallbladder wall thickening, distention of gallbladder and multiple 10mm mobile gallstones, trace pericholecystic fluid, but no CBD dilatation (4mm).
On exam she had a positive [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign was tachycardic and initially borderline hypotensive (unclear exact pressures), however, received fluid resuscitation with an unclear amount of fluid and blood pressures responded, by report systolics in the low 100s (105/68) upon transfer, HR 140s regular sinus tach, RR 20, 95% on RA.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations.
Limited tissue, a clear diagnosis was not possible but pathology was consistent with Hodgkin lymphoma.
Given rapid progression of symptoms, a second biopsy was performed on the neck lymph node and she was started on treatment with steroids and ABVD.
Chemo was changed for her second cycle to CHOEP.
[**2155-7-28**]: ICE cycle #1.
[**2155-8-18**]: ICE cycle #2. .
PMH: - Colon cancer s/p right hemicolectomy [**2153**].
PSX: - Hemicolectomy as above.
She also developed respiratory failure and was intubated and ventilated.
She underwent ultrasound guided cholecystoscopy and catheter placement, however her lactate continued to increase and the patient continued to clinically decompensate.
Her family was made aware, and decided to pursue DNR code status with comfort measures only.
Patient was taken off pressors and antibiotics and was extubated.
Patient underwent ultrasound guided cholecystostomy with catheter placement, as she was not stable enough to undergo cholecystectomy.
Despite intervention and broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with meropenem and zosyn, patient's lactate continued to trend up to a peak of 15 and she continued to be tachycardic, hypotensive, and acidotic despite optimizing ventilator settings.
In light of clinical decompensation, the family decided to make the patient DNR, with comfort measures only.
Therefore she was extubated and pressors and antibiotics were stopped.
She was made comfortable with morphine drip until she expired.
Patient's oxygenation was maintained on the ventilator, but she continued to be acidotic despite maximizing her settings.
Acidosis could not be corrected despite optimizing vent settings and patient was subsequently extubated per family's wishes as mentioned above.
Baseline at last check ALT 47, AST 22, Tbili 0.5.
Patient underwent ultrasound guided cholecystostomy, however her lactate continued to trend up and she continued to be septic.
Further intervention and antibiotics were withheld when the patient was made comfort measures only.
This is likely to be related to chemotherapy or anemia of chronic inflammation in setting of cancer.
Follow up: N/A  Medications on Admission: Zosyn 3.375 gram q6h Acyclovir 400mg PO BID (prophylaxis) Bactrim SS one PO daily (prophylaxis) Advair 250/50 one inhalation daily Zofran 4mg q6h PRN nausea Acetaminophen 1000mg q6h PRN fever   Discharge Medications: None  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Septic Shock Respiratory failure  Secondary: Acute cholecystitis   Discharge Condition: Expired  Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 11084**],  It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 18**].
We supported you with antibiotics, and medications to help with your blood pressure.
