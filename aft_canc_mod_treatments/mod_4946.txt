She re-presented to [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 **] ER on [**11-23**] with chills, severe confusion, Temp 101.5 and HR 109.
She was admittted for SIRS and given broad ABX with Vancomycin and Zosyn.
She was switched to Penicillin since the original organism had sensitivity to this.
On [**11-27**] she had fever [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] Vancomycin was continued (no significant time had passed where it was actually stopped from before).
She was thought to be fluid overloaded and was given lasix 40mg IV as well as 2 units of PRBCs for an Hct of 25.
A rapid response was called, and with IV lopressor and Ativan, her HR improved.
Per D/C summary, blood cultures from [**11-30**] had 2/4 bottles positive for Strep viridans and Zosyn was discontinued.
On [**12-1**] she had a PICC placed in anticipation of having her port pulled.
ABX were not changed from Vancomycin and PCN from [**11-26**] until [**12-4**] when both were stopped.
The patient received one dose of Imipenam before transfer on [**12-4**] since Blood culture on [**12-1**] had one out of four positive for Klebsiella which was sensitive to Imipenam.
She started chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin on [**2197-2-27**].
In the setting of pain, she was referred for CyberKnife therapy which was completed on [**2197-7-4**] after initial course was complicated by intercurrent biliary obstruction requiring hospitalization and stenting.

Chest x-ray [**2197-12-5**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a right Port-A-Cath.
The patient also has received a left PICC line.
Pneumobilia, expected within context of biliary stenting and recent ERCP.
A metal stent was seen at ampulla.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a balloon catheter using a free-hand technique.
Large amount of sludge, debris and pus were extracted successfully using a 12 mm balloon.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 87852**] is a 64-year-old female with history of HTN, metastatic breast cancer and active biliary cancer on chemotherapy who is transferred from [**Hospital3 **] hospital with fever and bacteremia.
The patient was initially treated with Vancomycin/Zosyn and then vanc/penicillin but continued to [**Hospital3 **] temps.
This was likely in part due to her intermediate sensitivity to antibiotics.
Prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she was given Imipenem and was afebrile.
In the ICU, Pt's antibiotics were continued.
She did not require pressors and received fluid resuscitation.
Her chemo port was surgically removed on [**12-6**], which she tolerated well.
The patient did not receive IV gadolinium because she became nauseated and did not tolerate the rest of the exam.
This was discussed with the infectious disease service, who felt at that time, aspirating the lesions would not change treatment given her proven bacteremia.
Patient has biliary stent placed in 8/[**2196**].
Other options would be percutaneous biliary drain for decompression vs. ERCP to extend the stent.
Decision was made to have a percutaneous biliary drain placed for decompression.
She went for the procedure on [**2197-12-19**].
Pain and anxiety medications were uptitrated and started on labetalol and nitro.
Patient's micro data showed [**Female First Name (un) **] in her bile, sputum, and urine cultures.
Empirically started on micafungin, but then narrowed to fluconzole as the species was presumed [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.
Also grew Enterobactor cloacae in her bile and patient was continued on meropenem.
Pain has been an ongoing issue, but the patient is now on morphine PCA and PO methadone which has been sufficient.
She was taking IV morphine prn and IV methadone standing.
The patient had SBP up to 190s requiring labetalol which she responded well to initially.
An EKG showed questionable a fib vs a flutter and we started to use IV lopressor to bring down her blood pressure which she tolerated well.
She will be discharged with a foley in place, as her mental status comes and goes, and the foley is not currently bothering her.
She was receiving IV meropenem for blood and abscess cultures growing enterobacter, but will leave on PO levaquin.
She was also started on a nystatin cream for a rash on her RLQ and R upper thigh.
She will also leave on PO fluconazole.
