For details of the operation, see procedure note.
Preoperatively, the patient had an epidural line placed and a foley catheter and 2 chest tubes placed intraoperatively.
His primary issue in the immediate post-op period was pressure support for which he was placed on a neosynephrine drip-stopped prior to going to the floor.
Due to his BP issues, his epidural was removed on POD#1 and a PCA was installed for pain control.
On POD#2, the patient went into atrial fibrillation and was treated with 2g of IV magnesium sulfate, fluid boluses, 150cc amiodarone bolus x2, calcium chloride, diltiazem and was then moved to the critical care unit for BP monitoring.
At that time he was started on a diltiazem drip.

On POD#4, the chest tubes and foley catheter were removed.
Also, the patient was started on a Heparin drip and coumadin 5mg QHS for anticoagulation secondary to the atrial fibrillation.
EPS was consulted at that time and recommended maintaining amiodarone at 800mg/day for 1 week, 400 mg/day 2 weeks thereafter and finally 200mg/day to finish.
Also, the diltiazem drip was subsequently discontinued that day.
