It was stated that due to the complex nature of this case, two attendings were present for the case involving Open partial nephrectomy from the transplanted kidney.
The tumor was excised, and JP drain was placed.
He was taken back to the OR on [**2101-5-24**] again with Drs' [**Name5 (PTitle) 816**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 3748**] for Exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions and freeing up obstruction.

He was switched to Ampicillin on [**2101-5-27**] and this was continued for 9 days.
In addition he received Levaquin for a total of 11 days.
The patient was started on TPN via a PICC line, this was continued for about two weeks.
PICC line was d/c'd prior to his discharge.
The cultures were negative x 5, however he was started on PO Vanco as his WBC remained elevated, and no other source was identified.
He was chemically converted on Amiodarone and was started on a heparin drip.
Due to the interaction between amiodarone, Prograf and Coumadin, the patient was started on half dose Coumadin on [**6-3**].
The anticoagulation was stopped and he received 3 units of pRBC's.
The heparin drip and coumadin were placed on hold.
The amiodarone was discontinued and it was decided to rate control the patient which was well achieved with beta blockade.
The coumadin was restarted at an even lower dose, as well, the heparin remained off and he was started on Lovenox injection, which he will be continuing at home short term.
