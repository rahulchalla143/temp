# Hypoxia/SOB: These symptoms today were in the setting of not using oxygen for 2 hours, otherwise pt states that her cough was improving and she denies having any fevers.
So this is less like to be due to pneumonia, although it is possible that she could develop a post-obstructive pneumonia given her anatomy and tumor burden.
She remained stable in-house on her home O2 requirement of 2L nasal cannula.
She was continued on her home Advair diskus and provided symptomatic relief with tessalon perrles and codeine-guaifenescin PRN.
On review of the CTA, it was felt that the patient would likely not benefit from stenting and thus Interventional Pulmonary were not called in-house.
As the patient responded well symptomatically to low-dose ativan, she was given a prescription for this upon discharge, to help with anxiety and air hunger.
