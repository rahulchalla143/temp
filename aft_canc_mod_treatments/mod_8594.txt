The patient also denies nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fevers, or chills.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is afebrile with a temperature of 98.1, heartrate 105, blood pressure 110/76, respiratory rate 26, and oxygen saturation 88% on room air, increasing to 93% on 3 liters by nasal cannula.
Pulmonary - The patient was anticoagulated with heparin for his pulmonary embolus.
The decision was made to pursue pulmonary embolectomy by Interventional Radiology.
This was performed on [**2155-10-15**], after which the patient remained intubated in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
He developed acute onset hypertension, followed by hypotension and tachycardia requiring pressors and fluids.
On [**2155-10-26**] the patient self-extubated and was able to maintain oxygen saturations greater than 93% on a 100% nonrebreather mask.
Cardiovascular - Initially the patient was rate-controlled with a beta blocker.
Status post intubation, the patient required intravenous pressors to maintain blood pressures as previously noted.
The patient was quickly weaned off of pressors in several days and maintained hemodynamic stability throughout his hospitalization at the time of this dictation.
Hematology - Anticoagulation was maintained with heparin, and the patient was switched to oral Coumadin with therapeutic INR maintained for three days prior to discontinuation of heparin.
Infectious disease - The patient's pneumonia was treated with a variety of antibiotics, including Augmentin, Levofloxacin, Zosyn and Vancomycin.
The patient was switched from Ceftriaxone to Levofloxacin as he was transitioned to oral medications and he continued to improve.
Lasix was used to continue diuresis and his creatinine did not increase above 1.0 at any time.
His narcotic and sedative medications were restricted, and psychiatric evaluation found the patient to be incompetent to make medical decisions.
At the time of this dictation, the patient still had episodes of delirium and confusion requiring a 1:1 sitter for safety.
