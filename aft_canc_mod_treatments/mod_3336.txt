Intra-abdominal drain placement, then removal on [**2193-2-22**]   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 63-year-old female with past medical history significant for  atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, asthma, hypertension, diet-controlled type II diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction with PCI (RCA stent in [**2192-5-17**]), status-post CABG x1 ([**2192-7-31**])and a history of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia with allogenic bone marrow transplant done [**3-/2191**], on regular low dose steroids for GVHD of the skin s/p BMT, who presented on [**2193-1-19**] complaining of [**1-18**] days of "crampy" lower abdominal pains.
Of relevance, Mrs. [**Known lastname **]  has known diverticulosis which was identified on a colonoscopy about four years ago.
Due to her severe abdominal cramping and pains, she was initially observed in the ICU setting with the intention to manage her conservatively with medications and supportive therapy as she was felt to be a poor surgical candidate given her previous cancer and cardiac history and being on ASA and Plavix on admission.

[**2193-1-23**] CXR : New right picc line with tip in proximal svc.
A moderate-sized pneumoperitoneum is enlarged since [**1-19**].
Note is made of a gallstone within an otherwise unremarkable gallbladder, unchanged.
A Foley catheter is seen within an otherwise normal urinary bladder.
However, new focal opacities, to a much lesser extent than previous, are seen within the right upper lobe in the azygoesophageal recess and along the medial anterior right lower lobe abutting the fissure and mediastinum (5:180).
A new right main coronary artery stent has been placed.
The left PICC line tip is at the junction of brachiocephalic vein and SVC.
Large, likely multiloculated fluid collection extending from the pelvis adjacent to the surgical chain sutures into the lower left abdomen.
[**2193-2-10**] CT-GUIDED PELVIC ABSCESS DRAINAGE HISTORY: 63-year-old patient with colostomy for perforated diverticulitis.
Catheter drainage of the abscess was requested.
PROCEDURE: Procedure and its complications were explained.
Laboratory values checked, INR was initially elevated, fresh frozen plasma was used to lower this to 1.5.
The patient is also on aspirin and Plavix, which could not be discontinued because of the cardiac considerations.
1% lidocaine used for local anesthetic.
Conscious sedation was also used.
Patient tolerated the procedure well.
CONCLUSION: Successful placement of 10 French pigtail catheter in the left pericolic abscess.
Slight interval decrease in size of a left flank and pelvic collection with pigtail catheter in place in unchanged position.
Diverting colonostomy with diverticulosis of the most distal segment of bowel and mild wall thickening, but no evidence of obstruction.
The degree of dilation of the collecting systems can be assessed with ultrasound if clinically indicated.
Log-In Date/Time: [**2193-2-10**] 4:34 pm       ABSCESS LEFT PARACOLIC GUTTER.S/P SURGERY FOR DIVERTICULITIS.
The patient was considered a high-risk operative candidate due to her cardiac and cancer history, and her pain was focal and isolated to her right lower quadrent, and thus initially received conservative treatment.
She was started on Zosyn early on in her hospital course.
Though she initially responded quite well to the IV antibiotics with significant improvement in her abdominal pain for the first [**2-19**] days, he patient's abdominal pain & overall appearance worsened on hospital day #4, and it was clear that she needed to be taken to the operating room for a exploratory laparotomy.
She was given FFP, Vitamoin K to correct her INR of 8, and 1 unit of PRBC and taken to the operating room.
She underwent surgery for a perforated diverticulum including a sigmoidectomy, hartmann?????
?s pouch, and colostomy with a plan for anastamosis in the future.
Her operative course was relatively uncomplicated, she did have some intra-op bleeding which was managed with cautery and FFP.
Her post-op course was later complicated by fever after being taken off Zosyn (her zosyn was continued post operatively for PNA treatment).
On CT of the abdomen she was found to have loculated fluid collections which required post-operative IR drainage and a JP drain was left in place.
She then had to go for repeat IR drainage to help break up the loculations.
For enteric broad coverage she was started on Zosyn, Vancomycin, Caspofungin, and Gentamicin and her abdominal fluid grew pseudomonas which was fortunately sensitive to multiple agents.
As she continued to recover steadily she was gradually taken off of Vancomycin, Caspofungin and Gentamicin but continued on Zosyn.
After this reassuring CT study the surgical team removed her one remaining JP drain on her left abdomen.
Colostomy site and prior JP entry site were clean, dry, non-edematous, non-erythematous and in tact at time of discharge.
She was set-up with home line care services for her PICC line and she was also set up for additional home VNA services at time of discharge.
A repeat CT was set-up a few days prior to this appointment to allow for final review for any recurrent abscesses or collections prior to final removal of PICC and antibiotic discontinuance.
A vitamin B12 deficiency was also diagnosed during her initial Heme/Oncology work-up.
She was admitted [**2-/2191**] for induction chemotherapy with 7+3 cytarabine and idarubicin, which she tolerated well.
She underwent allogeneic transplantation from an HLA matched sibling donor with pentostatin/TBI in [**2191-3-17**].
At time of this current admission she had been doing well from an oncologic standpoint and she was on 3mg daily Prednisone, and a prophylactic dose of acyclovir 400mg PO TID.
During this admission she was given her inhaled pentamidine on [**2193-2-5**].
As aforementioned she had a vitamin B12 deficiency recognized back in [**2190**] during her initial referral visits to the hematology/oncology service for pancytopenia.
She did require blood transfusions during her hospitalization both peri-operatively and after her IR drainage.
Per surgical team notes she ahd been placed on Zosyn prior to her surgery and after being diagnosed with probable RUL PNA her therapy was prolonged per ID recommendations, particularly  given her additional abdominal collections (alongside Gentamicin).
She was placed on albuterol nebulizers and inhalers which she continued to use with decreasing frequency as her breathing came back to baseline.
Given her PMH of mild asthma she was discharged to continue her usual home albuterol inhaler on an as-needed basis and to notify her doctor if she had any additional fevers, productive cough or recurrent dyspnea.
She was continued on her usual Plavix, aspirin, and atorvastatin therapy.
#Hypertension: Metoprolol dose was decreased to metoprolol tartrate 12.5 [**Hospital1 **] as her blood pressure well controlled on this regimen and she was bradycardic at night when on a higher dose.
# Atrial fibrillation: Mrs.[**Initials (NamePattern4) 24712**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 34306**] and post-operative course were complicated by atrial fibrillation.
Before her laparotomy, she was evaluated by cardiology and her coumadin therapy she had been taking for her known atrial fibrillation was discontinued for the procedure.
She had some rapid bouts of atrial fibrillation on [**2193-1-22**] which required a diltiazem drip for control.
Post-surgery she was monitored with serial EKGs, and continuous telemetry and she was eventually converted back to NSR with Amiodarone therapy.
She was restarted on warfarin after her surgery and she continued metoprolol.
After discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] her warfarin was discontinued and she had her dose of Amiodarone tapered prior to discharge.
She will see discuss length of her treatment and further dose adjustments at her upcoming cardiology follow-up appointment.
# Hypotension: She experienced hypotension preoperatively that required fluid boluses.
Post operatively her hypotensive episodes were attributed to the combination of getting metoprolol and lasix per the surgical service notes.
By time of discharge she was near to her usual baseline and she was not placed on any additional diuretics at discharge.
# GERD: She has a history of gastroesophageal reflux and she was continued on her usual famotidine medication for GI protection and relief during her stay.
She was placed on an additional insulin sliding scale for tight control in the peri-operative setting and while in the hospital.
# Insomnia: She had some mild complaints of occasional insomnia during her hospital course which was effectively relieved with lorazepam 0.5 mg PO HS:PRN.
# Nutrition /electrolytes: She required TPN post-operatively but was then transitioned to a regular diabetic diet which she tolerated very well.
No issues with colostomy training and care.

You went into an abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation but you were converted back to a normal rhythm with a medication called amiodarone.
You required high dose steroids while you were in the hospital but are now on your regular home dose of prednisone.
You also had a pneumonia, respiratory virus, and a later abdominal abscess and you were treated with an antibiotic called Zosyn.
When you had some respiratory infections you had some additional shortness of breath which was relieved with supplemental oxygen, but you were gradually taken off of this once you were no longer short of breath.
You also received inhaled pentamidine therapy during your stay.
Please continue an additional 18 days of your Zosyn, until your next follow-up appointments on [**3-12**] with your surgeon and your oncologist.
