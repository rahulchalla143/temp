He received his carboplatin and taxol and went home where he developed watery diarrhea, weakness, and, per his wife, some element of confusion.
He then became hypotensive to the 70s so he was given IV fluids (2L NS total) and started on phenylephrine gtt.
He was started on vancomycin and cefepime in the ED.
Given elevated troponin and concern for PE, he was started on a heparin gtt.
FDG-avid mass-like consolidation throughout the right lower lobe and FDG-avid right supraclavicular, hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy.
Markedly increased FDG-avidity in the region of the dorsum sellae without anatomic correlate, though only partially assessed, MRI is recommended for further evaluation.
-carboplatin/taxol started [**2133-12-31**], on concurrent XRT  Social History: Lives in [**Location 4310**] with his wife.
Vitals: HR- 104, BP- 110/63, RR- 25, SaO2- 99% on 5L NC General: No acute distress, obese HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, NC in place Neck: supple, no LAD, difficult to assess JVD Lungs: Diffuse wheezes throughout, bibasilar crackles, good respiratory effort.

[**2134-1-22**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST - No evidence of mass or mass effect in the brain, however, evaluation of the mass is limited due to lack of IV contrast.
Upper zone redistribution and mild pulmonary vascular plethora is present, but is likely accentuated by low lung volumes.
Brief Hospital Course: IMPRESSION: 77M with a PMH significant for COPD, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus type 2 and recent diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma (stage IIIB, T2b N3 MX, last dose of carboplatin and taxol on [**2134-1-21**]) admitted with hypoxia and hypotension, found to have an elevated D-dimer and cardiac biomarker elevation with concern for acute pulmonary embolization.
# ACUTE HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE - Patient presented with desaturation to the 70s requiring NRB for oxygenation support.
Known primary RLL lung adenocarcinoma undergoing treatment with chemotherapy.
A CXR showed some opacification at the right and left lung base which could represent early consolidation given his immunecompromise and healthcare exposure.
ACS/MI was considered but deemed less likely given his reassuring EKG and no strong evidence of cardiac history, despite his cardiac biomarker elevation.
He was treated with IV/PO steroids with some improvement in his oxygen requirement.
Overall, with heparinization for his suspected pulmonary embolus and treatment of pneumonia with broad spectrum antibiotics as well as steroids for a component of COPD, his pulmonary status improved and we weaned his supplemental oxygen needs.
# HYPOTENSION - Presented with SBP to the 80s in the ED with Neosynephrine gtt started.
He was started on Levophed given persistent hypotension.
Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Cefepime were begun on admission for empiric HCAP coverage in this oncology patient as another potentional source of hypotension.
Following antibiosis, steroids and supplemental oxygen, his pressor requirement was weaned.
We held his anti-hypertensive medications on discharge.
His tachycardia improved with hepariniztion, antibiosis and steroid treatments.
His medications were renally dosed.
# OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA - Patient with diagnosis of OSA but does not tolerate CPAP at home.
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS - [**Name (NI) **] wife said patient not at baseline since following his chemotherapy on [**2134-1-21**].
# LUNG ADENOCARCINOMA - Stage IIIB (T2b N3 MX) currently receiving infusions of carboplatin and taxol, last dose received [**2134-1-21**].
Discussed with outpatient Oncologist and chemotherapy remained on hold given his acute clinical needs.
He continued radiation therapy that was started as an out patient while hospitalized.
# DIABETES MELLITUS, TYPE 2 - Patient on glimeperide at home without insulin requirement.
Maintained on insulin sliding scale this admission.
# HYPERTENSION - On Lisinopril, HCTZ per home medication dosing; will hold anti-hypertensives in the setting of hypotension and renal failure.
TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES: 1.Lovenox should be continued for 3-6mos for treatment of PE.
2.Pt will need to continue daily treatments of radiation therapy.
He has a follow up appt with his oncologist to restart chemo   Medications on Admission: Ondansetron 8mg q8hr prn nausea Prochlorperazine maleate 10mg q6hr prn nausea lorazepam 1mg- [**11-23**] tab q30min before brain MRI Glimepiride 1mg PO daily with breakfast Simvastatin 40mg PO daily Lisinopril 40mg daily HCTZ 25mg daily (on hold) Beclomethasone dipropionate 40mcg inhaler- 1 inh [**Hospital1 **] (not taking as prescribed) Albuterol inh- 1-2puff q4-6 hr prn (not taking as prescribed) Fluticasone 50mcg- 1 spray per nostril daily  Discharge Medications: 1. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath, wheeze.
