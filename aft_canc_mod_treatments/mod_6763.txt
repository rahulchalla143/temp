C1-C2 posterior spinal decompression, transpedicular.
He was felt to have torticollis and was discharged with flexeril and percocet.
His daughter called his PCP at which point they attributed his symptoms to the medication changes and percocet/flexeril was discontinued.
He was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response w/HR of 160; it is unclear what medications were changed at this time.
He was started on clindamycin for an intended 10 day course.
INR was 6.1 on admission and coumadin was held.

The previously noted fluid collection and abnormal enhancement at the craniocervical junction is not clearly identified, please refer to the dedicated MRI of the cervical spine and neck for details.
Lytic lesion within the dens and C2 vertebral body, with partial destruction of the anterior and posterior cortices.
Otherwise, its appearance would also be compatible with a metastasis.
Video Oropharyngeal Swallow ([**5-23**]): Aspiration all liquids.
Video Oropharyngeal Swallow ([**5-30**]): Improvement but onoing severe dyphagia with aspiration of thin liquids.
Clears for sips of nectar thick liquids with observation.
Patient was continued on his IV Clindamycin (Day 1 [**2108-5-16**]) and was started on IV Ceftriaxone on [**2108-5-20**].
Orthopedic spine was consulted and recommended conservative management with continuing IV antibiotics given that surgery would carry a significant morbidity (an anterior approach with posterior fusion).
Patient's family was informed of the difficulties of surgery and agreed with the plan for conservative management for the time being.
Orthopedic spine decided to schedule surgery for [**5-25**] given no resolution of abscess after conservative management.
The patient's daughter was [**Name2 (NI) 82414**] ([**Name (NI) **]) and was at the patient's bedside for assistance with consent for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 282**], and surgical procedure.
Patient was taken to the OR on [**5-24**] for emergent decompressive surgery.
Pus was drained from the C2 site, but no hardware was placed due to risk of infection.
Patient also had a PICC line and [**Month/Year (2) 282**] placed at the time of surgery.
On [**5-30**], infectious disease recommended discontinuing clindamycin and ceftriaxone, and transitioning to ceftriaxone and flagyl given the patient developed diarrhea on [**5-30**].
-- Patient will continue antibiotics to complete a 6 week course, last day [**2108-7-6**].
Infectious disease was consulted and recommended continuing the IV Clindamycin (started on [**5-16**] in [**Hospital 1263**] hospital) for anaerobic coverage, given the positive [**Hospital **] cultures for Veilonella from the [**Hospital 1263**] hospital.
Ceftriaxone was started on [**5-20**] to for polymicrobial coverage.
[**Hospital 1263**] hospital was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding sensitivies of the organism, but the microbiology laboratory reported that sensivities are not performed on anaerobic organisms.
Antibiotics are as above --  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 438**] is the ID specialist caring for this patient.
Patient tolerated crush meds well.
On [**5-23**], the video swallow was obtained and showed severe oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin and nectar thick liquids.
Surgery was consulted for [**Month/Year (2) 282**] placement, given patient's failed swallow test and expected prolonged course (requiring hard collar for [**6-11**] wks) following orthopedic spine surgery.
Surgery consented the patient with patient's daughter at bedside, and performed the [**Month/Day (3) 282**] placement during the emergent orthopedic spine surgery on [**5-24**].
Nutriton was consulted and initated tube feeds with no complications.
Speech and swallow evaluated the patient after surgery on [**5-29**].
Speech and swallow recommended continuing G-tube feeds as primary source of nutrition, with supervised pleasure feeds of small amounts of nectar thick liquids per sitting.
-- Continue G-tube feeds as primary means of nutrition, hydration, and medications.
-- Initiate supervised pleasure feeds of small amounts of nectar thick liquids per sitting.
-- Repeat instrumental evaluation at rehab prior to upgrading diet and once patient has cervical collar removed to further assess swallow function and effectiveness of treatment techniques.
-- Ongoing assessment of tube feeding requirements and electrolytes needs by nutrition.
His home medications of digoxin and diltiazem were continued.
Orthopedic spine recommended holding any anti-coagulation or antithrombotics pending decision on need for surgical intervention.
His digoxin was discontinued and patient was started on lopressor, which improved his heart rate control.
He received 2 mg Vitamin K on [**5-23**] and 2 units FFP prior to his surgery.
Post-operatively the patient was reinitiated on his anticoagulation on [**5-28**] at reduced dose of 3 mg (home dose 5mg).
Patient's heart rate remained borderline tachycardic, and increased with exertion, and thus his lopressor was uptitrated to 50 mg PO TID.
His home dose of enalapril was increased to 40 mg Qdaily, with improvement in his [**Hospital1 **] pressure recordings.
Patient was noted to be hypertensive again on [**5-23**] with systolic in the 160s, and his lopressor was up-titrated.
Patient tolerated his oral [**Month/Year (2) **] pressure medications crushed, and his [**Month/Year (2) **] presure was stable in the 160s.
Patient underwent emergent decompressive surgery later on [**5-24**].
Following surgery, patient had a foley catheter that was discontinued on [**5-28**].
Patient was initially managed with scheduled urinations every 4 hours, which did not improve his incontinence.
Due to risk of skin breakdown and continued incontinence, a foley was placed on [**5-30**].
-- Plan for foley removal q3 days with scheduled voids, if this does not work either condom catheter or re-insertion of foley.
-- If issue persists patient should see urology for further evaluation.
Diabetes - Metformin was held and an insulin sliding scale was started.
Following surgery and initiation of tube feeds, patient's [**Hospital1 **] glucose levels rose into the 200s.
Patient was started on 2 units lantus in addition to his insulin sliding scale, with significantly improved glucose control.
-- Continue lantus 2units and HISS with adjustment to dosing as indicated.
The acute onset of diarrhea in a patient on Clindamycin and Ceftriaxone was concerning for C.difficile infection.
ID determined that patient would be best served on ceftriaxone, flagyl to complete antibiotic course for veillonella.
Patient is likely at increased risk for loose stools due to tube feeds.
-- Ongoing monitoring of stool frequency, reinitiation of bowel regimen if indicated  8.
Gout/Knee pain - Home dose of colchine was continued until patient went to OR [**5-24**].
After patient developed diarrhea on [**5-29**], the colchicine was discontinued given possible contribution to loose bowel movements.
Given his history of bacteremia, there was a concern for septic arthritis and thus knee arthrocentesis was attempted.
Colchicine was held given the ongoing diarrhea, and pain was managed with Ibuprofen 600 mg Q8H.
