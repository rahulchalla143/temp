We gave you IV fluids, improved your pain control, and your condition improved.
We made the following changes to your medications: (1) We started Tylenol to be taken three times per day for pain (2) We started oxycodone 2.5 mg every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain -> this medication can be constipating so it is important to take stool softeners -> We started Colace and Senna (3) We started Zofran 4 mg to be taken every 8 hours as needed for nausea (4) Started pantoprazole which helps protect you for further bleeding from your stomach.
(5) Started lidocaine patch for pain control.
(6) Stopped your aspirin - you should not restart this until your primary care doctor says you should restart it, because this increases your risk for GI bleeding.
