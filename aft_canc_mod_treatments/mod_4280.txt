Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 1349**] is a 60y/o gentleman with EtOH and HCV cirrhosis complicated by ascites, varices, HCC s/p TACE [**12/2121**] who is transferred from an OSH with continued encephalopathy, GI bleed, and fevers.
Acute onset of depressed level of consciousness at home could represent hepatic encophalopathy.
Has been taking Lactulose QID but no report of if he has been stooling.
Precipitants could include upper GI bleed, medication effect (was on a Versed drip at OSH for ~36h), or infection (see "fevers" below).
Switched to bolus sedation and continued lactulose and rifaximin without improvement of mental status.
Initial plan was for colonoscopy but goals of care were discussed with family and as it was felt that this was a nonintervenable source of bleeding, supportive transfusions were discontinued and no further interventions were undertaken.
PPI and octreotide drips were continued and patient was transitioned to CMO.
He was covered with Zosyn and Flagyl which were discontinued on HD #2 as there was no clear source of infection.
HCV and EtOH cirrhosis: No response to lactulose and rifaximin so these were discontinued.
His lasix and spironolactone were held.
# Code Status: Given patient's persistent absence of mental status improvement, his poor prognosis given his underlying HCC and ongoing GI bleed, patient was made CMO on HD #2.
