Endotracheal tube tip about 4 cm above the carina.
If clinically indicated, a focused study with contrast administration may allow for evaluation for intracardiac shunt.
Using a micropuncture set and modified Seldinger technique, a 6 French sheath was advanced into the right common femoral artery.
The decision was made to pursue intra-arterial thrombolysis with Merci clot retrieval device.
A new retrieval device was then used for another pass.
We therefore decided to stop the procedure as more than 6 hours had elapsed since the onset of symptoms and the patient had a demonstrable infarct on his preprocedure CT scan.
The sheath was left with continuous flush to be removed later.
A neurologic examination could not be performed immediately due to deep sedation and muscle relaxants.
Based on the diagnostic findings, it was decided to proceed with TPA and clot retrieval.
IMPRESSION: Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 100404**] underwent cerebral arteriography and emergent intra-arterial thrombolysis with Merci clot retrieval device and TPA.
At the end of the procedure there was significant occlusion of the M2 division secondary to completed infarct of the left MCA superior division territory.

[**11-19**] EEG: L temporal slowing   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 100404**] was intubated for airway protection and taken for IA tPA and MERCI clot retrieval (as detailed above).
He was continued on his Atovastatin and was found to have an excellent lipid panel.
He was not initially started on anticoagulation given the tPA and the extent of the lesion however he was gradually restarted on coumadin.
Regarding his stroke workup, his cardiac rhythm was noted to be atrial fibrillation, and he was started on a heparin drip as well as coumadin (held for G-tube placement).
His blood sugars in the hospital were within normal limits for the most part, and no new diabetes medication regimen was initiated apart from a standard insulin sliding scale (requiring no doses of insulin on this).
Total cholesterol was 130, HDL was 42, trig 125 and LDL was 63; his dose of Lipitor was thus not changed.
The patient worked with speech, physical and occupational therapy, who recommended rehab placement.
His urologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25443**] (at [**Hospital1 112**]) was [**Name (NI) 653**], and he recommended follow-up with MRI over the next several months, with consideration for percutaneous cryotherapy.
No further workup of this mass was recommended, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25443**] felt that G-Tube placement should be safe.
"Code purple" was called four times, requiring security and emergent psychiatry evaluation.
Zyprexa was titrated up, then slightly decreased to current dose given somnolence in the morning on [**11-19**].
At the time of discharge, he did not require a sitter and was less agitated and more awake and interactive, as well as cooperative with daily examinations.
3) The patient underwent GJ tube placement by IR; he pulled this out slightly during one period of agitation.
On the morning of discharge, tiny blood clots were seen upon aspirating gastric contents.
He was placed on a three-day course of cipro and a larger foley was placed to tamponade the area of trauma.
Frequent (q2 h) flushes were recommended.
No seizure medications were started.
