Admission Date:  [**2199-12-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-12-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2120-4-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Pneumococcal Vaccine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**] Chief Complaint: hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p bronchial artery embolization   History of Present Illness: 79-year-old male with history of NSCLC s/p chemotherapy and radiation in [**2191**] with local recurrence diagnosed [**4-10**] who developed hemoptysis and was transferred for bronchial artery embolization.
He underwent a right bronchial artery embolization (330-550 microns) which was uncomplicated.
After the procedure the patient was transferred from angio table to stretcher and developed tachypnea to 40s, desaturation to low 80s on 2L NC and significant work of breathing.
He was given 1mg morphine and albuterol treatment with some ease in breathing.
NRB was weaned to simple face mask.
Stage IIIB NSCLC, s/p radiation and chemotherapy in [**2191**].
Patient was started late [**2199-10-2**] on palliative chemo with Gemcitabine and has had five cycles.
LENIs [**2199-12-9**]: FINDINGS: Grayscale, color and Doppler images were obtained of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal and tibial veins.
The aerated portions of the right middle and right lower lobe display bronchiectasis, interstitial septal thickening and surrounding ground-glass opacities.
Under continuous fluoroscopic and palpatory guidance, the right common femoral artery access was obtained using a micropuncture system, which was then exchanged for a 5 French vascular sheath, the sidearm of which was connected to a continuous heparin flush.
A 5 French pigtail catheter was then advanced into the aorta over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7648**] wire and aortogram was performed.
Next, multiple different catheters over the wire were tried to cannulate the common bronchial trunk arising from the aorta.
Due to the tortuous and acute orientation of the origin of the common bronchial trunk, the cannulation and advancement of the catheter was difficult.
However, with extreme care, a Renegade catheter over an angled Glidewire was advanced further into the common bronchial trunk.
300-500 micron Embospheres were then used to embolize with intermittent saline flushes.
Further embolization was stopped when stagnancy in antegrade flow was noted.
The catheter and the wires were then removed followed by the vascular sheath and manual pressure held over the arterial puncture site for about 15 minutes until good hemostasis was achieved.
Far distal embolization selectively into the right bronchial artery was not possible at this stage due to the difficult angle of origin and tortuousity.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 79-year-old male with history of NSCLC s/p chemo and XRT in [**2191**] now with local recurrence who developed hemoptysis and s/p right bronchial artery embolization who developed hypoxic respiratory distress.
# Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient developed hypoxemic respiratory distress after being turned on right side after procedure.
He was started and continued on IV vanocmycin (day 1 was [**12-7**]) and cefepime (day 1 was [**12-7**]) as all cultures remained negative.
He then spiked a fever and flagyl was started on [**12-9**].
The patient was given nebulizations to ease any possible bronchospastic response.
No peripheral signs of DVT, including negative LENIs although pt is mildly tachycardic and PE was not entirely excluded as CTA was not done with PE protocal.
However, cancer and PNA can explain his oxygen requirement and anticoagulation treatment would be risky given recent arterial access, embolization, and hemoptysis.
He generally requires 4-5L of oxygen to maintain sats in the low 90s (has h/o hypercarbia and COPD) with intermittent needs for facemask ventilation in the setting of coughing fits.
He was started on morphine 5mg po prn SOB.
He also has a lot of anxiety which he receives lorazepam 0.5mg po as needed.
He is also on standing tylenol to suppress fever.
The patient expressed his wishes to die at home, but the family was not able to organize 24 hour home care and preferred that the patient be discharged to a [**Hospital1 1501**] to complete his IV antibiotics course before making a decision about how to approach his care at home.
# Hemoptysis: The patient has stable hematocrit and is s/p bronchial artery embolization.
The procedure went very well, but he desatted to the 80s after the procedure when he layed on his right side as he was being transferred to the stretcher.
His desaturation improved on nonrebreather, resolved within hours with weaning to nasal cannula, and was likely ssecondary to mucous plugging.
He only had minimal hemoptysis after the procedure and once or twice in the week following.
His heparin sc was stopped and should remain off given risk of bleeding.
# Metastatic NSCLC: The patient is undergoing palliative chemotherapy with Gemcitabine.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued statin .
#.Hyponatremia: Is SIADH also likely a hypovolemic component given decreased pos.
# Insomnia in setting of respiratory issues: Pt does well on trazodone 25mg qhs.
