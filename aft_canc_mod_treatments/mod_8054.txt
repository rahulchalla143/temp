Bony fusion is not complete in the right ischiopubic junction, and if this as a potential source of concern, oblique views should be obtained.
Tracheostomy present.
Prior C2-C3 ACDF with anterior instrumentation and intervertebral disc spacer.
Per their recommendation she was started on additional eye drops, Dorzolamide 2%/lacrilube TID, for the bleeding from her cracked conjuntiva.
On [**2-23**] she underwent the cerebral angiogram angio with coil and sacrafice of right carotid.
Orthopedic surgery was consulted in the hospital for follow up of her tib/fib fractures and pelvic injury.
A family meeting was held on [**2184-3-5**] in which discharge planning was discussed, some major points: - Follow-up / signs to look for were discussed - Patient teaching on SAH and normal course of recovery - Cognitive therapy resources were pointed out - Pain management and Methadone taper:      - [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 90747**] manages opioid withdrawl, weaning Methadone, but can not be  on Vivitrol until off dilaudid.
We will also provide narcotic Rx for 7 days.
At this point, the patient will discuss her readiness to stop Dilaudid for pain and use non-opoid forms of pain management so she may restart her Vivitrol.
Neurosurgery will provide a refill at that time if patient feels she is not ready but our main goal would be to provide a Rx for a non-opoid medication that will be accepted by the protocol [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) **] can restart the Vivitrol.
