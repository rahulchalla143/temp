Chest CT Hemodialyis with additional ultrafiltration sessions.
The pt did not complain of any fever, chills, increased cough, chest pain, abd pain, melena, or hematochezia.
She was in acute resp distress and was intubated immediately and placed on CMV ventilation.
Propofol gtt was started for sedation, resulting in decreased BP to 70/42.
Propofol was then d/c, and levophed was added, resulting in increased BP to 118/55.
The MICU team was then called for further evaluation.
CAD s/p NSTEMI [**5-19**], s/p PTCA/stent LCX [**2113**].
Persantine MIBI [**4-22**] without symptoms or EKG changes.
ESRD on HD since '[**10**] (M, W, F) 5.
History of RUL segmental PE in [**11/2114**], on coumadin ([**2114-12-5**]) D/C'd in 06/[**2115**].
Recently diagnosed right popliteal DVT [**7-/2115**], restarted on Coumadin 9.
Eosinophilic pneumonia diagnosed [**4-22**], on chronic prednisone therapy.
Ex-smoker (60 pack-year smoking history)   Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: On admission to MICU: PE:  T 103, HR 112, BP 118/55, O2 sat 100% CMV 500 x 12/40%/5 Gen: chronically ill appearing woman lying flat in bed, intubated, moving all 4 extremities in NAD.
Endotracheal tube properly positioned with tip at the thoracic inlet.
There is an endotracheal tube in place.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 69 year old woman with HIV on HAART (last CD4 940), CHF (EF 50%) COPD, eosinophilic pneumonia, prior DVT and PE on coumadin, and ESRD on HD who presented to this hospital on [**11-28**] for 2 dyspnea and was found on arrival to be in acute respiratory distress.
She was intubated immediately and placed on CMV ventilation.
Of note the patient also became hypotensive soon after a propofol drip was started for sedation.
Propofol was then discontinued, and levophed was added, resulting in increased BP to 118/55.
The pt was admittted to the MICU and was treated empirically with broad spectrum antibiotics along with hydrocortisone for possible COPD exacerbation.
In the MICU the pt was weaned off pressors fairly quickly, extubated by hospital day 2, and was subsequently transferred to the floor.
She underwent several rounds of ultrafiltration in addition to her regular hemodialysis which resulted in improvement of her volume status as evidenced by her improvement in respiratory status, her physical exam, and by resolution of pulmonary edema on chest x-ray.
As her admission INR was subtherapeutic, she was maintained on a heparin drip along with coumadin for her history of DVT and PE until therapeutic INR was reachieved.
In summary, this is a 69 year old HIV positive woman on HAART with CHF, COPD, ESRD on HD, and history of DVT and PE on coumadin who was admitted in respiratory failure, intubated briefly and treated empirically for pneumonia with broad spectrum antibiotics, for COPD exacerbation with steroids, and with hemodialysis for evidence of CHF exacerbation.
Her respiratory status satisfactorily improved with these treatments and it was felt that her presentation was largely secondary to volume overload from CHF exacerbation.
Status post extubation [**11-29**], doing well.
- breathing improved well with serial ultrafiltration sessions along with dialysis.
Pt to continue regular dialysis sessions as outpatient.
- question PNA; although no source was identified, pan cultures were unrevealing, Pt received empiric 10 day course of levofloxacin, flagyl, and vancomycin (start [**11-28**]) - AFB smear negative, PCP negative [**Name Initial (PRE) **] serum CMV IgG positive, IgM negative suggesting no recent exposure.
COPD: Has required intubation in past for COPD.
Initially received high dose steroids which were tapered down to her home dose - continue atrovent/albuterol nebulizers.
- on prednisone taper to 10 tomorrow.
-Initially held metoprolol, lisinopril 2.5 q day and Isordil 10 [**Hospital1 **].
Pt with known CAD s/p p NSTEMI [**5-19**], s/p PTCA/stent LCX [**2113**].
-continue ASA 325 -restarted metoprolol and titrated up until rate control was optimized -continue imdur and lisinopril as outpatient.
ESRD on HD (M,W,F), her CHF exacerbation and fluid status were largely managed by hemodialysis and additional ultrafiltration sessions.
-Pt to continue regular HD schedule as outpatient.
Unclear compliance with meds but pt says she has been taking them.
- continued home dose ofsteroids prednisone to taper.
H/O DVT, possible oncompliance given INR was 1 on admission.
- pt was successfully bridged with heparin and discharged on coumadin with therapeutic INR .
DM2: controlled with sliding scale with NPH while in hospital.
