Admission Date:  [**2159-8-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-9-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-11-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Penicillins / Erythromycin Base  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Elective admission for resection of left sided meningioma  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left craniotomy for resection of meningioma  History of Present Illness: 83 yo F with known left parasaggital meningioma, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who has had progressive right leg weakness and difficulty walking over the past several months to a year.
She is altering her gait and using upper body strenght to walk and climb stairs.
Work-up of right leg weakness included MRI thoracic and cervical spine that show only mild degenerative changes and chronic T9 compression fx.
Past Medical History: HTN, high cholesterol, oral lichen planus, left sided parasaggital meningioma (as above), hypothyroid, Irritable bowel syndrome, GERD, sciatica, aortic/mitral valve insufficiency, recent PNA 3 weeks ago treated as outpatient.
Coordination: finger-nose-finger and rapid alternating movements decreased on right  Handedness Right   Pertinent Results: [**2159-8-22**] CT Head at 15:00: The patient is status post left frontal craniotomy approach resection of a left parafalcine meningioma as demonstrated on the preoperative examinations.
IMPRESSION: Status post left frontal craniotomy for resection of a known left parafalcine meningioma.
[**2159-8-22**] CT Head at 19:00: FINDINGS: Again are noted post-craniotomy changes from a left frontal approach with skin staples and a small amount of subcutaneous emphysema.
IMPRESSION: Status post left frontal craniotomy for left frontal mass resection, with stable appearance of left frontal hemorrhage in the resection bed.
Significant amount of pneummocephalus in the bifrontal regions with displacement of the frontal lobes; while this is not significantly changed from prior, correlate clinically for tension pneumocephalus.
[**2159-8-23**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) **]: S/post resection of the previously noted left frontal extra-axial enhancing lesion, likely representing dural-based lesion such as meningioma.
Post-surgical changes are noted, with presence of blood products at the surgical resection site.
A few enhancing areas are noted in the surgical resection site and residual tumor cannot be excluded.
In addition, there is a new moderate sized area of altered signal intensity in the left parietal lobe, with hypointense appearance on the T1 and hyperintense on the T2-weighted sequence with some degree of decreased diffusion concerning for an infarct in this location.
The ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces are otherwise unremarkable, except for mass effect by the blood products in the surgical resection site in the left lateral ventricle.
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with retrocardiac atelectasis.
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette with retrocardiac atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to neurosurgery service for elective admission and underwent a left sided craniotomy.
She tolerated this procedure well with no complications.
She remained stable overnight into the morning of [**8-23**] when she was examined and rounds and found to have no movement of her [**Last Name (un) **], minimal TFR to noxious with her RLE and was grossly full with her left side.
On the evening of [**8-23**] she was noted to have two seizures which was exhibited by right sided rigidity and left side shaking and hiccuping.
She was started on a second anti seizure [**Doctor Last Name 360**], Keppra, continuous EEG monitoring was ordered.
Post-intubation she was bradycardiac to the 20's and Atropine was given.
Family meeting was scheduled for [**8-30**] and the family decided to allow for more time for improvement in the patient's mental status before committing to tracheostomy and PEG.
Right Upper extremity Doppler was performed on [**8-30**] due to swelling and demonstrated only a superficial thrombus was discovered, no evidence of occlusive DVT.
It was managed with warm compresses and elevation.
Patient was started on vancomycin on [**8-31**] for pneumonia.
EEG showed seizure activity and we increased dilantin to 200 tid.
She was cultured for elevated WBC count to 16 on 8.7.
She was without seizure activity on EEG and her neuro checks were made Q2 hrs.
Over the next several days she continued to have intermittent focal seizures and her Keppra dose and dilantin dose were uptitrated periodically to control seizure at the recommendation of neurology.
Additional family meetings were held between the ICU attending and the family on [**9-3**] and between the Neurosurgery attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the family on [**7-25**] to discuss the options of tracheostomy and PEG in the setting of poor neurological prognosis.
Family meeting was held and given the grim prognosis, goal of care of changed to comfort measures only and patient was extubated.
