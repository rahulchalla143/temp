He also received zofran 4mg IV x1 for nausea after NGL.

Patient was treated with levofloxacin with resolution of abdominal pain.
Discharged with instructions to complete 7 day course of levofloxacin, then to start on ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis.
On furosemide, aldactone, nadolol as outpatient.
These were initially held due to hypotension above, but then were added back (although furosemide and nadolol added at lower dose that on admission).
Otherwise, treatement of SBP as above, and treatment of anemia as below.
Etiology of patient's anemia felt to be likely multifactorial - due to history of CLL, perhaps some low grade hemolysis (50% indirect bili, low haptoglobin, but normal LDH, and in setting of transfusions and cirrhosis, so difficult to interpret), as well as perhaps low grade bleed from esophageal varices.
He is on coumadin for AFib and aspirin as an outpatient, which were held on admission.
He was discharged with stable Hct, off of his coumadin and aspirin, on [**Hospital1 **] protonix, with follow up with his PCP to check hematocrit as outpatient to ensure remains stable.
As above, coumadin held on admission due to decreased Hct.
Otherwise remained rate controlled on nadolol during hospital course.
Patient was given IV lasix with blood transfusions, and as above, was discharged on lower dose of lasix than presented on.
