Skin: dry Rectum: area covered with brown liquid stool, peri-rectal area erythematous but without deep ulceration Neuro/Psych: delusional thought processes stating that without constant laxative use she will become painfully constipated in seconds, able to articulate that copious diarrhea is bad for her health, but still requesting laxatives and stating she will leave the hospital to use them if not given them here, also fixated upon diet and idea that multiple physicians have taken poor care of her in the past and that she is better able to care for her health than they are .
She was started empirically on Vanco/Cefepime given her history of recurrent UTIs, including enterococcus and enterobacter and E. Coli.
The patient's blood pressure improved with IVF boluses and antibiotics.
Eventually, her urine grew out E. coli that was resistent to ciprofloxacin and renal U/S was performed which revealed mild right hydropephrosis, right staghorn calculus as well as small non-obstructing stones in the left kidney.
She was initially placed on ceftriaxone, but later switched to cefpodoxime since patient refused IV antibiotics and did not want a PICC line to be placed.
Diarrhea: Initially thought to be most likely related to heavy use of laxatives and many stools at home, however, it persisted after cessation of laxatives and concern for crohn's flare.
Pt started on IVF to replace fluid loss and lytes were repleted.
She was on mesalamine during her hospital stay, but there was concern for crohn's flare.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] spoke with the patient about different treatment options, but patient refused any additional work-up give her history of Crohn's disease.
Also, given issues with non-compliance would be hesitant about initiating treatment with immunosuppresants.
She was started on zyprexa 2.5mg with PRN for increasing episodes of agitation.
Acute renal failure: Likely related to volume depletion in the setting of profound diarrhea.
However, also had concerning history of pyelo in the past with inadequate treatment courses due to leaving hospital AMA.
Kept on IVF and Cr trended down re-inforcing diagnosis of pre-renal etiology.
Received KCL overnight.
Her potassium remained stable and required minimal repletion.
She was refusing repletion and so was discharged with a magnesium of 1.4. .
H/o possible Pylonephritis: Has chronic staghorn calculi on recent CT and recent treated with course of cefpodoxime.
She had minimal hydronephrosis and was not interested in a perc nephrostomy tube even if she qualified for one.
Crohn's Disease: Has refused ileostomy in the past and doesn't take her mesalamine at home.
Pt reports not taking home mesalamine but was given on prior admissions and given during this admission.
