Echocardiogram prior to chemotherapy showed LVEF 65% and was otherwise unremarkable.
Repeat bone marrow biopsy on [**2196-7-26**] pending.
He was started on vancomycin, cefepime.
Levofloxacin was added in ICU and later discontinued.
Micafungin was added for fungal coverage when patient continued to spike fevers on antibiotics.
No culture growth, and fevers resolved with treatment of leukemia.
Bronchoscopy was performed and patient empirically started on Voriconazole pending BAL galactomanin results.
Patient also developed diarrhea, C. diff toxins were negative, but PCR positive, so patient started on PO Vancomycin.
# Drug rash: rash to cefepime, IV vancomycin, allopurinol per skin biopsy.
Eventually he was placed on cipro/tobra for GNR coverage; his E.Coli cx from [**7-11**] was resistant to cipro and intermediate to tobra.
Found in afib w RVR on routine physical exam one morning.
Given lopressor 5mg IV x2 with little response.
Started PO lopressor and digoxin, which overnight caused [**1-21**] second pauses.
Would consider coumadin if afib recurs.
Placed on steroids for 2 days only, after which symptoms resolved.
# Hypoxia: Was noted to be hypoxic to 80s while sleeping early into hospital course, placed on nonrebreather and transferred to ICU for monitoring and management.
Repeat chest x-ray was suspicious for pneumonia vs. leukemic infiltrate vs. pulmonary edema, so his abx coverage was broadened to vancomycin, cefepime and levofloxacin and he was also given lasix.
Pain controlled with lidocaine patch.
Resolved with treatment of leukemia.
# History of portal vein thrombosis: Occurred in the setting of spleenectomy which was complicated by portal vein thrombosis and hemorrheage.
Given expected thrombocytopenia with chemotherapy, and the need for urgent central line placement, warfarin was held and INR reversed with FFP and Vitamin k.  Repeat CT abdomen showed resolution of portal vein thrombosis, so coumadin was not restarted on discharge.
Reassess need to continue PO diltiazem as patient remained in sinus rhythm since [**7-10**].

You were started on chemotherapy called "7+3" which you tolerated well.
You were transferred to ICU for a short time for monitoring of your oxygen levels while you were on supplemental oxygen.
Your bone marrow biopsy in the middle of chemotherapy showed no signs of malignant cells.
You can stop your hydroxyurea for polycythemia because these cells should be treated from the chemotherapy.
We started you on a heart rate control medication called Diltiazem.
If this irregular heart beat starts again, you may need anticoagulation with coumadin.
Please continue diltiazem and follow up with your doctors.
Your blood grew E. coli and Enterococcus (two types of bacteria) and you were treated with antibiotics through the vein.
You developed rashes on your back and on your chest while you were on the antibiotics.
You will continue on Meropenem and Daptomycin (antibiotics) until [**8-4**].
This may change depending on the final result of your bronchoscopy.
We treated you with oral antibiotic, and you will continue Vancomycin till [**8-18**].
We also stopped your lasix because your blood pressures were on the lower side and you do not have significant edema.
We stopped your Coumadin because your portal vein thrombosis is no longer present.
