Surgery consult felt R hematoma was concerning for possible persistent bleed but no concern for compartment syndrome and no surgical intervention indicated.
Patient was admitted to the ICU, fluid hydrated, treated for hyperkalemia, given 2U PRBCs, and rate controlled for intermittent atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Hematology did find pt to be iron deficient, and suggested possible noncompliance with outpatient PCV meds given absence of expected macrocytic anemia while on allopurinol.
Given 2L IVF, 1 dose of vanc/zosyn for presumed obstructive cholangitis and admitted to the ICU for further management.

Gallbladder w/layering sludge but o/w nl gallbladder, no evidence of cholecystitis.
assessment for free air limited by supine positioning and exclusion of non-dependent portion of abdomen on lateral decub view.
He was transitioned to CMO and palliative care was involved making recommendations for the patient's comfort.
Purulent discharge noted at urethral foley insertion site + small purulence at IV insertion sites.
Antibiotic coverage was broadened to vancomycin/zosyn.
Bowel dilatation increased on serial KUBs, so an NGT was placed for decompression.
Surgical options discussed with patient and family, who deferred surgical intervention and changed pt's code status to CMO.
Patient was initially started on unasyn for possible cholecystitis, but this was changed to vancomycin/zosyn when patient became febrile.
ERCP evaluated but no ERCP procedure was performed due to emergent KUB finding of free subdiaphragmatic air, as above.
Patient presented with bilateral R>L lower extremity and scrotal edema.
IVF were initially avoided, but he was given IVF boluses when febrile hypotension developed, with underlying etiology free abdominal air, as above.
History of post-traumatic hematoma diagnosed on previous exam.
He was continued on home ASA and allopurinol, anagrelide held (as above), and hydroxyurea continued to be held per heme recommendations during last admission given the current state of relative anemia with blood loss into the hematoma.
Patient was given lasix to promote diuresis and urine output, with minimal response.
He was kept NPO while awaiting resolution of abdominal distension/bowel dilation.
Home triamterene-hydrochlorothiazid 37.5-25 mg QD and metoprolol 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **] (started during recent admission) were held.
Medications on Admission: allopurinol 100 mg QOD anagrelide 0.5 mg QD aspirin 81 mg QD metoprolol tartrate 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **] triamterene-hydrochlorothiazid 37.5-25 mg QD  Discharge Medications: Expired  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Expired  Discharge Condition: Expired  Discharge Instructions: Expired  Followup Instructions: Expired
