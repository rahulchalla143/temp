He was admitted to the [**Hospital **] hospital from [**2140-12-24**] to [**2140-12-26**] with recurrent hemoptysis and profound hypokalemia and was treated briefly with potassium replacement and supportive care.
He began to experience hemoptysis again while traveling back from the [**Hospital 12162**] campus.
He received atropine x 1 and then went into atrial fibrillation with RVR with rates in the 190s to 200s for which he received lopressor 5 IV x 3 and diltiazem 5 IV x 2 and then a diltiazem drip.
He was given ASA 325 mg po, Beta Blocker as above, Pravastatin 80 mg po for AMI.
He was also started on an amiodarone drip for his arrythmia.
His respiratory status continued to decompensate following his cardiac event.
On the day PTA to [**Hospital1 18**], he was started on ceftriaxone out of concern for pulmonary infection on [**2140-12-31**] with leukocytosis but no fevers and no clear change in sputum production.
He had hemoptysis and was intubated for airway protection.
Per report, the patient's prognosis was discussed repeatedly with the family and intubation was decisively not recommended by the medical team.
Blood pressures post intubation were in the 70s systolic which improved to mid 80s with fluid boluses.

Hypoxia respiratory failure:  Pt was admitted and maintained on AC and then transited to PS.
He was subsequently transfered to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] for continued management of hemoptysis and airway compromise.
He remained intubated after the procedure, and vent settings and pressors were weaned; pressors were off on the night of [**1-2**], and he was extubated on [**1-3**].
Chest tube was placed with resolution, removed prior to discharge.
He did receive one dose of XRT at the VA for reduction in hemoptysis.
He subsequently received four XRT to the right chest during his stay, without recurrence of hemoptysis.
At the VA, Cardiology consulted during acute event who felt no indication for catheterization given metastatic disease and inability to anticoagulate given hemoptysis.
He was transfered on Amiodarone gtt and in sinus bradycardia on admission.
EP recommended discontinuing amiodarone as it does not have morbidity/mortality benefits when used for VT in setting of ischemia.
Held metoprolol and ace-inhibitor for hypotension, but continued statin.
A low-dose beta blocker was started on [**1-3**] given adequate blood pressure.
Which was transiently tapered down, but in the setting of hemoptysis was increased.
Pressors were weaned over the course of the day on [**1-2**] and were turned off on [**1-3**].
Hyperlipidemia - continued home pravastatin .
hypokalemia -- required scheduled daily repletion, may be related to adrenal mets, discharged with VNA instructions to draw chemisty to follow potassium levels.
Planned for evaluation by radiation oncology for palliative treatments on discharge.
