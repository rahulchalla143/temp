Her husband says she has had several bouts of delerium similar to this, but not as severe.
She was started on Cipro, then switched to ceftriaxone yesterday based on sensitivities.
For some reason this morning, a Foley was placed with only 50cc of urine output since 9 a.m.  She was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Patient was given vancomycin, meropenem, ceftriaxone & 4L IVF.
Central venous line was placed but in poor position.
She had: (1) a non-diagnostic brain biopsy by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 79053**], M.D.
on [**2197-6-2**] demonstrating primary central nervous system lymphoma, (3) s/p 4 induction cycles of high-dose methotrexate started on [**2197-6-5**], (4) s/p 2 doses of rituximab and high-dose methotrexate for progressive disease, (5) s/p whole brain cranial irradiation from [**2197-7-8**] to [**2197-7-27**] to 3,600 cGy for progressive disease, (6) s/p readmission to Medicine Service from [**2197-8-8**] to [**2197-8-11**] for UTI, (7) s/p admission to OMED Service for DVT and PE from [**2197-9-29**] to [**2197-10-4**], (8) s/p hospitalization in OMED from [**2197-10-10**] to [**2197-10-12**] due to purulent [**Month/Day/Year **] from her Portacath, (9) s/p hospitalization for septic shock from [**2198-4-14**] to [**2198-4-23**], and (10) s/p 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide at 200 mg/m2/day x 5 days starting from [**2197-10-3**].

Repeat radiography with PA and left lateral projections is recommended for further evaluation.
Axial T1 and multiplanar MP-RAGE imaging was repeated following the administration of intravenous gadolinium contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Extensive white matter changes, bilaterally, but more prominent on the left, reflect prior radiation treatment and are stable.
Following the administration of intravenous contrast, there is no focus of abnormal parenchymal, leptomeningeal or dural enhancement identified.
No evidence for enhancing lesions following administration of intravenous contrast to suggest progression of CNS lymphoma.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 33754**] is a 54-year-old woman with primary CNS lymphoma, history of PE with IVC filter no anticoagulation since thrombocytopenic, E coli UTI on vancomycin and cefepime, presents with acute mental status changes secondary to radiation encephalopathy.
Altered Mental Status:  Probably radiation enchalatitis and irreversible.
UTI has been treated with vancomycin and cefepime and then finished with cefepime due to 'red man syndrome' with vancomycin.
EEG showed some sharp activities in the left frontal lobe of the EEG, leading to an increase in Keppra 1000 mg IV TID.
She was also started on Celexa 10 mg daily for mood stabilization.
E coli, resistant to quinolones, finished cefepime on [**2198-5-22**].
Vancomycin was initially added for possibility of cellulitis, but discontinued for red man syndrome.
Plastics was consulted and aside from the patient's antibiotics she was initially on for UTI, she was treated with right hand elevation on [**12-26**] pillows at all times and a splint, which was ultimately discontinued due to slight decrease in perfusion of her extremity and weak pulse.
We started synthryoid 50 mcg IV daily since NPO.
Depression:  Initially held citalopram but then resumed 10mg daily through the Dobhoff.
patient should continue tube feeds and albumin monitoring.
Thrombocytopenia:  There is a drop in platelets not associated with heparin products in terms of timing.
Anemia:  She received a cumulative total of 3U pRBCs during her admission.
History of Venous Thromboembolism with DVT and PE with IVC filter:  Although it appears that her thrombocytopenia was due to her chemotherapy, her Lovenox was held during the latter part of her admission.
The pt was initially on TPN and then tubefeeds were started through the dobhoff.
Please continue to monitor albumin until it is greater than 2.5 to assess for G-tube placement.
