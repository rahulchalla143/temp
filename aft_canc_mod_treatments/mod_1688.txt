She developed progressive shortness of breath with hypoxia while on the medical floor, and ultimately required intubation on [**8-15**] for worsening hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis; necessitating transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
She was treated with antibiotics including ceftazidime and vancomycin.
She continued to mount fevers and required ventilatory support despite continued antibiotic treatment and diuresis; likely as a result of her inability to clear her pneumonia and lymphomatous involvement of the lungs.
