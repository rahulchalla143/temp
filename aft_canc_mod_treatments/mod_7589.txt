Mesothelial cells and inflammatory cells.
She was intubated for protection of ventilation.
Increased osmotic load after receiving IV contrast was also considered, as was ACS although EKG was not suggestive of this and troponin trended down from 0.12 to 0.11.
She received 40mg IV lasix on the day of admission and her respiratory status improved markedly after being only 800cc negative.
She received further boluses of IV Lasix and eventually started Lasix drip on [**8-4**] with adequate UOP; this was discontinued on [**8-5**].
Due to a rise in the Cr to 1.3 and physical appearance of being dry, additional lasix was not given.
To evaluate for cardiac ischemia (trop leak, local wall motion abnl and unexplained pulmonary edema) and the pericardial effusion, cardiology was consulted.
Their assessment was that the event was most consistent with diastolic dysfunction and recommended initiation of labetalol and lipitor - in addition to the ACEI and aspirin she already was on.
Due to the Echo parameters of RA 0-5 mmHg, collapsable IVC and RA/RV collapse, rising Cr, additional diuresis was not considered necessary.
Patient improved with diuresis, and was discharged on Lasix 80 mg [**Hospital1 **], labetalol, atorvastatin, and lisinopril with ASA.
THoracentesis was performed and 600 cc withdrawn.
There was no evidence of GI bleed, and ferritin was 487, suggesting iron deficiency was not a likely etiology.
She was given one unit of PRBCs with good response.
Home meds were restarted, with close monitoring of renal function.
#Renal insufficiency- Patient's creatinine increased to 1.3 and was stable throughout remainder of hospital course during aggressive diuresis.
# Access: Patient with port that was not having blood return during her outaptient CT prompting angio study.
