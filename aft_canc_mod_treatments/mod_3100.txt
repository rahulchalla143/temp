Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Chemotherapy Intubation Initiation of Hemodialysis Blood transfusions Platelet transfusions Subclavian line placement Tunneled Hickman line placement x 2   History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 50789**] is a 40 yo F with AML, admitted for a sibling-matched [**Known lastname 51240**].
She underwent 7+3+3 induction chemotherapy and two cycles of high dose cytarabine consolidation and attained a complete remission.
Her post-induction course was complicated by E. coli bacteremia for which she was treated with a 14 day course of levofloxacin.
Following that, she developed some left facial numbness and was treated with Valtrex and clindamycin for possible shingles and tooth infection.
Her Hickman line was removed, she was treated with Bactrim, became afebrile, and was discharged on [**9-17**] on Bactrim DS 2 tabs tid.
H/O line infections with E. coli, Nocardia  Surgical history: 1. s/p C4-6 fusion due to herniated disk in [**2193**] 2. s/p Tubal ligation.
3. s/p Tonsillectomy.
2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally Neuro: A&O x 3 Skin: Left triple lumen and right Hickman catheter sites with minimal dried blood, otherwise clean.
Interval development and worsening of diffuse bilateral ground glass opacity within the lungs with multiple areas of more dense nodular opacity and collapse/consolidation of the right lower lobe with bilateral pleural effusions.
CXR [**11-4**] (last CXR): Right and left central venous lines and ET tube are in stable position.

She received thymoglobulin [33mg on day -3 (0.5mg/kg), 132 mg on days -2, -1 (2mg/kg)], cytoxan 3720 mg (60mg/kg) [**Hospital1 **] on days -5 and-4, and TBI on days -3, -2,-1, and day 0.
She received her cells on [**10-2**] (day 0).
She experienced a fair amount of back pain with the ATG that was improved with pre-medication with methylprednisolone, up to 100 mg.  Several hours following her stem cell transfusion she developed a syndrome of severe body aches (especially in her head, back, and legs), rigors, and tachycardia.
This was thought to be a delayed reaction to the ATG and she felt better after being treated with Solu-Medrol, Benadryl, and Demerol.
The Solu-Medrol was changed to methylprednisolone and weaned to [**11-19**] daily.
After being transferred to the MICU on [**2200-10-22**] for treatment of progressive VOD ( SOS) the patient was continued on daily cyclosporine, initially at 48 mg daily then increased to 54 mg daily to maintain levels of 450-550.
The patient was also continued on steroids of methylprednisolone decreased to 5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Weekly CMV viral load assays were performed which were initially negative.
The patient was then started on Ganciclovir.
The Bone Marrow Transplant team continued to follow the patient during the ICU stay.
Respiratory Failure: On day +2 following her stem cell transfusion she began to complain of a dry cough and required 1-2 L O2 by NC to maintain her sats in the mid 90s.
Since the differential included fluid overload, infectious process, and ATG effect, she was treated for all three possibilities with Lasix for diuresis, broad spectrum antibiotics, and Solu-Medrol for ATG effect.
Over the course of several days her cough resolved, she became less short of breath, and she did not require any supplementary oxygen.
She was diuresed with Lasix with little improvement.
Aggressive diuresis was unable to keep the patients ins and outs completely even.
The patient was electively intubated for airway protection due to worsening encephalopathy and shortness of breath.
Patient was ventilated with assist control ventilation with low tidal volumes ranging from 400-500 and low FIO2 40-50%.
Attempts to transfer to pressure support were unsuccessful due to patient agitation and discomfort therefore AC was maintained throughout her ICU admission.
Galactomanin was negative, although drawn after initiation of antifungal therapy.
Initially, the patient was placed on a Lasix drip increasing to 20 mg per hour with little improvement in diuresis.
Patient was started on hemodialysis on day 2 of ICU admission for fluid removal and acute renal failure.
Daily HD was performed with removal of up to 5 L of fluid daily with no hemodynamic compromise.
Patient was also maintained on high levels of pain control and sedation with Fentanyl and Midazolam since attempts to wean her sedation lead to agitation, tachycardia, and episodes of crying (likely secondary to severe pain).
In terms of coverage for an underlying infectious process, the patient was treated with Meropenem, Caspofungin, and Acyclovir all dosed with HD.
The decision was made not to switch to Voriconazole for coverage of Aspergillus since this medication is hepatotoxic and has numerous drug-drug interactions.
The decision was also made to hold off on bronchoscopy for tissue diagnosis given the patient's coagulopathy and critical condition.
Vancomycin was added on [**2200-10-28**] after blood cultures grew gram positive cocci in pairs and chains.
Patient was also placed on contract precautions for MRSA.
This was sensitive to Vancomycin however.
The patient remained on mechanical ventilation until she passed away on [**2200-11-5**].
Renal Failure: Following her transplant her creatinine rose, thought to be due to cyclosporin toxicity.
The renal team was reconsulted to assess need for hemodialysis and recommendations for diuresis.
Her medications were all renally dosed and eventually dosed with HD.
Her BUN and Cr improved with HD coming down to a Cr of 3.0.
The decision was made to continue intermittent HD vs. CVVH due to the patient's participation in the Defibrotide study since the pharmacokinetics of the drug were unclear and the patient was not to have any procedures performed while receiving Defibrotide.
She was continued on daily HD with removal of increasing amounts of fluid every day, up to 6.5 kg daily.
Unfortunately, the patient had an obligate intake of over 4 L daily and therefore net fluid removal was approximately 1-2 L daily.
Subsequently, the patient missed one day of HD on [**11-3**] due to problems with medication dosing, since the patient required Defibrotide which was restarted.
The patient was monitored for side effects including bleeding.
Initially the patient received q 6 hourly labs including platelets, hematocrit and INR due to high transfusion requirements.
The patient required ongoing platelet transfusions to maintain platelets greater than 50,000.
Her transfusion requirements eventually decreased given the fact that she was rapidly consuming platelets.
On [**10-31**], however, she began to having bleeding from an OG tube that was placed on [**10-30**] and from her ET tube and was transfused to maintained platelets >50.
In terms of FFP, she was transfused approximately 1 unit daily to maintain and INR of 1.5 or less.
After the patient stopped bleeding, Defibrotide was restarted at a lower dose.
Then, CT scan performed on [**11-3**] showed infarction of a large portion of her liver on the right side with question of right hepatic vein thrombosis.
Vascular surgery was consulted and continued to follow the patient, with no recommendations for surgery at that time.
Little treatment could be offered due to her coagulopathy and low platelets.
Meticulous wound care was performed in order to prevent infection.
ID consult was placed regarding her multiple infections and they did not recommend any further changes to her antibiotic regimen.
Meticulous wound care was continued.
Upper GI Bleed: On [**10-30**], NG tube was placed for initiation of a bowel regimen.
The tube was placed without trauma, however, given the patient's low platelets and coagulopathy she started to have some bleeding from the OG tube.
She was started on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].
She also developed some blood tinged secretions from her ET tube on [**10-31**].
She was transfused one unit of RBCs and several units of platelets to keep them greater than 50.
She had intermittent bloody secretions from both her ET and OG tubes over the last few days of her life, on the last day she had dark brown material from her OG tube likely coffee grounds/blood vs. feculent matter.
Her Hct remained relatively stable despite this and required minimal blood transfusions for this problem.
The patient was chest pain free for the next 3 weeks, although she was tachycardic and hypertensive.
Patient's pain was treated and a beta blocker was started on [**10-21**].
She required increased doses of beta blockers with Lopressor 5 mg IV q 6 hrs.
Patient was transfused with FFP approximately 1 unit daily and for plts <30, or <50 with active bleeding.
Hypothermia: Patient with history of low temps in the past down to 92 F. She was treated with warming blankets when she was hypothermic.
Treated with imipenem, then switched to meropenem as her renal function declined.
She was continued on Meropenum throughout her ICU stay for boad coverage given her immunocompromise.
She was therefore treated with Vancomycin without line removal since the line source was unknown.
It was decided that removal and replacement of her central lines would be far too great a risk given her coagulopathy, low platelets and immunocompromise.
This rash remained stable, possibly less severe and was followed clinically with continued broad spectrum antibiotic treatment.
Other psychotropic medications were weaned and Haldol was started.
In the ICU, patient remained intubated and sedated.
She was continued on heavy sedation for comfort with Fentanyl 50 mcg/hr and Midazolam 1 mg/hr.
Septic Shock: Patient with dropping blood pressures x 3 days which began on [**11-3**], requiring pressors with Levophed initially and then vasopressin.
On [**11-5**], the patient was on maximum pressors with still dropping blood pressures.
The differential remained broad but included pneumonia, line infection, intraabdominal infection given positive for enterococcus, CMV, and gordonia.
Surveillance cultures were negative and she was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, antivirals and antifungals.
Her intravascular volume was also maintained with blood products including FFP, pRBCs and platelet transfusion.
Eventually the patient also required IVF boluses although this was a last measure given her severe fluid overload.
Liver Infarction/Splenic infarcts: Initially, patient had dramatically elevated LFTs thought to be due to VOD, this improved with treatment with Defibrotide with essentially normalization of her liver function tests but with persistent hyperbilirubinemia.
An embolic source was considered and Echocardiography was performed which was negative for an embolic source.
Official liver consultation was placed with recommendations for further imaging of the abdomen, however at that stage, the patient was so severely ill that further diagnostic measures were considered futile.
The decision was made with the ICU team and family to continue current treatment but not to provide any further interventions given her worsening status.
Surgery was not an option at that stage given her severe hemodynamic compromise, coagulopathy, multiorgan failure as well as underlying infections and immunosuppression, therefore continue supportive measures were continued while treating underlying infections, maintaining blood pressure support and giving blood products as necessary.
She was continued on Oxycontin 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] with oxycodone 5-10 mg prn.
After development of VOD/SOS, the patient was presumed to have significant pain from underlying hepatic capsule distension and morphine PCA was started.
Upon transfer to the MICU, she was placed under heavy sedation with Fentanyl and Midazolam.
As such she was maintained on these medications for comfort.
FEN: Patient was seen by nutrition and started on TPN for nutrition.
Fluid balance was maintained with HD with volume only given as necessary for transfusion/medications.
Prophylaxis: Initially she was not receiving a bowel regimen since she was maintained on TPN.
Protonix was given coagulopathy and later increased to [**Hospital1 **] with active GI bleeding.
On [**10-30**] and OG tube was placed in order to initiate a bowel regimen.
She had not had a BM since being admitted to the ICU but had only been receiving TPN for nutrition.
OG tube placement was not difficult however patient did develop positive lavage with frank blood and clots the following morning.
As such her bowel regimen was held.
Insulin drip for strict glucose control.
On [**11-5**] discussions with the family during a family meeting concluded that all treatments would be continued but that further treatment would be medically not indicated including cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
