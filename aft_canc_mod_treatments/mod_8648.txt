Admission Date:  [**2151-6-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-7-15**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: Right arm weakness, slurred speech  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Patient is an 84 year old female nursing home resident with PMH of DVT [**3-4**], HTN, GERD, dermatitis.
She awoke this morning at 0540 with right arm weakness, slurred and inappropriate speech and bladder/bowel incontinence.
En route, she reportedly desaturated to 88%, was put on face mask and improved, but required CPR for some reason.
It is not known at this time if she was receiving CPR for cardiac arrest or respiratory arrest.
INR was found to be 6.4 (takes coumadin for h/o DVT this year).
She was given FFP and transferred.
She was electively intubated at the OSH ([**Hospital3 628**]) and arrived here to [**Hospital1 18**] intubated but not sedated.
Past Medical History: DVT [**3-4**], HTN, GERD, Bipolar, Dementia, chronic bladder issues, OA, b/l knee pain with partial knee replacement in past.

ABNORMALITY #2: Background rhythm was usually disorganized.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal discontinuous 24-hour long term EEG monitoring due to the presence of continuous slowing over the mixed delta and theta frequency range over the entire left hemisphere.
As the study progressed, there are initially isolated sharp features over the left temporal region with phase  reversing around T3 and runs of semi-rhythmic 5 Hz theta frequency slowing in the left central region lasting up to 20 seconds.
Beginning in the early evening of the recording, there are frequent semi-rhythmic sharp and slow wave and spike slow wave discharges seen phase reversing around F7 and T3, secondarily spreading over the entire left hemisphere.
Superimposed fast activity is most likely due to medication effect.
The finding likely relates to the intubated status of the patient.
BP was initially maintained below 140 with Labetalol IV, and repeat imaging showed stability of the hemorrhage.
INR was corrected with FFP and proplex.
However, she did receive narcotics at the OSH and was found to have UTI on admission both of which could account for a change in neurological status.
Propofol was weaned and narcotics held.
Aspirin was restarted.
She finished a 7 day course of Levofloxacin for UTI.
Received 2mg IV ativan without any change.
Was loaded with 1 gram IV Dilantin and movements ceased after about an hour.
Patient received 5mg Ativan and 1gram Dilantin in total.
She was not on seizure prophylaxis up until this point.
Was not following any commands but withdrew all four extremities to noxious stim.
Dilantin discontinued as she had cyanotic fingertips which was presumably as a reaction to the Dilantin (purple glove syndrome).
Was loaded on Depakote and maintained with IV doses QID.
Was following commands at 24 hours although very somnolent.
worked with PT and OT who recommended acute rehab.
Her swallowing was discussed several times with her son and HCP, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 111356**], who felt that he did not want to subject his mother to a PEG tube at this juncture, and was hopeful that with more time she would pass a swallow evaluation.
She should continue to be evaluated by speech and swallow at rehab, and if she continues to fail PEG tube will need to be readdressed with him.
Neuro exam on discharge was significant for diffuse mild L sided weakness ([**3-3**] in all muscles groups), trace movement of R ankle but 0/5 strength of all muscle groups on the right, and some inattention and perseveration, as well as problems following complex commands.
On arrival to ICU received additional 500 cc bolus and pressures corrected to acceptable level.
BP stable for several days with no IV boluses required prior to discharge.
RESP: Intubated at OSH.
HEME: INR was initially corrected with FFP and proplex.
She also received some vitamin K SC.
Received tube feeds throughout hospitalization.
ID: Had UTI on admission which was treated with IV Levaquin for 7 days.
