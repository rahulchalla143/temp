Doubt that he had large AMI leading to cardiogenic shock given physical exam and flat CKs, although patient did have troponin elevation.
He was continued on antibiotics (Vanc and Zosyn).
Apparently not a surgical candidate, currently on Dostinex for the tumor.
Endocrine was consulted, and recommended stress dose steroids with taper.
He was continued on hydrocort IV and then eventually transistioned to oral prednisone, 5mg, daily, which he will remain on indefinitely.
He was continued on antibiotics for pneumonia, completed a week course of Zosyn; then given oral Levaquin to complete three more days for total ten day course of treatment.
His Levaquin was discontinued one day early for concern of prolonged QT interval seen on EKG.
He was weaned off oxygen and his blood pressured stabilized despite discontinuation of midodrine.
He was restarted on Zyprexa 2.5mg [**Hospital1 **], which he had been on according to his most recent discharge summary from [**Hospital1 112**].
PT evaluated the patient and recommended further treatment at a rehab facility.
He diabetes was relatively well controlled with 14 units of Lantus daily and a Humalog sliding scale.
This was decreased to 5 units of Lantus as his blood sugars were much lower once the high dose steroids were stopped.
CXR and physical exam most suggestive of fluid overload and the patient had received IVF the day prior for lyte replacement and hypernatremia.
He was maintained on sc heparin for DVT prophylaxis and tolerated a diabetic/low sodium diet well with aspiration precautions.
