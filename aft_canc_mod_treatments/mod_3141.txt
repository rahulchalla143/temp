He was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after a hospitalization for exacerbation of his pulmonary GVHD.
He uses home oxygen and his oxygen saturation had been 95% on 2 liters.
He was given albuterol nebs, seemingly without significant improvement.
He was started on a dopamine gtt.
When he arrived at [**Hospital1 18**], he was hypotensive with SBPs 60-70, and was started on levophed, vasopressin and dopamine.
He was also given 3L fluid bolus.
Acute promyelocytic leukemia - s/p ATRA and arsenic therapy,  allogeneic BMT, complicated by GVHD.
- bronchiolitis obliterans - FVC 2.31; FEV1 0.75; FEV1/FVC 32, with chronic cough - s/p corneal transplant L eye [**6-2**] and s/p cataract removal R eye [**10-3**] - pruritic rash - h/o diarrhea; gallbladder sludge - on ursodiol; lost about 130lbs after BMT 2. history of resistant stenotrophomonas growing from sputum 3. history of Pseudomonas pneumonia 4. chronic kidney disease - unclear etiology, thought to be [**Name (NI) 47605**]; recent baseline 0.9-1.0 5. hypertension 6. history of childhood asthma - hospitalized but not intubated 7. chronic C. difficile  Social History: Married with two children.

Given lack of distention, other possible etiologies include CHF, ascites, and hypoproteinemia should be considered.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment: 51yo man with acute promyelocytic leukemia s/p bone marrow transplant complicated by extensive graft vs. host disease including bronchiolitis obliterans, history of pseudomonas PNA, sputum growing resistant stenotrophomonas, and aspergillus colonization, who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and found to be hypotensive as well.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 227**] his penicillin allergy, he was treated with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, aztreonam (changed from tobramycin), IV flagyl, voriconazole, and IV bactrim.
Colistin was considered, but given its significant toxicity, it was not started and was awaiting stenotrophomonas sensitivities.
He was thought to likely have ARDS secondary to sepsis, and the ARDS protocol for ventilator settings was attempted, but he did not tolerate these settings and became hypoxemic and acidemic.
He was additionally treated with albuterol, atrovent, and flovent.
He required escalating FiO2, evantually at 100%, and remained with persistent acidosis.
He had been switched from dopamine to levophed, vasopressin was added, and the dopamine restarted.
He was likely adrenally insufficient, given his outpatient regimen including prednisone, so he was started on stress-dose steroids.
This was thought to be secondary to lactic acidosis, nongap acidosis from normal saline boluses, and respiratory abnormalities.
His ventilator was set to attempt to correct the acidosis, but his blood pressure and hypoxia were confounding factors.
He was given stress dose steroids and started on GCSF.
C diff - He was treated with IV metronidazole.
Glucose control - His blood glucose was controlled with an insulin drip.
Despite maximal medical management in the MICU, the patient developed progressive organ dysfunction, in the context of advanced GVHD and progressive bronchiolitis obliterans lung disease.
On the second hospital/MICU day, the patient expired following an asystolic arrest.
