Cervical mediastinoscopy with biopsy.
Right thoracotomy with wedge excision and right upper    lobectomy.
I had a long discussion with the family preoperatively and I indicated to them that there is a high likelihood of an open resection given the extent of scarring seen on CT scan from the asbestosis.
Additionally, I discussed the likelihood of performing a wedge excision for diagnosis and therapy given his extensive pulmonary disease and baseline dyspnea.

FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of two right-sided chest tubes.
No definite evidence of pneumothorax following chest tube removal.
Cervical mediastinoscopy with biopsy.
Right thoracotomy with wedge excision and right upper    lobectomy.
The patient will receive an epidural at the end of the case.
I had a long discussion with the family preoperatively and I indicated to them that there is a high likelihood of an open resection given the extent of scarring seen on CT scan from the asbestosis.
Additionally, I discussed the likelihood of performing a wedge excision for diagnosis and therapy given his extensive pulmonary disease and baseline dyspnea.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed under general endotracheal anesthesia with a single lumen endotracheal tube.
We found small lymph nodes in the 4-R position and biopsied two separate areas and sent them for frozen section analysis.
The mediastinoscope was placed as deep as it would go and it was barely within reach of the subcarinal space, due to the lack of extension of his neck and the depth, I was unable to safely biopsy the subcarinal lymph nodes.
On frozen section, there was no evidence of malignancy and, therefore, we closed the wounds after achieving meticulous hemostasis.
We then returned the patient to the anesthesia service who successfully placed a double lumen endotracheal tube.
We attempted to place a single thoracoscopy port in the mid axillary line at approximately the seventh intercostal space.
We then made a posterior lateral thoracotomy dividing the latissimus dorsi muscle but sparing the serratus anterior as well as the trapezius and rhomboids.
We had to carve the lung down using electrocautery off of the asbestosis plaques.
We performed the wedge excision with several firings of the stapler and sent specimens for pathological analysis.
Frozen section analysis demonstrated the margin to be free of tumor, although it was close.
Our discussion was centered around the fact that a lobectomy would run the risk of pushing him into respiratory failure and worsening his dyspnea.
I spoke with his son and his wife about whether or not we should proceed forward with a lobectomy.
Ultimately we came to the group's consensus that we should not proceed forward with a lobectomy but accept a compromise wedge excision.
We then placed two 28 French chest tubes, one anteriorly, one posteriorly.
