On 5L NC O2, her SpO2 increased to 93%.
Paramedics reported a BP of 90/palp and administered a 200 cc bolus with a subsequent BP of 110/88 following fluid bolus.
Her initial ABG on arrival was 7.22/37/149, Initial VS were 101.8, HR 135, BP 90/palp, RR 24, SpO2 of 76% on RA, and CVP 8.
The sepsis protocol was initiated and she was transfused 1u PRBC and given 10L NS and 1L LR.
In addition a RIJ line was placed with development of hematoma.
Lung Cancer - Original diagnosis made in [**2161**], T2N0 s/p right lower lobectomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**].
In early [**2162**], she developed a single frontal lobe metastatic lesion that was resected and treated with radiation therapy.
Following her radiation therapy over the next number of months, she never truly recovered and was felt to have a significant post-radiation encephalopathy.
She was found to have lesions in the liver and was started on tarceva for palliation.
Pulmonary emboli s/p IVC filter placement [**2162**] 9.
Blood cultures 1/4 bottles returned positive for GPC in clusters, and urine grew GBS.
She was started on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
Given the presence of edematous small bowel on CT scan, her stool was screened for c. diff toxin, and she was continued on Flagyl empiricially.
Given her poor prognosis, and after discussion with the family, it was understood that she would be DNR/DNI, no pressors, no CVL, but family wished to continue antibiotics and steroids.
Given her clinical history of watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and edematous bowel on abdominal CT, colitis was considered to be the most likely source.
Ms. [**Known lastname 96131**] was treated with Levofloxacin, and Flagyl for 7 days prior to discharge for presumed sepsis secondary to enterocolitis.
She received 72 hours of empiric therapy with Vancomycin on admission, but Vancomycin was then discontinued after lack of microbial growth to support its necessity.
At time of discharge, the plan was to complete a [**11-19**] day course of IV levofloxacin and metronidazole.
2) Adrenal Insufficiency - A baseline cortisol was elevated at 41.5, without a rise following cosyntropin (although timing of blood test questionable).
She was started on IV hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone for presumed adrenal insufficiency.
3) NSTEMI - During her ICU course her cardiac biomarkers without notable EKG changes.
Findings were considered to be consistent with NSTEMI; however, intervention was deferred given her overall poor prognosis.
Her Tarceva was discontinued during this hospitalization given her inability to take oral medications and the unlikelihood of any benefit from any further chemotherapeutic options.
Her pain was palliated throughout hospitalization with IV morphine and carefully titrated to match her needs.
At discharge, palliative care was decided to be the primary goal, although her family still desired ongoing treatment of her infection with IV antibiotics.
6) Prophylaxis: SC Heparin for DVT prophylaxis and Protonix for GI prophylaxis.
7) FEN: Patient is unable to tolerate PO medications or nutrition.
