The GJ anastamosis site was without ulceration or breakdown, although there was some congestion in the area of cancer recurrence.
Her labs were suggestive of iron defiency anemia, with iron level 9 and ferritin 2.8, likely secondary to slow upper GI bleeding in setting of known recurrent gastric cancer.
EGD demonstrated esophagitis, as well as erythema and petechiae in stomach with contact bleeding but no single place to intervene upon.
She was initially started on an IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], and transitioned to an oral PPI [**Hospital1 **] prior to discharge.
She was also started on sucralfate and ferrous sulfate supplementation.
Iron level was 9 and ferritin 2.8.
