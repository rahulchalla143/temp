Briefly Mr. [**Known lastname 1007**] was admitted on his home regimen of medications and was started on lovenox to treat his DVT.
With regards to his [**Last Name **] problem: lung GVHD, Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] decided to procede with a new therapy called photopheresis which had been discussed on an outpatient basis.
His lovenox was held fo a day prior to placement of his photopheresis catheter, but unfortunately Mr. [**Known lastname 1007**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] profusely and became further hypoxic in the setting of the catheter placement.
He was sent to the MICU, placed on CPAP and diuresed for his hypoxia.
He was kept off anticoagulation and was transfused numerous units of pRBCs.
There continued to be problems controlling his anticoagulation (although his bleeding subsided) and was eventually placed on a low-goal, no bolus heparin nomogram.
He received 2x photopheresis treatments but these were abandoned because his general deconditioning, the ambulance transfer required for the procedure, and the large dose of heparin needed for the treatment were considered to risky for him.
Also with regard to his GVHD of the lungs, he was on mycophenolate and methylprednisolone on admission.
His mycophenolate had to be decreased secondary to thrombocytopenia and he was begun on tacrolimus 1mg po bid.
He was unfortunately found to have worsening [**Last Name (Titles) **] status and a toxic level of tacrolimus (22-25), so this medication was stopped.
His chronic restrictive lung disease was very difficult to manage and he remained dyspneic with a 2-4L N/C oxygen requirement despite maximal diuresis.
With regard to infection: he was on chronic voriconazole for concern of a + sputum culture for aspergillus (not fumigatus) as an outpatient.
He was also on chronic acyclovir and bactrim.
A CXR on [**7-8**] showed an ill-defined density concerning for a fungal infx so he recieved a 14d course of caspofungin with resolution of this radiographic finding.
As part of his thrombocytopenia work-up he was found to have a positive CMV viral load and was started on gancicyclovir.
His tacrolimus level was found to be 25 and this medication was held.
he was begun on a morphine drip with a scopolamine patch with ativan for respiratory comfort.
