Urine culture ([**4-17**]): no growth Surveillance blood cultures: BCx x 2 [**4-17**] - NGTD BCx [**4-18**] - NGTD Cath tip [**4-20**] - NGTD  Imaging Studies:  CT abdomen/pelvis ([**4-17**]):   CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: In the visualized thorax, there is a new small right pleural effusion with associated relaxation atelectasis.
A new duodenal stent is seen.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is a right fluid-containing inguinal hernia (series 2, image 95).
Two stents are seen in the right upper abdomen.
Stable appearance of heterogeneous liver with mild-moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.
Brief Hospital Course: A 73 yo man with metastatic inoperable cholangiocarcinoma with history of gastric outlet obstruction s/p stenting presented with hypotension, fever/chills, increased ascites and poor po intake.
# Hypotension/Klebsiella Bacteremia/Fever:  In the ED he received 3-3.5L IVF with persistent hypotension and lactic acidosis so he was admitted to the MICU due to concern for sepsis.
He was continued on empiric antibiotics which had been started in the ED with Zosyn for possible GI source for sepsis.
Meanwhile, he was bolused with fluids prn to maintain MAP >60 in addition to which he received albumin to increase oncotic pressure.
Surgery was consulted for a possible G or J tube placement but his CT scan was without obstruction, however he stated that he felt his ascites was hindering his po intake and given his recent infection surgical options were not further pursued.
He was started on marinol 2.5 mg qam daily to help improve his appetite and underwent a therapeutic paracentesis on [**4-21**] during which 4 L were removed.
# Cholangiocarcinoma: The patient has a history of inoperable cholangiocarcinoma s/p biliary stent and duodenal stent.
He has been undergoing treatent with xeloda and last received this on [**4-13**].
As above a therapeutic paracentesis was preformed on [**4-21**] during which 4 L were removed.
His lasix and aldactone were held during his inpatient stay and restarted at his home doses at discharge.
Heparin was stopped, however his platlets began to improve even during his last day on heparin.
# Coronary artery disease: He remained asymptomatic during his hospitalization and he was continued on his home ASA and Plavix.
# Atrial fibrillation: He is not anticoagulated as an oupatient; he is on a BB, digoxin and amiodarone at home.
We continued his home digoxin and amiodorone, and held his metoprolol in the setting of hypotension, however this was restarted when he was moved out from the MICU.
We held his glipizide and started humalog sliding scale insulin during his hospitalization.
His glipizide was restarted at discharge.
