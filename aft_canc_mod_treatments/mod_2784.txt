Eventually discontinued due to toxicity - MTX 10mg/m2 IVB day +1, +3, +5 - GCSF 300mcg/day started on day +6, discontinued when ANC was >1000 - Patient was on cyclosporin [**Hospital1 **] dosing, discontinued due to DAH thought to be [**1-9**] cyclosporin - ANC started trending up on [**7-5**], now engrafted ANC 3880 [**2200-8-29**] - CT on [**8-27**] showed interval decrease in size of mass.
started Cefepime, continued on Fluconazole, and acyclovir; spiked again on [**7-1**], vanc started; spiked again on [**7-2**], vori started; spiked [**Last Name (un) 59331**] on [**7-2**] and [**7-3**] am, new non-blanching petechia noted on [**2200-7-3**],  flagyl started on [**7-3**]; continued to spike on [**7-4**] to 103.5, a hypotensive episode on [**7-4**] am, responsive to IV fluids (500ml resuscitation), BP stabilized throughout the day, received >4gm tylenol for fever, rash worsened, CXR clear, RUQ showed no evidence of VOD; [**7-5**]: Rash worse on the chest, face and arms, GVHD vs drug rash, d/C'ed cefepime, and started aztreonam; Cxs continued to be negative to date, CXR has been clear to date, currently on Aztreonam, vanc, acyclovir (PO per ID), vori, flagyl, chest CT (non contrast) on [**7-5**] showed no evidence of infections .
She recieved multiple antibiotics including levofloxacin, voriconazole, vancomycin, aztreonam, bactrim, and fluconazole.
At the time she received solumedrol 100mg IV x 2d and lasix for possible engraftment syndrome, but had no improvement.
She was then placed on solumedrol 1gm IV x 4d for DAH, respiratory status improved, and she was extubated on [**7-15**].
She was transferred back to the ICU for hypoxia/hypercarbia where she was intubated for a second time.
Her CSA was held again.
She was continued on Acyclovir, Caspofungin and Bactrim for prophylaxis.
She was started on Cellcept 500mg tid for immunosuppression given possible DAH [**1-9**] CSA.
Her O2 requirements were eventually weaned down enough to come back to the floor on [**8-11**].
Initially on the floor the patient continued to require 4L NC to maintain sats in 90s and with diuresis she was eventually weaned off oxygen.
Her Solumedrol was slowly tapered and now she is on oral Prednisone, 10mg daily.
Initially her HTN was refractory to medication and she required a labetolol drip for about 20 hours.
She was then continued on Clonidine patch, Norvasc 10mg daily, Metoprolol 100mg tid and Hydralazine 10mg tid.

After transfer to the floor the patient began taking more PO and TPN was continued until [**8-21**], at which point her PO intake was sufficient.
