Brief Hospital Course: Brief Course: 76 yo F with cholangiocarcinoma s/p modified classical whipple with portal vein reconstruction and J-tube placement ([**2127-4-7**]), who presented with abdominal pain and hypotension.
She was found to have Klebsiella bacteremia and treated with IV antibiotics.
Her course was complicated by C. difficile infection for which she received oral metronidazole.
Active Issues # Klebsiella Bacteremia: Patient presented with abdominal pain, fever, chills, and hypotension.
She was admitted to the ICU where she received fluids and was initially treated with vancomycin/cefepepime/metronidazole.
Her antibiotics were narrowed to cefepime and metronidazole after one of four vials grew gram negative rods.
Speciation showed Klebsiella and antibiotics were further narrowed to ceftriaxone and metronidazole.
Her blood pressure improved without the need for pressors and patient was transferred to the floor.
She was transitioned to oral ciprofloxacin and oral metronidazole, continued to do well and was discharged to complete a 14 day antibiotic course.
# C. Difficile: Patient's course was complicated by c.diff infection likely secondary to the antibiotics used to treat her bacteremia.
She was treated with oral metronidazole and her diarrhea improved.
She will continue her oral metronidazole for 2 weeks after her last dose of ciprofloxacin.
# Abdominal Pain: Patient's J-tube was noted to be clogged at the [**Hospital3 2558**] which may have been causing her pain.
We held her tube feeds and advanced her diet as tolerated.
# Cholangiocarcinoma - s/p whipple in [**2127-3-16**].
Patient is moving back to her home in [**Location (un) 3844**] upon discharge, so patient elected to have future radiation treatments at [**Hospital6 5016**] which is closer to her new residence.

Was placed on insulin sliding scale without basal dose while hospitalized, but had very little requirement, so patient was not discharged with insulin and will follow up with her PCP.
