Brief Hospital Course: On [**2186-3-24**], Mr. [**Known lastname 91900**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] right hepatic lobectomy and Whipple procedure for distal cholangiocarcinoma with metastasis to the right lobe of the liver.
He was intubated and sedated postoperatively for a prolonged period due to revision of pancreaticojejunostomy, drainage of right upper quadrant abscess and redo of pancreaticojejunostomy on [**4-8**] for pancreaticojejunostomy dehiscence.
He had open abdomen and need for repeated abdominal washouts.
He remained on pressor support (neo,vasopressin from [**Date range (1) 89937**]).
Octreotide was also started due to continued bleeding after initial OR on [**4-8**].
Following diuresis with a Lasix drip the patient subsequently returned to the OR [**4-25**] for closure.
Thoracentesis was done on [**4-21**] and [**4-28**] for 1200 cc and 1000 cc respectively.
Thoracentesis was again performed on [**5-16**] for large pleural effusion.
IV Ciprofloxacin was administered for 15 days.
Reaccumulation of the pleural effusion occurred necessitating repeat thoracentesis with pigtail drain placement was done on [**5-21**] yielding one liter of exudate.
After review of CXRs , no further intervention was recommended as the thoracic surgery service thought the effusion was most likely reactive from the subdiaphragmatic collection.
Notation of an 8-mm right upper lobe nodule was made and attention on followup scans for surveillance for metastasis was recommended.
He was weaned off oxygen and O2 saturations were greater than 93%.
CXR on [**5-29**] showed slightly decreased loculated right pleural effusion since the prior study still involving the major fissure and still with multiple air-fluid levels consistent with air loculations.
He was maintained on total parenteral nutrition throughout most of his hospital course.
On postop day 32, a post-pyloric feeding tube was placed and tube feedings were started and successfully advanced to goal rate.
From [**Date range (1) 91901**] while critically ill he remained on an insulin gtt which was subsequently weaned off.
PPI therapy was recommended and administered (Protonix [**Hospital1 **]).
He tolerated diuresis with a Lasix drip until successful closure of abdomen on [**4-25**].
While on Lasix drip, urine output remained excellent 100-400 cc/hr with urine output of >4-6L/day.
Following abdominal washout on [**2186-4-8**] he was placed on broad spectrum antibiotics including vanc/zosyn and fluconazole.
On [**2186-4-20**] his PICC line was removed and his CVL was replaced for concern of rising leukocytosis to 14.
Central line was eventually removed and another PICC line was placed ([**5-6**]/)into left upper arm.
On [**5-30**], this line was removed as IV antibiotic course (Ciprofloxacin)was stopped on [**5-31**].
Rehab screen was done per case management and [**Hospital3 **] in [**Hospital1 8**] offered a bed on [**6-1**].
