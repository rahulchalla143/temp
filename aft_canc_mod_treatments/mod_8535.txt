The patient is status post esophagectomy and gastric pull-through with prominent persistent right base opacity seen.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality due to body habitus.
EGD [**2136-10-22**] Evidence of esophagectomy s/p gastric pullthrough.
Given admission with concern for gastrointestinal bleeding polypectomy was not performed.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum  EGD [**10-23**] Evidence of esophagectomy s/p gastric pullthrough.
Capusle endoscopy placement in the stoamch, as it was impossible to pass to the duodenum given the food in the stomach.

He showed symptomatic improvement after blood transfusions and diuresis with IV lasix with the tranfusions.
TTE was obtained and showed mild regional LV systolic dysfunction w/hypokinesis of the anterior septum, severe aortic valve stenosis, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
He was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where he was started on zosyn for coverage of GI organisms.
ANtibiotics were stopped after a few days.
Noninvasive ventilation was attempted but he did not tolerate this and was intubated.
He remained intubated for two days as he had become tachycardic with weaning down to pressure support only and there was fear of flash pulmonary edema from discontinuation of ventilation in the setting of his severe AS.
On [**10-26**] he was eventually weaned from the vent and did well.
There was consideration of a chest CT to get a better sense of anatomy and question of possible emphysema given his large lung volumes despite his prior chest surgeries to help better determine his respiratory status, but the patient declined.
#Hypotension: Transiently required pressors in setting of sedation associated with propofol during intubation but was quickly weaned off when sedation was switched to midazolam.
Patient received 2 untis PRBCs with bump in Hct to 24.6.
GI was consulted and he was scheduled for colonoscopy and upper endoscopy for Monday.
He underwent placement of a capsule into the stomach on [**10-24**] as there was retained food in the stomach and it was unable to be placed into the duodenum.
Patient was discharged with omeprazole 40 mg po daily, but it was not clear that the patient was inclined to take the medication.
He was started on metoprolol for this and by the time of discharge, his heart rates were well controlled in the 70-80s, and did not significantly increase when ambulating.
He opted NOT to start anticoagulation with coumadin despite his CHADS score and stroke risk given his recent GI bleeding for which clear source was not found.
# CAD:  Cardiology service felt that the new mild hypokinesis seen on his ECHO was secondary to ischemia, and they advised starting aspirin 81 mg a day.
Transitional issues - needs hct checked at PCPs office; if he has ongoing GIBleeding without a clear source, he will need outpatient PRBC transfusions to keep hct above 25 given his CAD  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Glargine 10 Units Breakfast 2.
Lisinopril 2.5 mg PO DAILY 3.
Pravastatin 20 mg PO DAILY 4.
