Pt was started on bactrim in addition to his ceftriaxone and azithromycin, as it was felt that his recent steroid taper might have predisposed him to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].
Albuterol/ipratropium nebs were started for COPD relief, however steroids were initially held given possible immunosuppressed state (recent steroids, possible PCP).
However, as the day progressed, Mr. [**Known lastname **] became increasingly dyspneic and experienced desaturations into the mid-low 80's, and the patient was admitted to the ICU where his nebs were continued, steroids added on (inhaled and systemic, the latter for a 2-week course), and antibiotics changed to ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and vancomycin given possible postobstructive pneumonia with sputum cx growing out coag + staphylococci.
The results came back from the sputum cx, showing pcn-resistance, so vancomycin was continued.
Final culture results revealed MRSA and no PCP; vancomycin was continued, and pt was placed on MRSA precautions.
For sputum, started aggressive chest PT, guaifenisen, and mucomyst.
A PICC was placed in anticipation of pt's dispo to a pulmonary rehabilitation facility to finish vancomycin course.
