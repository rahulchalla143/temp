Brief Hospital Course: This is 59 year-old man with hep C cirrhosis s/p liver transplant 10 months ago complicated by recurrent Hep C and chronic rejection who presented with abdmonial pain and was found to have severe spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Due to pt's ill-appearance, and severe SBP, he was admitted to MICU [**9-21**] for further care and monitering.
While in the MICU the patient was started on aztreonam, linezolid, flagyl and levoquin to cover sbp and a possible pneumonia.
His antibiotic regimen was changed to vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl when he was found to have group B Streptococci growing from peritoneal culture.
Mr [**Known lastname 13149**] abdominal pain improved rapidly with antibiotic therapy as well as a therapeutic paracentesis.
The GBS was found to be sensitive to levoquin and he was eventually transitioned to levoquin monotherapy and was discharged to finish a 14 day course with subsuquent ciprofloxacin SBP prophylaxis.
The radiologists subsuquent discussions with the primary team indicated that the CT appearance was more consistent with atelectasis and Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 13150**] hypoxia resolved without heparin therapy.
Mr. [**Known lastname 2379**] is 10 months s/p liver transplant and has both chronic rejection as well as reactivation of his hepatitis C.  He was on treatment with interferon and ribavirin for his hepatitis C on admission in addition to his immunosuppressive regimen.
His hepatitis C treatment had to be discontinued due to his acute illness, and it was difficult to increase his immunosuppressants to treat rejection due to his reactivation of hepatitis C.  He was continued on his home regimen of rapamune, prednisone, and ursidiol.
He was maintainted on a low sodium diet with one therapeutic paracentesis, which he tolerated.
When he clinically improved from an infectious standpoint; lasix 40 and spironolactone 100 were reintroduced without significant renal dysfunction.
