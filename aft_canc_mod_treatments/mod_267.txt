The infectious disease and surgery teams were consulted and after extensive discussion, initially attempted to treat through the line with linezolid, given that the last line was very difficult to place, and resulted in many complications.
However, after she eventually had [**3-10**] surveillance cultures positive for the same organism, ID recommended to pull the line and treat with vancomycin instead.
She was monitored in the ICU for 30 hours given her history of reportedly severe red man syndrome, and tolerated the infusion well with benadryl 50 mg iv and pepcid 40 mg iv premedication 1h prior to vancomycin, as recommended by the Allergy attending (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
She was discharged to complete a 14 day course of vancomycin after the last postive blood culture.
# POTS: She contined her outpatient regimen of florinef, daily potassium repletions between 40-80 mEQ IV, and received normal saline boluses prn SBP<90.
She only required ~2-3 L of IV normal saline boluses for low blood pressure her whole hospitalization.
As she was to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient, urology was consulted and recommended outpatient urodynamic studies.
Allergy recommended possibly benzos or a small dose of neostigmine, [**1-8**] that used for myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], to counteract anticholinergic effects.
Because she tolerated a small amount of beta blocker in the past, we elected to give her the beta blocker (even though she states in higher amounts, she has an "allergy" to it) for the remaining few days of antibiotics/ benadryl.
