The patient is status post diagnosis in [**2182**] of bony metastases and status post STAMP in [**2183-7-17**] via an allodonor.
She is in the midst of chemotherapy with weekly Navelbine.
The patient was referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5166**] for removal of her bilateral adnexal masses for the purposes of diagnosis as well as relief of her bilateral hydronephrosis.
O2 saturation was 93% on room air, temperature 98.6, pulse 79, blood pressure 135/79.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2185-7-12**] where an exploratory laparotomy, radical hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and ureterolysis on the right side were performed.
Intraoperatively, she did receive 5 units of packed red blood cells.
She was therefore taken to the urology suite where cystoscopy and fluoroscopy were done.
She did have a stent placed in the left ureter.
Her creatinine reached a level of 3.3 and the decision was made to place a percutaneous nephrostomy tube on the right side.
After nephrostomy placement, the patient's creatinine eventually dropped to 0.9.
She was started on Ampicillin, Gentamicin, and Flagyl initially and switched over eventually to p.o.
Levofloxacin 500 mg q. day which she is still on.
Her postobstructive diuresis continued and her urine output was very copious, thus diabetes insipidus workup was initiated.
Interventional Radiology came and evaluated and decided that the patient's nephrostomy did not need to be replaced.
There was a small amount of skin breakdown which was improved dramatically with Desitin and dressing changes.
At this point in time, the patient is doing very well, taking a regular diet, and ambulating with the help of physical therapy and assistance.
Of note, the patient did get two additional units of packed red blood cells on [**2185-7-22**].
She was seen by hematology oncology and given Epogen 40,000 units subcutaneously the day before her discharge.

She will have physical therapy at rehabilitation.
