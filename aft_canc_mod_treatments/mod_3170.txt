The patient was given several units of fresh frozen plasma in an attempt to correct her coagulopathy.
Her bloody output from her [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain has somewhat decreased and in an attempt to control her bleeding, the patient was transfused several units of fresh frozen plasma and the patient was also transfused several units of packed red blood cells.
A hematology consultation was then obtained and according to Hematology/Oncology, they believed her coagulopathy was actually all resulting from her liver failure and the patient was continued on tube feed.
The patient also had a history of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection so she was started on Zosyn and Octreotide in an attempt to slow down the [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] output.
Tube feed was continued at 40cc per hour.
However, on [**2172-5-13**], the patient was made comfort measures only by the family.
