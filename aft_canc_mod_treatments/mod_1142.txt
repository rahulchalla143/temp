Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 y/o male with a history of DM1 on an insulin pump last A1c 8.1, hypertension and glaucoma who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis, NSTEMI, and pneumonia.
He was continued on an insulin drip with D5 in normal or [**1-24**] normal saline until the anion gap closed and he was tolerating a PO diet.
He was changed to lantus and sliding scale insulin initially.
However, as the Diabetes service felt that the patient would not be able to resume his insulin pump, and wanted to simplify his insulin regimen as much as possible, with the goal of having the patient being able to manage his own insulin regimen at home, he was then transitioned to a [**Hospital1 **] regimen with Humalog 75/25 mix.
The decision was made to not pursue cardiac catheterization given high probability he would have multivessel disease and the patient was not interested in bypass surgery.
He was put on a heparin drip for 48 hours, started on aspirin, plavix, atorvastatin and metoprolol.
He has also received PRN doses of Lasix for volume overload, but appears to have been euvolemic for several days now off of Lasix.
Can consider additional doses of PRN lasix as needed.
Pt has responded well to low-dose IV lasix of 20mg.
His [**Last Name (un) **] (losartan) has been discontinued to simplify his medical regimen, and his ACE-i can still be uptitrated in follow-up as his blood pressure allows.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for health care acquired pneumonia given that he is a nursing home resident.
He received a course of vancomycin, aztreonam, and levofloxacin x8 days.
