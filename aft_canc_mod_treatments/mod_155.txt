Dedicated PA and lateral chest radiograph may be helpful for initial further assessment when the patient's condition permits .
ECHO ([**4-25**]): Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly to moderately depressed with inferior akinesis and basal infero-septal and infero-lateral hypokinesis.
Inferior akinesis and basal infero-septal and infero-lateral hypokinesis  .
CXR ([**4-30**]): Endotracheal tube is 8 cm above carina.
NG tube is in proximal body of stomach.
Tip of endotracheal tube is difficult to localize on this film, as is the NG tube.
Repeat film may be obtained for better localization of endotracheal tube and NG tube if clinically indicated.
CXR ([**5-3**]): No endotracheal tube present.
Nasogastric tube ends in a mildly distended stomach.
Left subclavian central venous line tip projects over the superior cavoatrial junction.
He was started on IV antibiotics (kefzol and flagyl) and a wound culture grew MSSA.
Noninvasive vascular studies were performed as the patient was a known vasculopath and it was assumed that an intervention would need to be performed to preserve his toe.
On [**4-21**], while on the vascular service, he developed nausea and vomiting while moving around for all of his studies.
He was given reglan and anzemet for his nausea, as well as percocet for his toe pain.
He was felt to be wheezing and he was given nebulizers with good effect.
However, he was then found to be very tachycardic, with a lot of ectopy on telemetry.
He was given IV metoprolol for his tachycardia, but overnight, again developed respiratory distress.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was extubated the following evening, with the hope that treatment for CHF and COPD would have improved his respiratory status.
He was given nebulizer treatments x3, solumedrol, and lasix with no improvement.
On [**2135-4-25**], a TTE was performed which revealed left ventricular systolic function of ~40%, which was considered to be moderately depressed with inferior akinesis and basal infero-septal and infero-lateral hypokinesis.
An attempt was made at thoracentesis given his bilateral pleural effusions, however the IP team did not feel that they could get a good view through which to tap.
An NGT was inserted and tubefeeds were started.
The patient's cardiologist instead recommended using verapamil instead for rate control.
At this point, he was reintubated and diuresis was continued.
EP confirmed that the patient needed to be on a beta-blocker, not a CCB, and brought up the issue of anticoagulation.
They also recommended continuing with diuresis and attempting extubation again only after his pulmonary edema had resolved.
He was also started on afterload reduction with an ACE inhibitor.
In the MICU, his antibiotics were broadened to cover for Pseudomonas in his sputum (with levaquin and ceftazidime) and he was given vancomycin for gram positive cocci from his R toe (which turned out to be MSSA).
He was started on an ACE inhibitor for improved BP control as well as standing nebulizers and steroids for treatment of his COPD.
An insulin gtt was added to better control his hyperglycemia.
Diuresis was continued and his respiratory status improved.
He passed a SBT and was extubated successfully on [**2135-5-1**].
Mr. [**Known lastname **] completed an 8 day course of ceftazidime (along with 7 days of levaquin, for double coverage initially) for the treatment of Pseudomonas ventilator associated pneumonia on [**2135-5-7**].
# COPD: Mr. [**Known lastname **] likely had a COPD exacerbation that contributed to his difficulty in weaning off of the ventilator.
However, he was able to be changed from IV solumedrol to PO prednisone on the floor.
The prednisone taper was started on discharge and his steroids will be slowly tapered over two weeks.
He was continued on standing albuterol and ipratroprium nebulizers as he easily became wheezy with any exertion.
He was also given albuterol inhalers prn.
There was some concern, as [**Known lastname 4030**] above, that his beta-blocker worsened his respiratory status, but the patient seemed to tolerate oral metoprolol without any exacerbation of his COPD.
Given that he was on several antibiotics at the time, there was concern for C diff infection.
He was started on flagyl for empiric treatment of C. diff and cultures were followed.
ID was consulted for advice in the length of treatment for his Pseudomonas pneumonia, as well as advise for the treatment of his R toe.
ID felt that his ceftazidime could be discontinued after 8 days, that levofloxacin was no longer needed for double coverage, and that his R toe did not look infected, so  vancomycin could also be discontinued.
Ceftazidime was completed on [**2135-5-7**] and per ID, Mr. [**Known lastname **] will be continued on flagyl until [**5-10**].
On transfer to the floor, Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 5025**] was continued on telemetry and appeared to have multiple different rhythms, including MAT, sinus tachycardia with ectopic beats (both ventricular and atrial) and ventricular bigeminy.
His attending recommended increasing the beta-blockade if possible, but his blood pressure was on the lower side, so he was maintained on metoprolol 75mg PO TID with adequate rate control.
On admission, there was concern for cellulitis vs. gangrene in his R toe.
MRA showed moderate to severe atherosclerotic disease, but no surgical intervention was planned during this admission due to his tenous respiratory status.
# DM type II: Mr. [**Known lastname **] had been on an insulin gtt in ICU, with labile fingersticks.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted to help control his hyperglycemia in the setting of acute illness and the administration of tube feeds.
His steroid use for his COPD exacerbation and discontinuation of tube feeds likely contributed to the lability of his glycemic control.
He was discharged on glipizide 5mg daily, which is half of his normal home dose, as well as a humalog insulin sliding scale while he is still on prednisone.
His glipizide will be titrated as needed at rehab based on his fingersticks.
# FEN: In the ICU, he had an NGT through which he was given tube feeds.
On transfer to the floor, he was reevaluated by speech and swallow and passed, so he was given  a regular, [**Doctor First Name **], heart healthy diet with thin liquids and soft solids.
# PPX: He received heparin SC for DVT prophylaxis, a PPI for GI prophylaxis, and a bowel regimen prn.
# ACCESS: He had a left subclavian line placed in the ICU on [**2135-4-25**].
He had a PICC line placed in his R forearm [**2135-5-3**] and the SC line was pulled on [**2135-5-4**].
After completion of his antibiotic course, his PICC line was pulled and he was able to have a peripheral IV.
