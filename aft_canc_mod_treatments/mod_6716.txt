HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 72-year- old male with a past medical history notable for coronary artery disease status post PCI in [**2119**], with ongoing chronic angina, Hep-C viral infection without infection of chronic liver disease, gastrointestinal bleed with ulceration complicated by perforation in [**2106**], hypertension, recent urinary tract infection s/p cipro x 10 days, and background history of both emphysema and probable pulmonary fibrosis / IPF.
Based on his presentation, he was treated with IV fluids, antibiotics, IV proton pump inhibition, and Dilaudid for abdominal pain, and subsequently admitted to the medical intensive care unit.
Coronary artery disease status post PCI in [**2119**], with ongoing chronic angina 2.
PUD / gastrointestinal bleed with perforation in [**2106**] 4.
Recent urinary tract infection s/p cipro x 10 days 6.
He also had a history of intravenous drug abuse, specifically morphine and heroin.
Albuterol metered dose inhaler 1-2 puffs every 6 hours     as needed.
Ipratropium metered dose inhaler 1-2 puffs every 8 hours     as needed.
Aspirin 325 mg tablets 1 by mouth daily.
Enalapril 5 mg 1 by mouth daily.
Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg 1 by mouth daily.
Omeprazole 25 mg 1 by mouth daily.
Propranolol 20 mg by mouth twice daily.
Hytrin 2 mg by mouth once daily.
Simvastatin 20 mg by mouth once daily.
Of note, the patient was able to tolerate lasix without complication.
In consultation with GI and Surgery, this was managed conservatively with antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and further examination for possible C. difficile infection or ongoing bowel ischemia, which was felt to be less likely.
He did not require transfusion and did not require colonoscopy or further invasive procedures to evaluate the course of his bleed, which resolved spontaneously.
His AF was eventually brought under control through initiation of Diltiazem first via drip, then via p.o.
His subsequent course over the next several days was marked by progressive respiratory distress, despite aggressive attempts at fluid removal with Lasix.
He was managed with antibiotic therapy, rate control, and diuresis.
The patient developed further respiratory impairment, and after discussing the risks and benefits of steroid therapy in the setting of his GI bleed and ongoing infection with consulting services and with the patient, the decision was made to initiate steroid therapy to treat a component of accelerated idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
In consultation with myself, the patient, and the social worker, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 18741**], it was decided that the patient did not desire aggressive therapy for his progressive respiratory insufficiency.
The natural history of accelerated IPF was explained in detail, including the lack of curative therapy for progressive disease.
We further discussed the patient's desire for aggressive therapy given the poor prognosis associated with the underlying process.
After consideration of the associated risks and benefits, he decided to continue therapy with supplemental oxygen, steroids, and antibiotics as well as medicines for pain and dyspnea.
He specifically did not want therapies including intubation, mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, placement of a feeding tube, or chronic mechanical ventilation.
In the event of a cardiopulmonary arrest, the patient did not want aggressive resuscitation including specifically chest compressions or CPR.
The risks and benefits of these therapies were discussed with him in detail.
He was able to understand the risks and benefits associated with these therapies, and elected to pursue a conservative course of management going forward.
