1) Hypoxic respiratory failure: Differential diagnosis was originally exacerbation of bleomycin induced lung injury, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, as well as atypical pneumoniaa.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] scan showed diffuse alveolar filling and interstitial fibrosis consistent with bleomycin toxicity.
The pneumomediastinum was likely secondary to barotrauma, and resolved with serial CXRs.
She was placed on high dose steroids, then switched to a prednisone taper, for treatment of bleomycin toxicity.
Patient also had an antibiotic course of ceftriaxone and azithromycin, which was stopped once cultures were negative.
She was also on prophylactic doses of TMP-SMX for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
Patient had a surgical tracheostomy placed, with efforts to wean oxygen and perhaps go to rehabilitation.
Cultures were all negative, and patient was originally placed on antibiotics, with blood glucose control and steroids.
Due to her functional neutropenia, she was placed on vancomycin and cefepime.
She was taken off her heparin when she developed thrombocytopenia, and a HIT antibody was checked, and was negative.
She was given a course of neupogen as well, and remained on neutropenic precautions.
Patient was placed on an ISS, and was placed on an insulin drip for better glucose control.
6) F/E/N: Patient received tube feeds.
She had an attempted PEG tube placement but had decreased oxygen saturations during the procedure, and it was aborted.
She then had air under the diaphragm, and tube feeds were held for several days.
7) Ppx: Heparin sc.
PPI since on high-dose steroids .
The subclavian line was changed to an IJ.
She was then made DNR/DNI, and then comfort measures only.
