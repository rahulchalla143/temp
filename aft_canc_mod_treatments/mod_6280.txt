He had been doing well at home until yesterday when he developed shortness of [**Year (4 digits) 1440**] and [**Year (4 digits) **] after receiving PRBC and platelets (with 20mg PO lasix).
His wife reports "decent" urine output after lasix administration.
He was recently started on home oxygen at night but, given his shortness of [**Year (4 digits) 1440**], he used it around the clock with mild relief of his dyspnea.
The patient did not look well clinically and continued to complain of shortness of [**Last Name (LF) 1440**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was placed on BiPAP with improvement in his symptoms.
His ED stay was complicated with a-fib with RVR which was treated with IV fluids and digoxin 0.5mg x1 with improvement in his HR from 140s to 110s.
He was covered broadly with vancomycin, cefepime and levofloxacin in the ED.
Labs pertinent for WBC 2.1 (10% neutrophils, 71% blasts), plt 24, normal renal function, INR 1.7, trop < 0.01, lactate 1.6 and d-dimer 1829.
Patient was weaned off BiPAP and is comfortable and satting well on 4L NC.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Biphenotypic Leukemia - Initially presented with "autoimmune pancytopenia" treated with steroids and IVIG.
Preliminary bone marrow biopsy was suspicious for a biphenotypic leukemia and therapy was initiated with hyperCVAD.
His day 14 marrow showed persistent disease and his regimen was changed to 7+3.
Further chemotherapy was held as he was found to have disseminated fusarium [**Hospital1 2**] in the setting of prolonged neutropenia.
He was ultimately discharged on GM-CSF and daily Ambisome infusions.
While hospitalized he was treated with a 10-day course of decitabine without complications.
Of note he had a complicated admission from ([**Date range (1) 82692**]) with cardiac tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis, pleural effusions s/p thoracentesis for 2.1L [**10-29**].
He was eventually d/c'ed home on [**2157-11-11**] on linezolid to treat VRE.
OTHER PMH: Disseminated Fusarium ([**5-15**]):treated with Ambisome and Voriconazole H/O Hepatitis B (on Lamivudine) S/P appendectomy S/P umbilical hernia repair Atrial fibrillation  Social History: Currently on disability.
The echo findings are suggestive but not diagnostic of pericardial constriction.
Right PICC tip is in the mid-to-lower SVC.
Symptoms developed after transfusion making fluid overload a definite possibility.
Patient was initially covered on broad spec abx and was narrowed to vancomycin (he was also cont' on home ppx).
Given patient's h/o of VRE bacteremia, immunosuppression and longstanding VSE in pl fluid, will treat with vancomycin x 6wks, the course given to patients for empyema/abscess.
Patient also presented with afib with RVR and HR was stabilized with home medications over the course of his stay.
Patient responded to the treatment above and was satting on RA ~72 hours prior to discharge.
WRT to patient's longstanding and frequent reaccumulation of pleural fluid, a discussion with the IP team led to conclusion that patient is not candidate for pleurex given neutropenia and frequent infections, including possible pna currently.
Will need serial thoracentesis for comfort prn SOB.
# ANEMIA, DECREASED HEMATOCRIT - His cell counts have been decreased in the setting of his underlying malignancy, but following his thoracentesis there was a 6 point drop in his hematocrit without CT chest evidence of hemothorax.
He was closely monitored and received 1 unit of packed red cells for that hematocrit, with overall improvement.
At baseline, patient requires frequent transfusions and was subsequently transfused a couple of more times on the BMT service.
Patient tolerated transfusions and was given lasix 20IV post to avoid positive fluid balance.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION - Patient has a history of going into RVR to 140s, doing well since IV fluid resuscitation in the ED.
Patient was restarted on home metop and dilt slowly given low SBP and concern for [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2**], eventually titrated back to home medications with HR in the 80-100 range and SBP in the 90-100 range.
We also continued his Bactrim, Acyclovir prophylaxis with Voriconazole given his history of disseminated Fusarium [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2**].
He is followed closely by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from Oncology and his cycle 3 for chemotherapy has been on hold this admission.
