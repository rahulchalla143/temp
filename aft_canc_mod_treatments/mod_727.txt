The patient was subsequently noted to be hypotensive after the procedure which was refractory to intravenous fluids and necessitated a Medical Intensive Care Unit admission.
He was treated with Stress dose steroids, initially, given his history of pan-hypopituitarism.
The patient was started on Ceftriaxone on [**2134-2-18**], for presumed urosepsis.
His blood pressure subsequently improved, and his Dopamine drip was discontinued on [**2-18**].
On [**2-19**], he was transfused two units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 25.4, was extubated successfully and was transferred to the Floor on [**2-20**].
The patient was continued on Lovenox and his hydrocortisone was decreased to 50 mg intravenous q. eight hours.
He was seen by Vascular Surgery, who recommended direct pressure using a C-arm as well as multiple transfusions to maintain his hematocrits.
Renal cell carcinoma status post left partial nephrectomy in [**2128**].
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass graft times four in [**2128**]; this procedure was complicated by sternal dehiscence, status post partial sternotomy.

He grew out four plus oropharyngeal flora and three plus Gram negative rods.
A sputum culture revealed moderate growth of beta Strep.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 69 male with a history of coronary artery disease, renal cell carcinoma status post left partial nephrectomy, admitted for hypotension in the setting of urosepsis.
Now, he presents with a right groin hematoma and decreasing hematocrit status post right femoral line placement.
We held all anti-platelet and anti-coagulation medications including his Lovenox.
We discussed his hospital management with the Vascular Surgery team who were very loathe to perform surgery on this patient given his multiple co-morbidities.
On the evening of [**2-22**], the patient's hematocrit decreased to 26.6 after two units of packed red blood cells.
Once his hematocrit was stable for 24 hours, he was restarted on his Lovenox.
We continued the amiodarone and added Lopressor for additional rate control.
The patient's primary Cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], was notified that his patient was on the hospital wards, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] agreed with continuation of his medical regimen.
The Endocrine Service recommended adding AndroGel to the patient's regimen once a baseline PSA and prostate examination were obtained.
The patient will be discharged on a Prednisone taper with an eventual dose of 5 mg in the morning and 2.5 mg in the afternoon.
He will continue his calcium supplementation and will be started on AndroGel per the Endocrine Service.
Infectious Disease:  The patient was continued on Ceftriaxone to complete a ten-day course for pneumonia and urosepsis.
