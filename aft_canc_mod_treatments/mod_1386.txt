Past Medical History: Past Oncologic History: [**2171-1-18**]: Diagnosed with Pheo in the setting of hypertension, elevated VMA/metanephrine/catechol, and CT scan showing a right-sided 6 cm mass; Surgical resection at [**Hospital **] Hospital and path unavailable.

[**2191-5-18**]: Briefly on octreotide; discontinued after two cycles due to side effects from lack of significant response based on chromogranin A marker, radiology, and clinical impression.
[**2196-11-17**]: Restarted CVD for progression and received four cycles with interval response.
[**2198-5-18**]: Documented progression on imaging, restarted CVD on [**2198-6-21**].
MR Abd/pelvis  [**4-8**] IMPRESSION: 1.
Overall increase in size of retroperitoneal, mesenteric, and portocaval lymphadenopathy compared with prior, consistent with progression of disease.
His hospital course was complicated by respiratory failure in the setting of aspiration, for which he required ICU-level care.
MRI abdomen showed overall increase in size of retroperitoneal, mesenteric, and portocaval lymphadenopathy compared with prior, consistent with progression of disease.
Patient was evaluted by nutrition service, who recommened soft mechanical diet, thin liquids, and Boost (glucose control) supplements.
# HTN: Titrations in blood pressure medications driven by Endocrine consult service.
Atenolol was added, with the hope to uptitrate atenolol, and downtitrate labetalol in the outptatient setting.
Doxazosin dose increased to 4 mg [**Hospital1 **] during his hospital stay.
Diltiazem was discontinued as this was felt to be contributing to his constipation.
The patient's home oral medications were discontinued.
Outpatient endocrinologist recommended insulin as the most appropriate way to manage his sugars in the face of his progressive disease.
The patient carried a previous history of insulin allergy; this testing was re-peated during his inpatient stay, and found to be negative.
His insulin regimen was adjusted [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recommendation.
He will be discharged home on glargine and a sliding scale (attached).
Patient not currently on active treatment regimen, but will re-visit this at follow up appointment.
# Respiratory failure: On HD9, patient aspirated, and was placed on non-rebreather with SaO2 88%.
Though he was not pulseless, code blue was called for intubation on the floor, [**Location (un) 2452**] fluid was returned on deep broncheal suctioning.
He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and started on broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin/zosyn) given his immunocompromised state.
He was initially treated with ARDS net ventilation; he improved rapidly and was diuresed with Lasix in anticipation of extubation.
He received IVF boluses to maintain CVP >10 and required Vasopressin for pressure support.
He was continued on Vancomycin and Zosyn and his hypotension resolved.
Ileus ultimately resolved with an aggressive bowel regimen, including lactulose, miralax, colace/senna, and dulcolax suppository.
# S/P right forearm fracture: On arrival to the MICU, the cast overlying previous forearm fracture appeaered tight related to edema.
Orthopedics was consulted and removed the cast, replacing it with a volar splint which he will need to wear until follow up with orthopedics on discharge.
# Transitions of care: - Will require continued titration of insulin regimen as he modifies his dietary intake with recovery.
- Will require continued uptitration of atenolol and downtitration of labetalol (patient requests that labetalol dosing be decreased)  Medications on Admission: DILTIAZEM HCL [CARTIA XT] - 180 mg Capsule [**Hospital1 **] DOXAZOSIN - 4 mg Tablet - 1 (One) Tablet(s) by mouth at hs GLIPIZIDE - 10 mg Tablet Extended Rel 24 hr - 1 (One) Tablet(s) by mouth once a day - No Substitution LABETALOL - 200 mg Tablet - 3-3-3 Tablet(s) by mouth METFORMIN -  (Dose adjustment - no new Rx) - 1,000 mg Tablet - 1 (One) Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day   Discharge Medications: 1. doxazosin 4 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).
