Pt was initially referred to OSH with sxs of SOB, orthopnea, and DOE as well as a R thigh abscess at donor saphenous graft site.
US performed @ OSH showed 7cm fluid collection in the right mid thigh, for which he was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn ([**2182-12-26**]).
Pt was on the vascular servive aduring this admission but was being followed by cardiology and diuresed on the floor since [**12-28**] for gross total body fluid overload.
In the SICU, the patient had worsening SOB and hypercapnia that was not responding to diuresis.

2) Subcutaneous tissue edema consistent with cellulitis.
[**2182-12-30**]: Right Noninvasive LE ultrasound There is evidence of extensive subcutaneous infiltration and induration consistent with cellulitis.
In addition, there is a linear tract extending from the superficial surface - corresponding to the scar site that extends to a deeper collection that measures a maximum of 7 x 2 cm.
This superficial collection contains no flow and is not thought to represent a pseudoaneurysm.
[**2183-1-5**]: CTA Chest: There is no CT evidence for pulmonary embolism.
This pulmonary branches demonstrate normal enhancement without filling defects.
There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
There is mild diffuse ground glass opacities as well as septal thickening.
There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with increase in size of both left and right side [**Doctor Last Name 1754**].
In addition, there is mild enlargement of the coronary sinus.
All these findings suggest congestive heart failure.
Congestive heart failure with bibasilar atelectases and moderate pleural effusions.
No evidence for pulmonary embolism.

Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Patient is a 57 year old male with multiple medical comorbidities found to have severe pulmonary hypertension without known cause with hospital course complicated by right heart failure and respiratory failure.
Respiratory Failure: The pt was initially intubated on [**2183-1-2**], for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
The etiology of the respiratory failure was felt to be multifactorial with contributions from fluid overload, PNA, diaphragmatic dysfunction (later diagnosed after intubation) on top of possible baseline chronic pulmonary disease (as pt was tobacco smoker).
The difficulty diuresing was felt to be due to hypotension from [**Month (only) **].
However he remained difficult to wean and on physical examination was found to have parodoxical breathing pattern.
This was further investigated with a bedside US and the pt was found to have a left sided diaphragmatic paralysis resulting in paradoxical motion of the diaphragm.
However several hours after extubation, the pt became short of breath with worsening ventilation by ABG.
This was felt to be due to his diaphragmatic dysfunction and the pt was re-intubated the same day.
Diaphragmatic dysfunction: The pt was not previously not known to have any signficant neuropathy and the dx of diaphragment dysfunction was further investigated.
Unilateral diaphragmatic dysfunction/weakness are usually asymptomatic unless the pt is otherwise comprised (ie with pneumonia and heart failure).
His physical examination was consistent with some amount of lower motor neuron weakness in his right leg, which was found to be fairly severe.
Differential diagnosis includes: peripheral neuropathy affecting the phrenic nerve (diabetes, CIDP, vasculitis, connective tissue disease given + [**Doctor First Name **], possibly motor neuron disease) vs. prior injury during CABG in [**7-29**] (can be injured during cooling) vs. spinal cord injury (C 3,4, 5), less likely given his arms are strong and nutritional deficits causing injury to nerves.
Infectious Disease: The patient arrived at the OSH with suspected cellulitis/abscess at the saphenous donor site on his R medial upper thigh.
Blood cultures from [**12-27**] revealed no growth, but wound cultures grew pan-sensitive serratia marscens.
It was instead felt to be a residual fluid collection from post-op and not pathologically relevant.
Blood cultures from [**12-30**] and [**12-31**] showed no growth.
Although the patient was afebrile and had a normal WBC count since admission, broad-spectrum antibiotics were continued given concern for early sepsis in light of low SVR measured with the swan-ganz catheter and repeated episodes of hypotension.
Potential sources included: (1) a peristent LLL infiltrate that was poorly characterized on CXRs taken throughout the hospital course, possibly representing PNA, (2) peripheral spread from the potential R thigh abscess, and (3) line infection.
The patient developed fever and had increasing WBC to 13.9 on [**1-4**].
Repeat U/S of the R thigh collection revealed a shrinking collection of fluid but persistent cellulitis.
Vascular surgery reiterated their contention that the fluid collection did not represent an abscess.
Sputum gr st from [**1-3**] showed GNR and GPC, but cultures showed no growth.
He was afebrile during the remainder of his MICU stay and his septic physiology (vasodilatory) resolved with continuation of antibiotics.
All of his antibiotics were discontinued on [**1-20**], [**2182**] and he remained afebrile without significant concern for further infection.
Congestive Heart Failure: The pt was transferred from the OSH with initial complaints of SOB and DOE.
However, though pulmonary edema was minimal on CXR upon arrival to CCU, peripheral edema and JVD were still markedly increased.
Diuresis also did not improve heart function as measured by persistent hypotension and requirement for pressor support.
Given the evidence for a diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension (see below) and the clinical picture of right-sided heart failure, the persistent CHF sxs in this patient were attributed to pulmonary hypertension resulting in right-sided heart failure.
Echocardiography from [**12-30**] showed a LVEF of 40-45%, but qualitatively described LV function as mildly depressed with inferior and infero-lateral hypokinesis.
Repeat echocariography on [**1-3**] was not able to assess LV function due to technical considerations.
Although it is possible that some degree of LV dysfunction could also be abetting the CHF picture in this patient, the CCU team considered it to be a secondary concern given the overwhelming evidence for R sided failure.
The pt should continue to be diuresed to achieve a goal of neg 500cc to 1000cc/day until he regained his dry body weight or until his creatinine and/or bicarbonate demonstrated signs of increase.
Cardiac Ischemia: The patient arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] with CEs under threshold levels for acute MI, but by [**1-1**], the patient's troponin reached 0.12.
However his EKGs were not consistent with sigificant ichemic changes.
EKG again showed no significant ST changes and the patient was asymptomatic.
CEs decreased thereafter and daily EKGs thereafter revealed no further ischemia.
After the Trach/PEG, the plavix was not re-started given his prior episode of GI bleed while in the MICU.
Cardiac Rhythm: The patient arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] with a pre-existing diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, which was controlled at home with digoxin and sotalol.
Digoxin was discontinued upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] given a lack of evidence for significant LV pump dysfunction.
Temporary discontinuation of sotalol resulted in episodes of PVCs and occasional runs of SVT.
Primary Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient was initially trasnferred to the CCU for indication of fluid overload and respiratory distress with intention to perform pulmonary artery catheterization to investigate etiology of patient's symptoms.
Once relatively stabilized from a respiratory status, the patient underwent placement of a Swann Ganz catheter which was remarkable for severe pulmonary hypertension: RA 15-20 mmHg (A wave); RV 75/7; PA 75/24, with relatively low PCWP suggesting that the patient's right heart failure on admission was secondary to a primary pulmonary process rather than secondary to left heart failure.
Prior to admission to the CCU the patient has been undergoing aggressive diuresis given evidence of decompensated CHF.
Additionally, blood gas analysis revealed likely a chronic respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis as well as a primary metabolic alkalosis, likely a contraction alkalosis secondary to aggressive diuresis.
It was thought that the patient's metabolic alkalosis was liekly contributing to his impaired respiratory drive and resultant hypercarbic respiratory failure.
In the setting of hypotension it would be expected that the patient's SVR would reflect a state of increased vascular resistance with an elevated SVR.
Given that the patient's SVR was relatively depressed compared to it's expected values, there was additional concern for potential distributive shock, likely secondary to sepsis although the infectious source was not immediately obvious.
As the patient's severe right heart failure appeared to be secondary to a primary pulmonary process, a pulmonary consult was requested.
The patient initially tolerated this treatment well, with peripheral BP remaining stable or increasing.
PAP improved slightly with sildenafil rx, but the PA catheter was removed on [**1-5**] due to concern for a line infection.
Later in his CCU course, the pt developed hypotension and fevers concerning for worsening sepsis/infection.
After careful review of his records, the pulmonary hypertension was thought to be either primary in origin as above or secondary due to LVF.
Prior to his CABG, the pt was known to have signficant CHF with compromised LVEF.
GIB: The pt was maintained on anticoagulation as noted above for his atrial fibrillation during most of his hospital stay.
While in the MICU, the pt had one episode of coffee ground emesis which cleared with NGL.
Given his concern for hemodynamic instability at the time, the anticoagulation was discontinued.
Since that one episode, the pt was also found to have some coffee ground from his OG tube after re-placement of his ETT tube on [**1-20**]'[**82**].
A decision re: re-initiation of anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation should be made after discussion with his PCP and cardiologist as an outpt.
His wound appear to heal well with almost aproxmiation/filling at time of dischage.
Renal: The patient has mild pre-existing CKD, with a baseline Cr of 1.0-1.4.
During this admission, the patient has shown acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely secondary to aggressive diuresis and potentially impaired perfusion given hypotension.
He received a tracheostomy as well as a PEG tube placement on [**2183-1-21**] without complications.
