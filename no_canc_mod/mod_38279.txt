There she was found to have a tight stenosis of the proximal RCA and complete occlusion of the distal RCA.
These lesions were angioplastied and two BMS were placed.
She was also noted to have 80-90% proximal LAD and 60-70% Circ stenoses.
Of note she has been having chest pressure associated with exertion for approximately 1 year.
She denies orthopnea or PND.
By report she does take some pill for lower extremity edema but denies CHF history.
There is a question of a possible CVA or TIA in the past year.
On review of systems, she denies deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.

Has mild forgetfulness at baseline.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Anterior exam CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
GROIN: small oozing from femoral line, no hematoma or bruit EXTREMITIES: No c/c/e.
No femoral bruits.
DP pulses dopplerable b/l SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
HEENT: Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
NECK: Supple with no JVD CARDIAC: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
LUNGS: Severe kyphosis.
No HSM or tenderness.
GROIN: Right groin with mild ecchymosis, no bleeding/ hematoma or bruit noted.
ST segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF and V6 with ST segment depression in the lateral and the anterior precordial leads suggestive of acute injury, probable myocardial infarction.
Poor R wave progression across the precordium - cannot rule out prior anterior myocardial infarction.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had mild plaquing, and a 20% ostial lesion.
It was notable for a cuff adequate for endovascular treatment of this lesion without necessarily involving the LMCA.
The RCA had a thrombotic occlusion of the distal RCA.
There was also a tight calcific lesion noted in the proximal RCA.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial normotension with a central aortic pressure of 128/68, mean 94 mmHg.
Successful PCI to the dRCA lesion with a 3.5x18mm Vision BMS and the pRCA with a 3.5x15mm Vision BMS.
No complications.
Thrombotic lesion in the distal RCA with notable disease in the LAD and LCx as well.
Systemic arterial normotension.
Patient is to remain on aspirin indefinitely and clopidogrel for at least 9-12 months given the setting of an acute MI.
Sinus rhythm.
Q waves in leads III and aVF with deep T wave inversion in the inferior and lateral precordial leads, consistent with an evolving inferior myocardial infarction.
Poor R wave progression in leads V1-V3 suggestive of a prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CXR [**10-24**] FINDINGS: Evaluation is slightly limited due to severe levoscoliosis of the thoracic spine.
There is no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Severe thoracic levoscoliosis, no acute cardiothoracic process.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]F with HTN, macular degeneration, without known CAD with new RCA STEMI s/p BMS x2.
# CAD/RCA STEMI: Presented with RCA STEMI.
Post catheterization EKG demonstrated resolution of the STE but new Q waves in II and AVF.
Echo the following day demonstrated LVEF 35% and depressed RV function.
Her cardiac cath also showed significant CAD of the LAD and circumflex artetries but no intervention was performed.
#Acute Systolic Dysfunction: Has been on lasix 40 mg for lower extremity edema.
She looked mildly hypervolemic but was not actively diuresed as she is likely preload dependent in setting of her RV infarct.
#Hyperlipidemia: had history of HLD and was on pravastatin 20 mg daily.
#Urinary tract infection: Multiple episodes  of urinary incontinance in past 24h since foley removed.
Pt denies incontinence at home.
U/A positive, started on ceftriaxone empirically and culture grew klebsiella in urine, sensitive to ciprofloxacin.
# Dementia.
Transitional issues: 1. consider repeating u/a once antibiotics are finished 2. consider stress test in the future to assess for ischemia given known occlusions 3.
15. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] Senior Healthcare - [**Location (un) 1887**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Coronary artery disease Hypertension ?
CVA [**2119**] Dyslipidemia Atrial fibrillation Macular degeneration Carotid stenosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You had blockages in your left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery which are being treated with medication.
You were also treated for a urinary tract infection while you were in the hospital.
You should take Lisinopril 5mg daily (for your heart failure and high blood pressure).
The heart attack made your heart weak and you may retain extra fluid.
Please weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 91316**] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
Medication Changes: Stop Pravastatin 20mg and start Lipitor 80mg daily (for cholesterol) Stop Diltiazem Stop Prilosec and start Ranitidine (Zantac) 300mg daily (safer medication for heartburn while you are on Plavix) Start ASA and Plavix as above Start Toprol 50mg daily (to take some work load away from your heart) Start Ciprofloxacin 500mg [**Hospital1 **] for 4 more days (urine infection) Start IMDUR 15mg daily (to help with chest pain for blockages in your heart) Start Lisinopril (for weak heart and blood pressure)  Followup Instructions: Cardiology: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 91316**]([**Hospital6 4620**]) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 18278**] Tuesday [**2121-11-11**]:30am -green building #562
