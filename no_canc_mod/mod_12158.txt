Infant born by cesarean section secondary to decelerations.
In utero, noted to have polyhydramnios and duodenal atresia.
At birth, noted to have Downs syndrome features.
The infant was transferred to the [**Hospital3 1810**] for surgical repair of duodenal atresia.
Anterior fontanel normal size, sutures split, palate intact, no macroglossia, positive epicanthal folds, positive Downs facies.
Mild retractions, good breath sounds bilaterally, few scattered crackles.
Abdomen slightly distended, three vessel cord, no hepatosplenomegaly, no masses.
Moderate diffuse hypotonia, positive suck and grasp, unable to elicit Morrow.
The infant was transferred to the [**Hospital3 1810**] for repair of duodenal atresia on [**2196-1-7**].
She went for a primary resection and anastomosis of the duodenal atresia on [**2196-1-19**].
There was serious peritonitis resulting from this event, leading to prolonged bowel rest, generalized systemic illness, and supportive mechanical ventilation for a prolonged period of time.
She was eventually re-fed and escalated to 30 calories of formula, or breast milk when available, without difficulty.
Cardiovascular:  Cardiac evaluation confirmed an ASD and persistent patent ductus arteriosis.
Cardiology wanted to ligate the patent ductus arteriosis given signs of congestive heart failure, poor waking, and persistent right ventricular hypertension.
After chest tube removal on [**2-21**], the infant developed a tension pneumothorax, needled for 60 cc of air with no further reaccumulation on follow-up chest x-rays.
Respiratory:  Had a history of intermittent apnea, bradycardia and desaturations.
The infant also received a seven day course of ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin for presumed urinary tract infection and a sputum culture that was positive for H. flu.
Genitourinary:  Renal ultrasound on [**2196-1-8**], small kidneys bilaterally, mild increase in echogenicity of kidneys bilaterally, and echogenic tubular structure, likely secondary to trisomy 21.
Cardiovascular:  The infant continues to have a soft audible murmur, consistent with atrioseptal defect.
Calories were decreased with weight gain, and the infant is now taking Neosure 28 calories/ounce or breast milk 28 calories/ounce, minimum of 130 cc/kg/day by mouth.
Gastrointestinal:  The infant has had a few episodes of abdominal distention this hospitalization.
KUBs have remained within normal limits, with no pneumatosis, no evidence of obstruction.
The infant has been tolerating feedings without difficulty.
Neurology:  The infant does not meet criteria for head ultrasound.
Immunizations recommended:  Synagis respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) 359**] through [**Month (only) 547**] for infants who meet any of the following three criteria:  (1) Born at less than 32 weeks gestation; (2) Born between 32 and 35 weeks, with plans for day care during respiratory syncytial virus season, with a smoker in the household, or with preschool siblings; or (3) With chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the fall for pre-term infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age, the family and other care givers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
