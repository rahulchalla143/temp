Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: Vitals: T: 99.6  BP: 169/74  RH: 77  RR: 20  O2: 93% RA General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP elevated to angle of jaw, no LAD Lungs: Overall decreased air movement bilaterally with bilateral wheezes.
No rales or rhonchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
CXR [**2171-5-5**]: There are lucencies of the apices consistent with emphysematous change.
Chronic basilar interstitial changes are stable in appearance.
Note is again made of calcification of the aortic knob.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Emphysema, with no acute thoracic pathology.
[**2171-5-7**] ECG: Sinus rhythm with borderline sinus tachycardia.
Prominent inferior lead Q waves are non-diagnostic.
Modest inferior lead ST-T wave changes are non-specific.
Since the previous tracing of same date sinus tachycardia rate is slower, delayed precordial QRS transition pattern is less prominent and inferior lead ST-T wave changes are decreased.
CXR [**2171-5-9**]: IMPRESSION: Bilateral opacifications concerning for pneumonia, unchanged since [**2171-5-7**].
Micro:    RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2171-5-8**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 82-year-old man with medical history significant for COPD, presenting with shortness of breath and likely COPD exacerbation .
# COPD exacerbation/pneumonia:  Patient's symptoms and exam point to likely COPD exacerbation as evidenced by wheezing on exam and low O2 sats with improvement of symptoms with nebulizers.
Of note, patient did have hospitalization in [**2169**] for COPD exacerbation.
The patient did have a leukocystosis, which resolved originally, and the patient was afebrile during his hospitalization.
Chest X-ray showed no sign of infiltrate.
The patient was also started on azythromycin for COPD exacerbation and also in the less likely case of possible pneumonia.
However, on HD 3, the patient developed acute respiratory distress.
He was not seen to aspirate, though his CXR showed new bilateral lower lobe haziness.
Serial CXR showed a worsening left lower lobe infiltrate which was likely the cause for the worsening.
# Indigestion/possible GI bleed: The patient complained that his stomach felt as though he "ate something bad."
His BUN is increased out of proportion to his creatinine, which suggests he may have a mild GI bleed.
Added finasteride 5 mg PO daily for urinary retention.
# Hypertension:  Continued on home regimen of HCTZ 12.5 mg daily, lisinopril 20 mg daily, verapamil 60mg QID until he developed renal failure.
Then lisinopril and HCTZ were held because of acute kidney injury.
The patient will need outpatient follow up for possible GI bleed causing elevated BUN.
