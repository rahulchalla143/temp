Failed outpt management of CHF exacerbation with increase of PO Lasix 60 mg to 120mg.
VNA noted low O2 sats, sent her to [**Hospital 191**] clinic where she had cyanotic lips, and then sent to ED where she was 121/68 p76 and 100% on 4L NC.
CXR consistent with a very large heart, bilateral patchy opacities and L > R pleural effusion; also with BNP 5500 (no baseline) and Cr 2.3 up from 1.7 back in [**4-/2108**], and baseline appears to be mid 1's.
Review of her floor vitals shows progressive decrease in her SBP's from 110's to 90's, reported 70's by the primary team this am, and is 85 on evaluation most recently.
Through her course, she was diuresed as above; ACEi, beta blocker, and Coumadin have been held; echo has just been done this am; CE's have been trended which are only minimally elevated Trop's (0.1-0.11) with negative MB's.
There was also of note a concern for LLL PNA vs atelectasis for which she was given IV Levaquin x1, but this was not continued on the floor (she denies cough, fever, and WBC's are low) .
Coronary artery disease; nuclear stress test in [**1-/2100**] showed fixed inferolateral wall defect.
Chronic diastolic congestive heart faliure (EF 50% on [**8-/2108**] echo, apical akinesis, also 4+ TR at that time but grossly overloaded) -> admitted to CCU [**8-/2108**] with cardiogenic shock 3.

Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) (Final       [**2108-9-12**]):       POSITIVE FOR PNEUMOCYSTIS JIROVECII (CARINII).

The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild basal left ventricular hypertrophy with a suggestion of "burnt out" apical left ventricular hypertrophy and associated aneurysm versus prior apical infarct (1.5 x 1.7 cm apical aneurysm without thrombus seen).
There is a 1.0 cm spheroid/sessile mass (clips [**6-13**]) seen in the LVOT about the anterior mitral annulus which is mixed calcified/non-calcified in appearance (suggestive of atypical caseating mitral annular calcification but tumor is also part of the differential).
There is no LVOT obstruction.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global hypokinesis suggested.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There are filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is no pericardial effusion.
RV size has probably increased with new evidence of volume overload.
The apical aneurysm and overal LVEF are similar (LVEF underestimated on prior report), The LVOT mass was present but is now more prominent (likely due to different angulation rather than major changes).
Again noted is massive enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
Probable bilateral pleural effusions and associated compressive atelectasis is unchanged.
There is mild-to-moderate central vascular engorgement.
There is no new consolidation or pneumothorax.
Atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch is noted.

She was also started on isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine for afterload reduction.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  On HD 5 patient was noted to have increased work of breathing and over sedation.
Blood gas suggested poor ventilation and patient was emergently intubated.
While ventilated patient developed an acute metabolic alkalosis presumably from diuresis and was started on acetazolamide.
Patient's intubation was complicated by abscence of a cuff leak which was assessed by ENT and Pulmonology.
Patient was started on 2 days of decadron with spontaneous development of a cuff leak and extubation, which she tolerated well.
Post-extuabtion patient continued to have hypoxia off of nasal cannula.
PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) 5001**] extubation, BAL was collected and sent for gram stain and culture, which was positive for PCP.
To rule out acute HIV infection, HTLV-[**1-8**] and HIV viral load was sent and was pending at time of discharge.
Pt reported no significant risk factors for HIV infection except for a blood transfusion in [**Country 532**] that happened many years ago.
After 21 day course pt will need to be started on PCP prophylaxis unless etiology of immunodeficiency is determined and reversable .
The presumed etiology was from poor forward flow and increasted out patient diuretic dose.
#AMS: with decreased RR and acidemia requiring intubation on [**9-8**].
likely secondary to taking trazodone 75mg in setting of renal failure.
Stool guiauc was negative and only active bleeding that she had was transient epistaxis.
Hemolysis labs were negative, ferritin elevated likely secondary to acute inflammatory response.
Transitional: - needs f/u for HTLV and HIV viral load and immunodeficiency/anemia work up - INR needs to be checked in 3 days adjust coumadin as needed - bactrim ppx as above - holding lisinopril until [**Last Name (un) **] resolves, should restart as outpt and transition from metoprolol tartrate to metoprolol succinate as well  Medications on Admission: Metoprolol Succinate 25 mg Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr daily  Furosemide 120 mg daily (newly increased from 60mg daily previously) Warfarin 2 mg PO daily Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet qhs prn Calcium Carbonate-Vitamin D3 500 mg(1,250mg) - 400 unit PO BID Trazodone 75 mg qhs prn Lisinopril 5 mg daily nystatin powder  Discharge Medications:   1. warfarin 2 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO Once Daily at 4 PM.
