He was emergently taken to the operating room for fasciotomy with external fixator placement for the left tibial plateau fracture.
He was seen by ophthalmology and ruled to have no evidence of any eye injury.
On [**2156-8-28**] he was seen by podiatry for L distal phalanx fractures of hallux and recommended follow up once discharged.
An MRI showed no definitive results and the asymmetric pupils resolved.
Also Mr [**Known lastname 6358**] continued to have elevated temperatures greater then 102 orally and had fever work ups with blood cultures and urine cultures.
On 97/06 Rheumatology was consulted for question of polyarthritis.
Rheumatology then aspirated his right ankle and right knee which was sent for crystals.
The ankle aspiration had insufficient fluid while the knee showed urate crystals.
Also on [**2156-9-2**] Infectious Disease was consulted for MR. [**Known lastname 69714**] elevated temperatures.
Infectious disease believed that temperatures were due to a flair of gout and recommended treatment of the gout.
With treatment of gout with indomethacin, joint pain began to resolve as did temperatures.

On [**2156-9-29**] Chronic pain was consulted for better control of his pain regimen.
He also started to complain of increasing swelling and pain to the right ankle.
A CT of the right ankle showed no acute condition but and old fracture.
With this information the patient continued to refuse any treatment for gout pain and continued to need high doses of narcotics.
Chronic pain recommended oral sustained and breakthrough pain medication for relief of pain.

After injection Mr. [**Known lastname 6358**] reported decreased pain in his right ankle.
