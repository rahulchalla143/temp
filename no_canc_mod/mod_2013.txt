4 days prior to admission, she was diagnosed with a URI because of cough and fever for one day to 99.0 (initially thought to be PNA, but had a CXR that did not show an opacification) and put on ABx (?
Past Medical History: AD OA spinal stenosis GERD monoclonal paraproteinemia.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Not opening eyes to pain or voice.
No corneal b/l.
no VOR noted.
GRAM STAIN (Final [**2197-11-4**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2197-11-7**]):    NO GROWTH.
FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO VIRUS ISOLATED.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2197-11-7**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2197-11-7**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
Neuroimaging: MRI: No evidence of acute infarcts seen.
No definite signs of chronic cortical infarcts identified.
Moderate to severe changes of small vessel disease seen with moderate cortical atrophy.
Evidence of a medial temporal atrophy particularly on the right side is noted with dilatation of the temporal horns.
EEG ([**2197-11-5**]):  This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of moderate diffuse background slowing and disorganization, with continuous focal attenuation and occasional epileptiform discharges in the left temporal region.
These findings are indicative of potentially epileptogenic focal cortical dysfunction in the left temporal region, possibly structural in origin.
Alternatively, the focal attenuation could represent a postictal pattern.
This is superimposed on moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically nonspecific.
Compared to the prior day's recording, background frequencies have improved slightly, indicating improvement in diffuse cerebral dysfunction, but the left hemisphere remains attenuated, and epileptiform discharges have increased slightly in frequency.

NCHCT ([**2197-11-3**]):  No acute intracranial process with marked sinus opacification, perhaps related to intubation.
Minor non-specific ST segment abnormality.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 74 98 86 382/406 75 33 59    Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman with history of Alzheimer's dementia who presented as an OSH transfer in apparent status epilepticus.
She was loaded with AEDs, intubated and sent to [**Hospital1 18**], where she was worked up for a cause of her seizure.
Her MRI that did not show any acute process.
Then, 12 hours later her alcohol level was 149 when she clearly had not had any access to alcohol.
She was switched to keppra to prevent any med-med reactions and to avoid any possible cognitive slowing [**2-22**] dilantin.
Her EEGs continued to show no seizure activity but she remained very somnolent.
She did require restraints briefly, but has not required mits/wrist restraints in the 24 hours prior to her transfer back to the NH.
We monitored her on telemetry while she was here and there were no events noted.
As a part of a routine work up for a possible stroke, we checked a lipid panel which showed an extremely elevated triglyceride level.
She was given PRN doses of lasix to prevent her 6L positive volume overload from effecting her lungs.
Her oxygenation remained in the mid-90's on NC once extubated, and remained stable from a respiratory standpoint following extubation and tolerated being without a nasal cannula.
She remained afebrile throughout much of her stay, but spiked a fever on the night of [**11-4**] and was pan-cultured.
Her BAL and sputum Cx grew out MRSA and she was continued on vancomycin and other ABx were D/C'd.
However, it was felt that her HCT drop was likely dilutional because she was 6L positive for her LOS and when given some lasix her HCT improved.
# RENAL: unclear Cr baseline, she arrived at a mildly elevated creatinine of 1.2.
# CODE: DNR but okay to remain intubated, confirmed with family.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Life Care Center of [**Location (un) 3320**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Alzheimer's disease Seizure Disorder Osteoarthritis GERD Monoclonal paraproteinemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused, poorly oriented but interactive.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 13253**], You were seen in the hospital because of multiple seizures.
We obtained an MRI of your brain, as well as obtained a lumbar puncture which allowed us to rule out very serious causes of new seizures such as bleeding, stroke, infections, or other such causes.
It is most likely that your seizures are a consequence of longstanding Alzheimer's disease, and this was exacerbated in the setting of an upper respiratory tract infection.
