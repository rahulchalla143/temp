Admission Date:  [**2137-1-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-1-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2104-3-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**] Chief Complaint: Pericardial effusion with early tamponade  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardial tap   History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname 69973**] is a 32 year old man without significant past medical history, with recent upper respiratory febrile illness and SOB that started 10 days prior.
Recently completed a course of oral antibiotics in mid [**Month (only) **] for sinus infection, however he continued to have SOB, productive cough, and fever.
He was diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection and possible pneumonia (?LLL infiltrate), however that diagnosis was in question, and he was treated with moxifloxacin.
He presented to OSH on [**1-16**] with temperature of 103 and worsening pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath.
On bedside echocardiogram was found to have a moderate pericardial effusion 1.2-1.9 cm initially and was treated with Toradol.
He was transferred for further evaluation and on arrival was found to have a large pericardial effusion with early signs of tamponade.
His chest pain is nearly resolved, although continues to have substernal discomfort with deep inspiration.
He has a mildly productive cough of pink sputum.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent unintended weight loss, chills, or nightsweats.
He had no known infectious exposures.
He also denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.

[**2141-1-18**] BCx: NGTD [**1-19**] Influenza DFA: negative [**1-18**] Sputum Cx: respiratory flora  Pericardial fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to large circumferential pericardial effusion with echocardiographic signs of early tamponade.
[**1-18**] REPEAT ECHO: Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %), possibly secondary to tachycardia.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Small echodense residual pericardial effusion.
Resolution of tamponade physiology.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-1-18**], pericardial effusion is smaller and echo signs of tamponade are no longer evident  [**1-18**] CXR: No focal consolidation is identified, but the retrocardiac area is dense and the left hemidiaphragm is indistinct.
Pleural fluid or consolidation at the left base cannot be excluded.
Further evaluation with lateral view or lateral decubitus views should be considered  [**1-19**] REPEAT ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is abnormal septal motion.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
Cine loop #27 demonstrates transient flattening of interventricular septum during inspiration, suggesting ventricular interdependence and analogous to a physical Kussmaul's sign.
The echo findings are therefore suggestive of pericardial constriction.
No evidence of cardiac tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Small residual echodense pericardial effusion.
Echocardiographic findings are strongly suggestive of effusive-constrictive physiology.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2137-1-18**], there is evidence of constrictive physiology.
[**1-20**] CXR: There is a small bilateral pleural effusion.
The lungs are essentially clear with no evidence of consolidation worrisome for infectious process.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is abnormal septal motion and exaggerated transtricuspid respiratory variation suggestive of pericardial constriction.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

# PERICARDIAL EFFUSION: S/P tap and latest ECHO on [**1-21**] does not show reaccumulation of fluid.
Most likely related to viral illness given fevers, myalgias possibly related to flu however swab negative at outside hospital and here.
One BC bottle grew coag neg staph, other cultures negative.
No leukocytosis or fevers.
Pericaridal pain well controlled on indomethecin and colchicine.
Symptoms of pericardial constriction likely r/t inflammation.
# Pneumonia: Noted prior to admission and CXR here showed ?
No further fevers or leukocytosis.
Cough with white sputum which cultured negative.
Using Flonase and nasal irrigation to treat sinus pressure.
# Tachycardia: Sinus, rate 80's-low 100's, related to pain and inflammatory state, and nebs.
# Increased LFT's: Unknown baseline.
Pt states he was tested for Hep C in past after IVDA, was negative.
r/t viral illness vs antibiotics.
No pain with eating or nausea.
If still elevated will consider Hepatitis screen and RUQ ultrasound.
# Sinus pain: some facial tenderness.
)(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Pericarditis and pericardial effusion Left lower lobe pneumonia.
Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You had a fluid collection and inflammation around your heart.
This was probably because of a viral infection.
It appears that you have had a pneumonia in the left side of your heart.
You have been on antibiotics to treat this pneumonia and we will send you home on an antibiotic pill to complete a 7 day course.
Your liver function tests were elevated, this is likely because of a virus but Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] will check them again in 1 week.
Start Cefpodoxime to treat pneumonia 2.
STart Azithromycin to treat pneumonia 3.
