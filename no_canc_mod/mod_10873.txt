History of Present Illness: This is a 62 y/o male with h/o PVD, [**Hospital **] transferred from the cath lab to the CCU for ventricular taccycardia and ventricular fibrillation, s/p cypher stents to the RCA (90%).
In the cath lab the patient was found to have a R dominant system, following  placement of the cypher stent he had multiple episodes of VT/VF.
The patient had been in his usual state of health until about 2 months ago when he began experiencing leg tightness in both calves after walking  a [**1-2**] mile.
On [**2114-5-15**] ABI/PVRs with exercise showed: right lower extremity was triphasic at the femorals only and monphasic below.
On the left, the wave forms were triphasic up to the femorals only and monophasic below.
In terms of his cardiac status, the patient denied any specific cardiac symptom.

Coronary angiography of the right dominant system showed 1 vessel coronary artery disease.
The dominant right coronary artery showed modest disease throughout the vessel including the PDA and the PLB with a 90% mid segment stenosis.
The LAD showed mild disease without a critical lesion.
The LCX also demonstrated no angiographic evidence of flow limiting lesions.
This was treated successfully and final angigoraphy revealed no residual stenosis, no apparent dissection, and normal flow (see PTCA comments).
Ischemia :The patient was maintained on integrillin X 18 hours.
A ACE-i was not initially started because of the patient's period of hypotension in the cath lab.
Renal function: Patient had elevated BUN/Cr 32/1.6 and decreased UOP which responded to IVF.
Disp:*30 Tablet Sustained Release 24HR(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia following RCA stent placement with STEMI   Discharge Condition: Good.
Discharge Instructions: You must contact medical services immediately if you should experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, numbeness, or tingling.
