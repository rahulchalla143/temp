The LAD had a  mid-vessel long 70% stenosis with large and tortuous diagonal branches.
The LCx was proximally chronically occluded with left-to-left collaterals filling the obtuse marginal system.
The RCA had mild luminal irregularities; there was a 100% thrombotic total occlusion of the distal PL.
2) A 2.0 x 12 mm balloon was used as the primary reperfusion therapy for the occlusion, but failed to reestablish stable flow; given severe renal insufficiency and the small territory at risk, further attempts at reperfusion were abandoned (see interventional details).
3) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severe systemic arterial hypertension, with a central aortic pressure of 194/84 mmHg.
[**2166-3-8**] ECHO: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with lateral akinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
An eccentric jet of severe ([**2-23**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

She was found to have an elevated troponin I of 0.13 with an EKG demonstrating ST elevations in inferolateral leads.
In the cath lab, she was found to have a distal full thrombotic occlusion of the distal right posterolateral.
The patient also has mid LAD vessel long 70% stenosis of the mid LAD and a proximally and chronically occluded LCx with left to left collateraols filling from the OM system.
An ECHO demonstrated decreased EF of 45%, with mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with lateral akinesis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation was seen.
An eccentric jet of severe ([**2-23**]+) mitral regurgitation was seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation was seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There was no pericardial effusion.

Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack because of a blockage in your heart artery that brings blood to your heart muscle.
In addition, there are other chronic artery blockages that were found.
START taking clopidogrel (Plavix) to help prevent any further blockages in your arteries 8.
START taking nitrogycerin as needed for chest pain.
Take one tablet under your tongue, wait 5 minutes and take another tablet if the chest pain continues.
Call 911 for chest pain that is not relieved with 2 nitroglycerin tablets.
