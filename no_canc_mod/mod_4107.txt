He was last well 3 days PTA when lifting heavy trash right after lunch at work when he felt acute chest pain that was burning in nature in his sternum that radiated to his back.
It was severe in nature and was relieved with rest after 30 minutes.
He did feel some SOB with this episode and does not remember how long it lasted for.
He had no pain the following day and then 1 day PTA the same pain returned while watching TV and after eating spicy food.
The pain retuned this morning without eating and  was again relieved by drinking milk.
Of note, he states that he does not experience any exercise chest pain and is on his feet and walking all day without problem.
If he walks uphill he does get short of breath but otherwise does not feel limited by his lung capacity.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98 P 85 BP171/83 R 16 O2 97 sat.on RA Patient had an EKG that showed no change from previous EKGs and a normal chest x-ray.
Review of sytems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea, dysphagia or congestion.
Denies cough, chest tightness, or palpitations.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.

The patient performed 5.5 minutes of a modified [**Doctor First Name **] protocol(~4.2 METs) and stopped due to progressive shortness of breath.
This represents a limited exercise tolerance.
In the presence of baseline non-specific ST-T wave changes, there was additional 0.5-1mm of horizontal/slighlydownsloping ST segment depression inferolaterally at peak exercise.
These changes became inverted/biphasic T waves in recovery and returned to baseline by 10 min.
Rhythm was sinus with rare isolated VPBs.
Baseline systolic hypertension with an appropriate/slightly exaggerated exaggerated response to exercise.
IMPRESSION: Limited exercise tolerance due to shortness of breath.
Possible ischemic EKG changes(although are probably nonspecific) in the presence of baseline ST-T abnls.

Slightly dilated left ventricular cavity size, normal left ventricular systolic function, LVEF=60%.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    61 year old man with ESRD s/p right-sided transplant with re-canalization of    RAS.
Now with worsening renal function and possible ascites.
Small amount of free fluid in the perihepatic and right paracolic gutter.
Final Report CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST.
HISTORY: 51-year-old male with end-stage renal disease status post right side transplant with worsening renal function and possible ascites.
FINDINGS: There are tiny bilateral pleural effusions.
There is a 5-mm left lung base nodule (2, 15) which is stable since [**2104**].
Just inferior to the pancreas within the root of the mesentery extending from the inferior portion of the duodenum is extensive fat stranding and edema within the mesentery.
Small bowel loops are normal in caliber and without focal wall thickening.
There is no evidence of free air.
Small amount of free fluid is identified within the perihepatic space (2, 18) and along the right paracolic gutter (2, 70).
Small bowel loops are normal in caliber and without focal wall thickening.
There is no evidence of pneumatosis or free air.
Scattered calcifications in the prostate gland are noted.
A clip within the bladder is unchanged (2, 81).
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions identified.
Increased diffuse sclerosis of the osseous structures are likely related to renal osteodystrophy.
Mesenteric edema extending from the root of the mesentry just inferior to the pancreas adjacent to the duodenum, nonspecific in etiology.
Differential diagnosis includes edema secondary to third spacing or vascular compromise (SMA/SMV thrombosis?
It is unlikely that this represents pancreatitis as the edema and fat stranding are inferior to the pancreatic bed.

Final Report TRANSPLANT RENAL ULTRASOUND  CLINICAL HISTORY: Possible renal artery stenosis.
The transplant kidney measures 13.2 cm, and appears similar in size when compared to the prior examination, without evidence of hydronephrosis or perinephric collection.
There is no tardus-parvus morphology of the waveforms or delayed upstroke to suggest the presence of renal artery stenosis of the transplant kidney.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
No valvular AS.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
Conclusions The left atrium is markedly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate diastolic LV dysfunction with elevated LVEDP.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
[**MD Number(1) 21890**]  PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Acute renal failure, status post renal transplant.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Acute renal failure, status post renal transplant.
INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  This is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease, who is status post renal transplant.
He has a history of acute renal failure and renal artery stenosis of the transplanted renal artery.
He presents again with acute renal failure and suspected renal artery stenosis.
Hard copies of the images were stored in the patient's chart for documentation purposes.
This showed a patent transplant renal artery.
Given that the patient has repeated history of transplant renal artery stenosis, we elected to intervene.
No discrete stenoses was noted.
A 6 x 20 mm [**Location (un) 21892**]     balloon was used to angioplasty within the stent,     however no stenosis was noted.
His EKG showed no difference to prior EKGs and only Troponin T was mildly elevated at 0.05.
#Chest pain: Cardiac problems are less likely because his cardiac enzymes were negative and his second EKG showed no changes.
He underwent stress testing, which was notable for marked reduction in ability to exercise due to SOB but he had normal cardiac perfusion and an echo demonstrating LVEF of 60%.
and second EKG ruled out MI and NSTEMI.
His CP symptoms and history of GERD and Baretts makes relfux the likley cause of his pain, which brought him to the ED.
#Renal disease:Patient was noted to have elevated creatinine from baseline elevation (2.5-3.5).
Also has history of ESRD in his cadaveric transplant kidney.
His FENA on admission was <1% which is suggestive of prerenal azotemia.
He did not report being very dry and had this high creatinine in the setting of high BPs so he was considered also for renal artery stenosis (he is s/p stenting in transplant kidney renal artery).
The team was also worried about chronic kidney rejection and/or glomerular nephropathy from diabetes and longstanding HTN.
Labs showed proetinuria of 30, but his baseline is up near 300.
Renal service followed his admission closely and was advising on BP meds, fluids, and imaging of renal artery.
On imaging he had a renal artery US which showed increased resitance throughout the transplant but no color flow changes in the renal artery.
Also, a vascular surgery consult was ordered to assess for re-stenosis.
He was taken to the OR for renal artery angiongram and possible intervention on 3 different occasions.
Angiogram revealed patency of the renal artery, despite this the vessel was angioplastied.
He developed mild respiratory failure after extubation, had to be put on NIPPV and was transfered to the MICU.
Patient reports a history of SOB with exertion from childhood (he has asthma history but no attacks as adult).
He also commented on abdominal distension and so CT scan was ordered to assess for ascites, which would also be a mechanism for pressure on the diaphragm.
It showed mesenteric edema but no ascitic fluid.
He had an ABG whihc showed chronic respiratory acidosis.
He also had liver panel done to assess for hepatitis reasons for possible ascites, which showed adequate liver function.
His orthopnea was thought to be due to a combination of dCHF, ARF and OSA.
He developed mild hypercarbic respiratory failure after extubation during renal artery angiogram, had to be put on NIPPV and was transfered to the MICU.
He was transfered to the floor on [**8-25**] where he was continued on diuretics and had no more respiratory problems off O2.
#HTN: His HTN was very hard to control while in the hospital, his medications had to be adjusted on several occasions because of SBP up to 200s.
He had no more issues with hyper or hypoglycemia after his NPH adjustment.
#CHF: His last echo showed compensated diastolic heart failure and the echo during this hospitalization showed LVEF of 60% demonstrating adequate compensation.
He did have a slight troponin leak on admission but this was thought to be due to RF.
#Tertiary Hyperparathyroidism: Patient was found to have a persistently high Ca and a high PTH at 355.
