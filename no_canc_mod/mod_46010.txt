Name:  [**Known lastname 1937**],[**Known firstname **]                  Unit No:   [**Numeric Identifier 11737**]  Admission Date:  [**2184-9-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-10-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2124-9-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4709**] Addendum: On Friday prior to discharge, the patient had an acute hct drop from 28 to 22.
This was concerning for bleeding into the PEG site.
Therefore the patient had a CT scan that showed no signs of bleeding.
Given that the patient was on lovenox and there was some blood at the time of the PEG placement, it was thought that there was a small amount of bleeding into the site caused by anticoagulation.
Following the transfusion, the patient had increased hct that remained stable for 24 hours.
The lovenox was held after hct decrease, but should be restarted as the patient is at significant risk for DVT after hip fracture.
No evidence of intra-abdominal hemorrhage, as clinically questioned.
Bilateral lower lobe pulmonary opacities, suspicious for aspiration.
Mesenteric and subcutaneous edema, likely secondary to anasarca in this patient with cirrhosis.
