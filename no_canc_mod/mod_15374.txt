Admission Date:  [**2195-7-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2195-7-11**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88-year-old female with a past medical history of cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, bilateral hip fracture, status post deep venous thrombosis in [**2194-11-2**], nursing home resident who presents after the onset of chest pain which began at 2 a.m. on the morning of admission at her nursing home.
It was not associated with any shortness of breath or diaphoresis.
She was transferred to [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital where electrocardiogram showed elevated ST waves in leads I, aVL, and V2 to V4 with reciprocal depressions in leads II, III, and aVF; which was consistent with an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
During the catheterization she had an episode of ventricular fibrillation arrest and was shocked once with 200 joules which converted her back to a normal sinus rhythm.
There was no further ectopy.
The catheterization showed coronary artery disease with proximal totally occlusion of the left anterior descending artery at first septal and small first diagonal.
A small distal clot was treated with percutaneous coronary intervention and stent.
Also of note, the patient developed a right groin hematoma with catheterization.
The patient was chest pain free.
She denied shortness of breath, palpitations, leg pain, or back pain.
Right femoral fracture in [**2194-10-3**].
Left femoral fracture in [**2194-10-3**].
Status post deep venous thrombosis in [**2194-11-2**] after a hip surgery.
Right shoulder surgery.
No history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, diabetes, or high cholesterol.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was wheelchair bound at baseline.
She had a purple hematoma on her tongue making speech difficult.
No masses or lymphadenopathy.
She had jugular venous pulsation to 8 cm.
No carotid bruits auscultated.
Lung examination revealed scattered crackles heard throughout anterolaterally.
Poor inspiratory effort.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
No hepatic enlargement.
Extremity examination revealed 1+ bilateral edema and 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Her catheterization on [**7-8**] showed a right-dominant system with an occluded proximal left anterior descending artery with total occlusion at first septal and small first diagonal.
There was an initial large clot removed proximally with the Angio-Jet which resulted in small distal embolus.
The right heart catheterization revealed severely depressed cardiac index, severely increased right and left filling pressures, and severe pulmonary hypertension.
The echocardiogram from [**2195-7-8**] revealed an ejection fraction of 25%, a moderately dilated left atrium, and left ventricular cavity size was normal.
Resting wall motion abnormalities included anterior, anterolateral, septal, and apical akinesis.
There was no apical thrombus but could not definitively exclude.
Aortic valve leaflets were mildly thickened.
Mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation.
Trivial pericardial effusion.
(b)  Pump:  She had severe decreased ejection fraction.
Her electrocardiogram had P-R prolongation, right bundle-branch block, and left anterior fascicular block.
She had an episode of ventricular fibrillation arrest in the Catheterization Laboratory.
On the day after admission, it was felt that she had components of congestive heart failure.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient was noted to be in congestive heart failure on the day after admission.
They felt that they no longer wanted her to be a full code, that they were not interested in pursuing anticoagulation with Coumadin as she was a fall risk, and that they wanted to have the patient transferred back to the nursing home where she was prior to admission.
Large acute anterior myocardial infarction with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent to the left anterior descending artery.
Right bundle-branch block.
Coronary artery disease.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Diabetes mellitus.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy and systolic congestive heart failure.
Status post ventricular fibrillation arrest.
as needed (for pain or shortness of breath).
