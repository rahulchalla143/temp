Per the OSH records, presented on [**12-22**] with sudden onset dizziness while sitting down at Bingo.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain though she does experience dyspnea on exertion.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: (-) Diabetes (+) Dyslipidemia TC 180, TG 174, HDL 48, LDL 104 (+) Hypertension .

Mother died at 77 of heart disease.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
ECG [**12-23**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
R wave reversal in leads V1-V2 with Q waves through to lead V6 with ST segment elevation.
Extensive anterior myocardial infarction, probably acute.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had mild diffuse disease.
The LAD had a 100% distal cut-off suggestive of a proximal thrombus with distal embolization.
The RCA had an 80% distal stenosis.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated biventricular filling pressures, with an PCWP a-wave of 37mmHg and an RVEDP of 16 mmHg.
POBA of mid distal LAD with 2mm balloon.
Elevated right- and left-sided filling pressures 3.
Atrial fibrillation.
Since the previous tracing anterior ST segment elevation is less prominent.
Tracing is consistent with evolution of anterior myocardial infarction.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the distal anterior septum and apex.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Normal mitral valve leaflets with no mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Mild distal septal and apical hypokinesis with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Non-diagnostic Q waves in leads I and aVL.
RSR' pattern in lead V1 with ST segment elevation and T wave inversion with R wave regression and ST segment elevation in the remainder of the precordial leads.
Anteroseptal myocardial infarction, age indeterminate.
The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size and there is mild tortuosity of the aorta and brachiocephalic vessels.
Blunting of the left costophrenic angle that could represent pleural fluid or merely thickening.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion.
Sinus rhythm.
ST segment elevation in leads V1-V6 with development of Q waves across the precordium.
Acute anterior myocardial infarction with persistent injury pattern.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2143-12-26**] there is no significant change.

# CORONARIES.
Her risk factors included hypertension and hyperlipidemia with LDL >100 on pravastatin 20mg.
She reports to have had muscle aches on atorvastatin and simvastatin.
She underwent an emergent cardiac catheterization upon arrival and was found to have an occluded LAD lesion which was angiopastied (POBA).
Throughout the hospital stay, after catheterization, patient remained free of chest pain and did not report shortness of breath.
# PUMP: On admission from catheterization lab, patient satting well though noted to have elevated wedge in lab.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated biventricular filling pressures, with an PCWP a-wave of 37mmHg and an RVEDP of 16 mmHg.
Her ECHO showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the distal anterior septum and apex with an LVEF of 45-50%.
On HD2 she received one dose of Lasix 20mg x1 for slight volume overload.
# RHYTHM.
Patient was in atrial fibrillation upon arrival from OSH.
She received a n amiodarone drip which was discontinued on HD2 as atrial fibrillation was felt to be present due to peri-mi setting.
For osteoarthritis and osteopenia patient was continued on home regimen of Salsate and Calcium-Vitamin D.  For GI prophyhlaxis, patient was started on Prilosec.
Patient was discharged home in a hemodynamically stable condition free of chest pain or shortness of breath.
Disp:*30 Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Acute on Chronic systolic Congestive Heart Failure Atrial fibrillation: resolved   Discharge Condition: stable.
Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack that was caused by a blockage in your coronary arteries.
One of these arteries was cleared with a balloon procedure, there are still [**1-23**] other blockages that will need to be treated in the future.
You had atrial fibrillation that occurred during your heart attack, this went away and your heart rhythm is now normal.
New medicines: 1. your Atenolol has been changed to Toprol XL once a day 2.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] if you have any chest pain, trouble breathing, cough, swelling, palpitations, dizziness or any other worrying symptoms.
Please weigh yourself every day and call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] if your weight increases more than 3 pounds in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days.
Please follow a 2000mg sodium diet, information about congestive heart failure was discussed with you on discharge.
