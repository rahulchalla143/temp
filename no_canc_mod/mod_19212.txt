Admission Date:  [**2198-1-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2198-2-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2150-5-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**] Chief Complaint: anemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IVC filter placement and removal PICC placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 39190**] is a 47 year old female with history of CVA with left residual weakness s/p abdominal hysterectomy due to uterine fibroids on [**2197-12-14**] who presented to [**Hospital6 5016**] with HCT 17 and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2198-1-24**] with a diagnosis of hemolytic anemia.
She had been in her usual state of good health until several months ago, when she was noted during routine physicial to have uterine fibroids.
She underwent abdominal hysterectomy on [**2197-12-14**] without complication and per patient with minimal blood loss.
She denied any report of anemia at post-op follow-ups.
She denied any frank vaginal blood loss, melena, back pain, or hematuria during this time.
She does state, however, she had upper respiratory illness secondary to sick contacts in her family household.
Given the concern of hemolytic anemia and potential myeloproliferative disorder, the patient underwent a bone marrow biopsy, which upon initial evaluation was concerning for multiple myeloma.
The patient was initially transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells, however, developed fevers and rigors in that setting, and therefore it was stopped prematurely.
She does note mild headache.
No melena, no hematuria, no vaginal bleeding.
Unclear if any hypercoag work-up, echo ever done; now she has significant weakness on left arm and leg # s/p L3 diskectomy # HTN?
Social History: lives with husband, 3 children smoke: [**4-1**] cig/day X 5 years, stopped during this hospitalization EtOH: rare IVDU: never   Family History: Mother: multiple myeloma diagnosed age 80 Father: prostate ca, died in 40s Sisters: cervical ca died 44; stomach ca died 32   Physical Exam: Gen: NAD, fatigued HEENT: PERRL, Clear OP, MMM, conjunctivae pale NECK: Supple, No cervical, axillary, inguinal LAD, No JVD CV: RR, NL rate.
No HSM EXT: No edema.
Studies: [**1-24**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.
[**1-26**] CTA: IMPRESSION: Findings are consistent with nonobstructive segmental PE involving the right middle lobe lateral segment artery.
Findings consistent with intraparenchymal and subcapsular splenic hematoma with evidence of active extravasation into the hematoma.
4.3-cm hemorrhagic left adnexal cyst.
Further evaluation with ultrasound is suggested once the patient's acute problems have resolved.
[**1-26**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia.
Short P-R interval.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
[**1-27**] FINDINGS: Two fluoroscopic spot images show deployment of an IVC filter, with superior tip seen at the midportion of the L2 vertebral body and the inferior tips seen towards the inferior aspect of the L3 vertebral body.
[**1-28**] CT IMPRESSION: 1) Stable appearance of the spleen with several segmental hypoperfusing regions, most consistent with infarctions (particularly given the lack of trauma history).
2) Arterially hyperenhancing focus in the lateral aspect of the lower pole of the spleen is unchanged from the prior study, arguing against active extravasation.
This focus is felt more likely to relate to a hypervascular lesion such as a hemangioma.
3) Persisting thrombosed right ovarian vein.
4) Approximately 4cm left adnexal cyst, which could be evaluated by pelvic ultrasound on a non-emergent basis.
5) Scattered minimal intrahepatic biliary dilitation of unclear etiology and significance.
6) Large left basilar bleb with associated atelectasis.
[**1-28**] LE US: IMPRESSION: No DVT.
[**1-30**] UE US: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either upper extremity.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
However, the appearance of the spleen is stable with several segmental areas of hypoattenuation most likely consistent with infarction.
4.1 cm left adnexal cyst which could be evaluated by pelvic ultrasound on a nonemergent basis.
Large left basilar bleb and smaller right basilar bleb.
Persistent expansion of the right ovarian vein likely consistent with known thrombosis.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined because of the lack of an adequate tricuspid regurgitation jet.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 39190**] is a 47 y/o F hx CVA age 18 (unclear circumstances) recently s/p abd hysterectomy, likely hypercoaguable state with PE, splenic infarcts and hemolysis thought to be due to mycoplasma.
# Hemolytic anemia: Ms. [**Known lastname 39190**] presented from an outside hospital with a hemolytic anemia of unknown origin.
Mycoplasma infection was considered as the etiology as a family member was recently given that diagnosis and she was Mycoplasma IgM positive at the outside hospital.
Her direct antiglobulin test originally was noted to be positive with a weak IgG antibody in addition to a positive anti-C3 antibody.
She continued to hemolyze as evidenced by her elevated LDH and bilirubin.
ID was consulted and multiple studies were sent including CMV IgG which was positive, CMV IgM was negative, blood smear was negative for parasites.
Serial hematocrits, haptoglobin, retic count, and bilirubin were followed and evidence of hemolysis persisted.
Further work up for non-immune mediated causes of hemolytic anemia included a PNH screen on both peripheral blood and bone marrow biopsy which did not reveal any findings concerning for PNH or consistent with a malignant process.
With regard to the potential causes of this, we feel that it may be secondary to loss of the Rh blood antigen in the setting of a brisk reticulocytosis and recent transfused red cells.
The patient continued to have evidence of hemolysis and therefore in addition to steroids she was treated with rituximab 375 mg/m2, which was given on [**2-7**] and on [**2-12**].
# ID:  As there was concern for mycoplasma infection due to IgM positivity at outside hospital in addition to an infected family member, she was started on azithromycin.
She remained afebrile throughout the hospitalization.
She came to [**Hospital1 **] with a questionable diagnosis of multiple myeloma on bone marrow biopsy.
However, on review of the pathology here it was felt that the marrow was more consistent with increased production of erythroid precursors consistent with hemolytic anemia and NOT consistent with multiple myeloma.
# Bence [**Doctor Last Name **] proteinuria: UPEP was positive for 11% monoclonal free kappa light chains.
A CTA was done which was positive for a nonobstructive segmental PE involving the right middle lobe lateral segment artery.
She was started on heparin that evening, however due to the finding of possible splenic bleed on abdominal CT, the heparin was stopped temporarily.
Lower and upper extremity dopplers were done with no evidence of DVTs.
Echocardiogram was done which showed no ASD or PFO.
A follow up abdominal CT on [**1-28**] showed a stable appearance of the spleen with several segmental hypoperfusing regions, most consistent with infarctions.
A hypercoagulable workup was ordered given her PE and history of CVA of unknown origin.
She remained stable on heparin, satting well with no pleuritic chest pain, and the decision was made to remove IVC filter as she will be on longterm anticoagulation.
She reported some neck pain post procedure which was relieved with Tylenol.
She became therapeutic on coumadin (INR 2.2).
# Splenic infarct: Initial CT showed intraparenchymal and subcapsular splenic hematoma with evidence of active extravasation into the hematoma, follow up CT showed several segmental hypoperfusing regions, most consistent with infarctions.
CT was also notable for hemangioma.
EBV studies show evidence of prior EBV infection.
On [**2-2**] she reported additional abdominal pain in right lower quadrant and left shoulder pain.
She remained pain free after this episode.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia.
On [**2-8**] evening, patient noted to be tachycardic to 150s with change in BP medication.
# Hypertension: She was maintained on amlodipine for BP control.
# FEN:  She was given a regular diet and her electrolytes were repleted as needed.
PICC care supplies, as per Critical care   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Critical Care Systems  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Auto Immune Hemolytic anemia Pulmonary Embolism Splenic infarct/ hemangioma Steroid induced diabetes  Secondary: h/o CVA   Discharge Condition: Stable.
She continues to have a low hematocrit, however this will likely improve over time.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a low hematocrit from auto-immune hemolytic anemia.
We believe the cause of your red cell breakdown has to do with an antibody that your body produced likely in reaction to a viral infection.
If you have any fevers, chills, increasing weakness or fatigue, abdominal pain, shoulder pain, shortness of breath, or bleeding please call your doctor or 911 immediately.
