Admission Date:  [**2108-12-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-12-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2066-9-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine / Lorazepam / Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate / Ondansetron  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Altered Mental Status, Hypoxia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: lumbar puncture CVL placement  History of Present Illness: 42F OSH transer with severe lupus with cryoglobulinemia vasculitis (on Cellcept, Prednisone, recently being tx for a flare), CAD 3VD s/p multiple MI's and stenting (EF 20%) s/p V Fib arrest (date unknown) with AICD, trace MR, chronic pain (on Methadone) that presents altered mental status and hypoxia.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2108-12-21**] for "dehydration and change in mental status".
No fevers, headache.
Initial impression at OSH was that patient potentially had a UTI, and given her poor IV access, was admitted for IVF resusciation via CVL and treated for a UTI with Levaquin 500mg IV.
On [**2108-12-22**] the pt was noted to have 1 episode of hemoptysis and subsequently underwent a non-contrast chest CT that was unrevealing for any infiltrates or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Lungs were noted to have subsegmental atelectasis.
OSH evaluation by Cardiology on [**2108-12-22**] for sinus tachycardia (rate 160-180s) and mild troponin bump (0.4, 0.5), recommended patient be transfused for Hct of 30.
OSH evaluation by Pulmonology on [**2108-12-23**] for hypoxia and question signs of pneumonitis, however at the time the pulmonary team felt the pt to be in decompensated systolic CHF (given CXR finding of pulmomary edema), and recommended diuresis.
At the OSH the patient remained delerious and confused noted to be "rhyming words".
OSH team felt believed some of her symptoms may have been secondary to narcotic and/or benzo withdrwal (as evidence by flushing and diaphoresis) and thus, she was also receiving Morphine IV and Valium q6H.
Given a concern of sepsis in a patient with MS changes and tachycardia the pt was given Vancomycin 1gm IVx1 and Zosyn 3.375mg IVx1 on [**2108-12-23**] (nursing report listed Cefepime 2gm IV however no record seen in med rec).
The pt remained afebrile while at [**Hospital3 **] with all cultures NGTD.
At baseline she cannot walk secondary to severe OA of the hips and vasular ulcers and pressure ulcers of the feet.
She had diarrhea x 2. .
According to the family she did not have fevers, chills, chest pain, difficulty breathing or abdominal pain.
She was not having dysuria but they did notice increased urinary frequency.
She noted discomfort in her left arm but it is unclear whether this was pain or weakness.
visual changes) but no headaches or neck pain.
Since that time her mental status has waxed and waned but she has not been conversant.
She has no recent medication changes with the exception of the addition of a beta blocker.
Past Medical History: # Severe Lupus with cryoglobuinemic vasculitis (Diagnosed [**2101**]), Raynauds with ischemic toes.
- Per [**Hospital1 112**] records, pt has months flares that consist of painful red blotches on hands and feet with diffuse puffiness in hands - [**2101**]: Episode of severe cyanosis of feet.
Cryocrit of 23% - Treated with cyclophosphamide [**2101**] (per report) - [**Date range (3) 84207**]: Admitted to [**Hospital1 112**] for evaluation of ischemic toes.

100% pacing with no interval arrhthmic events.
# Multiorgan Failure secondary to ?pneumonia at [**Hospital1 112**] in [**5-17**] # History of "fluid around the heart" treated at [**Hospital1 1474**] one year ago # Bilateral Avascular Necrosis of Hips [**1-17**] # IgM Monoclonal Gammopathy (reconfirmed [**5-21**] at [**Hospital1 112**]) # HTN # CRI # Anxiety # Chronic Pain on Methadone, Oxycodone.
HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI Neck: Supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Rales at bases bilaterally CV: Tachycardic, S1 S2.
SLEEP: No normal waking or sleep morphologies were seen during this recording.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a tachycardia with an average rate of 121 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to slowing and disorganization of the background rhythm consistent with a moderate encephalopathy.
There were no areas of focal slowing; however, encephalopathies can obscure focal findings.
There were no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures contained in this recording.
Note is made of periods of electrode artifact obscuring the record and a tachycardia with an average rate of 121 bpm.
CSF: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion without tamponade.
Trivial pericardial effusion.
TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2108-12-24**], the degree of tricuspid regurgitation has increased.
A left pacer/defibrillator device has a single lead terminating in atypical ventricular location.
This is likely explained by cardiomegaly resulting in abnormal cardiac position.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Bibasilar interstitial markings are consistent with pulmonary edema, and are worse since [**12-24**].
Bibasilar retrocardiac opacities are also present, likely reflecting some component of atelectasis.
# Altered Mental Status: Per family history this appeared to be delerium of approximately 5 days duration.
Given the patient has a history of stroke per prior [**Hospital6 **] MRI, SLE complications such as cognitive dysfunction, stroke, psychosis remained high in the differential.
A lumbar puncture was performed which did not show evidence of bacterial meningitis.
Rheumatology considered the most likely dx to be cryoglobulinemia and Sjorgrens, rather than SLE.
Patient's mental status improved temporarily without intervention other than empiric abx.
This made CNS vasculitis or SLE cerebritis less likely since patient seemed to improve without high dose steroids.
Psych was consulted for a safe, slow tapering regimen.
Hypoxia corrects with O2, thus hypoxia likely [**1-15**] to V/Q mismatch.
Differential includes airway (Asthma, COPD, although no history of either per prior records), Alveolar (PNA, CHF, pt with clear CXR on [**12-21**] followed by evidence of pulmonary edema following fluid resuscitation at OSH), Vascular (PE).
After admission, pt became tachypneic to 50's, [**Last Name (un) 84208**] [**Doctor Last Name 6056**] pattern, recquired intubation.
Appeared to have flash pulmonary edema.
However, she then became hypoxic and tachypnic again on [**2108-12-27**], required emergent intubation.
PEA Arrests: Patient had 2 PEA arrests on [**2108-12-27**] with unclear etiology.
Concern was for PE vs. MI vs. CVA.
TTE showed worse TR but no evidence of right heart failure/strain to suggest PE.
First episode was immediately after induction for intubation.
# Tachycardia: sinus tachycardia 110s up to 160s with agitation.
DDx for her tachycardia includes agitation, pain, withdrawal, PE, acute systolic CHF with poor forward flow.
Patient improved with sedation and pain control.
This was WNL on presentation, may have been secondary to antibiotics.
# Acute Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: Patient appears to be clinically on exam with evidence of JVP, lungs, lower extremities.
Repeat echo after first PEA arrest showed worsened TR with otherwise similar LVEF.
# Pain Control: The patient was on Methadone 40mg TID and Oxycodone 30mg TID as outpatient.
Not currently taking POs and appeared to have symptoms consistent with withdrawal.
# Foot ulcerations: Pt had longstanding ulcers on feet with tendon necrosis, secondary to underlying vasculitis and Raynauds per prior history.
Patient had 2 PEA arrests and expired on [**2108-12-27**].
