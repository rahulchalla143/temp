Emergency laparotomy on [**2164-1-27**], with resection     of necrotic large bowel.
History of atrial fibrillation and flutter.
History of right inguinal hernia.
Right knee surgery.
He was taken to the operating room on [**2164-1-26**], and had a retroperitoneal approach for his abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with tube graft from the infrarenal side to his aortic bifurcation.
Postoperatively he was noted to be hypotensive and was started on Neo- Synephrine.
Over the course of the evening he had a rising lactate and increasing pressor requirement.
There was concern of some ischemic episode and he was taken emergently to the operating room on [**2164-1-27**], for exploratory laparotomy.
On [**2164-1-28**], his pressor requirement continued to go up and he had a Swan in place which showed elevation of PA numbers.
At this point because of his increasing PA pressures, there was a concern that he may be having a cardiac dysfunction.
His lactate remained elevated at 4, however it did not rise.
A second look was done at the bedside serially of his abdominal contents to see if there are any signs of small bowel ischemia, however upon inspection there were no clear signs of small bowel ischemia.
He also had a stat echo done to evaluate for cardiac function because of his increasing pressor requirement and hypotension.
Upon evaluation of his cardiac echo he was noted to have significant left ventricular dysfunction with very poor ejection fraction indicating that he had a myocardial event.
At this point we discussed with the family that there is significant change in his overall status in that in addition to having some septic physiology he likely was in a cardiogenic shock as well.
He went into rapid atrial fibrillation requiring synchronized cardioversion because of hypotension.
He was noted then to be in ventricular tachycardia and again hypotensive.
During this time he had somewhat stabilized, however was still hypotensive requiring maximal pressors and was on epinephrine drip.
