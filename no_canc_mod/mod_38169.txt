HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, acute renal failure on hemodialysis, MRSA, recently discharged after CLO urosepsis and [**Female First Name (un) **] fungemia in [**2161-3-23**], now admitted with left parotitis, increased white blood cell count and microangiopathic blood smear.
According to referral in ER notes (patient only speaks Russian), patient with a left temporal firm swelling which is warm and tender.
Patient was afebrile at nursing home with stable blood pressure and oxygen sats.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Headache but no mental status change per granddaughter, no rashes.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Klebsiella urosepsis, [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] fungemia, congestive heart failure, acute renal failure now on hemodialysis, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, MRSA, history of right great toe osteo status post amputation in [**2161-1-23**], coronary artery disease, status post MI times two in [**2128**] and [**2138**], increased alkaline phosphatase, atrial fibrillation, status post pacer in [**2155**] for bradycardia, peptic ulcer disease, benign prostatic hypertrophy, history of acoustic neuroma status post benign brain tumor resection in [**2136**] with residual right facial droop.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, thin, Russian speaking male in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Right facial droop, left parotid region erythematous, swollen and firm with no fluctuants.
Oropharynx clear, no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Faint peripheral pulses.
Skin, scattered areas of erythema on the legs and erythematous patches on the soles of the feet and toes, non blanching.
CT of the neck showed enlarged left parotid gland associated prominently with lymphadenopathy, airway intact.
IMPRESSION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with CAD, CHF, status post Klebsiella and [**Female First Name (un) **] sepsis in [**2161-3-23**], now admitted with left parotitis.
It was decided to take patient to MICU this evening secondary to new onset of bilateral pulmonary crackles on exam which previously had been clear to auscultation bilaterally.
The patient was believed to be in septic shock and therefore was maintained on a complete course of Vancomycin times 14 days and Meropenem times 14 days.
The source for the hypotension was never identified initially.
Initially it was believed to be secondary to septic shock.
[**Name2 (NI) **] other sources of infection were ever identified.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound and LFTs were within normal limits except for an isolated, elevated alkaline phosphatase.
CT was unable to be completed to look for abscess formation secondary to patient's instability.
On [**2161-5-2**] it was decided that patient was not hemodialysis dependent.
Issues that patient did develop were oliguria and ultimately anuria prior to expiration.
The patient became very fluid overloaded and unresponsive to high dose diuresis including Lasix 160 mg IV bid and q d Zaroxolyn.
The renal team continued to follow patient but did not feel that patient was any longer a candidate for hemodialysis given severely decompensated state.
Pulmonary:  Patient with CHF evident on chest x-ray.
The patient's respiratory status decreased throughout hospital stay with slowly rising PCO2 and bilateral pleural effusion.
A thoracentesis was done to tap patient's left sided pleural effusion which revealed a transudate consistent with congestive heart failure.
Therefore, a transthoracic echo was repeated which revealed an EF of 60-70%, possibly diastolic dysfunction, RV dilation and systolic dysfunction.
Fluids, Electrolytes & Nutrition:  As above, patient with significant hypervolemia.
