Admission Date:  [**2179-2-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-3-10**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**] Chief Complaint: Back pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC placement CT-guided FNA biopsy of vertebral disc Left knee arthrocentesis Left knee arthrotomy, irrigation and debridemen with complete synovectomy and replacement of tibial liner component  History of Present Illness: The patient is an 86 year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, elevated PSA with recent prostate biopsywho was transferred from [**Hospital3 1280**] with a diagnosis of septic diskitis at T9-T10 and enterococcal bacteremia.
Several days later, he developed acute back pain when he attempted to rise from his bed and had difficutly standing.
The pain spread across his back and radiated down his leg.
He describes the pain as sharp, and was relieved by "pain pills."
He notes that the pain has migrated between his back and various LE joints (bilaterally) since the pain began.
He has had a low grade temp and elevated ESR at 150.
MRI revealed increased T2 signal disc T9-T10, CT guided bx revealed no evidence of malignancy or infection, and cultures were negative.
Initial blood cultures were negative, but on fourth day 1 bottle grew enterococcus Patient had initially been treated with levofloxacin, then was changed to vancomycin when enterococcus grew from culture.
The patient has had significant pain requiring narcotics.
At the outside hospital the patient was also found to be in renal failure with creatinine 2.5. .
Evaluation at outside hospital: - Abdominal CT without contrast: no AAA, extensive degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine - Bone scan [**2-19**]: DJD - MRI; enhancement of the T9-10 disk, suspicious for diskitis - CK normal (concern for possible rhabdomyolysis after recent statin use) - Renal U/S (limited exam)-2.6cm parapelvic cyst at upper pole of R kidney.
No hydro or nephrolithiasis  Past Medical History: - Coronary artery disease with Left bundle branch block suggestive of old MI - Hypercholesterolemia-started on pravastatin approx.
2 months ago, discontinued after several weeks secondary to myalgias and weakness.
- Hypertension - Elevated PSA - Prostate nodule with recent biopsy approx.
Neck: Supple, no LAD, no thyromegaly Cor: Tachycardic, regular rhythm, 2/6 systolic murmur best appreciated at the R sternal border, radiating to the clavicles Lungs: R lung CTA, L lung with focal crackles in L base, with occasional expiratory wheeze Abd: Soft, NT, ND, no organomegaly Rectal: Normal tone, no saddle anesthesia Ext: WWP, 1+ pitting edema in feet and shins bilaterally.
Well-healed surgical scars over both knees.
Left knee is erythematous, warm, swollen with extensive swelling of the pre-patellar bursa.
MRI of T Spine [**2179-3-1**]: Signal within the disc space on the T2- and STIR-weighted sequences at T9-10 consistent with discitis at this level.
MRI of L Spine [**2179-3-3**]: There is a focus of abnormal signal intensity in the left anterior aspect of the L4/5 disk and a small area of diskitis cannot be completely excluded, although the typical soft tissue and marrow abnormalities are absent.
There is severe stenosis of the spinal canal at L5/S1 from a disk bulge, disk space and facet osteophytes and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy.
There is severe stenosis of the left foramen.
Milder stenosis is seen at L3/4 and L4/5.
No masses or vegetations see.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 23000**] presented with weakness for several weeks, with subsequent development of sudden severe back pain radiating down his legs.
The back pain was located in the lumbar area.
MRI shows enhancement of T9-10 disk space, T4-5 space, and severe stenosis at L5-S1.
L knee washed-out and liner replaced by ortho for suspected infection.
Back Pain and Weakness: MRI of T spine at [**Hospital3 1280**] had revealed abnormal enhancement of the T9-10 disk space, consistent with diskitis.
However, the patient reported that MRI of L spine showed severe stenosis at L5-S1, the level of the patient's back pain.
Also on MRI, there is abnormal enhancement of T9-10 and L4-5, which possibly represents diskitis.
FNA of T spine lesion has not yielded any organism, although infection probably can't be excluded as patient had been treated with antibiotics for more than a week when biopsies were taken.
Overall, the patient's LE weakness has been improving.
It is likely related to stenosis as L5-S1.
Ortho-spine consultant recommends continued PO pain medications for now, with possible epidural steroids in future once infections resolved.
Diskitis/bacteremia: At [**Hospital3 1280**], 1 of 4 bottles from a blood culture grew enterococcus after several days.
As the patient is allergic to penecillins (unknown type of rash 50 years ago), he was started on vancomycin at the outside hospital for enterococcus bacteremia.
It was unclear if the bacteremia was related to the diskitis, as only one of four bottles grew organisms, and therefore a work-up for other sources was undertaken, including TTE/TEE (no vegetations seen), chest x-ray, urine culture.
The patient had also recently had a prostate biopsy approx.
ID was consulted for recommendations for therapy.
Allergy was consulted who gave recommendations for desensitization protocol, which patient underwent in the ICU overnight with no complications.
L knee swelling: On admission, the patient's L knee was red and warm with significant swelling.
There was marked swelling of the pre-patellar bursa.
Ortho consulted and performed arthrocentesis, which had a leukocytosis but no organisms (though patient on antibiotics).
Pain control: Initially on morphine PCA, then switched to tylenol with oxycodone as needed.
No NSAIDs given renal function.
Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
no signs of active bleeding.
