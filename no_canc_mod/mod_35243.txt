The ascending aorta is markedly dilated A mobile density is seen in the ascending aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection.
A mobile density is seen in the aortic arch consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection.
A mobile density is seen in the descending aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection.
Mild to moderate ([**1-13**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**Known firstname 34699**] [**Known lastname 7474**] at 13:40  Post_Bypass: Milrinone 0.5 mcg/kg/min, epinephrine 0.05mcg/kg/min  Left ventricle has very severe dysfunction less than 5% EF.
Right ventricle has severe dysfunction.
Taken to the OR for TEE where he was severely acidotic, with a mixed venous sat of 15.Echo showed poor cardiac function, and he was hypoxic.
Decision made for surgical salvage attempt, and he underwent emergency replacement of ascending and hemi arch aorta/AVR.Unable to be weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass, despite maximal pressor support, bronchoscopy and pulmonary consult.
