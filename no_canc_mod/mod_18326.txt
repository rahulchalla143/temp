Her surgery was complicated by a sternal wound infection requiring multiple courses of antibiotics and three surgical sternal debridements.
Patient did present for cardiac surgery evaluation as well due to sternal involvement.
Her echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, no mitral regurgitation, and normal pulmonary artery pressures.
The patient also underwent a preoperative stress test, which showed no inducible ischemia and good exercise tolerance.
Her cultures from the sternal wound and tissue reviewed coag-negative Staph and the patient has been continued on IV Vancomycin for this.
Her drains remained in for a number of days due to continued drainage.
On postoperative day four, her TSH was checked and found to be elevated and her Synthroid was increased to 100 mcg at that time.
On postoperative day four, Hematology consult was obtained due to persistent leukopenia with a white cell count in the 2.6 to 4.9 range.
It was their recommendation to check peripheral smears, and folate, and B12 levels and continue to follow her TSH and these are all issues that need to be continued to be addressed as the patient was discharged from rehabilitation facility.
Patient has had fluctuating blood glucose levels high in the 170s, but low in the 40s-50s.
Her incision is clean and healing well with no erythema or drainage.
She has no peripheral edema.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient also needs to be followed up as an outpatient for her leukopenia through her primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] she should also be monitored for her thyroid replacement and have another TSH level checked in approximately four more weeks since her Synthroid was recently increased to 100 mcg.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Postoperative sternal wound infection status post sternal wound debridement and pectoral flaps.
