Admission Date:  [**2101-11-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2101-12-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2030-2-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Anesthesia Tray  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Thoracentesis bilaterally   History of Present Illness: 71yo female with a past medical history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Ankylosing Spondylitis, HTN, h/o DVT, and recent admission with new onset bilateral lower extremity paralysis s/p fall was admitted from her rehab with worsened shortness of breath.
Per report from rehab, patient has had persistent shortness of breath since admission to rehab, and over the last 2-3 days, patient was found to have increasing shortness of breath with tachypnea.
After her fall, she gradually developed lower extremity paralysis and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
MRI demonstrated T11-T12 cord compression and she was taken for T8-L2 posterior spinal fusion with T11 laminectomy.
Her post-operative course was complicated by the following: - atrial fibrillation with tachycardia with adequate control with metoprolol - bilateral pleural effusions - This was thought related to severe atelectasis and was treated with aggressive chest PT.
- h/o DVT - patient has a history of DVT and had an IVC filter placed.
- C. diff - diagnosed wtih C.diff and started on flagyl - UTI - Enterococcus UTI and started on amoxicillin - Acute Renal Failure - Creatinine peaked to 1.9 during previous admission .
Labs were notable for creatinine of 1.2 (baseline 1-1.2), potassium 5.7, troponin elevated to .08, and BNP elevated to 8506.
ECG was notable for atrial fibrillation with no acute ST changes.
CXR was also remarkable for left pleural effusion that has increased in size and a moderate right sided pleural effusion as well.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient reports feeling generally well with improvement in her shortness of breath.

There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.

There is no pericardial effusion.
Complete opacification of the left hemithorax suggesting large pleural effusion and/or atelectasis.
[**2101-12-9**] CXR  Increasing large left-sided pleural effusion could be secondary to change in position of left upper quadrant pigtail catheter  [**2101-12-13**] CXR  In comparison with study of [**12-12**], there is removal of the left chest tube.
No acute focal pneumonia has developed in the interval.

Inferior and lateral ST-T wave changes are non-specific.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2101-12-7**] poor R wave progression is not seen on the current tracing and there are more ventricular premature beats.
INPATIENT  Brief Hospital Course: 71F with bilateral lower extremity paralysis s/p fall, anklyosing spondylitis, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and h/o DVT p/w three days of worsening dyspnea.
# Dyspnea: Patient was intermittently dyspneic after admission but generally was not hypoxic.
The etiology of her dyspnea was thought to be mixed, with her large bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary edema secondary to hypoalbuminemia, obesity, and mucous plugging all contributing.
The pleural fluid was a transudate by Light's criteria and the gram stain and culture were negative.
She was transferred back to the medical floor on [**11-15**] and continued to do well from a respiratory perspective.
She had episodes of dyspnea with exertion when being moved in bed but consistently kept an oxygen saturation >90% and was never tachypneic.
She was aggressively diuresed because of anasarca, likely secondary to hypoalbuminemia and IVF administration during her prior admission while on the surgical service, and was negaative three to five liters each day for the first five days after being transferred to the floor.
For several days preceeding day of d/c she was had no difficulty breathing and stated that her lungs felt clear.
# Anasarca:  The patient was severely volume overloaded, likely secondary to hypoalbuminemia and IVF administration during her prior admission while on the surgical service, and was diuresed aggressively with marked improvement, as described above.
# Lower extremity paralysis: Patient was recently discharged after being admitted for LE paralysis which occured in the setting of a traumatic fall, spinal compression fractures, and an epidural hematoma.
She also was managed with other prophylactic treatments for her SCI, including repositioning in bed q2h to decrease her risk of bed sores and intermittent straight cathing to decrease her risk of UTI (compared to the risk associated with an indwelling catheter).
She was treated for one E.coli UTI and then had a foley change for enterococcus colonization.
She initially had a spinal wound dehiscence which ortho spine commented on and did not think was a new surgical issue though it was initially draining large amounts of serosanguinous fluid.
The wound dehisence mostly sealed over the course of this admission.
# Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Patient was maintained on an ISS and had a HbA1C<7%.
# UTI:  The patient had a urine culture that grew E. coli sensitive to bactrim, gentamicin, and zosyn.
Because her renal function was normal, a transtubular potassium gradient was calculated and found to be 4.3%, consistent with hypoaldosteronism.
She was discharged without the foley, but with [**Month/Year (2) 7219**] for q4h timed voids (straight caths) because of the decreased risk of UTI associated with this method, when compared to indwelling catheters.
# C diff:  Patient had diarrhea and positive c diff toxin during her prior hospitalization and was continued on flagyl.
Her two week course was completed on [**2101-11-13**] but then restarted shortly afteward because of recurrence of loose stools.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Patient has a CHADS score of 2 and aspirin will be adequate for long-term thromboembolic ppx, though she may be anticoagulated with warfarin indefinitely considering that her DVT was likely idiopathic in etiology.
Her metoprolol was uptitrated to 100mg [**Hospital1 **] because she continued to have HR around 100, and she was also monitored on telemetry.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 1121**] - [**Location (un) 1456**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pleural effusion Spinal Cord Injury  Secondary: Deep Vein Thrombosis Atrial Fibrillation Morbid Obesity Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Diabetes Mellitus Type II   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath.
We transferred you to the intensive care unit because you were having difficulty breathing.
On the medical floor, we also treated you for swelling related to excess fluid, a urinary tract infection, and the clots you developed in your legs several months ago.
You had fluid on your lungs and so we used tubes to drain this fluid.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you experience fevers, chills, sweats, chest pain, shortness of breath or anything else of concern.
