Admission Date:  [**2149-9-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2149-10-2**]   Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Demerol / Codeine / Percocet / Darvocet-N 50 / Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1556**] Chief Complaint: s/p Fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 85 yo female with multiple medical problems include recent stroke, [**Name (NI) 7792**] s/p with fall at [**Hospital3 **] facility, found down, +LOC, doesn't recall details of fall.
Past Medical History: Type II DM HTN Hypothyroid H/o TIA Ehrlos Danlos  Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use.
Family History: Family history of Ehrlos Danlos.
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Physical Exam: Upon exam: Gen: In hard collar HEENT: significant swelling and ecchymosis R face, R eye, bleeding cut near R eye Extrem: Warm and well-perfused.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
There is a small amount of blood layering dependently in bilateral lateral ventricular occipital horns and atria, more represent interval redistribution of blood, rather than true additional hemorrhage.
There is no edema, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
Multifocal low attenuation in the bilateral periventricular and subcortical white matter, unchanged, likely represent chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
Again is noted mucosal thickening in bilateral ethmoid air cells and air-fluid level in the right sphenoid sinus.
There is persistent swelling in the right periorbital region.
The known right zygomatic arch fracture is only partially visualized.
Slight reduction in size of the right lateral ventricular thrombus, likely adherent to choroid plexus, with some blood in the bilateral occipital horns and atria, likely representing redistribution of intraventricular hemorrhage rather than interval progression.
Persistent opacification of bilateral ethmoid air cells and air-fluid level in the right sphenoid sinus.
The known facial fractures are not completely visualized on the current study.
Unchanged periorbital soft tissue swelling and preseptal thickening.
Repeat head CT scan - [**2149-9-29**] NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Compared to prior exam, right intraventricular hematoma is minimally decreased in size.
Small amount of blood is seen layering in the dependent portions of the lateral ventricle, unchanged.
No new focus of hemorrhage is identified.
There is no hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structure or evidence of major [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] territorial infarct.
Hypodensities in the periventricular and subcortical white matter reflect chronic microvascular ischemic change.
The cavernous carotid show atherosclerotic calcification.
Again noted are ethmoid mucosal thickeninge, air-fluid level in the right sphenoid sinus and complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus.
Right- sided facial fractures are better evaluated on dedicated CT from [**2149-9-27**].
IMPRESSION: Compared to prior exam from [**2149-9-28**], there is minimally decreased size of right intraventricular hematoma.
Small amount of blood layering within the dependent portion of the ventricle is unchanged.
No new hemorrhage is identified.
[**2149-9-27**]  CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXIL  FINDINGS: Marked right-sided facial swelling and preseptal swelling has been evident.
There is a depressed fracture involving the lateral wall of the right maxillary sinus by approximately 3 mm.
There are several comminuted fractures of the lateral wall as well.
An inferior maxillary sinus fracture is also evident.
Comminuted fracture involving the medial wall of the maxillary sinus is noted.
Hemorrhage and foci of emphysema fill the right maxillary sinus.
A comminuted fracture also involves the superior wall of the maxillary sinus.
A small amount of high-attenuation material is also noted within the right sphenoid sinus and may indicate extension of right-sided facial fractures into the level of the sphenoid sinus.
An acute fracture of the right zygomatic arch is again noted.
No left-sided facial fractures are identified.
IMPRESSION: Right -sided facial fractures with hemorrhage filling the right maxillary sinus and extending into the right ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses.
Fractures involving all walls of the maxillary sinus, including the inferior orbital wall.
There is no evidence of muscle entrapement but right inferior rectus is thicked indicating trauma.
There were no new areas of intracranial hemorrhage noted on repeat scans.
She has a known history of hypertension and has been on several medications to control this.
Social work was consulted for patient and family emotional support.
Olanzapine 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6PM: hold for increased sedation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 5481**]  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p Fall Maxillary sinus fracture Inferior orbital wall fracture Intraventricular head bleed Coagulopathy secondary to elevated INR   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, pain adequately controlled   Discharge Instructions: AVOID any anticoagulants (except for Heparin SQ) until follow up in 2 weeks with Neurosurgery.
Inform the office that you will need a repeat head CT scan for this appointment.
