Per patient, he has chest pain although not reliably with exertion that is usually relieved with one nitro.
On Friday night he had his usual chest pain but it was not relieved with nitro.
This pain was associated with SOB.
EKG showed NSR with rate 75bpm, 1st degree AVB with IVCD and 1mm ST depression in lateral aspect with no change from prior EKGs.
On admission he also had SOB and CXR that was reportedly consistenet with CHF as well as mildly elevated BNP (627).
He was given 40mg IV lasix and was admitted for ROMI and CHF exacerbation.
The next day the patient underwent a nuclear stress test that showed diffuse ST depressions II, III, aVF, V4-V6.
He was not treated with plavix because of concern for three vessel disease and potential cardiac surgery.
Last cath ([**2181**] at [**Hospital1 2177**]) showed patent grafts and 60% stenosis in SVG to OM2 which was not intervened upon.
He was evaluated with MR of the spine at the OSH for h/o severe spinal stenosis and right-sided radiculopathy.
There was consideration for epidural injection, however, because of the cardiac issues this was deferred.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right dominant system with severe three vessel disease.
The LAD had a 100% mid vessel occlusion with diffuse disease.
The SVG to OM2 had a 90% stenosis at the distal anastamosis.
The LIMA-LAD could not be selectively engaged because of subclavian tortuosity.
SVG-OM2 with 90% stenosis in the distal anastamosis.
(reportedly), in [**2181**] anatomy as follows: patent grafts, 60% distal stenosis in the SVG to Om2- medical, mangement continued.

Sclera anicteric.
[**2-17**] SM RUSB->axilla and carotids Chest:  CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
Hematoma in right groin, non-pulsatile, dressing C/D/I Ext: No edema.
Confused at times (which is baseline) .
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system  revealed severe left main plus three vessel native coronary artery disease.
The SVG-OM1 had a occlusion in the native OM1 distal to a previously placed stent.
The SVG-OM2 had a 50% stenosis in the proximal portion of the graft.
Nonselective angiography of the LIMA demonstrated a tubular 50-60% stenosis in the mid LAD.
Failed attempt to close the right femoral arteriotomy site with a Perclose closure device - manual compression applied.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior and inferolateral segments.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction.
Mild calcific aortic valve stenosis.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2181-2-2**], lateral wall hypokinesis is not seen on the current study.
Aortic stenosis is seen on the current study.
[**3-10**] CT head: No acute intracranial process.
Moderate age-appropriate diffuse cerebral atrophy.
[**3-14**] CXR- .
There is no pneumothorax and no pleural effusion.
No residual flow.
Persistent hematoma in the right groin, slightly smaller than previously.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 M with CAD s/p CABG (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM1, SVG-OM2, SVG-PDA) and DES to OM2 in [**2180**] admitted for NSTEMI and had subsequent unsucessful PCI on the native OM2.
Course marked by symtomatic bradycardia and chest pain with hypertension.
CAD: Cath showed stenosis at end of stent in OM2 that was unable to be intervened upon.
Patient continued to have episodes of chest pain associated with elevated BPs and lateral ST depressions on EKG.
This would resolve with BP control and the EKG changes would come down to baseline, his last episode of chest pain was on [**2186-3-11**].
However, with increase of beta blocker, the patient had onset of bradycardia with some pauses as long as 6 seconds so the beta blocker had to be discontinued.
He was transferred to the CCU for better monitoring given the long pauses and chest pain associated with HTN.
Patient did not have chest pain after [**3-11**], he reported no dyspnea on exertion.
Sick sinus syndrome: Patient was hypertensive necessitating increase of his beta blocker.
This resulted in bradycardia with pauses on telemetry up to 6 seconds.
LVEF 55% reportedly on TTE at OSH but did have symptoms of CHF requiring diuresis.
Repeat ECHO on [**3-9**] showed 55-60% EF, mild regional left systolic disfunction with hypokinesis of the bassal or mid inferior inferolateral segments.
After [**3-9**] he remained euvolemic on exam and did not require further diuresis or oxygen.
# Aortic stenosis.
It was thought that his chest pain may in part be causing angina and SOB.
Repeat TTE on [**3-9**] showed a moderate AS (*1.3 cm2) so it was thought more likely that the chest pain was from his CAD not the AS.
As patient was euvolemic and other BP medications were titrated up it was decided not to re-start the HCTZ.
# HTN.
# Spinal Stenosis: Patient was evaluated at OSH for possibility of epidural block.
Pain was well controlled with Acetaminophen 650 mg QID standing.
# Dementia.
He was discharged in a hemodynamically stable condition, free of chest pain.
He will require optimization of antihypertensive regimen, blood glucose control and follow up of his pain control.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Bostonian - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: NSTEMI, Moderate AS, Sick sinus syndrome, Hypertensive emergency  Secondary: HTN, CAD, DM2, CKD, Depression, Dementia, Spinal stenosis   Discharge Condition: The patient was afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and chest pain free prior to discharge.
You had a cardiac catheterization that showed that you have a blockage.
Due to inability to intervene with catheterization, your pain was treated medically.
Should you experience further chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, faintness, severe weakness or any other symptom concerning to you, please call the doctor at your rehabilitation facility or go to the emergency room.
