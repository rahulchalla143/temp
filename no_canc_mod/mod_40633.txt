Also in [**Name (NI) **] pt became Hypoxemic, requiring NRB with SaO2 98%.
Repeat CXR showed mild worsening of congestion.

Pulmonary edema has resolved since [**2203-10-11**].
Right lower lung opacities have increased since previous exam.
It could be due to atelectasis and lower lung volume; however, aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Right bundle-branch block.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is no pericardial effusion.
# Atrial Fibrillation with Bradycardia: Afib is paroxysmal.
Etiologies include new medications (recent addition of Metoprolol), MI (no s/s on EKG and neg enzymes), Infection (no fever, +leukocytosis), metabolic disturbances (electrolytes wnl).
Dronedarone stoppped due to CHF and QTc.
# Non Respiratory Dependent Hypoxemic Respiratory Distress: Pt required NRB in ED and in CCU for < 24 hours.
Crackles appreciated 1/2 up B/L and CXR consistent with pulmonary edema.
We continued diuresis with significant improvement.
Patient with some crackles continued, CXR that showed small/moderate R pleural effusion and only mild interstial edema.
Likely component of chronic fibrosis [**2-17**] amiodarone.
CXR on day of discharge showed improved pulm edema and increased RLL atelectasis vs. pneumonia.
Chronic Issues: # CAD with RCA stent in [**2191**]: Asymptomatic.
We continued ASA 81, Atorva 20, EKGs were trended, Echo repeated and showed EF 55%, and severe TR.
# Constipation - noted to be a problem at her last outpatient visit.
Nitroglycerin SL 0.4 mg SL PRN chest pain 6.
Nitroglycerin SL 0.4 mg SL PRN chest pain   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Last Name (un) 1687**] House  Discharge Diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation with bradycardia Acute on Chronic Diastolic congestive heart failure Coronary artery disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You had a rapid heart rate and we could not slow the heart rate with medicines without making your heart rate very slow.
We gave you some extra lasix because the rapid heart rate led to some extra fluid in your lungs.
