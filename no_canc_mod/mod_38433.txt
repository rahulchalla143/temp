Admission Date:  [**2119-8-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-8-24**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Tylenol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty [**2119-8-22**] -- Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 88yoF with a h/o severe AS, Afib on coumadin, HTN, HLD who was transferred from OSH with acute pulmonary edema requiring intubation and hypotension requiring pressors.
Per his note, she had a syncopal episode approximately 5 mos ago.
She also c/o occasional SOB but this had recently improved.
Per the family, on the day of admission she developed acute SOB at home and called her neighbor, who is a nurse.
Her daughter had visited her only 30 minutes prior, and states that she did not appear SOB at that time.
There she was intubated for poor responsiveness and started on dopamine gtt for BP 70/40.
Sclera anicteric.
LUNGS: Intubated, bibasilar crackles, no wheezes/rhonchi.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2119-8-23**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN CLUSTERS.
There is no pneumothorax.
Severe cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion is unchanged, vascular congestion and moderated pulmonary edema are worse.
Progressive asymmetric focal opacification in the right lower lobe raises concern for infection.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is partial posterior mitral leaflet flail.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
[**2119-8-23**] TTE: Suboptimal image quality.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Severe aortic stenosis.
Small posterior pericardial effusion.
The severity of mitral regurgitation is reduced, although image quality is technically limited.
The severity of tricuspid regurgitation is reduced.
[**2119-8-22**] Cardiac Catheterization: Patient was brought to the cath lab on ventilator and inotropic support.
Then a Tyshak 20 mm x 6 cm valvuloplasty balloon was railed in over the amplatz wire and situated across the aortic valve.
Severe aortic stenosis status post palliative balloon aortic valvuloplasty 3.
Severe acute MR due to a flail posterior leaflet.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: 88yoF with h/o severe AS, afib on coumadin, HTN, HLD who is transferred from [**Hospital6 33**] for acute pulmonary edema and hypotension requiring intubation and pressors.
On HD#2 TTE showed severe mitral regurgitation with flail valve, and severe aortic stenosis.
She had an aortic balloon valvuloplasty in hopes of improving flow through the stenotic valve.
Unfortunately her blood pressure continued to decrease and she developed renal failure and anuria.
She also developed fever with leukocytosis (WBC 21), and CXR showed e/o RLL pneumonia.
She was started on vanc/cefepime for broad coverage.
