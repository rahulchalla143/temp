He did well until recently when heart failure symptoms developed.
He was found to have significant mitral regurgitation with left ventricular dysfunction.
He was scheduled for rooperation and was admitted now with rapid atrial fibrillation and acute heart failure.

There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20%) with inferior/infero-lateral akinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mitral regurgitation is present (probably mild?)
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Slow ventricular response to atrial fibrillation led to ventricular pacing.
The inferior pole of the incision was opened and it was discovered that the tube had been caught on the Vicryl midline fascial closure suture.
The wound was irrigated with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation.
A small fluid collection at the inferior aspect of the wound substernally was noted and the patient was started on ciprofloxacin and vancomycin for a 7 day course empirically.
There were no positive cultures.
Electrophysiology was consulted due to conduction issues perieoperatively.
Due to prolonged AV conduction, dilated cardiomyopathy and prolonged QRS, it was determined that he needed an ICD placed.
