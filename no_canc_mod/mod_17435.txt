RLE edema/erythema-likely secondary to chronic venous status changes.
However, more erythema over R lower extremity compared to L lower extremity.
I also encouraged the patient to make an appointment with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**1-11**] weeks so that his skin infection could be readdressed, and he could potentially be set up with home VNA services.
