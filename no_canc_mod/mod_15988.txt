Patient states that over the course of the last year he has had exertional angina when taking long walks, but over the course of three weeks the episodes got more frequent.
He describes them as chest tightness and dyspnea in the mid-chest.
EKG showed sinus bradycardia, [**Street Address(2) 1755**] depressions in leads V1 to V4, ST elevation in V6.
Patient was diagnosed with acute posterior MI and received two doses of Retavase 20 minutes after arrival.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] emergency department, ST depressions on EKG were improved and patient was asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable.
Left hernia repair.
Used to be very active, now activities limited by exertional angina.
No history of tobacco or illicit drug use.
In general, the patient was a pleasant gentleman in no apparent distress.
Neck no bruits, jugular venous pressure approximately 4 cm above the clavicles.
Pulmonary clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezing, crackles or rhonchi.
Abdomen positive bowel sounds, soft, nondistended, nontender, no organomegaly.
Extremities no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Acute coronary syndrome, status post acute MI with EKG changes suggestive of posterior wall MI.
EKG suggestive of resolution of ischemia and good reperfusion after lytic therapy.
Patient remained chest pain free overnight.
Patient was found to have mid-RCA total occlusion with collaterals and OM1 lesion, both of which were stented.
After cardiac catheterization patient had a brief episode of hypotension with systolic blood pressure of 80.
Upon return to the CCU, patient had nausea and had an episode of hematemesis.
GI consult was called and it was felt that patient was hemodynamically stable and had gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of anticoagulation and lytic therapy.
Patient was transferred to the regular floor and has not had any subsequent episodes of chest pain.
Patient has had no alarming rhythms on telemetry.
The patient had an episode of acute gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of being anticoagulated with two doses of lytic therapy at the outside hospital as well as Integrilin post cardiac catheterization.
It was decided that since this was in the setting of anticoagulation, patient would, however, benefit from being treated with Protonix and being followed in the outpatient gastroenterology office four to six weeks after discharge for probable endoscopic evaluation.
The patient has a good lipid profile, however, since patient is status post MI and status post stent, he will continue to be on statin therapy as an outpatient.
Acute posterior myocardial infarction.
Gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of treatment with thrombolytics.
