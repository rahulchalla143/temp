Also got MRI of his kidneys which showed severe renal artery narrowing.
In ED, initial VS SBP in 60s, AF, pulse in 60s.
Ischemic CM with EF 20% 2.
CAD with severe 3VD, not cabg candidate 3.
CRI s/p renal xplant [**2103**]; b/l cr 1.2-1.4   Social History: Lives alone, no smoking or alcohol use  Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: PE 97.8 90 94/47 20 91%2L CVP 5 pertinents mmm supple, jvp 8 cm rales [**12-19**] way up rrr, grade ii/vi SEM, ?diastolic murmur no tenderness around iliac fossa  Pertinent Results: DATA CT [**9-22**] 1.
No evidence of intraabdominal abscess.
Patchy consolidation at the right lung base.
Could represent pneumonia or atelectasis.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
Extensive vascular calcification.
Transplant kidney is seen in the right lower quadrant  Brief Hospital Course: This is a 56 year old gentleman with DM Type I and a history of 3 vessel coronary disease (seen in [**2114**] cath.
), ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF of 25 % on echo this admission), aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.9 cm), PVD s/p b/l AKA, s/p renal transplant (baseline Cr 1.2 to 1.4) who was admitted for hypotension and nausea.
PTA he had been in heart failure clinic on [**9-14**] where SBP noted to be in 200's; his hydralazine dose was doubled and his lasix dose increased.
On presentation to ED SBP noted to be 60's pulse in 60s.
Initial Swan numbers revealed elevated PCWP of 23, PAP of 63/23, CVP 9, and SVR of 1300 consistent with cardiogenic shock and L ventricular overload.
Echo peformed on [**9-22**] revealed no significant changes from prior with EF of 25%, degree of AV stenosis was essentially unchanged.
Pt weaned off pressors and began lasix diuretic therapy for CHF exacerbation.
Serial chest x-rays revealed resolving pulmonary edema.
Pt also being followed by renal service for elevated creatinine and for his status post renal transplant in [**2105**].
The patients creatinine was elevated on admission but slowly trended back to normal range by discharge.
There was some concern for rejection on a renal ultrasound but the patient's creatinine had returned to his baseline  Pt was extubated [**9-30**].
Per renal service, this was felt to be secondary to his renal disease and his Epogen was therefore doubled in dosing; in addition, the patient received one unit of blood before his discharge; blood was given with Lasix.
In summary, this is a 56 year-old type I diabetic male with 3 vessel CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 25%, aortic stenosis, s/p b/l AKA,  admitted for hypotension after increases in blood pressure medication and admitted to MICU for hypotension, intubated for respiratory distress.
breathing on room air with no sign of volume overload on physical exam.
Pump:  EF 25%, aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.9), CHF seems to be class II.
-will follow up with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of [**Hospital1 **] Outpatient Heart Failure service.
2) Renal disease, s/p transplant, creatinine now at baseline -continue azathioprine, cyclosporine, please have nephrologist follow this patient.
Status post 1 pRBC transfusion prior to discharge -have increased epogen from 4000 to 8000 qMWF -monitor hct -if pt needs further transfusion, please give Lasix (40 mg IV) before and after transfusion to prevent volume overload.
4) Diabetes, (type I) -In setting of renal insufficiency and renal transplant will need to be on Humalog Sliding Scale.
5) FEN: Diabetic/cardiac healthy; please continue sodium and fluid restriction.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: Four (4) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Cardiogenic shock.
Congestive heart failure exacerbation/ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Aortic stenosis.
Coronary artery disease (three vessel disease) Diabetes Type I.
No symptoms of dizziness or nausea.
No chest pain.
Discharge Instructions: Please return to hospital if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath or palpitations.
Please return to hospital if pt becomes hypotensive.
Pt also to be followed up by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of [**Hospital3 **] outpatient Heart Failure service.
