Brief Hospital Course: 81 y/o female with h/o HTN and T2DM who presented upon transfer from OSH for evaluation and treatment of bradycardia and possible cardiac cath.
1)Bradycardia: Upon admission to OSH, patient found to be severely bradycardic 40s with low SBP (60s) likely secondary to BB toxicity.
After insertion, patient became hemodynamically stable.
Subsequent EKGs taken after admission indicated patient to be in NSR with no abnormal changes.
The decision was made that patient did not need catherization or permanment pacemaker insertion.
2)Elevated cardiac enzymes: Patient noted to have elevated troponins at OSH after receiving temporary pacing device.
Since admission to [**Hospital1 18**], patient without complaints of chest pain and noted to have decreasing Trop levels.
Initial elevation of cardiac enzymes likely due to severe hypotension.
After speaking with family, dementia appears to be a sudden deterioration of mental status.
