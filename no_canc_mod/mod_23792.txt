# Toxic metabolic encephelopathy: Possibly secondary to infection with a WBC elevation to 13, subsequently trended down.
His CXR was read as no acute cardiopulmonary process, but with diffuse consolidation.
It is not clear whether the patient's mental status improved because of antibiotics or because of holding his medications.
Because the patient did not have fevers, cough, and his leukocytosis was transient, also because he remained very hemodynamically stable and well-appearing, he was not continued on IV antibiotics as it was felt to be unlikely that the patient had MRSA or pseudomonas pneumonia given his clinical appearance, and he was thus discharged on PO levofloxacin and flagyl, the latter to cover anaerobes, especially as there may have been an aspiration component to his presentation.
# Diabetes: Continued NPH home regimen (10U qam/5U qpm) and HISS  # Peripheral Vascular Dz: continued on his Plavix, simvastatin.
# Chronic LE Pain: the patient was on amitryptiline, which was held at admission and not restarted on discharge, as this may be contributing to his altered mental status.
# Depression: restarted sertraline.
