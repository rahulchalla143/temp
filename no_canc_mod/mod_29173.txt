He initially attributed the chest pain to heart burn, however, the pain worsened and moved to the left chest and he began to have pain radiating to the neck and down the left arm.
Initial EKG showed 3-[**Street Address(2) 5366**] elevations in II, III, AVF and ST depressions in I and AVL.
In the Cath lab he was found to have a 100% mid cx acute occlusion with thrombus at the bifurcation of the Om and CX.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for sudden onset of chest pain, SOB, diaphoresis and the absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
EKG following catheterization demonstrated resolution of the ST elevation and depressions and Q waves developing inferiorly.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
There was no thyromegaly.
The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
The lungs were clear to ascultation bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds or rubs.
There were no thrills, lifts or palpable S3 or S4.
There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or gallops.
The abdomen was soft nontender and nondistended.
The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid bruits.
Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
The catheterization site is dressed, non-erythematous, no bruit auscultated and no hematoma was palpated.
Selective coronary angiuoplasty of this left dominant system demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had mild luminal  irregularities.
The LCX was a large vessel with 100% total occlusion and thrombus at mid segment extending into the proximal portion of a large OM1.
The RCA was a small vessel without obstructive disease.
Limited resting hemodynamic assessment revealed elevated right heart filling pressures with mean PCWP of 24 mmHg.
There was mild pulmonary hypertension with systolic pulmonary arterial pressure was of 37 mmHg.
One vessel coronary artery disease with abrupt occlusion of a large .
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**2172-6-16**] Conclusions:  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal and mid inferior/inferolateral walls, and mid-lateral wall (LVEF 40-45%), consistent with coronary disease in the left circumflex territory.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet  excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
Stented main LCX and rescued OM with resulting 0% occlusion in the LCX and 30-40% in the OM with normal flow.

CAD/STEMI: The patient presented with signs and symptoms consistent with an anterior STEMI.
Following the catheterization he had an episode of AIVR and was hypoxic [**3-13**] to volume overload/CHF.
Glucose intolerance: The patient had an elevated BG throughout his stay.
Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction 2.
Congestive heart failure   Discharge Condition: good, pain free   Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack and had a stent placed in an artery in your heart.
Followup Instructions: Please follow-up with your cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] on Monday  Your fasting blood sugar was elevated, putting you at risk for diabetes.
