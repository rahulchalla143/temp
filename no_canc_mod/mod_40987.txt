At [**Hospital3 1443**] Hosp, he was treated with avalox and rocephin for possible pneumonia and UTI respectively.
CT showed left intraventricular hemorrhage.
Again went into PEA arrest with epinephrine given, levophed titrated up, bicarb given due to acidosis.
He had an echocardiogram which showed an "ejection fraction of 25%, mildly dilated LA, mild symmetric LVH, mid-distal anteroseptal and apical akinesis and hypokinesis elsewhere, RV cavity dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis, mild AR, mild MR, no pericardial effusion."
A family meeting was held in which the patient's code status was changed to DNR (no shocks or chest compressions).
# Hypotension: Unclear etiology of hypotension; echo showed depressed ejection fraction so maybe cardiogenic in origin.
Unlikely to be hypovolemia given lack of bleeding source and lack of response to aggressive fluid resucitation.
Attempts were made to place radial and femoral a-lines but were unsuccessful due to peripheral arterial disease.
# IVH: likely secondary to fall in the setting of supratherapeutic INR.
A CT head showed no interval change in intraventricular hemorrhage in the temporal and occipital horns of the left lateral ventricle.
# AG metabolic acidosis and appropriate compensatory respiratory alkalosis: AG likely due to lactic acidosis.
No evidence of DKA or other toxin exposures.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Was likely to be pre-renal or ATN in the setting of shock.
We do not know the baseline status of his renal function.
# DM - diet controlled with fingersticks qACHS, start gentle insulin SS .
# hypothydroidism  - thyroid medication dosage not confirmed prior to his status as being made CMO.
# Lung nodules - a CT demonstrate ground glass opacities and a nodules that should be followed up in [**2-1**] months.
