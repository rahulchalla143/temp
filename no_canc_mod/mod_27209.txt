He has been monitored with serial echocardiograms, but has recently noticed increased in dyspnea on exertion.
Most recent echo revealed an LVEF of 50% and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.62 cm2 and 2+ MR.  Past Medical History: [**Location (un) **] Stenosis, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, Eczema/Rosacea, s/p Tonsillectomy, s/p Excision of malignant melanoma from right ear  Social History: Quit smoking 11 yrs ago after [**2-16**] ppd x 25yrs.
Mild post-stenotic [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] dilatation.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated no angiographically apparent flow limiting coronary artery disease.
There was a 65 mmHg gradient across the [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve upon pull back of the catheter from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta corresponding to an [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve area of 0.5cm2.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (3+) was noted.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There are focal calcifications in the [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is moderate [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve stenosis (area 1.0) There is no dilatation of the ascending aorta or the arch.
Moderate to severe (3+) [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no definite leaflet prolapse or flail seen.
There is dilatation of the left atrium.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a prosthesis in the mitral annular position, stable and functioning well.
There is no residual MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
There is a small eccentric AI jet and discussed with surgeon and it seems to be decreasing in size.
Brief Hospital Course: On [**4-22**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken for a cardiac cath which revealed severe [**Known lastname 8813**] stenosis and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation without coronary disease.
Early on post-op day three he had episode of rapid atrial fibrillation and Amiodarone bolus was given (followed by PO Amiodarone).
