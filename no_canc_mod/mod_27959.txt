Mom developed pregnancy-induced hypertension approximately 3 weeks prior to delivery, as well as found to have an incompetent cervix.
Transferred to L and D. Had onset of preterm labor with contractions.
At delivery, the female infant required blow-by oxygen and brief facial CPAP.
General exam: A well-developed, small premature female infant in no acute distress, quiet transition, but responsive to carers, well-perfused.
No significant retractions.
Patient had apnea of prematurity with infrequent spells and was started on caffeine, and remained on caffeine from day of life 6 to 16.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Initially, there was no murmur auscultated, but on day life 24, the baby was noted to have an intermittent murmur on my exam, loudest at left second intercostal space with radiation to the back.
Chest x-ray showed mild diffuse haziness, otherwise normal cardiac size, and mildly increased size of the thymus, and on [**6-29**] the EKG that was performed was read as normal.
The patient remained normotensive throughout her stay with an occasional wide pulse pressure that was likely due to equipment error.
GI: On admission, the patient had a UVC placed, and IV fluids were begun including parenteral nutrition until day of life 7 when she was started on feeds with breast milk through an NG tube.
GU: The patient was noted to have a right inguinal hernia, and on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**7-2**], she was taken to the operating room for the repair and was found to have bilateral inguinal hernias.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE: The baby was given antibiotics for the first 3 days of life until sepsis was ruled out; her blood culture was negative.
No other infections were notable.
A follow-up was    done on [**6-7**] that showed resolved hemorrhages and was    within normal limits.
A follow-up head ultrasound on    [**6-24**] showed 1) bilateral subependymal cysts in the    germinal matrix slightly more prominent than previously,    and 2) tiny ovoid cystic structures in the left    periventricular white matter less than 1 mm, consistent    with PVL, or periventricular leukomalacia.
Before this age, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
Sepsis ruled out.
Mild hyperbilirubinemia status post phototherapy.
Mild focal periventricular leukomalacia on the left.
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization.
Bilateral inguinal hernias--repaired.
