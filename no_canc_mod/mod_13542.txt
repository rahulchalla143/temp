Her husband states that she sustained an abrasion to the area and had headaches, but was otherwise herself until Monday around noon.
At that time, he noted that she had slurred speech and unsteady gait for a period of approximately 3 hours.
However, he came home this evening around 5 pm, and noted shortly afterward that she seemed sluggish, with slurred speech.
Her arms and legs were extended and rigid with hands open and feet plantarflexed.
She was sedated on Propofol, then switched to Versed given hypotension (SBP 70s).
Urinalysis showed 15 ketones and serum aspirin level was within normal limits at 72.
The patient was started on Neo-Synephrine en route to [**Hospital1 18**] for persistent hypotension.
Her husband reports an unintentional 20 pound weight loss in recent months.
Past Medical History: -Generalized tonic-clonic seizures, history per recent note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from [**2175-9-12**]: "First seizure in [**2171**] in the setting of an intentional Wellbutrin overdose and fall resulting in a right temporal lobe contusion.
She was event free until [**4-19**] when she had several episodes of loss of consciousness and confusion after a minor head trauma.
At that time, she had several, back to back seizures consisting of unresponsiveness and left head and eye version.
As usual, it was preceded by overwhelming anxiety and fear.
Precipitants for seizures reportedly include alcohol, sleep deprivation and missed medication doses.
Head trauma may be another.
-s/p small subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages in right frontal lobe with small intraventricular hemorrhage with initial seizure in [**2171-6-15**] -Muscle tension headaches in setting of cervical spondylosis -Dyslipidemia -Hypothyroidism -Depression -Panic disorder -Alcohol abuse -s/p right shoulder repair repeated multiple dislocations with possible residual right arm weakness  Social History: Lives with husband, has 2 children, recently gained job at Stop n' Shop and resumed driving after clearance of seizures for over a year.
By report, mother with coronary artery disease and diabetes, died at age 56.
Then appeared to have decerebrate-type posturing.
Later noted rhythmic clonic movement at feet.
No purposeful movement.
Reflexes: DTRs could not be elicited due to rigidity.
Coordination and Gait: Could not be assessed  Pertinent Results: [**2175-11-3**] 08:23AM CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF)  WBC-1 RBC-5* POLYS-0 LYMPHS-100 MONOS-0 [**2175-11-3**] 08:22AM CEREBROSPINAL FLUID (CSF)  PROTEIN-57* GLUCOSE-101 [**2175-11-3**] 11:56AM   PHENYTOIN-14.0 [**2175-11-3**] 12:27AM   LACTATE-2.9* [**2175-11-3**] 12:20AM   WBC-7.8 RBC-4.63 HGB-14.4 HCT-43.1 MCV-93 MCH-31.2 MCHC-33.5 RDW-13.1 [**2175-11-3**] 12:20AM   LIPASE-48 [**2175-11-3**] 12:20AM   ALT(SGPT)-13 AST(SGOT)-29 CK(CPK)-132 TOT BILI-0.2 [**2175-11-3**] 09:01AM   LACTATE-0.9  Brief Hospital Course: 51 year-old woman with history of seizures since [**2171**], the first of which occurred in the setting of polysubstance (Wellbutrin and Buspar) overdose, with resultant right temporal subdual and subarachnoid hemorrhages, also with depression, panic disorder, alcohol abuse, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism, who presents with "unresponsiveness" and tonic clonic movements concerning for a seizure.
Limited examination at this time is notable for possible for rigidity and abnormal movements that may represent generalized tonic-clonic activity versus decerebrate posturing.
Initial laboratory studies are notable only for an elevated lactate, which may be secondary to ictal activity or hypotension, and hypocalcemia.
Head CT shows an old posterior right temporal hypodensity, likely encephalomalacia from her prior contusion.
The possible seizures could be due to recent recurrent head trauma or medication non-compliance.
Neuro -LP showed protein 57, glucose 101, WBC 1, 100% lymph, RBC 5, gram stain showed no microorganisms, bacterial culture showed no growth, f/u HSV PCR and Lyme -Discontinued Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Acyclovir given LP results -CT Head showed no acute intracranial process, stable encephalomalacia in the right temporal lobe.
-MRI/MRA of the head showed right temporal encephalomalacia and small areas of encephalomalacia in the subcortical white matter of right frontal and parietal lobes which have evolved since the previous MRI of [**2171-7-2**], no acute infarct seen, mass effect, or hydrocephalus identified, somewhat artifact-limited normal MRA of the head -EEG showed slow background and occasional suppressive bursts.
These findings suggest a widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
There were no clearly epileptiform features.
-Keppra increased from 1500 mg PO bid to 2000mg [**Hospital1 **], weaned off Dilantin -Ativan IV prn seizure cluster -urine tox positive for benzos, serum tox ASA 6 -CT C-spine showed no acute fracture or malalignment, multilevel degenerative changes, C-collar removed  2.

Respiratory -Extubated [**11-4**] -CTA chest: no evidence of PE - Stable while on floor  4.
ID - blood cultures negative -CXR showed no consolidation -UA showed 50 ketones, neg leuk/nitr, f/u urine culture -CSF culture showed no growth -Lactate 2.9->0.9 - HSV CSF pending at d/c - Afebrile while on floor  5.
FEN/GI -Prelim read of CT abd/pelvis showed early SBO, attending read showed marked distention of the distal duodenum and jejunum with thickening of the mucosal wall concerning for ischemia, though could represnet shock bowel.
There is no evidence for vascular insufficiency.
There is no evidence for small bowel obstruction and distal loops of small and large bowel are normal in appearance.
-She also had coffee grounds emesis out of NG tube, Surgery consulted: no evidence of obstruction upon attending review but finding c/w hypotensive ischemia -LFTs, lipase normal -f/u stool guaiac -Regular diet -IVF standing -Cont.
Ca/Vit D - No evidence of GI bleeding while on floor  6.
Outpatient Physical Therapy for gait steadiness   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Seizure vs. post-concussive seizure vs. seritonin syndrome vs. non epileptic seizure   Discharge Condition: Good.
