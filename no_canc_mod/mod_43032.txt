ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Twenty-five pack year history of smoking, however, the patient no longer smokes.
The patient was initially managed with Captopril, Lopressor, and aspirin; however, several episodes of spontaneously increased blood pressure over the course of his two hospital admission days resulted in the addition of nitroglycerin paste for additional pressure control.
An echocardiogram obtained on [**2126-3-27**], demonstrated evidence of inducible ischemia; subsequent cardiac catheterization demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease with 90% occlusion of the proximal LAD, 80% midsegment occlusion of the left circumflex, and 80-90% occlusion of the right coronary artery.
The cardiac catheterization additionally demonstrated mild to moderate diastolic biventricular dysfunction.
The patient's ejection fraction was noted to be approximately 51% with no evidence of focal regional wall abnormalities.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with a CABG times three with anastomosis from the LIMA to LAD, saphenous vein graft to the PDA, and saphenous vein graft to the OM.
Shortly following arrival in the CSRU, the patient was successfully weaned and extubated without complication.
The patient's postoperative course was notable for occasional incidents of elevated blood pressure with systolics in the 160s and 170s, as well as significant anxiety on the part of the patient.
On postoperative day number six, the patient complained of a diffuse itching; physical examination demonstrated a mild papular dry rash effecting the patient's trunk.
The patient was subsequently advised to refrain from ingestion of opiate pain medications and demonstrated progressive relief from his pruritic symptoms over the following days with therapy via Benadryl and Sarna lotion.
In addition, the patient demonstrated intermittent episodes of respiratory wheezing which were responsive to Albuterol nebulizer treatments.
The patient was subsequently trained in the use of an Albuterol inhaler following clear x-ray studies demonstrating no evidence of pulmonary infiltrate.
At the request of the patient's primary care provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient was also set up with an outpatient MRA to evaluate his renal perfusion and assess for possible evidence of renovascular hypertension.
By postoperative day number eight, the patient was noted to be ambulatory and tolerating a full regular diet with adequate pain control provided oral pain medications.
The patient was noted to have mild persistent respiratory wheezing responsive to Albuterol inhaler treatment, as well as steadily improving opioid related pruritus.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to maintain his Foley catheter in place until follow-up appointment with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 365**] five to seven days following discharge for a voiding trial.
FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with his primary care provider within one to two weeks following discharge for potential outpatient MRA study to rule out renovascular hypertension.
The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 365**] five to seven days following discharge for a voiding trial.
