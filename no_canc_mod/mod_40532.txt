His EKG showed sinus tach with S1Q3T3.
Initial CXR showed no infiltrates.
LENIs were negative for DVT b/l.
A CXR on [**6-16**] AM showed multifocal patchy opacities, worsening on the right, most likely multifocal PNA vs atypical CHF or ARDS.
He received Zosyn x1 and had a Foley placed with cloudy urine returning which was concerning for a UTI (no urine output since last night per report).
Mother denies fever or chills prior to OSH presentation, did endorse cold-like symptoms at that time.
Borderline DM 3. h/o HTN (not currently on meds) 4.
Morbid Obesity   Social History: Works on cars, was recently in junkyard looking for car parts.

Imaging: Renal US [**6-18**]-The right kidney measures 12.5, the left kidney measures 12.1 cm without evidence of hydronephrosis, stones or masses bilaterally.
The urinary bladder is emptied and a Foley catheter is seen.
Mildly depressed global left ventricular function with right ventricular dilatation and moderately depressed function.
No evidence of endocarditis or abscess.
EEG [**6-21**]-IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of diffuse slowing over both hemispheres suggestive of a severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction.
In addition there is higher voltage, slower waves over the left hemisphere suggestive of more severe independent dysfunction over the left hemisphere.
This could clinically correlate with structural or physiologic lesion in the left hemisphere.
Opacities are present in the right perihilar region and these could indicate failure or bronchopneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 43-year-old morbidly obese male with gout, DM, and HTN who presented to OSH with DOE, abdominal and chest pain on [**6-14**] and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with hypoxemic respiratory failure and hypotension requiring ventilation and pressor support.
He was also found to have end-organ injuries including the kidneys and liver.
# Respiratory failure: patient presented with dyspnea and intubated at OSH.
PE was suspected at OSH, but V/Q scan showed low probability and heparin drip was discontinued since transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
He was empirically treated for HCAP pneumonia with vanc, cefepime and azithromycin for 8 days and kept on ventilator support with high PEEP.
He was extubated on [**6-25**] with no complications and his O2Sat has been stable post-extubation.
# Hypotension: On transfer, vasopressors were required to maintain blood pressure.
There was evidence of hypoperfusion with elevated lactate, kidney and liver failure.
TEE showed LVEF 40% (down from EF 70% on TTE done at OSH), hypokinetic right ventricle, and trace mitral regurgitation.
Septic or cardiogenic shock was suspected to result in hypotension, and he was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, pressor support, and fluid boluses.
# Acute Kidney Injury: His Cr was found to be elevated on transfer and continued to rise during this hospitalization.
It was thought that his kidneys were injured during the hypoperfusion episode causing pre-renal acute renal failure and ATN.
# Shocked liver: His AST and ALT were elevated [**1-16**] acute hepatitis from hypoperfusion.
His RUQ ultrasound showed normal liver and gallbladder mormophology.
# Altered mental status: He remained unresponsive when he was off of Fentanyl and midazolam.
There was a concern for anoxic brain damage or sedation effect, and continuous EEG was obtained.
The EEG showed diffuse dysfunctions, but no epileptical activities.
The patient became responsive more than 72 hours after being off of the sedatives, and it was likely that it took a while to clear sedatives from his system resulting in altered mental status.
At the time of discharge, the patient is awake, alert, conversant, with no focal neurological deficits.
# Hypernatremia: He developed hypernatremia in the setting of lasix diuresis and inability to access free water.
# Rash: Patient developed erythematous patches on LUQ and left upper arm with central hematoma.
It could be drug reaction or contact dermatitis from injection sites/dressings.
The rash appears to be resolving in distribution and erythema.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Respiratory Failure, Hypotension Secondary: Morbid obesity, Renal failure, liver failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for respiratory failure and low blood pressure.
Your condition required life-supporting measurements to help you with breathing and heart functions.
Your kidneys and liver were found to be damaged from low blood pressure, but they have been gradually improving.
