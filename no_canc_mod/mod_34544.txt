Patient states she was lying down in bed last night around 6pm when she began to have difficulty swallowing and SOB.
Patient denies any chest pain, weakness, numbness, nausea, vomiting, visual changes, diarrhea, hematemesis, hematochezia, hematuria or any abnormal bleeding.
Past Medical History: - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (1st episode in [**2122**]; recent episode on [**7-5**] and discharged in [**7-15**]; reportedly lacks an ADAMSTS-13 inhibitor) - Prior right basal ganglia stroke with resultant left-sided hemiparesis - Hypothyroidism - Hyperlipidemia  Social History: Occupation: Housewife Drugs: None Tobacco: Quit in [**2122**], 20 pack year history Alcohol: None Other: Lives in [**Location 78931**], NH with her husband  Family History: No TTP  Physical Exam: Admission Exam: T 97.1,   BP 142/68,  HR 79,  RR 16,  Sat 99% on room air General Appearance: Well nourished, No acute distress, Overweight Eyes / Conjunctiva: PERRL, Conjunctiva pale Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: Normocephalic, no tubes Lymphatic: Cervical WNL, Supraclavicular WNL Cardiovascular: PMI Normal, normal S1S2, no rubs/murmurs Peripheral Vascular: intact radial/PT pulses Chest: clear to auscultation throughout, no w/r/r Abdominal: Soft, Non-tender, Bowel sounds present, nondistended Extremities: no edema, clubbing, or cyanosis Musculoskeletal: no muscle wasting Skin:  Warm, no rashes/petechiae Neurologic: attentive, Follows simple commands, Responds to: Not assessed, Oriented (to): person, place, time, CN II-XII intact, [**4-4**] strengh left thigh and right thigh, 1/5 strength left leg extension/left foot extension, [**4-4**] strenght right leg extension, right foot extension/flexion  Pertinent Results: .
CT head w/o contrast ([**2140-7-19**]): This exam is slightly limited due to motion.
Large area of encephalomalacia in the right basal ganglia and extending into the right frontal lobe are consistent with prior infarct.
There is subsequent ex vacuo dilatation of the right lateral ventricle.
There is no definite evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarct.
Hypoattenuation extending superiorly from the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle may be due to an additional chronic infarct.
There is no hemorrhage.
CXR PA/lat ([**2140-7-19**]): The lungs are clear with no evidence of aspiration or pneumonia.
The pleural surfaces are smooth with no effusion or pneumothorax.
There is mild tortuosity of the aorta.
Long gentle rightward thoracic scoliosis is noted.
ECG ([**2140-7-19**]): Sinus rhythm at 80 bpm, normal axis, normal intervals, no ST segment changes, Q waves in anterior (I, aVL), inferior (II, III, aVF), and lateral (V4-V6) leads.
No ST segment or T wave changes.
Low voltage.
Hematology and blood bank both recommended initiation of plasmapheresis given the high suspicion for recurrent TTP.
She tolerated the first round of plasmapheresis without difficulty.
She had no evidence of bleeding complications.
She was noted to have asymptomatic pyuria on a urinalysis and culture was sent off.
She reported a history of Bactrim-sensitive and quinolone-resistant UTIs in the past.
A CT of her head demonstrated evidence of an old right basal ganglia infarction and new acute abnormalities.
Her transient neurologic symptoms were thought to be due to her recurrent TTP.
If symptoms recur, consideration should be given to an MRI and/or neurologic consultation.
Recurrent thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (prior workup reportedly demonstrated lack of an ADAMSTS 13 inhibitor).
Urinary tract infection (self-reports history of quinolone-resistant, Bactrim-sensitive UTIs).
Hyperlipidemia 2. prior stroke with resultant left-sided hemiparesis 3.
Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: fair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the [**Hospital 18**] medical ICU for a recurrence of your TTP.
