Patient reports being admitted for chf exacerbation in mid-[**Month (only) 116**] at [**Hospital 4415**] with active diuresis and concern for ACS, but because of imparied renal function, plan to medical manage and not sent to cath lab.
On [**4-13**], patient presented to [**Hospital1 **] with cheif complaints of left scapular pain and shortness of breath - diagnosed with acute decompensated heart failure, subsequently diuresed, ruled in for NQWMI with troponin up to 11.4, ck 290, 12% R/I.
[**4-17**] cardiac cath showed 3-v native disease (RCA not seen), LIMA to LAD-40-50% mid disease, SVG to LV branch of prox CX: 80% eccentric proximal stenosis which became worse during cath (?
catheter trauma), SVG to OM: proximal occlusion, with an estimated EF 55-60%.
of TIA vs. stroke last Wed [**4-18**] day after cath, with clinical signs of right hand weakness, with no other signs/symptoms since that time and CT scan negative for acute pathology (no MRI done).
On [**4-18**], patient had another rise in ck and troponin, with rise back up to 12 (previously 2).
Patient has reportedly been chest pain free over weekend on ntg and heparin gtts.
Bilateral wheezes.
In cath lab, cobalt chronium, BMS stent placed in proximal [**11-22**] of SVG to RCA, where a 70% stenosis was identified.
ROS+ for claudication symptoms in her lower extremities after walking distance.
+ nasal symptoms thought [**12-22**] to seasonal allergies.
CAD - MI complicated by cardiogenic shock in [**2107**], leading to CABG with LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to PLV 2.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation 6.
Chronic renal insufficiency - baseline Cr 2.5 with acute failure with creatinine rise to 5.0.
Renal artery angioplasty in [**2107**].
GI bleed - unsure of nature of bleed 8.
Hypertension 9.
Hyperlipidemia - untreated due to side effects 10.
Right carotid stenosis - CEW [**2107**] Cardiac Risk Factors: Dyslipidemia, Hypertension, atrial fibrillation Cardiac History: CABG - LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to PLV   Social History: Social history is significant for tobacco use - >49 pack year history, not currently smoking, quit six years ago.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
HEENT: no conjunctival pallor, no scleral icterus appreciated, MMM.
NECK: no JVD appreciated, but bed broken and in fully supine position and obese neck.
No murmurs appreciated.
LUNGS: mild crackles at the bases bilaerally, no wheezes appreciated ABD: NABS, soft, non-tender, non-distended.
No organomegaly appreciated.
EXT: no lower extremity edema appreciated.
2+ palpable pulses bilaterally dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial, radial, ulnar, all 2+.
There is pulmonary vascular congestion with interstitial edema.
No evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion with interstitial edema representing CHF.
ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (ejection fraction 40-50 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the basal and midventricular segments of the inferior and posterior walls.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2114-4-28**] ECHO  Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral akinesis and hypokinesis elsewhere.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-4-24**], the left and right ventricles are now more dilated and left and right ventricular systolic function now appears more depressed.
There is mild increased echogenicity of the renal cortex.
No hydronephrosis or stones.
Mild increased echogenicity of the renal cortex consistent with chronic parenchymal renal disease.
No evidence of obstruction.
[**2114-4-23**]  CARDIAC CATH  COMMENTS:     Successful bare metal stenting of a SVG-RCA stenosis using distal protection followed by a 3.5x15mm Vision stent post-dilated to 20atm using a NC balloon.
A statin was not started due to her reactions to statins in the past.
An echocardiogram post-cath showed mild hypokinesis.
She underwent cath without complications and four hours later she went into flash pulmonary edema with no EKG changes.
On the floor, she continued to receive 60 mg IV lasix [**Hospital1 **] for diuresis and she stabilized, was comfortable off oxygen and ambulatory and wanted to be discharged on [**4-26**].
Early on [**2114-4-27**], she had a NSTEMI with troponins up to 7, and went into severe pulmonary edema requiring face mask, with severe respiratory distress that did not respond to 160 mg IV lasix.
On the floor, she remained off lasix for 24 hours with no edema.
NSTEMI: The patient had a cardiac enzyme leak during this exacerbation.
This NSTEMI may have been causal or a result of her CHF exacerbation.
She remained in sinus rhythm, and not on coumadin due to a history of GI bleed.` .
We felt this was most likely c/w contrast nephropathy plus possibly some prerenal azotemia in the setting of aggressive diuresis.
Patient was initially given D5W with bicarb pre-cath and also initially post-cath, but had to be discontinued with development of flash pulmonary edema.
FEN - low sodium, cardiac heart healthy diet.
Lactulose 10 g/15 mL Syrup Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for constipation.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: [**11-21**]  Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive Heart Failure .
Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency - 2.
Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Patient discharged to rehab in stable condition, tolerating PO feeds and fluids, ambulating on her own, chest pain free, no shortness of breath, vital signs stable.
Discharge Instructions: Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for venous grafting intervention, which was presumed to be occluded.
