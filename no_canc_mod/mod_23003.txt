In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, patient had full trauma evaluation by surgery including Ct of head, c-spine, and torso, which did not reveal any major injuries.
On close evaluation, patient had small right heel laceration which was repaired.
During repair, ED resident noted that patient had 20+ beats of clonus.

SERRATIA MARCESCENS.
MODERATE GROWTH.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.
TECHNIQUE: Helical MDCT images were acquired through the torso with intravenous and without oral contrast.
Ground-glass opacity is noted in the right middle lobe, with central hyperdensity, likely representing a pulmonary contusion.
There is peribronchial wall thickening, flattening of the hemidiaphragms, increased anteroposterior diameter, and widening of the retrosternal clear space, suggestive of small airways disease.
Dependent and perifissural atelectasis are present.
There are no pleural effusions.
There is no evidence of active extravasation.
Dense calcifications are noted throughout the thoracic aorta and branch arteries, as well as the aortic root and coronary arteries.
No distal clavicular, proximal humeral, scapular, sternal, or rib fractures are identified.
Note is made of mild pectus excavatum.
Multiple calcified gallstones are noted in a nondistended gallbladder, without wall edema or pericholecystic fluid.
There is mild prominence of the intrahepatic and common bile ducts, the latter measuring up to 8 mm, but tapering smoothly to the level of the pancreatic head.
The pancreas enhances normally, without ductal dilation.
The kidneys enhance promptly and symmetrically, without masses or hydronephrosis.
PELVIS: Scattered sigmoid diverticula are present, without acute inflammation.
Dense calcifications and soft plaques are noted throughout the abdominal aorta, resulting in mild infrarenal aortic, mild celiac, moderate SMA, moderate left renal, and mild right renal artery stenosis.
There is no free intraperitoneal fluid or air.
Multilevel degenerative changes are present in the thoracolumbar spine, with S-shaped scoliosis.
There are no vertebral, pelvic, or proximal femoral fractures.
Right middle lobe contusion.
Lingular bulla abuts the pleural space, and could cause pneumothorax if ruptured.
Diffuse atherosclerosis.

FINDINGS:  Three views of the left ankle demonstrate soft tissue swelling about the lateral and medial malleoli, more on the lateral aspect.
There is a faint linear lucency arising within the distal aspect of the lateral malleolus, suggesting a non-displaced fracture.
In addition, there may be a subtle non-displaced fracture arising at the lateral aspect of the distal tibia extending into the tibial plafond.
This could represent trabecular markings, and if confirmation is required, CT may be helpful for further assessment.
Moderate joint effusion.
No other gross abnormalities.
DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 3993**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3994**] Approved: WED [**2117-6-23**] 8:46 AM  	Imaging Lab   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 year old man with a PMHx significant for DM, HTN, COPD, and CAD who presented to the hospital status post an MVA with a L mallelolar fracture.
#Nondisplaced Left malleolar fracture secondary to MVA: Upon arrival to the hospital, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was initially seen and evaluated by the trauma service.
Due to erythema surrounding the left foot, plain films of the foot were obtained which did not demonstrate a fracture.
Upon physical examination, clonus was elicited upon dorsiflexion of the left foot and neurologic injury was suspected.
Upon extubation, however, and Mr. [**Known lastname 88976**] resumption of consciousness without neurologic injury, point tenderness was elicited on the left lateral malleolus and dedicated ankle films were obtained which demonstrated a non-displaced fracture of the lateral malleolus.
# Leukocytosis: Upon admission, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was found to have leukocytosis to 19.1, but without a source of infection, and recent use of prednisone for a COPD exacerbation, infection was not seen as the most likely cause (negative UA, Clear CXR, no evidence of skin/soft tissue infection, and negative blood cultures).
Upon extubation on day 2 of admission ([**6-21**]), patient noted cough which was consistent with his baseline cough associated with COPD.
On day 3 of admission, respiratory secretions obtained while the patient was still intubated were found to be positive for SERRATIA MARCESCENS (found to be pan-sensitive on day 4 of admission).
By the time that the Serratia was found on culture, Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a resolving white blood cell count (13.1 from peak of 19.1) without treatment with antibiotics, and the decision was made not to treat.
On day of discharge, WBC had declined to 9.1 without antibiotics and Mr. [**Known lastname **] remained afebrile throughout admission.
# Possible OSA: This MVA was caused by an apparent sleep attack.
Furthermore, Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a history of excessive daytime sleepiness with prominent snoring.
In the MICU, he was noted to desaturate to the 80's during sleep with apneic episodes.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] also notes sleep onset and maintenance insomnia which is also contributing to his excessive sleepiness.
Due to hypoxemia with ambulation to 85% on room air, fluticasone/salmeterol was increased to 500/50 [**Hospital1 **].
# Afib: Warfarin therapy with 8mg (Sun, Tues, Thurs, Sat)/6mg (Mo, Wed, Fri) was continued, but in light of borderline elevated INR to 2.7 on day 4 of admission, warfarin was kept at 6mg daily.
# Anemia: Mr. [**Known lastname 88976**] hematocrit on discharge was 35.9 which is decidedly below his baseline hematocrit of 44 at Dr.[**Name (NI) 9920**].
Mr. [**Known lastname **] had no significant blood loss during the accident, and no hematuria/hematemesis/hematochezia/melena were noted during this admission.
