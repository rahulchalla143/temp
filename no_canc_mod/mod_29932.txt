Admission Date:  [**2163-1-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2163-1-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2093-9-8**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 69-year-old gentleman had a known history of mitral valve prolapse and a history of severe mitral regurgitation and congestive heart failure, who was referred in by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] for outpatient cardiac catheterization prior to having surgical repair of his mitral valve.
He is admitted to [**Hospital1 188**] on [**12-20**] after an episode of PND and orthopnea.
He was treated for congestive heart failure with diuretics.
Echocardiogram was done at that time which showed 4+ mitral regurgitation with partial leaflet flail and 1+ AI.
He then went home and returned for cardiac catheterization.
Congestive heart failure.
A-V nodal reentry tachycardia status post A-V nodal modification in [**2158-12-22**].
ALLERGIES:  He had no known allergies.
PREOPERATIVE ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Normal sinus rhythm with occasional PVC and an intraventricular conduction delay.
PREOPERATIVE CHEST X-RAY:  Mild congestive heart failure with some peribronchial cuffing.
He was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] and was seen Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 99826**] of Cardiothoracic Surgery in preparation for his minimally invasive mitral valve repair.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, he was in sinus rhythm with ectopic beats at 60, his blood pressure is 130/80.
Heart sounds were normal with a mitral systolic murmur.
No peripheral edema.
On postoperative day one while he had some ectopy and was A-paced with a blood pressure of 101/45, he started his aspirin.
He was seen by Physical Therapy and transferred out to the floor on postoperative day one, and was switched over to oral pain medications.
He had a little bit of serosanguinous drainage from his right chest tube.
Patient had a junctional rhythm over 3.5 days as well as a fever which was treated with Tylenol.
He had one episode of supraventricular tachycardia.
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **], Cardiology, mentioned that a permanent pacer may be a possibility, but would off to make sure that there was no infection involved with the fever.
His lungs were clear with a faint systolic rub.
His underlying rhythm was sinus bradycardia, and he has come out of his junctional rhythms for very brief periods.
He is still being monitored for the potential need of a pacemaker due to his junctional rhythm and bradycardia.
On postoperative day six, he had maintained long periods of sinus rhythm overnight alternating with junctional rhythm with no episodes of either tachycardia or bradycardia.
He had an episode of atrial fibrillation that morning with a rapid rate, and was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] at that time.
On postoperative day seven, he persisted in atrial fibrillation at a rapid rate.
On [**1-20**], postoperative day seven, the patient continued to be in atrial fibrillation which was rate controlled.
Most of the time he was given 150 mg IV amiodarone bolus with no conversion to normal sinus rhythm and no significant change.
He was tolerating his Lopressor well at decreased dose, IV Heparin continued, and he remained in atrial fibrillation with blood pressure of 116/70.
On the 31st, he had good hemodynamics with no symptoms.
He remained in atrial fibrillation as previously noted, to receive a pacemaker that day.
FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was instructed to have followup with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] Cardiology of Cardiology for his INR and anticoagulation status and Coumadin dosing as well as followup for his arrhythmia and pacemaker placement.
Status post minimally invasive mitral valve repair.
Status post congestive heart failure.
Arteriovenous nodal modification in [**2158-12-22**].
