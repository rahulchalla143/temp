HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83 [**Hospital **] nursing home resident with a history of Alzheimer's disease, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft who developed acute onset of abdominal pain in the morning of [**2181-6-14**].
The pain was mainly periumbilical without radiation and without fevers or chills.
The patient was taken to the outside hospital where an abdominal x-ray showed no evidence of obstruction and moderate feces.
Pertinent physical examination findings included a minimally distended abdomen with tenderness to palpation and epigastrium and right abdomen.
Voluntary guarding with minimal rebound.
Rectal examination revealed heme positive brown stool with no masses.
Nasogastric retrieved approximately 200 cc of coffee ground material.
Chest x-ray obtained revealed no obvious free air in the abdomen.
Further workup with CT revealed free air and fluid in the abdomen thought likely to be from the first part of the duodenum.
No other abnormal pathology was revealed on this CT.
The decision was made to take the patient to the Operating Room where an exploratory laparotomy revealed a large duodenal perforation secondary to a duodenal ulcer.
During her Intensive Care Unit stay the patient was awake and alert following discontinuation of sedation and extubation even though she had periods of confusion possibly secondary to her underlying dementia.
On the night of [**6-20**] and again on the morning of [**6-21**] the patient was found to be experiencing some respiratory difficulty with desaturations to the upper 80s and then later to the mid 70s.
This was suspected to be secondary to the patient's hydration status contributing to thickening of pulmonary mucous secretions.
PERTINENT DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:  CT of the abdomen with and without contrast performed on [**2181-6-15**] revealed three intraperitoneal gas with ascites, likely site of rupture is in the duodenal blood.
