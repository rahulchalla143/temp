She was administered 40 mg of Lasix, 2 mg of morphine and .25 inch of nitropaste and transferred to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital.
Chest x-ray performed was consistent with a right lower lobe pneumonia and she was administered Ceftriaxone at [**Hospital1 882**] and Levofloxacin/Flagyl at the [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department.
Congestive heart failure.
Normal EF greater then 55%, left ventricular hypertrophy, severe atrial fibrillation on echocardiogram [**2104-6-1**].
She has acute pulmonary edema approximately one time per month.
Aortic stenosis.
Chronic right pleural effusion.
Osteoporosis being treated with Alendronate.
Osteoarthritis - status post humeral fractures, vertebral compression fractures.
Chronic anemia - likely iron deficiency.
Recurrent urinary tract infections.
Chronic colonization of C-difficile, multiple admissions.
She has a history of recurrent colitis.
Hypertension - blood pressure on medications approximately 120/60.
Chest decreased breath sounds on the right side and no wheezes.
Cardiovascular tachycardic, regular S1 and S2, 3 out of 6 harsh systolic murmur at the upper sternal borders bilaterally.
No guarding or rebound.
Right toe with a positive Babinski.
Arterial blood gas demonstrated pH 7.4, PCO2 45, PO2 of 81.  NOTABLE STUDIES:  Echocardiogram on [**2106-2-12**] demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction at 75 to 80%, mild left atrial dilatation, normal right atrium, severe aortic valve stenosis, 1+ aortic regurgitation.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation.
There was mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension noted.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2106-2-25**] demonstrated prevalvuloplasty, left ventricular systolic and diastolic pressures of 205/14 and aortic systolic/diastolic mean pressures of 100/45/65.
Post valvuloplasty left ventricular systolic/diastolic pressures were 210/14.
The patient received 10 milliliters of nonionic osmolar contrast for this study.
IMPRESSION:  Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with severe aortic stenosis with a prevalvuloplasty valve area of 0.45 cm, which has been complicated by congestive heart failure.
She presented to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital in decompensated congestive heart failure and hypotensive secondary to diuresis.
Cardiovascular:  On presentation Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] was hypotensive requiring support with fluids and pressors.
Likely etiology was an exacerbation of congestive heart failure in which she was administered diuresis.
As the patient's cardiovascular physiology requires her to be preload dependent, the patient could not handle this loss of intravascular volume.
The patient was noted to have critical aortic stenosis prior to her presentation to [**Hospital1 346**].
Despite the limited efficacy and a mortality of this procedure the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy wanted to pursue this option for the patient as this would have been the patient's wishes.
On [**2106-2-25**] the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory and had a aortic valvuloplasty performed.
Status post valvuloplasty the patient improved clinically with increasing urine output and improving mental status.
Initially she presented with a Dopamine drip, however, this was changed to a neo-synephrine.
On presentation, Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] have ruled in for a myocardial infarction.
This was associated with small ST changes consistent with her previous strain pattern and some small T wave inversions were noted in V2 through V3.
A valvoplasty was pursued secondary to an inability to manage her congestive heart failure, which was likely the underlying pulmonary process preventing weaning.
This procedure was complicated by some bleeding in to the trachea, which formed a blood clot.
The patient became acutely hypertensive, tachycardic and tachypneic.
Significant amount of blood clot and tissue was removed from the patient's airway, several cm above the carina for several days status post trach, the patient required more vigorous tracheal suction, but she had no further episodes of blood clots obstructing her airways.
Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] was known to have a chronic right pleural effusion.
She [**Known lastname 1834**] thoracentesis to evaluate this pleural effusion secondary to her difficulty weaning.
The pleural fluid demonstrated no organisms or PMNs on gram stain.
Fluid analysis demonstrated that this was consistent with a transudative process, specifically congestive heart failure related.
Secondary to persistent fevers and an infiltrate on the left lung on chest x-ray consistent with pleural effusion, a repeat thoracentesis was performed on [**2-23**] on the left side of the lung.
This was also consistent with a transudative process.
There was no concern for empyema.
The left chest tube that had been placed on [**2-23**] did not drain a significant amount of fluid despite chest x-ray decrease in lung volumes and increasing fluid.
Initially, the left chest tube had a high output up to 600 to 800 cc per day, as these volumes decreased significantly the chest tubes were placed to water seal, which demonstrated a significant amount of output.
Repeat chest x-rays demonstrated no significant reexpansion, however, there was no significant accumulation of fluid post removal.
It is felt that the patient has trapped lung physiology with scarring of the lungs peripherally.
Infectious disease:  Ms. [**Known lastname 93056**] was felt to have a right lower lobe pneumonia and was given Ceftriaxone at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital on presentation.
The patient did grow MRSA from her sputum and she was felt to have a ventilator required pneumonia.
To workup these fevers she had CAT scans of the torso and sinuses on [**2-27**] and also [**2-16**].
Secondary to an increase in her liver function tests, a right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed, which was unrevealing for ductal dilatation.
After completing a course of Vancomycin for her VAP, the patient no longer developed any fevers and has remained afebrile for approximately one week prior to discharge.
Secondary to her prolonged intubation and poor mental status access for feedings was required.
However, upon initiation of her tube feedings with Respalor these electrolyte abnormalities were not commonly requiring repletion.
She is currently receiving Hydrocortisone and Fluticasone secondary to multiple episodes of hypotension, which were felt secondary to her adrenal insufficiency.
