Admission Date:  [**2149-11-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2149-12-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2079-7-7**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MED ICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known firstname 18404**] is a 70 year old female with a past medical history of high cholesterol, mitral valve prolapse, and recent history of falls and unsteady gait.
The patient's husband describes approximately two to three months of ill health with symptoms mainly consisting of some dyspnea on exertion, breathing trouble, non-specific weakness and several falls.
The patient denies loss of consciousness.
She was treated for congestive heart failure and transferred to [**Hospital1 188**].
Here in the Emergency Room, she was tachypneic and hypertensive, and arterial blood gas revealed ventilatory failure for which she was intubated.
In the Emergency Department, CT scan of the head revealed a question of left frontal early ischemic lesion.
Mitral valve prolapse.
Right carotid stenosis.
History of unsteady falls.
Neck was supple; increased jugular venous distention to approximately 8 to 9 cm.
Lungs with bibasilar crackles.
Chest [**Known lastname 37493**]:  Moderate congestive heart failure, no infiltrates.
CT scan of the head showed negative bleed, question left frontal cortex, hypodense, question edema and infarction.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 70 year old female with question of neurological history who presents status post syncope with respiratory distress requiring intubation, intermittent hypertension and evidence of congestive heart failure.
EKG and head CT scan was suggestive of ischemic process of the brain.
Also, urinalysis is suggestive of urinary tract infection.
This was done without complications.
On [**11-25**], the day of admission, the patient was started on Nitroprusside GGT for unstable systolic blood pressure.
The patient was continued on a Propofol drip, Lopressor, Zocor, Levaquin for urinalysis and Zantac for GI prophylaxis.
Chest [**Known lastname 37493**] was revealing of only mild congestive heart failure with oxygen saturations stable.
The patient underwent cardiac echocardiogram on [**11-25**], which showed positive left ventricular hypertrophy.
No thrombus was seen and ejection fraction estimated at 45% with apical lateral hypokinesis.
The patient's neurologic examination at this time:  The patient squeezes with left hand only and wiggles left toes only.
An MRI/MRA performed on [**11-26**], showed hemorrhage into the left frontal infarction with midline shift; no significant carotid stenosis was seen and right frontal area of apparent hemorrhage, the patient's carotids appeared normal on MRA.
No mass or thrombus was seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No mass or thrombus was seen in the right atrium or right atrial appendage.
No ASD or patent foramen ovale was seen by 2D color Doppler or saline contrast maneuvers.
Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy; left ventricle cavity is unusually small.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic with ejection fraction greater than 75%.
Aortic leaflets appear structurally normal; no aortic regurgitation.
Small pericardial effusion.
No vegetations or thrombi were identified compared to trans-thoracic study of [**11-25**].
Right ventricular function was probably also depressed in the prior study but the right ventricular free wall was less well seen in the prior study.
The size of the hemorrhage and extensive surrounding edema and mass effect is unchanged from the MRI of [**11-26**].
The left lateral ventricle is mildly compressed and shifted to the right.
There is no hydrocephalus.
A second area of hemorrhage is seen as a small 3 mm hyperdense region, high in the sulcus of the parietal lobe.
No fractures were identified.
On [**12-1**], the patient self extubated thought to be secondary to a respiratory muscle weakness and shallow breaths with respiratory rate into the fifties and delta MF.
The patient had no readily appreciated changes in mental status during these episodes.
Neurology recommended an MR of the cervical spine which was done on [**2149-12-5**], showed no evidence of cord compression or neural impingement.
The etiology of the patient's failure for extubation was thought to be possibly centrally mediated.
The patient had a tracheostomy placed on [**2149-12-3**], without complications.
The patient had a CT scan of the chest on [**2149-12-5**], to assess for possible primary pulmonary process, and to assess for previous needs for intubation and prolonged ventilation.
This study revealed no gross evidence of interstitial lung disease, bibasilar dependent opacities, more prominent on the right lower lobe than the left; may represent atelectasis.
A small pericardial effusion and cardiomegaly.
Repeat arterial blood gas on trache mask revealed no elevated hypercarbia above normal.
Increased respiratory rate did not lead to respiratory alkalosis and there was no failure of total volume.
Ischemic transformed into hemorrhagic stroke.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure.
