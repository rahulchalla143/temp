Admission Date:  [**2199-10-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2199-10-30**]  Date of Birth:   [**2138-8-8**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left sided weakness and chest pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old man with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and dilated cardiomyopathy with severe congestive heart failure admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital on [**2199-10-24**] with a two week history of increased shortness of breath and "falling" to the left.
Two weeks prior to admission at the outside hospital, the patient noted left lower extremity weakness which resolved over the next few days.
On the morning of admission to the outside hospital, the patient experienced left arm numbness and weakness.
He denied any associated chest pain.
No loss of consciousness and the patient denies hitting his head.
The patient was admitted to the outside hospital and ruled out for a MI with a troponin-I of less than 0.05 and a CK of 102.
There was no associated shortness of breath.
The pressure lasted approximately 15 minutes and it was associated with new [**Street Address(2) 7093**] elevations in leads V2 through V5 on EKG.
Before leaving the outside hospital, the patient had a MRI of his head which showed multiple areas of restrictive effusions consistent with acute or early subacute infarction in the right hemisphere.
A MRI showed no evidence of carotid stenosis.
At [**Hospital1 69**], the patient was seen by the Stroke fellow prior to going for cardiac catheterization.
He was continuing to have left arm weakness at that time.
On neurologic examination, there was a lack of LT pronation in the left leg and proprioception loss in the left hand.
CT of the head was negative for hemorrhage.
There were small deep parietal strokes approximately 2 cm in diameter.
On cardiac catheterization, the patient was found to have a right dominant circulation with single vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA and left circumflex had minor irregularities, but no flow limiting stenosis.
The LAD had very distal apical thrombus or embolus.
The RCA had minor irregularities and a lesion in the very distal posterolateral branch.
Coronary artery disease status post cardiac catheterization in [**4-14**], which showed normal LMCA, mild diffuse disease with up to 50% stenosis in the mid left anterior descending artery, mild luminal irregularities of the left circumflex with a small OM-1 with an 80% lesion, a small ramus intermedius with an 80% proximal lesion, and a RCA with mild luminal irregularity and 40% mid vessel narrowing.
Dilated cardiomyopathy.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Cardiac:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
No carotid bruits.
Diffuse tenderness to palpation.
No rebound or guarding.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
ST elevations in leads V3 through V5.
The patient has dilated cardiomyopathy with poor LV systolic function and apical dyskinesis.
The most liely etiology for MI is embolization from LV thrombus.Patient remained chest pain free throughout the rest of the admission.
Rhythm:  Throughout the first few days of admission, the patient was in sinus rhythm with occasional PVCs.
Myocardium:  Patient has dilated cardiomyopathy causing congestive heart failure.
Although the patient had a mild volume overload by his hemodynamic numbers on cardiac catheterization, he had no symptoms of congestive heart failure.
An atrial thrombus was a concern as the cause of the myocardial infarction.
A bedside echocardiogram was performed on the evening of admission during which no thrombus was visualized.
It showed the left atrium to be mildly dilated.
The left ventricular cavity was moderately dilated with overall depressed left ventricular systolic function.
The right ventricular cavity was dilated with depressed right ventricular systolic function.
There was no aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation, 1+ mitral regurgitation, [**2-15**]+ tricuspid regurgitation.
Small pericardial effusion was visualized.
Given his severe dilated cardiomyopathy, the patient will require anticoagulation.
Renal:  Patient with no history of chronic renal failure.
GI:  On the evening of admission, the patient had severe abdominal pain in the lower region.
This was not associated with rebound or guarding.
Patient attributed this pain to "gas".
Bowel ischemia was a diagnostic consideration given the patient's CVA and probable thrombus in the heart resulting in the MI.
The pain resolved with IV Morphine.
Neurologic:  Patient with parietal infarct resulting in left sided weakness and numbness on admission.
The left sided weakness and numbness had resolved by hospital day two.
Anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Ventricular tachycardia.
Dilated cardiomyopathy.
Systolic congestive heart failure.
Coronary artery disease.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
