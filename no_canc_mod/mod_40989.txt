ACUTE CARE: .
GI Bleed: Patient experienced about 3 weeks of dark stools while on aspirin/plavix following cardiac stenting for NSTEMI.
Patient was found to have gastric ulcer on EGD however no intervention was performed because there was no evidence of ongoing bleeding.
Aspirin was decreased to 81mg PO daily as patient has high lifetime risk for CAD.
Simvastatin was continued but aspirin and plavix were held for acute GI bleed.
Patient's aspirin was decreased to 81mg daily for risk of CAD and antihypertensives that were held for GIB were re-started on discharge.
