Patient in the MICU did not appear to be withdrawing from alcohol, however possible that seizure was secondary to EtOH withdrawal given that alcohol level low on admission.
Alternatively seizure occurred in repsonse to ICH which occurred secondary to fall.
Patient currenty awake, alert, oriented to person, year and knew he was in the hospital although did not know which one or why.
Patient was continued on thiamine and folic acid as patient has a history of severe malnutrition.
## Seizure - most likely secondary to alcohol withdrawal as etoh level on admission was 11 and patient with heavy drinking history as well as prevous history of alcohol induced seizures; could have likely been in the setting of fall with ICH since according to wife, the seizure occured after the first witnessed fall with head trauma.
Alternatively could have had seizure from alcohol withdrawal itself.
Metabolic disturbances such as hypoglycemia less likely given that were normal on arrival.
h/o PE with LOC in the past with IVC filter in place.
No specific neurological deficits noted on limited exam to suggest stroke.
Given likely etiology of seizure, decided that EEG unlikely to be of diagnostic value.
Records from [**Hospital3 2568**] were also reviewed online, and they document history of alcohol withdrawal seizures.
## Fall: Patient without radiographic evidence of C-spine damage, so cleared c-spine with range of motion without pain and no pain on palpation over neck, as per neurosurgery protocol.
Patient with right shoulder pain so consulted ortho, x-ray as above likely chronic old fracture.
Given history of gastritis, guaiac positive stool, and ferritin being an acute phase reactant, this is likely iron deficiency anemia.
Patient needs outpatient GI follow up to discuss esophageal stricture as well as history of GI bleeds.
Patient noted to have orbital fracture on admission, and plastics consulted who recommended:  This is a non-operative facial fracture.
