Admission Date:  [**2166-6-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2166-8-18**]  Date of Birth:   [**2090-6-15**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This 76-year-old male with a history of Type 2 diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency progressed to end stage renal disease, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, history of chronic abdominal pain, who presented with two days of increasing epigastric pain, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, nausea without vomiting.
The patient also complained of orthopnea and shortness of breath with exertion.
The patient had also noticed bilateral lower extremity edema.
On presentation, the patient was found to have lateral ST depressions on electrocardiogram and was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Type 2 diabetes, benign prostatic hypertrophy, impotence, herniated L4-L5 disc, positive tobacco history, history of abdominal surgery secondary to a World War II gunshot wound, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, dizziness not otherwise specified, chronic renal insufficiency progressed to end stage renal disease, status post left fistula placement, chronic constipation, and hypertension.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
His neck was supple, without lymphadenopathy.
Cardiac examination:  The patient was in normal rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, and no murmurs, rubs or gallops noted.
Pulmonary examination:  The patient had bilateral rales up to one-half of the lung fields, with increased dullness.
Abdominal examination:  The patient had a midline scar, left lower quadrant tenderness.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly or mass palpated.
On extremity examination, the patient had bilateral lower extremity edema that was 2+, trace dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Chest x-ray revealed congestive heart failure with right lower lobe atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions.
An electrocardiogram was performed in the Emergency Department, which revealed normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 90, with ST depressions that were new and 1 to 2 mm, with T wave inversions in V5 to V6.
When the patient arrived on the floor, a second electrocardiogram was done, which revealed bigeminy with a rate of 80s, which went to normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 70s, and [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions laterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   This 76-year-old man with multiple cardiac risk factors, originally admitted for abdominal pain, shortness of breath and diaphoresis, was found to have an acute myocardial infarction.
This 76-year-old presented with an acute myocardial infarction.
The patient has ruled out for acute myocardial infarction postoperatively three times in the setting of desaturations.
Initially the patient had a left chest tube for pleural effusions.
A bronchoscopy was performed on [**2166-6-24**], for mucous plugging, and the patient required intubation after that.
The patient also had left lower lobe infiltrates two days postoperatively.
The Gram stain revealed gram-positive cocci and neutrophils.
Culture eventually grew oral flora.
The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2166-8-5**], for copious secretions and failure to wean off the ventilator.
Bronchial washings eventually grew out acid-fast bacteria and oral flora.
Infectious Disease felt that this was unlikely to be tuberculosis, as chest x-rays were not consistent with primary or reactivation tuberculosis.
The patient also had a urinary tract infection that grew yeast on [**7-22**] and [**7-24**].
On [**8-16**], the patient was found to have a large increase in his white blood cell count, and a repeat chest x-ray was obtained.
This revealed worsening consolidation at the left base.
This was suspicious for a left lower lobe pneumonia, and the patient was started on ceftriaxone 1 gram every 24 hours.
The patient was positive for HAVAB for hepatitis A.
Final culture on the patient's urinary tract infection revealed vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.
The patient had a history of constipation, and an abdominal CT on [**7-3**] revealed no diverticulitis, abscess or obstruction.
It did note a distended gallbladder, but no thickening.
A left adrenal mass was noted.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed a common bile duct of 9 mm, with no stone or cholecystitis.
The patient presented with increased transaminases with question of induced hepatic injury.
There was also a question of TPN vs. congestion vs. hepatic steatosis.
The patient had a left arteriovenous fistula which was not used secondary to low flow.
The patient had a history of insulin-requiring, noninsulin-dependent diabetes.
The patient had required aggressive skin care because of a right sacral decubitus ulcer.
The patient had chronic areas.
The patient was provided with a Kainair mattress, waffle boots, and right upper quadrant wound care.
The patient developed what was thought to be delirium related to the long hospital stay and urinary tract infection.
An electroencephalogram was then ordered, which revealed slow disorganized background with bursts of generalized slowing, suggesting a widespread encephalopathy.
