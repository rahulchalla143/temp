Sepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Removal of HD catheter  History of Present Illness: 56M ESRD:PD here w/ lethargy and low blood pressure.
Pt has had fairly difficult course with multiple failed HD access as well as cath infections, recently started on peritoneal dialysis with occasional HD for fluid removal.
Otherwise, was told to increase sodium intake outside of dialysis with some good effect on blood pressure, but recurrent lower extremity edema - which is primary measurement of fluid status.
In addition, over last two days, has developed diarrhea, as well as nausea and vomiting today.
Furthermore, low grade fever, but no chills over last day.
Otherwise, no CP, abdominal pain, occasional shortness of breath, especially today, recent development of non-productive cough over last day, states having decreased appetite.

Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

Once again seen are multiple linear and discoid atelectases of the left mid zone and right lung base.
There could be small bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 56M ESRD HD/PD, admitted with hypotension, found to have coag negative staph line infection.
Hypotension appears to be due to dialysis rather than sepsis.
PNA- The patient was thought to possibly have pneumonia by CXR, as well as a new O2 requirement and cough; therefore he was initially treated empircally with levofloxacin then ceftriaxone ([**Date range (1) 101716**]).
However, repeat CXR was not suggestive of PNA; pt's pulmonary symptoms most likely due to volume overload; therefore ceftriaxone was discontinued.
# Hypotension/lethergy- likely due to intravascular volume depletion (despite total body fluid overload); correlates with timing of peritoneal dialysis.
* Mental status: Etiology of recent MS changes unclear, ddx includes Uremia, infection, hypotension; some improvement with improvement in SBP to >80 per patient's wife.
Discharge Instructions: During this admission you have been treated for an infection of your dialysis catheter and low blood pressure.
You are being treated with Vancomycin (an antibiotic); this medication will be given via peritoneal dialysis for a total of 2 weeks.
*Please call your doctor or come to the emergency room if you experience lightheadedness or dizzyness, confusion, fevers, chills, worsening cough, or any other concerning symptoms.
