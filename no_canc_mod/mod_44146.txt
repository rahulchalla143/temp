Admission Date:  [**2135-6-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-7-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-5-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Enalapril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**] Chief Complaint: CC:[**CC Contact Info 35172**] Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 51 yo male with a h/o ESRD on HD due to amyloidosis (last HD Thursday) who is transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital for persistent hypotension.
Upon returning to his [**Hospital1 1501**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] was noted to have increasing lethargy and hypotension and was transported to [**Hospital **] Hospital, arriving at 3:45 p.m. At time of arrival, he was reported as seeing bright blurred colors in front of eyes and complaining of pain in fingers.
With fluid resuscitation, BP's gradually increased from 60's to 80 systolic, but then dropped to 68/42, prompting initiation of dopamine gtt.
He received cefepime 2 grams IV and morphine 4 mg IV for 6 out of 10 pain in his fingers.
Past Medical History: ESRD secondary to amyloidosis -failed LRRT in [**7-5**] now on hemodialysis (right groin line) inferior vena cava stent Sarcoidosis Pulmonary aspergillosis - on chronic voriconazole Type 2 Diabetes, on insulin Chronic Hepatitis C Hypertension Sinusitis Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Clostridium difficile [**3-8**] MRSA line sepsis Renal osteodystrophy Adrenal insufficiency Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis ([**2132**]) Pancreatitis Bilateral below the knee amputation Right index and fifth finger amputations   Social History: Smoked 1 pack per day X 30 years but quit.
No h/o kidney disease  Physical Exam: VS: T 96.8, BP 110/67, HR 95, SpO2 100% on 3L HEENT: clear OP, MMM, sclerae anicteric CV: S1, S2, RRR, 2/6 systolic murmur best auscultated at LLSB, Resp: Lungs clear b/l but with poor air movement throughout.
Abd: PD catheter intact, distended and diffusely tender, diminished bowel sounds Extrem: Right femoral catheter clean, dry, no erythema or induration.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 50 year old man with history of end stage renal disease secondary to amyloidosis, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Type 2 diabetes on insulin admitted to the MICU for hypotension and lethargy in the context of having the transformer set changed of his peritoneal dialysis catheter.
# Change in mental status: Patient has progressive obtundation with no obvious source on previous head CT. Repeat head CT showing no evidence of acute intracranial process ([**6-27**]).
no MRI, no intubation for imaging, no LP).
Despite continued broad spectrum antimicrobials and continued dialysis sessions and treatment of transient hypoglycemia, pt's mental status never improved and he was not reactive even to sternal rub.
# Hypotension: The initial differential included distributive shock due to infection vs. endocrine vs. cardiogenic.
Given his history of line infections and bacteremia and recent violation of sterile PD catheter field, infectious etiology was considered most likely.
Exam on admission was significant for diffuse abdominal tenderness, concerning for peritonitis.
Also considered was the HD line in right groin as possible source of bacteremia.
He had no other localizing symptoms.
He was started on vanc/cefepime as patient has h/o colonization with both MRSA, pseudomonas.
# Finger ischemia: The ischemia is consistent with history of extensive microvascular disease.
He generally receives oxycodone PRN pain  # Thrombosis: The patient has known extensive inferior vena cava clot burden to level of right atrium and likely involvement of superior vena cava.
There is a high degree of risk associated with anticoagulation in this patient related to history of hemodynamically signficant epistaxis, recurrent epistaxis, and hemoptysis related to fungal lesion in left upper lobed of the lung.
# DM2 uncontrolled with complications: The patient had several episodes of hypoglycemia while on the floor which required amps of D50 to correct.
