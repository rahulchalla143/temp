No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Myxomatous mitral valve leaflets.
Partial mitral leaflet flail.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
Conclusions PRE CPB The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is partial mitral leaflet flail involving the P2 scallop.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricle displays mild to moderate global hypokinesis with an EF in the 40 to 45% range.
There is a mitral annular ring in situ.
There is mild, valvular mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral stenosis.
There is trace to mild tricuspid regurgitation.
Electronically signed by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4901**], MD, Interpreting physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2193-1-16**] 16:07   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 87978**] was presented to an outside hospital emergency department with chest pain and fever.
An echo cardiogram revealed a torn mitral valve chord and severe mitral regurgitation.
She underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed clean coronaries and a balloon pump was placed secondary to poor right heart function.
Infectious disease was consulted on arrival given her fever history and she was placed on antibiotics until her valve tissue cultures returned negative.
She was seen by the renal service for elevated creatinine, which resolved below baseline at discharge.
She had atrial fibrillation and responded with bradycardia to amiodarone on conversion to sinus rhythm.
She was seen by electrophysiology for evaluation of electrical cardioversion or pacemaker.
By post operative day 8 her rhythm resolved to sinus and the electrophysiology service felt there was no need for a pacemaker.
It was advised that she not be started on any nodal agents, but that coumadin be started for atrial fibrillation.
Titrate for INR goal of [**2-21**] for atrial fibrillation.
Acute mitral regurgitation.
Congestive heart failure secondary to #1.
Chronic renal failure due to polycystic kidney disease.
Acute respiratory failure secondary to #1 and #2.
Moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation.
