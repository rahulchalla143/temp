Admission Date:  [**2120-6-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-7-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2057-5-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**] Chief Complaint: Non-verbal, right hemiparesis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p Intubation, mechanical ventilation s/p Ventricular drain placement Arterial line, central venous catheter, PICC placement  History of Present Illness: Pt is a 63 year old man with a hx of HTN, DM, and COPD who went to work as usual today and was last seen normal around 7:00AM.
He was initially examined by the ER resident and the stroke fellow who found him awake, but with a fluctuating level of arousal, non-verbal, not following commands, and with a dense right hemiplegia.
CT scan showed large left putamenal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension.
Family History: Unknown  Physical Exam: T afebrile BP158/80 HR50's  RR14-18 O2 Sat 100% Gen: Intubated, +spontaneous movement of the left arm and leg HEENT:  NC/AT, no icterus or injection, ET and OG tubes in place.
Neck: Difficult to rotate or flex neck, no Kernigs, no bruit CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, Lung: +course BS bilaterally anteriorly Abd: +BS soft, non-distended Ext: no edema  Neurologic examination: Mental status: Unresponsive, does not open eyes to verbal or tactile stimulation.
Grimaces to noxious stim and moves the left arm and leg spontaneously.
+corneal reflex bilaterally,.
Left arm and leg with vigorous spontaneous movement (at least [**5-7**])  Sensation: Winces to pain in all 4 extremities  Reflexes: DTRs normal but slightly more brisk on the right.
There is some expansion of the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], and there is edema in the adjacent periventricular white matter.
The hematoma impresses the left lateral ventricle, but there is minimal shift of midline structures to the right.
Patchy areas of decreased attenuation are present in the cerebral white matter, likely reflecting microvascular infarction.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment: 63 year old man with hypertension, diabetes who was found confused with right sided weakness on morning of admission.
He was intubated due to declining mental status.
CT scan showed large hemorrhage in the left basal ganglia with intraventricular extension.
The location of the bleed is typical for hypertensive hemorrhage.
Repeat head CT showed slight interval increase in left midbrain compression and loss of the paramesencephalic space, with extension of blood into the fourth ventricle.
He was started on mannitol and a ventricular drain was placed by neurosurgery on [**2120-6-15**] given high likelihood of developing hydrocephalus.
After several days in the ICU, he became intermittently agitated and was restarted on propofol.
Initial CSF showed elevated RBCs from the intraventricular blood but no evidence of infection.
Pulmonary: Pt was intubated in ED due to fluctuating mental status and concern for airway protection.
Post-extubation he had difficulty managing secretions and was not oxygenating well.
However, chest x-ray remained clear, without evidence of infiltrates.
Cardiovascular: Pt was ruled out for a myocardial infarction with serial EKGs and enzymes.
ID: Shortly after admission he began to spike fevers and had elevated white count.
LFTs, pancreatic enzymes were also normal, and head CT without evidence of sinusitis.
CSF sampled from the ventricular drain on [**6-17**] still had significant RBCs and a proportional number of WBCs, so still without evidence of infection.
On [**6-23**], patient was less alert than in the several days prior, lungs had increased crackles, and sputum had Gram-positive cocci on Gram stain so he was started empirically on levofloxacin and vancomycin as fevers to 102 persisted, WBC count remained at 14, and it was felt his decreased alertness was likely due to fever and infection.
Fever slightly better on [**6-24**], but then on [**6-25**] spiked again to 102 and WBC count up to 16.
Therefore, levofloxacin was discontinued, he was started on ceftraixone 2gm, and vancomycin was continued as CSF was consistent with partially treated bacterial meningitis, especially as he was s/p ventricular drain.
Over the remainder of his stay he coninued to make improvements with some antigravity movement of his RUE and productive language (said "baseball," grandson's name) and was able to follow one step axial and appendicular commands.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: L putamenal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension, likely hypertensive  Discharge Condition: improved, patient is following simple commands and speaks multiple single words appropriately, has some antigravity movement of his right upper and lower extremity.
