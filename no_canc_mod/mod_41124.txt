Exam was notable for being combative and agitated, and [**2-23**] pansystolic murmur best heard over the apex, and slight diffuse abdominal tenderness.
Extremities were still notable for necrotic fingers and feet with 2+ pulses bilaterally.
In ED, CT Head was negative, CT spine showed possible C5-6 diskitis (focal endplate irregularities and sclerosis), CXR showed bl hazy opacities, and CTA chest showed lingular nodule and multiple nodularities w fluid overload pattern and NO PE.
Echo [**2168-8-2**] showed a moderate-sized vegetation on the mitral valve (posterior leaflet) and severe (4+) mitral regurgitation.
Past Medical History: Recent ICU admission for MSSA endocarditis, c/b septic shock, respiratory failure, pneumonia, ATN, hand/foot necrosis, fungal peritonitis, UTI, Hep.
D deficiency, Asthma, Emphysema   Social History: Currently separated from wife prior to admission because of patient's polysubstance abuse.

Different degrees of decreased FLAIR intensity involving some of the multiple infarcts.
No evidence of acute infarct.
The area of concern corresponds to expected evolution of a focal infarct within the left cerebellum.
No evidence of abnormal enhancement.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Worsening of the bilateral nodular pulmonary densities, most likely infectious versus inflammatory in nature.
There is also worsening of the lower lobe atelectasis and consolidations as well as worsening of the mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
Pulmonary edema is similar in extent.
Increased size of a left adnexal cyst.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST [**2168-7-22**]: Included views of the lung bases demonstrate small basilar consolidations, mild interstitial edema, moderate emphysema, and multiple scattered ground-glass nodular opacities, all improved since the [**2168-7-18**] chest CT examination.
Small left pleural effusion.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Relative hypodensity of the blood pool with respect to the intraventricular septum (2:6) is compatible with chronic anemia.
The spleen is mildly enlarged and contains a splenic infarct in the lateral upper pole (2:12).
Scattered prominent para-aortic lymph nodes (2:32) are slightly enlarged since the [**2168-6-29**] examination.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
There is an abscess cavity seen adjacent to the mitral valve (not as well seen as on the prior transesophageal echocardiogram).
Moderate to severe (3+) to severe (4+) eccentric mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Mitral regurgitation appears similar to slightly worse (severity of mitral regurgitation was likely underestimated in the prior report).
[**2168-8-12**] PRE BYPASS No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is an echolucent area in the basal lateral and anterlateral walls, below the posterior mitral annulus, that demonstrates blood flow within.
The right ventricle appears to dispaly focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is a large vegetation on the mitral valve.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
POST BYPASS There is normal biventricular systolic function.
There is a bioprosthesis located in the mitral position.
No mitral regurgitation is appreciated.
Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened.
Right lower lobe and right perihilar opacities have increased consistent with increasing atelectasis and pleural effusion.
Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacities have worsened, consistent with worsening atelectasis.
Small left pleural effusion has increased.

Ultimately, it was felt that the single desaturation event was secondary to mucous plugging, which was itself secondary to continuous use of passey muir valve.
On [**7-29**] sputum cx grew colonies of Chryseobacterium and STENOTROPHOMONAS (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPHILIA.
As pt was afebrile and had no leukocytosis, ID team felt that there was no need for additional antibiotic coverge as this was most likely benign colonization.
2) Fever likely secondary to HCAP and MSSA endocarditis: The patient was febrile to 102.3 in the ED on initial presentation.
Contributing sources included pneumonia--likely HCAP (sputum culture grew pseudomonas), persistent MSSA mitral endocarditis, possible cervical osteomyelitis/discitis as seen on cervical spine MRI.
In addition, elevated beta glucan raised potential of persistent or recurrent fungal peritonitis; CT was performed, which showed no intra-abdominal or intrapelvic fluid collections.
Given peristant fevers on [**2168-7-29**], a CT torso was performed, which revealed the possibility of another/new infectious lesion in the brain.
For further evaluation, and MRI of the brain was performed and revealed multiple septic emboli with hemorrhagic components.
This was performed and revealed severe (4+) mitral regurgitation was seen and MVR was done on [**2168-8-12**].
3) Right external iliac artery thrombus: This was seen on a non contrasted study in the ICU.
A CT torso on [**2168-7-29**] demonstrated thrombosis of the rt.
ID and Vascular surgery were asked for input as to further specific managment for this finding, if any, over concern for the possible need for anticoagulation given possible nidus of septic thrombophlebitis/ongoing endovascular infection, and recommended heparin drip and would readdress operation after MVR with cardiac surgery.
Serial neuro checks were done while on heparin as pt had septic emboli to brain and had hemmorrhagic components.
Pt required a head CT after starting drip which ruled out hemorrhage.
Heparin drip was discontinued as risk of intracranial hemorrhage outweighed benefit of agressive anticoagulation for clot without interval change and not symptomatic (no wet gangrene of R LE and Doppler pulses of posterior tibialis).
4) C5-C6 chronic osteomyelitis with neck pain: The patient had a head and neck CT that suggested only discitis/osteomyelitis.
There was no evidence of fracture.
She had no focal neurologic findings on exam.
Her pain was treated with oxycodone PRN, and antibiotic thearpy was continued as above.
On [**8-7**] pt complained of R shoulder pain (without neurologic deficits) and this was concerning for acute osteomyelitis- imaging should no signs of osteo.
5) Dry gangrene on extremities: The patient's hands and feet show evidence of dry gangrene secondary to septic emboli.
Her extremities did not develop signs of wet gangrene during her hospital stay.
and recommended outpatient follow up in one month for possible amputation of the feet at a TMA site or via BKA (TBD).
Pt's pain was controlled with OxyContin, oxycodone for breakthrough, and Tylenol.
6) Neuropathic pain: The patient complained of burning pain in her legs that was thought to be neuropathic in nature.
She is not being treated for Hep C currently, and no treatments were started during her admission.
8) Trach/PEG: Per IP, was going to defer downsizing tube before surgeries as pt may need bronchoscopy and trach will be used by anesthesia for procedures.
PEG tube was not used while on medical floor as pt was able to swallow medications and food without difficulty.
SURGICAL COURSE: 47F seen by Cardiac Surgery on [**2168-6-17**] during an admission for MSSA bacteremia and mitral valve endocarditis with multiple embolic events (brain, spleen, R kidney, [**Last Name (un) 1003**] lesions), presumably secondary to IV heroin use.
Her hospital course was also significant for Klebsiella pneumonia/respiratory failure requiring trach (treated with levofloxacin x 8d), acute kidney injury (Cr 3.1, presumed secondary to ATN, secondary to hypotension), E.coli UTI (treated with cipro x7d), and fungal peritonitis (treated with micafungin and Flagyl).
On [**2168-7-18**], pt was sent back to ED s/p fall out of bed with neck pain and agitation.
CXR and CTA chest demonstrated multifocal pneumonia.
Repeat echo demonstrated that the MV vegetation had decreased in size.
However, CTA torso also demonstrated worsening pneumonia.
Csurg was reconsulted to re-evaluate for possible surgical intervention in the setting of continued septic emboli.
[**2168-8-2**] Echo showed moderate-sized vegetation on mitral valve.
Later on the night of POD#0 she was taken back to the operating room for re-exploration for bleeding.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
She is non-weight bearing due to her dry necrotic feet.
By the time of discharge on POD 6 the patient was afebrile on IV nafcillin, tolerating a regular diet but remained on cycled tube feeds to maximize nutrition.
The sternal wound was healing and the pain in her extremities and sternum was controlled with oral analgesics.
The day before discharge she experienced pain at her PEG tube site but it was found to be clean, dry, and intact on inpection.
They are hesitant to remove the tube in this malnourished patient until the tube has been in place for at least a total of 12 weeks due to the risk of peritonitis.
