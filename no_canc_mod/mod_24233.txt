Family History: Mom died of colon cancer at 39 years (refused colonoscopy, DRE at PCP's office).
Sister died of breast cancer.
Mental status was significant for clarity of cognition - after transfer to the floor he was clearly able to understand complex language, instructions and understand complicated information, all in Spanish.
Although it is difficult to evaluate his affect fully, he does seem mildly depressed.
There was a left lower motor neuron pattern of facial weakness.
He has an upper motor neuron pattern of weakness on the right, less so on the left.
He presently cannot sit, let alone stand, without assistance.

Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 112 116 86 324/415 76 64 66  Initial head CT [**2119-11-22**]   There is a 15 x 18 mm intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the midbrain extending down to the basis pontis, level of lower middle cerebellar peduncle, with surrounding edema which is essentially unchanged from the recent exam (13 x 18 mm).
This is associated with hemorrhage within the right quadrigeminal plate and ambient cistern, subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right occipital lobe and a 6 mm-thick right temporal extra-axial hematoma.
Also noted are multiple punctate foci of high density at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white junction in the right frontal lobe (102:52) and the left frontovertex (102:58-9).
While these may represent cavernous hemangiomas, the presence of multi-compartment hemorrhage, as well as the edema surrounding edema these foci is concerning for diffuse axonal injury in the setting of trauma.
There is an incidental likely arachnoid cyst in teh left posterolateral aspect of the posterior fossa, with minimal mass effect on the subjacent cerebellar hemisphere.
There is an air- fluid level in the right maxillary sinus.
No definite fracture is seen.
Foci of high attenuation of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white junction may represent diffuse axonal injury, although cavernous angiomas are a possibility.
Hematoma involving the left dorsolateral aspect of the brainstem at the pontomesencephalic junction is unchanged from [**2119-11-29**].
Right parietal vertex subarachnoid hemorrhage is without significant change from prior study.
Mid brain hemorrhage is identified without evidence of associated enhancement or abnormal flow voids.
Foci of signal abnormality at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction in frontal lobes on diffusion images with two asmall area of blood products in frontal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction and associated small subdural hematoma on the right convexity and tentorium as well as blood products along the subarachnoid space could be related to trauma.
MRA Head: Head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal in the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation without stenosis, occlusion or an aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Hematoma involving the left dorsolateral aspect of the brainstem at the pontomesencephalic junction is unchanged from [**2119-11-29**].
Right parietal vertex subarachnoid hemorrhage is without significant change from prior study.
Stable small right frontal epidural hematoma.
No new focus of hemorrhage is noted.
Brief Hospital Course: Brainstem Hemorrhage Spontaneous hemorrhage into the medial brainstem with loss of consciousness and distruption of function of descending motor tracts and oculomotor control.
Hemorrhage dissects into tissue, resulting in neuropraxic axonal dysfunction, also due to resulting edema.
No aneurysmal dilations were seen (resolution 3 mm), but such an abnormality may have been etiologic.
Hypertension may have also contributed.
Respirtory Failure Owing to respiratory failure, secondary to brainstem hemorrhage, he was initially intubated, but subsequently breathed well after tracheostomy then extubation, using tracheal mask with enriched oxygen between 35 and 50 %.
Cholestasis and Transaminitis See Nutrition above.
Abdominal ultrasound revealed normal appearances, supporting the hypothesis that cholestatic enzymes were secondary to tube feeds.
Urinary Tract Infection, Bacteremia, Pneumonia Blood culture grew STREPTOCOCCUS ANGINOSUS (MILLERI) GROUP, and SPUTUM GRAM and CULTURE revealed HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE, BETA-LACTAMASE NEGATIVE.
