Admission Date:  [**2150-6-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-7-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2125-11-15**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Tegretol / Phenytoin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11291**] Chief Complaint: seizures   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal Intubation  History of Present Illness: 24 yo M with hx developmental delay and [**Location (un) 849**] Gastaut Syndrome, sleep apnea, recently discharged from epilepsy service earlier today after admission [**Date range (1) 85637**]/10 for increased seizure frequency and AED changes, returning with increasing seizures.
As per recent admission note; Mr. [**Known lastname 2427**] was reportedly diagnosed with seizure disorder by the age of three and is thought to have symptomatic generalized epilepsy.
In this setting, he has developed an increase in seizure frequency (now as many as five seizures daily) and status requiring admission on two occasions.
During the last admisison ([**5-2**]) at [**Hospital1 2025**], telemetry was thought to be consistent with [**Location (un) 849**]-Gastaut Syndrome (frequent multi-focal and generalized epileptic discharges, often as semi-rhythmic 2 Hz runs).
There is no known history of recent head trauma.
He continued to have daily clusters of brief clinical seizures, lasting seconds at a time, consisting of eyelid fluttering and upper extremity jerking.
Shortly after discharge today, he had two seizures on his way to his group home consisting of face twitching and right > left arm jerking, lasting over twenty seconds each.
En route to [**Hospital1 18**] ED he had further seizures and since arriving he has been seizing every 2-3 minutes.
While in the ED he continued to have frequent seizures despite benzodiazepines and was maintained on a non-rebreather.
He was initially saturating in the 90s consistently but began to desaturate in association with his seizures into the 70s and was having increased respiratory secretions.
CXR was suggestive of possible aspiration and is currently being closely monitored for respiratory status.
Past Medical History: - seizure disorder - since age of 3 - mental retardation - ataxic diplegia - acne - myopia - atopic dermatitis - hypothyroidism - chronic congestion - frequent aspiration pna - GERD - static encephalopathy - quadriparesis  Social History: The patient has lived at [**Hospital3 19386**] Group Home since [**2147**].
There is family history of DM on both sides of family, thyroid disorder.
HEENT: Long face (right aspect seems smaller than left), pointed ears, atruamatic, no scleral icterus noted.
Pulmonary: Coarse lung sounds b/l (anteriorly) Abdomen: soft, nt, nd Extremities: Warm, well-perfused.
Neurology; MS; Intermittently seizing with eyelid fluttering, bilateral arm shaking, lasting 20-30 seconds at a time.
The background was  usually of mixed frequencies and disorganized, suggestive of an encephalopathy, although abundant beta activity was seen at other times, which could be an effect of benzodiazepine medications.
All of these were characterized by bifrontal high amplitude rhythmic sharp alpha frequency activity lasting for about 30 seconds followed by more persistent rhythmic sharp activity in the right hemisphere but more polymorphic delta frequency slowing in the left hemisphere.
Clinically, these were characterized by rhythmic trembling of the bilateral upper extremities sometimes followed by some more pronounced bilateral upper extremity clonic movements.
Overall, compared to the prior day's recording, there was a significant reduction in the number of clinical and electrographic seizures with only three seen on this day's recording.
EEG [**2150-6-29**] IMPRESSION: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured four electrographic seizures, each lasting 30 seconds or more, that had no apparent clinical correlate.
These were characterized by two per second bilateral widespread high voltage sharp activity with a bifrontal predominance.
Isolated multifocal epileptiform discharges were also seen.
The background was mostly slow and disorganized throughout the recording, suggestive of an encephalopathy, and runs of intermittent frontal delta slowing and focal left hemisphere slowing were seen.
Compared to the prior day's recording, the number of electrographic seizures remained about the same, although they were subclinical on this day's recording without associated upper extremity trembling as had been seen on the previous day.
The shorter bursts of interictal epileptiform activity were also more prominent on today's recording  EEG [**2150-6-30**] IMPRESSION: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
These do not appear to have clinical correlate on video.
Shorter bursts of interictal epileptiform activity of a similar appearance were also frequently seen as were bursts lasting several seconds of high amplitude alpha frequency sharp activity in the bifrontal regions.
EEG [**2150-7-1**] IMPRESSION: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured two types of epileptiform activity both with a bifrontal predominance and both manifest as runs of activity that lasted up to 10 or 20 seconds typically without associated clinical accompaniment.
Although frequent bursts and runs of bifrontal epileptiform activity were still seen, they were less prolonged than on prior days, with almost no periods of epileptiform activity exceeding 30 seconds at a time.
EEG [**2150-7-2**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study due to electrographic seizures characterized by low voltage rhythmic beta activity for five to ten seconds' duration.
The interictal EEG is notable for a slow background consistent with a mild to moderate encephalopathy as well as generalized spike and slow wave discharges with bifrontal predominance at times and, at other times, more monomorphic generalized delta  activity in brief runs.
This telemetry captured nine pushbutton activations for various facial grimacing and mouth movements that did not have a clear electrographic correlate.
EEG [**2150-7-3**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study due to a slow background consistent with a moderate encephalopathy.
Additionally, there are electrographic findings as detailed above in Seizure Detection programs without obvious clinical correlate on video that likely  represent electrographic seizures.
This study captured 25 pushbutton activations for various behaviors including hand wringing, clapping, groaning, facial movements that did not have an obvious electrographic correlate.
EEG [**2150-7-4**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study due to slowing of the background rhythm consistent with a moderate encephalopathy.
Brief electrographic seizures are described above in Seizure Detection  programs; however, no seizures of >30 seconds or one minute duration were seen in this study.
This telemetry captured six pushbutton activations for various behaviors including vocalization as well as grimacing that did not have an electrographic correlate.
EEG [**2150-7-5**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study due to brief electrographic seizures, as mentioned above.
Please note that there is an increase in duration of the low voltage fast activity up to 15 seconds in duration.
This telemetry captured eight pushbutton activations for various hand wringing movements that did not have an electrographic correlate.
Compared to the prior 24 hours, this EEG is slightly worse in that the runs of low voltage fast activity are of slightly duration.
EEG [**2150-7-6**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal extended routine recording for electrographic seizures lasting up to 25 seconds, rhythmic sharp  activity seen independently in the right and left temporal areas, interictal bursts of spikes and polyspikes in a generalized distribution, bursts of rhythmic delta slowing and a suppressed background.
These abnormalities suggest moderate encephalopathy as well as increased irritability which is generalized and multifocal.
CT head IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.
Small amount of soft tissue swelling in the left parietal scalp- correlate clinically.
Consider MR if necessary for assessment of parenchymal changes.
CXR [**2150-7-8**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing bilateral areas of focal parenchymal opacities are unchanged.
No other parenchymal changes.
No evidence of pleural effusion.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 2427**] was admitted to neurology ICU service for evaluation and treatment of increasing frequency of seizures.
Neuro The most likely cause of increasing seizure frequency was noted to be pneumonia.
He was noted to have pneumonia while in the hospital during last admission.
Initially he was having near continuous seizure activity and was given loading doses of dilantin, keppra as well as phenobarbital for control of seizures.
the development of pneumonia coupled with tapered off doses of seizure medications during last admission , probabaly constituted for increased seizure frequency.
He was started on standing diazepam 5 mg q6 h IV for seizure control.
He had good seizure control with addition of dilantin, but after persistent fevers and rash presumed to be caused by this [**Doctor Last Name 360**] (as described below), dilantin was tapered off, receiving his last dose 6/12.
He had occasional brief clusters of [**4-27**] events of head turning and stiffening, lasting seconds at a time, usually no more than [**1-24**] clusters per day, and occasionally received ativan 1 mg after clusters in addition to his standing medications.
Pulm/ID He was noted to have large right lower lobe pneumonia presumed to be secondary to aspiration.
The cultures were sent and he was started on broad spectrum cover for nosocomial bacteria with vancomycin, zosyn and cipro.
He showed clinical improvement in regards to WBC, he remained afebrile and becmae more awake and alert.
He had worsening fevers, up to 104.6 without leukocytosis or left shift.
He also developed a faint maculopapular rash on his extremities, sparing his palms and soles.
Within 48 hours his fever curve had normalized, and suspicion was that the reaction was most likely secondary to the dilantin.
He has been saturating well on room air but it is recommended he use 2L O2 via nasal cannula at night for sleep apnea as started during his last admission.
Diastat AcuDial 12.5-15-17.5-20 mg Kit Sig: One (1)  Rectal once a day as needed for seizure.
Diastat AcuDial 12.5-15-17.5-20 mg Kit Sig: One (1) kit Rectal once a day as needed for seizure: as directed for prolonged seizure or cluster of seizures.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with increasing seizures.
You were found to have an aspiration pneumonia and required intubation.
After this, you continued to have fevers which were thought to be related to phenytoin, which have resolved after this medication was discontinued.
