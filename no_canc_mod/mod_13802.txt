Per review of OSH summary, she was initially admitted to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital on [**2170-6-6**] with increased lower extremity edema, increased abdominal girth, and dyspnea on exertion.
This was associated with decreased urine output, weakness, and nausea.
Hospital course at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital was as follows: - Acute on chronic renal failure - Creatinine 3.5 on admission, up from 2.7 on [**2170-6-1**].
Suspected secondary to ATN vs. prerenal azotemia.
Renal ultrasound WNL.
Evaluated by renal service; HD line not placed secondary to thrombocytopenia, and recommended CVVH to minimize fluid shifts.
- Hyperkalemia - Serum potassium 6.0 on morning of transfer.
- Fluid overload - TTE [**2170-6-12**] with EF 60% and no diastolic dysfunction.
- Aortic valve vegetation - Noted on TTE on [**2170-6-12**].
- Hematemesis - Approximately 500cc on [**2170-6-12**].
EGD [**2170-6-13**] with grade I varices, nonbleeding and erosive gastropathy.
- Hypotension - Midodrine started.
- Hypothermia - Temperature decreased to 85.3 rectal on [**2170-6-16**].
Ertapenem started for suspected intraabdominal process.
- Cirrhosis - Longstanding, and suspected secondary to AIH/PBC.
Complicated by esophageal varices.
Hepatitis serologies negative.
- Thrombocytopenia - Nadir 25, required platelet transfusions.
Elevated d-dimer, FDP; no schistocytes on peripheral smear.
- Hematuria - Right pleural effusion - Altered mental status - Associated with somnolence, confusion, and asterixis.
Suspected secondary to hepatic encephalopathy.
- Suspected malignancy - Followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at OSH.
Of note, she was admitted to same OSH in [**4-28**] with acute on chronic renal failure and decompensated heart failure.
This was also associated with large volume ascites, anasarca.
Mulitple myeloma was suspected for an unknown reason and heme/onc evaluation was reportedly inconclusive.
Review of systems: Unable to obtain   Past Medical History: - Primary biliary cirrhosis with a crossover syndrome, negative AMA and positive [**Doctor First Name **] 1:320; liver biopsy ([**2165-4-8**]) "consistent with a cholangitic hepatitis.
- Systolic heart failure - TTE [**4-28**] LVH, moderate LA and RV enlargment, moderate MR, severe TR and mild AI, global hypokinesis EF 40%; repeat TTE [**5-28**] with EF 60%, mild LVH - Atrial fibrillation previously on coumadin - Chronic renal failure - Type II DM, HgA1C 6.9 on [**1-28**] - Hyperlipidemia - Hypertension - Gallstones - H/O CVA [**2-20**] AVM - H/O Bell's Palsy   Social History: (per OSH summary) Lives alone in [**Hospital1 3494**], but family is involved in her care.
No smoking history.

There is mild congestive failure.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
There is mild bilateral bibasilar atelectasis.
CT head: [**2170-6-16**] No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right.
There is bibasilar dependent atelectasis.
There are coronary artery vascular calcifications.
No pericardial fluid is noted.
CT ABDOMEN: There is a large volume of intra-abdominal ascites or intra-abdominal fluid.
The liver appears small and may have a nodular contour.
There is atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta, but no aneurysmal dilatation.
There is no free air within the abdomen.
CT PELVIS: There is large volume pelvic fluid.
No free air is present in the pelvis.
A few locules of air adjacent to the Foley catheter (2:99) likely represent air within the bladder secondary to Foley instrumentation.
BONE AND SOFT TISSUE WINDOWS: There is body wall anasarca.
There are degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine with grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 on L5.
There are erosive changes at bilateral sacro-illiac joints along the illiac surface.
No suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesions are present.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with atelectasis.
Tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in the right upper lobe may reflect infection or asymetric edema.
Large volume of abdominal pelvic ascites.
Minimally prominent loops of small bowel may reflect mild ileus; no bowel obstruction.
Sigmoid diverticulosis, but no diverticulitis.
Hypothermia falsely elevates hematocrit, interferes with coagulation cascade, and causes electrolyte derangements.
CT abdomen performed showed pelvic ascites but there was not enough ascites on bedside ultrasounds for paracentesis.
She was monitored closely on tele and had intermittent episodes of hypothermia which resolved with a warming blanket.
Also with hyperkalemia (improved from OSH; EKG difficult to interpret given v-paced), fluid overload (maintained oxygen saturation on 2L nasal canula).
Concern for hepatorenal given known liver disease and stigmata of cirrhosis/portal hypertension, although synthetic function is relatively preserved.
GI bleed:  Grade I varices/gastritis > sigmoid diverticulosis given melanotic stool and reported hematemesis last week.
Hematocrit decreased from AM, and concern for falsely elevated hematocrit given hypothermia.
Anemia:  Secondary to GI bleed, as above.
Pneumonia:  Given altered mental status, suspect aspiration pneumonia.
