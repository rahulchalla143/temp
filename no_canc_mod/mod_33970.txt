Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had an 80% mid vessel stenosis and filled distally via collaterals.
The Lcx had a 90% stenosis at its origin.
The RCA had a 30% ostial stenosis and a 60-70% stenosis at the mid vessel.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left sided filling pressures with LVEDP of 16 mmHg.
There was moderate systemic hypertension with a central pressure of 150/63 mmHg.
Left ventriculography revealed an EF of 55% without significant mitral regurtitation.
Volumetric measurements were not made.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Probable diastolic dysfunction.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
40-59% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery.
Less than 40% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
Mr. [**Known lastname 81560**] was worked-up in the the usual preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which showed a 40-59% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery and less than 40% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
