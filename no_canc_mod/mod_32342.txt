No abnormal movements, tremors.
There is stable appearance of subarachnoid hemorrhage into the interhemispheric fissure with associated mild 7-mm left-to-right midline shift.
There are areas of hyperdensity scattered within the right occipital lobe consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage, unchanged.
Moderate bifrontal edema, right greater than left is unchanged.
Stable appearance of right-sided frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage as well as foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No evidence of increased mass effect or hydrocephalus.
Hypodense area along the right temporooccipital lobe likely represents a late subacute infarct and appears unchanged since [**01**] hours ago.
[**2191-8-30**] CT CHEST: The right lung demonstrates a large pleural effusion.
There are scattered foci of increased density in the lung with a 1.2 x 1.3 cm lesion with spiculated margins in the right upper lobe (2:33).
There is extensive paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema in both lungs.
The left lung is otherwise grossly unremarkable without evidence of effusion, except to note several sub-4-mm nodules which should be followed in the left lower lobe (2:23, 24).
The aorta is of normal course and caliber throughout, with extensive calcifications noted.
There is moderate-to- severe coronary atherosclerosis, most severe in the left anterior descending artery.
There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.
The spleen demonstrates a sub-3-cm fluid collection (approximately 46 Hounsfield units) that may represent a perisplenic hematoma or adjacent focal fluid.
No splenic laceration noted.
The intra- abdominal loops of large and small bowel are grossly unremarkable without evidence of free fluid, free air, or pneumatosis.
CT PELVIS: The rectum, uterus and adnexa are grossly unremarkable except to note calcifications in the uterus which may represent calcified fibroids.
There is extensive sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
There is ectasia and focal aneurysm at the bifurcation of the common iliac arteries (2:81).
Bone windows demonstrate a right intertrochanteric fracture with valgus angulation.
There is a compression fracture with near-complete height loss at L1 of unknown chronicity.
There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions, although there are moderate-to-severe degenerative changes noted throughout the thoracolumbar spine.
No rib fractures noted.
Large right pleural effusion.
Extensive emphysematous changes with a 1.3-cm spiculated lesion within the right lung which is suspicious for a neoplasm.
Marked dilation of the intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ducts and common bile duct as well as pancreatic duct.
No pancreatic head mass identified.
Right comminuted intertrochanteric fracture with valgus angulation.
L1 compression fracture of unknown chronicity.
Ectasia of the bilateral common iliac arteries.
Small perisplenic, mildly complex fluid collection.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal arch coarctation.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Eccentric MR jet.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to apical inferior and mid inferolateral hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.
Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild aortic regurgitation  CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Based on [**2190**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
She was taken to the operating room on ORIF, right intertrochanteric hip fracture with intramedullary nail.
Her intraparenchymal hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage were managed non operatively; she was loaded with Dilantin and will need to remain on this until follow up in 4 weeks with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], Neurosurgery.
Thoracic surgery was consulted for RUL nodule and right transudative pleural effusion.
A chest tube had already been placed at the time of presentation, with 800 cc of serosanguinous fluid immediately returned.
Cytology was negative for malignant cells.
Cardiology was consulted for episodes of atrial fibrillation; she was started on IV Lopressor and was later changed to oral with adequate rate control.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Ledgewood  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p Fall Right subarachnoid hemorrhage Right pulmonary contusion/right pleural effusion Right hip fracture   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable; pain adequately controlled; tolerating an oral diet   Discharge Instructions: Continue with the Dilantin until follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], Neurosurgery in 4 weeks.
Follow up in 4 weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Trauma Surgery.
Inform the office that you will need a repeat head CT scan for this appointment.
