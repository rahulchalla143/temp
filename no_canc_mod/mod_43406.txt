CXR [**2135-12-7**]: Multifocal pneumonia.
LENIS [**2135-12-7**]: No evidence of DVT.
CXR [**2135-12-8**]: Unchanged right lung opacities worrisome for infectious process with worsening of the left retrocardiac atelectasis.
If any there is a small right pleural effusion.
There is no evident pneumothorax.
TTE [**2135-12-9**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No significant valvular abnormality seen.
No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation is seen.
Several small calculi are seen within the lumen of the gallbladder.
Mild mural thickening at the gallbladder fundus with areas of ringing artifact, suggestive of adenomyomatosis.
Large soft tissue ulcer and scar overlying the inferior sacrum and coccyx without clear extension to bone.
Focal, small area of bone marrow edema and enhancement in the posterior elements of the sacrum at the level of S3.
This may represent a small focal area of osteomyelitis but is not specific.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 yom with hx of Atrial Fibrillation not on Coumadin, Seizure disorder, Depression, hx of Squamous cell carcinoma of left tonsil and oropharynx, hx of Aspiration PNA with hx of trach, hx of Extensive truncal and LE burn wounds s/p skin grafting, hx of VRE who was brought in from his Nursing home for hypoxemia.
Given his history of aspiration pneumonia in the past per [**Hospital1 2025**] records, this pneumonia was most likely aspiration-related.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Patient developed atrial fibrillation in the MICU, in the setting of infection and levophed use.
Last afib episode was on the night of [**2135-12-11**].
Patient need to follow up with his PCP to have thyroid hormone re-checked.
# Decub ulcers: Patient has stage I and II decub ulcers on the back.
He underwent MRI pelvis to assess for osteomyelitis, which showed a focal, small area of bone marrow edema and enhancement in the posterior elements of the sacrum at the level of S3.
This may represent a small focal area of osteomyelitis but is not specific.
Prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated, and patient should get a follow up MRI in [**6-20**] weeks to assess the size of this focal edema and enhancement.
# [**Date Range 409**] care for Decub ulcers and BKA stumps: The following was the [**Date Range **] care instructions: Pressure relief per pressure ulcer guidelines.
Support surface: [**Doctor First Name **] Air low air loss, Turn and reposition every 1-2 hours and prn, Moisturize B/L stumps and periwound tissue left stump [**Hospital1 **] with Aloe Vesta Moisture Barrier Ointment.
Apply Aquacel AG dressings over the open sites to absorb moisture and decrease local bacteria bioburden Cover with large sofsorb dressings.
Monitor hydration due to increased fluid loss from coccyx/gluteal wounds (similar to burn fluid loss).
Notify MD [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] care nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] or skin deteriorates.
# Elevated Alk phos and GGT:  Alk phos 245 (highest 394), GGT 150 on discharge.
RUQ US showed absence of intra- and extra-hepatic duct dilatation.
On reviewing [**Hospital1 2025**] records, it appeared that patient has a history of elevated alk phos which typically resolves without intervention.
# Elevated INR: Patient was found to have an elevated INR, up to 2.8, while in ICU.
Patient not on coumadin, so this is most likely due to mal-nutrition.
