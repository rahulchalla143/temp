Admission Date:  [**2138-8-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-8-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-11-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: Unresponsive, abdominal pain, s/p intubation, hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation, right subclavian vein catheritization  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 26514**] is a 74 yo man with a history of Parkinson's disease, CHF, and Aortic Stenosis who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab after he was found in his bed altered and moaning at 1030PM.
Of note, he had an unwitnessed fall on to his knees earlier that day at 4:30PM but he denied any pain afterwards.
No abnormalities were noted until he was found altered at 10:30 PM.
He also demonstrated abdominal tenderness and diffuse diarrhea that was foul smelling, brown/black, but guaiac negative.
There was concern for dissection vs. abd source so he had CTA of his chest/abd.
This showed diffuse small bowel thickening but no PE or dissection.
Dementia Aortic Stenosis CHF HTN Anxiety Osteoarthritis Pressure Ulcers of Coccyx (stage 4) and Heal (blister) Dysphagia   Social History: Unable to obtain as patient is intubated.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: VS: 96.8, 125, 77/56, 28, 96% General: intubated; sedated HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: Tachycardic, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly GU: foley Ext: pulses dopplerable , no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Wound: Stage IV decub ulcer on sacrum  DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAM 97.8  69  122/49  97% RA General: following simple commands, somnolent, cough HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: RRR, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi, harsh breath sounds Abdomen: Bowel sounds decreased, +guarding, nondistended, slightly rigid(improving), diffuse tenderness on deep palpation, no organomegaly GU: foley Ext: pulses dopplerable , +1 peripheral pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis, +2 pitting edema.
Mild increased RUE worsened edema.
3. diffuse SB thickening (beginning in prox jejunum) as well as distal colonic wall thickening - near target sign - no signif bowel dilation- target sign suggests acute inflammation or ischemia - vessels appear patent - no free fluid in abd/pelvis may relfect enteroclitis.
4 -large rectal fecal load with rectal tube in palce.
5. thickened bladder wall and bladder calculi - conernign for cystitis- through may refelct chronic irritaiton from stone.
CT Head w/o contrast: No acute process.
Brief Hospital Course: 74 yo man hx of Parkinsons who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with AMS, hypotension, and hypoxia.
ACTIVE ISSUES:  # Hypotension/shock: Most likely septic shock given the high white count of 30.5 on admission, from GI source (infectious enterocolitis +/- ischemic colitis) vs Pulmonary (aspiration, HCAP, necrotizing PNA) vs Urinary (cystitis seen on CT but unremarkable U/A).
Also likely component of hypovolemia given profuse diarrhea and poor PO intake.
Echo did not show evidence of cardiogenic component.
# Diarrhea/GI bleed:  Noted initially to have copious amounts of brown, guaiac negative stool.
CT abdomen revealed diffuse small bowel and distal colon thickening concerning for infection or ischemia due to low flow state.
He was seen by surgery on admission to evaluate for possible mesenteric ischemia, but it was felt that he was not imminently in need of surgery nor was he a good candidate for surgery.
Aspirin was held and GI was consulted, who felt that this delayed hematochezia was consistent with intestinal ischemia, perhaps due to infectious enteritis causing profound volume depletion and low flow state.
His hematochezia had stopped and hematocrit was stable on the day of discharge, no signs of hemodynamic compromise.
If there is interest in further workup, GI suggested it would be reasonable to repeat CT scan in [**1-10**] weeks to determine if there is persistent small bowel thickening, in which case endoscopy could be considered.
Hypoxia: Improved after deep suctioning, however patient was intubated in the ED because of inability to protect airway.
CT chest shows area of consolidation in LLL concerning for necrotizing PNA vs aspiration, so he was started on vancomycin cefepime.
He did continue to have copious amounts of sputum that he had trouble clearing and required frequent suctioning.
His swallowing ability should be continually reassesed at rehab and diet advanced as tolerated.
He should continue the vancomycin and cefepime for presumed HCAP vs aspiration pneumonia until [**8-25**] for a 8 day course.
Likely related to acute infectious process and resulting shock.
CT head w/o contrast negative for acute process.
His mental status improved throughout his hospital stay with treatment of his other active issues.
Acute kidney injury- BUN/Cr elevated on admission to 35/1.7, reportedly normal renal function at baseline.
Likely pre-renal/ATN secondary to profound hypovolemia/shock.
# RUE swelling:  right arm noted to be asymmetrically swollen on hospital day 5.
Venous duplex ultrasound showed no clot.
# Decubitus Ulcer of Coccyx: Seen by wound care nurse, frequent turning, and dressing changes daily.
# Aortic Stenosis: Unknown severity at the time of admission, so echo was obtained and showed mild stenosis.
# Parkinson's Disease: bedridden at baseline and on Sinemet.
TRANSFER OF CARE ISSUES: - Abx:  continue IV vanco, cefepime and flagyl until [**8-25**] - GI bleed/diarrhea:  if further work of hematochezia/diarrhea is desired, consider repeat CT scan of abdomen in [**1-10**] weeks to ensure resolution - Aspiration/secretions:  monitor swallowing ability and advance diet as tolerated.
In the meantime, continue tubefeeds w Fibersource HN w goal rate 60ml/hr - RUE swelling:  Venous duplex ultrasound showed no clot.
Keep elevated and monitor - Aspirin: held in setting of GI bleeding, can restart in 1 week ([**8-28**])  Medications on Admission: ASA 81mg Daily Omeprazole 20mg PO Daily Senna PO Daily Sinemet 25/100mg half tablet TID Lisinopril 2.5mg PO Daily Ergocalciferol 50,000units Q3weeks Tramadol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] plus Q4h PRN Tylenol 650mg PO Q6h PRN Dulcolax Suppository 10mg Daily PRN   Discharge Medications: 1. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
3. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for constipation.
10. bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) capsule Rectal once a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Septic shock Mesenteric ischemia GI bleed Pneumonia Altered mental status Acute kidney injury   Discharge Condition: Alert but not oriented to person, place, time, or event.
