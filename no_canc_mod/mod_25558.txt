The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic p[osition.
No AI or leak.
Postoperatively, he required atrial-ventricular pacing due to complete heart block under the pacer.
