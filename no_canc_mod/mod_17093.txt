Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION: 51 year old woman with a H/O depression s/p purposeful suicide attempt after taking multiple pills, intubated for increasing lethargy, with hypotension and seizures.
# Seizures secondary to overdose: In the MICU the patient experienced generalized tonic-clonic seizures, likely secondary to her buproprion or citalopram ingestion.
The finalized results were pending at the time of discharge; however the Neurology team attributed her neurological symptoms to her exogenous substances and the patient was asymptomatic with no tremors at time of discharge.
There are no specific followup requirements from a Neurology perspective.
# Anemia of unclear origin: The patient was found to have Hct 33.5 which remained relatively stable during her stay, but with an unclear baseline.
The patient had no evidence of GI or other bleeding during her stay and did not require blood product transfusions.
Her anemia can be further investigated by her Primary Care Physician as an outpatient.
# Suicide attempt, secondary to mood disorder:  The patient was evaluated by psychiatry, who recommended inpatient psychiatric treatment once medically stable for discharge.
You were admitted due to overdose of your medications, which caused you to become very lethargic, your breathing to slow down, and your blood pressure to drop.
You were admitted to the intensive care unit with a breathing tube to assist your ventilations, and received IV fluids as well as medications to maintain your blood pressure and prevent toxic effects of the substances.
