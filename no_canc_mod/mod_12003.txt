Admission Date:  [**2180-11-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2180-12-7**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 -year-old gentleman with known aortic stenosis who was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2180-11-23**], with chest pain and ultimately ruled in for acute myocardial infarction.
He presented initially to [**Hospital3 **] and was transferred to the [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for definitive therapy for his evolving myocardial infarction.
Status post colostomy for rectal cancer approximately ten years ago.
Aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.71 cm2 with gradient 49 mmHg.
Lipitor causes muscle pain.
No jugular venous distention was appreciated by the examiner.
Cardiovascular: regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, grade III/VI systolic murmur radiating to the carotid arteries.
Abdomen: soft, nontender, nondistended, with an ostomy in the left lower quadrant.
There is no femoral bruit appreciated.
A small hematoma on the right groin which is nontender.
The patient has a right dominant system with severe three vessel disease.
There is probably 80% proximal left anterior descending stenosis located just distal to the first diagonal takeoff.
There is also 80% mid left anterior descending stenosis just after the second diagonal takeoff.
Left proximal circumflex artery had a focal 80% stenosis before the origin of the first obtuse marginal artery.
There is a focal 80% stenosis just after the first obtuse marginal artery as well.
There is focal 70% stenosis at the origin of the second obtuse marginal artery.
The right coronary artery had a diffusely diseased proximal portion with up to 90% stenosis.
After the marginal artery, there is more diffuse disease in the mid right coronary artery with subtotal 99% occlusion.
The patient had elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
The right ventricular filling pressures were 33/12 mmHg and the pulmonary artery pressures were 33/20 mmHg, consistent with mild pulmonary hypertension.
This site is consistent with moderately elevated left sided filling pressures.
The mean aortic gradient was found to be 49 mmHg, calculated in aortic valve area, using the Gorlin equation with 0.7 cm2, consistent with severe aortic stenosis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Service where he ruled in for a ST elevation inferior myocardial infarction.
He had a left internal mammary artery anastomosis to his left anterior descending artery.
On the evening of his operation, [**2180-12-1**], he initially started to have high outputs and demonstrate evidence of postoperative bleeding.
Blood was evacuated from the mediastinum and there was no evidence of surgical bleeding.
He was able to ambulate to a level 3 and had no complaints.
On the evening of postoperative day four, the patient went into atrial fibrillation with a normal ventricular rate.
ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Atrial fibrillation (resolved, now on amiodarone).
Postoperative bleeding, status post re-exploration and closure.
