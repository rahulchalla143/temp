RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Moderately dilated LV cavity.
Mildly depressed LVEF.
No atheroma in ascending aorta.
Mildly dilated descending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: No MVP.
Conclusions Pre CPB: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are complex (aproximately 1.1cm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild mitral regurgitation.
Coronary bypass grafting x3: Left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery; reverse saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to the third obtuse marginal coronary artery; as well as reverse saphenous vein graft from aorta to the distal right coronary artery.2.Concomitant maze procedure with pulmonary vein isolation using the [**Company 1543**] Gemini X system with resection of left atrial appendage.
Postoperatively Electrophysiology was consulted for  interrogation of Mr.[**Known lastname **] PPM.
He awoke neurologically intact and extubated without difficulty.
Mr.[**Known lastname 23081**] has baseline renal insufficiency and immediately postop his creatnine did rise and peak at 3.0.
He remained in the CVICU for close observation of renal function and improvement.
His rhythm postoperatively went into rapid atrial fibrillation and was treated with Amiodarone and increased beta-blocker.Anticoagulation with Coumadin was resumed for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/MAZE procedure.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Severe peripheral vascular disease with a totally     occluded left internal carotid artery 5.
Renal Insufficiency   Discharge Condition: Alert and oriented x3 nonfocal exam Ambulating with steady gait Incisional pain managed with Ultram Incisions: Sternal - healing well, no erythema or drainage Leg Right/Left - healing well, no erythema or drainage.
