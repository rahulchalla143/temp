Admission Date:  [**2196-11-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2196-11-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2132-5-15**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever and hypotension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64-year-old woman with a past medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, Evans' syndrome, endocarditis, status post aortic valve replacement, mitral valve and tricuspid repair, and a recent history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection after lymphocele drainage who presents from [**Hospital3 2558**] with a fever of 104 and hypotension.
The patient has a history of endocarditis in [**2196-1-25**], status post aortic valve replacement and repair of her mitral and tricuspid valves with an echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of 55%, and 4+ tricuspid regurgitation.
Her recovery from this endocarditis and surgery was complicated by a left-sided cerebrovascular accident in [**2196-1-25**].
She has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation, but had been off of warfarin.
During this hospitalization at [**Hospital6 8866**] she also was noted to have bilateral pleural effusions (right greater than left) which were drained, and were culture negative, and found to be transudative.
This hospital course was also complicated by a splenic infarct and a paraspinous hematoma.
She had developed nausea and vomiting that was guaiac-positive last night at [**Hospital3 2558**].
She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for management of sepsis as well as monitoring for gastrointestinal bleed and was noted to have a heme-positive rectal examination and decreased platelet count in the Emergency Department.
Rheumatoid arthritis.
Atrial fibrillation.
Endocarditis in [**2196-1-25**].
History of endometrial cancer, status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
Status post lymphocele drainage and sclerosis with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus cultures positive.
Dry mucous membranes.
Cardiovascular was tachycardic, irregularly irregular, with first heart sound and second heart sound.
A 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border.
Abdomen was soft and nondistended, mild right upper quadrant tenderness.
No rebound or guarding.
Right inguinal lymphocele with dressing, left inguinal lymphocele with dressing.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation, a right bundle-branch block, left axis deviation, rate 112, T wave inversions in leads II and aVL.
Chest x-ray with pleural effusion on the right with a question of a right infiltrate.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had blood cultures grow 4/4 bottles positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and was treated from the date of admission with vancomycin and gentamicin for one week.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which demonstrated no overt vegetations and was compared with prior transesophageal echocardiogram [**Hospital6 1708**].
However, given the patient's history of valve repair and recent treatment times one month for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus after lymphocele drainage with recurrence of bacteremia and sepsis, the patient will continue on a long-term course of antibiotics for at least six weeks.
The patient was to follow up with her outpatient physicians at [**Hospital6 8866**] for further workup of infection and endocarditis.
PULMONARY:  The patient was noted to have a right pleural effusion with loculation.
Her pleural effusion had received thoracentesis at [**Hospital6 1708**] and was found to be transudative.
