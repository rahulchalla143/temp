She went to an outside hospital where an electrocardiogram showed septal ST segment elevation and inferior ST segment elevation.
At catheterization, the patient was found to have single vessel coronary artery disease.
The left main coronary artery had no significantly lesions.
The left anterior descending artery had a 90% stenosis in the mid segment.
The left circumflex had a 30% lesion in the mid segment.
The right coronary artery had no significantly disease.
Hemodynamics showed normal right-sided filling pressures, minimally elevated left-sided filling pressures, and normal cardiac output.
The final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no dissection, and TIMI-III flow.
Since the patient had an episode of hematemesis in the Catheterization Laboratory, anticoagulation was discontinued.
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Her sister died of a myocardial infarction.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  General physical examination revealed a pale-appearing female in no apparent distress.
Jugular venous distention approximately 6 cm of water.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Extremity examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram disclosed sinus tachycardia at approximately 100 beats per minute.
There was left atrial enlargement.
There were ST segment elevations in leads I, II, III, and aVF, and V2 through V4.
There were T wave inversions in leads V3 through V6.
Her 2B3A medication was not administered due to the patient's episode of hematemesis in the Catheterization Laboratory.
There was severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis at the distal two thirds of the septum and anterior wall and the distal lateral and inferior walls.
The apex was mildly aneurysmal and dyskinetic.
No masses or thrombi were seen in the left ventricle.
