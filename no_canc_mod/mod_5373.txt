Admission Date:  [**2193-3-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2193-4-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2126-2-12**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Trauma Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old man with a past medical history of hypertension, question gout, and a distant history of deep venous thrombosis with no past surgical history.
This accident was significant for air bag deployment, and a question of loss of consciousness.
His GSF was noted to be 14, and his other examination was deemed nonfocal with stable heart, lungs, abdominal, and pelvic evaluation.
The patient had radiographic evaluations including a head CT which showed atrophy but no trauma .
He had a trauma series which was initially read as negative; although final report revealed that he had bilateral pelvic acetabular fracture, and he had bilateral knee films which were both negative for fracture.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to be ruled out for myocardial infarction and to be placed on thiamine, folate, and multivitamins for his history of alcohol abuse and to be placed on deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis with Lovenox, given his history of deep venous thrombosis.
The patient was initially to be admitted for observation, but by hospital day two; although his diet was advanced, he remained somewhat confused and unsafe for discharge.
He had developed rhonchi and presumably had some kind of an aspiration event.
He was intubated electively for both confusion and poor pulmonary status and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient's course was really characterized by slow vent weaning and pulmonary toilet.
His chest x-ray showed infiltrates, and his sputum cultures reflected that the patient actually had staphylococcus aureus in his sputum which was sensitive to oxacillin.
There, he began his physical therapy and was seen by Nutrition who recommended that he have a swallow evaluation.
A follow-up video swallow 48 hours later, however, deemed that the patient did have significant improvement in muscle tone and coordination and was safe for feedings with soft solids or thickened food with the consistency of nectar.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged in good condition, and his only event in the days preceding discharge was that he had some left ankle swelling which was thought to be the beginning of potential gout as he had not been on his colchicine as he really had not been taking p.o.
He was restarted on his colchicine, and his ankle at the time of discharge was nontender but mildly swollen.
