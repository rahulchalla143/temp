Admission Date:  [**2160-8-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-8-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2114-1-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MED  Allergies: Penicillins / Codeine / Kefzol / Strawberry / Vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**] Chief Complaint: pus from right groin hemodialysis catheter, missed hemodialysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right hemodialysis catheter removal on [**2160-8-17**]   History of Present Illness: The patient is 46 y.o.
female with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, HCV, history of stroke, and polysubstance abuse with multiple episodes of hypertensive urgencies who was referred to the ED for hemodialysis and questionable line infection.
She reported pain in her right thigh in the area of her dialysis catheter.
She does however report diarrhea and shortness of breath which improved after dialysis.
Past Medical History: End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis Hypertension Hepatitis C Polysubstance abuse Stroke with residual R sided weakness Asthma Bilateral internal jugular deep vein thromboses Depression with a history of suicidal ideation History of small bowel obstruction s/p resection Septic arthritis  Social History: Unemployed, lives with children, denies etoh, smokes 1 pack/3days.
She initially complained of a headache which resolved with lowering of BP to the 140-150s systolic.
The patient was placed on telemetry for monitoring while HTN urgency resolved.
She ruled out for an acute myocardial infarction on admission.
2) Line infection: The patient presented with right groin pustules believed to be secondary to a line infection in her right groin.
After the placement of the left groin cath, she was noted to have developed pustules on the left near the cath site.
She was placed on the OR schedule for AV fistula on [**2160-8-20**] secondary to concern that the patient had poor compliance and would not return for a graft placement if told to remain on a 2 week course of antibiotics.
The question remained however, if the pustules represented a true line infection vs. superficial skin disease or allergic/contact dermatitis.
They performed a punch biopsy on the lesion and drew cultures for HSV, VZV, bacterial and fungal smears including acid-fast.
The result came back as positive for herpes simplex type I that was cultured from the groin around the cath site.
- [**Month/Year (2) 1326**] evaluated the patient on [**2160-8-17**] and requested a right venogram of her right upper extremity to assess access for possible right cephalo-radial AV fistula.
5) Diarrhea: Initial stool cultures and c. diff.
Apparently, the patient has a history of intermittent diarrhea.
Ova and parasites were also evaluated for in the stool given her history of eosinophilia.
She was given Imodium for symptomatic relief.
She also has a history of small bowel resection that could contribute to the chronic loose stool/diarrhea.
6) Eospinophilia: The eosinophilia appears to be chronic since [**2-6**].
Bumex was discontinued in the MICU with no decrease in her eosinophils.
The possibilities may include Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**] given her history of asthma, medication-induced, or parasitic to name a few.
Their recommendations were that the eosinophilia could be contributed to the vancomycin she is receiving, however, as it is causing her no symptoms and if there was strong suspicion for a line infection, that eosinophilia alone would not be a reason to discontinue the medication.
