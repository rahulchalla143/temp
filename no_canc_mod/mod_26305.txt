His course was complciated by an enterocutaneous fistula and MRSA wound infection.
On [**2103-8-16**] he was taken back to the operating room for lysis of adhesions, takedown of the enterocutaneous fistula, and a small bowel resction.
Post-operatively he had a wound dehisence.
On [**2103-8-21**] the patient returned to the OR for an abdominal exploration with debridement of abdominal wound and fascia and wound closure with insertion of Sergisis.
On [**2103-11-27**] he was taken to the OR for STSG of the abdominal wound.
Postoperatively the patient continued to have problems with drainage of the inferior protion of the wound in the location of the fistula.
A fistula again developed.
His wound was dressed by the surgical team with the ostomy nurse.
There were no complications but he was transfered to the SICU from the OR for close monitoring.
Blood cx later showed Vancomycin resistant enterococcus.
On [**2107-1-10**] he tested positive for Cdiff and he was given appropriate antibiotics to treat all of these infections.
He demonstrated questionable ability to eat without coughing and a swallow study was obtained that demonstrated overt aspiration signs with all consistencies.
[**1-18**] the patient suddenly became confused with slurred speech while resting comfortably in bed moments before.
While examining the patient he spiked temperature to 102, became tachycardic to 120s and was not able to follow commands.
EKG showed no acute changes, stat head CT was normal and he proved to have blood cultures positive for pan-sensitive enterococcus for which he was appropriately treated and his clinical picture quickly improved.
He remained stable for the next week before he developed some mild abdominal distension and serial abdominal plain films showed a persistent dilated loop of bowel in the LUQ.
Tube feeds were held and on [**1-28**] a gatrograffin enema was obtained that showed no colonic stricture/obstruction however was not quite normal due to apparent mucosal and anastamotic abnormalities.
Tube feeds were re-initiated and a video swallow showed evidence that patient could tolerate thin liquids and pureed diet without significant aspiration risk.
He tolerated this diet for several days with 1:1 feedings, however on [**2-3**] he had an aspiration event and was transferred back to the intensive care unit after emergent intubation for respiratory distress.
On [**2-6**] his sputum grew ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII sensitive to gent, imipenem and tobramycin and he was started on imipenem.
He has a small open part of his abdominal incision that is nearly completely granulated but will continue to need wet to dry dressings until completely healed.
any questions or concerns.
