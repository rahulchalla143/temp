negative by Western Blot CSF culture: No growth, no organisms seen on gram stain .
No acute intracranial process including no hemorrhage, mass or edema.
MRI is more sensitive for evaluation of acute ischemia or meningeal abnormalities.
Stable mild parenchymal volume loss in the frontal and parietal lobes.
Chest X-ray [**2144-10-17**]: No acute cardiopulmonary process identified .
Echocardiogram [**2144-10-19**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.

MICROBIOLOGY: Stool: negative for C. diff, camphylobacter, salmonella, e.coli,  Blood: NGTD Urine: CX negative, urine legionella negative Line tip cx: negative  Brief Hospital Course: 48 yo M with PMH of HIV last CD4 311 in [**9-16**] admitted with 2 days of fever, recevied IV abx including vacnomycin and ceftriazone in the ED and developed hypotension requiring MICU admission and pressors.
His vancomycin was changed to daptomycin after he developed a maculopapular rash which was suspected to be a drug rash by dermatology consult Infectious disease was consulted.
He was pan-cultured to look for course of infection but all cultures returned negative.
He has a possible history of vancomycin allergy and a known red man syndrome with rapid vancomycin infusion.
MICU COURSE: Mr. [**Known lastname 6164**] was admitted to the MICU on pressors due to hypotension with concern for sepsis.
He had a prior history of red man syndrome associated with Vancomycin.
His Vancomycin was changed to Daptomycin due to a maculopapular rash which the patient developed on the day after admission.
A TTE was negative for valve vegetations.
Blood pressures were in the 90s/50s but he experienced no end-organ ischemia and was beleived to have low blood pressure at baseline.
He continued to have persistent fevers for the first 3 days of his admission.
All blood, sputum and urine cultures were negative, CXR was clear, LP was without evidence of meningitis.
It was felt that patient may have had a viral URI that was the cause of his initial fever.
Per the ED notes, hypotension developed only after the administration of vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
Unclear whether or not this represented an anaphylactiod reaction particularly given the subsequent development of drug rash and resolution of hypotension after vancomycin was discontinued.
Patient should not received vancomyin in the future given possibility of true allergy.
