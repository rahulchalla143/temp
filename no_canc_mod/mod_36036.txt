Admission Date:  [**2190-9-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2190-9-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2124-2-1**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Tetracyclines / Zinc  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxic Repiratory Failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation   History of Present Illness: This is a 66 y/o female well known to [**Hospital1 18**] with Castleman's syndrome, recurrent aspiration PNA, HTN, who presented to the ED this AM with fever and hypoxic respiratory distress.
Of note, she was also recently at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2190-8-19**] to [**2190-8-27**] for aspiration PNA, fever, and subsequently grew out MRSA (pt has h/o MRSA in sputum in past) and pseudomonas (sensitive to ceftaz/cefepime/meropenem, resistant to levofloxacin).
She had transient hypotension with SBP's to the 90's, thought to be secondary to per-intubation and received 3 L NS with good response of her SBP to the 110's.
Sepsis protocol was initiated.

HTN   Social History: Social History: Used to work as a social worker at the VA. Was at [**Hospital1 **] until [**6-9**] when she was discharged to home.
No tobacco or EtOH.
MMM, OP without lesions.
Neck: supple, no JVD Chest: diffuse fine crackles at bases, no rhonchi or wheezes CV: RRR, nl S1/S2, 2/6 SEM Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, + BS.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Admission CXR INDICATION: 66-year-old woman with hypoxia, shortness of breath and fever status post endotracheal intubation and left internal jugular line placement.
Again seen is a linear density adjacent to the endotracheal tube which terminates at the thoracic inlet.
There has been interval placement of a left internal jugular central venous catheter which terminates at the brachiocephalic-SVC junction.
Again, the lung fields show platelike atelectasis within the left mid lung zone.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Again, the soft tissue surrounding structures show mild gastric distention.
CT Pelvis: FINDINGS: Several acute fractures are identified.
There is a nondisplaced fracture of the left sacrum extending through several sacral ala.
There is a comminuted fracture of the anterior column of the left acetabulum with minimal displacement.
There is an acute mildly displaced fracture of the left inferior pubic ramus.
Chronic fracture deformities of the right inferior pubic ramus, right superior pubic ramus, and the right proximal femur are also identified.
Postoperative changes status post intramedullary rod fixation of the left proximal femur are seen including a proximal gamma nail and femoral neck screw.
No hardware-related complication is seen.
No additional fracture or dislocation is noted.
Multilevel degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine are seen including facet joint hypertrophic changes.
A faint lucent tract in the proximal right femur likely reflects previous hardware.
No additional lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen.
There is a fat-containing umbilical hernia.
Acute nondisplaced fractures of the left sacrum, anterior column of the left acetabulum, and left inferior pubic ramus.
Chronic fracture deformities of the right proximal femur, left proximal femur, left superior pubic ramus, and left inferior pubic ramus.
Status post ORIF of an intertrochanteric fracture of the left proximal femur with no evidence of hardware-related complication .
There is metallic artifact from dental hardware.
This obscures a portion of the parotid gland on both sides, however, there are no masses in the visualized portions of the gland.
At the level of the hyoid and on the right, there is 1.1 cm soft tissue mass just posterior to the internal carotid artery.
This is felt to represent lymphadenopathy in this patient.
Smaller higher density lymph nodes are seen along the left jugulodigastric chain, not significantly changed since a prior CT of the cervical spine, [**2190-9-9**].
However, the lymph node on the right does appear enlarged for this patient and has slightly lower density.
This could represent a lymph node associated with the patient's history of Castleman's syndrome.
No enhancing masses are identified.
There are no fluid collections.
There are multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine without a definite fracture.
IMPRESSION: Well-defined soft tissue mass posterior to the carotid, just below the level of the hyoid, in the right neck likely represents an enlarged level IV lymph node.
PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: No significant interval change is seen.
There is chronic left hemidiaphragmatic elevation and bibasilar atelectasis.
No pleural effusion is seen.
The aorta is generally large but no focal or anastomotic dilatation is apparent.
Persistent bibasilar atelectasis and left hemidiaphragmatic elevation.
STUDY: Right knee CT without intravenous contrast.
HISTORY: 66-year-old woman with right knee swelling and erythema.
Evaluate for fracture or focal lesion.
FINDINGS: Multiple contiguous 2.5-mm axial images were obtained through the right knee without the administration of intravenous contrast.
No bony fractures are seen.
There are no focal bony lesions identified.
There is no joint effusion.
There is narrowing of the joint space with some subchondral sclerosis in the medial and lateral compartments.
Small marginal osteophytes are identified.
There are some vascular calcifications.
There is some minimal subcutaneous fatty stranding seen within the medial aspect of the knee.
No signs for acute bony injury or joint effusion.
Mild degenerative changes.
There are mild degenerative changes, with slight medial compartment narrowing and small marginal spurs.
There is probable diffuse osteopenia.
No acute fracture or dislocation is identified.
No focal lytic or sclerotic lesion is detected.
No joint effusion is seen.
If there is clinical concern for a patellar fracture, then further assessment with an axial image of the patellofemoral joint could help for more detailed assessment.
However, no patellar fracture is identified on the current images.
PATELLA (AP, LAT & SUNRISE) RI; -77 BY DIFFERENT PHYSICIAN  Reason: r/o fracture  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 66 year old woman with knee swelling REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o fracture INDICATION: 66-year-old female with knee swelling.
FIVE VIEWS RIGHT KNEE: Again seen are mild degenerative changes manifested by medial compartment narrowing and small marginal spurs.
There is no knee joint effusion.
There is no fracture or dislocation.
Hypoxic respiratory distress - most likely [**2-4**] aspiration event, given her history and CXR findings of no focal infiltrates.
Baseline requirement of 2 L NC due to underlying restrictive lung disease, and she did well post extubation and was at  baseline O2 requirements.
In the ICU, she was originally covered with broad-spectrum abx (Vanc/Levo/Flagyl/Ceftaz), given h/o MRSA/klebsiella/pseudomonas in sputum in past.
Although she grew MRSA/Pseudomonas in her sputum culture, it was felt that these are most likely colonizers given a) the likely aspiration event and b) no focal infiltrates on CXR.
While on the floor, Vancomycin d/c'd and she was continued on Levo/Flagyl without recurrent fever, hypoxia, or leucocytosis.
She will complete a 14 day courseo of abx for treatment of her aspiration event.
Given mild CHF noted on CXR (nl Echo [**5-8**]), she was diursed gently.
# L hip pain s/p fall - Pelvic CT was obtained per ortho and showed acute nondisplaced fractures of the left sacrum, anterior column of the left acetabulum, and left inferior pubic ramus, along with chronic fracture deformities of the right proximal femur, left proximal femur, left superior pubic ramus, and left inferior pubic ramus.
There was no evidence of a hardware-related complication from her prior ORIF of her left intertrochanteric fracture of the proximal femur.
#Eosinophilia: likely secondary to antibiotics.
#Resting Tremor: On examination, she was noted to have a resting tremor of (B) UE and her jaw with increased rigidity and cogwheeling.
HTN - restarted metoprolol at home dose of 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
HCTZ 12.5 mg daily was added but [**Doctor Last Name 8196**] stopped because of hypercalcemia.
# Hypercalcemia / primary hyperparathyroidism - she has a h/o primary hyperparathyroidism - seen in the endocrinology clinic/ not an operative candidate.
Fentanyl patch was increased to 75 mcg/daily to treat her hip pain, along with NSAIDs/Tylenol/Oxycodone.
# herpes - During the hospital stay, herpetic vesicles were noted on her right knee, confirmed by dermatology who recommended stating valacyclovir.
# Cervical LN - this should be followed with further work-up in clinic.
