Admission Date: [**2141-4-10**]        Discharge Date: [**2141-4-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2141-4-10**]        Sex:  M  Service:  NB   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname **] is a male infant born at 37 and 5/7 weeks with a prenatal diagnosis of agenesis of the corpus callosum and ventriculomegaly admitted to the NICU.
Prenatal laboratory studies included maternal blood type A positive, antibody screen negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune and GBS negative.
Pregnancy was notable for complete agenesis of the corpus callosum diagnosed by ultrasound at approximately 28 weeks of gestation and confirmed by fetal MRI.
Ultrasound and MRI also noted increased ventricle size as well as colpocephaly and a question of hypertelorism but no other abnormalities.
In the NICU shortly after birth, he was noted to have moderate work of breathing with grunting and retractions and room air saturations of 84% to 85% and thus was begun on oxygen.
HEENT: Not notably dysmorphic, fontanelle small but open and soft, palate intact, no obvious hypertelorism.
Whitish discoloration of cornea bilaterally, left greater than right.
Chest: Moderately aerated, coarse, with mild to moderate grunting and retractions.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory: He was placed in oxygen shortly after delivery secondary to grunting and retracting.
His work of breathing decreased significantly over days [**12-4**] of life and he was weaned to room air.
His initial chest x-ray showed findings consistent with transient tachypnea of the newborn.
He had no apnea or desaturations after his oxygen was discontinued.
He had an echocardiogram performed on day of life #3 that showed a patent ductus arteriosus, a patent foramen ovale and a small ASD, trivial tricuspid regurgitation and a redundant leaflet on the tricuspid valve as well as mild pulmonary artery stenosis.
He was, however, started on ampicillin and gentamicin secondary to his respiratory distress, and he completed a 48 hour rule out.
Neurology: He had a head ultrasound shortly after admission that showed agenesis of corpus callosum.
He had a MRI of the brain performed on day of life #1 that showed no additional structural abnormalities of the brain.
He continues to have slit like ventricles but they were not enlarged and otherwise normal brain parenchyma.
He did have opacified corneas with the left greater than the right.
He did have normal appearance of his optic nerves.
No medications.
Ocular anterior segment dysgenesis with opacified cornea bilaterally.
Physiologic jaundice.
Cardiac murmur found to be tricuspid valve abnormality, redundancy.
