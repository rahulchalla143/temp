Admission Date:  [**2106-5-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2106-5-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2053-9-14**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT: Confusion and hypoxia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 52-year-old, African-American male with a history of mild mental retardation, depression, psychosis, asthma, and restrictive lung disease on a home oxygen requirement of three liters.
He presented from home after feeling confused this morning.
At baseline, Mr. [**Known lastname **]' pulmonary disease leaves him with a chronic, nonproductive cough and limits him from walking any length of time or climbing stairs.
He was in his usual state of health until the morning of admission when he awoke and felt confused and lethargic.
He was unable to eat his breakfast which he states demonstrates a major deviation from baseline.
According to his mentor, he has had episodes of confusion where he is unable to recall the day of the week.
At the time of this interview, he denied worsening shortness of breath, and in fact, says that this is a good day for his breathing.
He also denies increase in the severity of his cough from baseline, chest pain, pleuritic chest pain, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, bright red blood per rectum, abdominal pain, dysuria, fever, chills, night sweats or unexplained loss of weight.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a known mixed restrictive obstructive lung disease of unknown etiology and is followed by the pulmonary team at [**Hospital1 346**], in particular by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4648**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.
His baseline chest x-ray shows an interstitial pattern with a patchy infiltrate on the left lower lobe.
He has a history of multiple presentations to this hospital with symptoms of shortness of breath, confusion, and chest x-rays that show an interstitial pattern.
He has been treated empirically multiple times for pneumonia and asthma flares.
He was intubated once in [**2101**] at which time he had a pneumonia with empyema.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  His past medical history is significant for restrictive lung disease with his last pulmonary function test on [**2106-2-5**] with an FEV1 of 0.92 liters, 36 percent of predicted and an FVC of 1.5 liters which is 36 percent of predicted.
It may be a complicated picture including an interstitial lung process of unknown etiology as well as obstructive sleep apnea, asthma, and possibly a neuromuscular disorder as well.
The patient has a history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and pneumonia.
He had a last empyema which required thoracotomy and decortication in 02/[**2101**].
He also has a history of hypertension.
The patient had an electrocardiogram in [**1-/2106**] which showed a right ventricular dilation.
He has a history of depression with psychosis.
The patient is noted to have a self-inflicted abdominal wound where he stabbed himself in the stomach in [**2100**].
He was admitted for psychiatric hospitalization in [**2102**] with auditory hallucinations and again in [**5-/2105**] with a hypomanic episode.
He has a history of mild mental retardation, history of gastrointestinal bleed from internal hemorrhoids, total left hip replacement status post septic arthritis of that hip, hernia repair, cervical stenosis of C3-4 with bilateral hand weakness.
He has a history of obstructive sleep apnea which was confirmed by a sleep study prior to admission.
He has a history of corneal ulcer status post right corneal transplant.
He has stasis dermatitis on bilateral lower extremities followed by Dermatology with negative .................... in the past.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic diltiazem and lactose.
FAMILY HISTORY:  His father died of a myocardial infarction at age 87.
The patient also reports asthma in his sister.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has attended special needs classes through the ninth grade and worked in hospitals as a housekeeper.
His neck had no jugular venous distention and was supple with full range of motion.
His lungs revealed some inspiratory crackles, left greater than right and decreased lung sounds at the right base.
Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm, slightly tachycardiac, normal S1 and S2; no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.
His abdomen had a large midline scar, positive bowel sounds, soft and obese, nontender and nondistended.
His extremities had evidence of chronic stasis dermatitis, no edema or cyanosis, and his neurological exam was nonfocal.
Chest x-ray shows slight left ventricular enlargement, right pleural effusion, and a lower lobe infiltrate possibly consistent with consolidation.
His electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 109 beats per minute with a normal axis and some new T wave inversions changed from prior electrocardiogram in leads V2-V4.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Briefly, this is a 52-year-old male with severe asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, restrictive lung disease, and a psychiatric history with a recent psychiatric medication change who presented with episodes of confusion, lethargy, and hypercarbia.
PROBLEM #1:  Pulmonary: The patient was admitted with confusion and elevated bicarbonate.
He has a history of obstructive sleep apnea confirmed by a sleep study as well as both severe restrictive lung disease of unknown etiology and asthma.
The patient also has a history of multiple elevated CK enzymes in the past thought to be from a muscle source as well as a markedly abnormal EMG which raised the concern of a neuromuscular component to his hypercapnia.
At the time of his initial presentation, the patient had an oxygen saturation in the high 90s and described his breathing as comfortable.
Because of the concern about a possible left lower lobe infiltrate on his chest x-ray, a fever, and a cough, the patient was treated with a seven-day course of levofloxacin.
Initially during his hospitalization, he was not on BI-PAP and had multiple episodes at night where he would desaturate into the 60s when lying flat on his three liters of oxygen.
He is a carbon dioxide retainer, and one night after his oxygen was increased to ten liters per minute because of his desaturation, the patient became somnolent and confused.
He was briefly transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for observation and placed on BI-PAP with resolution of his confusion and somnolence.
During the remainder of his hospitalization, the patient also had a high resolution chest CT to rule out pulmonary embolism which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
He was continued on his metered dose inhalers and theophylline and had no evidence of worsening of his asthma throughout his hospital course.
He also had no evidence of congestive heart failure on exam and was not felt to have congestive heart failure as a contributing factor to his hypoxia.
He was scheduled for a muscle biopsy to further evaluate his possible neuromuscular disease, but the patient had become increasingly psychotic by that time and was unable to consent for the procedure.
He did, however, start to refuse his BI-PAP at night as he became more agitated and paranoid, although he did not have evidence of desaturation at night after he had completed a course of levofloxacin.
PROBLEM #2:  Cardiovascular:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] has no known history of coronary artery disease and has had no signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure while at [**Hospital1 190**].
His electrocardiogram in the Emergency Department, however, did show some evidence of right heart strain as well as some T wave inversions in leads V2-V4 that were not present on a prior electrocardiogram.
He was ruled out for myocardial infarction with multiple enzymes which were notable, however, for the fact that his CKs were elevated, although his MB fractions were quite low, again indicating possible chronic myositis.
The patient had no episodes of chest pain throughout his hospitalization.
His electrocardiogram was rechecked several times and was stable without any changes from the electrocardiogram done in the Emergency Department.
It also showed some evidence of right ventricular hypokinesis consistent with pressure overload and revealed some underlying pulmonary hypertension.
PROBLEM #3:  Gastrointestinal:  The patient was noted to have mildly elevated liver function tests during his admission, but he did not complain of any gastrointestinal symptoms of abdominal pain.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was obtained which showed no evidence of gallstones or biliary obstruction but did show mildly dilated common bile duct.
PROBLEM #4:  Psychiatric:  This patient has mild mental retardation as a baseline as well as an extensive psychiatric history including manic depression with psychotic episodes.
His mental status declined over several days into his hospital course when he was febrile and had become acutely hypercarbic secondary to being on ten liters of oxygen which caused him to retain carbon dioxide.
He was felt, at that time, to be delirious secondary to his metabolic issues.
A head CT was done which showed no evidence of intracranial pathology.
He was treated with BI-PAP briefly in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and had resolution of his hypercapnia and resolution of his mental status as well.
He was then evaluated by Psychiatry who thought, at that time, that his mental status issues were still largely metabolic in nature.
The last several days of his hospital course were significant in that the patient remained medically stable; however, he continued to have evidence of increasing psychosis.
He began to refuse his BI-PAP again at night and became very distrustful at times alternating with times when he would not want to be left alone.
PROBLEM #5:  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient had a slightly elevated potassium on admission and was treated with Kayexalate in the Emergency Room.
BI-PAP at night for obstructive sleep apnea.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus precautions.
Depression with psychosis.
Mild mental retardation.
Cervical stenosis.
