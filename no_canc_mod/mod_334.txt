She had also been febrile to 101 and had one episode of nausea and vomiting.
Per notes, her abdominal exam was significant for epitastric and right upper quadrant tenderness; positive gaurding; and no rebound.
CT showed a distended gallbladder with wall thickening and a small amount of pericholecystic fluid.
No free air or fluid.
Significant atherosclerotic disease with occlusion of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] and possible celiac and renal artery stenosis.
Her marked obstructive ventilatory defect had worsened since PFTs from [**2115**].
Also with a concurrent restrictive process given her low-normal TLC.
Coronary artery disease- Pt is status post a cardiac catheterization recently at the end of [**2117**] which showed a left anterior descending artery 90% blockage which was stented and her left circumflex artery underwent angioplasty with a balloon.
Stress in [**4-21**] showed a mild fixed septal defect.
Borderline pulmonary hypertension.
Anicteric sclera.
Pulm- Coars breath sounds anteriorly and laterally with very poor air movement.
[**6-14**] CT 1) Distended gallbladder with wall edema and possible pericholecystic fluid.
Intra and extrahepatic ductal dilatation is noted as well as prominence of the pancreatic duct.
Further evaluation with ERCP or MRCP is recommended.
2) Significant atherosclerotic disease with occlusion of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] and possible celiac and renal artery stenosis.
The patient's abdominal pain could be related to intestinal angina.
3) No evidence of diverticulitis.
6) Stable small low attenuation focus in the spleen, which is too small to be characterized.
Cholecystostomy tube in good position with no evidence of fluid collection around it.
Ostial calcifications with narrowing of the mesenteric vessels with no evidence of bowel wall thickening, edema, or fluid.
[**6-26**] CTA 1) No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2) Marked interval increase in left-sided pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis.
No evidence of central obstructing lesion.
3) Unchanged appearance of pulmonary nodules; in the absence of a known primary malignancy, one-year follow-up is recommended to ensure stability.
4) Mild upper lobe emphysematous changes.
Following this, the pt had a good decreased in her pain and her fevers decreased into the 99 range.
On [**6-20**], she developed an acutely more distended abdomen associated with nausea.
At that time, she began to desatruate to 70% with associated tachypnea, accesory muscle use, and tachycardia into the 130s.
CXR showed minimal worsening of a left lower lobe consolidation with prominent bilateral vascular markings.
Following transfer, she spiked to 103.6 and was started on vancomycin and zosyn for a left lower lobe PNA.
She was also started on steroids for her COPD component.
Then, on the evening of [**6-25**], the pt received 1 mg ativan and 4 mg morphine for anxiety then desatted to 100% on a NRB.
Pulmonary saw the pt and was concerned that this acute respiratory failure coud be secondary to bronchospasm.
However, PE was the primary concern to rule out given her acute hypoxia, tachycardia, and relative hypotension.
A CTA was negative for PE however demonstrated a large pleural effusion.
The effusion was tapped producing 1 L of transudative fluid which was culture negative.
However this improved once the line was taken out and returned to her baseline neuropathy which is equal bilaterally.
Furthemore the patient had pain in her feet.
She was noted to have pitting edema to her mid calf.
the patient was also noted to have an ecchymosis on the dorsum of her foot, [**3-22**] a phone falling.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
