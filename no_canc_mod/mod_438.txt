There are most likely present bilateral pleural effusions.
There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax  TTE [**2171-4-5**]: The left atrium is elongated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 6 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation.
Mild functional mitral stenosis from annular calcification.

her symptoms improved and she was sent to the regular medical wards from the ICU.
Her home lasix of 40mg po daily was restarted on [**4-9**] as she had some rales at the R base of her lung and mild shortness of breath.
In addition for BENIGN HYPERTENSION her ACEi had been stopped as noted above and she was started on hydralazine 25mg po q6hrs, her nifedipine was increased to 60mg po bid (from 40mg po bid) and her imdur was increased from 30mg po daily to 60mg po daily.
ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: urine electrolytes consistent with a pre-renal cause but given recent angiogram this also could be related to contrast nephropathy.
Her renal failure improved with time and blood pressure control.
At this point she did not have a PICC or mid line or any other foreign body.
She was afebrile and had no white blood cell elevation, her vancomycin was last dosed on [**2171-4-6**] (1 gram IV), this was likely a contaminant so antibiotics were discontinued.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with shortness of breath due to volume overload.
You had acute on chronic kidney failure likely due to an effect of medications and due to volume depletion within the blood vessel (despite having too much fluid elsewhere).
You had swelling of your lip due to angioedema - probably an allergic reaction to either ACE inhibitors (of which your chronic medicaion vasotec is one example) or augmentin (which you were recently started on for cellulitis).
You had a urinary tract infection.
