There is associated collapse of the entire right lower lobe and displacement of this superiorly.
There is a small left apical pneumothorax.
There are tiny foci of air within the tissues posterior to several thoracic vertebral bodies, and a tiny focus of air within the spinal canal at the T2 level.
There is a hypodensity within the right thyroid lobe, which likely represents a nodule.

CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2200-10-17**] 4:23 PM  CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIA  Reason: Eval for sinus disease or periorbital changes.
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 80 year old woman with fever, R periorbital swelling REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Eval for sinus disease or periorbital changes.
HISTORY: 80-year-old woman with fever, right periorbital swelling; evaluate for sinus disease or "periorbital changes."
TECHNIQUE: Helical 2.5-mm axial tomographic sections were obtained through the paranasal sinuses, coronal reformations were prepared, and all images reviewed in bone and soft tissue window on a workstation.
As on that study, there is circumferentially lobulated mucosal thickening involving both maxillary antra, with probable small mucous retention cysts in their floors, with no fluid level.
Circumferential mucosal thickening involves the maxillary ostia, bilaterally; however, the large-caliber ostiomeatal complexes are patent, bilaterally (is there a history of previous nasal-antral windows and inferior partial ethmoidectomy?).
There is extensive soft tissue opacification of left more than right anterior ethmoid air cells, as well as the frontal-ethmoidal recesses, with near-complete opacification of both frontal sinuses, with hyperattenuating contents in, particularly, the right frontal air cell.
Circumferential mucosal thickening also involves both maxillary sinuses, with fluid levels dorsally Fluid appears to layer dependently in the nasopharynx with "trapped" air bubbles; some these findings may relate to dependent positioning and intubation (the patient does not appear to be intubated at this time).
Note that the petrous apices are pneumatized, with a small fluid level in the left petrous apex air cell, not clearly present on the [**2200-10-10**] study.
Very limited included anterior portion of the brain demonstrates asymmetric prominence of the right frontal extra-axial CSF space, without definite hemorrhage.
There is apparent interval clearing of the subarachnoid hemorrhage within the dorsal aspect of the right sylvian fissure and adjacent cortical sulci.
Fluid layering within the pneumatized left petrous apex, definitely not present on the [**10-3**] CT; again, while this may relate to positioning, infectious petrous apicitis cannot be excluded.
There has been apparent interval clearing of the right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Minimal induration in the right periorbital soft tissues, with no evidence of intraconal (post-septal) process.
She was taken to the operating room secondary to shock and ruptured diaphragm; underwent exploratory laparotomy and repair of her diaphragmatic injury.
A family team meeting was held early on because of the extent of her injuries and to discuss resuscitative measures.
Orthopedic surgery was consulted; she was taken to the operating room on [**10-4**] for Closed reduction of right glenohumeral joint dislocation and closed treatment of both bone forearm fracture with manipulation and anesthesia.
She was taken back to the operating room on [**10-14**] for closed reduction right glenohumeral joint; ORIF right both bone forearm fracture; closed treatment right fibula shaft fracture;ORIF left medial malleolar fracture and closed treatment left proximal fibula fracture.
Currently this has not been an issue as patient has remained unresponsive since off sedation.
She has had intermittent high residuals and was started on Reglan QID.
A CT scan of her sinuses and mandible were performed because of unilateral facial swelling in order to rule out any sinus processes (see pertinent results section).
The swelling has decreased over the last several days.
Her pain was initially controlled with IV narcotics; Morphine and Dilaudid; she did on occassion drop her blood pressure with IV Dilaudid; the dose was decreased.
She did have intermittent fevers and was cultured; her most recent workup was on [**10-16**]  WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2200-10-18**]): No significant growth.
