Admission Date:  [**2129-8-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-9-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-1-2**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**] Chief Complaint: Sudden onset of worst headache in life followed by nausea and vomitting  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Left-sided extended pterional craniotomy for complex clipping of PCOM aneurysm, as well as anterior choroidal artery aneurysm.
Right-sided high frontal EVD placement.
History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 52 y/o female Portugese speaking only from [**Country 4194**] who was at a family party on [**2129-8-15**] when around 4:30pm developed a sudden onset of the "worst headache in her life" followed by nausea and vomitting.
She was brought to an OSH and found to have SAH and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]  Past Medical History: Gallstones ?
No abnormal movements, tremors.
There is a large amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage seen within the sylvian fissures, suprasellar cistern, perimesencephalic cistern, and fourth ventricle.
There is minimal layering of this hemorrhage within the lateral ventricles bilaterally.
There is also a 3 mm aneurysm of the right posterior communicating artery and a 4 mm aneurysm at the right MCA bifurcation.
Status post left frontal craniotomy and clipping of known left PCA aneurysms.
Continued diffuse subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage.
The largest aneurysm measures 7.5 mm x 4.5 mm with a 4 mm neck in the left posterior communicating artery.
Smaller 3 mm x 3 mm aneurysm at the origin of the left posterior communicating artery.
There is a 4 mm aneurysm at the right middle cerebral artery bifurcation and a 3.4 mm aneurysm at the right posterior communicating artery.
Since prior study, a hypodense lesion involving the left internal capsule and external capsule is more apparent, and likely represents an evolving infarct.
There continues to be diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as hemorrhage layering within the lateral ventricles bilaterally.
There is mild-to-moderate non-occlusive vasospasm involving the ACA and MCA bilaterally, as well as the vertebrobasilar system.
Unchanged quantity and distribution of diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, although there is slightly increased amount of layering blood products in the bilateral occipital horns of the lateral ventricles.
Slightly increased prominence of hypodensity in the left basal ganglia, suggestive of evolving infarct.
Unchanged mild spasm of the right A1 and M2 segments.
Mild improvement with persistent mild spasm of the right A2 segment.
Moderate spasm of the left A1 and A2 segment and is unchanged.
Worsened spasm of the left M2 segment and left distal vertebral artery, basilar artery and bilateral PCAs as described above.
Compared to prior study from [**2129-8-22**], there has been interval development of low attenuation of the left anterior temporal lobe.
The diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as hemorrhage with layering within the lateral ventricles bilaterally is redemonstrated.
Unchanged persistent mild spasm of the A1 segment of the right ACA, A2 segment of the left ACA and M2 segment of the left MCA 2.
Unchanged mild spasm of the left supraclinoid ICA.
Unchanged severe spasm of the basilar artery and bilateral PCA.
Verapamil infusion through the bilateral internal carotid arteries.
There has been minimal thickening of the extraaxial fluid collection underlying the left frontal craniotomy possibly secondary to postsurgical changes.
Otherwise there is no significant interval changes.
VERT/CAROTID A-GR Study Date of [**2129-8-30**] 4:07 PM IMPRESSION:  Significantly improved spasm of the basilar artery and both posterior cerebral arteries with only minimal residual left P1 segment spasm.
Minimal spasm of the left A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery.
Minimal spasm of the right A1 segment of the ACA, which is improved since prior study.
Infusion therapy performed with Verapamil via the bilateral internal carotid arteries.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2129-8-31**] 10:13 AM IMPRESSION:  There has been no significant interval change since the prior exam.
Stable size of ventricles with no new intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Unchanged size of small left frontal extra-axial fluid collection, however, there is enhancement of the meninges and left sylvian regions which may represent reactive change secondary to hemorrhage or post- operative change.
[**Last Name (un) **] DUP EXTEXT BIL (MAP Study Date of [**2129-9-5**] 10:20 AM IMPRESSION:  No DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt presented on [**8-15**] as a transfer from an OSH a diagnosois of a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Angiography on [**8-15**] showed multiple aneurysms and the pt underwent a posterior communicating aneurysm clipping on [**8-15**].
Fever persisted through [**8-18**] at which point CSF was sent for culture.
CTA showed non-occlusive VASOSPASM.
On [**8-21**] CT showed unchanged diffuse SAH; increased hypodensity L basal ganglia.
Angiography on [**8-24**] demonstrated slightly increased vasospasm and the CSF final culture showed no growth.
[**8-25**] CT was stable, LENIs were neg showing no thrombus in the lower extremities.
Final blood cultured from initial fever work-up showed no growth.
On [**8-26**] severe vasospasm was demonstrated on repeat angiography and verapamil was begun.
On [**8-29**] the drain was discontinued and CT demonstrated a slight interval increase in size of lateral ventricles and likely the third ventricle as well, following clamping of the ventriculostomy drainage catheter.
Chest x-ray was consistent with fluid overload.
Repeat angiography on [**8-30**] demonstrated vasospasm treated with verapamil; CXR with mild CHF and a new small right pleural effusion, as well as new LLL opacities.
Preliminary CSF culture data demostrated 4+ PMNs with no organisms.
Also on [**9-5**] LENI studies were negative showing no thrombus in the lover extremities, UA was also negative, HHH was discontinued.
CT abd showed Small right pleural effusion and hypodense left renal cystic lesion too small to characterize.
Placement was somewhat difficult due to insurance issues and due to her neurologic improvement family was ultimately able to take pt home with prescriptions for outpatient PT and OT.
