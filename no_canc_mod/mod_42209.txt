Per report, patient had a fall from standing position while outside grocery store this morning, hitting his forehead on the sidewalk.
He was found by grocery store manager; at the time he had normal mental status but complained of bilateral leg paralysis and numbness from above his bellybutton down to his feet.
He had flaccid rectal tone.
No cigarettes or illicits.
Gaze midline, no nystagmus.
No papilledema.

IMPRESSION: No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
NONCONTRAST CT C-SPINE ([**2135-7-31**], [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital): There is no fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine.
There is no prevertebral soft tissue edema and the atlanto-occipital joints are intact.
There are multilevel degenerative changes with anterior and posterior osteophytes with moderate spinal canal stenosis, worst at C5-6 and C6-7.
There is disc bulge narrowing the thecal sac at C6-7.
There is no cervical lymphadenopathy.
There are mild atherosclerotic calcifications in the carotid bifurcations.
IMPRESSION:  No fracture of the cervical spine.
Multilevel degenerative changes as described above.There is widening of the disc space at C6/7, recommend MRI for further evaluation.
No fracture of the thoracic spine.
Multilevel degenerative changes.
4 mm left apical nodule.
Abnormal widening of the C6/7 disc space, with associated anterior STIR hyperintensity at the same level.
This suggests traumatic injury at this level, with anterior longitudinal ligament tear.
Spinal cord signal hyperintensity at C6/7.
In the setting of the extensive degenerative change at this level, some component of the signal change is likely related to chronic myelomalacia.
However, a component of trauma-related intramedullary edema is not excluded.
CT head [**2135-7-31**]: There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or territorial infarction.
Opacification of the paranasal sinuses is consistent with interval intubation.
There is no fracture.
There is opacification at the left base with elevation of the hemidiaphragmatic contour.
The appearance is consistent with pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis.
TTE ([**8-1**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The pulmonary vessels are indistinct, suggesting elevated pulmonary venous pressure.

No evidence of hardware-related complication in these immediately post-surgical images.
Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2135-8-6**] 2:45 PM  FINDINGS:  This radiograph was obtained for assessment of a feeding tube, which terminates within the stomach.
As compared to the previous study, perihilar edema has slightly improved, left lower lobe atelectasis is persistent, and right lower lobe atelectasis has substantially improved.
Small pleural effusions are again demonstrated, with interval improvement on the right.
Brief Hospital Course: # C6-7 CENTRAL CORD SYNDROME: MRI C/T spine revealed abnormal C6/7 disk space widening with anterior STIR hyperintensity at same level suggesting traumatic hyperextension injury.
In setting of chronic cervical stenosis, patient's hyperextension injury likely caused significant cord compression resulting in central cord syndrome.
He was bradycardic and hypotensive(likely spinal shock, see below), managed with pressors.
# SHOCK: Patient was bradycardic to 40s-50s on admission, normotensive, suspected spinal shock secondary to his spinal cord injury.
On HD #2 [**2135-8-1**] patient became bradycardic to 20s with resultant hypotension, so dopamine gtt was started to maintain SBP 90-140 to optimize cord perfusion.
Cardiology was consulted and recommended switching to phenylephrine which is less arrythmogenic; arrythmia subsequently resolved.
The patient was in Atrial fibrillation and blood pressures were stable.
The patient remained intubated, was in atrial fibrillation.
He required a diltiazem intravenous drip for his atrial fibrillation and phnelephrine to keep his systolic blood pressure for a MAP or 65 or greater.
The patient demonstrated slight triple-flexion to noxious stimulus in Bilateral Lower Extremities.
There was no rectal tone noted on exam.
The patient continued to experience some hemodynamic instability when off sedation and was only taken off propofol for 5 minities at a time for exams.
The patient required a lot of encouragement to cough and deep breath and required nasal tracheal suctioning.
The patient was determined high risk for deep vein thrombosis and the patient underwent placement of a IVC filter.
Due to large hemovac output the hemovac drain remained in place.
The diltiazem continuous intravenous gtt for atrial fibrillation continued.The chest xray was consistent with the feeding tube,  which terminates within the stomach.
As compared to the previous study, perihilar edema has slightly improved, left lower lobe atelectasis is persistent, and right lower lobe atelectasis has substantially improved.
Small pleural effusions are again demonstrated, with interval improvement on the right.
The patient continues on po diltiazem and remains in atrial fibrillation.
The chest xray from today which showed Interval placement of a left PICC with tip terminating in the mid-lower SVC.
