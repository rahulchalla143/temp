History of Present Illness: This is a 63 year-old woman with history of CVA and renal transplant in [**2147**] at [**Hospital1 112**], on coumadin s/p CVA and for blood clot in her legs many years ago.
Two weeks ago she banged her right leg which subsequently became red and swollen; she saw her PCP; there was no fracture, and she was started on Keflex for possible cellulitis.
Reportedly there was no adjustment in coumadin dosing.
Patient did well but did experience some mild nausea, and extensive bruising on left wrist, right leg, abdomen.
She also felt very ill and tired.
There was a cellulitic area on the RLE but no fluctuance.
She was guiaic positive, but there was minimal BRBPR.
She was admitted to the MICU given her low hematocrit and bleeding risk.
CT abdomen showed no retroperitoneal bleed.
Past Medical History: - CVA - s/p renal transplant ([**3-5**] to HTN, high cholesterol) - hypertension - hypercholesterolemia - s/p R-hip replacement at [**Hospital1 112**] - history of DVT 12 years ago, diagnosed with hypercoaguable state at that time, ?
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 99.0 BP: 127/59 P: 83 RR: 20 O2Sat: 99% RA Gen: no acute distress HEENT: Clear OP, MMM NECK: Supple, No LAD, No JVD CV: RR, NL rate.
[**4-6**] murmuer LUSB, rubs or gallops LUNGS: CTA, BS BL, No W/R/C ABD: Soft, NT, ND.
Large ecchymosis on abdomen EXT: 3+ edema.
SKIN: numerous ecchymoses on upper extremities; small nodule on volar aspect of left wrist, ?hematoma versus subcutaneous nodule ?gout.
Mildly elevated intrarenal resistive indices of unknown chronicity or significance (in the absence of previous imaging studies).
Anechoic structure in right renal hilum, likely a parapelvic cyst.
Right ankle x-ray ([**4-5**]): Distal pretibial soft tissue swelling without radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
Atherosclerotic disease is seen in the coronary arteries and aorta.
Small hiatal hernia.
Renal lesions in the interpolar region of both the right and left kidney which are not fully characterized on this study.
Brief Hospital Course: A 63 year-old woman with history of HTN/ESRD s/p LRRT [**2147**] presented [**4-5**] with supratherapeutic INR to 24 and hct 15 (admitted overnight to MICU [**4-5**]-->[**4-6**]), now s/p FFP and vitamin K with INR 1.3 and s/p 6U PRBCs with hct 21 and stable.
Her drop in hematocrit (from baseline mid 30s per OSH records) was felt to be due to extensive subcutaneous ecchymoses and GI losses in the setting of an INR >24 on presentation.
She denied any recent changes to her diet or herbal supplements although several other of her medications were recently adjusted.
Acute on Chronic Renal Failure.
Thus the most likely cause for her renal failure was decreased renal perfusion from acute blood loss.
X-rays of her right ankle were negative for osteomyelitis.
As above, coumadin was held due to supratherapeutic INR.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses Supratherapeutic INR Anemia from blood loss Acute on chronic renal failure .
Secondary Diagnoses Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia   Discharge Condition: Vital signs stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized because your INR was supratherapeutic and there was concern of bleeding risk.
Your hematocrit was also found to be very low (15), which we suspect was due to bleeding into the skin and probably a small amount of blood loss into the gastrointestinal tract.
We treated the symptoms with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K to help reverse the effects of coumadin.
We do not think there is any active bleeding.
We stopped the lisinopril due to acute renal failure (now resolving).
This can be taken up to two times daily for pain related to the right leg trauma.
Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you have bleeding, fever, or other symptoms that are concerning to you.
