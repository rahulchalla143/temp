No evidence of pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion.
[**9-15**] CXR: Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged from [**2170-2-27**] with cardiomegaly noted.
No definite effusion or pneumothorax is noted.
No focal consolidations are identified.
Prominence of interstitial markings; mild edema cannot be excluded.
[**9-15**] ERCP: A single periampullary diverticulum with large opening was found at the major papilla.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in partial opacification.
A mild diffuse dilation was seen at the main duct with the CBD measuring 8 mm.
Given cholangitis only limited contast injection was made.
Large amount of pus was seen exuding after placement of stent.

#CHOLANGITIS: She presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with 1 day history of altered mental status and abdominal pain radiating to the back where she was found to have leukocytosis, transaminitis, cholestasis, CBD dilation on CT and possible common bile duct stone.
She underwent ERCP where pus was seen draining from the CBD with mild diffuse dilation of the CBD.
Occasionally she reported abdominal discomfort intermittently for about an hour following a large meal.
COLI BACTEREMIA: She presented with SIRS criteria (leukocytosis w/bandemia, tachycardia, tachypnea), hypotensive requiring transient vasopressors peri-procedurally during the ERCP, and blood culture from the OSH grew pan-sensitive E.Coli.
The presumed source of bacteremia/sepsis was biliary.
# HYPONATREMIA: Baseline sodium appears to be ~130 likely due to SIADH as per prior workup.
She developed a drop in sodium to mid-120s in the setting of lifting fluid restriction post-ERCP.
The importance of fluid monitoring and gentle restriction was discussed with patient and family.
#UTI: She had a positive urine culture from OSH growing resistant E.coli species.
She was treated with three days of ceftriaxone (sensitive) for uncomplicated urinary tract infection per ID recommendation.
# Subclavian Arterial Puncture: During attempted CVL placement there was a subclavian arterial puncture.
There were no signs of hematoma and pt not complaining of neck pain or swelling.
CXR did not show signs of bleeding such as apical cap or sulcus sign.
Mental status improved with treatment of infection as above, and hyponatremia resolved with fluids.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -f/u final results of blood cultures -f/u with general surgery regarding elective cholecystectomy -f/u with ERCP for stent removal -check chem-7 in [**4-11**] days to follow sodium -if worsening abdominal pain or fever or inability to tolerate oral nutrition, please seek immediate medical evaluation as will need further labs and likely abdominal imaging  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
