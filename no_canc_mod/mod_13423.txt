On physical exam the patient was found to have a pulsatile abdominal mass by his primary care physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] scan of the abdomen done at [**Hospital3 **] showed an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with dimensions of 8.1 x 8.7 cm.
The patient denied any history of abdominal pain, back pain or claudication symptoms.
CTA of his abdomen and pelvis revealed that the patient was not a candidate for endovascular repair of his abdominal aortic aneurysm.
A stress test done on [**2197-5-31**], showed a moderate, fixed inferior defect, mild fixed septal defect, and a moderate partially reversible distal anterior defect, global hypokinesis, ejection fraction of 42%.
Congestive heart failure.
Severe emphysema/chronic bronchitis.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Moderate dementia.
Coronary artery bypass grafting times three with left leg vein at [**Hospital 4415**] in [**2194-8-9**].

Abdomen:  Protuberant, nontender, palpable pulsatile abdominal mass present.
There was a well-healed saphenectomy incision on the left leg.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 64, nonspecific ST wave changes present, possible septal infarct, age undetermined.
Chest x-ray showed no signs of congestive heart failure or infiltrates, status post CABG and possible sternal revision.
At the end of the surgery, the patient had equally warm feet with a palpable right dorsalis pedis and a palpable left posterior tibial pulse.
Postoperatively the patient could not be immediately extubated due to his severe pulmonary disease.
An episode of melena was noted with a T-max of 100.9??????.
Over the next few days, the patient had several more episodes of melena and fever.
He was cultured and was found to have E. coli urinary tract infection.
GI was consulted for the patient's recurrent melena and subsequent hematocrit drops.

Biopsy of the left colon showed chronic active colitis with ulceration.
Biopsy of the sigmoid colon showed chronic active colitis.
