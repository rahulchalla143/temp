Admission Date:  [**2104-3-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2104-3-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2057-6-30**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 46763**] is a 46-year-old smoker with positive family history of coronary artery disease who presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital complaining of 18 hours of chest pain intermittent accompanied by nausea and shortness of breath.
On arrival, EKG showed inferior ST elevations.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization that showed one vessel coronary artery disease.
The left main, left anterior descending artery and left circumflex were normal.
Resting hemodynamics showed markedly elevated right and left-sided filling pressures with pseudo-constrictures in a pattern indicative of right ventricular infarction.
Post PTCA he had hypotension and he was transiently started on dopamine at 5 mcg and transiently went into atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 116.
Dopamine was turned off and his atrial fibrillation stopped.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for smoking, nephrolithiasis, tonsillectomy, sleep apnea.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is pain free.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The patient had no hematoma.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  7:30 p.m. on [**8-15**] showed sinus tachycardia of 100, normal axis, PR 204, 2.
[**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevation in V3 through V4 and right-sided leads with [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in V4R consistent with proximal right coronary artery involvement with right ventricular involvement.
SUMMARY:  This is a 46-year-old male with an acute myocardial infarction involving right ventricle, significant proximal RCA clot and dissection status post PTCA and stenting.
EKGs toward discharge had resolving ST changes and CK decreased from 6,000 to 1000 on the 8th.
His cholesterol needs following as an outpatient for levels that were not reflected by his acute hemodynamics.
Had an echocardiogram with the following information:  Left ventricular septal wall thickness 1.4 cm, his ejection fraction was 30%, PR gradient was 15 mm, left atrium was mildly dilated, right atrium was normal in size, mild symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy, normal LV size, overall left ventricular function was mildly depressed.
Right ventricle was mildly dilated with severe global right ventricular wall HK.
Prominent systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
C:  Rhythm:  Patient had runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia for the first 24 hours.
He, during his stay here, would ___________ to 88% but did complain of feeling fatigued and tired prior to presenting as well as he has a positive pressure airway device at home.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Inferior myocardial infarction with right ventricular infarction.
The patient was instructed to use them and to call 911 if his pain was not relieved with two nitroglycerin.
