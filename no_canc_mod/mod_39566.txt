Admission Date:  [**2107-5-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2107-6-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2069-10-8**]     Sex:  M  Service:  MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a otherwise healthy 37 year-old male who had his wisdom teeth extracted on [**2107-5-24**].
By 14:45 he felt nauseous and vomiting.
Could not sit still and was sweating so he went to his primary care physician's office at 13:00 and was sent to the Emergency Department from there for evaluation.
Symptoms though were consistent with a drug reaction, questionable dystonic reaction and treated with Benadryl 50 intravenously, Ativan and repeated doses of Lopressor totally 15 mg intravenously and 50 mg po.
Benadryl 25 intravenously given again as there was no change in symptoms.
Ceftriaxone and Clindamycin were given empirically for systemic infection of possible oral source after his temperature spiked to 102.4.
Toxicology was consulted and felt dystonic reaction not neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No wound infection in the oropharynx noted.
CT of the head revealed a subtle hyperdensity and a few sulci, which could indicate blood or exudate, but otherwise was unremarkable.
Possible drug reaction:  It was felt that the patient's presentation was most likely consistent with a severe dystonic type drug reaction to a combination of Compazine and Flexeril.
An LP was attempted to obtain cerebral spinal fluid to rule out a subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as meningitis.
It was therefore decided to treat the patient with empiric antibiotics.
Since no cerebral spinal fluid could be obtained an MRI with gadolinium was performed to assess for possible meningeal enhancement and thus the suggestion of meningitis.
There was an abnormal signal extending along the sulci of the occipital parietal lobes that was nonenhancing, which was a nonspecific finding and was read as possibly reflecting a subarachnoid hemorrhage, pus or other pernicious material.
The patient continued to spike low grade fevers while on antibiotics and also following the completed course of his antibiotics.
There was never another source or infection found.
They recommended a CT scan of the neck to rule out a retropharyngeal abscess given the patient's recent dental work and this was negative.
It was eventually believed that the patient's mildly elevated white blood cell count and persistent low grade fevers were likely due to blood in the subarachnoid space as will be discussed below.
Subarachnoid, subdural/epidural hematoma:  The patient had severe back pain following multiple LP attempts.
He was imaged with an MRI of the L spine, which revealed evidence of an epidural and subdural hematoma.
It was felt that his blood was most likely due to the traumatic lumbar puncture attempts.
A repeat MR of the L spine revealed basically no change.
Neurosurgery continued to emphasize that there was nothing to do except follow with serial MRIs.
An MRA of the brain was performed to rule out an aneursym as the possible cause for the subarachnoid blood.
The MRI revealed spasm of the basal artery, which was felt to be secondary to the subarachnoid hemorrhage, but no aneurysm.
At the time of discharge the patient still had considerable low back pain that was treated with pain medications and Valium and was instructed to have a follow up MR of the head and MR of the L spine in approximately one week.
Hyponatremia:  The patient developed hyponatremia ranging between 127 and 130.
This was felt due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secondary to blood in the brain and possibly secondary to pain.
He was started on Amlodipine 10 mg a day as this will also help treated the basal artery spasm noted on MRA.
It was felt that this might represent type 2 diabetes as he has a family history of that.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural epidural hematomas in the L spine secondary to lumbar puncture.
Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.
FOLLOW UP:  The patient is recommended to follow up with his primary care physician within one week as well as to have a repeat MRI of the head and L spine within seven to ten days.
