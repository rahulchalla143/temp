A stress echocardiogram on [**2112-3-28**] was stopped secondary to fatigue and was uninterpretable for ischemia.
An echocardiogram showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and mild mitral regurgitation.
There was new hypokinesis in the anterior and lateral walls status post exercise.
History of peripheral vascular disease.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
The abdomen was soft and nontender with positive bowel sounds.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2112-4-18**] which revealed the left main had mild diffuse disease.
The left anterior descending artery had a calcified origin with an 80% to 90% stenosis.
The left circumflex had an 80% stenosis at the origin, 80% stenosis before the first obtuse marginal, and diffuse distal 60% to 70% stenosis.
The posterior descending artery was small and diffusely diseased.
The right coronary artery was nondominant with an ostial 80% lesion and mid diffuse 80% to 90% lesion.
Left ventriculography revealed an ejection fraction of 45% with inferior severe hypokinesis and akinesis.
He then developed stridor and required reintubation.
