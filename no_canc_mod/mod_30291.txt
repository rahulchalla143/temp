FINDINGS:  Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct.
As seen on the CT, there is subarachnoid hemorrhage identified along the sulci in the right frontal lobe with an intraparenchymal hemorrhage which has characteristics of an acute hematoma.
The intraparenchymal hematoma measures approximately 2 cm.
Following gadolinium, several small areas of high density seen and surrounding the hemorrhage and also along the margin which corresponds to blood products but subtle marginal enhancement is seen.
A small area of blood products is identified in the septum pellucidum and small area of blood is seen in the ventricular system which could be posttraumatic in nature as suggested.
A tiny subdural hematoma is seen measuring 2-3 mm extending from the left frontal to occipital region.
No other abnormal areas of enhancement seen.
IMPRESSION:  No acute infarct seen.
Intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe.
Subtle surrounding enhancement is seen which could be noted in a hematoma without underlying abnormality but a followup examination is suggested.
EEG [**3-15**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to the disorganized and poorly modulated background with excessive admixed theta frequencies and bursts of generalized delta frequency slowing consistent with a mild encephalopathy.
This suggests dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the common causes of encephalopathy but there are others.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing although encephalopathic patterns can sometimes obscure focal findings.
There were no epileptiform features and no electrographic seizure activity was noted.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is generalized cachexia.
There is mild aneurysmal dilation of the ascending aorta measuring 4.7 cm in greatest axial dimension.
There is tri-vessel coronary artery calcification and mild cardiomegaly.
Calcified atherosclerotic plaque is noted within the aortic arch and descending aorta.
Evaluation of the lung parenchyma demonstrates moderate-to-severe centrilobular emphysematous changes within the upper lungs.
Within the left lung apex, there is an irregular soft tissue density (2A:9) measuring 1.1 cm in greatest axial dimension.
In the right upper lobe, there is a rounded lesion measuring (2A:17) 1.2 x 1 cm and containing two  calcifications.
In the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, there is a 1 x 0.5 cm soft tissue nodule with adjacent somewhat reticular and alveolar opacity abutting the oblique fissure and pleural surface (2A:23).
A focus of calcification is present along the right inferior posterior pleural surface (2A:49).
There is a small right pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.
However, there is a large partially visualized cystic structure measuring 8.7 cm in greatest transverse dimension in the suprarenal space corresponding to a large right renal cyst on study dating back to [**2131**].
Small subcentimeter hypoattenuating lesion within the right lobe of the liver parenchyma (2A:54) which appears unchanged since [**2131**], likely representing a cyst.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions detected.
Scoliosis with associated degenerative changes.
Infectious versus inflammatory process within the posterior segment of the right upper lobe (image 3A:23).
A adjacent nodular soft tissue density is noted which may relate to this process; however, given partially spiculated margin a malignancy cannot be entirely excluded.
Right upper lobe nodule with calcifications (3A:17) - this is relatively stable dating back to the cxr of [**2131-3-31**].
Ill-defined soft tissue focus in the left lung apex which may be assessed during the three-month followup.
Small right pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.
Coronary artery calcification and ascending aortic dilatation.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2139-3-10**]: There are three foci of small subarachnoid hemorrhage identified.
There is no evidence of epidural or subdural hematoma.
There is no associated mass effect and no midline shift.
No transitorial herniation is identified.
There is generalized prominence of sulci and ventricular system consistent with central atrophy.
There are atherosclerotic calcifications of the cavernous portions of the internal carotid arteries and left vertebral artery.
There is a right periorbital hematoma.
Bone windows also reveal smooth thinning consistent with resorption of the parietal bones of the skull bilaterally, right greater than left.
Given the history of parathyroid adenoma, this could be related to primary hyperparathyroidism.
There is mild mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses without air-fluid levels.
Multifocal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Right periorbital hematoma.
Incidental finding of smooth thinning/resoprption of the parietal skull bilaterally, which is likely related to the patient's primary hyperparathyroidism.
PELVIS (AP ONLY)  [**2139-3-10**]: No evidence of fracture.
CHEST (SINGLE VIEW)  [**2139-3-10**]: No evidence of traumatic injury within the chest.
There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
No acute fractures are identified.
There are multilevel degenerative changes, most severe at the atlantodental interval and between C5 through C7.
At these locations, there is marked joint space/intervertebral disc space narrowing and osteophyte formation.
There is loss of the cervical lordosis, likely related to degenerative changes and/or patient positioning.
The visualized lung apices demonstrate centrilobular emphysematous changes and bronchiectasis as well as mild pleural scarring.
There is no evidence of fracture or dislocation.
Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2139-3-10**]: No fractures are identified.
There is a mild-to-moderate right periorbital hematoma.
There also is a moderate right perilabial hematoma.
There are innumerable small 1-2 mm radiopaque foci within the skin of the entire face, slightly more prominent on the right side.
There is rightward septal deviation with a septal spur compressing the right middle turbinate.
There is mild mucosal thickening within both maxillary sinuses and some of the ethmoidal and frontal air cells.
No air-fluid levels identified.
Right periorbital and perilabial hematoma.
Innumerable tiny radiopaque foci within the skin.
These could represent radiopaque foreign bodies as described.
PELVIS (AP ONLY), FEMUR (AP & LAT) RIGHT PORT; KNEE (2 VIEWS) [**2139-3-11**]): RIGHT HIP, THREE VIEWS: No fracture, dislocation or degenerative change is detected.
Multiple soft tissue calcifications are noted.
Calcification adjacent to the greater trochanter could represent calcific tendinopathy.
Cartilaginous calcification along the right hip joint is consistent with chondrocalcinosis.
Extensive vascular calcifications.
RIGHT KNEE, THREE VIEWS: No fracture, degenerative change, or subluxation is identified.
Again extensive soft tissue calcifications are noted, including vascular calcification and chondrocalcinosis.
IMPRESSION: No fracture of the right hip or knee.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Possibilities include mechanical fall possibly with contribution of R knee pain and visual impairment, versus secondary to cardiac arrhyhmia, versus secondary to rather then cause of SAH.
His follow-up NCHCT showed extension of the SAH in the post-central gyrus (which we hypothesized might be related to cortical venous infarction from the edema) as well as some bilat lat vent occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] intraventricular blood and L-sided small subdural heamtoma.
He had no respiratory complaints but coughed up some sputum, which prompted a CXR that showed some nodules and small L-sided effusion.
He had a Chest CT to follow-this and it again showed multiple pulmonary nodules.
Given this finding, in the context of his smoking, cachexia, and hyperparathyroidism, we were concerned for underlying malignancy and consulted pulmonology who counseled him re smoking cessation and recommended follow-up in their clinic with repeat Chest CT in 3 months.
He needs to have an Oral-Maxillofacial f/u regarding broken teeth from the fall.
