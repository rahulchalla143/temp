Patient relates that he has had nausea and vomiting for about a week, and yesterday he had coffee ground emesis, about 3-4 episodes.
He also had a dark, black colored bowel movement this morning as well, at which time he began to feel dizzy and lightheaded, so he called the paramedics.
He has had significant nausea and vomiting for several days, and reports he has had virtually no PO intake.
He was noted to have guaiac positive stool.
NG lavage had coffee-ground material that cleared.
Review of Systems: Denies any fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath.
No dyspnea, PND, orthopnea, leg edema, no change in abdominal girth.
Nausea and vomiting as noted in HPI.
No changes in diet or unusual food intake--patient states he's only had a glass of milk over last few days.
No travel or sick contacts.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: -ETOH cirrhosis with known portal HTN and hx Grade I varices and  gastropathy -partial portal vein thrombosis [**8-26**] -hx alcoholic hepatitis -hx upper GI bleed from distal esophagitis -hx ascites with 2 large volume paracentesis (8 liters each time  per patient) in [**Month (only) 216**] and [**2157-9-22**] -lower GI bleed from hemorrhoids -iron deficiency anemia -umbilical hernia with recent reduction in ED -depression -HTN   Social History: Social History: Long history of EtOH abuse.
Formerly employed as an electrician, however currently unable to drive due to EtOH-related driving suspension.

Skin- Ruddy complexion, few cherry angiomas, no palmar erythema or spider angiomas.
STUDIES: ========= EKG [**2159-12-3**] Baseline artifact Sinus tachycardia Q-Tc interval appears prolonged but is difficult to measure Clinical correlation is suggested Since previous tracing of [**2159-2-10**], sinus tachycardia now present but otherwise baseline artifact on both tracing makes comparison difficult .
LINE PLACEMENT  [**2159-12-6**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2158-4-27**], there is no change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.
Mild cardiomegaly persists, but no acute pneumonia.
EKG [**2159-12-6**] Sinus tachycardia with non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Compared to the prior tracing of [**2159-12-3**] no diagnostic interval change.
Brief Hospital Course: # Hematemesis/Melena:  Patient presented with coffee ground emesis and melena in the setting of nausea, vomiting, and poor PO intake for 1 week.
Hepatology was consulted, and performed EGD which showed esophagitis and portal hypertensive gastropathy.
He continued taking nadolol for his known esophageal varices.
This showed evidence of hemorroids.
# Cirrhosis:   Patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis.
No ascites appreciated on exam, no other stigmata of liver failure noted (no asterixis, no palmar erythema, no ascites).
U/S in [**8-28**] did not reveal any HCC or visualize the portal vein, AFP was 2.9.
Liver enzymes slightly elevated on admission, but trended down.
Ammonia level elevated, but no evidence of encephoalopathy.
His lactulose was initially held as he was agitated and not tolerating PO.
He subsequently had evidence of encephalopathy (positive asterixis) and his lactulose was continued TID and Rifaxamin was started.
developed acute delerium, confusion, tremulousness, likely c/w alcohol withdrawal 48 hours into hospitalization.
# Hypophosphatemia: Hypophos noted in alcoholics often, 12 hours after admission due to low reserve, shifting intracellularly.
Low platelet count could be secondary to liver disease, while low HCT could be due to RBC loss from GI tract or anemia of chronic disease.
Triglycerides WNL, making Zieve syndrome less likely (hemolytic anemia of alcoholics).
However his borderline pancytopenia may also represent systemic process, such as malignancy or viral infection.
More likely due to overall chronic disease state and malnutrition, although patient has fairly good albumin.
HCO3 low, but likely respiratory alkalosis as patient is likely overbreathing in the setting of alcohol withdrawal.
# HTN: Holding at present given potential for losses, low BP.
You had an EGD which showed evidence of inflammation of your esophagus called esophagitis and portal gastropathy.
Given your history of cirrhosis in your liver, you were started on a medication called Rifaxamin.
You also had a few episodes of blood with your bowel movements.
You had a sigmoidoscopy which showed evidence of hemorroids that are probably causing the blood in your bowels.
Your Lisinopril was held because you had some low blood pressure.
