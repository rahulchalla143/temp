Admission Date:  [**2145-9-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-9-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-10-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with one stent placed.
History of Present Illness: 43 y/o male with h/o HTN who developed SSCP nonradiating associated with arm/feet tingling around 12:30PM.
He felt a similar pain 1 month ago after being involved in a fight and being punched in the chest.
No past history of DOE, orthopnea, or PND.
The patient states that he was driving and developed SSCP and he pulled over and called the ambulance.
He was taken to [**Hospital3 **] and his EKG revealed STE in anterolateral leads.
[**Hospital1 18**] cath revealed normal hemodynamics, 99% LAD lesion with thrombus s/p thrombectomy.
No distal embolization.
He still c/o CP with no improvement after cath.
No SOB or diapharesis.
Past Medical History: PMH: HTN .
Pulm: CTAB, no wheezes or crackles Abd: Soft, NT/ND with normoactive BS.
The LMCA had no angiographic evidence of flow limiting stenosis.
The LAD had a 99% proximal occlusion with freshthrombus which was excised with an exciser and export catheter.The LCXhadnoangiographic evidence of flow limiting stenosis.
The RCA was a dominant vessel and had no angiographic evidence of flow limiting stenosis.
Residual distal LAD thrombus partially lysed with manual manipulation.
Single vessel coronary artery disease.
Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca/stenting and thrombectomy of the LAD.
Echo [**2145-9-8**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum and anterior walls and distal inferior wall.
The apex is mildly anerysmal and mildly dyskinetic.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: mid anterior - hypo; mid anteroseptal - hypo; anterior apex - akinetic; septal apex- akinetic; inferior apex - akinetic; apex - dyskinetic; remaining LV segments contract normally.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD lesion).
Mild mitral regurgitation.
EF 35%  Brief Hospital Course: 43 y/o male with h/o HTN who presented to OSH with STEMI and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization and management.
Cardiac/Ischemia/Pump The patient was found to have an STEMI at OSH and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization and management.
He was found to have a large proximal LAD lesion which was stented with a Cypher stent x 1 and underwent thrombectomy.
He still c/o chest pain post-cath but resolved within several hours.
He was on an integrillin gtt post cath which remained for 48 hours post-cath secondary to large thrombus componenet to LAD lesion.
He had an echo performed the next day after cath which revealed apical akinesis and he was started on a heparin gtt for prevention of thrombus formation.
Due to patient's age and relative lack of risk factors, a urine tox screen was sent and was negative for cocaine.
The pattern is consistent with anemia of chronic disease but unclear etiology.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: ST elevation myocardial infarction with placement of stent Congestive Heart Failure Apical Akinesis started on Coumadin .
Secondary: Hypertension   Discharge Condition: The patient was discharged hemodynamically stable, afebrile with appropriate follow up.
Please call your PCP or seek medical attention in the ED if you experience worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or any other concerning symptom.
