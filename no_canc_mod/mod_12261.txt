She was taken to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]-[**Last Name (un) 4068**], where she was found to be in rapid afib with rate 130s; given levaquin+flagyl for "respiratory distress" (assume pna); head CT was read as normal, and CT c-spine was normal (no fracture), thus collar taken off.
Family denies other recent illnesses or c/o.
Past Medical History: htn (dx'ed earlier this year) hypothyroid arthritis s/p knee arthroscopy s/p cataract surgery macular degeneration  Social History: Lives alone in [**Hospital3 **]; no tob, no etoh - walks, but some limited mobility because of arthritis   Family History: No strokes or sz in family  Physical Exam: T 101.6  HR 110-130  BP 177/66  RR 20s on vent, 94-98% on 70%fio2 General: intubated; turned off propofol 5-10 min prior to exam HEENT: moist mucus membranes, ET tube in place Neck: some rigidity, no bruits Heart: irreg, irreg, tachy Lungs: rhonchorous anteriorly/laterally Abdomen: soft, nontender +bs Extremities: warm, well-perfused Skin: raised red convergent plaques over R torso in a horizontal linear distribution  Mental Status: Unresponsive to verbal; grimace and spont mvmt of 3 limbs to sternal rub, min.
Cranial Nerves: Could not visualize fundi due to small pupil size; both pupils react 2->1mm, equal.
No obvious facial asymmetry, but ET tube in place.
Sensorimotor: Grimace to sternal rub, with some eye-opening; brisk w/d RUE, RLE, w/d LLE not as vigorous as contralateral side; flaccid LUE that did not w/d.
Admission CT Head: Subtle hypodensity, loss of grey/white distinction, and slight effacement of cortical sulci of the right frontal and temporal lobes consistent with acute right MCA territory infarction .
There is markedly increased mass effect, with severe effacement of the right lateral ventricle and approximately 15 mm leftward shift of the septum pellucidum.
There is also a small area of infarction within the right occipital lobe, which presumably represents entrapment of the right posterior cerebral artery as it crosses the region of the tentorial incisura.
In that light, there is marked right-sided uncal and hippocampal herniation with moderate obstructive dilatation of the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] tip.
While the posterior fossa images are degraded by motion artifacts, no overt tonsillar herniation is seen.
The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures display no new abnormalities.
Extensive uncal, hippocampal and subfalcine herniation.
She was noted to be in atrial fibrillation, however a decision was made to hold off on anti-coagulation until the size of her infarct could be determined to avoid hemorrhagic conversion.
The next morning she was noted to have a dilated R pupil, so stat Head CT was performed, and showed hemorrhage into the area of infarction and brainstem herniation.
