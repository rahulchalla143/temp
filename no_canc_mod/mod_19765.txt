Admission Date:  [**2200-5-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-5-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2121-11-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**] Chief Complaint: atrial fibrillation with RVR  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 78M w hx of PE, lupus anticoagulant, GERD, GI bleed, recent d/c from [**Hospital1 18**] for eval of CP (s/p stents to OM1 and D1) p/w Atrial fibrillation with RVR and CP.
This morning, awoke to bathroom then acutely became SOB with 8/10 CP.
Given ntg x3 with some relief.
Remained in afib but rate improved to 100-110.
Past Medical History: -CAD: recent ST elevations in inferior leads and s/p c cath at the [**Hospital1 18**] [**2200-5-23**]: Multiple balloon inflations and deployment of  4 stents were performed: two to the OM1 branch of the LAD, and two to the D1 branch of the LCx.
-GERD -R thigh hematoma from lovenox -R CEA--[**2190**], pt had presented with "forgetfulness", and underwent CEA at [**Hospital1 112**] -Anemia -Back surgery -Lupus anticoagulant -Femur fracture [**2196**], surgical repair -GIB, pt does not recall in past.
Never had EGD/Colonoscopy per him -TB, lung surgery x3 ([**2152**], R and L resections at [**Hospital 912**] hospital) -Recurrent DVT/PE, on lovenox, has IVC filter--history of DVT on coumadin Cardiac Risk Factors: Dyslipidemia   Social History: Retired custodian.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Supple with no appreciable JVD.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
lung fields CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pleural thickening and scarring is present in the apex of the post resection right upper lung.
Opacification in the infrahilar right lower lung could be scarring but acute infection cannot be excluded.
There is no good evidence for pneumonia in the left lung.
Pleural calcification or linear atelectasis is present at the right base, there also appears to be a small amount of fibrosis, but no appreciable pleural effusion is present nor is there evidence of pneumothorax .
Recent data: [**5-20**] C Cath LMCA--no sign disease LAD--Diffuse calcific disease, serial 50% lesion and mid vessel 80% lesion LCX--TO distally with LPDA filling via RCA collaterals.
Mid vessel 80% lesion proximal vessel 60% lesion RCA--Diffuse disease with serial 60% lesions (small vessel) PCI--Overlapping stents in distal OM with normal flow, mild thrombus, and no residual stenosis, absent collateral flow .
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with focal basal free wall hypokinesis.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with basal hypokinesis and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension suggestive of primary pulmonary process (pulmonary embolism, COPD, etc.)
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 yo man recently discharged after stents placed in the OM1 and D1 who presented with new onset Afib with RVR in setting of CP and SOB.
# Chest/back pain: His presentation was atypical and longstanding.
He has a history of GERD as well as spinal stenosis and atypical back pain.
We also increased his gabapentin to treat for neuropathic pain.
Initially he required IV dilaudid for pain relief but with these measures and intermittent oxycodone/APAP he had good control of pain.
Thereafter, he only reported subjective complaints of SOB intermittently.
We treated with MDIs based on exam findings of wheezing and history of smoking.
# Cards rhythm: pt received dilt gtt and amio gtt at OSH then spontaneously converted to sinus prior to arrival in the CCU.
We did not suspect PE as the source of his afib as he had been properly anticoagulated and this would not have changed our management.
# Cards ischemic: no evidence of acute ischemia on these EKGs.
We cycled his enzymes and he did have a troponin leak (neg CKs) which ruled him in for an NSTEMI.
We believe this was demand ischemia from his AFib with RVR and he was not having active ischemia once this was corrected.
His intermittent episodes of chest pain during his hospitalization were not felt to be cardiac ischemia.
# Cards pump: recent echo with no evidence of failure.
No evidence of failure on exam.
# CP/Back pain: atypical and longstanding.
# C Diff: Patient had complaints of epigastric pain and loose stools.
He had no episodes of melena or BRBPR.
# FC discussed on admit .
He has intermittent episodes of chest pain but serial EKGs did not suggest ischemia.
His pain is improved with percocet and/or gabapentin.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for pain or temp>101.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor First Name 391**] Bay - [**Hospital1 392**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - chest pain NOS: noncardiac.
thought to be GERD, MSK, or neuropathic - neuropathic back pain - c diff colitis - COPD Secondary: - CAD s/p recent stents to the OM1 and D1 - Anemia, baseline hct 28-32 - s/p back surgery - lupus anticoag - hx recurrent DVT/PE on lovenox - dyslipidemia Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Pain well managed.
Discharge Instructions: You came in with shortness of breath, chest pain, and a rapid heart rate.
Your heart rate improved and your symptoms improved.
Your chest pain was evaluated and determined to be NONCARDIAC in origin.
It is likely reflux disease, musculoskeletal disease, or neuropathic pain.
We continued your medications as previously prescribed except for the following adjustments: 1.  increased your neurontin to 600, 600, 900 2.  started flagyl 500mg TID for c diff colitis x14 total days 3.
Please return to the hospital if you develop chest pain or shortness of breath or any other concerning symptoms.
