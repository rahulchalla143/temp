No major vascular territorial infarct is apparent.
A large mucus- retention cyst is seen within the right maxillary sinus as well as a smaller one within the left, with adjacent mucosal thickening.
Air-fluid levels are present within the sphenoid sinus as well as mucosal thickening within the ethmoid sinus, which given presence of dependent fluid within the nasopharynx, is likely related to intubation.
No osseous abnormalities are identified.
