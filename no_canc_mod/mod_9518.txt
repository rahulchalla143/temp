Briefly, the patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU and had an EGD that revealed a large ulcer just above GE junction in the esophagus, he had a vessel cauterized.
His syncope was thought to be due to his GIB, but he was ruled out for MI.

Brief Hospital Course: This is an 80 yoM with h/o CAD presenting with hematemesis and syncope, found to have a bleeding esophageal ulcer which required cauterization.
1) Upper GI Bleed: Patient was admitted on aspirin and plavix, and per EGD found to have an ulcer that had a vessel which was cauterized.
Per GI, he should have his ASA and plavix held for life, but with his history of CAD restarting ASA 81mg can be considered at 1 week post discharge, and restarting plavix not only for status post CABG but for carotid stenosis, can be decided by his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
2) Syncope: The patient's syncope on admission was attributed to hypovolemia, secondary to his upper GI bleed.
Other work-up was pursued, and he did not exhibit signs of arrythmia on telemetry, was ruled out for an MI, and his ECHO lacked significant valvular pathology.
The patient has known carotid stenosis, that should be further addressed as an outpatient.
On discharge, the patient was stable and without symptoms of pre-syncope.
He had no symptoms during his course and was continued on atorvastatin, and labetolol.
Upper GI bleed, secondary to an esophageal ulcer.
Anemia 3.
Hypertension   Discharge Condition: stable, tolerating medications, ambulating   Discharge Instructions: 1.
Please return to the hospital for vomiting, unable to take medications, uncontrolled fevers, black tarry stools or bright red blood per rectum or breathing difficulties.
You had stool that was guaiac positive, while this may be secondary to your upper GI bleed, you should discuss with your doctor the need for a colonoscopy.
We held your aspirin and plavix, discuss with your doctor or cardiologist the need to restart this given your significant risk of bleeding.
