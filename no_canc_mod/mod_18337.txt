Admission Date:  [**2129-7-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-8-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-1-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Haldol / Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from [**Hospital1 **] for persistent fevers   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**8-12**] AVR (#21 Biocor)   History of Present Illness: 79 yo male with very complicated pmhx including critical AS s/p valvuloplasty, IDDM, PAF, MRSA pneumonia and c-diff, recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2129-7-1**] after being admitted for hypotension, and fevers, thought to be secondary to pseudomnal pneumonia.
Sputum culture returned with evidence of pseudomonas, resistant to Ciprofloxacin, and MRSA.
Given that the patient has had intermittent fevers since admission to [**Hospital1 **] and has poor progress in weaning from the ventilator, the patient's family requested transfer back to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient denies pain or difficulty breathing, able to follow minimal commands.
Past Medical History: (obtained from prior dc summary as pt unable to provide) 1. s/p MVC with multiple traumas in [**2-2**] with prolonged 4 month hospital stay at [**University/College **], with trach placed [**2129-5-25**] after several intubations for hypercarbic respiratory failure 2.
CAD- left heart cath done at [**University/College **] revealed non-obstructive CAD, severe AS, mod pulm htn, nml EF (60%) 3.chronically depressed mental status critical 4.
A fib 4. chronic b/l pleural effusions 5. anemia 6.
Diabetes 9. chronic, severe generalized myopathy with mild membrane instability, and evidence for a moderate peroneal neuropathy at the right fibular neck seen on EMG on [**5-/2129**]   Social History: Non-smoker.
Has several children.
Right PICC site appears clean NEURO: awake, able to follow commands including open his eyes, move his tongue, does not move extremities on command or spontaneously, diminished reflexes B/L   Pertinent Results: Labs from rehab: sputum [**7-5**]: pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime, ceftaz, gent, imipenem, zosyn sputum [**7-1**]: pseudomonas and MRSA- MRSA sensitive to Bactrim urine culture [**7-5**]: no growth blood culture [**7-5**]: 1/4 bottles CNS ABG [**7-9**]: 7.49/51/89/39 INR- 1.4 CBC [**7-8**]: .
prior studies- Echo [**2129-6-27**]: IMPRESSION: Moderate aortic valve stenosis.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity sizes and regional/global biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
EEG [**7-5**]: IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the generalized bursts of slowing, including very sharp features and sharp waves in the central regions bilaterally.
These finding suggest a midline disturbance but are not specific with regard to etiology.
The sharp features are  evidence of cortical hypersynchrony and could be related to an epileptic process but also to a metabolic disturbance.
There were no prominent focal areas of slowing.
No evidence of an acute infarction.
Small chronic lacunar infarction in the body of the right caudate nucleus.
Mucosal thickening and air/fluid level of the right maxillary sinus consistent with acute sinusitis.
No arterial occlusion or evidence of stenosis in the circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
**FINAL REPORT [**2129-7-12**]**    FECAL CULTURE (Final [**2129-7-12**]):       NO ENTERIC GRAM NEGATIVE RODS FOUND.
NO SALMONELLA OR SHIGELLA FOUND.
CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Final [**2129-7-12**]):    NO CAMPYLOBACTER FOUND.
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2129-7-11**]):       FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
ECG Study Date of [**2129-7-10**]  2:28:04 AM Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response.
Underlying intraventricular conduction delay.
Compared to tracing of [**2129-6-27**] no definite change.
IMAGING [**2129-7-9**] PORTABLE CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-13**] through [**6-29**]: Severe consolidation in the right lung has worsened since [**6-27**].
Milder interstitial abnormality in the left lung probably represents residual edema or scarring.
Moderate cardiomegaly unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
The diffuse pulmonary process, more severe in right lung, has not significantly changed since the previous exam but overall is gradually worsening since [**6-29**].
The bilateral pulmonary edema is of unchanged stability.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are again noted, although cannot be precisely appreciated due to the fact that the most lateral costophrenic angles were not included in the field of view.
IMPRESSION: Probable, overall slight worsening of pulmonary edema and right lower lobe consolidation.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal  technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is severe aortic valve  stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial  mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Dense calcification of the aortic valve.
A component of chronic interstitial lung disease may be present .
H/O cardiac surgery.
Left ventricular function.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA  PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views.
Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.
Conclusions: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Preoperatively, Balancing blood pressure with volume overload was challenging, as diuresis limited by hypotension.
Hypotension improved with decreased PEEP.
It was felt that his volume overload and hypotension were most likely secondary to his atrial fibrillation and severe aortic stenosis.
Cardiac surgery was consulted who felt that valve replacement had only approximately a 30% chance of success but agreed to perform the procedure.
Prior to surgery he was placed on a lasix drip to attempt to remove some volume with modest success.
Patient with slow GI bleed throughout this hospitalization with black tarry stool.
He had evidence of gastritis and duodenotis on EGD on [**7-18**] without evidence of active bleeding.
He had multiple blood transfusions.
He underwent colonoscopy on [**7-27**] which showed evidence of diverticulosis but no evidence of active bleeding.
His trach was changed 3x secondary to persistent leak, tracheomalacia extending to both mainstem bronc's noted, currently with 8.0 [**Last Name (un) **].
He had evidence of a resistant pseudomonal VAP sensitive to imipenim and cefepime from culture results from [**Hospital1 **] and [**Hospital1 18**].
Also treated MRSA given sensitivities of sputum culture from OSH (Was on bactrim [**2039-7-9**], vanc [**2044-7-14**]).
Aggressive diuresis continued.
Post operatively the patient was seen by the GI service as he had intermittant guiac positive stool but no melana or [**Month/Year (2) **] bleeding, he was transfused w/PRBC's and PPI was changed to [**Hospital1 **] dosing.
He was scoped from above and below just before surgery, at that time he was found to have diverticulosis and mild gastritis.
