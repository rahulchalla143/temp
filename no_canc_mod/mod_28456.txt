On admission, she had a carotid U/S performed which confirmed the findings of carotid stenosis.
She also underwent an MRI/A of the brain which revealed severe stenosis, but no evidence of stroke.
She denies any dizziness or presyncope.
She had one episode of syncope in [**6-8**] which was attributed to hypoglycemia.
She notes bilateral vision changes which she describes as a "film" coming down over her eyes.
Of note, she had a left eye hemorrhage in [**2196**] which has since resolved.
She denies any chest pain, pressure or palpitations.

Past Medical History: # HTN # Hyperlipidemia # DM - on insulin # CAD - w/ 3VD (LMCA 205 stenosis, LAD occluded after D1, LCx patent, OM1 70-80% stenosis) - s/p DES to mid LAD and proximal OM lesions [**2196-1-11**] - originally attempted POBA of LAD in [**12-6**] # PAD - laser atherectomy and balloon angioplasty of L SFA [**2197-7-26**] - stenting of proximal and mid/distal L SFA lesions [**2196-10-7**] - stent of R SFA lesion [**2196-9-9**] - PTA of L SFA [**2196-8-24**] - *unsuccessful* PTA of L SFA (was totally occluded) - PTA of R SFA [**2196-2-19**] # GERD # Colon cancer s/p right hemicolectomy # Bilateral carotid stenosis # s/p CCY # Left eye hemmorhage in [**5-7**], now resolved   Social History: Widowed.
Family History: Mother had an MI and died at 60 years old.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
+ carotid bruit on right.
No HSM or tenderness.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Severe stenoses of the internal carotid artery bulbs bilaterally.
Severe stenosis of the proximal left common carotid artery and subclavian artery, and possible stenosis of the proximal right common carotid artery.
Moderate stenosis of the proximal vertebral arteries bilaterally.
Moderate chronic microangiopathic changes with no acute infarcts.
Angiography of the aortic arch revealed 40% origin left carotid stenosis.
The right carotid was cannulated and found to have a 90% stenosis at the origin of the [**Country **].
Patient had a vagal episode with sheath insertion requiring 1mg of atropine.
Bilateral carotid artery stenosis by MRA and dupplex ultrasound.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
A high-attenuation right renal cortical lesion may represent a hyperdense cyst.
CXR: IMPRESSION: Slight cardiomegaly without signs of cardiac congestion or decompensation.
No pleural effusion.
No signs of pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: # CAROTID STENOSIS: Patient has known bilateral carotid stenosis based on MRI/MRA from [**2195**].
Pt went for R carotid stent on [**12-12**].
Also was hypotensive and bradycardic while in the ICU.
Bradycardia and hypotension eventually improved.
Patient then went for L carotid stenting s/p two stents on [**12-15**] with transient hypotension requiring dopamine drip.
Was weaned off the dopamine with no complications.
# CARDIAC: 1) CAD: Pt is s/p drug eluting stent to LAD and OM.
No evidence of CHF on exam.
No evidence of CHF on exam.
3) RHYTHM: Sinus bradycardia at baseline, though additional decreased heart rate in the setting of her R carotid stent placement.
She received one dose of atropine on the floor for bradycardia, and an additional dose after her L carotid stenting.
As per EP, no need for pacemaker as bradycardia is likely reflex secondary to angiography and stenting of carotid artery.
Atenolol was held during admission for sinus bradycardia, but it can be restarted as an outpatient.
She did receive peripheral dopamine on the left, however, no evidence of skin discoloration or signs of necrosis or other injury.
# Vulvovaginal candidiasis: Pt complained of vaginal itching on her final day of admission.
