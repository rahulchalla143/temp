Hyperlipidemia 3.
Family History: Diabetes  Physical Exam: GEN- WDWN gentleman sitting in chair, sleepy but easily aroused, in hard collar, not in acute distress HEENT- ecchymosis accross bridge of nose, PERRL, EOMI, OP clear, mmm, in hard collar CV- RRR no murmur/rubs/gallops LUNGS- crackles R side at base otherwise clear, no wheeze ABD- soft, obese, nontender, large nontender ecchymosis on left flank, +BS, no rebound/guarding EXTR- 2+ edema LE NEURO- awake oriented to only person and city/state/"hospital", year [**2108**] at [**Hospital 756**] Hospital, CN 2-12 intact, patient slightly sedated will preform complete neuro exam when clearer.
Flex/extension views are recommended for further evaluation, if there are symptoms referable to this region.
Degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
Left-sided chronic subdural hematoma.
Left bundle-branch block with ST-T wave abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
C-SPINE FLEX/EX- Degenerative changes of the lower cervical spine without signs for ligamentous laxity on flexion or extension views of the upper cervical spine.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave abnormalities.
Since the previous tracing of [**2178-4-29**] no significant change.
Cervical MRI: No evidence of ligamentous disruption seen.
No evidence of abnormal signal seen within the vertebral bodies to indicate acute trauma.
Multilevel degenerative changes with foraminal changes as above.
No evidence of extrinsic spinal cord compression or intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities.
KUB: Stable appearance to the dilated loops of small and large bowel as compared to one day prior.
Abd US: There is no fluid collection within the subcutaneous tissues of the right hemi-abdomen, flank, or right back.
No fluid is seen within the peritoneal cavity along the right side.
Brief Hospital Course: Breifly, 70M with hyperlipidemia and diabetes [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital **] Hosp where he presented in DKA/hyperglycemia and a new right subdural hematoma.
Negative infectious w/u thought to be associated with SDH/R flank hematoma or dilantin.
Known RLL pneumonia treated 5 days with ceftriaxone/azithro and 6days IV flagyl w/resolution on CXR.
OSH abd CT [**4-29**] negative for abscess.
Abd US no ductal dilatation or abscess.
Ileus- serial KUB with adynamic ileus.
No nausea/vomitting, +gas, has had chronic decreased appetite, no abdominal tenderness.
Right lower lobe pneumonia- as above .
Unclear cause of hyperglycemia possibly poor med compliance versus infection given leukocytosis upon presentation at OSH.
Delta MS/Balance difficulties/multiple falls- Initial difficulty with balance and multiple falls most likely [**1-22**] DKA/dehydration given acute nature of symptoms, however RLL pneumonia also contributing factor.
New R subdural hematoma- per neurosurg, loaded dilantin and no surgical intervention at this time.
Possible cervical fx- CT c-spine with anterolisthesis but Flex/ex views without ligamentous injury.
Per ortho, initially thought possible fx of cervical spinous process recommend MRI to eval for supraspinal ligament or disc injury.
Soft collar PRN for neck discomfort or tension headaches.
# EKG changes.
QTc sl prolonged [**1-22**] severe hypocalcemia unclear etiology.
Decr'd Phos AND Ca- possible vit D deficiency unclear etiology.
Hyponatremia possibly [**1-22**] SIADH from SDH consider free water restriction.
Also, mild nongap acidosis unclear etiology consider checking urine anion gap to r/o RTA.
# PPx.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every eight (8) hours as needed for pain: hold for sedation or rr<12.
PO once a day as needed for constipation for 1 doses.
