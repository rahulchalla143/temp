No angina, no shortness of breath.
Echocardiogram in [**2110-7-8**] showed bilateral atrial enlargement, EF greater than 70, trace aortic insufficiency, 4 plus MR with partial mitral leaflet flailed, 2 plus TR, severe pulmonary hypertension.
An exercise tolerance test in [**2110-8-7**] was stopped secondary to fatigue with no angina, no ischemic EKG changes.
Catheterization on admission, [**2110-9-16**] showed 50 percent discrete intermedius, moderate pulmonary hypertension, moderate early elevated left-sided filling pressures.
General:  Lying flat in bed in no acute distress.
GI:  Abdomen is soft, round, nontender, and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
No varicosities, positive edema right ankle secondary to past surgery.
Pulmonary vascular and upper lung zones are slightly increased, patchy atelectasis in the bilateral lung bases, otherwise lungs are clear with no acute cardiopulmonary process.
Chronic renal insufficiency with polycystic kidney disease with a creatinine level of 1.9 to 2.1 baseline.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Left ankle fracture.
Congestive heart failure.
ALLERGIES:  Cipro causing dizziness and syncope.
Vitamin E.   SU[**Last Name (STitle) 42242**]OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Post cardiac catheterization on [**2110-9-16**], the patient was referred for a mitral valve replacement.
He was extubated on postoperative day one with no significant events, and was A-paced in the 60s with an underlying sinus bradycardia in the 50s.
On postoperative day two, the patient experienced some breakthrough atrial fibrillation above his paced rate and an EP consult was gotten.
On [**9-27**], postoperative day five, the patient experienced several episodes of atrial fibrillation with a repeat EP consult, which recommended beta blockers for rate control and again Coumadin therapy for at least six weeks.
Following atenolol doses on postoperative day six, heart rate dropped to the 30s and 40s with no symptoms and blood pressures stable 110s/50s, and atenolol was D/C'd.
It was felt that no intervention was needed since the patient was stable and he will follow up with EP as an outpatient.
Patient also had symptoms of urinary retention throughout his hospital stay, which has [**Last Name 19301**] problem for him in the past as he does have benign prostatic hypertrophy status post TURP x2.
The patient was followed by Physical Therapy throughout his hospital stay for evaluation and treatment.
He experienced some trouble with his gait having a shuffling gait with decreased stride length, decreased heel strike bilaterally, question of some footdrop.
Abdomen is soft, round, nontender, and nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No edema.
No signs and symptoms of infection.
Postoperative urinary retention.
Postoperative atrial fibrillation.
Polycystic kidney disease.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy status post transurethral resection of the prostate.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
