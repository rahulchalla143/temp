Admission Date:  [**2128-7-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-7-9**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Erythromycin Base  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**] Chief Complaint: expressive aphasia and right sided weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Implantation of Carotid Arterial Stent Thrombin injection of right femoral pseudoaneursym   History of Present Illness: 88-yo-woman w/ CAD (S/P 3 vessle CABG [**41**] years ago) and left ICA stenosis is now transferred to the CCU for post-procedure monitoring after left ICA stenting.
She was initially admitted to the Neurology service on [**7-5**] after awaking from a nap w/ new expressive aphasia and right sided weakness.
Urgent CTA of the head showed no intracranial hemorrhage and possible hyperdense left MCA sign at an outside hospital.
Cardiac ischemica was ruled out w/ serial biomarkers.
By the morning after admission, her symptoms had resolved entirely.
[**2128-7-7**] she was treated w/ left ICA stent, with no complications.
She is now transferred to the CCU service for post-procedure monitoring.
She reports that her voice is almost back to normal and that she has some residual right arm pain that she attributes to the pressure cuff.
Vomited x1 on [**2128-7-6**] - no blood.
Past Medical History: - CAD s/p CABG: known LBBB - left ICA stenosis(60-70% in [**7-/2127**]) - HTN - hyperlipidemia - hypothyroidism - macular degeneration - OA - Osteoporosis - Anxiety   Social History: significant for the absence of tobacco use.
There is history of moderate alcohol abuse.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
RR 2/6 systolic murmur at apex to axilla.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
Patient has a femoral bruit on the right and not on the left.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses: Right: Carotid deferred Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+ Left: Carotid deferred Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+   Pertinent Results: EKG demonstrated sinus brady at 59 bpm; LBBB; no ischemic changes; no change from prior dated [**2127-8-20**].
There is a large calcified plaque at the origin of the right internal carotid artery and carotid bulb causing approximately 60% stenosis.
A similar circumferential calcified plaque is seen at the origin of the left internal carotid artery and carotid bulb causing approximately 63% diameter stenosis.
Bilateral external carotid artery stenosis is also seen.
There is a calcific plaque at the origin of the left vertebral artery, which is not hemodynamically significant.
Intracranially, there is mild irregularity of the basilar artery, without hemodynamically significant stenosis.
There is bilateral cavernous carotid calcification.
No significant stenosis is seen.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral ICA stenosis at the origin ranging from 60% to 65% Small right supraclinoid ICA aneurysm pointing posteriorly, which appears to be separate from the posterior communicating artery origin.
[**7-6**] MRI head: Multiple bilateral deep cerebral and periventricular white matter chronic small vessel ischemic changes, with small punctate areas displaying restricted diffusion, likely representing subacute multiple vascular territorial infarcts.
[**7-6**] ECHO: No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**7-8**] femoral u/s:  3 cm pseudoaneurysm in right inguinal region at site of prior vascular intervention.
No evidence of AV fistula formation.
[**7-9**] u/s: complete thrombosis of pseudoaneurysm.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 88 year old female with remote hx of CABG and carotid artery stenosis who presents with right sided weakness and expressive aphasia.
She has bilateral ICA stenosis but given her symptoms consistent with left sided cerebral hypoperfusion, she was treated with stent placement to the left ICA.
She tolerated this well and had resolution of her neuro sx.
#)Femoral pseudoaneurysm: she had a pseudoaneursym as a complication of the stent placement.
It was detected promptly and ultrasound showed aneurysm as above.
She required one unit transfusion given rapid hct drop (nadir 25).
#) Anemia - normocytic anemia with normal RDW.
She did have an OB positive stool but it was brown and not consistent with melena.
This was not thought to be her primary source of the hct drop.
If she has melena or her hct drops in followup, this must be considered and she would benefit from an outpatient GI workup.
-Rhythm: tele -Ischemia: Ruled out for MI with three serial enzymes.
required tylenol #3 for pain control.
-on Doxycycline 100 [**Hospital1 **] for the last month after having osteonecrosis of the Jaw from fosamax.
continued -There was no sign of infection on exam.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: -Symptomatic Carotid Stenosis now s/p stent placement -femoral artery pseudoaneurysm s/p thrombin injection -anemia likely secondary to mild blood loss at groin site, IVF; controlled -CAD -HTN -hyperlipidemia Secondary -hypothyroidism -macular degeneratoin -OA -osteoporosis -anxiety   Discharge Condition: well   Discharge Instructions: You came in with difficulty speaking and right sided weakness.
You had a pseudoaneurysm of your right femoral artery and were treated with a thrombin injection.
You may benefit from an outpatient GI workup.
