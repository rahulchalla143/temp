Admission Date:  [**2101-4-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2101-4-22**]   Service:  MICU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 78-year-old woman with a history of multiple psychiatric admissions for bipolar disorder as well as hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diverticulosis, Barrett's esophagus who was recently on ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection for the past three days and was found on the floor by her husband covered in brown feces and vomit.
She was noted to then be vomiting dark brown material.
She reported abdominal pain that was right-sided, crampy and nonradiating on the night prior to admission also associated with vomiting and diarrhea.
She vomited a small amount of coffee ground material times two.
CT of the abdomen was performed which demonstrated diffuse colonic thickening.
Surgery was consulted who considered ischemic versus infectious colitis.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on two liters nasal cannula home oxygen.
Bipolar disorder.
Multiple psychiatric admissions for bipolar disorder, most recent [**3-1**] to [**2101-3-31**].
Urinary tract infections.
Constipation and abdominal pain of long-standing duration.
Declining to lie flat for an examination but otherwise in no acute distress.
No scleral icterus.
Grade [**2-10**] holosystolic murmur at the right upper sternal border without radiation.
No crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
Abdomen: Protuberant, distended, no obvious surgical scars.
Soft, diffusely tender, no rebound or guarding.
Skin warm, dry, no rashes.
RADIOLOGY:  KUB without volvulus or intestinal obstruction.
Probable distended bladder.
Chest x-ray:  No free air.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, intervals, no ectopy.
Left atrial enlargement, no Q-waves.
One millimeter ST depression in 2, 3 and F.  Positive left ventricular hypertrophy.
She continued to note abdominal pain with diarrhea initially.
It was unclear whether or not the patient had infectious colitis versus ischemic colitis with super infection from transmutation of flora.
No source of upper GI bleeding was noted.
It is possible that this could have been from her lower GI sources.
On the day after admission the patient was noted to be atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Given the patient's reported history to beta blockers and calcium channel blockers, Electrophysiology was consulted, especially with the concern of AV nodal disease.
The patient fluctuated between atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm with a well controlled rate.
The patient was transferred to the floor for additional workup of her GI issues.
On the night she was sent to the floor the patient again had atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response with a heart rate in the 150's to 170's with a blood pressure in the 70's systolic.
with good control of her ventricular response.
She went back and forth between atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm.
Decision was made not to anticoagulate given her gastrointestinal issues and recent GI bleed.
verapamil that additional nodal blockade with amiodarone or other agents may be necessary and might require a pacemaker.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  This patient was maintained on her albuterol, Atrovent and Flovent inhalers.
She did not experience any COPD exacerbations.
Hypertension:  The patient has likely poorly controlled hypertension as an outpatient.
She did not have any adverse reactions to this medication.
She was maintained on low dose to keep her blood pressure systolic greater than 120 give a question of ischemic colitis.
Atrial fibrillation complicated by rapid ventricular response and hypotension.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home oxygen.
Bipolar disorder.
held due to lower GI bleed.
