No adventitious movements.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior septum and akinesis of the inferior free wall and posterior wall.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.

There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Just over 60% stenosis of the proximal left common carotid artery.
Moderate atherosclerotic disease at the carotid bifurcations bilaterally, with likely an ulcerated plaque involving the proximal right external carotid artery and extensive soft plaque within the carotid bulb on the right.
8 mm nodular soft tissue density within the left paraglottic fat may be a lymph node but is of unclear etiology and should be correlated with clinical findings and/or direct visualization.

Extensive degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
Severe atrophy and evidence of old cortical embolic infarcts.
Extensive chronic microvascular ischemic change.
Evolving acute and virtual-complete right middle cerebral artery territory infarction with hemorrhagic transformation and extension of the hemorrhage into the right lateral and third ventricles, layering in bilateral occipital horns.
Significant leftward shift of midline structures, with marked subfalcine herniation and less marked uncal herniation.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 80yo RHM with Afib not on Coumadin but possibly ASA, HTN, DM and hx of stroke with some residual L sided weakness who smokes >1PPD found per VNA at home down on the floor with slurred speech and L sided weakness around 3pm.
His initial NIHSS score was 19 for R gaze deviation, L sided weakness and sensory deficit.
His CT of head shows dense R MCA with likely M2 level occlusion and loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter differentiation over the distribution.
He was initially started on a heparin drip but follow up CT scan showed a large size of infarct and it was determined that the risk of bleeding outweighed the benefits of heparin.
On [**11-27**] the patient was less esponsive to commands and was tachypneic,  a CXR showed a worsening infiltrate in the right lower lobe.
Later in the afternoon the patient was found to have an fixed and dilated right pupil.
A head CT was obtained showing a large hemorrhagic coversion.
You were found to have a large stroke on the right side of your brain.
This was likley a blood clot from your heart as a result of your irregular heart beat and not taking a blood thinning [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
