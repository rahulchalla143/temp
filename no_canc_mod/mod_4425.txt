Mylanta was [**Last Name (un) 28405**] without relief and pt vomited clear sputum.
During her recent hospitalization on [**9-25**] she became agitated, hypertensive and bradycardic.
During that time she had a troponin elevation to a max of 0.31 and was evaluated by cardiology.
This was felt to be related to demmand and it was advised to perform a TTE and possible f/u stress vs cath.
CXR showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema with resolved pleural effusion compared to prior (IM HO read).
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of current chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
She denies dysuria and states that she is on the antibiotics for her leg only.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - Diastolic Dysfunction - Atrial Fibrillation not on warfarin given recent admission for epistaxis ([**8-/2195**]) taking ASA 325mg 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Acute Renal Failure [**8-/2195**] (baseline Cr 1.0 -> 4.7), discharged with Cr 2.5 - Cataract Surgery  Social History: Pt moved to [**Location (un) 86**] from [**Country 2045**] 40 yrs ago, currently lives with daughter who works at the [**Hospital1 **].
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: Resp were unlabored, no wheezes.
ABDOMEN: Soft, distended but no TTP.
No HSM or tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: 2+ pitting LE edema with skin dryness/breakdown.
LABS/STUDIES EKG: afib rate 65, LAD, TWI I, avL similar to prior and mild increase in inversion/flattening in V5, C6 .
TTE [**2195-9-26**] Moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function.
Mild right ventricular dilation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Elevated estimated PCWP.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-3-15**], the right ventricle now appears mildly dilated.
Aortic valve stenosis has slightly progressed (but is still mild).
Within this constraint, there is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or vascular territorial infarction.
There is no fracture.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 72 year old female with a history of DM type 2,  dCHF, HL, HTN, and atrial fibrillation with a complicated hospital course during this admission.
She was previously admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2195-9-22**] through [**2195-10-8**] for management of LLE venous ulcers.
During that admission had multiple triggers for hypertensive urgency, A-fib with RVR, Dyspnea.
Non invasive LE vascular studies demonstrated venous and arterial disease not amenable to percutaneous intervention.
She then became febrile and was taken to OR for left BKA [**2195-10-10**] as source was presumed to be distal LLE infected ulcer.
On [**10-15**] she became somnulent and difficult to arouse and was transferred to the medicine service for further management.
A CT was obtained which ruled out an acute intracranial process.
Her AMS change was attributed to medication effect including prazocin, Clonidin, Morphine and oxycodone in the context of reduced renal clearance due to acute on chronic renal failure.
Her renal failure was treated with administration of IVF and PRBC and her renal functions improved.
Her fever subsequently resolved, Bcx remained negative and operative tissue histology demonstrated clean margines without signs of infection.
The following is a brief re-cap of her problems during this admission: .
Chest pain resolved soon after admission and did not recurr.
# LLE nonhealing infected ulcer: This was secondary to PVD.
# AMS change : [**1-6**] to drowsing medication including oxycodone, morphine, prazocin and clonidin in the context of reduced renal clearance.
# Renal Failure: pre-renal failure [**1-6**] to over-diuresis.
# Fever: Had fever which did not initially resolve after BKA for a non healing LLE infected ulcer.
Fever subsequently resolved and wide-spectrum antibiotics were discontinued [**10-20**] after she remained afebrile for > 72 hours.
# Anemia: Stable Hct at 25 microcytic with increased RDW consistnet with iron def.
No obvious bleeding source.
Got 1X PRBC d/t backround heart disease as well as for volume expansion in the context of dehydration.
Furhter f/u of Hct and anemia work-up is advised in the outpatient setting.
# HTN: Has history of uncontrolled HTN and hypertensive urgencies.
Underwent work-up for secondary HTN during previous admission which was unrevealing except for elevated urine metanephrines at about twice normal level.
She did not however have any other symptoms or signs suggestive of pheochromocytoma.
# CAF: This was stable with no RVR during this admission.
Patient continues to decline coumadin given her history of epistaxis.
# dCHF: had dCHF exacerbation during her previous admission which was treated with duresis.
During this admission was stable in terms of her heart failure.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were initially admitted to the hospital because of chest pain.
You had tests that confirmed that you did not have a heart attack.
You then developed a fever which was likely due to an infection of your left lower leg ulcer.
You underwent amputation of your left lower leg as this was the only way to prevent the infection from spreading and becoming life threatening.
After the operation you had some trouble including anemia, dehydration which injured your kidneys and some drowsiness due to medications you recieved to treat your pain and high blood pressures.
You were given fluids and blood transfusion as well as antibiotics for a likely infection and your medication regimen was adjusted.
