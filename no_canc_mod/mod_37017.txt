Admission Date:  [**2105-12-30**]       Discharge Date:  [**2106-1-5**]   Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, who presents for elective catheterization in the setting of worsening shortness of breath.
The patient had an exercise tolerance test in [**2105-9-17**], which was positive for inferior and inferolateral reversible defects.
He was recently admitted from [**11-25**] to [**11-29**] with congestive heart failure.
Echocardiogram at that time showed an ejection fraction of 30% with focal left ventricular hypokinesis and posterolateral akinesis and 1+ MR.  Over the past several weeks, the patient has had increasing dyspnea on exertion.
He also notes increasing lower extremity edema bilaterally.
History is also notable for chronic renal insufficiency and, thus, he will require close observation and optimization prior to catheterization.
Congestive heart failure, as outlined above.
Atrial fibrillation, status post pacer placement in [**2103**].
Embolic CVA, no residual deficits.
Chronic lymphedema.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Degenerative joint disease.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
There is no thyromegaly.
There are 2+ carotids with no bruits.
LUNGS:  Crackles at the bases bilaterally.
HEART:  Heart is regular in rate and rhythm, with no rubs, murmurs, or gallops.
EXTREMITIES:  Extremities have 3+ edema to the thighs bilaterally and stasis changes and skin breakdown in the leg bilaterally.
Chest x-ray:  ([**2104-12-10**]):  Increased pleural effusions bilaterally.
No acute ST or T changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 81-year-old man with diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, who presents with progressive dyspnea on exertion.
He does not have any additional signs or symptoms of coronary artery disease.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction.
He underwent coronary artery catheterization on [**1-4**], which showed no significant coronary disease.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient was initially diuresed as it was felt that he was in significant congestive heart failure.
He was briefly transferred to the Coronary Care Unit, where a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed which showed normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, but elevated right sided pressures.
The patient was taken off an Ace inhibitor and placed on Hydralazine for afterload reduction secondary to his chronic renal insufficiency.
At cardiac catheterization on [**1-4**], the patient was found to have elevated left and right side filling pressures, as well as pulmonary artery hypertension (pulmonary artery pressure 59/21; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 21).
These elevated filling pressures explained the patient's left heart and right heart failure symptoms.
The patient will need further evaluation, especially of pulmonary disease to explain his right heart failure.
The patient would benefit from a chest CT as an outpatient and perhaps a VQ scan to evaluate for pulmonary embolism.
In the meantime, the patient is continued on Hydralazine and nitrates for afterload reduction, as well as Lasix 80 mg p.o.b.i.d.
for gentle diuresis.
He was found to have a urinary tract infection and Levofloxacin renally dosed was begun for a five-day course.
CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY:  The patient has a baseline creatinine of 1.7, creatinine is now stable at 2.2 to 2.5.
Following the catheterization, the patient was placed on Hydralazine and nitrates for afterload reduction.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient has a history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus type 2.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient had a hematocrit drop following the catheterization and he was transfused three units of packed red blood cells.
There was no evidence of bleeding.
There was no evidence of hemolysis.
The patient also had a drop in his platelet count to a level of 90 while on heparin in the Intensive Care Unit.
Congestive heart failure.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
