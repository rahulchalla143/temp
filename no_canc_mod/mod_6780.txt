Prior to admission he had recently been on a long trip to [**Country 651**] and [**Country 33101**] and was seen in the liver clinic on [**2161-5-26**] and found to have elevated liver enzymes with an AST to 2,620 and ALT to 3,742 with a total bilirubin of 11.8 and coagulopathy with an INR of 2.1.
He presented to [**Hospital1 346**] for management of liver failure in the setting of what was probably an acute hepatitis B flare.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, occasional alcohol.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  His review of systems was significant for fatigue and nonproductive cough x 10 days, dark urine, moderate amount of diarrhea, increased abdominal distention, acholic stools.
Head/Neck:  Icteric sclerae, intact extraocular movements, clear oropharynx, moist mucous membranes, supple neck and 1 cm bilateral submandibular nodes.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, obese, nondistended with bowel sounds.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities: Without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
There was no free abdominal fluid.
Chest x-ray on admission demonstrated no pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the [**Hospital1 139**] medicine firm for management of his hepatitis as well as coagulopathy management.
At this point he began to demonstrate increasing confusion, disorientation and other signs and symptoms consistent with encephalopathy.
For this he was transferred to the medical intensive care unit and thought to be a grade II encephalopathy at that point.
Upon discussions with the patient's family and the patient it was decided to intubate the patient secondary to aspiration risk electively on [**2161-6-3**].
In the medical intensive care unit the patient was observed closely for neurologic deterioration and he was placed on the transplant list and given approximately an 80% mortality with his encephalopathic picture and hepatic failure.
His hepatic enzymes remained elevated though slightly decreased from admission throughout the initial part of his hospital course.
Initially CMV PCR was sent and VRE and MRSA screens were sent.
On [**2161-6-11**] the patient was again recultured for a temperature spike.
From a neurologic standpoint the patient demonstrated progressive encephalopathy.
On [**2161-6-12**] again the patient had a head CT post bullet placement which demonstrated no signs of intracranial bleed.
At this point the neurology service was consulted for evaluation of her irreversible neurologic deficit.
The patient became a high priority transplant candidate.
They felt that while he had had progressive encephalopathy there was no evidence of irreversible neurologic deficit.
