Hospital Course: # Pancytopenia: On admission the etiology of the patient's pancytopenia was unlcear.
The initial differential diagnosis included myelodysplastic syndrome vs. myelosupression from viral syndrome or toxin vs. hemophagocytic syndrome.
The [**Hospital1 18**] pathology report indicated hypercellular marrow with increased hemophagocytic histiocytes--findings consistent with a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
Aggressive therapy, including ventilatory support was removed.
# Bilateral infiltrates: The patient was diagnosed as having acute respiratory distress syndrome likely secondary to transfusion related lung injury vs. sepsis.
# Fever: The differential diagnosis for the patient's fever included an infectious process vs fever associated with ARDS.
# Renal failure: The patient was felt to likely be prerenal with hypoperfusion in setting of sepsis.
Urine lytes were consistent with a prerenal picture.
The patient was given aggressive fluid resuscitation with a minimal response in her creatinine.
# GIB: The patient had evidence of guaiac positive stools during her admission.
# DM: The patient was placed on an insulin drip for tight glycemic control.
