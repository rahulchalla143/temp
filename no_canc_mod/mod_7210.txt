Admission Date:  [**2163-12-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-12-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-12-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Nickel / Aspirin / Plavix  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1162**] Chief Complaint: abdominal pain and weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP  History of Present Illness: Pt is a 61-yo woman with PMHx of PUD, diverticulitis, s/p CCY, CAD s/p CABG, DM2, PVD, intestinal vascular insufficiency, chronic kidney disease, presenting with weakness and abdominal pain.
She had been having left-sided abdominal pain since Friday and had not been able to eat or drink anything.
Pain was similar to the diverticulitis and ulcer pain that she has had in the past, which she described as crampy and waxing / [**Doctor Last Name 688**].
The pain then developed into constant peri-umbilical and epigastric pain.
She had also been feeling very weak, lightheaded, and confused, with multiple falls at home.
She noted some nausea and loose stools, and a dark bowel movement at home, but denied any subjective fevers.
She is currently being treated with Bactrim for a left middle toe infection.
Labs significant for WBC >40, K 7.5, Cr 5.0 (baseline 1.3), and elevated LFTs (ALT 114, AST 163, Alk Phos 158, T.Bili 0.1), amylase (382), lipase (1665), and lactic acid (6.7).
CT Abd/Plv showed early pericolonic inflammatory changes [**1-14**] diverticular disease without abscess formation in the rectosigmoid, and associated small bowel ileus.
RUQ US was done to eval for cholangitis, which showed dilated extrahepatic bile ducts (12mm).
She was evaluated by GI, who felt that ERCP would be necessary given the suspicion of gallstone pancreatitis and ascending cholangitis.
On arrival to the floor, the pt was hypotensive and lethargic.
She had been given Dilaudid just prior to transfer, so her pressures initially responded to fluids, but she then developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and she became hypotensive again.
She was then transitioned to Amiodarone for her atrial fibrillation, and transiently required both Neosynephrine and Levophed pressors for hypotension.
After discussion with the ERCP team, the Surgical consult team, and referring SICU team at [**Hospital3 **], it was determined that the patient was at risk for ischemic colitis and would be treated as such.

GRAM STAIN (Final [**2163-12-14**]):       NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED.
Sepsis - When pt arrived, appeared to have septic picture but resolved during stay and by the time of her ERCP she was afebrile, stable hemodynamics, and without elevated white count.
She had been on Zosyn, PO Vanc and Flagyl, with the latter two being for concern for C. diff, and the former being coverage for bowel organisms because of a high suspicion for diverticulitis as the source.
She did have a positive UA at the OSH as well as chronic hydronephrosis.
We continued Zosyn for coverage of GI/GU organisms given earlier septic presentation; although we do not have clear evidence for what we are treating it is reasonable to think we have treated something given her clinical course.
Altered mental status - Pt presented from OSH lethargic and hypotensive, in the setting of initial concern for infection / sepsis as described above.
By the time of ERCP she was able to express her dissatisfaction with her circumstances but in a focused and oriented manner, and was certainly interactive.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response - After amiodarone loading she eventually remained in sinus.
Acute on chronic renal failure - Pt with known h/o chronic kidney disease, baseline Cr 1.3 per OSH records.
Original insult was likely pre-renal given sepsis / hypotension.
Pt has known history of hydronephrosis, presumed to be contributing to her chronic kidney disease, and likely due to fibrotic post-surgical changes in her abdomen from her numerous vascular surgeries.
Pancreatitis - The patient was noted to have elevated amylase and lipase at OSH as evidence of pancreatitis, but on admission did not have any evidence on CT-scan.
This was consistent with an evolving blockage and ERCP was performed and included stone removal.
Given h/o gallstone pancreatitis and acute cholangitis, a biliary sphincterotomy was performed.
Moderate dilation of pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas was noted.
[**Name (NI) 5779**] - Pt noted to have a [**Name (NI) **] at OSH, which has since resolved here.
Original elevation in AST > ALT, suggestive of alcohol as a possible cause of [**Name (NI) **] and pancreatitis; however this would not entirely explain resolution of [**Name (NI) **] with increase in pancreatitis.
More likely this has been an evolving blockage, perhaps from a migrating stone or transient contractions/strictures.
GI bleeding - By the time of transfer there was no current evidence for GI bleed; C diff and ischemic colitis were in differential as well for guiaic-positive diarrhea, but C diff was negative and clinical course was not consistent with worsening ischemic colitis.
Coagulopathy - Pt was noted to have elevated INR to 3.0 at the OSH, INR down to 1.7 on arrival, and was continuing to decline.
This may be secondary to temporary liver function decline, now resolving; or from sepsis earlier in her course.
Her wound culture is pending as of this dictation but it appears to be growing coag + staph aurues.
Diabetes mellitus type II - We kept her on ISS and QACHS fingersticks.
Hypothyroidism - Pt maintained on PO levothyroxine as outpatient.
We had kept A-line because of some difficulty getting blood pressures earlier; this seems to have resolved and if she continues to have uneventful post-ERCP course this should be able to be pulled.
PPx - venodynes, no heparin because of GI bleeding though if course continues well, could revisit this;  no bowel regimen given diarrhea but if stool output continues to reduce in quantity could consider gentle restart.
