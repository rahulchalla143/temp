Admission Date:  [**2158-5-26**]     Discharge Date:  [**2158-6-12**]  Date of Birth:   [**2121-2-5**]     Sex:  M  Service:  MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 37 year old gentleman with a history of end stage AIDS complicated by multiple opportunistic infections and long history of cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology who had been managed for several weeks as an outpatient with increasing episodes of diarrhea and a weight loss of approximately ten pounds.
Approximately ten days prior to admission, he had also begun to develop some shortness of breath associated with some chest tightness and coughing.
He had been seen in the Emergency Department where a CT angiogram of his chest had been performed and revealed a pneumonia and he was treated over the next week with Augmentin for this.
However, he continued to have pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath and temperature of 102.
On follow-up office visit to his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was found to have collapse of the right middle lobe on chest x-ray.
Given his ongoing pulmonary complaints as well as diarrhea and poor nutritional status, he was admitted to the hospital for further workup.
HIV complicated by end stage AIDS first diagnosed [**2142**], presumably secondary to heterosexual sex with wife complicated by multiple opportunistic infections including PCP times five, MAC and HSV, also with [**Doctor First Name **] brain abscess leading to seizure disorder complicated by DDI induced pancreatitis and complicated by peripheral neuropathy.
Questionable history of hypercoagulability, status post axillary vein thrombosis associated with PICC line in [**2154**], and status post deep vein thrombosis in [**2157-12-29**].
History of cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology, status post echocardiogram [**2-/2157**], showing ejection fraction of 25% with focal wall motion abnormalities.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in an apartment with his girlfriend and has visiting nurses once a week.
On examination, he was awake, alert and oriented, thin and comfortable in no acute distress.
He had thrush in his oropharynx.
The neck was supple with lymphadenopathy and no masses.
His lung examination revealed decreased breath sounds at the right base with a few scattered crackles and otherwise clear.
His cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremity examination revealed a palpable cord over the left medial thigh which was nontender.
He had no edema and had 2+ pulses.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Service for workup of pneumonia and diarrhea and was treated for a number of complications throughout his hospitalization.
Pulmonary - The patient had been treated as an outpatient for approximately ten days with Augmentin for presumed right middle lobe pneumonia which had not been improving.
During his stay, however, he was found to have bilateral deep vein thrombosis and upon reread of his CT concern was raised for potential pulmonary embolism.
For this reason, he underwent a CT angiogram on [**2158-6-6**], which revealed a large left pulmonary artery embolism as well as possible right sided pulmonary emboli.
Given his likely hypercoagulable state and evidence of thrombus despite presumably therapeutic INR levels, both the pulmonary and hematology teams were consulted to help guide his therapy.
The issues were discussed with the patient as well as among his attendings and it was felt that a filter would likely present a nidus for infection as well as further clot and was generally not worth the risks of the procedure.
The hematology and pulmonary teams were also concerned about the use of Epogen and whether a hematocrit of greater than 50.0 may be associated with high risk of thrombosis.
He was also treated for presumed pneumonia with Azithromycin and Ciprofloxacin to finish out fourteen day courses.
Cardiovascular = During his hospital stay, the patient experienced acute episode of shortness of breath associated with left sided chest pain.
Electrocardiogram was obtained which showed significant ST elevations in the inferior leads, and the patient was transported urgently to the catheterization laboratory for presumed acute myocardial infarction.
At catheterization, the patient was found to have an occluded right coronary artery and received 99 millimeters of stents with good final result.
He subsequently underwent an echocardiogram which showed a preserved ejection fraction of 50% although he continued to have right ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular dilatation and severe global right ventricular hypokinesis as a result of his inferior myocardial infarction.
He was also noted to have a small atrial septal defect of unclear significance.
His course has been complicated by multiple opportunistic infections as detailed above.
During his course, he was treated for presumed pneumonia which is felt to complicate his pulmonary emboli.
During his hospital stay, he was noted to have question of a line infection in the CCU and was treated with a fourteen day course of intravenous Vancomycin to cover for any true infection, although his blood cultures remained negative.
Gastrointestinal - On admission, the patient had been complaining of several week history of persistent diarrhea complicated by a ten pound weight loss.
He had undergone an extensive outpatient workup for infections which had been negative and this was again repeated during his hospitalization.
He continued to have episodes of diarrhea and was ultimately placed on Kaopectate for symptomatic relief given no infectious source.
Hematology - The patient has a history of clots in the past although a partial hypercoagulability workup had been unrevealing.
During his hospital stay, he was also found to have bilateral lower extremity deep vein thrombosis as well as a left jugular vein deep vein thrombosis associated with a line.
CODE STATUS:  The patient had previously indicated his wishes not to undergo emergency treatment should he decompensate acutely, however, in the setting of his chest pain and presumed myocardial infarction, the patient had decided to pursue aggressive measures and so his Code Status was reversed to full code for his hospitalization.
