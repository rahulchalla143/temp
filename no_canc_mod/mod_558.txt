Patient was also found to have abdominal tenderness and an abdominal CT scan was ordered, and per our wet read, showed dilated colon, with stool throughout.

Subacute fractures of the left superior and inferior and right superior pubic rami with evidence of interval callus formation.
No acute intra-abdominal process is identified.
Interval improvement of airspace process at lung bases bilaterally.
Stable small pleural effusions  2)Cxray ([**7-8**]): There is persistent left retrocardiac opacity, accompanied by basilar atelectasis and small effusion; pneumonic consolidation cannot be excluded.
Right basilar subsegmental atelectasis is unchanged, but there is no new focal airspace process elsewhere.
Right hilar prominence is unchanged, corresponding to known dilated right pulmonary artery.
There is a suggestion of gas-distended bowel loops in the upper abdomen, but no definite free subdiaphragmatic gas.
ecg [**7-27**]: Wide complex tachycardia, likely atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction and aberrancy.
Right bundle-branch block.
cxr [**7-28**]: Wide complex tachycardia, likely atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction and aberrancy.
Right bundle-branch block.
tte: IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Dilated ascending aorta.
She had respiratory failure in the setting of septic shock.
She had persistent hypotension while intubated, and required vasopressors.
She developed diffuse anasarca from volume resuscitation.
In addition to her fluid overload state, she was very weak.
She also had a pleural effusion that was tapped and was transudative after analysis.
It was felt to be due to volume resucitiation and diastolic heart failure.
She also developed a GI bleed, which was felt to be due to an upper source, and GI was consulted.
Once she was extubated, she had an acute event of possible aspiration vs. flash pulmonary edema that lead to her being re-intubated.
She had difficulty weaning off of the ventilator due to profound weakness and volume overload.
Then, she developed a tachyarrhythmia - atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.
Given that she had then completed an IV load of amiodarone, DC cardioversion was done again, and she returned to sinus bradycardia with a good BP.
She was given insulin, bronchodilators, mouth care, pressure ulcer prophylaxis.
