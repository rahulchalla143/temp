Patient otherwise at baseline, denying systemic complaints of fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, or shortness of breath.
Patient was afebrile in the ED.
Of note, patient recently discharged on [**2125-1-12**] after admission for leukocytosis.
He was found to have an anterior chest wall abscess at the site of a previous HD fistula with subsequent incision and drainage of the abscess by surgery.
2) Diabetes Mellitus, type 2, since ~[**2106**] with neuropathy, charcot foot, nephropathy, and ?
mild retinopathy.
2) Chronic renal failure on Hemodialysis and graft infections, thrombus: dx approx.
7) Hypertension 8) Hypercholesterolemia 9) LE Diabetic ulcers 10) Herpes zoster of the left mandibular distribution of the trigeminal nerve.
No frank blood.
18) Colonic Polyps 19) Gastritis with large hiatal hernia.
No abnormalities on CT chest in [**2121**].
24) MRSA- grew out from culture from L anterior chest wound  Social History: Pt.
NECK: Supple, No LAD, No JVD.
CHEST: R anterior chest with dressing C/D/I at site of prior abscess.
L anterior chest with surgical scars from access attempts, no palpable thrill over graft LUNGS: faint crackles at base, otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally ABD: obese.
BS normoactive EXT: Ulceration, chronic venous stasis changes.
Mild symmetric LE edema, DPs diminished.
Chest CT ([**1-22**]) New 2.5 x 2 cm fluid collection with air-fluid level consistent with an abscess along the course of a resected segment of the right dysfunctionalized loop catheter.
There is evidence of infection tracking along the residual loop catheter superiorly.
Left Arm AV Fistulogram ([**1-25**]) Left AV fistulogram and ultrasound Doppler showed completely thrombosed AV fistula.
Previously seen small abscess in the right subcutaneous tissue appears smaller on today's study, with small amount of residual stranding.
No focal consolidation seen within the lungs.
No masses identified.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
Interval worsening of previously described destructive changes within the spine.
Large hiatal hernia.
Allowing for this, no intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures is apparent.
There is a chronic left pontine lacunar infarct.
Mild mucosal thickening in the posterior aspect of the sphenoid sinus is present.
There is bilateral atherosclerotic calcification of the cavernous carotid arteries.
There is thickening of the posterior pharyngeal soft tissues, possibly secondary to increased lymphatic tissue, but infectious etiology cannot be entirely excluded, as opposed to a neoplastic process.
No acute intracranial pathology, including no sign of intracranial hemorrhage.
Chronic left pontine lacunar infarct.
Thickening of the posterior pharyngeal soft tissues, which could be secondary to increased lymphatic tissue.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-2-7**], no major change is evident.
male with multiple medical problems including HIV, HCV, ESRD on HD, who presents with clotted left-sided AV graft.
# Clotted graft: S/P thrombectomy of left chest AV graft, but reclotted during HD that same night.
A temporary right femoral line was then placed with no complications.
An order was placed to assess the left chest AV fistula, but due to a misunderstanding, a left arm AV fistulogram was performed by IR which showed a completely clotted graft.
For this reason, IR felt uncomfortable proceeding unless the patient was under general anesthesia.
Because of the multiple complications with access, no more attempts were made and the patient continued HD through the tunneled right femoral line.
# Hypotension/Resp Failure: Post op from the OR for I+D of his abscess on [**2-6**], the patient was found to be hypotensive and bradycardic.
ABG demonstrated findings consistent with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
# ESRD on HD: The patient continued in-house HD and was maintained on Sevelamer.
had a chest wall abscess, positive for MRSA on a previous hospitalization for which he was treated with Vancomycin for 14 days.
However, in the MICU, blood cultures grew Serratia marcens.
He was also thought to have C. diff.
He ruled out for C. diff x3 stool studies.
They recommended continuing his Vanco to complete 14 day course for MRSA abscess (through [**2125-2-19**]).
He will also need a VAC dressing for his chest wound until the wound is healed.
His delirium was thought due to infection.
# Depression - Continued Duloxetine .
, # DM: Patient experienced multiple episodes of hypoglycemia while on NPH and an Insulin sliding scale.
As a result, he is either hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic depending on how much and what kind of food he gets.
NPH was discontinued because of continued hypoglycemia.
His Insulin sliding scale was maintained so as to cover for any elevated sugars that occurred while on a regular diet.
# Chronic pain/hx heroin use - Continued outpatient methadone 20 [**Hospital1 **], percocet, which was down-titrated when he had mental status changes.
# HTN: Pt.
experienced episodes of hypotension, mostly after HD, but also separate from HD.

Please return to the hospital if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
You will need your VAC dressing until your wound is healed.
