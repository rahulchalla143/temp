Admission Date:  [**2139-2-27**]     Discharge Date:  [**2139-3-10**]   Service:  ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Barrett's esophagus with high grade dysplasia.
Myocardial infarction.
Cardiogenic shock.
Anoxic encephalopathy.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is an 84 year old male who had a long standing history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and Barrett's esophagus and had high grade dysplasia diagnosed on recent endoscopy.
The patient elected to have an esophagectomy performed.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, the patient is an elderly man in no acute distress.
Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub or gallop.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended without masses or organomegaly.
The patient was seen to have a low urine output and both metabolic and respiratory acidosis and was given approximately 8.5 liters of Crystalloid in the perioperative period, including OR.
On postoperative day two, the patient was seen to have a baseline oxygen requirement of 70% face mask in the morning but was saturating well and otherwise seemed to be doing relatively well.
The patient had a white count of 22.1 which prompted a chest x-ray showing bilateral pleural effusion and patchy bibasilar atelectasis but no focal infiltrates.
Over the course of the day, the patient had deteriorating in his respiratory status and became increasingly tachypneic with wheezing and coarse breath sounds.
An EKG was performed which showed atrial fibrillation but no ischemic changes.
The patient was transferred to another floor for Telemetry purposes and cycled for myocardial infarction.
Immediately subsequent to that the patient went pulseless and into respiratory and cardiac arrest and was down for approximately two to three minutes.
of brownish fluid was suctioned from the endotracheal tube post intubation.
Cardiac consultation at that time recommended aspirin, cycling enzymes and agreed with probable aspiration event.
The patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a troponin of 26.5.
In the patient's Intensive Care Unit stay, he was supported with a dopamine drip and diuresed for fluid overload.
Respiratory function was supported throughout his Intensive Care Unit course appropriately with mechanical ventilation.
The patient was noted to be unresponsive after the aspiration event, with some slow return of responsiveness over the next several days, but no purposeful movement.
To evaluate possible neurologic injury, a CT scan was obtained after the patient was felt to be stable enough to be transferred.
On postoperative day six, the CT scan showed no acute intracranial event but was consistent with chronic microvascular infarction.
EEG was also obtained which revealed diffuse widespread encephalopathy.
There was a question of possible seizure activity involving the left upper extremity and phenytoin was begun empirically.
A repeat EEG was obtained on postoperative day number 10 and again showed moderately severe diffuse encephalopathy with no seizure focus.
A Neurology consultation was obtained and assessed the patient to have minimal chance for a meaningful recovery.
