History of Present Illness: 65 year old male with hx of CBD stricture s/p Common bile duct excision, cholecystectomy, Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy transferred from OSH with abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting and WBC.
Patient states he was admitted to OSH last week for pancreatitis after having some abd pain and lipase checked by PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 21299**] slowly to full liquid diet and discharged home on Tuesday, [**2118-2-15**].
Then night of [**2118-2-16**] after a low fat meal, he developed severe epigastric pain, nausea/vomiting which lasted for 36 hours and presented again to OSH ED.
CT scan from workup from previous admission ([**2-9**]) to OSH shows pancreatic head mass, gastritis with possible GOO and evidence of portal venous HTN w/possible varices.
KUB was done which showed a nonspecific gas pattern.
On admission to the floor, he was vomiting dark black coffee ground material and reported melenotic stool x1 days.
A total of 400 cc of water was flushed with dark black emesis for return.
Emesis continued to return without flush and a total of 5.5 L of black (non-red) emesis was drained.
He reports no nausea, + vomiting overnight.
Past Medical History: CBD stricture s/p Common bile duct excision, cholecystectomy, Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy performed in [**2115**] at [**Hospital1 18**] (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] --->no malignancy identified on path however CBD pathology had areas of both low and high grade dysplasia - depression - s/p tonsillectomy - s/p elbow surgery - Carpal tunnel syndrome   Social History: Patient denies smoking, alcohol, lives with wife   Family History: noncontributory  Physical Exam: General: Alert, slight discomfort with NGT in place HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear NECK: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm no murmurs ABDOMEN: soft, Tender to palpation mildly in epigastric/RUQ region, right lateral abdominal wall hernia; non tender/reducible Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Skin: No jaundice, no spider angiomata   Pertinent Results: CT Abdomen 1.
Extensively infiltrating mass in the region of the porta hepatis, with vascular encasement, may be of pancreatic origin or represent an extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, as previously suggested.
Thrombus within the portal vein as well as encasement and occlusion of the splenic vein/SMV confluence.
Multiple hypodense liver lesions, unchanged.
Multiple lymph nodes within the mesentery and along the portocaval, celiac, and superior mesenteric regions.
Interval increase in small amount of free fluid within the paracolic gutters and the perihepatic space.
Interval increase in small bilateral pleural effusions.
Pathology: [**2-22**] duodenal biopsy: Duodenum, biopsy: Duodenal mucosa with chronic and active inflammation.
A few groups of atypical glandular cells, can not exclude   dysplasia.
[**2-25**]: ascitic fluid, perigastric area NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
[**2-25**] celiac node FNA by EUS NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Scattered small mature lymphocytes; no definite evidence of   lymph node sampling.
A few groups of glandular epithelial cells and   benign-appearing squamous cells, consistent with   gastrointestinal contamination.
EGD [**2-18**]: Esophagitis Blood in the stomach Duodenal ulcer Duodenal stenosis Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum .
EGD/EUS [**2-22**]: Circumferential non-bleeding mass of malignant appearance was found at the distal bulb, D1/D2 junction.
The mass caused a partial obstruction.
Appearances suggestive of extrinsic infiltrating malignant process.
Relatively easy passage of scope raises possibilty of paraneoplastic Gastroparesis as main cause of nausea as opposed to mechanical obstruction EUS examination  Normal diameter pancreatic duct seen in grossly abnormal pancreatic parenchyma Hypoechoic septated parenchyma seen from stomach.
Unable to pass obstruction with EUS probe, no clear view of pancreatic head.
5x5 cm lesion noted from duodenal bulb extending towards porta hepatis Heterogenous appearance with areas suggestive of necrosis, malignant phenotype.
Complete replacement of portal confluence by mass noted.
Multiple pathological perigastric nodes noted.
Periduodenal, perigastric ascites noted.
Coeliac axis examined carefully, there was no lymphadenopathy Cytology samples were obtained Cold forceps biopsies were taken from involved mucosa at the level of the infiltrating duodenal mass.

# Upper GI bleed, with duodenal ulcer, and acute blood loss anemia: Patient presented with large volume black emesis now draining >5L.
He was admitted to the ICU and an EGD on arrival to ICU: showed ulcer in duodenal bulb, evidence of Gastric outlet obstruction with concern for mass going into the lumen.
He subsequently underwent a CT Abdomen which showed a hypodense mass in the region of the porta hepatis which remained hypodense suggestive of cholangiocarcinoma.
# Portahepatis Mass: He was found to have a porta hepatis mass.
ERCP was consulted for evaluation, and he underwent EUS for diagnostic purposes twice, with no clear diagnosis yet obtained.
His final recommendations are awaiting results of biopsy, but if the mass is found to be malignant, as expected, it would be unresectable.
On [**3-20**] a gastrografin swallow was performed and demonstrated no evidence of extraluminal leak.
Once the NG tube was removed following the study, he was started slowly on clears and was then advanced to regular diet with no nausea, vomiting or increased abdominal pain.
# Duodenal obstruction:  On initial EGD, he was found to have possible duodenal obstruction.
He was started on reglan, and on a diet slowly, and had no evidence of obstruction, without nausea or vomiting.
He soon developed worsening abdominal distension and nausea and had his NGT replaced.
With placement of the NGT, his nausea and distension resolved.
# Depression: Restarted lexapro and will be continued with home dose and outpatient followup with his psychiatrist.
