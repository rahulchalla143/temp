Admission Date:  [**2182-8-15**]       Discharge Date: [**2182-8-22**]   Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  [**Hospital **] transfer from DWH for cardiac intervention  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with no significant past medical history with no cardiac risk factors other than age.
She called her son at the time who found her slumped over in the bathroom and called 911, unclear if there was loss of consciousness or trauma.
She was complaining of substernal chest pain, shortness of breath and nausea.
Electrocardiogram disclosed ST elevations in 2, 3, AVF, reciprocal depressions in V1, V2 and T-wave inversions in 1, [**Year (4 digits) **].
She was given sublingual nitro with a drop in her systolic blood pressure to the 80s.
By report, the intubation was traumatic and there was blood removed from the OG tube.
She had an episode of complete heart block to the 30s and hypertension which was treated with dopamine which in turn caused her to go into atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate.
She also had asymptomatic five to seven beat runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia while at the outside hospital.
She was subsequently taken to the catheter lab where a right heart catheter showed:  RA 15/10/8, RV 23/8/13, PA 24/15/18, PCW 14/13/12, PA saturation 61%; there is significant difficulty advancing the right heart catheter.
Anatomy LMCA separate ostia, LAD with mild disease, occlusion of OM1 which appeared old and collateralized by LAD, RCA subdural occlusion proximally.
The RCA received a 3 x 18 mm stent which was complicated by ............. reflow phenomenon which required treatment with IC diltiazem and adenosine.
She also required 1 unit packed red blood cells and [**Pager number **] cc normal saline bolus to maintain her systolic blood pressure.
Depression 5.
Actinic keratosis on the right wrist 7.
Hard of hearing  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Zantac 50 intravenous q8h  FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died of a myocardial infarction in his 80s, mother died in her 70s.
Two of her brothers died from myocardial infarction at ages 58 and 73, one from subarachnoid hemorrhage at 60.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, no alcohol.
Mild blood in oropharynx.
NECK:  Supple with no bruits.
CHEST:  Bibasilar crackles, no wheezes.
HEART:  Regular, 2/6 systolic murmur at left lower sternal border, normal S1, S2, no S3, S4.
EXTREMITIES:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Peripheral pulses bilaterally.
IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram from the outside hospital showed sinus rhythm at 53 beats per minute, normal axis, ST elevation in 3, greater than 2.
ST elevation in V5-V6.
Chest x-ray showed no effusion.
She also underwent an echocardiogram which disclosed an ejection fraction of 45%, 1+ AR, 1+ MR and the inferior left ventricle was akinetic.
It was difficult to extubate the patient due to the traumatic intubation that she had experienced at the outside hospital.
She was administered Decadron 10 gm q8h x48 hours to help prevent laryngeal edema following extubation.
GI consult was obtained to help evaluate the source of her upper GI bleed.
It was determined that the bleed was likely due to the administration of thrombolytics or NSAIDS.
On [**8-19**], it was noted that the patient had melenic stools but this was attributed to her upper GI bleed.
She was given Venodyne boots for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
Infectious disease:  The patient remained afebrile, however it was noted that she had an elevated white count which was initially attributed to stress dose steroids that were administered in the CCU, but urinalysis from [**8-21**] indicates possible urinary tract infection.
Acute myocardial infarction 2.
Hypercholesterolemia 3.
Urinary tract infection  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.
