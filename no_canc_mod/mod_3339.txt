Admission abdominal/pelvic CT demonstrated findings consistent with a partial gastric outlet obstruction.
He was given Dialudid IV PRN for pain with good effect.
Neuro: Initially, the patient received Dilaudid IV PRN, which was converted to a Dilaudid PCA with adequate pain control.
Upon admission he complained of headaches and was experiencing low grade fevers.
Given his history of advanced AIDS off anti-retroviral therapy and CNS toxoplasmosis, a head MRI with and wihtout contrast was performed, which demonstrated decrease size in the left basal ganglia abnormality and decrease in enhancement compared to a previous MRI performed on [**2153-9-21**].
Right base caudate head and adjacent basal ganglia signal abnormality is unchanged without enhancement.
CV: The patient experienced frequent episodes of tachycardia in the 110-140 range believed due to dehydration secondary to vomiting and substantial diarrhea.
Initial ECG noted sinus tachycardia without ectopy.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
Due to persistent nausea and episodes of vomiting on [**2154-12-3**], another NG tube was placed to low wall suction.
He continued to experience multiple episodes of diarrhea daily.
Episodic low urine output responded to the fluid boluses.
Initial differential included lymphoma versus infection.
On [**2154-12-2**], the patient underwent EGD with biospy, which went well without complication.
Friability and erythema in the gastroesophageal junction and granularity and erythema in the antrum and pylorus were noted.
ID: Patient with a history of HIV/AIDS with highly resistant virus secondary to a history of poor adherence with HAART.
Patient had been off last ART regimen consisting of Epzicom and Isentress as well as prophylactic medications for over 1 month.
Re-initiation of anti-retroviral therapy was held due to history of poor adherence with plans to re-evalaute readiness for HAART once able to tolerate oral intake.
The question of MAC prophylaxis versus treatment was again raised pending return of mycolytic cultures.
The patient was continued on nitazoxanide for diarrhea, presumed due to crytosporidium parvum.
The incisional wound located at the lower aspect of the midline incision, measuring 1.5cm x 1.5cm x 1cm, initially received moist-to-dry gauze dressings [**Hospital1 **], which was changed to a VAC dressing with white sponge at 125mmHg on [**2154-12-3**].
Given complicated medical co-morbidities and limited [**Date Range **] options, the patient was transferred to the Medical Service on [**2154-12-3**].
Medical Service [**2154-12-3**] - [**2155-1-4**]:  Fever:  Initial low grade thought to be secondary to crypto infection.
He completed 9 day course of Vanc for CoNS bacteremia which was discontinued after PICC came out and he had elevated levels for the next few days due to his new acute renal failure.
A lumbar puncture was performed and serum antigen negative, CSF antigen negative, suggesting that he does not have disseminated infection.
Even though he has had chronic productive cough without new changes, multiple CXR done during this admission were without evidence of PNA.
New spike on [**12-18**] was most likley due to post procedural inflammation from G-J tube placement.
Diarrhea/N/V: Likely due to severe cryptosporidium infection.
Patient did have hematemesis during his stay here and repeat EGD ([**2154-12-12**]) was consistent with severe gastritis and duodenitis due to crypto.
Multiple attempts for post pyloric dobhoff was unsuccessful due to either difficulty of the procedure or came out soon after placement with vomitting.
Unfortunately, the patient had recurrence of small bowel obstruction on [**2154-12-25**] and was transferred briefly to the MICU.
At one time his nitazoxamide was restarted briefly, though persistent nausea and vomiting on [**2154-12-31**] necessitated its discontinuation.
Partial gastric outlet obstruction/Abdominal pain/s/p ex-lap Pain initially was likely secondary to gastritis and incision site pain.
Appreciated surgery following patient on the medicine floor as his abdominal wound continues to heal.
Unfortunately, on [**2154-12-25**] the patient had recurrence of worsening abdominal pain with distended abdomen.
A CT showed high grade small-bowel obstruction with a potential transition point in the right lower quadrant.
Pattern of bowel gas was suggestive of air trapped in mucosal folds although pneumatosis could not be excluded.
On [**2154-12-30**], the patient's abdominal pain markedly improved, his GJ tube was clamped, and he was started on a clear liquid diet.
He tolerated this diet well until [**2154-12-31**] when he had multiple episodes of voluminous (> 500ml) of gastric contents.
This indicated persistent obstruction and the GJ was again placed to gravity with increased output.
Acute Kidney Injury: Patient went into ATN in the setting of volume depletion on [**2154-12-15**].
Renal US without evidence of obstruction.
Headaches The patient initially had headaches that were likely secondary to fever.
Neuroexam was nonfocal throughout hospitalization without evidence of meningismus  Patient had both MRI of his brain as well as an IR guided LP ([**2154-12-4**]) that were reassuring and did not show evidence of disseminated crypto.
Tachycardia The patient has been in a persistent sinus tachycardia at 100s.
Depression Throughout the patient's hospitalization, he was withdrawn with poor eye contact.
New rise in AP was concerning for hepatobilliary abnormality.
ERCP on [**12-9**] without evidence of AIDS cholangiopathy.
RML 3 mm pulmonary nodule A CT scan performed during his hospitalization revealed an incidental 3mm pulmonary nodule in the right middle lobe.
Phenol 1.4 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: One (1) Spray Mucous membrane HS (at bedtime) as needed for throat irritation.
Polyvinyl Alcohol 1.4 % Drops Sig: 1-2 Drops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for eye irritation.
Diphenhydramine HCl 50 mg/mL Solution Sig: One (1) injection Injection HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
