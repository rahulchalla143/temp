Pt states that on evening of [**11-14**], began having blood intermixed with stool, which continued through the weekend.
Has had no BPBPR since that time.
Overnight he went to bed, and this AM reported feeling very fatigued and therefore presented to the ED.
Currently, he c/o mild epigastric discomfort, which has been intermittent over the past few days and not affected by eating or bowel movements.
He has had [**Last Name (un) **] in [**1-/2193**] for evaluation of hematochezia, which showed adenoma in ascending colon, and bleeding was attributed to internal hemorrhoids.
No history of liver disease.
Also, has a history of anal fistula resected [**10-25**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 14190**] and Perianal sinus, excision with a single, 0.5 mm focus of invasive well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
-H/o adenoma s/p polypectomy in [**1-28**] -H/o internal hemorrhoids   Social History: Married, children, lives in [**Location **], insurance inspector, [**3-25**] beers on the weekends.
Family History: Father died of heart disease at age 72.
Physical Exam: Admission Exam: General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, mild epigastric tenderness, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Rectal: maroon colored blood/stool on glove, multiple skin tags but no external hemorrhoids   Pertinent Results: HCT: 40 (baseline from prior) --> 20-->26-->30->29  [**11-19**] Endoscopy: Erythema in the stomach body and antrum compatible with gastritis Erythema in the duodenal bulb There was no blood seen.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum  [**11-20**] Colonoscopy Diverticulosis of the proximal ascending colon and mid-ascending colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum Recommendations: Likely right sided diverticuli bleed now resolved.
Superior mesenteric arteriogram reveals conventional arterial anatomy.
There is no evidence of active contrast extravasation in the SMA territory.
Selective right colic and ileocolic arteriograms revealed conventional anatomy with no evidence of active contrast extravasation.
Inferior mesenteric arteriogram reveals conventional anatomy with no evidence of active contrast extravasation.
IMPRESSION: SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] arteriograms revealed no evidence of contrast extravasation in the SMA or [**Female First Name (un) 899**] territory   Brief Hospital Course: 41 M with history of hematochezia in [**2192**] (found to have internal hemorrhoids and adenoma of ascending colon), and h/o anal fistula in [**10/2190**] s/p excision w/ invasive squamous cell ca who was admitted for BRBPR x 5 days and HCT drop 40-->20.
#Acute blood loss anemia/GI BLEED: Had endoscopy revealing some gastritis of stomache body and antrum as well as colonoscopy revealing several ascending colon divericuli- thoughtlikely the source of the acute GI bleed.
Pt then had 2nd episode of GI bleed on [**2194-11-21**] with CTA revealing cecum as likely source.
Followup selective arteriography was neg for acute bleed source- likely missed the window of opportunity to intervene.
Had a few episodes of maroon stool a few days after but no further frank blood.
Pt's hematocrit stabalized and plan was for him to follow up with GI to get colonscopy within 1-2 months to definitely rule out AVM as source of bleed.
There was also some discussion that pt might ultimately need a right hemicolectomy if he continues to have uncontrolled bleeding episodes.
He will need to have scheduled colonoscopy appt made by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**] at that time to assess for AVM and definitely rule out.
#CLUSTER HA: Stopped his NSAIDs in setting of acute bleed.
Medications on Admission: Motrin 800mg PRN headache about [**2-20**] x/ week Omeprazole 20mg PRN gas about 4-5x/week   Discharge Medications: 1. pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Diverticulosis Acute gastrointestinal bleed Anemia Gastritis of stomache   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital for blood loss in your gut.
You had a thorough workup of your gut which revealed diverticuli as the likely source of the bleed.
(diverticuli are little pockets in the gut that can occasionally bleed) Your bleeding stopped and your blood counts stabalized.
The purpose of this is to carefully evaluate and determine if an arterio-venous malformation is causing your bleeding.
The only medication you should take for pain would be plain tylenol or narcotics if it is severe pain.
