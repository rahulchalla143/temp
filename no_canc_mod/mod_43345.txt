After a period of observation, she became unresponsive, had a wide complex tachycardia and no pulse.
Her left and right femoral lines were removed and a left CVL was placed as was a left arterial line.

Pertinent Results: IMAGING:  EEG [**2109-6-30**] This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The EEG background showed the slow cortical activity and bursts of generalized slowing throughout indicative of severe diffuse encephalopathy.
There were no clearly epileptiform features, and there were no electrographic seizures.
CT Head [**2109-6-30**] FINDINGS:  There are EEG electrodes in place.
There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or recent infarction.
No concerning osseous lesion is seen.
Fluid-opacification of the nasopharynx and nasal cavity, with layering fluid in the sphenoid and ethmoidal air cells and maxillary sinuses, likely relates to intubation and supine positioning.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is some loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation, diffusely, concerning for cerebral edema, in this context.
CT Chest [**2109-6-30**] FINDINGS:  Evaluation is slightly limited in the absence of intravenous contrast; however, the mediastinal vessels appear normal in caliber.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There are widespread extensive areas of consolidation and atelectasis extending from the hila bilaterally towards the bases.
No pneumothorax is present.
No significant pleural effusion is seen.
No concerning osseous lesion is seen.
Limited views of the upper abdomen demonstrate coiling of esophageal catheter within the stomach, though the entire course is not visualized.
Otherwise, no upper abdominal abnormality is seen.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of mediastinal vascular injury.
Extensive bilateral consolidations extending from the hila consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
The diffuse airspace process appears to have somewhat cleared, although there is a persistent opacity throughout both lungs and therefore this would favor resolving pulmonary edema rather than diffuse pneumonia or ARDS.
No pneumothorax.
Probable small bilateral layering effusions.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.

after heorin, and possibly other illicit substances overdose presenting to first to [**Hospital3 4107**].
While at [**Hospital1 **] she went in to ventricular fibrillation pulseless arrest and was resuscitated.
In addition to her cardiac arrest she was found to be hyperkalemic, have a transaminitis, leukocytosis, rhabodomyolysis, and acute renal failure in addition to her know diabetes mellitus.
Her troponin, which was initially elevated, decreased subsequently.
The decision was made to initiate theraputic hypothermia for neurologic protection.
A trans-thoracic echocardiogram was performed which showed no abnormal findings.
On [**2109-7-8**] she was transferred to the floor in good condition with no neurologic deficits.
#Hyperkalemia: Most likely due to hypoperfusion in the setting of shock.
#Transaminitis: Most likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis or hypoperfusion but we could not rule out viral hepatitis with her history of intravenous drug use.
#Aspiration Pneumonia: Initially her white count was elevated to approximately 30.0 there was concern that this could be due to septic shock vs acute phase reaction in the setting of cardiac arrest.
She was empirically treated with broad spectrum antibiotics considering that other markers such as fever or subjective complaints could not be assessed during theraputic hypothermia.
A CT chest done to evaluate a wide mediastinum in the ED showed extensive bilateral consolidations extending from the hila consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
Her sputum grew out gram negative rods consistant with an aspiration source.
She was switched to meropenem however she continued to be persistently febrile and have a leukocytosis.
Other possible sources of infection include a dental abscess given her poor dentition.
Prior to admission pt was on an antibiotic for presumed tooth infection since she was to follow up with dental clinic for a tooth extraction.
Dental came to see pt while in house and determined that she does not have an acute infection that was contributing to her fevers and leukocytosis.
#Widended Mediastinum: A chest xray showed a wide mediastinum.
The CT showed no evidence of mediastinal vascular injury.
#Rhabdomyolysis: On admission she had an elevated creatinine kinase that subsequently peaked at approximately 13,000 and then decreased.
Her rhabdomyolysis is most likely due to being down at home after toxic ingestion and exacerbated by her acute renal failure.
This was most likely due to hypoperfusion and exacerbated by rhabodomyolysis.
She was not hyperglycemic when found unresponsive so there is little concern of a diabetic ketoacidosis component.
#Chest pain: Pt experienced a single episode of chest pain while on the medical floors post ICU which last 6 hours.
EKG did not reveal any acute changes but she was found to have elevated troponins with a peak (.11->.14->.12).
She was started on aspirin and beta-blocker for NSTEMI although the significance of the elevated troponins in the setting of post cardiac arrest is not certain given that her troponin level was in the range of .05-.09 in the post arrest setting and there were no troponin levels for several days prior to the chest pain.
We recommend that the patient have a cardiac stress test as an outpatient to evaluate for ischemia and CAD given this episode.
-Pt should have a cardiac stress test as an outpatient given single episode of chest pain and rise in trops while in the hosptial -Pt is to follow up at the [**Hospital1 2177**] dental clinic for dental work and possible tooth extraction   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
