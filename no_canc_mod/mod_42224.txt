Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 102413**] Admission Date: [**2120-5-17**]        Discharge Date: [**2120-6-1**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  M  Service:   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Change in mental status.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Manor, who was found down on [**5-14**] intubated in the field for low respiratory rate and admitted to the MICU initially.
Also found to have pneumonia, UTI, and hypernatremia with a sodium to 152.
At baseline, the patient is wheelchair bound.
Reported gradual functional decline over the past week.
Patient was losing the ability to feed himself, less communicative, and increased confusion.
No medications were required for intubation.
Head CT on presentation showed no acute process and chronic right CVA with evidence of acute sinusitis.
Again, the patient ruled in for MI and evidence of ST depressions laterally.
On [**2120-5-17**], the patient had an acute episode of desaturation of 90 percent.
Patient was initially started on vancomycin for possible MRSA pneumonia since coming from a nursing home.
On [**5-18**], the MICU team was called to evaluate the patient on the floor for change in mental status and failure to protect airway.
EKG showed no acute changes.
Patient was sent for a head CT with concern for acute bleed and subsequently transferred to the MICU.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Old right frontal CVA with left residual hemiparesis.
Multiple abdominal surgeries secondary to shrapnel.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Patient was lethargic, lying in bed, no purposeful movements.
Positive horizontal nystagmus.
Neck was soft, supple, no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate, S1, S2, 2/6 systolic murmur at apex.
Lungs with coarse breath sounds worse on the right.
Patient is able to wiggle toes, open and close eyes, no hand movements.
Skin showed evidence of deep sacral decube without purulent drainage.
Urinalysis at that time showed no evidence of bacteria or red cells, however, urine culture from [**5-15**] showed greater than 100,000 colonies of E. coli.
Chest x-ray on [**5-17**] shows new right lower lobe infiltrate, no evidence of CHF.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:  Respiratory failure:  Due to poor mental status, patient was intubated upon arrival to the MICU.
This was for hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure.
Change in mental status was thought to be due to infection, dehydration, hyperglycemia.
Patient was treated for his pneumonia, which was thought to be secondary to aspiration with Zosyn and vancomycin.
Patient demonstrated minimal effort.
Patient demonstrated poor central drive.
The patient was ultimately bronched without evidence of obstruction or large secretions.
There is some evidence of pleural effusion.
This was assessed by Interventional Pulmonary team, however, on two attempts to perform thoracentesis, there is no fluid to take.
Patient was given Lasix for gentle diuresis and thought to decrease pleural effusions, however, there is no significant change.
The patient remained arousable, but still with difficulty protecting airway.
After multiple attempts with aggressive diuresis as well as optimizing other factors such as nutrition, electrolytes and mechanics, the patient remained ventilator dependent.
UTI:  The patient was treated with full course of antibiotics for pansensitive E. coli.
There was some concern for hypovolemia, which also may be contributed to poor mental status.
This was initially thought to be cause of poor mental status, however, the patient maintained normal sodium throughout hospital course.
Neurologic:  Initially on transfer to the MICU, no acute bleed by CT, however, there was evidence of evolving infarct.
New right frontal cerebrovascular accident.
Change in mental status.
History of multiple abdominal surgeries.
Hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure.
Urinary tract infection secondary to Escherichia coli.
Pneumonia (aspiration).
Acute sinusitis.
Acute myocardial infarction.
Arrhythmia (junctional rhythm).
