60min Post Cosyntropin stimulation: [**2148-11-29**] 01:55AM BLOOD Cortsol-7.0  [**2148-12-3**] 05:30AM BLOOD Cortsol-2.4  Brief Hospital Course: 56 yo female with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1A  who was failed treatment with pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and telaprevir in late [**Month (only) 205**], because of  severe rash, recently admitted for hyponatremia,  no presenting with hypotension and diarrhea.
#Hypotension- The patient presented with hypotension and received 10L of IVF in the ED.
A random cortisol was checked and found to be very low although this was drawn at midnight during the normal nadir so this was not conclusive for adrenal insufficiency.
Because the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency was not confirmed, her PM dose of hydrocortisone was held and an AM cortisol was rechecked was directed by endocrinology which was still low.
She was discharged with stable BP decreasing diarrhea and normal serum sodium levels on hydrocortisone 20mg QAM and 10 mg Qpm with endocrinology and PCP follow up.
#Diarrhea: She presented with hypotension in the setting of copius diarrhea.
This was felt to be most likely from adrenal insufficiency and/or viral gastoenteritis.
Her son did also have a recent diarrheal illness, however she has been having diarrhea for several weeks which is not consistent with a simple viral gastroenteritis alone.
It is possible that she had adrenal insufficiency and that the a superimposed viral illness caused her severe presentation.
#Hyponatremia: She had recently been admitted for hyponatremia and diagnosed with SIADH.
Her sodium was 134 on this admission and she did not have significant hyponatremia during this admission.
It is poosible that the prior episodes of hyponatremia resulted from ADH mediated free water re-absorption in response to hypovolemia from her adrenal insufficiency.
CHRONIC ISSUE: #Hepatitis C: Status post two attempts at treatment first with interferon and ribivarin in [**2144**] and most recently with interferon, ribivarin, and telepavir which was stopped for severe rash.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: #Steroid replacement: She was [**Year (4 digits) 8757**] that if she becomes ill in the future she will need to double the dose of her hydrocortisone and seek medical attention to avoid future episodes of acute adrenal insuffuficiency.
