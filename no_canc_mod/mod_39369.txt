Friability, erythema and congestion in the first part of the duodenum compatible with duodenitis.

Sigmoidoscopy [**2185-1-5**] Black blood filled the rectum and could not be washed away.

Cannot exclude prior inferior myocardial infarction of indeterminate age.
Delayed R wave progression and low QRS voltage are new.

# GI Bleed - Pt just had oral surgery for gums and has been on motrin.
Presented to [**Hospital 91974**] hosp initially after vomiting bright red blood and with BRBPR - found by son in pool of blood and passed out.
Had CTabdomen for distension but no evidence of perforations.
Hct remained stable around 27. no further transfusions.
Re-scoped [**2185-1-5**], found same ulcers still in stomach and duodenitis but with significant healing.
It was difficult to clear the rectum on sigmoidoscopy of black dark blood felt they couldnt r/o other source of bleed so pt went back to MICU temporarily.
Some melena while being turned likely old blood.
on [**2185-1-6**] pt had 30ccs frank blood per rectum, no stool.
Felt dizzy, HCT was stable and this was thought due to dehydration as pt had not been able to hydrate herself adequately on liquid diet.
However, on [**1-9**], the patient had dark stools with hematemesis with large clots.
Her Hct remained stable, but she started to have melanotic stools.
So she was taking for EGD and colonoscopy which showed no active bleeding from upper GI and blood on colon which was difficult to see.
She was noted to have an episode of dark slick stool (minimal) and she was re-scoped by GI on [**2185-1-11**], at which time they saw no evidence of active bleeding.
Warfarin was held throughout this admission and given the significance of her bleed she was sent home on aspirin for primary stroke prevention (CHADS score only 2 for afib and age).
#hypocalcemia - pt with low ionized ca in setting of massive transfusions, Ca was followed and was slighly low but only marginally.
#UTI - pt with equivocal UTI (large leuks, small blood, posiitve bacteria but no WBCs) Pt noted to have odorous cloudy stool s/p foley in MICU and was given 3 day course of cipro.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: We have stopped pt's warfarin in setting of massive GI bleed.
CHADs score only 2 for Afib and age, we have started aspirin for primary stroke prevention.

You were admitted with bleeding from your GI tract.
We found a bleeding vessel in an ulcer in your stomach.
This vessel was clipped and bleeding appeared to stop.
Your blood levels remained stable, but you did have another episode of vomiting blood and a bloody bowel movement, so endoscopy was repeated.
After this there was a repeat endoscopy which showed things were healing and no further areas of bleeding.
After this you had no further vomiting of blood, you had some dried blood in your stool which was the old blood passing through.
