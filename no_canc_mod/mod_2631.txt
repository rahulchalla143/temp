A CT abdomen and pelvis showed right sided nephrolithiasis with hyronephrosis/ureter with ?superimposed infectious process.
pneumonia and pyelonephritis.
CK was elevated to 1076, and BNP was elevatd to 1593 .
Her EKG showed diffuse T wave inversions, she had a leukocytosis to 24.9, a CXR reportedly showed a RUL infiltrate, UA was positive.
Tach-Brady Syndrome s/p pacer 3.
Hypercholesteremia 6.
HTN  Physical Exam: GENERAL: Pleasant, well appearing ..... in NAD HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
Neck Supple, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
No HSM EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
There is a new focal opacity in the right upper lobe.
Increased opacity also seen in left perihilar region.
Increased interstitial opacities and [**Last Name (un) 16765**] lines suggest mild pulmonary edema.
No large pleural effusions are identified.
IMPRESSION: New focal consolidation in the right upper lobe concerning for pneumonia.
Left upper lobe opacity could represent asymmetric edema or multifocal infection.
CT ABD/PELVIS [**4-16**] Bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent passive atelectasis is seen.
Patchy areas of airspace opacity are also identified at the lung bases.
There is a punctate calcification within the right lobe of the liver suggesting prior granulomatous infection.
Several left-sided renal stones are again seen, with obstruction of the upper pole collecting system.
Several right-sided renal calculi are seen.
There are several small right ureteral calculi distally measuring up to approximately 3 mm in short axis dimension.
There is moderate prominence of the right renal collecting system and ureter.
No gross evidence of a renal abscess identified.
There is suggestion of diffuse mild thickening of the colon.
Likely differential considerations include infectious etiologies.
Small fluid is identified within the dependent aspect of the pelvis.
No suspicious lytic or blastic bony lesions are identified.
Bilateral renal calculi.
Obstruction of the upper pole collecting system on the left and moderate hydronephrosis on the right.
Right ureteral stones are seen.
Bilateral pleural effusions and patchy airspace opacities noted at the lung bases.
Suggestion of diffuse colonic thickening.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 16764**] is an 83F presenting with likely septic shock.
[**Name2 (NI) **] was DNR/DNI and then made CMO due to ongoing respiratory distress.
In the setting of leukocytosis, a positive UA, and bilateral upper lobe infiltrates likely septic shock.
Possible sources included UTI/pyelonephritis and pneumonia.
Respiratory Distress: In the setting of pneumonia and elevated BNP with pulmonary edema on CXR.
Patient was also in rapid atrial fibrillation.
She continued to be in respiratory distress using accessory muscles of respiration and tachypnea.
She was made CMO and treated with morphine for respiratory comfort.
Supra therapeutic INR: Hx of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, INR 4.2 on admission.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
Patient treated for hypotension with fluids and pressors with pure alpha agonism.
Elevated CK- Cardiac isoenzymes negative, no history of trauma.
Patient was DNR/DNI then made CMO due to ongoing respiratory distress.
