H-CT [**2142-7-3**] IMPRESSION:  Mild effacement of the basal cisterns and crowding of the foramen magnum is concerning for increased intracranial pressure.
Mild cerebral edema cannot be excluded.
[**2142-7-3**] sinus CT IMPRESSION:  Relatively mild mucosal changes in the paranasal sinuses without evidence of osseous remodeling to suggest chronic sinusitis.
No evidence of acute sinusitis.
Normal MRI/MRV of the head, specifically without evidence of acute hypertensive encephalopathy, sinus vein thrombosis, infarct, or mass.
Low lying cerebellar tonsils and small syrinx in the proximal cervical cord that should be further assessed by MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**].
Mildly low-lying cerebellar tonsils without posterior fossa abnormality or crowding at the level of the foramen magnum.
Small syrinx at the C1/C2 level without evidence of associated lesion.
Otherwise, normal appearance of the cervical and thoracic cord, conus and cauda equina.
Mild degenerative changes of the lumbar spine as detailed above.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2142-7-3**] no change.
[**2142-7-5**] CXR IMPRESSION:  New peripheral left lower lobe opacity, concerning for developing pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 46 yo female with a hx of asthma requiring intubation in the past who presents with wheezing and shortness of breath c/w an asthma exacerbation in the setting of a probable viral infection, medication non complaince course c/b pneumonia and headaches found to have a chiari malformation and cervical syrinx  # Acute exacerbation of asthma Presentation was felt to be most consistent with an exacerbation of the patients known asthma secondary to environmental factors, URI and medication non compliance.
Initially, there was no e/o PNA on CXR (see below).
CP mildly concerning for ACS though normal EKG and TnI is reassuring.
Pt does not have risk factors for PE.
She was transferred to the floor where her symptoms persisted.
Her symptoms slowly improved and her peak flow improved to around 350 (reported baseline is 500).
# Hospital acquired pneumonia Throughout the patients course she complained of a cough which was initially attributed to her asthma exacerbation.
Two CXR's were checked on [**6-27**] and [**7-2**] and both were negative for an acute process.
During that time the patient didn't have a fever or leukocytosis.
Due to a slow recovery, a 3rd was checked on [**7-5**] and she was found to have a LLL opacity.
Her cough and symptoms continued to improve and as a result her coverage was narrowed to Augmentin.
She remained afebrile and her WBC was stable.
# subacute headaches/neck pain likely due to Chiari malformation The patient initially presented with mild headaches and then on [**2142-7-3**] she reported the "worst headache of her life" with decreased visual acuity, floaters and left upper extremity paresthesias in the setting of poorly controlled BP's in the SBP 170-150 range.
As a result, a H-CT was obtained which showed a effacement of the basal cisterns and a question of cerebral edema.
Neurology team was consulted and they recommended a MRI/MRV to rule out venous sinus thrombosis.
These studies were done and they were without evidence of acute hypertensive encephalopathy, sinus vein thrombosis, infarct, or mass.
They did show a low lying cerebellar tonsils and small syrinx in the proximal cervical cord.
The Neurosurgery service was then involved and recommended MRI of the spinal cord for further evaluation which showed a small syrinx at C1/C2 and mildly low lying cerebellar tonsils.
The Neurosurgery service felt that her signs and symptoms of left sided neck pain and headaches were due to her syrinx and Chiari malformation and the patient was strongly encouraged to follow up in the clinic.
She was treated in house symptomatically and her headache and floaters resolved.
Her only remaining symptoms toward the end of her hospitalization was left posterior neck pain/stiffness which was reproducible on exam.
# HTN, poorly controlled The patient had been on blood pressure medications in the past and it appears they had been stopped for economic reasons.
She was re-started on Norvasc in house to try and achieve better BP control, BB were not used due to her asthma.
# Constipation The patient was started on an aggressive bowel regimen.
# Chest pain- most likely [**2-8**] to coughing.
Patient was given Tessalon pearles and Guaifenesin for cough as well as Guaifenesin with codeine to allow for better sleep at night.
# Sinus Tachycardia Likely due to anxiety about discharge and albuterol treatment throughout her course.
# Complex social issues The patient requested social work support several times during her stay.
She reported housing issues in addition to difficulty obtaining medications.
