Her coronary artery disease risk factors included age and tobacco use.
The patient was in her usual state of health until the morning of admission when she started to experience a left arm pain while at rest.
The arm pain progressed to a substernal chest pain similar to a "brick on her chest", and was associated with shortness of breath.
She denied any nausea, vomiting, neck pain or back pain.
While there, she was found to have inferior ST segment elevations on an EKG.
In the catheterization laboratory, she was found to have a chronically occluded right coronary artery lesion of approximately 90% and acutely occluded 90% proximal left circumflex, which was stented with a 3.5 millimeter by 15 millimeter Zeta stent.
Her wedge pressures were found to be elevated at approximately 22 and she subsequently received 20 mg of intravenous Lasix to which she diuresed over 2.5 liters with a reduction in her wedge to 16.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Mother with coronary artery disease in her 70s; sister with angina symptoms in her sixties.
In general, this is an elderly female in no apparent distress.
She showed no jugular venous distention or carotid bruits.
There was no murmur, regurgitation or gallop appreciated.
Her extremities were without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Her neurological examination showed her alert and oriented times three with no focal abnormalities.
She had an isolated Q wave in lead III.
She had [**12-30**] millimeter to [**Street Address(2) 2914**] depression in leads V2 and V3.
Chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 61 year old female with a history of tobacco use who was admitted from an outside hospital with an acute inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction.
She was immediately taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory and was found to have two vessel coronary artery disease with the right coronary artery with a 90% lesion and an acutely occluded 90% proximal left circumflex artery.
The left circumflex lesion was successfully stented and the patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further observation.
An echocardiogram showed there was a mild symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity size.
There was a moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with a focal near akinesis of the basal two-thirds of the inferior and inferolateral wall.
No aortic regurgitation was seen.
The mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened.
Mild plus one mitral regurgitation was seen.
There was no pericardial effusion.
This lesion was successfully stented without any complications and the patient was returned to the floor.
Two vessel coronary artery disease status post a stent placement in the left circumflex and the right coronary artery.
She was also told to return to the Emergency Room if she develops any further chest pain, shortness of breath, jaw pain, back pain or any other cardiac symptoms.
