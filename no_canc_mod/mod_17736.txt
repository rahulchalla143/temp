There were multiple paraphasic errors in the form of neologisms when the patient tried to read or name.
Moderate dysarthria.
CN CN I: not tested CN II: blinks to threat bilaterally, no extinction.
Mild R pronator drift (fingers curl on the right hand).
No extinction.
Visual: No visual loss (0) 4.
Sensory: no sensory loss bilaterally (0) 9.
Language: severe aphasia (2) 10.
Ischemia in the distribution of the entire left ACA and MCA by mean transit time criteria, and a smaller area of presumed irreversible injury by blood volume criteria.
Total occlusion of the left internal carotid artery from its origin with partial reconstitution at the cavernous portion with attenuation of the M1 segment of the left MCA and occlusion of the superior division.
TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
In the first 24 hours after the procedure, he was not instrumented to avoid bleeding and antiplatelet/anticoagulation was avoided.
The following day he had an MRI/MRA which showed a L MCA infarct.
During his hospital course, he developed afib and was treated with metoprolol, aspirin and Plavix.
No Coumadin was used given concern for the increased risk of bleeding.
A TTE was negative for PFO or thrombus.
He was also maintained euglycemic and normothermia with Tylenol and SSI.
During his hospitalization he was also found to have a staph UTI.
After several days, it was evident that his dysarthria and dysphagia would not improved quickly enough to ensure his ability to safely take PO, therefore a PEG was placed by IR.
He also had weakness but antigravity movement of his R arm and fingers.
