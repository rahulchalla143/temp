There is a large 3.3 x 2.1 cm gallstone, however the gallbladder is not distended or inflamed.
Small hypodensities within the right kidney likely represent cysts, but are not fully characterized.
There are multiple low attenuation cystic lesions within the tail of the pancreas measuring 13 mm in greatest dimension.
An additional low attenuation 2.4 x 2.4 cm cystic lesion abuts the uncinate process of the pancreas, possibly arising from the minor pancreatic duct.
There is no peripheral wall enhancement.
There is no free air or free fluid within the abdomen.
There are scattered sigmoid diverticula without evidence of diverticulitis.
There is no free fluid in the pelvis.
Osseous structures demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Multiple cystic lesions within the pancreatic tail and 2.4 x 2.4 cm cystic lesion abutting the uncinate process of the pancreas.
Given the multiple hepatic cysts, these likely represent simple pancreatic cysts.
3.3 x 2.1 cm gallstone without evidence of cholecystitis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Mild interstitial edema.
Retrocardiac density may represent atelectasis or consolidation  EKG [**2100-11-24**]  4:58:56 PM Atrial fibrillation with mean ventricular rate 138.
Diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to previous tracing of [**2096-6-28**] cardiac rhythm is now atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.

## Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: Chronic, on digoxin and metoprolol at baseline for rate control.
Given decreased mental status, she usually did not take her evening metoprolol dose, which resulted in early AM RVR.
## Dementia: progressive, likely with delerium during acute illness.
## Cholelithiasis: no evidence of acute cholecystitis - outpt f/u .

She has had decreased mental status during her stay, particularly in the evenings.
