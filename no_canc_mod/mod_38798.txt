Brief Hospital Course: 73 yo F with history of seizure disorder and bipolar disorder who presents with altered mental status, hyponatremia, ?seizure activity, in setting of not taking medications and increased tea consumption, patient was admitted to the ICU and was stabilized.
?Seizure/Seizure disorder: Unknown if pt had recent seizure activity.
Withdrawel from benzos (takes ativan 0.5mg [**Hospital1 **] usually and has not been taking her meds recently) also possible in pt with tremor and ?seizure activity.
No further seizure activity.
ADH mediated etiology is considered since serum Osm is 250, however, urine Osm is lower at 170, suggesting this is not ADH mediated, and perhaps more likely psychogenic polydipsia, esp in setting of recent large quantities of tea consumption and increased urination.
Na 121 right now and pt possibly has symptomtic hyponatremia possibly contributing to seizures/AMS, on 3% sodium drip at 40/hr.
Did serial Na in ICU, and hyponatremia resolved and stabilized at 136.
Unclear etiology, normal lactate, Cr at baseline, no ketones in urine, starvation ketosis is possible but pt appears euvolemic on exam and no ketones, ETOh ketoacidosis is considered but again no ketones in urine, would consider ethylene glycol, salicylate and methanol toxicity in pt with psych condition.
Bipolar disorder: Takes olanzepine 2.5mg q 6hr PRN at home for bipolar.
When transferred to medical floor, she was appropriate, without evidence of mania or major depression.
6. olanzapine 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for agitation.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Nizhoni Home Care  Discharge Diagnosis: 1. hypovolemic hyponatremia with acute seizure 2. seizure disorder 3. viral syndrome 4. bipolar disorder 5. hypertension 6. hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
