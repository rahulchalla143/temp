Pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital 4199**] hospital from [**Date range (1) 33651**] after presenting with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure requiring intubation.
She was treated for COPD with IV antibiotics, IV solumedrol, and nebulizer treatments.
The pt had attributed her respiratory failure to seroquel and thus, seroquel was discontinued.
The patient was discharged on only Klonapin 0.5 PO BID, and per d/c summary, was strongly recommended not to have extra pain and anti-anxiety medications pescribed since they have caused significant lethargy and loss of respiratory drive.
Pt presents to ED today for request of pain and anxiety medications for abdominal pain and anxiety.
Pt reports that her doctor took all of her pain medications and that she has been having "wicked" pain since then with increased anxiety.
Pt also reports throat pain/soreness after recent intubation and extubations.
Of note, pt has been having continual oozing from G tube site which has been out for last 2 months per last note from GI.

The patient recieved a total of methadone 10 and klonopin 0.5 when she had a respiratory arrest with a max PCO2 of 132.
There, she was slightly hypotensiove requiring a small amount of dopamine.
She was weaned off the vent, and transfred to the floor on no narcotics or benzos.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure: She has a baseline hypercarbia secondary to likely COPD (although past PFT's unrevealing with poor effort) with extensive smoking history, but also has diagnosis of hypoventilation sydrome.
She had an acute on chronic exacerbation of this hypercarbic respiratory failure, most likely secondary to hypoventilation,  as she had normal A-a gradient and clinical syndrome of  decreased level of consciousness and bradypnea in the setting  of re-initiating her methadone and clonopin.
She will follow up in pulmonary clinic to have a outpainett sleep study since she may have central sleep apnea.
Recommend to avoid ALL BENZOS AND PAIN MEDS!!
Hyperkalemia on admission: unclear etiology; no K sparing medications.
No renal insufficency.
Possibly adrenal insufficiency in her clinical context.
ESR is only 3 so unlikely endocarditis or osteomyelitis.
TTE negative for vegetetations.
Chronic Abdominal pain and anxiety: Psychiatry saw the patient for anxiety.
She understands that she may never be pain-free as narcotics are not an option given her intubations in the past.
SLE, chronic steroids/immunosuppression: Recieved stress dose steroids in the MICU and then was dropped to Prednisone 20mg qday  Fluids/Electrolytes/Nutrition - She is very malnurouished after a gastric bypass.
Plan is for her to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of surgery and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12590**] of GI to plan for percutaneous J tube once her bacteremia has resolved.
She was somewhat volume depleted and so she was started on NS x 1.5L.
Most likely due to volume depletion.
Lidocaine HCl 2 % Solution Sig: Twenty (20) ML Mucous membrane  TID (3 times a day) as needed for sore throat.
Quetiapine 25 mg Tablet Sig: 1.5 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
