In brief, the patient is a 60 year old female who presented on [**2144-2-19**], with weakness of the left arm and leg to an outside hospital.
Head CT showed a large right basal ganglia bleed.
She was intubated and managed in the SICU by the neurosurgical service until [**2144-3-24**], upon which date she was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit team for further vent management and rehabilitation placement.
Throughout her SICU course, the patient had been intermittently febrile with an elevated white blood cell count.
Chest x-ray showed a left sided infiltrate and bronchoscopy with BAL cultures grew Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter sensitive to Levofloxacin.
The patient was treated with Levofloxacin as well as a short course of Bactrim for synergy.
Repeat gram stain of her sputum sent on [**2144-3-25**], shows gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters which likely represent persistent Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.
It is the feeling of the Medical Intensive Care Unit team that she likely has a resolving pneumonia versus a tracheobronchitis which is responsible for her continued secretions.
Her leukocytosis is not felt to represent active infection, however, is more likely related to her large intraparenchymal bleed and the ongoing inflammatory response related to that.
She has remained afebrile over the last week of her hospitalization.
There is no elevated jugular venous pressure in her neck, however, examination is difficult secondary to her obesity.
Her heart examination is regular with a normal S1 and S2, no murmurs or gallops appreciated.
She has a PICC line in the right antecubital fossa without surrounding erythema or discharge.
She has no skin rashes.
She has not exhibited any movement of the left arm or leg and appears to have a flaccid paralysis on the left side.
Chest x-ray on [**2144-3-25**], revealed partial resolution of the pneumonic consolidation in the left lower lobe.
There are no pleural effusions.
Right basal ganglia intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
