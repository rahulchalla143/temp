Also on the [**3-10**] the Neurosurgery team which continued to be involved in his care noticed that Mr. [**Known lastname 46630**] had what seemed to be cerebrospinal fluid leak from his right ear.
There was concern that this might be endolymphatic drainage from an inner ear fracture which was communicating with his basilar skull fracture or, in fact, a CSF fact also resulting from a basilar skull fracture.
A dedicated CT of the right temporal bone was performed and there was no fracture of the inner ear, therefore, it was assumed to be a cerebrospinal fluid leak.
Upon being discontinued, there was no further cerebrospinal fluid leak from Mr. [**Known lastname 46631**] ear and Neurosurgery was satisfied the CSF leak had been adequately treated.
He was also placed on an insulin drip and pan cultures were sent for a possible infectious disease workup.
Notable laboratories upon transfer were continued problems with glycemic control with blood sugars in the 400s as well as elevated transaminases.
At this point the Cardiology service was asked to consult on Mr. [**Known lastname 46630**] and their conclusion was that the troponins were elevated suggesting myocardial damage but not acute coronary syndrome in etiology.
This showed dilation of both the right atrium and right ventricle.
There was severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis with some preservation in contractility at the RV apex.
There was mild AR and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared to the echocardiogram dated [**2141-2-28**] there was severe dilatation and hypokinesis of the right ventricle and there was suspicion for a pulmonary embolism on that echocardiogram.
Bilateral lower extremity Doppler ultrasounds were negative of his lower extremities for any blood clots.
A CT scan-angiogram of the chest on the early morning of [**2141-3-16**], revealed large bilateral pulmonary emboli.
On the [**2141-3-17**] Mr. [**Known lastname 46630**] had an inferior vena cava filter placed by the Interventional Radiology team.
During the course of the rest of his hospital stay Mr. [**Known lastname 46630**] has been hemodynamically stable and stable from a respiratory standpoint.
His neurologic status has also continued to improve where he is able to follow commands, answer questions and participate in some activities of daily living.
Keep the head of the bed elevated at greater than 45 degrees (aspiration risk).
