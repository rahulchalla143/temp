Admission Date: [**2178-3-26**]        Discharge Date: [**2178-5-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2178-3-26**]        Sex:  F  Service:  NB  IDENTIFICATION:  [**Known lastname 32348**] [**Known lastname 19276**] is a 2 month old former 35 [**5-4**] week infant being discharged from the [**Hospital1 18**] NICU with a history of feeding difficulties.
Pregnancy was reportedly unremarkable until the day before delivery when mother presented with premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor.
Cesarean section was performed under general anesthesia due to inadequate epidural.
Rupture of membranes occurred 10 hours prior to delivery, mother was treated with antibiotics beginning 5 hours prior to delivery due to GBS unknown, and no maternal fever was noted.
She was transferred uneventfully to the newborn intensive care unit for her evaluation of prematurity and respiratory distress.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  RESPIRATORY:  Upon admission to the newborn intensive care unit, [**Known lastname 32348**] was placed on CPAP for mild respiratory distress.
[**Known lastname 32348**] was noted to have significant difficulties with desaturation episdoes with feeds (see below) but no apnea or desaturatiosn noted at rest.
She has had a soft intermittent murmur on examination which is likely physiologic and has not been further evaluated.
With advancement of oral feeds, [**Known lastname 32348**] was noted to have frequent episodes of desaturations associated with feeding.
The episodes were not clearly related to choking or discoordination of feeding, but would present as mild gagging followed by apparent apnea with airway obstruction, often requiring stimulation and oxygen.
These were initially thought to be due to immaturity, but with persistence of these episodes beyond full term, various interventions were tried, including treatment with reglan and zantac, thickening of feeds with rice cereal or 'Thicken-up', and feeding of breast milk alone or formula alone.
Feeding team evaluation was obtained, and issues were thought to be related to mild immaturity and discoordination of feeds.
A modified barium swallow (swallow study) on [**5-21**] showed better coordination of thickened feeds, although there was no aspiration with thick or thin liquids.
After extensive conversations with family and with gastroenterology (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 803**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from [**Hospital1 **], who follows [**Known lastname 40933**] brother for history of formula intolerance requiring Necoate), it was decided to place [**Known lastname 32348**] on Neocate formula thickened with rice cereal, under presumption that formula intolerance could be contributing to feeding difficulties.
Of note, father has a history of mild persistent hyperbilirubinemia of unknown etiology.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  [**Known lastname 32348**] is stable in room air, tolerating full volume feeds and has been free of desaturation episodes with a stable temperature in an open crib.
Of note she has a hemangioma on her right upper pharynx.
Chest symmetrical.
No dimple noted.
Respiratory distress syndrome.
