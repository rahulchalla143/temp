Admission Date:  [**2111-4-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2111-4-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2055-4-13**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and diabetes who presented with indigestion of five days induration unrelieved by beta-blockers and antacids.
The indigestion soon grew into chest discomfort which radiated into his left arm along with concomitant shortness of breath which began on [**4-16**], approximately 9 p.m.
On cardiac catheterization, distal LMCA was 90%, and left anterior descending was noted to fill from LIMA but left circumflex also supplies right coronary artery, so LMCA threatens left circumflex and right coronary artery.
Diabetes mellitus.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2104**] with LIMA to left anterior descending.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
No evidence of oral ulcers.
No cervical lymphadenopathy noted.
Sternotomy incision with no evidence of erythema or discharge.
No evidence of murmur.
Extremities:  Mild 1+ edema noted.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 55-year-old male status post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2104**] with LIMA to left anterior descending graft who presented with distal LMCA occlusion at 90%.
The patient underwent multiple hemodialysis to maintain electrolyte balance with initial hyperkalemia promptly corrected.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was instructed to go to Dialysis Center as planned previously, three times weekly, for expected maintenance of electrolyte balance, as well as fluid balance.
