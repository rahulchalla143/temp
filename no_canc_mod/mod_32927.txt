No definite focal consolidation is seen, although the evaluation is limited by the presence of the effusion.
There is a tortuous aorta.
There is a  dextroconcave curvature of the thoracic spine with the more cephalad aspects of the lumbar spine suggesting a compensatory levoconcave curvature.
No significant superimposed edema is seen.
No underlying pneumothorax is noted.

No definite focal consolidation is seen, although an early developing pneumonia cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination.
Short interval followup imaging recommended as clinically indicated.
Bilateral lower lobe airspace consolidation, left greater than right.
While there is a component of atelectasis, areas of heterogeneous enhancement are worrisome for pneumonia.
