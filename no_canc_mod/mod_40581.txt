She was found to have a ventricular septal defect with left to right shunting on echocardiogram.
She continued to fail, with significant lower extremity edema and weakness.
Past Medical History: ventricular septal defect s/p multiple back surgeries hypertension gastroesophageal reflux coronary artery disease s/p coronary angioplasty/stent s/p hysterectomy   Social History: Lives alone in [**Location (un) 26671**], retired office worker.

There is a post-infarction ventricular septal defect (VSD) at the basal infero-septal wall measuring 1.3 cm.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an echogenic density at the site of the previous VSD likely representing a patch repair.
There is no blood flow across the patch.
There does appear to be a small jet by color flow Doppler from the LV outflow tract into the RV.
Mitral regurgitation is unchanged.
Tricuspid regurgitation is moderate (2+).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No aortic stenosis is seen.
She was weaned from bypass on Epinephrine and TEE revealed no residual defect as well as minimal tricuspid and mitral regurgitation and the valves were left untouched.
She became hemodynamically unstable and progressively acidotic.
Cardiac catheterization was performed on [**9-25**] demonstrating patent grafts and an intra aortic balloon was placed.
Exploratory laparotomy was performed which reveaed low flow ischemic small bowel.
She developed ischemic feet and hands with sloughing of skin and coldness.
