Probable voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary ST-T wave abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Small right pleural effusion is demonstrated but no overt failure is present although vascular engorgement is seen.
No pneumothorax is demonstrated.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Atherosclerotic disease without significant stenosis of the internal carotid or vertebral arteries.
Acute infarcts within junction of the left thalamus and internal capsule and bilateral frontal lobes.
Multifocality suggests a central embolic source.
[**2119-10-26**] TTE The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2119-10-28**] CT chest/abdomen/pelvis IMPRESSION: Extensive arterial vascular calcifications, including among the coronary arteries, but no findings suspicious for malignancy by CT.  [**2119-10-30**] EEG (Prelim): No electrographic seizures  [**2119-10-31**] TEE No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
A very small patent foramen ovale is present but there is no passage of agitated saline from right atrium to left atrium with bubble study.
There are complex (>4mm) non-mobile atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (> 4 mm and mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Diffuse aortic atherosclerosis with complex (>4 mm) highly-mobile atheroma in the descending aorta and complex (>4 mm) non-mobile atheroma in the aortic arch.
Very small patent foramen ovale with no evidence of right to left shunting.
His exam was remarkable for a R facial droop with dysarthria and a dense R hemiplegia.
CTA head/neck showed atherosclerotic disease without significant stenosis of the internal carotid or vertebral arteries.
MRI/A Head showed acute infarcts within junction of the left thalamus and internal capsule and bilateral frontal lobes, multifocality suggests a central embolic source.
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis showed extensive arterial vascular calcifications, including among the coronary arteries, but no findings suspicious for malignancy by CT. TTE showed no ASD or PFO, LVEF 70% with moderate symmetric LVH and grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction.
TEE showed diffuse aortic atherosclerosis with complex (>4 mm) highly-mobile atheroma in the descending aorta and complex (>4 mm) non-mobile atheroma in the aortic arch, very small patent foramen ovale with no evidence of right to left shunting.
He had a routine EEG on [**10-30**] as he was having right arm and leg spasms s/p stroke, prelim read showed L>R temporal slowing.
Hypertension: On [**10-25**], he developed hypertension to 206/105 with chest tightness.
Arm Cellulitis: He developed arm cellulitis around the site of a peripheral IV, and was traeted with Cephalexin 500 mg PO q6 hr to complete a 7 day course.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Stroke - Acute infarcts within junction of the left thalamus and internal capsule and bilateral frontal lobes, likely embolic Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Arm Cellulitis   Discharge Condition: Right hemiparesis with a right facial droop   Discharge Instructions: You presented with right sided body weakness and slurred speech, and were found to have multiple strokes.
You had a trans-esophageal echocardiogram which showed 2 large atheroma in your aorta.
If you develop weakness or numbness, double vision or blurry vision, difficulty speaking or swallowing, chest pain, fevers/chills, or any other symptoms that concern you, call your PCP or return to the ED.
