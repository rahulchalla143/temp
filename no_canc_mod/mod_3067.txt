History of Present Illness: 30F with hypothyroidism and anemia history initially presented to ED [**1-16**] w/ [**3-21**] day h/o fever and diarrhea.
Patient was taking stool softeners daily with her iron pills and she attributed her watery diarrhea to overdose of the stool softener.
CXR showed cardiomegaly and an ECHO revealed a large pericardial effusion as well as intramural hematoma in aorta.
Emergent CTA of the chest showed a likely type A aortic dissection.
Of note, patient's initial INR was elevated at 1.8 and PTT was elevated at 45 which was of unclear etiology, thought potentially due to loss of bowel flora.
The aorta showed calcifications and inflammatory changes concerning for infectious process.
CXR showed L pleural effusion and loculated fluid in the L fissure.
In the ICU, patient had deteriorating mental status and 1 day of neck stiffness.
Mental status changes presumed to be due to either SLE cerebritis or hypoperfusion.
WBC continued to be elevated and low grade fever persisted.
ID determined that aortitis is unlikely of infectious etiology.
Patient was found to have low complement levels and Rheum was consulted.
Rheum suspected lupus/takayasu/giant cell as the etiology of pericardial effusion and aortitis.
Patient was also found to have low cortisol in the setting of hypotension.
An U/S was ordered and found a thrombus occluding L IJ and a thrombus in the R cephalic vein.
She complains of fatigue, a mild cough, and shortness of breath.
Iron deficiency anemia 2.
Shortness of breath of unclear etiology (DOE) 4.
Also bled alot during delivery but did not require blood transfusions.
Noted a history of irregular and heavy menstrual periods.
Family History: Maternal aunt with PEs, died of stroke and MI at age 50 Maternal uncle with bilateral DVTs in legs Mother with HTN Aunt with uterine cancer Aunt with diabetes   Physical Exam: VS 123 88/53 (MAP ranging 60-65), PSV 16/5 FiO2 0.32 100% GENERAL: Intubated, appears sedated HEENT: PERRL, intubated NECK: JVP not able to appreciate level.
Findings consistent with ascending aorta circumferential large intramural hematoma.
A focal outpouching along the anterior aorta just superior and to the right of the RCA origin appears unchanged from prior studies in [**2187**].
Large pericardial effusion with density greater than simple fluid raises suspicion for bleeding into a pericardial effusion.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Right upper lobe 4 mm nodule again seen.
New 3 mm nodule in the right upper lobe ([**4-29**]).
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  ([**2189-1-16**]) No evidence of hemorrhage or mass, appearance unchanged from [**2186-7-18**].
CXR ([**2189-1-16**]): Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette compared to [**2187**] may represent cardiomegaly versus pericardial effusion.
Prominence of pulmonary vascularity noted bilaterally suggests mild pulmonary edema.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
Mild pulmonary hypertension is present.
There is a large, circumferential pericardial effusion with large amounts of fibrin/thrombus on the surface of the heart.
No clear evidence of tamponade is seen, but this may be due to pulmonary hypertension.
Empty sella without evidence of pituitary micro or macroadenoma.
No enhancing lesions identified.
Arteritis involving predominantly wall thickening of the ascending aorta, although the entirety of the descending aorta is also involved to a much lesser extent.
No significant luminal narrowing is present.
Prominent wall thickening of the SMA is also appreciated.
Given the patient demographics, findings may be consistent with Takayasu's arteritis.
There is no evidence of involvement of the carotid or subclavian arteries.
Right-sided pulmonary embolism, as shown on the subsequent CTA of the chest.
Left internal jugular vein thrombus.
Bilateral pleural effusions, mild to moderate in size, greater on the right than on the left.
Pericardial Effusion Patient initially presented to the ED with diarrhea and fever for 2-3 days.
On CXR she was found to have large pericardial effusion, confirmed by echo.
Patient had pericardial effusion drained in the OR, revealing serous pericardial fluid.
After pericardial fluid drainage, patient's pericardial effusion appeared to remain stable, with continued pulsus paradoxus checks.
Most likely possibilites include rheumatologic diagnoses, including SLE.
Aortitis Patient was found on CTA to have intramural hematoma.
Then in the OR, patient was found to have aortitis with the following findings noted in the operative report: "inflammatory pathology with the complete matting of the tissues around the aortic root extending onto the ascending aorta with heavily calcific on the aorta all the way from the root to the beginning of the arch."
Differential diagnosis for patient's aortitis includes various vasculitides.
MRA showed thickening and inflammation of the ascending and descending aorta as well as SMA.
Patient had 1 [**Doctor First Name **] that was mildly positive.
SLE vs. Takayasu arteritis.
Patient was treated with high dose steroids for 5 days followed by 3 days of half pulse solumedrol.
DVT Approximately one week into patient's hospitalization, she was found to have left arm swelling greater than the right and was found on upper extremity ultrasound to have an occlusive thrombus in her left IJ and R cephalic.
She was also found with a PE and a L cephalic clot a few days later.
Hypercoagulable w/u showed one positive lupus anticoagulant so pt may have antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
Iron studies obtained prior to this admission suggested iron deficiency anemia with ferritin of 197.
Patient had a 3 week long menses which started 1 week prior to admission and finished 2 weeks into her hospital stay.
However, her hct was stable while on the floor and she required no more blood transfusions.
She was stable during her stay with no severe flares.
GERD Patient had numerous complaints of epigastric pain relieved by antacids.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 Puffs Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Adrenal insufficiency, secondary 4.
Pericardial effusion 5.
Asthma 3.
Coumadin:  This medication will help to thin your blood - this is particularly important for you given that you have clots in some of your blood vessels.
Levothyroxine:  Given that you have low thyroid function, this medication will provide you with thyroid hormone replacement.
Bactrim:  This is an antibiotic that should be used to prevent infections - we prescribe it to patients with chronic steroid use, which you will require.
In addition to the above, if you notice increased fatigue, chest pains, problems breathing, increased swelling or have any other questions or concerns, please be sure to call your primary care doctor or go to the emergency room.
