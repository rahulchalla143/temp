Past Medical History: -hypertension -type 2 diabetes mellitus -prior history of stroke; the pt stated that 3 years ago, he developed the acute onset of diplopia and left hand weakness.
Thirteen days after the original event, the pt experienced another stroke, again presenting with diplopia and left arm weakness.
He was uncertain of facial weakness during these episodes.
He stated that he was told that he had a stroke "near the sixth nerve in the pons."
Family History: Remarkable for a number of family members with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
No history of Alzheimer's, ICH, ischemic stroke.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: supple, no JVD or carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: RRR, nl.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: small ecchymosis over right knee.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
Able to name [**Doctor Last Name 1841**] forward and backward without difficulty.
There were no paraphasic errors.
was able to name both high and low frequency objects.
There was no apraxia or neglect.
There is no ptosis bilaterally.
Fundoscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages; venous pulsations present.
Tone slightly increased in the lower extremities.
No pronator drift bilaterally.
There was diminished pinprick sensation up to the level of the ankle bilaterally.
-coordination: No intention tremor, dysdiadochokinesia noted.
FINDINGS: There is a well-defined area of hyperintense T1 and T2 signal in the right occipitoparietal lobe with some mild surrounding edema.
Findings are suggestive of a mass, most likely metastasis, with associated small area of hemorrhage and mild surrounding edema.
No other discrete areas of enhancement or signal abnormalities are seen.
There is no mass effect, midline shift or hydrocephalus.
The abnormality in the right parietooccipital region demonstrates slow diffusion secondary to blood products.
IMPRESSION: Small 15 x 12 mm area of hemorrhage in the right parietooccipital region with surrounding enhancement indicative of an underlying mass with mild surrounding edema.
[**2104-10-4**]; BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler ultrasound of the right and left common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins was performed.
No intraluminal thrombus was identified.
IMPRESSION: No left or right lower extremity DVT.
CT EXAMINATION OF THE CHEST, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT THE ADMINISTRATION OF INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST, AND WITH ORAL CONTRAST:  INDICATION: 69-year-old male with right parietal lobe bleed.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous 5 mm axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis with the administration of oral contrast only.
Following, contiguous 5 mm axial images were obtained from the lung apex through the abdomen with the administration of intravenous contrast bolus, as well as three-minute delayed imaging through the abdomen and pelvis.
FINDINGS: No prior CT examination for comparison.
Evaluation of the lungs reveals a 6 mm calcified nodule within the right upper lobe (series 3, image 21).
No other focal nodules are seen.
There is atelectasis within both lung bases, left side greater than right.
No focal consolidation.
Evaluation of the mediastinum reveals calcified lymph nodes, likely from prior granulomatous disease.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There is calcification of the thoracic aorta.
There is a moderate-sized hiatal hernia, and gas within the mid and distal esophagus.
The mid esophageal wall is somewhat thickened, which could be related to reflex esophagitis, however, this would be better evaluated with endoscopy.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.
There are no dilated loops of large or small bowel.
There is no free intraperitoneal gas or free fluid.
Chunky calcifications are identified within the prostate.
There is marked distention of the urinary bladder, likely related to bladder outlet obstruction from the enlarged prostate.
No evidence of dilatation of the distal ureters.
There are loops of small bowel within a right-sided inguinal hernia, however, there is no evidence of incarceration or inflammation.
No suspicious lytic or osseous lesions are seen.
No evidence of solid mass within the chest, abdomen or pelvis.
Enlarged prostate, with probable bladder outlet obstruction.
Thickened esophageal wall, better evaluated with endoscopy.
In the region of right parietooccipital hemorrhage, no abnormal vascular structures are seen.
HISTORY: 69-year-old man with previous MRI revealing a hemorrhage in the right parietooccipital lobe and mass concerning for metastases.
MRA did not reveal  any abnormal vasculature in this area and a body CT was unrevealing as far as a primary neoplastic process.
INTERPRETATION: Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior projections and no focal abnormal uptake or penia was noted.
The  kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer excretion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of bony metastases.
[**2104-10-7**]: INDICATION: 69-year-old man with right parietooccipital hemorrhage, likely metastatic.
Assess for thyroid primary.
FINDINGS: Targeted ultrasound examination of the thyroid demonstrates normal thyroid parenchyma, without evidence of nodule or mass.
On admission, he had evidence of distal LUE weakness which quickly improved.
He also had a left inferior temporal quadrantanopsia which persisted.
MRI revealed enhancement underneath the bleed concerning for mass.
Therefore, metastatic work-up performed which included CT torso (normal except for thickened esophagus, enlarged prostate), thyroid scan (normal).
In addition, LP performed and CSF cytology negative for malignant cells.
Colonoscopy was deferred given negative colonoscopy several months prior and non-bleeding duodenal ulcer found of EGD.
Hematocrits remained stable prior to discharge and patient wothout any more bleeding after EGD.
Attempts were made to obtain outside records to determine baseline creatinine (given h/o diabetes and HTN, likely preexisting nephropathy).
This should be followed-up as an outpatient, however, patient without urination difficulties or symptoms prior to discharge.
HTN: BP was elevated on admission.
He required titration of metoprolol and lisinopril for persistently elevated BP into the 160s.
Metformin was held due to low creatinine clearance.
Dispo: Patient hemodynamically stable prior to discharge with no further evidence of GI Bleeding and non-bleeding duadenal ulcer found.
Insulin Regular Human  Subcutaneous   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: GI Bleed Diabetes Mellitus Parietal hemorrhage   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: Please call your primary care physician or return to the hospital if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, numbness or weakness, blood in your stools or black stools.
