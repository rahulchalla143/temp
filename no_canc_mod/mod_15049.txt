Admission Date:  [**2125-3-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2125-3-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2049-3-14**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 **]  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Unresponsiveness and seizures.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76 year old man with a past medical history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension who was brought to the [**Hospital6 649**] after being found unresponsive at home on the morning of admission, ([**2125-3-13**]).
He was in his usual state of health up until approximately one week prior to admission, when he developed fatigue, malaise and nonproductive cough.
On the day prior to admission, he had one episode of shaking chills, and was unresponsive for four to five minutes, without fecal/urinary incontinence.
There was question of seizures.
He was brought to the Emergency Department, and his fingerstick blood glucose was 28, he was subsequently given D50 and was discharged home after correction of hypoglycemia, with recommendations to decrease his insulin dose.
intake had been 4 for the past one week prior to admission, and she had not noticed any decrease or increase in urinary frequency.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus 2.
Hypertension 3.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy 4.
No history of seizures 5.
No history of surgeries  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Neck, supple, no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
Neurological examination, by neurology consult, reveals the patient is moving his left arm and left leg, but not moving his right arm and right leg spontaneously.
Funduscopy revealed sharp disc margins bilaterally.
His tone is mildly diminished on the right upper and lower extremity.
Withdraws right upper and lower extremity to mild noxious stimulation.
Urinalysis, specific gravity 1.014, large blood, trace leukocyte esterase, negative nitrates, positive protein, glucose 1000, trace ketones, red blood cells greater than 50, white blood cells 3 to 5, moderate bacteria, squamous epithelial cells 0-2.
IMPRESSION:  A 76 year old male with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and benign prostatic hypertrophy admitted with change in mental status, and subsequently found to be hyperglycemic with an elevated BUN/creatinine.
Given his good urine output after the Foley catheter was placed (2 liters drained), it seems that the patient's acute renal failure is secondary to obstruction, likely related to his benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Decreased mental status - It was thought that the patient's decreased mental status was likely secondary to toxic metabolic phase due to his hypoglycemia.
An electroencephalogram was done to evaluate for possible seizure activity, and the electroencephalogram revealed widespread and moderately severe encephalopathic conduction, affecting both cortical and subcortical structures.
There were no areas of persistent focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform features.
Abnormal electroencephalogram was slow and disorganized, diffusely.
In addition, a computerized tomography scan of the head was done to rule out any acute intracranial or extracranial hemorrhage.
Computerized tomography scan of the head revealed no parenchymal or extra-axial hemorrhage.
There was no shift in the midline structures or mass effect.
There was a question whether there was an ischemic episode, so an magnetic resonance imaging scan/magnetic resonance angiography of the head was performed, which showed probable chronic microvascular infarction of the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres.
There was on definite major vascular territorial infarction identified.
There were no definite areas of pathological perceptibility seen.
There was probable mild stenosis involving the supraclinoid portion of the right internal carotid artery.
There was no other definitive vascular pathology noted.
Secondary to the electroencephalogram, computerized tomography scan of the head and magnetic resonance imaging scan being negative for pathology, it is presumed the patient's mental status is secondary to his toxic metabolic encephalopathy secondary to uremia as well as to the hypoglycemia.
He was kept intubated for 48 hours, in case the patient developed pulmonary edema in the setting of acute renal failure.
Portable chest x-ray obtained on admission showed normal pulmonary vascularity, no evidence of failure.
There were no infiltrates, and minimal atelectasis of the right base.
There was no evidence of pneumothorax.
A repeat chest x-ray also showed atelectasis within the left lung base, and lung parenchyma unchanged in appearance.
No pleural effusion was seen.
Renal - The patient developed acute renal failure secondary to a post renal obstruction, likely related to his benign prostatic hypertrophy.
A renal ultrasound was obtained to evaluate the patient's cause of renal failure.
There was no definite evidence of hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis or mass on the slide but assessment was slightly limited.
Impression was that there was no evidence of hydronephrosis.
Renal consultation was obtained, and found that the patient's acute obstruction was likely secondary to the benign prostatic hypertrophy.
However, this was discussed with the Urology Team, and it is felt that this elevated PSA is unreliable in the setting of urinary retention.
The patient's primary care physician (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 48788**] of [**Hospital3 2358**]) was called and it was discussed that the patient has had elevated PSAs in the past, within the range of 15 to 16.
It was also discussed that the patient reportedly had had several prostate biopsies, with the most recent one being a couple of years ago which have all been negative for prostate cancer in the past.
Urology - The patient's bladder outlet obstruction is likely secondary to benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Though the patient's elevated PSA of 30.8 is unreliable in the setting of acute retention, his history of having elevated PSAs (15 to 16), indicates that he likely has an elevated benign prostatic hypertrophy, given the fact that he is also 75 years old.
By report from his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient reportedly has had several prostate biopsies which have all been negative for prostate cancer.
This was evidence that the patient had a bladder outlet obstruction and needs to have a Foley catheter placed chronically.
Urology was consulted to evaluate this patient with benign prostatic hypertrophy and with a failed voiding trial.
Urology consult felt that since the renal ultrasound was done after the Foley catheter was placed for bladder outlet obstruction (with return of 2 liters of fluid) that one would not expect to see hydronephrosis after the Foley catheter had been placed for acute renal failure secondary to bladder outlet obstruction.
However, with the discussion with the Renal Team, the Renal Service was concerned for retroperitoneal fibrosis secondary to ?
The Renal Team was concerned that the patient did not develop hydronephrosis in the setting of bladder outlet obstruction.
The Renal Team recommended doing an abdominal/pelvic magnetic resonance imaging scan to assess for retroperitoneal fibrosis, as an etiology for not developing hydronephrosis in the face of obstructive uropathy.
The Renal Team was concerned about retroperitoneal fibrosis induced secondary to prostatic cancer (which would encase his ureters).
Cardiovascular - The patient's electrocardiogram on admission was tachycardiac, with ST depressions bilaterally V4 through V6.
As these subsequently resolved, and the patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction with three sets of cardiac enzymes, there was no evidence of ischemic damage.
Endocrine - Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, the patient's home dose of insulin is specifically Humulin/NPH 40 units q. h.s.
Since the patient's insulin was lingering around secondary to decreased clearance of acute renal failure, the patient's sugars were cautiously watched during this admission.
It is recommended at rehabilitation, as the patient eats well and exercises more, that the patient's insulin dose be watched and increase and decrease for appropriate management.
Infectious disease - The patient was admitted with a white blood cell count of 18 and after the Foley catheter had dark chocolate-colored urine was drained, there was question of urinary tract infection as well.
The patient received a ten day course of Levofloxacin for urinary tract infection.
The patient remained afebrile throughout his admission, and his check today was clear as well.
Hypertension - The patient's home medication dose of Lisinopril, Hydrochlorothiazide, Norvasc, and Aspirin were held while the patient was NPO.
We are holding his Lisinopril in the setting of an elevated creatinine of 1.1 to 1.4.
Initially there was a question of aspiration, and ?
increased respiratory rate secondary to metabolic acidosis.
On the initial speech and swallow examination on [**2125-3-16**], the patient had tongue deviated to the left and was unable to protrude his tongue and even maintain protrusion for a short amount of time.
The patient demonstrated overt signs and symptoms of aspiration times one only, however, this was likely due to the patient's pulmonary status.
There was also evaluation which felt that the patient did not have a swallow deficit per se, but rather he was unable to recognize the purpose, schema of eating at this time secondary to confusion.
This revealed that the patient did not demonstrate any signs or symptoms of aspiration at bedside.
There were some mild oral deficits with pocketing of solids, as well as prolonged oral phase.
Small bites/sips should be recommended as well as checking for pocketing of food as well as to que the patient to clear his mouth as he eats.

The patient should have a voiding trial at this point in time and evaluation of benign prostatic hypertrophy.
with meals as needed for constipation 12.
Lisinopril is being held secondary to his renal dysfunction.
Given his diabetes mellitus the patient would definitely benefit from being on an ACE inhibitor.
