Admission Date:  [**2189-11-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2189-12-2**]  Date of Birth:   [**2131-3-10**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58-year-old gentleman with type 1 diabetes mellitus times 25 years complicated by retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy.
The patient is on hemodialysis on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday with a history of a myocardial infarction (status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2185**]), congestive heart failure (systolic failure) with last ejection fraction of 40%, history of hypertension, and history of hypercholesterolemia.
The patient presented to the [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department via Emergency Medical Service secondary to a 30-minute episodes of sudden loss of vision, and orientation to place, and a very cold feeling.
He denied chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.
he reported lower extremity paresthesias and lower extremity weakness.
The patient's reports his baseline status includes some shortness of breath with walking up stairs and distant walking, but he would quantify further.
He denied a history of chest pain.
He denies any lower extremity edema at baseline.
He recently had two weeks of abdominal pain and was still achy on his right side which occasionally radiated around to his back but never to his groin area.
He found no relationship with pain to meals or bowel movements.
He denied nausea or vomiting.
Type 1 diabetes mellitus times 20 years; followed by the [**Hospital **] Clinic with retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy.
Chronic renal failure; on hemodialysis on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at [**Location (un) 4265**] in [**Location (un) **].
Congestive heart failure with last recorded ejection fraction of 40%; systolic failure but likely also a component of diastolic failure.
Peripheral neuropathy.
Autonomic neuropathy.
Recent outside hospital admission for congestive heart failure and pneumonia in [**2189-6-4**].
Candidate for a kidney and pancreas transplant; followed closely by the Transplant Service.
ALLERGIES:  The patient reports allergies to AUGMENTIN (which causes nausea and vomiting).
FAMILY HISTORY:   The patient has multiple family members with diabetes mellitus.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed sclerae were anicteric with pink conjunctivae.
Positive jugular venous distention and jugular venous pulsation up to the mandible at 45 degrees elevations.
A 2/6 systolic murmur at the left sternal border heard best at the diaphragm.
No third heart sound or fourth heart sound appreciated.
No rubs appreciated.
Respiratory examination revealed the lungs were clear to auscultation but had some posterior crackles that were fine which migrated half the way up posteriorly.
Tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant and right lower quadrant.
Extremity examination revealed extremities were warm, dry, and no edema.
The patient had a left arm fistula without erythema or tenderness.
PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   There were no significant laboratory studies on admission.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  The patient had a computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis which revealed a calcified internal mammary artery, and no diverticulitis throughout.
IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 58-year-old gentleman with multiple medical problems with hypoglycemia, hypothermia, and abdominal pain; thought to be a presyncopal episode.
The differential included infection (either gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or through his arteriovenous fistula) as well as hypoglycemia secondary to too much insulin or a malfunctioning home glucometer; all of which would be a diagnosis of exclusion.
The patient had no evidence of congestive heart failure on examination.
He was admitted for rule out for myocardial infarction.
The patient had a computed tomography of the abdomen which had been in the Emergency Department which eventually ruled out diverticulitis as a source of his abdominal pain.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  To rule out infection, multiple blood cultures were sent.
At the time of admission, the patient had some chest pain in the Emergency Department.
An electrocardiogram done at that time revealed some peak T waves, poor R wave progression, sinus rhythm at a rate of 72, normal intervals.
A chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly and no effusions or evidence for congestive heart failure.
It was felt that the patient likely had baseline elevated troponin due to his chronic renal insufficiency and history of congestive heart failure.
That evening, while being monitored on telemetry, the patient had a 7-beat run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**] saw the patient and felt that the question of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was highly suspect.
Given his history of congestive heart failure and his need for kidney and pancreas transplant, an electrophysiology study was planned to evaluate whether or not he had any foci for ventricular tachycardia and whether or not he would need a defibrillator placed.
On the subsequent days following admission the patient reported having poor oral intake the week prior to admission and a poor appetite associated with dialysis.
[**Last Name (un) **] consultation felt that because the patient had received Glucagon during this hypoglycemic episode and it did not increase his glucose levels, it was thought he was likely having episodes of hypoglycemia because of low glycogen source secondary to his poor oral intake.
However, other causes of hypoglycemia were also continued to be worked up.
The patient remained afebrile and no longer became hypothermic.
The patient was frequently hypervolemic which complicated his blood pressure regimen.
The patient also had episodes of hyperkalemia for which he received Kayexalate which then caused vomiting and a questionable aspiration which caused his oxygen saturation to drop to 95% on 3 liters nasal cannula and then required a nonrebreather mask temporarily.
After that event, a chest x-ray was consistent with pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiograms revealed peaked T waves in strained patterns in V1 and aVL.
After this event of a congestive heart failure exacerbation, the patient's troponin levels increased again to 2.24.
Electrocardiogram revealed minimal changes.
The patient had multiple fleeting episodes of chest pain that resolved with blood pressure management and sublingual nitroglycerin.
The patient was given heparin for second rule out for myocardial infarction which was then stopped when his creatine kinase levels were negative.
It was unclear whether this was a non-[**Name (NI) 97425**] myocardial infarction or troponin leak due to congestive heart failure exacerbation.
All of this was discussed with the Electrophysiology consultation team, and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**], and the patient's primary cardiologist (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) who felt that the patient would benefit from having a cardiac catheterization to rule out any coronary artery disease.
After that, the patient went for an electrophysiology study which revealed no foci of ventricular tachycardia.
From this point onward, the patient was cleared by cardiac standpoint for any future kidney and pancreas transplant.
This occurred after his aspiration event.
Subsequent chest x-rays revealed a question of a right lower lobe infiltrate thought to be due to aspiration and vomitus.
The patient's oxygen saturations improved, and at the time of discharge the patient was breathing well and had no shortness of breath or wheezing and required no oxygen.
For his history of abdominal pain, the patient revealed no increase in liver function tests, and no foci for pain, and at the time of discharge the pain was resolved.
PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES:  The patient was quite depressed, occasionally with poor mentation which was thought to be due to poor glucose levels and post dialysis effects.
Once the patient was reassured that his placement on the kidney and pancreas transplant list was secure, the patient's depression resolved during the subsequent days.
The patient's blood pressure became a difficult issue.
He had persistent orthostatic hypotension due to his autonomic dysfunction.
The patient had no further chest pain after being ruled out for a myocardial infarction, having a cardiac catheterization with patent vessels, and normal aortogram, and found to have no inducible ventricular tachycardia.
At the time of discharge, the patient was instructed to follow up with his [**Last Name (un) **] physician and for further evaluation of whether his hypoglycemic episodes were due to low glycogen stores, or dosing his insulin too high, or an inability to read his insulin.
The patient was instructed to continue with his dialysis on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and to see his nephrologist there.
