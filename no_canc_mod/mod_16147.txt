started noticing chest discomfort which she is unable to characterize, tingling down both arms and feeling of racing heart a/w dyspnea while walking short distances on monday.
These symptoms lasted about 5 minutes and resolved after sitting down to rest.
noticed these symptoms came on this morning around 7:30 at rest and did not resolve until around noon.
These symptoms were not a/w diaphoresis or nausea.
had a minor heart attack while hospitalized for elective knee surgery, she states that it did not feel like these symptoms, she did not feel pain at that time, she just had a sensation of not being able to get comfortable in bed.
also complains of a feeling of the room spinning as she went to sleep last night, there was only one episode of this.
Her leg edema is at baseline.
She currently denies shortness of breath and chest discomfort.
Past Medical History: Diabetes type 2, dx 5ya CHF - EF 30% - Class I-II h/o Rheumatic heart disease with mod-sev AS (peak gradient 60, mean gradient 30, [**Location (un) 109**] 0.7 cm2), and mod MS (MVA 1.2cm2) LBBB Hypercholesterolemia.
Rotator cuff tear Fibroid uterus.
Venous insufficiency.
Aortic stenosis.
Atrial fibrillation on chronic anticoagulation  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: 1.
Family History: Positive for CAD in several family members, positive for an unknown malignancy in her father, and positive for leukemia in her mother.
[**Name (NI) **] family history of diabetes or hypertension.
Physical Exam: VS - 97.8, 124/83, 79, 18, 97% RA Gen: Comfortable appearing women in NAD, breathing comfortably HEENT: Mucous membranes mildly dry Neck: JVD to earlobes CV: High pitched crescendo/decrescendo murmur at ULSB radiating to carotids.
Ext: Chronic stasis changes in lower extremities bilaterally, varicose veins in lower extremities.
Left bundle-branch block.
[**2159-8-1**] CXR: Since the prior study, the degree of pulmonary vascular congestion and increased interstitial markings has increased.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Severe cardiomegaly persists.
[**2159-8-2**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %) (Quantitative biplane EF 41%).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2).
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed no angiographically apparent obstructive coronary disease.
Resting hemodynamics recorded during AF with a ventricular rate of 90, demonstrated elevated left and right sided filling pressures (mean PCW 29 mmHg, RVSP 68 mmHg, RVEDP 12mmHg).
There was moderately severe pulmonary hypertension (PA s/d/m = 66/30/47 mmHg).
The catheter was not advanced to the LV to assess transaortic gradients or LV pressures as the main purpose of this limited study was to assess her coronary anatomy.
Dense aortic valve and aortic root calcifications.
Mild calcifications involving ascending aorta, and aortic arch.
Mitral valve calcifications.
10-mm nodule in the left lower lobe, concerning for malignancy.
Diffuse predominantly perihilar ground-glass opacity, likely reflecting presence of congestive failure in the setting of cardiomegaly.

She ruled out for myocardial infarction.
She underwent right and left heart catheterization which found minimal coronary artery disease and revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension and moderate biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Workup was notable for a one centimeter left lower lobe non-calcified pulmonary nodule, concerning for malignancy.
Amiodarone was started for ventricular tachycardia post op which she converted after it was bolused.
POD 1 she was extubated with out complications and weaned from pressors.
She was transfused POD 4 for decreased hematocrit with no complications.
