No pneumothorax is detected.
There is cardiomegaly with a tortuous calcified aorta.
There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring suggesting CHF.
There is increased retrocardiac density and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
There is a small left and probable small right effusion.
TTE [**2106-7-10**]: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly elongated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical dyskinesis and near akinesis of the remaining ventricle.
The basal inferior and inferolateral walls contract best (LVEF <20%).. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical half of the free wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with extensive systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
Right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
RUQ U/S [**2106-7-11**]: IMPRESSION: Intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation without an obstructing mass or stone seen.
These findings might represent ampullary stenosis or post-cholecystectomy change.
If clinically indicated, MRCP might provide a different perspective on this, and definitively rule out an obstructive mass.
No hemorrhage, CT evidence of infarct, or other acute process.
Global atrophy, with extensive periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity, likely sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo woman with hx of CHF, afib on coumadin, recurrent UTIs, now presenting from NH with dypnea concerning for CHF exacerbation and also with abdominal pain and pyuria concerning for UTI, made CMO this admission and discharged on hospice.
# Goals of care: given CHF, worsening mental status, seizures, recurrent urinary tract infections and worsening renal failure, family meeting was held at which point decision was made to focus on comfort.
Acute on chronic CHF: Presented with dyspnea, and given history of CHF, elevated BNP, pulmonary edema on CXR, crackles on exam her presentation is most concerning for CHF exacerbation.
TTE demonstrated EF 20%, and hypokinesis suggestive of multi-vessel disease.
# Respiratory distress: Likely [**2-3**] acute on chronic CHF as above, in addition to possible PNA as evidenced by fever and LLL infiltrate seen on CXR.
UTI: Pt with hx of recurrent UTIs, now presenting with dysuria and pyuria suggestive of UTI.
Also with abd pain which is likely due to UTI as well given mainly suprapubic tenderness.
Per last evaluation at [**Name (NI) 2025**], pt was seen by urology and ID who recommended no abx unless pyuria and sxs, given desire to not breed resistance.
Pt also with history of c. diff which could be causing current presentation.
CTAP was unremarkable, except for intrahepatic dilation.
RUQ u/s was done to further characterize, and again showed intra- and extra-hepatic dilatation but not clear mass or obstruction.
# Renal failure: Slightly worse then baseline of 1.6-2.0.
Concern for poor forward flow in the setting of CHF exacerbation vs. ATN in setting of sepsis as discussed above.
# Altered mental status: Likely due to infection and seizure.
Mixed non-gap/gap metabolic acidosis: Gap acidosis likely due to elevated lactate and renal failure which may be contributing as well.
Continuing acidosis likely [**2-3**] acute renal failure.
Afib on coumadin: Rhythm pn admission appeared v-paced but without underlying atrial fib.
On HOD#1, pt had Afib with RVR during her MICU stay, requiring IV lopressor and dilt.
Coumadin was initially held due to supratherapeutic INR.
# GERD: Continued omeprazole.
# HTN: Continued clonidine.
# Depression: Continued citalopram.
