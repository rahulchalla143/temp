Admission Date:  [**2165-8-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2165-8-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-2-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MED  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxia, rapid a-fib, hypotensive  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: : 67 yr old male with multiple medical problems including recent intracranial hemorrhage s/p coil and stent with prolonged wean from vent requiring trach and peg, severe CAD, PE, CHF and UGIB returns from [**Hospital3 **] with decreased 02 sats, Afib with RVR, borderline hypotension and lethargy.
Pt noted to have thick sputum production and suctioning helped his sats.
Pt transferred to ED and given dilt but became hypotensive.
On last admission, pt was in rapid a-fib with good response to metoprolol.
In the rehab, pt was on metoprolol 50 tid but a-fib got more tachy as he started to have thick secretion and became hypoxic in the 80's.
Past Medical History: -CAD, s/p MI, CABG x 2 in '[**50**] and '[**62**], multiple stents -htn -s/p MV annuloplasty in '[**62**] -s/p AICD -s/p intracranial bleed [**5-28**], per HPI -mult L sided PEs ([**6-28**]) -h/o hyponatremia -VRE pos -CHF - [**6-28**] echo with EF 30%, moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction with near AK of inferior and inferolateral walls, sever HK of anterolat.
HEENT: PERRL, anicteric, unable to get mouth open Neck: supple, +trach CV: Irreg, irreg, no m/r/g Lungs: [**Month (only) **] BS bilateral bases with coarse BS bilateral upper lung fields L>R, no wheezes Abd: Soft NTND, no NSM, no masses, normal BS, G tube site c/d/i  Ext: no c/c/e Skin: Sacral + perirectal ulcers/ breakdown otherwise no rashes.
ICD site C/D/I, well healed stenotomy scar Neuro: Localizes pain bilaterally, no nystagmus, increased tone with marginal cog-wheele rigidity of bilateral UE.
Dilt lowers rate but pt became hypotensive.
Pt was taking that amount at rehab but had worsening of tachycardia which improved with suctioning of sputum.
Cause of worsening a-fib: hypoxia, CHF exacerbation, PE, MI, hyperthyroid, electrolytes inbalance, recent start of Ritalin.
Nl TSH, CTA showing neg PE, bilateral pleural effusion with possible CHF exacerbation.
Pt's PCP can titrate this dose further if his BP tolerates.
2)EKG changes: New ST changes in V4-V6 with decreased amplitude after beta blocker in HR 70's.
Most likely rate-related ischemic changes.
3)Hypotension: Pt became hypotensive after diltiazem, otherwise in normal BP.
Pt is either euvolemic or slightly fluid overloaded.
Patient needs to be diuresised with lasix since he has large amount of pleural effusion to diuresis.
4)Resp: Pt became hypoxic at the Rehab with productive sputm.
Most likely CHF exacerbation given bilateral pleural effusion vs. pneumonia vs. mucous plugging from bronchitis vs [**Last Name (un) 6055**] stoke.
Unlikely pneumonia since CT with no consolidation, pt afebrile but sputum with G+C and G+R.
Levaquin and flagyl initially given at the ED but was held since pneumonia was thought unlikely.
Pt noted to have [**Last Name (un) 6055**] stoke respiration most likely from CNS etiology given recent insult to vertebrobasilar distribution but CHF still a possibility.
5)CHF: CT with worsened bilateral pleural effusion worrisome for fluid overload.
CHF exacerbation could be the cause of rapid a-fib.
6)CAD: Pt with severe CAD hx with hx of MI, multiple stents and CABG.
EKG with ST depression on lateral leads most likely rate related.
Goal was to rate control for HR<100 with B-blocker, continue [**Last Name (un) **] & Plavix, atorvastatin 10 mg qd was initiated and pt needs to have his LFT's checked by his PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] should also be on ACE-inhibitor for his CHF and CAD.
Unlikely sepsis since pt afebrile and normotensive unless diltiazem given.
Pt with recent hx of vertebrobasilar bleed s/p stent.
Medications on Admission: Fragmin 255 u SQ QD, Ritalin 7.5 mg [**Hospital1 **], Sucralfate 1 gram QID, Metoprolol 50 mg TID, Amandtadine 100 mg [**Hospital1 **], Pantoprazole 40 mg NG [**Hospital1 **], Clopigdogrel 75 mg [**Last Name (LF) 244**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 325 mg QD  Discharge Medications: Toprol XL 25 mg per G-tube qd Lisinopril 5 mg per G-tube qd Clopigdrogrel 75 per G-tube qd [**First Name3 (LF) **] 325 mg per G-tube qd Digoxin 0.125 mg per G-tube qd Atorvastatin 10 mg per G-tube qd Protonix 40 mg per G-tube [**Hospital1 **]   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate Hypoxia Hypotension  Discharge Condition: Fair, stable, heart rate controlled under 100 bpm.
Discharge Instructions: Patient should have his digoxin level checked on [**8-15**] as well as his potassium level.
Pt needs to have his digoxin level and potassium checked on [**8-16**]
