Admission Date:  [**2109-5-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2109-5-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2063-5-8**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 45-year-old woman with a past medical history of back pain with pain medication addictions, who presented from an assisted-living facility with shortness of breath.
She denied any fever or chills.
This persisted over the next three days and was eventually accompanied by shortness of breath.
Chest x-ray showed diffuse pulmonary edema/ARDS.
When the patient remained persistently hypoxic and had increasing work of breathing, she was intubated.
Patient was admitted to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure.
Posttraumatic stress disorder.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of overdoses on medications.
No oral lesions noted.
Lungs:  Crackles at both lung fields.
Extremities:  No clubbing or cyanosis, trace pretibial edema.
Chest x-ray upon admission showed bilateral air space opacities affecting the mid and lower lung zones.
CT scan of the chest ([**2109-5-6**]):  Demonstrated diffuse alveolar process with ground-glass opacification and scattered areas of more confluent opacification, as well as thickened septal lines, particularly in the right lower lobe.
Differential diagnosis for this appearance is broad and included pulmonary edema, infection, and pulmonary hemorrhage.
Given the normal size of the heart, causes of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema should be considered, emphysema.
Otherwise, normal tracing with no acute ST-T changes.
Chest x-ray ([**2109-5-7**]):  Interval decrease in the extent of diffuse opacities over lung fields suggestive of improved pulmonary edema.
There are no pulmonary effusions.
Urine culture:  Negative with no growth.
Serum toxicology screen:  Positive for acetaminophen.
Hypoxic respiratory failure, diffuse pulmonary edema: Patient presented with an ARDS-like picture.
Etiology included infectious versus toxic ingestion related.
Permissive hypercapnia was allowed for.
Additionally, she was continued on Levaquin for the course of her stay in order to cover for an infectious etiology for her diffuse pulmonary edema, although her cultures returned negative.
Hypotension:  On [**2109-5-6**], the patient had an episode of hypotension to blood pressure of 70/40.
The patient required dopamine for this episode of decreased blood pressure.
Psychiatric:  A possible etiology of the patient's diffuse pulmonary edema included toxic ingestions.
As patient had history of overdoses, serum urine and toxicology screens were sent with results as above.
She was started on Ativan and Fentanyl to cover for benzodiazepine or narcotic withdrawal.
Impression was that the patient likely had impaired judgement and poor impulse control.
She may well have taken excess medications without suicidal intent.
Recommendations from Psychiatry included continuation of standing Klonopin doses ordered, and monitoring for possible alcohol withdrawal with treatment of benzodiazepines per CIWA protocol if clear symptoms of withdrawal.
Past history of overdose.
