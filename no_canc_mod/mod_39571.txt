The procedure was uncomplicated but shortly after presentation to the VICU, she complained of severe abdominal pain.
A noncontrast CT scan identified a large retroperitoneal hematoma.
In addition, pulses were noted to be absent on the left.
She was brought back to the OR for an ex-lap and left external iliac artery to superior femoral artery bypass with profunda ligation and left lower extremity fasciotomies.
She was transferred to the ICU for postoperative care where she was found on [**2139-1-2**] to have circulatory compromise to the right leg and was brought back to the OR for a right external iliac artery to superficial femoral artery interposit and right lower extremity fasciotomies.
Later that day, she was found to have a dusky pulseless left hand which required a left brachial artery thrombectomy.
Postoperative course was significant for acute kidney injury and respiratory failure secondary to massive fluid overload requiring mechanical ventiliation until [**2139-1-9**].
Peripheral Arterial Disease sp multiple vascular procedures this admission as above.
Acute Kidney Injury The patient has multiple potential causes for [**Last Name (un) **].
She received contrast on [**1-1**], she was hypotensive and underwent multiple surgies on [**1-2**], and she had muscle break down with a CK peak in of [**Numeric Identifier 94870**] postoperatively.
On [**2139-1-8**] a noncontrast head CT showed a single hyperdense left middle cerebral artery branch which may represent a focal occlusion.
The left arm weakness has since resolved.
