He did receive levofloxacin x1 but was without fever or infiltrate on admission to suggest pneumonia so antibiotics were stopped.
2) Bradycardia - The patient had bradycardia down to 20s on admission probably in setting of increased BB and increased digoxin dose and acute on chronic renal failure which may have decreased clearance.
He was given atropine with moderate response.
He is not a candidate for a pacemaker due to his multiple co-morbidities.
4) Acute on chronic renal failure - Likely secondary to low intravascular volume in combination with increased diuresis.
due to his respiratory distress and volume overload.
7) Anemia - Chronic GI blood loss on anticoagulation.
