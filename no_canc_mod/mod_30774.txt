Bronchoscopy   History of Present Illness: 72 YOF Hx of pulmonary hypertension who presents with massive hemoptysis.
Per the family had a recent hospitalization for heart failure.
Has been having small amounts of hemoptysis for weeks (less than a teaspoon).
This evening patient became acutely short of breath and hit her lifeline.
She fell ~ 2 days ago and has had abdominal pain ever since (mostly LLQ).
Was tachycardic and hypertensive, never hemodynamically unstable.
Given levofloxacin for empiric pneumonia coverage.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation 3.
Atrial fibrillation on coumadin 4.
Hypertension 6.
Chronic Pain syndrome 8.
Fibromyalgia 9.
Anemia: Iron deficency anemia with negative upper and lower endoscopy 14.
HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI without nystagmus, no scleral icterus noted, dried blood on lips.
Neck: supple, no JVD or carotid bruits appreciated Pulmonary: Lungs coarse b/l Cardiac:irregular, distant, tachy, nl.
S1S2 Abdomen: soft, diffusely tender, ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
ST depression in II, aVF, V4-6  CXR ([**2176-4-22**]): There has been interval placement of endotracheal tube, which lies 4 cm above the carina.
No focal consolidations are seen, and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
ABD US ([**2176-4-22**]): Cholelithiasis without son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of cholecystitis.
ECHO ([**2176-4-23**]):The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The severity of tricuspid regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure are now lower (may be related to technical quality rather than a true decline).
XRAY SHOULDER and HIP and WRIST ([**2176-4-23**]): Mild left acromioclavicular joint arthrosis.
No hip fracture.
Wrist - Diffuse demineralization.
Mild degenerative change about the articular surfaces of the scapholunate interval.
CT HEAD ([**2176-4-23**]): No intracranial hemorrhage.
Mild chronic microvascular ischemic  changes.
New large left pleural effusion, predominantly loculated.
Bronchomalacia bronchus intermedius.
Possible air extravasation.
Marked cardiomegaly, especially right atrial enlargement due to tricuspid insufficiency.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
Right lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, slightly increased, most likely reactive, but other causes such as neoplasm can not be excluded.
Decrease in left pleural effusion, status post left pleural catheter.
Loculated effusion persists in the anterior pleural space with new focal areas of air within the effusion that could be secondary to recent intervention.
Increasing atelectasis with consolidation of the right lower lung with opacification of the right lower lobe bronchus with endobronchial secretions.
Persistent cardio megaly and small pericardial effusion.
Hemoptysis/anemia: In setting of supratherapeutic INR (22) and pulmonary hypertension.
Bronchoscopy initially showed large clot across the carina but no active bleeding.
Repeat bronchoscopy showed slight ooze from LLL.
Again no active bleeding but a large clot.
After INR reversal and clot removal, patient no longer had hemoptysis and hematocrit remained stable.
Respiratory failure (pneumonia and pleural effusions): Patient intubated in ED for hemoptysis.
Extubated the following morning but had increasing respiratory difficulty through out the day and was re-intubated in early evening.
In addition to hemoptysis and heart failure, patient developed aspiration pneumonia.
CT scan of the chest showed left loculated pleural effusion that was tapped on [**4-25**] by IR showed 4+ PMNs but no organism.
IP further drained the L posterior loculated fluid (~900cc) and a pigtail catheter was placed on [**2176-4-26**].
Pt developed fever on [**4-27**] despite being on vanc/levofloxacin and aztreonam was added after panculture was obtained.
Repeat CT chest subsequently showed improved L posterior pleural effusion, unchanged L loculated pleural effusion (too small to tap) and increased opacities in the RLL.
and had no longer hemoptysis.
Congestive heart failure, diastolic: Initially BB/diuretics were held due to hypotension.
Her elevated INR was reversed as above.
Renal failure: Likely in the setting of blood loss and hypertension.
Mental status change: After arriving to the floor, the patient would become mildy agitated at night and would also become disoriented.
Pain: The patient presented with a history of chronic pain.
Based on prior PCP notes, multiple regimens have been tried with no only moderate success.
The first two medications were not restarted before discharge, but likely could be as the patient's blood pressure was no optimized.
Diphenhydramine HCl 25 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q6H  (every 6 hours) as needed for itching.
Lactulose 10 g/15 mL Syrup Sig: Fifteen (15) ML PO Q8H (every  8 hours) as needed for constipation.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime)  as needed for insomnia.
Lactulose 10 g/15 mL Solution Sig: Fifteen (15) ML PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for constipation.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Simethicone 80 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for bloating.
Pneumonia 4.
Pleural effusion 5.
Acute renal failure 6.
Chronic pain syndrome / Fibromyalgia  Secondary: 1.
Congestive heart failure, diastolic 2.
Atrial fibrillation 3.
Hypertension 4.
Tricuspid regurgitation 6.
Obstructive sleep apnea 9.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease 10.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after having hemoptysis (bloody coughing).
This was likely related to your pulmonary hypertension and an elevated INR (coumadin level).
