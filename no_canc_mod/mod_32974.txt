Mild heterogeneous plaque in the right internal carotid artery with less than 40% stenosis.
Significant heterogeneous plaque in the left internal carotid artery with 70-79% stenosis.
The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is calcification of the inferior midventricular segment.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
POST-CPB: On infusions of phenylephrine and epinephrine, AV pacing, preserved biventricular systlic function compared with pre-bypass, LVEF = 35-40%, MR remains mild, aortic contour normal post decannulation, no evidence of hematoma or dissection of aortic wall.
========================================= [**2129-7-8**] Head CT Scan: There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, edema, mass effect, or evidence of acute infarct.
There  is periventricular and subcortical white matter change as well as there is an old left basal ganglia infarct noted.
There is no evidence of acute vascular territorial infarct.
The mastoid air cells are hypoplastic bilaterally.
Ethmoid and sphenoid sinus opacification is also noted.

IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema is almost resolved.
Moderate cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusions persist.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.

He was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid ultrasound which showed mild heterogeneous plaque in the right internal carotid artery with less than 40% stenosis and significant heterogeneous plaque in the left internal carotid artery with 70-79% stenosis.
On [**2129-6-7**], Mr. [**Known lastname 953**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels with ligation of his left atrial appendage.
Please see Dr[**Last Name (STitle) 5305**] operative note for further details.
He remained intubated for a prolonged postoperative period due to hemodynamic instability as well as thick secretions impairing his ventilation/oxygenation status.
POD#13 Ventilator weaning continued until an episode of flash pulmonary edema which required increased ventilatory support.
[**6-23**] his mental status improved enough, along with hemodynamic and ventilatory stability that he was successfully extubated.
Over the next several days Mr.[**Known lastname 953**] remained in the CVICU due to his state of confusion, refusing medications and nutrition, requiring Haldol and need for pulmonary management.
Sleep consult was called and CPAP was initiated for obstructive sleep apnea.
Full anticoagulation was attained with Coumadin for his rate controlled, chronic atrial fibrillation.
Nutrition was consulted due to poor intake and aspiration risk.
Speech and swallow evaluated oral and pharyngeal dysphagia with recommendations for nectar thickened/ground solid advancement of po intake and tube feeds over night.
Given his flucuating waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status with visual hallucinations and agitation, the psychiatry service was consulted prior to discharge.
EEG ruled out epileptiform activity and head CT scan showed no evidence of acute infarct.
The head CT scan did reveal a chronic left basal ganglia lacunar infarct.
Given his delirium, it was recommended to continue Haldol twice daily and prn, optimize non-psychopharm measures(frequent reorientation, emphasize sleep wake cycle, dimming lights at night) and minimize benozodiazepines, opiates and anti-cholinergics.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution [**Doctor Last Name **]: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.

Discharge Instructions: 1)  Monitor wounds for signs of infection.
These include redness, drainage or increased pain.
In the event that you have drainage from your sternal wound, please contact the [**Name2 (NI) 5059**] at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1504**].
4)  No lotions, creams or powders to incision until it has healed.
Gently pat the wound dry.
