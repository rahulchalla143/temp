His longstanding DOE is not acutely changed with the onset of cough, but he is able to ambulate significantly less than baseline due to fatigue.
He reports leg weakness and back pain limiting his ability to get out of a chair.
He can only walk a few feet before feeling SOB, lightheadedness and needing to rest.
He denies chest pain on exertion.
He reports leg swelling that has been stable for 2 months since starting HD in [**12/2182**] and fluctuates with dialysis.
Per OMR, he has been coming to dialysis above his expected dry weights and has had 3-4L removed at dialysis sessions recently.
Of note, pt was just admitted [**2-28**] to [**3-2**] for diarrhea and abdominal pain.
CT abdomen pelvis showed no colitis or acute process.
Nothing to suggest infection or systemic illness.
On ED exam, had extremely faint bibasilar crackles, faint wheezing, difficulty taking a maximal inspiration due to cough, protuberant abdomen but soft NT.
Bedside u/s showed minimal effusion visible, no evidence of tamponade.
CXR showed fluid overload, so pt is admitted for HD to remove fluid.
He continues to have dry cough, but is otherwise comfortable in bed and stable.
Denies any more episodes of diarrhea or blood in his stool.

Small bilateral pleural effusions are not significantly changed.
Diffuse interstitial opacities with perihilar predominance are likely secondary to mild interstitial pulmonary edema, increased compared to radiographs from [**2183-3-1**].
No focal consolidations concerning for pneumonia.
There is no pneumothorax.
Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, not significantly changed.
[**3-8**] CXR MPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-7**]: Mild pulmonary edema has improved, severe cardiomegaly has not.
There is no large pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
[**3-10**] TTE Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global hypokinesis and relative preservation of basal inferior and inferolateral function (LVEF = 25 %).

Brief Hospital Course: 71M with h/o ESRD on HD (M/W/F), chronic systolic HF (EF 15-20%) s/p MI presenting with nonproductive cough x3d.
# COUGH On admission, patient complained of 3 days of dry cough and progressive leg swelling since last discharge 3d ago.
Grossly volume overloaded on exam & by CXR, likely the result of dietary indiscretion coupled with dialysis-dependent ESRD and chronic systolic HF (EF 15-20%) as below.
# CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE (LVEF 25%) Grossly volume overloaded on initial exam.
However, when he became acutely edematous and SOB while on a 1-day HD holiday, there was increasing concern for worsening cardiac output as the primary problem.
Chart review (see PCP notes from [**12/2182**]) reveal that at the [**Hospital1 112**] in [**Month (only) **] [**2182**], cardiomyopathy was attributed to irreversible ischemia in the mid-to-distal LAD distribution as demonstrated on Stress Echo.
At this time we also suspect interval worsening because of hypertension, worsening valvular disease, and/or cardiorenal syndrome with some additional, but not primary, contribution from dietary indiscretion/excessive fluid intake as above, because repeat TTE on [**3-10**] showed improved LVEF at 25% but worsening LV global hypokinesis & MR, TR.
# ESRD on HD On HD qMWF via RIJ HD line since [**83**]/[**2182**].
Initial reason for ESRD appears to be bilateral hydronephrosis [**2-27**] idiopathic obstruction, per [**Hospital1 112**] records.
Patient has been self-cath'ing for several years.
Cr was [**5-1**] at [**Hospital1 112**] in [**Month (only) **] [**2183**], then 10 here at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**Month (only) 1096**] - he was convinced to start regular HD here at that time, but continues to believe his renal failure is reversible and refuses fistula placement.
Patient counseled on low-salt diet, but may need more frequent and/or higher-volume dialysis sessions in the future if volume overload continues to be problem[**Name (NI) 115**].
There was concern that worsening heart failure (as above) was a major contributor to his increased dialysis needs.
# BPH Pt has chronic urinary obstruction, has been self-catheterizing at home.
UA showed pyuria as before; this was not treated.
At time of anticipated discharge on HD 10, he suffered large-volume urethral bleed after foley catheter removal (9 pt Hct drop over the subsequent 6 hours).
Warning signs of recurrent bleeding/outflow obstruction by new clot (bleeding, inability to urinate, pain/swelling in penis) were review with the patient before discharge - he agreed to seek urgent medical attention PRN.
Catheter removal was atraumatic, no further urethral bleeding.
# HTN SBPs initially ranged 130s-150s.
# UNEXPLAINED HCT DROP On HD5, labs checked at HD reflected 9-pt Hct drop since last check 24h prior.
While dilution from fluid retention pre-HD likely contributed, these was significant concern for recurrent GIB (given recent admission for GIB).
Transfused with 2U PRBC and transferred to the ICU given difficult access, unstable hct, relative hypotension (150->115), and possible need for endoscopy.
Underwent colonoscopy/EGD by GI consult, with no evidence of bleeding source.
CT abd/pelvis showed no evidence of RP or other intra-abdominal bleeding.
# LEG PAIN Pt complained of intermittent bilateral leg pain which resolved w/tylenol.
