[**2169-8-1**] EGD: Esophagus:  Protruding Lesions 3 cords of grade II varices were seen in the lower third of the esophagus.
Excavated Lesions Two non-bleeding 6-7mm ulcers were found in the lower third of the esophagus at the site of previous banding.
Stomach:   Other Old blood in fundus partially obscured view of mucosa - no obvious gastric varices but cannot exclude Severe portal gastropathy  Duodenum:  Other Duodenitis Old pills and old blood in duodenum Other procedures: 2 bands were successfully placed in the lower third of the esophagus.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-2-8**], there is less mitral regurgitation visualized, though image quality is now suboptimal.

# Recurrent Variceal bleed: as evidenced by EGD [**2169-8-1**].
# PSC cirrhosis: c/b ascites, esophageal varices w/ prior hemorrhage, hepatic encephalopathy, prior SBP, portal vein thrombosis - variceal care per above - restart lactulose and rifaxamin - continue cholestyramine and ursodiol on d/c - restart torsemide and spironolactone at home dose - 6L paracentesis done today with 50g Albumin after .
# Pain control: - q6 oxycodone - Fentanyl patch .
# Portal vein thrombosis - Tbili at 21.2 most recently.
## Leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
- restart pred taper: down to 20mg tomorrow if vasculitis symptoms stable/improving.
Last MRI ([**6-/2169**]) - horshoe kidney, no other abnormalities - restart diuretics at lower dose as Cr is stable - Given 50g Albumiin after todays tap .
# Esophageal candidiasis: was on 14 day course of fluconazole from last admit.
Seems to have resolved, though would restart if symptoms re-appear as this may exacerbate esophageal issues.
