Several hours later, he experienced another massive GI bleed and was taken back for angiography that demonstrated likely fistula from the artery in the pancreatic allograft to the small bowel.
He experienced hypovolemia as well as  compartment syndrome and coded.
He required emergent exploratory laparotomy in radiology with ligation of arterial inflow to pancreatic allograft, small bowel resection, bilateral chest tube placement, and removal of percutaneously placed right common iliac balloon.
See operative note for complete details.
Chest tubes remained to water seal without pneumothorax noted on CXR.
A lasix drip was started for massive edema.
Radiology removed the bilateral groin sheaths without incident.
On [**8-23**], bilateral CT's were removed with post CXR demonstrating a tiny L apical PTX that resolved spontaneously.
On [**8-25**], Vanco and Zosyn were started for empiric pneumonia coverage.
CXR showed bilateral perihilar (right greater than left)and bibasilar (left greater than right) opacities and bilateral pleural effusions.
Oxycodone was given for pain control.
He developed a metabolic alkalosis and Lasix drip was held.
CXR showed improved pleural effusions.
On [**8-28**], he self-d/c'd the feeding tube and was experiencing nausea and bilious emesis.
KUB did not show signs of obstruction.
On [**8-29**], a CT scan with PO contrast demonstrated partial SBO dilated bowel proximal to anastomosis and decompressed bowel distally, positive contrast in colon.
NG continued with bilious output.
He also experienced mental status changes and decreased movement of LLE.
Head CT demonstrated no evidence of territorial infarction or hemorrhage.
No DVT was seen.
Stool was sent for C.diff and was negative X2.
PT was consulted and worked with him daily initially noting orthostasis and patient complaints of dizziness.
These signs and symptoms improved with improved mobility.
