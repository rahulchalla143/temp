He was in his USOH until [**2101-1-27**] when at noon he developed substernal chest "burning" while sitting at his office.
She thought he might have been hypoglycemia and gave him some coke, after which his symptoms improved.
A Head CT was   (-) for bleed and Trop-I+ 0.87.
He has chest pain with lifting boxes.
LIMA>>LAD, SVG>>Diag -[**9-28**] ETT Thal for 2 minutes with HR 130, 2 mm horizontal lateral ST depressions.
##non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus x 10 years.
##hypertension ##hypercholesterolemia ##Stroke/TIA with no residual defects.
2 adopted children.
Soft II/VI systolic murmur at LLSB.
Pulm: CTA B/L ABD: S/NT/ND Ext: no edema.
CXR: No CP processes  [**2101-1-27**]: Chronic Right Occipital Cortical Infarct, chronic deep white matter infarction due to small vessel disease, small lacunar infarct in left thalamus.
Significant native coronary artery disease.
Severe bilateral internal carotid artery disease.
Arterial disease in the left subclavian and bilateral vertebrals 4.
Successful employment of AccuNet distal embolic protection.
Limited coronary angiography demonstrated a right dominant system with left main and severe native vessel disease.
The proximal and midvessel LAD had diffuse calcific disease.
The LCx had mild diffuse disease.
Retrograde access of the left common femoral artery was obtained for selective carotid, vertebral, and coronary angiography.
The thoracic aorta had a Type I arch.
The bilateral subclavian arteries had mild proximal disease.
The left subclavian artery had a 50% lesion in the origin with a peak to peak gradient of 20 mmHg.
The right vertebral artery was small and diminutive with a total occlusion at the base of the skull before entering the brain.
The left vertebral artery was large and was noted to have a 60% origin lesion and filled the basilar and the cerebellar arteries.
The left common carotid artery was without disease but the ICA had diffuse tubular 80% disease.
Successful placement of a [**5-4**] x 40 mm Acculink stent in the left ICA postdilated with a 4.5 mm balloon.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
Transient, self-limited myoclonic event during postdilation which was though not likely to represent seizure activity.
Successful Perclose of the left femoral arteriotomy site at the conclusion of the procedure without complications.
Cath at OSH [**8-30**]: "multiple tight stenoses of the proximal LAD and proximal D1.
Left carotid patent, right carotid occluded."
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system.
The D1 had a 80% calcific stenosis at the origin.
The LCX had mild diffuise disease.
Unsuccessful attempt at PTCA/stenting of the D1 due to inability to cross despite using multiple wires.
Rotational atherectomy was performed in the LAD in an attempt to modify the LAD lesion and allow crossing inro the D1 (See PTCA comments).
There is no flow in internal carotid artery including power Doppler technique.
male with CAD status post CABG, history of TIA with bilateral carotid stenosis presents s/p episode of chest pain and aphasia with borderline elevation in TN-I and non-specific ant/lateral ST-T wave changes.
He was admitted for coronary and carotid cath.Patient had cardiac catheterization on [**2101-2-2**] and was discovered to have severe bilateral internal carotid artery disease and also arterial disease in the left subclavian and bilateral vertebrals.
Successful placement of self-expanding stent in left ICA and successful employment of AccuNet distal embolic protection.
He did well and has no neurological events.
