She was having cough with some sputum production.
She was responsive on the morning of admission but very lethargic and also had incontinence.
The patient and family were frustrated with the fact that the patient had been at home for only 2 weeks of the last 7 months and she had a poor quality of life.
The husband did not want any aggressive measures which included no NG tube, no pressors and the goal was to make her comfortable and to try only IV medications if required.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage in this patient on coumadin or any other explanation for her altered mental status.
HISTORY: 66-year-old female with multiple medical problems presenting with altered mental status.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images through the brain were acquired without IV contrast administration.
FINDINGS: No evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or large vascular territory infarction is present.
Ventricular configuration is not changed.
Vascular calcifications are noted in the intracranial vertebral arteries and the internal carotid arteries.
Compared to [**2180-8-8**], there is new opacification of some ethmoid air cells and mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus.
The remainder of the visualized paranasal sinuses and the mastoid air cells are well aerated.
No fracture is present.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Left maxillary and ethmoid sinus disease.
There is likely some increase in the moderate-to-large left pleural effusion compared to the study performed nearly a month prior.
The left retrocardiac opacity persists, likely representing pleural effusion, associated atelectasis, although underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
The cardiac silhouette is obscured on the left by the pleural effusion and atelectasis; however, there is likely stable cardiomegaly.
Prominence of the pulmonary vessels is consistent with pulmonary venous congestion and indistinctness of the pulmonary vessels likely represents interstitial edema.
No focal airspace opacities are seen in the right lung or left upper lung.
There may be some increase in the left pleural effusion which is now likely moderate to large in size, with associated atelectasis.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2180-11-29**] 11:29 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: interval change, worsening effusion, chf and/or pna  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 66 year old woman with pna, inc SOB this am s/p volume resuscitation last night REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: interval change, worsening effusion, chf and/or pna HISTORY: Shortness of breath.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-27**], the degree of vascular congestion has substantially decreased, though there is still evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure and a large left effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 F with NASH cirrhosis, seizure dz on keppra, DVT on coumadin, chronic LE ulceration now with altered mental status in setting of multiple medical problems including new pneumonia and sepsis.
# Sepsis [**1-21**] wound infections vs. PNA: Transiently hypotensive responded to 1L NS in ED; elevated white count with bandemia.
# Acute oliguric on chronic renal failure: baseline 1.8 until [**10-19**], then increased to 2.3-2.5.
FENA suggested prerenal failure initially, then urine found to have muddy brown casts suggesting ATN.
# ALtered Mental Status/Delirium: Differential included hepatic encephalopathy, SBP, sepsis, seizures, keppra (in setting of ARF), cardiogenic shock.
# Right Lower Extremity Ulceration: Started on Vanc/Meropenem per vascular during last admission and legs improved rapidly.
Vascular did not think that the leg was the likely source of sepsis with no open ulcers there in the ED on this admission.
# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Pt with worsening wet cough and rales on exam after 6L positive on [**11-28**] to maintain SBP and UOP and with cold extremities concerning for cardiogenic shock picture.
# Diabetes: Long-standing, covered with insulin sliding scale.
# Anticoagulation: on coumadin for DVT, held on admission in setting of supratherapeutic INR.
# PPX: supratherapeutic INR .
# Code Status: DNR/DNI with goal of aggressive measures but no NG tube on admission, changed to CMO on [**11-29**] in the setting of new pneumonia, sepsis and acute renal failure.
Patient remained hypotensive on the evening of [**11-29**] and became bradycardic and expired on [**2180-11-30**] at 3:45PM.
