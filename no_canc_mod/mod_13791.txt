male with ESLD due to HCV/EtOH Cirrhosis now with delta MS.
Recently d/c'd on [**6-16**] after admission for hepatic encephalopathy versus opiate abuse.
No hx available at [**Hospital1 **] ed, except for abdominal pain.
Increasing tachypnea and tachycardia in ed, cxr with likely aspiration pna versus chf, intubated.

Repeat taps did not revealed evidence of infection.
## Resp failure: Unclear etiology, but likely aspiration event in ED.
Treated aspiration pneumonia.
Weaning and potential extubation complicated by mechanical disadvantage from large ascites as well as continued somnolence (off sedation).
we Performed  frequent large vol taps and attempted to give diuretics, but were limited by renal failure.
## Cirrhosis: End-stage cirrhosis with refractory ascites.
Patient was continued on nadolol (as bp tolerated) and lactulose) ## Renal failure: Creatinine elevation appears to be related to both elevated abdominal pressures from ascites as well as to attempts at diuresis.
## AMS: Likely hepatic encepholopathy initially, and later likely related to sedation and delayed clearance from liver disease.
Patient became increasingly hypotensive with a rising cr, eventually becoming pressor dependent.
