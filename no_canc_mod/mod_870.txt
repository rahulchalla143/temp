Admission Date:  [**2163-3-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2163-3-16**]  Date of Birth:   [**2085-7-14**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 77-year-old woman with a past medical history of rheumatic heart disease, congestive heart failure, and chronic renal failure (with one kidney) who presents from primary care physician's office with a chief complaint of dyspnea.
She was being seen for management of congestive heart failure.
She had been having increased dyspnea and orthopnea dating back to [**2162-10-29**] with worsening symptoms over the past week; increased fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, nausea, vomiting, weakness, and orthopnea.
She also reports pleuritic chest pain, decreased oral intake, and left-sided abdominal pain.
Her chest pain is both at rest and with activity.
Decreased activity capacity over approximately seven days.
She has been having worsening renal function over the past three months or so.
She also had negative creatinine kinases times three and ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
Atrial fibrillation and rheumatic heart disease (class III).
Congestive heart failure.
Diastolic function.
Mitral regurgitation (3+), mitral stenosis, and aortic regurgitation; all secondary to rheumatic heart disease.
She has had a history of basal cell carcinoma; status post resection.
ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to SULFA as well as to MOTRIN.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives at home with daughter who assists her with her medications.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   She reports increased shortness of breath, orthopnea, and chest pain times four months.
Nausea and vomiting times four weeks and diarrhea.
No fevers or chills.
She was pale and in no acute distress.
She had pale conjunctivae.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm with a III/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border and right upper sternal border.
She had a III/VI left upper sternal border systolic ejection murmur to the axilla.
She had no flank ecchymosis or tenderness.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  She had a KUB on [**2163-3-10**] which showed a small-bowel resection in the pelvis.
Small-bowel distention may indicate the presence of early obstruction given dilation down to the levels of earlier surgery.
A follow-up KUB should be obtained if symptoms persist.
Impression was no hydronephrosis.
Liver demonstrates coarse echogenicity without focal mass or hepatic ductal dilatation.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient is a 77-year-old woman with severe valvular disease, chest pain/pressure, dyspnea on exertion and at rest, fatigue, and found to be in acute renal failure, hypotensive, status post dialysis, with a persistent low blood pressure.
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  Hematocrit was down to 24.4 in the context of an elevated INR.
History of diverticulosis with a supratherapeutic INR on presentation.
The patient had a right upper quadrant ultrasound, as stated earlier above.
Iron studies were consistent with iron deficiency anemia.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  (a)  Congestive heart failure: Initially the patient had hypotesion and was not given any treatment for her congestive heart failure after the blood transfusion and improvement of the patient's blood pressure to 120 to 145/50 to 60.
The patient was initially started on nitrate for afterload reduction.
An ACE inhibitor was initially not used given the patient's elevated creatinine.
When the patient was euvolemic, her beta blocker was titrated up for rhythm control for atrial fibrillation.
The main issue and etiology of her heart failure that needed addressing was of course her rheumatic heart disease.
Repeatedly during the admission, the patient refused surgery at the current time and preferred to have medical management.
Mild thickening of the aortic valve, 1+ aortic regurgitation, 3+ mitral regurgitation, with moderate mitral stenosis, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.
No pericardial effusion.
It was very possible she could have renal vascular disease in that one kidney.
It was also possible that she had been taking a [**Doctor Last Name **]-2 inhibitor with the ACE inhibitor, and this combination was bad for her renal function, and it was eventually felt by the Renal team that this was the most likely etiology of the patient's renal failure.
Rheumatic heart disease with mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, aortic stenosis.
Congestive heart failure.
Acute renal failure.
Anemia with guaiac-positive stools with an INR of 8.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:   The patient had appointments made on [**4-4**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the Heart Failure Clinic; [**4-6**] at Adult [**Hospital **] Clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]; and on [**2163-4-13**] with General Cardiology.
PROCEDURES PERFORMED:  She had no major surgical procedures.
