HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and alcohol use who was transferred from an outside hospital with a diagnosis of pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocyst.
The patient's initial symptoms began on [**2195-5-19**] when she presented to her clinic with several days of intermittent nausea and vomiting and upper abdominal pain.
There was no fever, diarrhea, or changes in bowel habits.
She was evaluated, and on laboratories was found to have an elevation of her liver function tests.
She began to stabilize at the outside hospital until one week after admission when she developed increasing abdominal pain and found to have an increasing white blood cell count to 15,000 and an increased pancreatic enzyme level.
She obtained an abdominal CT which showed possible pancreatic pseudocyst, and she was then transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for consultation and evaluation by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1305**] in the Gold Surgery Service.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Past Medical History significant for hypertension.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Past surgical history significant for status post total abdominal hysterectomy, status post cholecystectomy, status post colonoscopy (where she was found to have a small polyp which was removed).
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
The patient was in no acute distress.
There was no lymphadenopathy.
The heart was regular in rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
She was tender in the epigastric region with no rebound and no guarding.
She had no spider angiomas.
There was no clubbing, cyanosis or edema of the extremities.
Her abdominal pain continued to resolve, and she was continued on total parenteral nutrition.
She initially tolerated this, but after one day the patient began to develop worsening abdominal pain.
She had a temperature spike to 102.1.
Laboratories were sent, and she was found to have an amylase of 277, and a lipase of 816, and her fingerstick blood sugar levels were difficult to control with an insulin sliding-scale and ranged anywhere from 250 to 350.
The patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable, but in light of what appeared to be a worsening of her pancreatitis secondary to increasing oral intake the patient was again made n.p.o.
She also underwent a CT-guided drainage of fluid found around the pancreas.
There was dye-load peripancreatic fluid collection inferior to the pancreas.
She was started on imipenem antibiotics and continued to have increasing white blood cell count and temperature and abdominal pain.
The patient had a temperature spike on hospital day seven to 103.3.
Cultures were sent, and the patient was found to have a urinary tract infection that grew enterococcus sensitive to vancomycin.
The patient's pain continued to improve, and physical examination showed markedly decreased tenderness in the epigastric region.
The patient was continued on total parenteral nutrition, and on hospital day 20 (once she had remained afebrile for several days and was stable) she was restarted on a clear diet which she tolerated.
She was weaned off her total parenteral nutrition, and she continued to be pain free and afebrile, and the patient was stable and ready for discharge to home.
Pancreatic pseudocyst.
