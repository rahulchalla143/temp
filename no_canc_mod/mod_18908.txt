He apparently had some slurred speech but was given a GCS of 15 in the ED at the OSH.
He was intubated there apparent  because of combatibe behavior and confusion.
Head CT showed a ZMC fracture on the right (zygoma, orbit and malar bones) and a minimal right frontal SAH without edema or shift.
There was no parenchymal injury by report, but we were unable to see those scans.
Past Medical History: Denies  Social History: Long history of narcotic abuse.
There was a laceration ~3cm in length beneath the right eyebrow.
A septal hematoma was not visualized.

He was found to have multiple facial fractures and a small subarachnoid hemorrage.
He had radiologic work-up that revealed: 1) [**2153-8-7**] CT head: A small amount of likely subarachnoid hemorrhage present within the right frontal lobe.
This finding was followed up with a repeat CT head scan approximately 10 hours later that showed that the bleed was stable, with no evolution.
He had no clinical neurological sign changes during his hospital course that would suggest any worsening of his intracranial bleed.
On his day of discharge, he had no focal neurological signs suggestive of evolving head bleed.
2) [**2153-8-7**] CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLA: Multiple right-sided facial fractures including comminuted fractures of the medial, inferior and lateral orbital walls.
The globe appears to be relatively intact, however there is an adjacent retrobulbar hematoma.
Comminuted fractures involving the right lateral, anterior and medial maxillary sinus wall.
Minimally displaced right nasal bone fracture.
Comminuted fracture involving the right zygomatic arch.
Both services concluded that he needed no acute intervention.
Plastic and reconstructive surgery concluded that surgical repair of his facial fractures were indicated only for cosmetic reasons and given his social issues would be better addressed at a time when his social issues are more stable.
Ophthalmology concluded that there were no acute emergent injuries to his globe or optic nerve.
3) [**2153-8-7**] CT abdomen/chest/pelvis: overall was negative for acute bleed or fracture.
