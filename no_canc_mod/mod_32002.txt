Admission Date:  [**2116-4-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-5-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2051-9-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**] Chief Complaint: STEMI, s/p PCI with RCA perforation at OSH  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IABP and Swan ganz catheter placement [**4-22**] RVAD placement [**4-22**]  History of Present Illness: 64 M with htn and hyperlipidemia admitted to OSH for elective R knee replacement.
Post-operatively, he developed symtpoms of indigestion and chest pain with STE's in the inferior leads.
Apparently, two days prior to his surgery he reported intermittent chest pain to his wife that he minimized.
Pre-operatively, there were no EKG changes compared to prior tracings.
At OSH cath, he was found to have a right dominant system and had subtotally occluded RCA.
There was 60% mid LAD and 80-90% D1 disease; no disease in Lcx.
The procedure was complicated by a perforation and dissection of his RCA.
He also had a bradycardic arrest and needed temporary pacing.
ROS: From his wife, he had been feeling well prior to surgery: denies SOB, stable 2 pillow orthopnea, stable mild ankle edema, no PND, no claudications, no stroke, no bleeding disorder, no GI bleeding, no palpitations, no syncope.
Past Medical History: HTN Hyperchol s/p R TKR R knee and L knee meniscetomy Appendectomy ?
S1, S2, RRR, intraaortic balloon pump, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
The interatrial septum is dynamic and bows into the left atrium but no atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is severe hypokinesis of the basal and mid right ventricular free wall with sparing of the right ventricular apex.
With weaning of RVAD support, little if any change in right ventricular size and/or function is appreciated.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Very trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There is a left pleural effusion.
Patient was monitored by a nurse throughout the procedure Echocardiographic Measurements Results  Measurements  Normal Range Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  40% to 50%  >= 55%  Findings Patient was intubated, sedated (on Midazolam and Fentanyl drips), and paralyzed (with Cisatracurium Besylate) for the procedure.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Severe global RV free wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild (1+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Image quality was suboptimald - poor esophageal contact.
Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler but marked bowing of the intra-atrial septum leftward was noted, indicative of elevated right-sided pressure.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 50-55%) with inferior wall hypokinesis.
The right ventricular cavity appears somewhat small with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.There are simple atheroma in the thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Large pleural effusion was incidentally noted.
IMPRESSION: Low-normal LVEF with inferior hypokinesis.
Large pleural effusion.
He was initially on dopamine and neosynephrine to maintain MAPs in 50s but subsequently had increased pressor requirement, maxed out on dobutamine, dopamine, neosynephrine and levophed.
Initial CVP was high around 20 so he did not receive fluids but subsequently received 3L NS boluses due to low CVPs around [**1-10**].
He developed afib and cardioversion was attempted x 3 with 200J, 300J, then 350 J.
C-[**Doctor First Name **] was consulted and he was taken emergently to the OR for RVAD placement.
CVVH was instituted for volume management with acute renal failure.
Liver failure also noted post- RV failure.
Necrotic areas noted on left hand and left foot.Continued to require epinephrine and levophed support.
Emergent bedside bronchoscopy done on [**5-6**] for thickened bloody secretions.
His marked acidosis continued with hypotension despite maximal pressor support.
Medications on Admission: dobutamine drip dopamine drip levophed drip  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: myocardial infarction s/p intra-aortic balloon pump right heart failure s/p right ventricular assist device cardiogenic shock hypertension hyperlipidemia coronary artery disease s/p PCI of RCA right total knee replacement liver failure renal failure   Discharge Condition: death    Completed by:[**2116-5-20**
