Complained of right pleuritic chest pain since the day before.
He had some shortness of breath as well.
He was admitted to the MICU and had a chest CT that revealed a right pulmonary artery saddle embolus.
Results revealed the following: CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There are tubular shaped filling defects extending across the bifurcation of the main pulmonary arteries.
There is flow in the subsegmental pulmonary arteries but a paucity of opacification of the right lower lobe vessels.
Lung windows demonstrate a patchy area of consolidation in the posterior right lower lobe.
There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.
No axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are remarkable for two rounded low attenuation areas in the right hepatic lobe of fluid density.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Coronal and sagittal reformatted images confirm the above axial findings.
IMPRESSION: 1) Extensive bilateral pulmonary embolism involving major, lobar and segmental divisions.
2) Patchy right lower lobe consolidation.
3) Two rounded low attenuation hepatic foci of fluid density.
On HD 1 he was transferred to the SICU where  he spiked a temperature of 103.5.
Bilateral leg duplex ultrasound was done revealing old small clot in L SFV.
On HD 3 he was experiencing increaed chest pain on the left side.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality could not be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appearred structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appeared structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation was seen.
There was moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There was no pericardial effusion.Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2177-12-28**], there was no diagnostic change.
A cxr revealed no acute changes.
Zosyn and vancomycin were started for fever and IV fluid changed to D51/2NS at 75.
Urine output was good, pain was controlled with prn iv dilaudid and nebs were given.
Neurology was consulted on HD 4 for medication review for history of seizures and myoclonus.
Recommended eventual taper of dilantin with Keppra as monotherapy, but not in the acute care setting due to high risk of seizure.
A CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST was done for persistent elevated LFTs.
This revealed:  The lung base images reveal the known PE demonstrated as big filling defects within the lower lobe arteries blaterally.
There is a large consolidation within the right lower lobe, demonstrating either pneumonia or unusual infarct.
The transplanted liver demonstrates numerous low-attenuation lesions throughout both lobes of the liver, all of them small, up to 3 cm except for one in segment V of the liver, which measures 6 x 4 cm.
There is no enhancement within or around any of these lesions and there is no free air within them.
Periportal edema is demonstrated.
There is no intra- or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
No arterial supply is demonstrated within the liver and a hepatic artery is demonstrated only proximally outside the liver.
There are no enhancing lesions within the liver.
There is a trace amount of fluid around the liver.
The kidneys, adrenal glands, pancreas, and unopacified loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable.
There are multiple small lymph nodes, but no significant lymphadenopathy.
On [**3-6**] he had drainage of a right lobe bilioma and a drain was placed.
bilioma felt to be secondary to bile duct ischemia do to known hepatic artery thrombosis.
Neuorology reassessed h/o nonconvulsive seizures and myoclonus.
A cardiac cath was performed on [**3-4**] for evaluation of arterial hypertension and PE.PA mean was 22.
Insulin sliding scale with glargine was initiated.IV hydration was continued for decreased po intake and hyperglycemia.
Lung sounds remained diminished with O2 sat of 95%.
A triphasic liver CT was performed.IMPRESSION: 1) No hepatic arterial flow visible within the liver, as documented on prior imaging studies.
2) Multiple low-density areas within the liver consistent with infarct/biloma.
A drain is located within one of these collections and contains some residual contrast material, which does not appear to connect to the biliary tree.
3) Bilateral pulmonary emboli.
4) Increased consolidation at the right lung base with increase in size of right partially loculated pleural effusion.
Pneumonia should be considered.
He was afebrile and vital signs were stable.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: VNA  of [**Hospital3 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p R saddle pulmonary embolus, L pulmonary embolus s/p liver transplant Hepatic artery thrombosis Hep C Seizures Myoclonus Type 2 DM, Steroid induced   Discharge Condition: stable.
Discharge Instructions: call if any fevers, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, inability to take medications, bleeding, increased jaundice or lack of bile drainage from bile drain.
