Inferior vena caval filter 6.
Continuous bladder irrigation   History of Present Illness: HPI: 75 y.o.
on [**2187-12-7**] at 3:45 am he was transported via ambulance to [**Hospital3 **] due to increase in pain, where he was intubated due to declining respiratory status.
Thoracic CT done here shows severe kyphosis & ankylosing spondylitis with fracture through T11-12 anterior and middle columns.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 2.
Congestive heart failure 4.
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 5.
Peripheral vascular disease 6.
Hypercholesterolemia 7.
Obstructive sleep apnea  Social History: Has two drinks of whiskey daily, lives with his wife, non-[**Name2 (NI) 1818**] x 4 years.
Family History: nc  Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM: O: T:96.7  BP:161 /92 HR:96 R: 14 O2Sats 100% intubated Gen: Intubated, difficult to arouse, off Propofol x 25 minutes, opens eyes to painful stimuli HEENT: Pupils: 1mm - 0.5 bilaterally, bilateral corneal reflexes present Neck: C-collar Extrem: Severe PVD, with cellulitis, poor perfusion over fingers and toes, cyanotic fingers bilaterally Neuro: Intubated, off propofol x 25 min.
Toes downgoing bilaterally  Reflexes: Br Pa Ac Right      1  2  1 Left        1  2  1  Pertinent Results: CT T spine 1) Severe kyphosis & ankylosing spondylitis with fracture through T11-12 anterior and middle columns.
Interstitial pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusion consistent with CHF.
Calcific pleural plaques, likely related to old asbestos exposure.
Pt with CT findings compatible with "bamboo spine" likely secondary to ankylosing spondylitis with acute fracture at T11-12.
Syndesmophyte disruption along the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments with T11 inferior endplate fracture and fracture involving both inferior facet joints.
Acute lordotic angulation at T11-12 and marked widening of the disc space also was noted.
Follow up MRI revealed ankylosis of the cervical and thoracic spine.
Fracture through T11-12 disc with disruption of the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments.
Mild trauma to the interspinous region without definite evidence of disruption of the ligamentum flavum.
No intraspinal hematoma or extrinsic spinal cord compression.
No evidence of intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities.
Pt also noted to have large left-sided pleural effusion on CT of the chest.
Initially, fall was thought be related to a coronary event.
Pt was seen by cardiology, but given pt's negative CE, EKG, and echo, it was felt that the patient did not fit the profile of an acute ischemic event as the precipitant of his fall.
Pt was noted to have thick secretions requiring frequent suctioning.
Repeat chest CT on [**12-13**] demonstrated a  large simple left pleural effusion with partial loculation anteromedially, nodular pleural thickening in right hemithorax, highly suspicious for malignant mesothelioma in the setting of asbestos-related pleural plaques.
Cytology was negative for malignant cells.
Urology was briefly consulted for hematuria in setting of indwelling foley x ~7 days.
He has failed multiple attempts at extubation due to ventilatory failure and CO2 retention.
He is also at high risk for venous thrombo-embolic disease and has problems with heparinization due to hematuria.
He is therefore considered an appropriate candidate for IVC filtration.
