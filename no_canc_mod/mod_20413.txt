Bibasilar airspace opacities, which could represent aspiration or infection.
Subtentorial hemorrhage with left cerebrellar hemorrhage surrounding edema with adjacent mass effect on the 4th ventricle which is new since prior OSH CT. 2.
Layering blood within the left lateral ventricle temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] with transependymal extension.
Hyperdense focus along the periventricular region extending into the left lateral ventricle may also represent hemorrhage.
As noted above, he had undergone head CT at OSH which was reviewed by our radiologists and was negative for acute process.
Patient was then admitted to the MICU, intubated and sedated, for further workup of altered mental status and nonresponsiveness.
On the morning of the first hospital day, his pacemaker was interrogated and there was no dysrrhythmia detected.
He had EEG leads placed, and the preliminary read returned with no seizure-like activity.
The CT showed that he had suffered a large left cerebellar ischemic infarct, with surrounding edema and spread into the brainstem.
During the course of the night, the patient became apneic and required assist control ventilation.
His pupils were fixed and dilated bilaterally, suggestive of brainstem herniation.
