Admission Date:  [**2126-8-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2126-8-28**]  Date of Birth:   [**2090-6-5**]     Sex:  F  Service:  MICU HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was a 36-year-old female with past medical history significant for hepatitis B and C diagnosed in [**2126-7-15**] who was transferred from the [**Hospital6 **] for potential liver transplantation.
On [**7-29**], the patient began to experience sweats, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting and was noted to be mildly jaundiced.
She was sent to the [**Hospital6 **] Emergency Department from detoxification, afebrile and with a blood pressure of 100/60 and respiratory rate of 50s.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was done which showed a normal liver, normal bile ducts and no ascites.
She was also found to have a positive hepatitis C antibody.
The patient was also found to be hepatitis A, antibody negative.
She was transferred back to [**Hospital6 **] on [**8-12**] with the following vital signs:  She was afebrile with a pulse of 86.
She was in no apparent distress and had marked jaundice.
Her mucous membranes were moist.
She had no cervical adenopathy.
She had no jugular venous distention and she had no thyromegaly.
Her heart was regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.
Her abdomen was soft with mild right upper quadrant tenderness.
She was nondistended with good bowel sounds and no hepatosplenomegaly.
There was no clubbing or cyanosis.
Her skin exam was significant for marked jaundice, but there were no rashes and no spider angiomata that was appreciated.
We initially treated her for a Grade [**1-16**] hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose.
Regarding her risk for cerebral edema and increase in intracranial pressure, the decision was made to perform neurologic checks every two hours and to address the issue of ICP monitoring if she did develop signs of intracranial pressure, and if the decision was made to place the monitor, we would then further consider possible mannitol and intubation with hyperventilation.
For her coagulopathy, we attributed that to her liver failure.
She was continued on Vitamin K and the decision was made to transfuse her with fresh frozen plasma if she developed any evidence of active bleeding or if the decision was made to transfuse her prior to procedures.
Essentially, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was significant for a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status consistent with her hepatic encephalopathy.
During the second week of her admission, the patient had two days of significant lucidity at which time she was alert and oriented times three and was able to show some incite into the nature of her current medical status, however, the following day, she was noted to have significantly depressed mental status and was unable to follow verbal commands.
Per Liver Service, our medical management included lactulose, enemas and oral preparations through her nasogastric tube.
Additionally, from a gastrointestinal standpoint, given the fact that her course was somewhat different from typical patient's with acute hepatitis B leading to fulminate hepatic failure, we re-sent a ceruloplasmin to verify that this patient had no other underlying comorbidities that could be contributing to her liver failure.
Given the finding on physical exam, on [**8-23**], the patient was started on penicillamine and pyridoxine for possible Wilson's disease.
The Hematology Service was consulted on [**8-23**] to address the issue of elevated prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time in this patient.
There was concern about her worsening coagulopathy as she had some improvement in her mental status, yet did not seem to show any rebound in her synthetic function in her liver.
The Hematology consults felt that the patient's thrombocytopenia might be secondary to low thrombopoietin production given her liver dysfunction and also felt that there might be some underlying low grade DIC also involved, however, they agreed with our decision to not transfuse the patient with any blood products in the absence of active bleeding.
The patient passed away later in the evening with a reportedly low blood pressure secondary to hypotension and apnea leading to cardiac arrest.
