Admission Date:  [**2157-1-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2157-1-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2091-7-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**] Chief Complaint: bright red blood per rectum  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: colonoscopy  History of Present Illness: The patient is a 65 year old woman with a h/o CAD, CHF and AFib presenting with bright red blood per rectum.
She denies hematochezia, no dizziness, no vomiting.
She has had some slight abdominal pain that has been intermittent and sharp in the lower quadrants.
No fever or chest pain.
At the OSH her INR was corrected with 2U FFP and a colonoscopy was performed [**2157-1-21**] which showed blood in entire colon with diverticulosis, active bleeding from diverticular opening treated with epinephrine and endoclip.
Her Hct fell after transfusion and she was transferred here for further evaluation and treatment of her unstable lower GI bleeding   Past Medical History: 1.
Coronary Artery disease - multiple caths with stents, last cath [**2156-3-5**], s/p MI X2 2.
CHF EF 60-65%, nuclear test with small potential ischemia 3.
CVA with left upper visual field cut occurred following one of her stenting procedures.
Acid reflux 6.
Diverticular disease 7.
HTN 8.
Hyperlipidemia 9. oral cancer, resection of mass on left side of tongue   Social History: She does not smoke or drink EtOH.
Single with no children.
Neuro: CN2-12 intact, except mild upper left visual field deficit on confrontational testing.
OSH CT Abd: No retroperitoneal hemorrhage, sigmoid diverticulosis.
OSH EKG: a flutter 76, nl axis, nl intervals no ST T wave changnes.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 65 year old woman with history of CAD and Afib on coumadin transferred for treatment of an unstable GI bleed in the setting of an elevated INR to ~3.5.
The most likely source is recurrent bleeding from the diverticuli visualized on colonoscopy at the outside hospital.
Prior to transfer to our institution, her coumadin had been stopped and she had been given Vitamin K and 2U FFP to reverse her INR, however she continued to have active bleeding, was given 3U PRBCs, and was transferred here for further evaluation and possible surgical intervention.
After stabilization in the MICU, she had no futher episodes of bleeding, and following the transfusion of 2 additional units of PRBC, her HCT was 29 and slowly trended upward to 33.5 over the next 3 days.
Repeat colonoscopy revealed several diverticuli in the distal colon/sigmoid region, consistent with the previous report, but none were actively bleeding and no interventions were undertaken.
- Atrial Fibrillation.
The patient remained in atrial fibrillation during the admission with several episodes of rapid ventricular response with heart rate elevations to the 140's.
Her coumadin was held during the admission given the risk of recurrant bleeding.
Diuresis was held during most of the admission over hemodynamic concerns, however, she ultimately began to have signs of volume overload including pedal edema, pulmonary crackles, and dyspnea on exertion so her home regimen of furosemide 120 PO QD was restarted.
Medications on Admission: Medications on transfer from ICU: Zantac 50mg IV q6h Nexium 40mg IV BID Metoprolol 25mg PO BID Lasix 120mg daily Lipitor 80mg daily Fish oil 1200mg daily Tylenol prn Plavix held, ASA (held in ICU) Zofran prn  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Lower GI bleed diverticulosis blood loss anemia supra-therapeutic anticoagulation atrial fibrillation history of coronary artery diesase   Discharge Condition: stable, HR around 100 and normotensive and no longer orthostatic, Hct stable at 33.
Discharge Instructions: Please return if you experience any further blood in your bowel movements, feel lightheaded or weak, or have difficulty breathing, palpitations or chest pain.
