[**2202-4-7**] Cardiac Catheterization  History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 2916**] is a 86 year old woman with severe aortic stenosis (valve area 0.6cm, peak gradient 66mmHg) and coronary artery disease s/p CABG and recent DES to RCA, LCx w/ 80% stenosis-unable to intervene who presented with right-sided chest pressure, which is her typical anginal equivalent.
In brief, angina resolved by time she reached ED, but she had EKG with deepening ST depressions in lateral leads.
CXR showed pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions.
Past Medical History: # Coronary Artery Disease s/p 2V CABG [**2198**](SVG to LAD, SVG to Ramus), History of STEMI [**12/2198**], s/p PCI of Left Main [**12/2198**], s/p PCI/DES to RCA and LCX in [**2-/2202**] # Aortic Stenosis/Insufficiency # Atrial Fibrillation, with history of tachy-brady, s/p PPM Placement # Hypertension # Hypercholesterolemia # Mild Mitral Regurgitation # Breast Ca s/p Bilateral Mastectomies approx [**2159**], and [**2172**], XRT # Rectal Cancer s/p LAR in [**2192**] # Radiation induced L axillary sarcoma, s/p XRT and resection [**2199**] # OA # Osteoporosis # History of colon polyps- adenomas, last screened [**2200**] # s/p Right THR # s/p spinal fusion # History HIT # Acute cholecystitis s/p Lap Chol [**11/2199**]   Social History: Widowed, lives indepently in [**Location (un) **].
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
HEENT: MM slightly dry, JVP elevated to jaw.
CV: [**4-18**] late peaking harsh systolic murmur @ USB and [**2-17**] diastolic murmur.
Chest: Dullness at bases bilaterally L>R with mild crackles above, occ.
Pacer site- dressing c/d/e, no hematoma Abd: soft, moderately distended, with reproducible epigastric pain EXT: R arm 1+ pitting edema, LE with 2+ pitting edema above knees.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated an elevated right and left heart filling pressures with an RVEDP of 18 mm Hg and an LVEDP of 34 mm Hg.
Hemodynamics demonstrated a mean gradient of 17 mm Hg across the aortic valve.
Hemodynamics demonstrated equalization of the left ventricle and femoral diastolic pressures indicating significant aortic regurgitation.
A echocardiogram obtained in the cath lab demonstrated moderate - severe (3+) aortic regurgitation.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified).
There is probably moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen (Pressure half time 200 ms, holodiastolic flow reversal in the descending aorta).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no significant plaque seen bilaterally.
This is consistent with no stenosis.
[**2202-4-14**] Intraop TEE: Pre Bypass - The left atrium is dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with with focal septal hypokinesis as well as overall global hypokinesis (EF 45%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Post Bypass - A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic position with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient = 5 mmHg, peak 11 mmHg).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is a mild perivalvular leak in between the right and left coronary cusps.
No aortic dissection is seen.
POSTOP LABS:    Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 2916**] was admitted under cardiology with congestive heart failure.
She ruled out for myocardial infarction.
She was noted to have acute renal insufficiency, likely prerenal etiology for which the ACE inhibitor was discontinued.
She continued on Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation.
She experienced increasing dyspnea and oxygen requirements which prompted transfer to the CCU for initiation of Lasix drip and CPAP.
Given that she was a poor surgical candidate, it was decided to attempt aortic valvuloplasty.
Aortic valvuloplasty was aborted however secondary to hemodynamic and echocardiographic evidence of severe aortic insufficiency.
After extensive discussion with the patient and her family, it was decided to proceed high risk redo operation.
She required significant pressor support and multiple blood products.
Due to a prolonged critical condition and failure to wean from mechanical ventilation, tube feedings were initiated.
She concomitantly became oliguric despite fluid and volume resuscitation.
Due to eventual mechanical problems with CVVH, hemodialysis was temporarily required.
She gradually transitioned back to Lasix drip with adequate response, and dialysis was no longer required.
A right sided chest tube was placed on [**4-25**] for worsening right pleural effusion.
The Thoracic service was therefore consulted and performed open tracheostomy and placement of PEG tube on [**4-28**] without complication.
Following placement of tracheostomy, she went on to develop worsening lethargy, altered mental status, and a rising BUN.
Rectal tube was placed for persistent dark liquid stools.
On [**5-5**], she developed an acute abdomen for which she needed intervention by the general surgery team.
Given her current conditon and her age and fraility the family decided not to proceed with this and after a long discussion with them she was made CMO.
