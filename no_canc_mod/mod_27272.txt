TTE performed on [**7-8**]: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20 percent) secondary to akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls and severe hypokinesis of the inferior septum and lateral wall.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.

The mitral inflow is consistent with a restrictive filling pattern, a marker of severe diastolic and/or systolic dysfunction.
R upper extremity ultrasound performed on [**7-7**] at [**Location (un) **] was negative for DVT  R upper extremity ultrasound on [**7-11**] demonstrated: No evidence of DVT in the right upper extremity.
KUB on [**7-7**] at [**Location (un) **]: large amount of stool, mildly dilated small bowel loops which are nonspecific and probably due to ileus  CXR (from [**Location (un) **], [**7-7**]): limited study with possible tiny pleural effusions or pleural thickening CXR [**7-8**] demonstrated: The heart is enlarged.
No significant failure is present.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, no gross failure.
There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.IMPRESSION: New mild congestive heart failure.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is an 84 year old male with history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, biventricular dysfunction, CAD, atrial fibrillation with pacemaker, DM2 and HTN admitted for decompensated heart failure.
No intervention was performed at that time.
His current presentation did not appear consistent with ischemia.
He had elevated cardiac enzymes that peaked, but were likely not significant given his renal insufficiency.
Atrial fibrillation.
Patient has a history of afib and was thought to have an underlying atrial rhythm, so EP was consulted and his AICD/pacer was interrogated which showed Atach/Afib with multiple mode switches.
Given patient's restrictive left ventricular dysfunction it was felt that rhythm control would not provide much benefit as the atrial kick would not contribute significantly to filling.
Patient was determined to be in decompensated heart failure and was maintained on a milrinone drip, which was titrated up to 0.5 mcg/kg/hr and a lasix drip which was titrated up to 15mg/hr.
Patient remained hemodynamically stable and improved clinically with slowly decreasing edema and decreasing JVP.
If patient becomes more symptomatic with increased shortness of breath, please titrate home oxygen therapy to comfort and administer roxanol prn.
R upper extremity edema.
Though patient was grossly edematous, patient had persistent R>L upper extremity edema, which was concerning for DVT.
A repeat doppler of the RUE on [**7-11**] was negative for DVT (as above).
Care was made to avoid placement of BP cuff and RUE and the edema appeared to decrease with overall diuresis.
FEN:  Cardiac, diabetic diet.
After heavy diuresis the patient became slightly hyponatremic.
A meeting was held with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in which the family expressed a desire for no escalation in care, with continuing to manage medically to d/c to [**Hospital3 **] with hospice care.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for consipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) **] Nursing Services  Discharge Diagnosis: Congestive heart failure   Discharge Condition: Patient is saturating well on room air, with minimal extremity edema.
Discharge Instructions: You have been treated for your end-stage congestive heart failure with intravenous diuretics.
If you experience any shortness of breath please use home oxygen and take Roxanol as needed to relieve your shortness of breath.
