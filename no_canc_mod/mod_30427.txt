During this admission the patient developed acute CHF and ARF.
He was found to have severe AS and multivessel CAD and on [**2157-1-24**] he underwent an aortic valve replacement (#23mm St.[**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical) and coronary artery bypass grafting times three (Lima->LAD/SVG->OM1-OM2sequential).
Mr.[**Known lastname 33733**] was placed on stress dose steroids for his polymyalgia rheumatica and was seen in consultation by [**Last Name (un) **] for elevated blood sugars.
Coumadin and heparin were started for the mechanical aortic valve and atrial fibrillation.
[**1-30**] Mr.[**Known lastname 33733**] complained of poor visual focus in the mornings.
Neurology was also consulted and felt it was likely due to fluctuating blood sugars.
[**2-1**] a Head CTA was done which confirmed a previous ischemic event.
He also experienced diarrhea toward the end of his stay and tested positive for clostridium difficile.
