Dense bilateral opacifications likely representing pulmonary contusions as well as layering bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left  Left wrist/forearm ([**4-22**]): 1.
Minimally comminuted fractures of the distal radius and ulna.
Partially imaged comminuted minimally displaced fractures of the bases of the proximal third and fourth phalanges with likely extension into the metacarpophalangeal joints  Left ankle/knee/femur ([**4-22**]): nondisplaced medial malleolar fracture  CT CTLS spine ([**4-22**]): 1.
T6 vertebral body fracture with slight retropulsion of superior-posterior portion of T6 vertebral body; anterior longitudinal ligament disruption.
The ligamentous injury and fractures through the posterior portions of the vertebral body create effectively a three column injury.
L1 compression fracture ?old, 3.
Minimally displaced fracture of middle third of right clavicle.
Left pulmonary opacities adjacent to a moderate-sized pleural effusion are compatible with contusion or atelectasis, but are incompletely imaged on this exam and were better evaluated on prior outside study.
Multilevel degenerative changes.
Suspected intra-articular distal radial fracture.
Additional findings suggesting possible old distal radial injury as well as radiocarpal and first CMC osteoarthritis.
Possible longstanding lunate deformity.
Suspected fractures at the base of the third, fourth, and question fifth proximal phalanges  Repeat hand xray [**4-25**]: 1.
Fractures involving the base of the third and fourth middle phalanges  Left ankle xray: IMPRESSION: Non-displaced medial malleolus fracture status post fiberglass cast placement.
The following injuries were identified:  Right clavicle fracture Bilateral rib fractures Bilateral pneumothoraces Sternum fracture T6 vertebral body fracture Left distal rad/ulnar fracture s/p reduction in ED  She was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery team and transferred to the Trauma ICU for pain control and close hemodynamic monitoring.
She had good pain control with IV narcotics while in the ICU.
Her anti-epileptic medications were continued, and she did not have any seizure activity.
After transfer from the ICU to the floor she initially had pain control issues which limited her participation with therapy.
Resp: Her respiratory status was closely monitored given her multiple bilateral rib fractures.
She was initially intubated for the OR and a right chest tube was placed for management of her hemopneumothorax.
She developed a small pneumothorax after chest tube removal which was treated with high-flow oxygen.
She is currently tolerating a regular diet and voiding without difficulty.
Heme: Her hematocrit and vital signs were routinely monitored and she did not show any evidence of bleeding.
She was given heparin subcutaneously and compression boots for DVT prophylaxis.
ID: Her temperature and white count were routinely monitored and she was given appropriate pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis.
MSK: She was taken to the operating room with orthopedic spine surgery for her T6 vertebral body fracture where she underwent posterior fusion T3-T9 on HD 1.
Her left ankle fracture was managed non operatively with a short leg cast and she is touch down weight bearing on her left leg.
Her clavicle fracture was also managed non operatively and she may weight bear for functional activities such as transfers and dressing.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
As a result of this trauma you sustained multiple injuries including several bone fractures which required several operations to repair.
You also sustained a fracture of one of the spine bones and underwent an operation to fix this injury.
