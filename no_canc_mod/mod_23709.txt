Reportedly, he had had 4 episodes of liquid blood stools prior to admission at OSH, 1 in ED and 1 on arrival to the floor not quanitified in volume in OSH documentation.
W/u for BRBPR there (which was thought to be [**2-1**] diverticulosis) included sigmoidoscopy which did not identify a source of bleeding and was without colitis.
A tagged RBC scan then showed bleeding overlying the left colon either in the distal transverse colon or the distal descending colon.
At 6:15p there, pt had large bloody BM and then syncopized and was transiently hypotensive to the 80s with tachycardia although a rate was not recorded.
On arrival to the MICU, states he feels diffusely weak and nauseous but not other complaints.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p DES x2 to LAD and RCA at [**Hospital1 2025**] [**3-/2105**]- per OSH records, [**4-7**] stress with LVEF 40% and reversible refects in the inferior and apical and septal regions.
States has since had neg stress tests hypertension sigmoidoscopy [**2097**]- reportedly without diverticulosis or polyps    Social History: Lives with wife.

GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB) - A LGI source was suspected given painless, large volume, no hemodynamic compromise,  and tagged RBC scan loclalized to LLQ most likely explained by a diverticular bleed, although AVM and colon cancer are also possiblities.
Colonoscopy revealed grade 1 internal hemorrhoids, diverticulosis of sigmoid and distal descending colon, no active bleeding.
SYNCOPE - Likely related to vasovagal episode, has resolved spontaneously.
No evidence or concern for sepsis, acute MI, adrenal insufficiency, acute pulmonary embolism.
CAD ??????
no evidence for active disease.
Medications on Admission: Octreotide 50mcg daily zofran 4mg Q 6 prn Meds on hold at transfer aka all home meds: plavix 75 daily ASA 325 daily verapamil ?
Also, stop taking plavix because of the increased risk of bleeding.
Increased fiber in your diet may help prevent bleeding in the future.
