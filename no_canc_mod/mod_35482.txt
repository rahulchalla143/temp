Approximately one year ago he began having intermittent chest pain.
He describes both left and right sided pain in the subcostal region.
The pain is dull and comes and goes, usually every other day.
The pain radiates around to the back on the left side.
He denies substernal chest pain or upper back pain.
The pain is dull, persistent, does not escalate, and is not sharp.
Occasionally, mild palpitations and shortness of breath come with the episodes and resolve on their own.
He was seen by a cardiologist at [**Hospital1 **] (note in OMR) who interpreted the patient's history as having been consistent with the patient having  a coronary CTA, had the patient undergo stress testing which was negative, and recommended cardiac risk factor management.
There was not a discussion of an aneurysm at this visit per the notes.
He explains that he has a plane ticket on [**6-17**] to return to [**Country 7192**] and that he was here to be evaluated prior to that trip.
He reiterates that he did not have any worsening symptoms in the past days to weeks but that he wanted to be checked prior to leaving the United States.
