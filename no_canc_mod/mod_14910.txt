He began to experience chest pain and was given amiodarone 150mg IV X1, followed by amiodarone gtt.
He became diaphoretic and was therefore given etomidate and shocked with 200J.

Encephalomalacia of the right occipital pole with associated ex vacuo dilatation of the right lateral ventricular occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] suggestive of prior cerebral injury.
Small left pneumothorax, likely related to acute left rib fractures.
Other rib deformities are bilateral.
Bibasilar and peribronchial opacities, could be due to massive aspiration, associated with atelectasis.
Severe cardiomegaly with marked enlargement of right atrium and right ventricle in this patient with known Ebstein malformation and prior sternotomy for tricuspid plasty.
Mediastinal lipomatosis.
Venous shunt between the right and the middle hepatic veins, could be due to old Budd-Chiari disease.
Tiny filling defect in the abnormal connection could be branching vessels or thrombus, likely old.

No other change since earlier today.
No evidence of intra-abdominal fluid collection.
Basal pulmonary consolidation with small pleural effusions.
Mediastinal lipomatosis.
Right adrenal myelolipoma.
Echo with bubble study No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
The intra-atrial septum is thickened consistent with prior ASD closure surgery.
No residual atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thickness and cavity size are grossly normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta to 45cm from the incisors.
The descending aorta is relatively small, but no coarctation or dissection is seen.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No atrial septal defect by 2D or color Doppler.
Well seated tricuspid annular ring with mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Severe right ventricular cavity enlargement with depressed biventricular systolic function.
Normal left ventricular cavity size with globally depressed systolic function.
No MR evidence of prior myocardial scarring/infarction although images technically suboptimal.
Abnormal and apically displaced tricuspid valve consistent with Ebstein's anomaly.
A tricuspid annulplasty ring was present.
Moderately depressed systolic function of the functional right ventricle with RVEF at 25%.
Abnormal septal motion consistent with right ventricular pressure / volume overload.
Markedly dilated inferior vena cava and hepatic veins consistent with elevated right atrial pressure.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation through tricuspid leaflets of functional right ventricle.
Severe tricuspid regurgitation through tricuspid annulus of structural right ventricle.
No evidence of atelectasis.
Right bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular block.
There are Q waves in the inferior leads consistent with prior infarction.
There is an abnormal precordial transition consistent with possible prior anterior myocardial infarction.
Low voltage in the precordial leads.
Brief Hospital Course: 39M w/ pmh of ebstein's anomaly, s/p tricuspid valve reconstruction, right and left sided systolic congestive heart failure, presenting with unstable ventricular tachycardia, s/p resuscitation with return to sinus tachycardia, s/p intubation and extubation.
# Ventricular Tachycardia: Likely result of natural history of ebstein anomaly.
Patient then underwent EP study where they were unable to induce ventricular fibrillation so unable to ablate.
EP was unable to place an ICD during this admission given recent procedure and significant abnormal heart anatomy.
Differential includes ARDS, PNA/sepsis, shunt, and volume overload.
Improvement with nitric oxide suggested some shunt physiology, although intracardiac shunt was not evident on TEE.
Respiratory failure improved with diuresis.
Multifactorial secondary to CHF, OSA, and restrictive ventilation due to habitus.
Required mechanical ventilation from admission (intubated during V Fib arrrest in ED), and extubated on [**2151-3-16**], without difficulty.
#Hypotension (resolved): Initially secondary to VT, in addition probably contribution from sedatives, positive pressure ventilation especially in the setting of marked RV dysfunction.
Sepsis less likely at this point, given broad spectrum antibiotic coverage, negative culture data, although stil febrile.
# Fevers: Leukocytosis/fever/right lobe infiltrate- Patient felt to have likely aspiration PNA with witnessed emesis during intubation.
Femoral line was removed and sent for culture.
Given negative culture data, patient was treated for VAP and then there was concern that possible drug fever given persistant fever and no positive culture data.
# Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: Has right sided heart failure only, s/p tricuspid reconstruction and ASD repair.
Initially  held statin in the setting of worsening liver abnormalities but restarted as LFTs improved.
# Pain: has left sided chest wall pain [**3-15**] fractured ribs from resuscitation.
Patient was tapped and tap revealed WBC, Joint Fluid 300* #/uL 0 - 150 RBC, Joint Fluid [**Numeric Identifier 1871**]* #/uL 0 - 0 Polys 80* % 0 - 25 Lymphocytes 4 % 0 - 75 Monocytes 0 % 0 - 70 Macrophage 16 % 0 - 70 FEW SIDEROTIC GRANULES PRESENT Joint Crystals, Number NO[**Serial Number **].
Patient states that he is having pain in his right knee which he thinks is from his gout.
# Anemia -  patient with Cr 31 currently previous baseline 41.
Patient has not had anemia labs checked.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: One (1)  Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Ventricular fibrillation arrest .
Secondary: Ebstein's anomaly Chronic left heart failure Hyperlipidemia Hypertension Obstructive sleep apnea Gout  Discharge Condition: Good, hemodynamically stable, afebrile  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after cardiac arrest.
The arrest was most likely caused by underlying rhythm abnormalities related to your Ebstein's Anomaly.
You had fevers that resolved after extubation.
You need to follow-up in 2 weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further evaluation and possible ICD placement.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is arranging for you to have an outpatient cardionet or loop recorder at home after discharge.
If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations,  weakness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, lightheadedness, or have any other concerns please [**Name6 (MD) 138**] your MD or return to the ED.
Followup Instructions: Please call to set up a follow-up appointment within 2 weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2037**] for further evaluation for ICD and monitoring of your cardiac status.
Please call the [**Hospital **] Clinic ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 7026**] as outpatient to discuss weight loss in the case of further possible heart surgery.
