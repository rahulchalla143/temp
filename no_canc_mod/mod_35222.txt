Strength 4+/5 RUE (limited by pain secondary to right clavicle fracture).
Reflexes: B  T  Br Pa Ac Right     2+ 2+ 2+ 3+ 1+ Left      2+ 2+ 2+ 3+ 1+  Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger   Pertinent Results: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2146-5-19**] 8:53 PM  FINDINGS: There are extensive facial fractures, which will be detailed in the accompanying facial bone CT report.
The overall pattern is a central smash injury with a fracture extending over the right frontal bone.
The right side component extends through and through of the inner and outer tables of the right frontal sinus and over the roof of the right orbit.
There is a minimally depressed segment of approximately 1-2 mm of the right frontal bone.
Air is also noted ectopically located within the bilateral cavernous sinuses and in the superior sagittal sinus posteriorly.
Extensive soft tissue swelling is noted over the facial structures as anticipated.
There is subcutaneous air over the forehead with a soft tissue defect, likely laceration.
There is a small cephalohematoma right posteriorly at the vertex.
There are attenuated lenses consistent with cataracts.
Intracranially, there is a small extra-axial hematoma anterior to the right frontal lobe.
The configuration is most consistent with a subdural subtype.
No definite subarachnoid hemorrhage is identified.
The cortical sulci and subarachnoid cisterns are otherwise unremarkable.
There is no CT evidence of acute cortical stroke.
IMPRESSION: Extensive facial fractures, which will be detailed in the accompanying facial bone CT report.
There is extension of the facial fractures to involve in a depressed segment of the right frontal bone as well.
There is an associated small right subdural hematoma anterior to the right frontal lobe with no significant mass effect.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2146-5-19**] 8:53 PM  FINDINGS: Extensive facial fractures are incidentally noted and will be detailed in the facial bones CT report dictated separately.
Marginal osteophyte formation accompanies the changes at these levels with no critical canal or neural foraminal stenosis identified.
There is a comminuted fracture of the mid diaphysis of the right clavicle incompletely imaged.
Normal cervical lordosis is somewhat straightened likely due to immobilization collar.
There is pre-existing degenerative disease as detailed above.
A right clavicle fracture is incidentally noted.
There are extensive facial fractures incompletely imaged which will be detailed in the accompanying facial bone CT report.
Suggestion of some degree of impaction on both the frontal and lateral views.
Of incidental note is a short fifth metacarpal.
IMPRESSION: Distal radial fracture with avulsion of the ulnar styloid process.
Neurosurgery, Orthopedics and Plastic Surgery were consulted because of her injuries.
Orthopedics was consulted because of her right clavicle and radius fractures; these were also managed nonoperative.
Her facial lacerations and facial fractures were evaluated by Plastic Surgery.
She will likely require operative intervention of her facial fractures in the very near future; the lacerations were sutured; the sutures were removed within 4 days.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q3H (every 3 hours) as needed for breakthrough pain.
Butalbital-Acetaminophen-Caff 50-325-40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for headache.
