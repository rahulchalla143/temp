Admission Date: [**2126-9-11**]        Discharge Date: [**2126-10-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2067-1-3**]        Sex:  M  Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Rigors and fevers up to 105.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old male status post orthotopic liver transplant complicated by multiple episodes of increased LFTs secondary to common bile duct stenosis treated with stents who presented with rigors and fevers of 105.
He became hypotensive with a base deficit, decreased PCO2 and a hematocrit of 22.6.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End-stage liver disease secondary to alcohol, status post orthotopic liver transplant on [**2126-6-15**], complicated by portal vein thrombosis, status post lysis and stent placement on [**2126-6-27**], also with CBD stricture in the common bile duct with stent placement, history of portal hypertension with esophageal varices, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, GERD, anxiety and depression, and degenerative joint disease.
ALLERGIES:  Ambien, the patient gets confused and overly sedated with Ambien.
No known drug allergies otherwise.
Blood cultures from [**Hospital3 **] were positive for gram- negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci and anaerobes.
He was started on an insulin drip as well for hypoglycemia.
On retrograde cholangiogram, it was noted that the patient had irregular filling of the common bile duct.
There were multiple echogenic foci within the left lobe of the liver concerning for pneumobilia.
An abdominal scan demonstrated underperfusion of segments 2 and 3 in the left lobe of the liver with multiple fluid and gas collections, likely representing bile leak.
There was a wedge-shaped low attenuation region of the anterior right lobe suggestive of compromise of the right anterior portal vein, although the right anterior portal vein appeared patent.
There was also moderate right pleural effusion and associated right lower lobe atelectasis with a small left pleural effusion.
There was also free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis and nonspecific stranding within the mesentery.
There were no masses or thrombi noted in the left ventricle.
There was trivial mitral regurgitation and no pericardial effusion or vegetations noted.
This demonstrated tight stenosis of the proper hepatic artery just distal to the anastomosis treated with a 3 mm x 23 mm coronary stent with good post-stent result.
There was successful snare recovery of a dislodged unexpanded 3 mm x 23 mm stent from the common hepatic artery.
Blood cultures on admission grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae sensitive to imipenem, meropenem, otherwise resistant.
Repeat blood cultures on the 5th demonstrated Klebsiella pneumoniae with the same sensitivities.
Unfortunately he removed his PICC line that was placed for long-term antibiotics, as well as the 2 pigtail catheters placed in the liver bile leaks.
He underwent replacement of 2 left hepatic abscess collection drains.
Repeat blood cultures from [**9-12**] were positive for enterococcus, as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae.
He had bile cultures that grew out Clostridium.
Repeat blood cultures on the 16th demonstrated enterococcus fecalis sensitive to daptomycin, resistant to vancomycin.
Chest x-ray done on the 13th demonstrated an interval decrease in the right pleural effusion without any consolidations.
He remained on the medical surgical unit where he was evaluated by physical therapy who recommended rehab based on the slow progress of functional activities.
for low caloric intake.
Again the right pleural effusion was stable, and it was noted that he had a small amount of ascites as well.
It was noted that the patient had a 40% stenosis in the proper hepatic artery.
It was noted that there was nonvisualization of the right hepatic vein.
This demonstrated interval improvement in the arterial wave forms within the main, right, and left hepatic arteries, as well as patent portal and hepatic veins with appropriate wave forms.
There was limited evaluation of the liver parenchyma secondary to overlying bandages.
The length of course of antibiotics depends on further repeat imaging to assess the resolution of hepatic collections.
ADDENDUM Coumadin was stopped as noted on the medication list, and aspirin and Plavix were used for prophylaxis for hepatic artery stents.
