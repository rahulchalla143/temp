There is patchy opacification at the right base consistent with the clinical impression of pneumonia.
Mild prominence of the hilar regions is seen bilaterally of uncertain significance and etiology.
Brief Hospital Course: 92-y/o-man with past medical history of COPD on home O2 who presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with respiratory distress and PNA, now s/p intubation for PNA with bradycardia, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for EP evaluation.
# Respiratory Failure.
Mixed hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure given underling COPD with possible excaberation and new RML PNA.
His pneumonia was covered broadly with vancomycin, cefepime, and doxycycline (he completed an 8-day course) and he was started on a prolonged steroid taper (methylprednisolone 60 mg x6 days switched over to prednisone on hospital day 7).
He was again extubated on [**6-14**] without complication.
Patient is recommended to have wear autoset CPAP on 3L of supplemental O2 at nights  # Bradycardia.
Patient with sinus node dysfunction, pauses and some hypotension prior to transfer.
EP was consulted immediately upon transfer and did not feel there was urgent indication for pacemaker.
As patient's pneumonia and COPD were treated and improved, his sinus node dysfunction resolved and the dopamine was weaned off.
EP felt that there was no need for pacemaker implantation during this admission.
Patient is being discharged with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts cardiac monitor to evaluate for irregular rhythms or further episodes of bradycardia  # Acute Renal Failure.
This was likely prerenal azotemia and resolved with intravenous fluids.
# Hypothyroidism.
# Diabetes type II.
# Communication.
