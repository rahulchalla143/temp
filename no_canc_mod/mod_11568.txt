male with remote h/o MI, htn, pvd, s/p AAA repair and aortobypass in [**2163**] p/w acute onset of sob and hemoptysis at an OSH one day prior to admission to [**Hospital1 18**].
He reported throat tightness and half a glass of hemoptysis - thin watery but red vs blood tinged mucous which began after taking his medications.
He then developed acute shortness of breath.
No palpitations.
No leg swelling.
No rigors or recent travel.
Of note he has a h/o hemoptysis 4 years ago for which he underwent a bronchoscopy which was c/w pulmonary asbestos at [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1459**] hospital.
In the ED at OSH, afebrile but hypoxic sating 74% on NRB with RR = 38.
His Xray was thought to be c/w pulmonary edema.
He had a recent stress/echo [**1-21**] which he was unable to complete [**1-20**] leg pain but his EF was 40%.
Recent admission for CHF see PMH below.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p MI in [**2143**] s/p aortobifemoral bypass in [**2163**] anxiety disorder HTN AAA s/p repair in [**2172**] Asbestosis- worked in construction cutting marble COPD diagnosed 2 years ago after "breathing tests" and started on spiriva and advair.
H/o hemoptysis attributed to asbestosis CHF with EF =40% diagnosed 4 years ago with recent visit to hospital for CHF exacerbation 3 weeks ago after which his lasix dose was doubled.
H/o GIB 4 years ago s/p EGD and started on protonix.

Family History: nc  Physical Exam: VS T = 97.6, P = 74-78 BP = 111/58 RR  = 18-20 O2Sat = 96% on 3L GENERAL: Pleasant ederly male laying almost flat, nad HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI without nystagmus, no scleral icterus noted, dry MMM, no lesions noted in OP Neck: supple, no JVD or carotid bruits appreciated Pulmonary: Prolonged expirtory phase, decreased breath sounds, crackles at both bases b/l.
S1S2, [**2-21**] holosystolic murmur with radiation to the axilla.
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Well healed midline scar appreciated.
No DPP appreciated.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
CXR ([**2175-2-17**]) IMPRESSION: 1)  Right perihilar opacification may be due to pneumonia or right hilar mass.
2)  Abnormal descending aorta, could be aneurysmal or dissected.
3)  Mild pulmonary edema.
4)  Extensive, asbestos-related pleural plaque and calcification.
Recommend dedicated chest CTA to evaluate for aortic aneurysm and lung algorithm to further assess pleural disease and right hilar abnmormality.
Multifocal consolidative and ground-glass opacities in both lungs is concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
There are associated moderate right and small left-sided pleural effusions.
Followup imaging after resolution of the acute process is recommended to evaluate for resolution of these regions.
Extensive pleural plaques consistent with prior asbestos exposure.
Coronary artery and aortic valvular calcifications.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy.
There is mild  to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
The inferior wall apeear akinetic.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Severe ([**2-19**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe mitral regurgitation with depressed LVEF.
M with COPD, asbestosis, CAD, [**Hospital 15134**] transferred from OSH with NSTEMI and hemoptysis and b/l infiltrates RLL>LUL and RML.
His hospital course during this admission is as follows:  1 Hemoptysis and SOB and alveolar infiltrates: Because his hypoxia 74% on NRB during initial presentation on [**2175-2-16**], he was initially admitted to the MICU, and improved rapidly with Bipap.
It is unclear what is the precipitatin event ?
He had a chest CT with contrast which was negative for malignancy or aorto-esophageal fistula, but showed multifocal pneumonia.
Levoquin was started for his pneumonia on [**2175-2-16**] and needs to be continued for a 14 day course (day 1 [**2175-2-16**]).
Pulmonary was consulted at the MICU, and no urgent need for bronch given decreased hemoptysis and overall clinical stability.
2 NSTEMI/CAD: This may be demand in the setting of his PNA and hypoxemia on admission.
He was monitored on tele throughout this hospital stay, and remained CP free, and no further episodes of ischemia once on the floor.
3 CHF: Echo at the OSH showed EF = 25% on [**2-16**], but repeat Echo at the [**Hospital1 **] showed 35-40% here with severe MR with 1-2+ TR here on admission.
Patient has no clear signs of fluid overload upon admission and his O2 sat has remained stable on 3-4L NC dramatically improved from 74% on NRB at the OSH.
He remained clinically stable without evidence of fluid overload during this admission.
now in sinus rhtym with non-specific changes.
6 TCP: Ddx includes consumption,sequestration or decreased production.
7 COPD/asbestosis: continued spiriva and advair; alb nebs prn  8 PVD: ASA initially held in the unit after pt developed TCP, and baby ASA was restarted once platelet was stable on the floor  9 AAA: stable  10 macrocytic anemia: ho of GI bleed, but pt was guiac negative; folate and vit B12 was nl; DIC panel negative; he was initially on protonix, but briefly d/c'ed for 1 day due to TCP in the MICU, and we resumed his protonix once he was called out to the floor and his platelets and hct remained stable.
11 Psycho: pt appear anxious and rude at times to nurses, case manager and HO; ho of anxiety disorder, continued Xanax qhs prn (pt's outpt med)  12 Prophylaxis: SCDs, bowel regimen, PPI (briefly held); PT evaluated pt and recommended rehab  13 FEN: cardiac heart healthy diet, p.o.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: NSTEMI/CAD pneumonia Thrombocytopenia hemoptysis  Secondary diagnosis: s/p aortobifemoral bypass in [**2163**] Anxiety disorder HTN AAA s/p repair in [**2172**] Asbestosis- worked in construction cutting marble COPD diagnosed 2 years ago H/o hemoptysis attributed to asbestosis CHF with EF =40% H/o GIB 4 years ago s/p EGD and started on protonix   Discharge Condition: stable, afebrile, VSS, tolerating POs, ambulating   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for hemotysis and SOB and alveolar infiltrates.
You were found to have pneumonia which you were treated with antibiotics.
We are currently thinking that it is a combination of CHF/cardiac ischemia, pneumonia in the setting of heparin.
You need to follow up with your PCP regarding whether you have developed heparin dependent antibody which is still pending at the time of your discharge.
You also had a myocardial infarction during this admission, our cardiology team evaluated you; Given multiple risk factors thrombocytopenia and no heparin products), it was decided medical management for your cardiac disease.
If you experience any chest pain, SOB, fever, chill, dizziness, palpitation or any symptoms concerning to you, please call your PCP or call 911 immediately.
