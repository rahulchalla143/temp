Admission Date:  [**2137-8-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-8-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2063-1-31**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**] Chief Complaint: Fever/Hypoxia .
Reason for MICU transfer: Hypoxia   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 10523**] is a 74 y/o M with a h/o IPF, bullous emphysema normally on home oxygen for exercise and a recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 10525**] for pneumonia, where he was discharged on levofloxacin, cefpodoxime and flagyl and at the time of discharge had an increased oxygen requirement to 1L at rest and 3L with activity who presents from his pulmonologists office with continued fever and hypoxia.
A CXR was done that showed the known RUL PNA, and he continued to complain that he felt "hot" at night, so he was sent to the ER for further evaluation as his physician was concerned that he could have an infected bullous.
In the ER since he was desaturating with ambulation, a CTA of his chest was done that showed multiple small pulmonary emboli, worsening of the RUL pneumonia and fluid in the fluid in the right upper lobe in bullae of unclear etiology.
His labs were notable for a white count of 13.3 with 78%N, no bands.
During his ER course he continued to desaturate on 4LNC, and eventually required a NRB to keep his oxygen saturation in the 93-96% range, although he did not have any increased work of breathing or any signs of respiratory distress.
He currently feels well, denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, n/v/d, abdominal pain, orthopnea or LE edema.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.

Skin: No rashes or lesions.
Numerous seborrheic keratoses, dermal and junctional moles throughout.
MICROBIOLOGY    Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2137-8-11**]):       NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.       pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
Multiple small pulmonary emboli involving the segmental and subsegmental arteries of the right lower lobe and lobar arteries of the left lower lobe and lingula.
No evidence of right heart strain on this study.
Worsening pneumonia in the right upper lobe on a background of severe emphysema and known IPF.
Fluid within bullae in the right upper lobe is thought most likely to reflect normal sequela from pneumonia, but a necrotizing component cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 10523**] is a 74-year-old man with a history of IPF, bullous emphysema and recent admission for presumed CAP, discharged on a regimen of cefpodoxime, levofloxacin and metronidazole who now re-presents with worsening RUL pneumonia complicated by possible infected bulla and multiple small pulmonary emboli in the setting of significantly worsened hypoxemia.
#) Pneumonia and possible infected bullae: The patient was recently hospitalized for a presumed CAP but failed treatment and re-presented with worsening hypoxia, continued fever and CT findings of possible infected bullae vs. necrotizing pneumonia.
For the HCAP and infected bullous/functional lung abscess he needed coverage for MRSA, pseudomonas and bacteroides and was placed on Vancomycin, Meropenem, and levofloxacin.
Patients oxygen saturations were noted to improve, he remained afebrile with a down trending WBC; therefore, he was transferred to the floor.
Given his umimpressive history of a penicillin allergy, and his recent failure of cefpodoxime, levofloxacin, and metronidazole, the patient was switched to Augmentin 875mg PO Q8H on [**8-12**] and monitored for allergic reaction.
Additionally the patient has underlying lung disease that increases risk that bronchoscopy could result in him requiring intubation.
#) Multiple Pulmonary Emboli: Multiple PEs were seen on CTA chest, likely contributing to his significant hypoxia, but he was otherwise asymptomatic (no chest pain, tachycardia.).
#) Mild Normocytic Anemia: baseline HCT as an outpatient is in the low 40's, during his last hospital stay HCT was between 34 and 37, has remained stable since that time, likely due to the inflammation from his current illness.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # Beta-glucan and galactomannan pending at discharge - will be followed up by primary team # Outpatient work-up for elevated AST/ALT # Code: Full (confirmed with patient)   Medications on Admission: 1. pravastatin 40 mg DAILY 2. diltiazem HCl 120 mg ER DAILY 3. cefpodoxime 200 mg twice a day for 6 days.
2. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 Puffs Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for SOB, wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Pulmonary embolsim Pneumonia COPD  SECONDARY: Pulmonary fibrosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
As you know you were admitted because you were noted to have very poor oxygen saturations while at your pulmonologist's office.
A chest xray and CT both showed worsening of your pneumonia and pulmonary embolism.
