Admission Date:  [**2157-8-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2157-8-19**]   Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2132**], who presented to an outside hospital with episodes of left scapula and arm pain.
The patient reports that he has been having this pain and discomfort for approximately two days prior to admission which was worsened by exertion.
On [**8-4**] the patient had another episode of this chest pain for which he took one sublingual nitroglycerin tablet with good affect.
The patient went to the Emergency Department of an outside hospital where he had another episode of chest pain which was relieved when he was started on a nitroglycerin drip.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2132**].
In general, a 79-year-old male in no acute distress.
HEENT revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Neck had no jugular venous distention.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Pulmonary revealed right basilar crackles; the left was clear.
Extremities were warm and well perfused without cyanosis or edema.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram had normal sinus rhythm at 54 beats per minute with old Q waves in II, III, and aVF; T wave inversions in II, III, and aVF and V4 through V6.
During episodes of pain the patient had diffuse T wave changes with mild elevations in II, aVF, and III; ST depressions in aVL.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted on [**8-7**] for rule out myocardial infarction.
It was felt that his electrocardiogram changes were consistent with his prior inferoposterior/apical myocardial infarction, and that he was now presenting with a troponin-negative unstable angina.
This study demonstrated an ejection fraction of approximately 42%, moderate inferior hypokinesis with akinesis of the inferobasilar wall.
He had an 80% occlusion of the left anterior descending artery, a 100% occlusion of the left circumflex, and a 100% occlusion of the right coronary artery.
The patient had a carotid Duplex study that revealed a 40% narrowing of the right internal carotid artery, and no significant stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
The patient was noted to be atrial fibrillation on arrival with compromised hemodynamics.
The patient had reverted back into atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter with a ventricular response of 80 to 100 with occasional premature ventricular contractions.
On postoperative day three the patient remained in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate in the 70s to 90s with occasional premature ventricular contractions.
By postoperative four the patient was still in atrial fibrillation with stable hemodynamics.
He was alert and oriented times three without any confusion or hallucinations, and the patient was subsequently transferred to the floor.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.
He had mild diminished breath sounds on the right with faint crackles bilaterally.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Coronary artery disease.
