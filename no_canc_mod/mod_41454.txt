The patient was not as insulin sensitive and had a hypoglycemia episode down to 52.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Patient had a white count on admission as well as a nonproductive cough most likely secondary to bronchitis, although viral infection was a possibility.
The cough remained throughout her hospital stay and did have some relief with Codeine.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Given the patient's risk for coronary artery disease with long standing diabetes, the patient had CK and troponin drawn as possible silent MI could induce her DKA.
It is unclear what caused her troponin leak, but it is not felt to be secondary to coronary artery disease.
HEMATOLOGY:  Patient's hematocrit on admission was 42.
This was felt likely secondary to hemodilution.
Diabetic ketoacidosis.
Volume depletion.
