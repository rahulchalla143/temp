History of Present Illness: This is a 37 y/o male patient with PMH Type I DM, HTN, gastroparesis, ESRD on HD (last in [**2-7**] per patient) who presents to MICU with hypertensive urgency unable from the ED.
The patient early this morning to the ED with his usual nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and was found to be hypertensive to 256/110, HR 102, T 99.2, RR 22, 92% RA.
History is difficult to obtain from patient d/t somnolence and lack of desire to participate in interview, but per ED note he was diaphoretic and 'writing in pain', vomiting clear substance.
At that time BP was attributed to abdominal pain and inability to take PO meds d/t nausea/vomiting.
Also had labile blood sugars with repeated episodes of hypoglycemia, and [**Last Name (un) **] recommended sugars in the range of 150-200.
Upon transfer to the MICU the patient appears somewhat uncomfortable, reporting nausea and abdominal pain, but when questioned he was unable/unwilling to participate in HPI or exam d/t sleepiness.
In the MICU he became hypotensive to SBP 80s.
Cardiac and infectious sources of hypotension were considered, but cardiac enzymes were not changed from prior studies and he had no localizing signs of infection; blood cultures were sent and a ultrasound of the L arm AVF ordered to rule out abscess at the site.
He was to be called out to the medical floor on [**2186-2-26**] but became somnolent after receiving pain and anti-nausea meds, so he stayed in the ICU for closer monitoring of respiratory status, which spontaneously improved.
Blood cultures returned positive with GPC in pairs and clusters, so a TTE and surveillance cultures were ordered and vancomycin was started.
ESRD on hemodialysis started [**2-/2184**] on Tu, Th, Sat 3.
Severe autonomic dysfunction with multiple hospitalizations for hypertensive emergency, gastroparesis, and orthostatic hypotension.
History of esophageal erosion, MW tear 5.
CAD with 1-vessel disease (50% stenosis D1 in [**7-/2181**]), normal stress [**11/2182**] 6. hx of Foot Ulcer 7. h/o clot in AV graft x2 ([**Month (only) 958**] and [**2185-8-13**])  Social History: Denies alcohol or tobacco use.

# hypertensive urgency:  Upon presentation it was unclear when last time was that patient took meds, but hypertension likely d/t inability to take meds in setting of N/V.
Also contribution of autonomic dysfunction.
No evidence of active end organ damage.
carduac enzymes mildly elevated, felt [**3-17**] demand ischemia in setting of hypertensive urgency, CK and MB trended [**Last Name (un) 8636**] at time of admission to medical floor.
Pt's hypertensive urgency was resolved upon admission to the medical floor.
# bacteremia:  pt with 2/4 bottles [**Last Name (un) **] neg staph on [**2-25**] and again on [**2-26**].
PORT was felt most likely source, and pt has had at least 2 sets of +blood cultures since it was placed.
TTE was obtained which was not concerning for endocarditis.
pt without stigmata of SBE.
Pt will compelete a 2 week course of vancomycin at hemodialysis, which has been arranged by renal service.
Indication: diabetic gastropathy causing inability to toleral oral antihypertensive medication prompting repeated ED presentation for hypertensive urgency.
# n/v/abdominal pain: pt with multiple admissions with similar complaints, etiology [**3-17**] gastroparesis, improves considerably with ativan, dilaudid, reglan, pt was tolerating PO meds/diet at time of admission to medical service and was restarted on oral reglan.
pt with two episodes of hypoglycemia (FSBS 22 and 27), etiology unclear, pt followed by [**Name (NI) **], who recommend no changes to current insulin regimen.
# CAD - pt denied cp/sob throughout hospitalization.
Etiology felt most likely demand ischemia in setting of original hypertensive urgency with persistent elevation of trop [**3-17**] ESRD.
# ESRD: etiology likely [**3-17**] DM and HTN, pt tolerating HD well, and underwent dialysis without difficulty on [**3-2**].
In addition pt will be given vancomycin at dialysis x 2 week course (last day [**2186-3-14**]) given his PORT line infection.
# AV fistula: pt with h/o numerous clots in AV fistula.
