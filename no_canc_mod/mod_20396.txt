Prenatal screen revealed blood type A positive, antibody negative, group B strep status unknown, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and rapid plasma reagin nonreactive.
Mother's medical history is notable for depression.
She had a prior admission for preterm labor and received magnesium sulfate and betamethasone at that time.
Mother presented with preterm labor and premature rupture of membranes and poor biophysical profile of triplet I.
He was a preterm male in moderate respiratory distress with stable vital signs.
His heart was regular in rate and rhythm with no murmurs.
He had fair aeration of his lungs with moderate retractions.
His abdomen was soft and nondistended without hepatosplenomegaly.
CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The infant developed a murmur on day of life three and had an echocardiogram.
The echocardiogram was notable for a patent ductus arteriosus and mild mitral regurgitation.
A repeat echocardiogram on day of life eight revealed closure of the patent ductus arteriosus and trivial left peripheral pulmonic stenosis.
The infant continues to have a persistent murmur consistent with peripheral pulmonic stenosis.
He has had no episodes of supraventricular tachycardia.
The infant was started on caffeine prior to extubation, and he had intermittent episodes of apnea of bradycardia.
The infant has had no difficulty with heart rate slowing or desaturations with feeding.
The infant had initial difficulty with hyponatremia with sodium levels as low as 126 on day of life eleven, for which he was treated with sodium chloride supplements.
His sodium responded nicely, and supplements were discontinued as he increased his kilocalories and began to take primarily formula.
OPHTHALMOLOGIC ISSUES:  First eye examination was on day of life twenty nine and was notable for immature retinae in zone 2.
Most recent eye examination was on day of life forty nine (on [**2111-5-25**]) and was notable for immature retinae in zone 3.
IMMUNIZATIONS RECOMMENDED:  Synagis respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) 359**] through [**Month (only) 547**] for infants who meet any of the following three criteria:  (1) born at less than 32 weeks gestation; (2) born between 32 and 35 weeks gestation with 2 of 3 of the following: plans for day care during respiratory syncytial virus season, with a smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities, or with school-age siblings; and/or (3) with chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age, and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out of home caregivers to protect the infant.
Prematurity at 29 weeks gestational age.
Mild surfactant deficiency; respiratory distress syndrome.
Patent ductus arteriosus s/p indocin.
Sepsis ruled out.
Anemia of prematurity on iron.
Peripheral pulmonic stenosis murmur.
