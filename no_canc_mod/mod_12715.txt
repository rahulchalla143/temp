Admission Date:  [**2105-11-22**]     Discharge Date:  [**2105-11-25**]   Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old male with no prior cardiac history who described atypical neck and arm pain over the preceding two to three months prior to admission while playing golf.
He had been told by his orthopaedic surgeon that he had arthritis; however, the character of the pain changed over the past two weeks to include substernal pressure and pain with exertion which was relieved with rest.
He had electrocardiograms done, enzymes, and chest x-rays and told that his pain was likely not cardiac.
His primary care physician thought that his pain was musculoskeletal and prescribed ibuprofen.
On the night prior to admission, at around 11 p.m., the patient experienced sudden [**9-1**] to [**10-1**] substernal chest pain radiating to the arms and neck.
Not associated with any nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis.
He went to [**Hospital3 38285**] where electrocardiogram showed initially 1-mm ST elevations in II, II, and aVF and ST depressions in V1 through V3.
Subsequent electrocardiograms showed worsening ST elevations up to 2 mm to 3 mm inferiorly with reciprocal 3-mm to 4-mm ST depressions in V1 through V4.
The patient was started in a heparin drip and was pain free at the time of transfer to [**Hospital1 69**].
Anxiety/panic attacks.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:    Physical examination on admission revealed he was a very pleasant, in no acute distress.
He had no jugular venous distention.
His heart examination had a normal first heart sound and second heart sound without murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
He had no peripheral edema and 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram on admission to the Coronary Care Unit showed a sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute with a leftward axis.
Normal intervals and upward cove ST segments inferiorly with resolution of the ST elevations and only slight residual ST depressions in V3 and V4.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  (a)  Coronary artery disease:  As the patient was pain free on admission to the Coronary Care Unit, there was no indication for emergent catheterization.
Because of the patient's adverse reaction in the past to beta blockers, there was concern in initiating this medication.
There was a 90% proximal left circumflex stenosis, 70% medial left circumflex stenosis, and 70% first obtuse marginal stenosis.
There was also a long 80% medial right coronary artery lesion.
The proximal circumflex lesion was stented times two; the second stent being placed distally because of dissection.
b.i.d., at which time the patient began to develop some respiratory complaints including shortness of breath, the feeling of tightness in his chest, and a cough.
Due to the possibility that his cough could have been induced by captopril which the patient had been started on, captopril was stopped, and he was changed to an angiotensin receptor blocker (Cozaar) on which he was to be discharged.
PULMONARY SYSTEM:  On hospital day three, the patient developed respiratory complaints thought to be due to his beta blocker medications (as stated above).
The beta blocker was reversed with an albuterol inhaler, to which he responded to very well, and his symptoms resolved short of a mild dry cough; felt likely to be due to the captopril.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Acute myocardial infarction.
