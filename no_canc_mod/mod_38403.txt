Admission Date:  [**2163-8-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-8-22**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 594**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central line placement and removal   History of Present Illness: 88 yo M with prior CVA with residual aphasia and right-sided weakness, CAD, Afib, initially presenting to [**Hospital1 16961**] with right lower extremity edema.
He has had intermittent RLE edema chronically, but has been more swollen within the past few weeks.
Right lower extremity ultrasound was limited due to patient's contractures, but no obvious DVT.
The patient subsequently became tachycardic to the 100s, with SBP falling to the 90s.
A secondary peripheral IV was placed.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p MI x2 CVA x2 with residual right sided weakness and aphasia Baseline mental status: Can say "what is" but little else, cannot write.
Can interact appropriately non-verbally and answer yes/no questions CHF Hypercholesterolemia Multiple UTI's Renal failure (baseline creatinine 1.5) Afib (not on Coumadin) Depression Narcolepsy s/p pacemaker  Social History: Retired from [**Last Name (un) 91648**] sporting goods where he worked as a shipper.
HEENT: Anicteric sclerae.
Dry mucous membranes.
Diffusely tender, with no rebound or guarding.
HEENT: Anicteric sclerae.
Neck: Supple, no JVD Resp: CTA bilaterally, no murmurs/rubs/[**Last Name (un) 549**] CV: Irregularly irregular, NlS1S2, I/VI systolic murmur at apex Abd: +BS, NT/ND, no rebound or guarding.
**FINAL REPORT [**2163-8-20**]**    MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2163-8-20**]):    No MRSA isolated.
STUDIES:  [**2163-8-21**] KUB: No evidence of obstruction.
[**2163-8-20**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of mitral regurgitation.]
The right ventricle is not well visualized; RV free wall motion appears grossly preserved in limited views but intrinsic function may be depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
RLE Ultrasound [**2163-8-17**]:  Limited study as described above without DVT in the right common femoral and proximal superficial femoral vein.
The distal right superficial femoral, right popliteal, and right calf veins could not be assessed.
ECG [**2163-8-17**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Right bundle-branch block.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Low voltage in the precordial leads.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: 88 year old male with h/o CVA with severe aphasia with R-sided weakness, transferred to MICU with hypotension, treated for urosepsis with broad spectrum antibiotics.
Urosepsis / Hypotension: Patient admitted with hypotension with SBP 70s, in the setting of atrial fibrillation with RVR and with UA suggestive of UTI.
There were no other focal signs of infection.
Patient was started on vanco/cefepime for broad coverage given history of recurrent UTIs.
His urine culture grew Proteus sensitive to all cephalosporins and his antibiotics were changed to cefpodoxime for a total 10 day course.
Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  He was started on digoxin for rate control for atrial fibrillation given hypotension.
Hyperkalemia: Patient had K 7.5 on presentation without EKG changes.
Etiology thought to be [**1-26**] renal failure and baseline potassium supplementation.
It was felt that he likely has chronic venous insufficiency.
His other medications were held initially in the setting of lethargy including allopurinol, ASA, citalopram, cranberry, Os-Cal, omeprazole, tylenol, benadryl, dulcolax, imodium milk of magnesia, robitussin, vicodin.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Continue cefpodoxime x 5 more days (end date [**2163-8-27**]) - Blood cultures from admission still pending - Recommend wound care evaluation after discharge for bilateral lower extremity wounds.
12. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO every eight (8) hours as needed for fever or pain.
Benadryl Allergy 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for allergy symptoms.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 5277**] - [**Location (un) 745**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Septic shock due to urinary tract infection Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response  Secondary Diagnosis: Chronic congestive heart failure Chronic kidney disease Coronary artery disease Diabetes mellitus   Discharge Condition: Level of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with a severe infection from your urinary tract and low blood pressure.
You also had kidney failure that improved with treatment of your urinary infection.
CHANGES TO YOUR MEDICATIONS: START digoxin 0.125mg every other day START cefpodoxime 200mg twice daily for 5 more days STOP metoprolol succinate - this medication can be slowly restarted after discharge if needed for tachycardia STOP NPH insulin - can be restarted after discharge if hyperglycemia  weight increases by more than 3 lbs.
