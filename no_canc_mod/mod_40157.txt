Admission Date:  [**2161-10-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-10-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2115-3-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: Headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2161-10-27**] Conventional Cerebral Angiogram with coiling   History of Present Illness: 46 year old white male who was transferred from OSH after CTA revealed Acomm / ACA bifurcation aneurysm.
The pt is visibly uncomfortable and reports that he does have a history of headaches but this is different.
He reports that he was sitting in a car smoking marijuana 2 days ago and he had abrupt onset of a severe headache.
He rated this pain a 12 on a scale of [**12-15**].
He reports that it subsided a little and then last night he had another severe headache and then went to the OSH.
He reports history of head trauma [**2160-3-6**] with subsequent EDSI and trigger pt injections via pain management.
He was told he had lung nodules for which he had PET imaging but does not need any more imaging for 6 months.
He denies nausea vomiting potophobia phonophobia.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
As on the non-enhanced portion of that examination, the axial FLAIR sequence is entirely unremarkable, with no finding to suggest subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Similarly, the GRE sequence demonstrates no evidence of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage with a solitary 3-mm focus of "blooming" susceptibility artifact in the region of the lateral aspect of the left leaflet of the tentorium cerebelli, perhaps representing an incidental dural calcification (though difficult to confirm on the CT).
There is no focus of slow diffusion to suggest an acute ischemic event and the principal intracranial vascular flow voids are preserved (see MRA, below), including those of the dural venous sinuses.
There is no space-occupying lesion, and the sella, parasellar region and remainder of the skull base and orbits are unremarkable.
There is minor mucosal thickening involving the anterior ethmoidal air cells, bilaterally, with the included paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells, otherwise grossly clear.
Corresponding to the findings on the CTA, there is normal flow-related enhancement in the included intracranial portions of both internal carotid and proximal and middle and an anterior cerebral arteries, with normal symmetric arborization of MCA branches and no significant mural irregularity or flow-limiting stenosis.
However, there is an anomalous appearance to the anterior communicating artery complex, particularly the junction of the ACom vessel and the A1 and A2 segments of the right ACA.
The MIP reconstructions demonstrate that this lesion has a relatively long and broad neck, and its dome, a bilobed appearance.
This process is associated with a markedly hypoplastic A1 segment of the contralateral ACA, as on the CTA.
There is also likely a small, 1.5-2.0mm aneurysm originating at the junction of the left ACA and the ACom and directed anterolaterally (6:83-84).
There is normal flow-related enhancement in the distal vertebral arteries, with markedly dominant right and hypoplastic left vessel, as well as the basilar and bilateral superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral arteries robust right and diminutive left posterior communicating vessels are seen with no aneurysm larger than 3 mm involving the posterior circulation.
There is a bulbous "patulous" appearance to the basilar tip with likely small infundibula at the origins of all four of its terminal branches.
The dedicated fat-saturated sequences demonstrate no crescentic or other pathologic T1-hyperintensity associated with the cervical portions of the vertebral or carotid arteries to specifically suggest intramural hematoma related to vascular dissection.
There is only limited depiction of the aortic arch.
However, the common, internal and external carotid arteries demonstrate normal course, caliber, contour, and both flow-related and contrast enhancement from their origins to the level of the skull base, with no significant mural irregularity, flow-limiting stenosis or evidence of dissection.
Similarly, though the vertebral arterial origins are poorly demonstrated, these vessels otherwise demonstrate normal course, caliber, contour, and flow-related and contrast enhancement through the vertebrobasilar junction, with no significant mural irregularity, flow-limiting stenosis, or evidence of dissection.
No evidence of subarachnoid or other intracranial hemorrhage, or other acute intracranial process.
Markedly abnormal appearance to the anterior communicating artery complex with a large 4.5-mm bilobed saccular aneurysm with relatively long and broad neck, originating from the junction of the right ACA and the ACom vessel and directed inferiorly.
Likely very small, less than 2-mm aneurysm originating at the junction of the left ACA and the ACom vessel, directed anterolaterally.
Unremarkable cervical MRA with no evidence of vertebral or carotid dissection.
There is hyperexpansion of the lungs suggesting underlying chronic pulmonary disease.
However, no acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
He was found to have an ACOMM aneurysm with no evidence of rupture or vessel dissection.
He had significant pain issues which required high dose pain medication and continued to threaten to leave.
Chronic pain was calledto assist in his management.
He was brought down for cerebral angiogram with coiling on the 22nd.
