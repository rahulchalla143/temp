CT of abd/pelvis preliminarily showed significant wall thickening of the jejunal bowel loops, consistent with lupus vasculitis.

She was evaluated by nephrology who left recommendations for workup of her acute on chronic renal failure.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Class IV Lupus Nephritis with persistent proteinurea 3.
Possible h/o rheumatic fever (unverified and may have been diagnosed prior to lupus diagnosis) 4.
Normocytic anemia 5.
Evidence of pulmonary hypertension on echo in [**4-/2141**] (no coagulopathy identified yet in context of Lupus).

Jejunal bowel loop wall thickening likely consistent with vasculitis in the setting of lupus.
No small bowel obstruction.
Moderate right and small left pleural effusion as well as pulmonary edema.
Mild to moderate gallbladder wall edema in a non-distended gallbladder, and no other findings to suggest cholecystitis.
Cholecystitis unlikely, gallbladder wall edema may be secondary to renal, cardiac, or liver dysfunction.
RENAL U/S: Echogenic and small kidneys compatible with parenchymal renal disease.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 25 F with history of HTN, SLE c/b lupus nephritis, CKD presents with sore throat, abdominal pain, and progressive fatigue x 3 weeks with hypertension and renal failure.
# Renal failure: Patient with known renal insufficiency [**3-20**] SLE nephritis.
Renal u/s and FeNa of 11.2% consistent with parenchymal disease.
Pt was hypocalcemic and hyperphosphatemic with PTH of 528, consistent with renal failure.
Nephrology and Rheumatology consulted and both felt this was not secondary to lupus flare bit to chronic medication non-compliance.
Nonetheless, checked C3, C4, and dsDNA to rule out lupus flare and they only showed low C3 and were otherwise normal.
# Abdominal pain: Patient was complaining of epigastric pain and had positive stool guaiac on admission.
CT prelim read suggested vasculitis in jejunal loops of bowel, possibly due to SLE.
She had not seen any frank blood in stool or melena at home.
Pt was started on high dose methylprednisolone per rheum recs for treatment of suspected lupus enteritis.
Pt reported improvement in epigastric pain and repeat guaiac was negative on HD2.
GI was consulted and recommended enteroscopy which did not reveal any jejunal pathology.
# Sore throat/dark sputum: etiology uncertain.
No systemic symptoms of fever or SOB.
No evidence of infection on exam and pain resolved.
# Anemia: baseline hematocrit in the low 30s.
Noted to have possible vasculitis in her jejunal bowel loops on CT and was also having dark sputum (?hemoptysis) which could be sources of chronic blood loss.
She also has renal failure which was likely contributing to poor RBC production.
Iron studies show anemia of chronic disease.
Course complicated by lupus nephritis and recent worsening of renal function (as described above).
Rheum was consulted and recommended starting high dose methylprednisolone transitioning to prednisone with a taper, especially given the negative jejunal biopsy for any enteric vasculitis.
