There is no shift of the midline structures.
The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation of the brain parenchyma is well preserved, and there is no CT evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or acute ischemic infarct.
Mucosal thickening is involving the bilateral ethmoid and right maxillary sinus.
There is no evidence of stenosis, occlusion, aneurysm, or arteriovenous malformation.
There is no evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis or dissection.
Note is made of atelectasis involving the bilateral lung apices.
Normal CT of the head, specifically without evidence of post-traumatic hemorrhage or skull fracture.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a prominent anterior fat pad with a very small pericardial effusion.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
No acute intracranial pathology.
A small hypodense focus in the right internal capsule- uncertain chronicity.
Pansinus opacification ?
Change in position of PICC line, which may be accentuated by lordotic positioning.
Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, unchanged.
No endotracheal tube.
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary edema.
No pleural effusions.
No evidence of pneumonia.
[**2171-4-4**] MRI HEAD: FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, infarction, edema, mass or mass effect seen.
No diffusion abnormalities are seen.
There is no signal abnormality on the gradient echo images.
A small focus of T2 FLAIR hyperintensity seen in the right internal capsule extending into the corona radiata likely represents an old infarct.
There is mild mucosal thickening in the maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses as seen on the earlier CT studies.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.
He completed this but the only cause for his arrest that could be found was intoxication and possible resultant hypoxia (cardiac work-up negative).
He was treated for aspiration pneumonia with levofloxacin x 8 days when he developed a fever and cough with MSSA in the sputum.
Unfortunately, he continued to have altered mental status after completion of antibiotics and resolution of acute cardiopulmonary issues.
# Status post PEA arrest: Per the EMS report, his PEA arrest was in the setting of  being intoxicated and falling from his porch, with his head and neck becoming stuck in the fence of his front yard.
Based on history, report of 30 minutes of CPR, no strips from the event were sent with the patient and he never received any ACLS medications per the documentation.
On arrival he was started on the therapeutic hypothermia protocol for neurologic protection.
He was cooled to 32 degrees celsius for about 16 hours and rewarmed early, as he had no evidence of renal or hepatic dysfunction, negative cardiac enzymes and his echocardiogram did not have any evidence of systolic or diastolic dysfunction, which made a primary arrest event unlikely.
He was monitored on continuous EEG monitoring for over 24 hours with no evidence of seizure after rewarming and decreasing his sedation.
He was started on aspirin 81 mg daily and continued on his home simvastatin 40 mg daily for ongoing CAD and stroke risk modification.
# Respiratory failure: patient was initially intubated by EMS in the setting of a possible arrest, and initially had a P:F ratio that suggested acute lung injury, thought to be due to an aspiration event.
His oxygenation improved over the next few days, but he spiked a fever and his sputum production increased along with a worsening left basilar consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
His sputum culture grew out Staph aureus which speciated out to MSSA.
His mental status remained the biggest barrier to extubation, as he would become very agitated off sedation, so he was tried on precedex and prn haldol for agititation and his mental status became less agitated.
He does have significant neck thickness and snores when sleeping, has never had sleep apnea work-up.
# Anoxic brain injury:  When he was finally weaned off sedation and mechanical ventilation, he had altered mental status.
He was manifesting symptoms of impaired attention/concentration and was hyperarousable on exam.
Per his family, this was a very big change from baseline mental status.
He underwent an MRI which was negative for acute focal damage and his labs did not show evidence of electrolyte abnormalities, toxicities (besides alcohol), or infection.
Neurology was consulted and they felt that his symptoms were most consistent with axonal injury due to the fall and anoxic brain injury.
His family was given the contact information for Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who is a traumatic brain injury and frontal lobe disinhibition specialist.
# Rash:  pt noted to have diffuse morbilliform rash on trunk, extremities, and face.
This occured in the setting of receiving cefepime empirically for fevers (see below) and having a past history of penicillin allergy.
# Aspiration pneumonia:  Pt spiked fevers to 101 over the day of [**3-28**].
Blood, urine, sputum all sent for culture and sputum grew out Staph aureus (MSSA) as well as GNR.
Concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia vs. sinusitis given the opacifications of his sinuses on CT.
# Alcohol intoxication: he had a high level on admission (> 200) and per the family has a significant history of alcohol abuse.
He was initially on propofol which would help treat withdrawal, then was managed with ativan for agitation due to concern about alcohol withdrawal.
He did not require any medications for agitation for several days before discharge.
# Cervical spine trauma: CTA of his neck on admission had no evidence of fracture but he was maintained in a cervical collar until he was able to wake up to confirm whether or not he had any pain on examination.
# Transaminitis: very mild on admission and trended down over the next 24-48 hours, hepatitis B and C serologies were negative and it thought to be due to his alcohol abuse.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Please assist with alcohol/substance abuse counseling and detox - Consider work-up for obstructive sleep apnea and setting up CPAP.
Discharge Medications: 1. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler [**Hospital1 **]: Two (2) Puff Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for Wheezing.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to the hospital because the EMS team found you unresponsive and only barely breathing.
There was concern that your heart had stopped or you had stopped breathing so a tube was inserted into your lungs to help breathe for you and your body was cooled to try to preserve your brain function.
Unfortunately, when you woke up, you were still confused and showed signs of brain injury.
- Please take a multivitamin daily - Please take acetaminophen for pain - You may use Miralax as needed for constipation.
