He was admitted on [**2173-2-13**] with grand mal tonic-clonic seizure times six after missed doses of Dilantin.
The patient was extubated the day after admission without complication and transferred to the Medicine floor on [**2173-2-15**].
Patient also had acute renal insufficiency which had resolved by the time of transfer to the Medicine floor, but also with rhabdomyolysis with peak creatinine kinase of 31,000 on [**2173-2-16**].
At the time of transfer, the patient denied any symptoms or complaints and review of systems was negative.
Left middle cerebral artery stroke in [**2167**] with residual right hemiparesis.
Physical examination with a normal examination except notable for expressive aphasia with slurred verbalizations.
Physical examination also notable for a large 1 inch laceration in the left lateral aspect of the patient's tongue.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 49 year old gentleman with seizure disorder status post stroke in [**2167**], admitted with grand mal tonic-clonic seizure and status epilepticus which broke after the Dilantin load and Ativan.
The patient's rhabdomyolysis was likely due to his status epilepticus on admission with resulting convulsions.
Patient's liver function tests were also slightly elevated, but likely related to the rhabdo and muscle breakdown.
Seizure disorder:  The patient was without any further seizure disorder since the Emergency Room.
The patient then became hypertensive which he has been known to be for many years.
Infectious disease:  The patient was febrile in the Intensive Care Unit which may have been a stress response, but also possibly related to him being intubated.
His differential includes pneumonia pneumonitis, although there is no evidence of aspiration or process on chest x-ray.
Red urine:  The patient's red urine was likely due to myoglobinuria, hematuria from Foley trauma given the greater than 1,000 red blood cells in the urinalysis.
Anemia:  The patient's iron study was most consistent with iron deficiency.
Renal failure.
