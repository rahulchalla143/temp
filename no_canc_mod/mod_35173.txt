Repeat ECG showed resolution of ST depression with rate of 101. .
Minimally displaced fractures of the nasal bone bilaterally.
No additional evidence of fracture.
Maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinus mucosal disease.
CT head wo contrast [**12-14**] Small, focal area of mixed hypo- and hyperattenuation within the right frontal lobe adjacent to the skull, most consistent with a small hemorrhagic contusion.
No significant mass effect.
Otherwise, no evidence of acute intracranial pathology.
There is a hypertensive cardiomediastinal configuration .
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2173-12-15**] 10:08 AM IMPRESSION: No significant change since the previous study or evidence of progression of edema or worsening mass effect.
No hydrocephalus.
SHOULDER (AP, NEUTRAL & AXILLARY) TRAUMA LEFT  [**2173-12-15**] 10:25 AM IMPRESSION: No fracture or dislocation.
Degenerative change involving the acromioclavicular joint.
ECHO [**12-15**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared to tracing #3 there is no significant change.
ECG Study Date of [**2173-12-14**]  2:47:28 PM Atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 101.
Compared to tracing #1 there is improvement in the minor ST segment depressions in the inferolateral leads and the rate is slower.
ECG Study Date of [**2173-12-14**]  1:41:50 PM Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Inferolateral ST-T wave changes may be rate-related.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
There were no focal abnormalities or epileptiform features.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 4643**] is a 63 y/o male w/ prodrome, syncope, question of possible seizure, tranferred to ED found to be hypertensive, in afib w/ RVR, noted to have nasal laceration, small right frontal lobe hemorragic contusion on CT head.
Given Dilantin load, Diltiazem for rate control, w/ decision to hold on aspirin and heparin until pt develops more notable cardiac symptoms or progression of brain contusion ruled out.
#Syncope vs. Seizure: The DDx is wide but is likely syncope secondary to Afib w/ RVR as pt was found to be in this rhythm in ED.
Pt may have had convulsive syncope.
Unclear if pt did indeed have seizure.
Confusion would fit w/ post ictal state, pt did not lose control of bladder or bowel.
Cardiac arrthymia leading to syncope, very possible given pt was found to be hypokalemic and severely hypophosphotemic in ED, finding that would predispose to arrythmia.
These metabolic abnormalities by themselves could have caused the syncope.
Vasovagal or hypovolemia may have also caused event, but not as likely given history, lack of signs pointing to dehydration.
Most likely, syncope was from atrial fibrillation given he was found to be newly in afib.
Per neuro, seizure activity was likely post-syncopal seizure and will not likely recur unless he experiences another syncopal event.
He reverted to sinus rhythm with dilatiazem and atenolol.
Given he had no heart failure by ECHO and his [**Country **] score is 1, he was not anticoagulated.
#Head Trauma: Brain contusion on Head CT.  Repeat CT showed no change.
# CAD: OSH records show stress [**Doctor First Name **] protocol [**2170**], 2mm st depression at peak exercise resolving w/ recovery.
Atypical epigastric pain lasting for several minutes, occuring several hours prior to syncope.
# Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Pt noted to have Cr of 1.2 on admit, OSH labs from [**2169**] note Cr 1.1. .
# Nose laceration: sutured by plastic surgery.
He was instructed to follow up at the post-surgical plastics clinic on the Friday after discharge to evaluate fracture after swelling improves.
Shoulder xray showed no fractures/dislocations but showed degenerative changes of the AC joint.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal Syncope Post-syncopal convulsion   Discharge Condition: Good, in NSR   Discharge Instructions: You were seen at [**Hospital1 18**] after a fall with loss of consciousness.
You also had seizure activity.
A head CT showed a brain contusion, which was stable on repeat head CT.  You were found to be in a rhythm called atrial fibrillation, which reverted back to a normal rhythm.
Because you had a seizure, Massachusettes law prohibits you from driving a vehicle for at least 6 months.
You should also avoid high places, ladders, roofs, or any place that you may be seriously hurt if you had a seizure.
Please call your primary care physician or return to the emergency department if you experience shortness of breath, light headedness, loss of consciousness, chest pain, numbness/tingling/weakness in any part of your body, difficulty speaking, facial droop, headache, fever greater than 101.5 degrees F, or any other symptoms that concern you.
