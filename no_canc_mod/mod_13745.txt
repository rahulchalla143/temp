Again seen is opacity at the right lung base likely representing a combination of pleural fluid and right base collapse and/or consolidation.
There is a small left effusion, with some patchy retrocardiac density, also probably unchanged.

[**2154-12-30**]: UGI SGL CONTRAST W/ KUB: IMPRESSION: No evidence of anastomotic leak or obstruction at the gastrojejunostomy.
Pt was evaluated by anaesthesia and taken to the operating room where he underwent a Takedown fundoplication from previous Mark IV thoracotomy, Paraesophageal hernia repair, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, open, Open cholecystectomy and [**Last Name (un) **] gastrostomy tube placement.
There were no adverse events in the operating room; please see the operative note for details.
It should be noted that patient required an insulin drip intra-operatively to control persistently high blood glucose levels, which was continued in the PACU and eventually replaced on post-operative day 1 with an insulin sliding scale while on the floor at the direction of [**Last Name (un) **] who was consulted for diabetes management.
Also while in the PACU, the patient was experiencing mild chest pain.
No EKG changes were observed.
The patient denied shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, headache at this point.
A STAT CXR was ordered and revealed mild-to-moderate degree of subsegmental atelectasis at both lung bases with no evidence of pneumothorax.
Following the lasix dose, the patient was weaned from the facemask to 3L NC, however, the Chest CT revealed a right segmental pulmonary embolism.
The patient continued to deny SOB or CP and was weaned from supplemental oxygen and maintained on room air.
He remained stable on the floor until he reported severe abdominal pain, chest pain, fever and tachycardia following an episode of coughing on POD7.
An Abd/ Chest CT and UGI series was suggestive of a large collection from the distal esophagus into the upper mid abdomen containing gas bubbles and debris, compatible with an abscess, likely secondary to leak; also a small right sided pneumothorax was noted.
Neuro: The patient was initially alert and oriented post-operatively; pain was initially managed with an epidural.
On POD 2, due to findings of a right-sided pulmonary embolism requiring anticoagulation via heparing gtt, the epidural was d/c'd and PCA was started for pain control.
The chest pain the patient experienced immediately post-operatively subsided by POD 1 and did not recur until the patient required transfer to the ICU on POD7 as described above.
An EKG remained unchanged showing left bundle branch block, a troponin x 1 was negative and an ECHO revealed EF 20-25% likely related to demand ischemia per report.
Cardiology re-evaluated the patient and felt was mildly fluid overloaded but that his decompensation was related to possible anastomotic leak and was not ischemic in nature.
He remained hemodynamically stable while on the floor and remained on telemetry for monitoring.
A chest tube was placed intra-operatively due to findings of a small pneumothorax following central line placement.
On POD 13/6, the patient underwent bronchoscopy with evidence of mucus plug or excessive secretions.
He was on room air and was noted to have no desaturation on ambulation on POD 21/14.
As he was able to ambulate more and no longer experienced epsiodes of desaturation and was ambulating on room air without difficulty by POD 25/18.
His diet was progressively advanced to a stage 3 diet, which was well tolerated until the episode of coughing with severe abdominal pain (described above) occured on POD7.
A repeat Abd CT and UGI series were performed and indicative of a large collection from the distal esophagus into the upper mid abdomen most likely from an anastamotic leak at the GE anastamosis; as described above, the patient was subsequently taken back to the operating room for an abdominal washout and placement of 2 additional JP drains.
After UGI study and subsequent methylene blue test showed no evidence of leak he was started on trophic tube feeds at 10cc/hr on POD 19/12.
ID: Patient was noted to have low grade fevers in the immediate post op course and was found to have positive blood cultures, growing G+ cocci in pairs and clusters on POD [**7-23**] and was started on Vanc/Zosyn/Fluc.
There was concern for HAP but his mini BAL and sputum were negative.
Repeat blood cultures afterwards had no growth.
He had pleural fluid sampled on POD [**9-24**] that grew Veillonella species on placment of a right sided pigtail that returned 100cc of purulent drainage on insertion.
The following day his CT scan showed that he had a loculated enhancing pleural effusion.
His antibiotics were narrowed to Unasyn on POD 17/10 and remained afebrile and without a leukocytosis afterwards.
The patient subsequently remained afebrile without leukocytosis.
After the NGT was removed he had no further issues with pain in his throat.
Prophylaxis: He was maintained on subcutaneous heparin until he was found to have a pulmonary embolism as mentioned above, at which point he was transitioned to a heparin drip, with goal PTT of 60-80.
Additionally, wore pneumatic boots throughout this hospitalization.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a stage 3 diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
