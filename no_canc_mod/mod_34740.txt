Admission Date:  [**2157-12-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2157-12-4**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Nsaids  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**] Chief Complaint: Sepsis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP  History of Present Illness: This is a 86 year-old female with a history of mild CHF, diverticulitis who was transfered from OSH with cholangitis/choledocolithiasis for ERCP.
The patient reports that she has been having watery diarrhea, gas and mild abd pain for several weeks - stopped taking lasix [**1-2**] diarrhea.
However, she then underwent a abd CT scan with barium on [**2157-11-21**] and then began having diarrhea since then.
On her return home, she began to feel very weak.
In addition, she had a fever to 105, abdominal pain and vomiting x 2 and was given Unasyn and Levofloxacin.
On exam in the ED, she was well appearing, mildly diffusely tender in her abd, initially tachycardic to 155.
Mild CHF Hypothyroidism Hernia  Social History: widowed, lives with her daughter, [**Name (NI) 15310**] in [**Name (NI) 5669**], no tob/Etoh/drugs  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: On admission:  GEN: Well-appearing, well-nourished, no acute distress HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, MMM, OP Clear NECK: No JVD, carotid pulses brisk, no bruits, no cervical lymphadenopathy, trachea midline COR: RRR, 3/6 systolic ejection murmur, normal S1 S2, radial pulses +2 PULM: Lungs CTAB, no W/R/R ABD: Soft, mildly tender in RLQ w/o guarding or rebound, ND, +BS, no HSM, no masses EXT: No C/C/E, no palpable cords NEURO: alert, oriented to person, place, and time.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
No ecchymoses.
No focal hepatic lesion is identified.
There is no evidence of cholecystitis.
The right kidney measures 10.4 cm and shows mild dilatation of the collecting system and ureter  ERCP: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal Major Papilla: Normal major papilla  Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
Biliary Tree: Three stones ranging in size from 3mm to 6mm that were causing partial obstruction were seen at the lower third of the common bile duct and middle third of the common bile duct.
Occlusion cholangiogram did not show any filling defects.
No pus was seen.
(sphincterotomy, stone extraction)  Recommendations: Absence of pus and normal LFTs do not eliminate cholangitis as the cause of patients high fevers, but make it less likely.
Consider evaluation for colits given diarrhea and thickening in the sigmoid colon on CT scan.
HISTORY: 86-year-old female with recurrent diarrhea, fevers and question of colon mass seen at outside hospital.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Tiny bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis are present at the lung bases.
Left-sided pneumobilia which may relate to the patient's recent ERCP two days prior is evident.
Minimal intrahepatic biliary dilatation is present.
However, the gallbladder is not distended and no wall edema or pericholecystic fluid is seen.
The pancreatic duct is prominent at the level of the pancreatic head measuring 4 mm in diameter (2:26).
The pancreatic duct at the level of the body and tail is normal in caliber.
Mild stranding at the level of the amuplla is compatibel with recent ERCP.
Several low- attenuation foci within the left kidney are too small to characterize but likely represent simple cysts.
There is no free air within the abdomen.
Several foci of probable extraluminal air are noted along the antimesenteric border (2:58).
These may represent outpouchings of the wall and diverticula or contained perforation.
A long segment of sigmoid colonic wall irregularity, extending to the rectosigmoid junction, spans a distance of approximately 7 mm and mild surrounding inflammatory change is also evident.
No adnexal masses.
No pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes are present.
No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Long segment of lower sigmoid colonic wall irregularity and possible associated contained foci of extraluminal air.
A few sigmoid colonic diverticula are noted.
The differential diagnosis includes long segment diverticulitis with contained perforation, but given the irregular appearance of the wall of the lower sigmoid colon in particular, carcinoma must also be considered and direct visualization via endoscopy is advised.
Pneumobilia likely related to recent ERCP.
Minimal intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Mild pancreatic ductal dilatation at the level of the pancreatic head may be related to recent ERCP procedure.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Biliary Tree: Three stones ranging in size from 3mm to 6mm that were causing partial obstruction were seen at the lower third of the common bile duct and middle third of the common bile duct.
Occlusion cholangiogram did not show any filling defects.
No pus was seen.
Absence of pus and normal LFTs do not eliminate cholangitis as the cause of patients high fevers, but make it less likely.
Consider evaluation for colits given diarrhea and thickening in the sigmoid colon on CT scan.
Brief Hospital Course: MICU COURSE: 86year-old female with a history of mild CHF, diverticulitis who was transfered from OSH with cholangitis/choledocolithiasis for ERCP.
At the OSH she was febrile to 105 and CT scan there showed biliary dilation.
Here, her RUQ ultrasound also showed biliary dilation.
She underwent ERCP on [**2157-12-1**] which showed several large steons which were removed by no frank pus or other evidence of cholangitis.
Of note, she also reported having 4 weeks of intermittent watery diarrhea which is improving.
She is currently free of abdominal pain at rest, has minimal pain with palpation.
Leukocytosis, fever, Diverticulitis: with LLQ pain and copious/watery diarrhea most concerning for colitis/diverticulitis.
OSH CT consistent with colitis, but also demonstrates choledocholithiasis.
Underwent ERCP (see below) and large stone removed, but no pus.
LFTs wnl, not consistent with biliary obstruction.
CT abd/pelvis with contrast performed at [**Hospital1 18**] revealed a long segment of lower sigmoid colonic wall irregularity and possible associated contained foci of extraluminal air and a few sigmoid colonic diverticula are noted.
The differential diagnosis includes long segment diverticulitis with contained perforation, but given the irregular appearance of the wall of the lower sigmoid colon in particular, carcinoma must also be considered and direct visualization via endoscopy is advised.
The surgical service was consulted regarding the CT findings and the patient's recurrent diverticulitis and the plan was made for outpatient surgical evaluation.
The patient was discharged on a prolonged course of cipro/flagyl to continue for another 14 days after discharge (for a total of almost 21 days) given the CT findings of diverticulitis with contained perforation.
With abscence of pus or LFT abnormalities, ascending cholangitis thought to be less likely source of high fever and leukocytosis.
Given the patient's ventral hernia and prior abdominal surgery, the plan was for an outpatient elective open cholecystectomy.
Likely related to protein loss with the diarrhea.
Also has low albumin.
