HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 3142**] is a 57-year-old man who presents with known carotid disease and symptoms of worsening chest pain over the last several months.
He had his first episode of chest pain this past winter when he was laying in bed, had a pressure in the center of his chest that lasted approximately for 15 minutes before resolving on its own.
He had a second episode approximately a week later that again occurred while he was at rest, however, in the interval he was able to tolerate exercise including golfing.
His EKG showed an exercise induced left bundle branch block and when this resolved he was found to have inferolateral ST segment depressions.
He was found to have on echo, new regional wall motion abnormalities with severe hypokinesis of the anterolateral inferior and apical walls and a cardiac catheterization done on [**2159-6-14**] showed three vessel coronary disease with a 90% osteal LAD lesion, a left circumflex occlusion after OM1 which had a 50% stenosis and an RCA proximal occlusion.
His EF was found to be 44% and based on this finding, he was scheduled to have coronary artery bypass surgery.
Of note, he has also been known to have carotid disease for years, his most recent carotid ultrasound shows greater than 90% stenosis bilaterally.
He has never had any symptoms but he is now scheduled for carotid stenting with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
He denies having any claudication, orthopnea, edema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or lightheadedness.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, carotid disease.
He was extubated on the evening of his operation and had no acute events through the night.
Coronary artery disease, now status post coronary artery bypass graft.
Bilateral carotid disease, status post left internal carotid artery stent.
