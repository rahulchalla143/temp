Admission Date:  [**2192-3-13**]     Discharge Date:  [**2192-3-22**]   Service:  Neurology  REASON FOR ADMISSION/CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mr. [**Known lastname 46153**] presented with a right-sided weakness and increasing lethargy.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old male with old ischemic infarction and some residual right hemiparesis, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation (on warfarin with an INR of 2.5) who presented with increasing right-sided weakness on [**2192-3-12**].
Ischemic stroke.
Coronary artery disease.
Atrial fibrillation.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination revealed an elderly male in no acute distress.
Head and neck examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Speech was dysarthric but fluent.
Motor examination revealed no tremor.
There was a right pronator drift.
Coordination testing revealed no ataxia appreciated.
At the time of this dictation, he had mild-to-moderate upper motor neuron weakness in the right side with arm greater than leg weakness and proximal greater than distal weakness.
His bleed was reevaluated with a head computed tomography scan which revealed a left lenticular nucleus bleed which involved the left internal capsule.
Subsequent computed tomography scans have shown stable bleed without evidence of further extension or ventricular involvement or mass effect.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, he had several episodes of tachycardia followed by bradycardia, and Cardiology was consulted.
The decision was made to place a pacemaker, which he tolerated without problems.
His rhythm remained in atrial fibrillation with an AV paced rhythm.
He was found to have a left lower lobe infiltrate and was started on levofloxacin.
He also had mild pulmonary edema, and this was treated successfully with furosemide.
Given the risk of ischemic infarction from his atrial fibrillation, we have restarted his warfarin at 3 mg p.o.
At the time of this dictation, Mr. [**Known lastname 46153**] is clinically stable and appropriate for emphasis on his rehabilitation.
He continues to have right hand weakness and inability to perform fine motor skills.
Left basoganglia bleed with internal capsule involvement.
Atrial fibrillation.
Old ischemic stroke.
