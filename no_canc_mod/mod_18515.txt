[**Known lastname 20036**] started on [**2133-1-29**], when she was riding in a car as passenger and suddenly developed [**6-26**] substernal chest pain with diaphoresis.
NO SOB or palpitations.
For the next day she felt some residual pressure feeling that was constant and did not vary with activity.
She notes she has had this type of pain before when has developed afib.
Pain was never this severe and never had diaphoresis previously.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.3 110 114/86 16 99% Labs and imaging significant for CXR which showed clear lungs fields with some vascular fullness.
She feels well, and denies chest pain or discomfort, SOB, or palpitations.

Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened with miild (1+) aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No thrombus identified.
Depressed LV sytolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Normal size and orientation of the pulmonary veins without CMR evidence of anomalous pulmonary venous return or pulmonary vein stenosis.
Normal left ventricular cavity size with severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the basal to mid inferior wall and akinesis of the true apex.
Late gadolinium contrast-enhanced CMR images demonstrated patchy transmural late gadolinium hyperenhancement of the basal to mid inferior wall and true apex, sparing a small segment of the distal inferior wall.
Normal right ventricular cavity size with mild free wall hypokinesis.
The RVEF was mildly depressed at 37%.
The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta were mildly increased and normal respectively.
Mild biatrial enlargement.
A note is made of multiple T2 hyperintense lesions in the liver measuring up to 3.6 x 3.0 cm in the hepatic dome (201:15) which are incompletely characterized however most likely represent simple cysts.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 55542**] is a 62yoF with h/o PAF on coumadin, CVA, HTN, HLD, who presents with chest pain, afib with RVR, and elevated troponin.
EKG showed lateral TWI and some non-specific ST changes.
Cardiac cath on [**2-3**] showed 40% LAD disease.
Thus, likely rapid Afib was the primary problem, and this caused some degree of stress cardiomyopathy and demand ischemia.
TTE showed focal wall motion abnormality (though not congruous with LAD lesion) and new decrease in EF (45%).
No Plavix was started, but aspirin was increased to 325mg daily.
# Atrial fibrillation / sick sinus syndrome: She went in and out of rapid afib and sinus bradycardia during this admission, consistent with sick sinus syndrome.
On [**2-6**] she went for PVI, but it was complicated by oropharnygeal bleeding [**12-18**] TEE probe, and she went to the CCU.
Nodal agents were held given her tendency to be in sinus bradycardia when not in atrial fibrillation.
On [**2-8**] she had an episode of rapid Afib that responded to dronadarone and ranolazine.
# PUMP: TTE 1 year ago with normal function, now with EF 45% and wall motion abnormality.
Will need repeat TTE in future to assess myocardial recovery after this acute event.
Mild oozing was noted, and the pharynx was packed with good effect.
# Urinary tract infection: [**Month (only) 116**] have contributed to sympathetic tone and helped create afib w/ RVR.
Completed 3 day course of Macrobid, UA cleared and patient became asymptomatic.
Of note, her "GERD" [**Month (only) **] are occuring only when she is in rapid afib, so she may not have GERD but rather symptomatic arrhythmia.
# Hyperlipidemia: On simvastatin at home, changed to atorvastatin this admission.
# Osteopenia: continued calcium .
========================================= TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts monitor started prior to discharge for planned 2 week monitoring; results to be reviewed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] - ENT follow-up to assess pharyngeal healing - INR supratherapeutic during admission, warfarin dose reduced; this will require further adjustment - Dronadarone was d/c due to prolonged QTc, please continue to monitor QTc on discharge - If GERD [**Last Name (STitle) **] resolve, consider stopping PPI or switching to H2 blocker  Medications on Admission: ESOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM [NEXIUM] -  (Prescribed by Other Provider: [**Name Initial (NameIs) **]) - 40 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)
Disp:*60 Tablet Extended Release 12 hr(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate stress/tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy.
You were admitted for chest pain and atrial fibrillation.
You had a cardiac catheterization, which showed no major blockages in your heart's arteries.
We did find reduced function in your heart, likely from a rapid heart rate due to the atrial fibrillation.
You had a pulmonary vein isolation procedure, which should prevent you from going into atrial fibrillation in the future.
