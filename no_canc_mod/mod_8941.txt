Admission Date:  [**2199-11-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2199-12-11**]   Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Novocain / Ciprofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 301**] Chief Complaint: Jaundice, abdominal pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ultrasound-guided percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement   History of Present Illness: Patient is 83 year-old female transferred from [**Hospital **] hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2199-11-20**] for management of gallstone pancreatitis.
She was initially admitted to [**Hospital1 **] for an ankle fracture, for which she underwent orthopaedic surgery and an external fixation device was placed.
Post-operatively at [**Hospital1 **] she developed 3 days of epigastric pain and jaundice and was diagnosed with pancreatitis and stone in the gallbladder.
MRCP showed 1cm common bile duct and intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
ERCP was then attempted and was aborted when the patient developed tachycardia during the procedure.
Past Medical History: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, previously not anticoagulated CAD, stable angina TIA HTN Hypercholesterolemia s/p TAH/BSO s/p pinning of Right ankle  Pertinent Results: Admission labs: [**2199-11-20**] 07:14AM   ALT(SGPT)-94* AST(SGOT)-115* LD(LDH)-413* ALK PHOS-286* AMYLASE-118* TOT BILI-7.1* [**2199-11-20**] 07:14AM   LIPASE-68* [**2199-11-20**] 07:14AM   WBC-21.5* RBC-4.29 HGB-13.0 HCT-37.5 MCV-88 MCH-30.3 MCHC-34.7 RDW-16.1*  Discharge labs: ([**2199-12-11**]) INR 1.6, wbc 6.6, hct 28.6  CT [**11-29**] 1.
Edematous pancreas with peripancreatic inflammatory changes consistent with pancreatitis.
No mass is visualized in the pancreatic head or surrounding the common bile duct.
A small mass may be present but obliterated by the diffuse inflammatory changes.
The pancreas enhances homogeneously, there is no evidence of necrosis.
No biliary dilatation.
Findings consistent with hepatic cirrhosis.
Conventional hepatic vasculature.
Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
There is mild thickening of the colonic wall throughout which may be secondary to low protein state.
A peripheral opacity seen in the right upper lobe is likely related to inflammatory changes.
A nodule in the atelectatic portion of the lung would not be visualized.
Echocardiogram [**2199-12-4**] Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest c/w a small secundum atrial septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
RUQ ultrasound showed distended gall bladder with positive [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign, and the patient was diagnosed with cholecystitis as well as pancreatitis.
She was started on clears on [**11-23**] and MRCP was entertained but held given the presence of the external fixation device, as well as decreasing total bili and the recent OSH MRCP that did not reveal an obstruction.
Her LFTs seemed to reach a plateau in their decline near [**11-26**] and due to remaining above normal, and an increase in the wbc to 12, an ERCP was performed on [**11-27**] which revealed a non-dilated bile duct with a tapered stricture in the distal CBD.
CT scan was performed on [**11-29**], which did not reveal a mass or other cause of the CBD stricture.
Cardiology was consulted on [**11-29**] when the patient experienced a short episode of asymptomatic Vtach overnight and subsequent atrial fibrillation that responded to beta-blockers.
The patient was slightly fluid overloaded and did well with some mild diuresis, with no further episodes of vtach or a-fib.
She has a known diagnosis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and therefore cardiology recommended longterm anticoagulation.
Coumadin was initiated with a brief period of lovenox until she became therapeutic.
Due to persistent leakage around the cholecystostomy tube a paracentesis was performed on [**2199-12-4**] that drained several liters of clear, non-bilous ascites.
Worry for a bile leak was primary reason for the paracentesis, which revealed simple ascites, likely due to malnutrition, and bile leak was ruled out.
On [**2199-12-6**] she was noted to have several small, loose stools and a cdiff test was sent that returned positive.
She did not experience any further loose stools, and showed no other symptoms of infection.
Be alert for signs of infection, either at the drain site or in general with symptoms such as fevers or chills.
If you develop itching, yellowish color to your skin, or abdominal pain, you also must tell the doctor at the rehabilitation facility right away or go to the emergency room.
Thoracic surgery was consulted during this hospitalization for a small abnormality on a chest x-ray, of which the patient and family were made aware.
