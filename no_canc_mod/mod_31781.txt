Admission Date:  [**2105-7-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2105-7-4**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ciprofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: Anemia/Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis  History of Present Illness: 86y/o F with h/o AFIB, Lacunar CVA, s/p nephrostomy tube for nephrolithiasis, and recent ICU admission for sepsis who presents with weakness for the past few days.
She could describe no antecedent events, or etiology for her sense generalized fatigue.
She did not report any lightheadedness, dizziness, palpiations or chest pain.
Her coumadin dose was held today, and decreased yesterday.
Her HCT dropped from a baseline of 29 to 21, and her K was elevated at 5.8 in the setting of a elevated Cr of 2.8  Further imaging of the abdomen demonstrated diverticulosis, a non-obstructive stone, a pericardial effusion, and no retroperitoneal bleed.
Lumbar spinal stenosis.
Nepthrolithasis with nephrostomy tube 11.
Sepsis 12.
No EtOH, tobacco, or illicits.
Requested microphone use for communication VS: 96.6, 82, 88/63, 19, 94% HEENT: mucous membranes [**Last Name (un) **], no OP lesions, No discernable JVP at 50 degrees, neck is supple, CV: No carotid bruits.
Decreased upstroke and volume.
No hyperdynamic PMI PULM: Short shallow breaths.
ABD: BS+, soft, NTND, no masses or HSM, no flankdullness.
LIMBS: Cool extremities with 3+ LE, no tremors or clubbing SKIN: No rashes.
Two stage II decubs on posterior side.
No facial droop or smile asymmetry.
TTE [**2105-7-3**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a moderate to large sized circumferential pericardial effusion (2.5cm inferior and 2.0 cm lateral to the left ventricle, 1.5cm anterior to the right atrium and right ventricle) with eccentuated respiratory variation in transmitral Doppler E wave suggestive of impaired ventricular filling.
but no right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse (may be absent in settings of pulmonary artery hypertension).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2105-6-16**], the pericardial effusion findings are new and c/w impaired filling/early tamponade physiology .
TTE [**7-4**] 11:08am There is a large pericardial effusion.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology .
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: 86y/o F with h/o AFIB, Lacunar CVA, s/p nephrostomy tube for nephrolithiasis, and recent ICU admission for sepsis who presents with weakness for the past few days.
Pericardial effusion was incidentally found on a CT abd/pelvis.
Pt was transferred to CCU for findings suggestive of cardiac tamponade physiology on ECHO [**7-3**].
She went into resp failure and was placed on ventilatory support.
# Pericardial effusion - Echocardiography shows moderate to large pericardial effusion with impaired ventricular filling c/w early tamponade physiology.
Diff dx of pericardial effusion includes viral, neoplastic (hx of breast CA), uremic, CHF, fluid overload from renal failure.
AM of [**7-4**] echo showed increased severity of tamponade and pt appeared cold and nonperfusing.
Bedside pericardiocentesis performed with resolution of tamponade on post-pericardiocentesis ECHO.
Hypotension: Initially presented to the floor with labile blood pressures, but pressures were fluid responsive and thereafter remained stable; there was no clinical evidence suggestive of sepsis.
She was transferred to CCU for management of cardiac tamponade.
She was started on pressors, intubated and continued to be hypotensive sbp 60-100.
# Dyspnea - Unsure etiology.
Bilateral pleural effusions on CT scan and X-ray likely [**12-30**] tamponade physiology and elevated L sided pressures.
No history of asthma, COPD or CHF.
Had a previous CT stone protocol showing a non-obstructive pattern; no recent CT contrast.
Pt was admitted to CCU for management of pericardial effusion.
Pt had decreasing urine output via foley cath and on AM of [**7-4**] it was noted that she had no output overnight.
Oliguria likely [**12-30**] hypotension and lack of perfusion from cardiac tamponade.
Bilateral Pleural Effusions.
Likely due to tamponade physiology.
# Anemia: likely [**12-30**] large bleed a/w pericardial tamponade .
AFIB with h/o RVR: Coumadin and ASA were held in the setting of a bleed and the patient was rate controlled with Metoprolol 5 mg IV prn.
All antihypertensives and antiarrhythmic meds were held in the setting of shock and respiratory failure.
