The infant's course was complicated by: Prenatal diagnosis of a pelvic cyst followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37080**] at AF CC at [**Hospital1 **].
The differential diagnosis includes an enteric duplication cyst, mesenteric cyst, lymphatic malformation, bladder diverticulum.
On [**3-11**] there was new onset of dilation of some fetal bowel.
That was thought this was due to some degree of bowel obstruction/compromise secondary to the cyst.
Distended bladder present.
No signs of ascites or hydrops.
Maternal history is significant for alpha thalassemias trait and iron deficiency anemia that has required intravenous iron treatment (received IV iron every 3 weeks since [**2171-12-26**]).
Mom is GBS  positive with no maternal fever.
Normal S1, S2, 2/6 systolic murmur left sternal base.
Testis descended with bilateral hydroceles.
Infant has been on room air since birth without respiratory distress.
Cardiovascular: Soft audible murmur on exam, grade [**12-31**] with systolic murmur at the left sternal bases.
Abdominal ultrasound today on [**3-13**] revealed a right lower quadrant mesenteric fluid-filled cyst with measurements of 5 x 2.4 cm with question of bowel obstruction.
Neurology: Does not meet criteria for head ultrasound.
Ophthalmology: Infant does not meet criteria for eye exams.
Infant does not meet criteria for car seat screening at this time.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Presumed mesenteric cyst, question bowel obstruction and rule out sepsis.
