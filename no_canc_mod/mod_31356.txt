# Hypotension: No fever, leukocytosis, and elevated cardiac enzymes in setting of ARF make cardiogenic process less likely without ischemic changes on EKG.
Etiology most likely urosepsis with +UA and recently similar admission requiring ICU for Urosepsis and unresponsiveness.
Hypovolemic shock also possibility given extremely dry MM and ARF.
She was initially covered broadly with Abx vanco/zosyn, also h/o GPC on blood culture (coag neg staph, coming from NH).
She was kept on a 5 day course of Vanco for MRSA in sputum, no infiltrate on CXR.
She became Hypertensive when sedation was weaned off.
# Altered mental status: Likely toxic-metabolic due to infection, hypercarbia, and narcotic use with underlying COPD (baseline pCO2 low 50s, HCO3 30).
However, pt very lethargic with depressed MS, most likely from obtundation in setting of hypercarbia, narcotics and infection as above.
No evidence of pulm edema on CXR.
# Acute renal failure: Baseline 1.0 now with ARF, unclear etiology, NSAID related vs. hypotension/ATN, vs. rhabdo.
Her CK was never elevated significantly, she responded very well to IVF with correction of Renal failure with fluids alone.
# HTN: PT was significantly hypertensive with BP 180-210 range requiring nitro gtt for [**2-15**] while she was NPO post extubation.
