Left atrial enlargement.
Q-T interval prolongation.
ST segment elevation in leads I, aVL and V2-V6.
Delayed precordial R wave progression.
Low limb lead voltage.
Findings are consistent with acute anterolateral ischemic process.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
ST segment elevations have reappeared along with a prolonged Q-T interval.
There is now terminal T wave inversion in leads V3-V6.
INT: Anterior current of ischemic injury.
Rule out non-Q wave infarction.
Low voltage.
.....................................................  ECHO [**10-3**]: Conclusions:  EF 50% The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional  left ventricular systolic dysfunction with with distal anterior and apical hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly  thickened.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of [**2116-5-7**], segmental wall motion abnormality is new.
Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF OVERVIEW: 85 YO female with severe dementia admitted for UTI/Urosepsis and was intubated for airway protection after receiving ativan.
It was found that she had had an acute MI at admission based on enzymes, EKG, and ECHO with segmental WMA c/w infarct - she was managed medically and had been on all cardioprotective medications except a BB, which was added to her regimen prior to discharge.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:  * AMI:  She had an EKG that was initially read as consistent with anterior j-point elevation and sinus tachycardia, but the final read was acute MI.
The elevated CK was thought to be due to dehydration and subsequent muscle damage.
Adding enzymes retrospectively showed an MB elevated to 18, and troponin to >1.5.
The EKG dated [**2119-9-29**] 11pm was actually taken on [**2119-10-3**] and showed complete resolution of ST changes with ?
ECHO showed inferoapical hypokinesis that was new compared to the ECHO of [**2116**] and an EF of 50% (prior was 65%).
It was unclear if these changes were entirely due to the event at this hospitalization or whether a past silent event could have contributed to these changes.
Their questions were answered regarding the function of the heart that remained, the reason that the MI was not diagnosed initially (complicated diagnosis in the setting of sepsis), the pt's new regimen, the importance of follow-up, and the option of stress test and even elective cath in the future.
* UTI/Urosepsis: Due to the Dirty UA, High WBC count, elevated lactate (but below 4.O) and worsening mental status, patient was started on levofloxacin and to double cover gram negatives, ceftazadime (pseudomonal coverage).
Patient mental status improved (to baseline dementia) with 2 days of antibiotics, and due to low risk of pseudomonal infection, ceftazadime was d/c'ed and the patient was maintained on just IV levofloxacin.
Speciation and sensitivities pending at the time of [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] c/o.
No surveillance cultures ever grew bacteria.
She remained afebrile without hypotension, tachycardia, delerium, or other signs of infection.
Sedation was weaned, and the patient was extubated without difficluty.
On ICU day 2, patient was restarted on HTCZ and PO Verapamil and maintained her SBP > 110.
The patient had no delerium, only dementia, which was baseline per the family (though the family had difficulty admitting that she had dementia - they tended to discuss it as "age related memory problems."
* FEN- patient was profoundly hypkalemic and hypophospatemic as well as hypomagnesemic and was agressively repleted.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Gentiva/[**Location 9583**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Sepsis secondary to UTI MI HTN DM2 CAD Dementia   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile, normotensive, sugars under control.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a serious infection that started in your urinary tract and entered your bloodstream.
You had a heart attack becuase of this strain.
If you develop any new symptoms, such as light-headedness, fainting, chest pain, shortness of breath, increasing confusion, fever or chills, or other worrisome symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention.
NOTE:  Pt had an MI during sepsis and has new inferoapical WMA on echo with a decreased ef (50%).
She continues to have diastolic dysfunction.
She may need adjustment to this regimen given her new cardiac event.
