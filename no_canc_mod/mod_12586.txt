Chest pain was associated with shortness of breath and occured with mild exertion.
Then during episode of chest pain, ekg notable for ST elevations in II, III, aVF.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Coronary angiography of this co-dominant system revealed 2 vessel coronary disease and LMCA disease.
The LMCA had a 60-70% stenosis distally that was eccentric.
The LAD had a 40-50% ostial stenosis which was also eccentric and hazy.
The LCX had an 80% stenosis at its origin and a 90% OM1 stenosis.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated systemic arterial pressure with an SBP of 147 mm Hg.
Left ventriculography revealed normal left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 55-60% without focal wall motion abnormality or mitral regurgitation.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2108-3-30**] Intraop TEE: PRE-BYPASS: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Given concern for acute coronary syndrome versus vasospasm, he was started on Integrilin and Diltiazem, in addition to Heparin and Nitro.
He ruled out for myocardial infarction.
He remained pain free on intravenous therapy.
The following day, he underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed severe two vessel coronary artery disease including a 70% left main lesion - see result section for additional details.
Preoperative echocardiogram showed normal ejection fraction with only trivial mitral regurgitation - see result section for additional detail.
He completed a course of Ibuprofen for postoperative pericarditis.
