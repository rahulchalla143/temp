Admission Date:  [**2154-2-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-2-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2084-5-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Placement and removal of central line Intubation PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: HPI: 69 yo with end stage MS.
In [**12-8**], developed left arm numbness and was found to have right frontal subarachnoid hemmorhage.
On [**2154-2-1**], he was admitted to psych at outside hospital with depressed mood secondary to increased lower extremity pain.
During that admission he was transferred to ICU due to fever and hypotension.
The next day ([**2154-2-10**]), he devoloped altered mental status and presented to OSH.
Dexamethasone, Ceftriaxone, and Vancomycin were administered for suspicion of meningitis.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED he became obtunded and was intubated.
Head CT showed no change in previously documented frontal SAH.
CXR showed infiltrates suggestive of pneumonia or aspiration.
He then became hypotensive in the ED, and sepsis secondary to pneumonia or UTI was presumed.
Vancomycin and Zosyn were started for broad coverage.
Femoral line was placed after difficulty placing central line, including arterial trauma with small right neck hematoma.
Upon transfer to floor, he is alert and responds to questions appropriately, but complains of intense right leg pain which is subsequently relieved by 2mg IV Morphine.

Pertinent Results: Imaging:  [**2154-2-10**] Head CT: FINDINGS: The heterogeneous hematoma in the high right frontal lobe posteriorly appears unchanged in size and configuration with mild surrounding vasogenic edema.
Its size actually appears to have decreased slightly measuring 22 x 16 mm today as compared to 26 x 18 mm on the prior study.
Evidence of bur hole in the high right frontal region from prior brain biopsy is again note.
There are no findings to suggest new hemorrhage.
Periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity is noted diffusely, unchanged.
There are no new areas of abnormal enhancement.
Since the prior study, there has been increasing mucosal opacification particularly in the ethmoids which are nearly totally opacified, but also increased mucosal thickening within the sphenoid air cells, and near total opacification now within the maxillary sinuses.
IMPRESSION: Slightly smaller right frontal hematoma compared to previous study of [**2154-1-21**].
No abnormal enhancement.
No other areas of intracranial hemorrhage.
[**2154-2-11**] ECHO: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and apex.
No intraventricular thrombus is seen.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Mild mitral regurgitation.

He had a fever and became hypotensive, and was maintained on Levophed and Dopamine.
Upon transfer to floor, he was afebrile and alert to person and place, but not year.
Potential sources of sepsis included sacral decubitus wound (culture grew moderate enterococcus), PNA (CXR not definitive, sputum gram stain with sparse staph aureus), or UTI (cultures have only grown yeast).
Oxygen requirement in house likely from combination of volume and possible PNA.
# Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: In [**12-8**], right frontal SAH was discovered after new onset left arm weakness.
Head CT read at OSH prior to this admission describes new head bleed, however the images were reviewed at the [**Hospital1 18**] and repeat head CT showed no new bleed.
He will follow up in NSG in 1 month with a repeat head CT. .
# CAD / NSTEMI - Patient developed a cardiac enzyme leak on the day of ICU admission.
There were no EKG findings of acute ischemia.
EKG and ECHO findings seemed consistent with old inferior MI but not acute process.
Aspirin and Heparin were held due to history of intracranial hemorrhage.
Please add an ace-inhibitor in the future when blood pressure allows given he has left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
# AFib - Patient has ICD and is on Amiodarone.
# Decubitus ulcers: Small erythema noted on right heal.
Also larger pressure ulcer on sacrum.
Pressure relief bed was ordered.
His ulcer should be closely monitored at rehab to prevent progression.
# Multiple Sclerosis - Diagnosed approximately 10 years ago.
Recent history of extreme lower extremity pain and suicidality.
Brief curbside of neurology service indicated that there were no further interventions available for the patient.
# Hypothyroid - Continued synthroid.
# HTN: Antihypertensives held in setting of septic shock.
# DM: Covered with insulin sliding scale during admission and on glargine 3 units.
