CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST  HISTORY: Sudden onset of severe headache.
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute transcortical infarction.
No bony lesions are seen.
Impression: No evidence for mass or acute [**Month/Day/Year **] .
MRA CHEST  CLINICAL INDICATION: A 45-year-old man with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, DM1, hypertension, and heart failure with severe hypertension, chest pain.
Rule out aortic dissection.
The aorta is of normal caliber with no evidence of dissection, intramural hematoma, or atherosclerotic ulcer.
No intraluminal filling defects are seen.
Heart otherwise shows no gross abnormalities.
No pericardial effusion.
No pleural effusions are evident.
No abnormal marrow signal is evident.
Soft tissues show no abnormalities.
Visualized portions of the upper abdomen show no abnormalities.
No evidence of aortic dissection or acute aortic abnormalities.
HISTORY: A 45-year-old male with elevated blood pressure, headache, and vomiting.
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus,or obvious large vascular territorial infarction.
Cavum septum pellucidum et vergae is noted and unchanged.
The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear well aerated.
Moderate calcification involving the cavernous portions of the carotid arteries and the vertebral arteries, left greater than right, are evident bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
HISTORY: 45-year-old male presents with severe headache.
FINDINGS: There are scattered periventricular and T2 hyperintensities within the bihemispheric white matter.
There is extensive T2 signal abnormality throughout the pons.
There is no acute infarct.
Incidental note is made of a cavum septum pellucidum and vergae.
Minimal flow signal within the proximal V3 segment of the left vertebral artery is likely artifactual.
Scattered T2 hyperintensities throughout the bihemispheric white matter and more extensive confluent changes throughout the pons may be secondary to severe microvascular ischemic disease in this patient with a history of chronic type 1 diabetes, end-stage renal disease on [**Year (4 digits) 2286**] and poorly controlled hypertension.
No intracranial hemorrhage, vascular malformation or other acute abnormality.
Lumbar Puncture: Opening pressure was 27 cm of water [**Doctor Last Name 3271**] [**Doctor Last Name **] Virus, Qualitative Real Time PCR   EBV DNA, QL PCR         Not Detected Herpes Simplex Virus, Type 1 & 2 DNA, Real-Time PCR   HSV 1 DNA                Not Detected   HSV 2 DNA                Not Detected  Gastric Emptying Study: IMPRESSION:  Normal gastric emptying study, with no scintigraphic evidence of reflux.
Brief Hospital Course: 45 yo male h/o DMT1, ESRD, on HD, presenting with hypertensive urgency/emergency in setting of worst headache of his life.
# Headache: Given history the concern was for intracranial [**Doctor Last Name **] initially.
Head CT was without bleeding, and Head MRI/MRA/MRV was without bleeding or vascular malformation or venous thrombosis.
Since his headache persisted for four days without resolution and reported left eye blurriness, and left eye pain.
Neurology was consulted and they thought the pain may be from a migraine or a vascular phenomenon and less likely intracranial [**Doctor Last Name **].
They recommended an LP to rule out [**Doctor Last Name **] or infection given his vague symptoms.
He eventually underwent an LP under fluoroscopic guidance at interventional radiology with CSF only notable for a mildy elevated opening pressure of 27 cm H2O.
He notably had only 1 wbc, 0 rbcs, and negative culture, Cryptoccocal Ag, EBV and HSV viral PCRs.
The leading differential was vasospasm vs. migraine vs. HTN vs. ?HD related (since it was more prominent on HD days).
It was decided to discontinue his nifedipine and start verapamil, as verapamil is more vasoactive; this medication would help vasospasm, migraine, and HTN etiology.
He also had severe nausea and vomiting that was controlled with reglan, compazine, and zofran, which was also thought to help his headaches.
He was given a trial of high flow oxygen as well in case the etiology was cluster headache, but this was not successful.
He also received 4 mg IV morphine to help control his HA, but he also developed decreased RR to 8 and the same sleepiness.
Pain was re-consulted.
These medications should be re-started only if absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
# Hypertension: His hypertension was most pronounced on hemodialysis days with SBPs in the 200s frequently.
He continued to have very high blood pressures after this regimen.
He continued to have episodes of sbp to the 200s occuring after [**Hospital1 2286**] in the setting of a severe headache.
His N/V were felt to be secondary to his severe headaches.
At times, despite these medications, he continued to have nausea and vomiting.
Once this was controlled, his blood pressure and headaches, and eventually his nausea and vomiting improved.
# Cranial Nerve III Palsy: Diplopia was initially reported on [**2-11**].
On further questioning the patient reports his symptoms began on [**2-7**] after the ophtho exam.
Neuro initially evaluated and feels likely third nerve palsy from diabetes.
Optho re-consulted [**2-18**] and confirmed complete CN3 palsy as the cause of diplopia and complete ptosis of left eye.
# CKD: continued HD.
He was continued on a lidocaine patch for chronic left flank pain.
# Depression: During an episode of severe pain, the patient stated he wanted to "kill himself."
Social work actively consulted the patient and helped him deal with his many social problems.
# Low grade fever: A fever of 100.5 was noted during his hospitalization.
A chest x-ray did not show any acute finding.
He was not given antibiotics and his fevers resolved.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2857**] - [**Location (un) 1121**] - [**Location (un) 4310**]  Discharge Diagnosis: primary: Hypertensive emergency, Headache NOS secondary: ESRD, DM1   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for headache and elevated blood pressures.
A lumbar puncture was eventually performed by interventional radiology and your CSF fluid was negative for bleeding or infection.
We stopped your fiorcet as this did not appear to help your pain anymore, and gave you dilaudid for your pain.
We tried to change your pain medication to different drugs (ms contin and low dose topomax), but this made you very sleepy for several days.
You were continued on tylenol alone for pain control, and surprisingly, this alleviated your headaches.
During your hospital stay, you were briefly transferred to the intensive care unit for closer evaluation of your elevated blood pressure.
You also developed double vision which we feel is secondary to a nerve in your eye that is not working correctly caused by your diabetes.
When you came in you also had chest pain, but we do not think you had a heart attack.
You also had significant nausea and vomiting during your hospital stay.
Do not take more than 4 grams of tylenol in 24 hours  STOP: Gabapentin (this may make you sleepy)       Phoslo       Glycopyrrolate  You are to contact your primary care doctor or go to the emergency room if you experience severe headaches that are not relieved with medication, sudden loss of vision or severe eye pain, confusion, chest pain, or any other symptom that is concerning to you.
