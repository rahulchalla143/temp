Admission Date:  [**2146-3-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-3-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2082-8-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 46915**] Chief Complaint: seizure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: colonoscopy endoscopy rigid sigmoidoscopy and fecal disempaction flexible sigmoidoscopy lumbar puncture PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 7203**] is a 63 year old male who is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in behavioral neurology who was brought to the ED today from his day care center due to seizures.
His neurologic history is significant for multiple strokes with residual global aphasia and right hemiparesis since [**2127**], SAH, s/p left MCA aneurysm clipping [**2143**], seizure d/o (off AED's since [**8-23**]), and recent V-P shunt placement [**1-22**] for hydrocephalus.
This AM, while at his adult day care center, he was noted to have right arm shaking.
In the ambulance, he had another witnessed seizure, was given Valium 5mg x1, but "right sided shaking" continued so he was given another 5mg Valium without resolution of seizure activity.
On arrival to the ER, he had right sided (arm and leg) rhythmic shaking.
He was seen by the neurology ED resident after he had been medicated and there was no apparent seizure activity (though exam limited due to medication administration).
He had another episode of right arm shaking and received another 2mg Ativan in the ER.
Just prior to transport to the ICU, he had another episode of right arm shaking which resolved after a bolus of propofol was given.
He had several occasional episodes of right arm and leg shaking (rhythmic) which was sometimes associated with right facial twitching as well.
There was no head or eye deviation associated with these movements.
He was also noted to have frequent, large, loose bowel movements both in the ER and ICU.
He was treated with phenobarbital until [**8-23**] when it was discontinued due to ongoing cognitive problems and no recent seizures.
At baseline, he is completely non-verbal, though understands some simple words/directions, has a right HP, but is able to walk and do basic ADLs such as feed and dress himself.
He was initially evaluated by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in behavioral neurology for behavioral and cognitive changes over the past year that were associated with worsening gait.
Past Medical History: Strokes/SAH/Seizure d/o/Hydrocephalus (with elevated opening pressure of 28) as above s/p Left MCA aneurysm clipping [**2143**] s/p V-P shunt ([**1-22**]) CAD s/p MI CHF -EF25% HTN alchoholic hepatitis NSVT s/p ablation and pacer/ICD placement   Social History: Married, lives with his wife.
Family History: mother DM   Physical Exam: Gen: alert, pleasant HEENT: head tilt to the left, VP shunt in R frontal region CV: RRR, no murmur PULM: coarse breath sounds throughout.
Coord: no dysmetria with purposeful movements.
There appears to be interval decrease in the amount of stool in the rectum.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST [**2146-3-15**]: There is bibasilar atelectasis with tiny bilateral pleural effusions.
There is a 9 mm hypoattenuating lesion in the right lobe of the liver, as well as a smaller one in the left lobe.
There are multiple bilateral cystic lesions in the kidneys.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph adenopathy, or free air.
No free fluid is seen.
There is an air fluid level in the stomach, but the small bowel appears normal.
However, there is massive dilatation of the rectum and distal sigmoid colon, with evidence of a distal fecal impaction.
Apparent intraluminal filling defects likely represent peristalsis.
There is there is a mild focus of dilatation at the splenic flexure.
There is no bowel wall thickening or pneumatosis, and no evidence of volvulus.
There is no inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
There is massive dilatation of the rectum with fecal impaction as described above.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
Massive dilatation of the rectum and distal sigmoid colon, with distal fecal impaction, and possible pseudo-obstruction.
No evidence of volvulus.
Tiny bilateral effusions with a slight atelectasis.
Small hypoattenuating foci in the liver, which cannot be further characterized on this study but may represent cysts.
EEG [**2146-3-9**]: FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording there were frequent bursts of focal mixed frequency theta and delta slowing in the left temporal region with extension to left frontal areas.
There was no prominent assymetry through the background.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the prominent focal slowing in the left anterior quadrant.
This suggests a focal subcortical abnormality in the left hemisphere, but the recording cannot specify its nature.
There was no background voltage assymetry to suggest any  prominent effect of a subdural hematoma.
There were no epileptiform features.
There is evidence of post-surgical change with surgical clips in the region of the left middle cerebral artery.
The supratentorial ventricular system appears to have decreased in size when compared to the prior examination with ex-vacuo dilatation of the left lateral ventricle.
Areas of infarction are present in the distribution of the left middle cerebral artery, the right frontal lobe anteriorly, as well as within the white matter adjacent to the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
There is no CT evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarction.
No evidence of intraparenchymal hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.
Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
There are again noted post-surgical changes with surgical clips within the region of the left middle cerebral artery.
There is no evidence of acute territorial infarct.
No abnormal enhancement after IV contrast is seen to suggest an abscess.
There are again noted opacification of a few anterior ethmoid cells, which is unchanged when compared to prior study.
There is new thickening of the left maxillary sinus, and also thickening of bilateral frontal sinus.
IMPRESSION: 1) No CT evidence of abscess.
2) Sinus disease as described above.
CT/CTA [**2146-3-14**]: HISTORY: History of prior aneurysm with seizures.
CTA to rule out recurrent aneurysm.
FINDINGS: The noncontrast study reveals a large left temporal/parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage with mild mass effect, likely dampened by the adjacent large area of porencephaly resulting from prior infarction, noted on the previous examination of [**2146-3-10**].
There may be a tiny amount of intraventricular blood sedimenting in the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Other than the mass effect, there has been no overt change in ventricular size.
There is no shift of normally midline structures.
CONCLUSION: Interval development of large left temporal/parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY FINDINGS: The area of the previous clipping of the left middle cerebral artery trifurcation aneurysm is essentially uninterpretable due to extensive streak artifacts arising from the surgical clip.
Within this significant limitation, no overt signs for an aneurysm or area of hemodynamically significant stenosis is appreciated.
CONCLUSION: Technically limited study, as described above, with no definite sign of an aneurysm.
ADDENDUM: There may be a very small right parietal chronic subdural fluid collection that, interestingly, was difficult to appreciate on the prior head CT scan.
Also, there is a probable small chronic right frontal vertex infarction.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DVT STUDY [**2146-3-21**]: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, and saphenous veins were performed.
There is a small non-occlusive thrombus located in the right common femoral vein near the insertion of the greater saphenous vein.
There is no evidence of DVT in the left lower extremity.
IMPRESSION: Small non-occlusive thrombus in the right common femoral vein.
IMPRESSION: Patchy opacity in bilateral lower lobes, probably representing aspiration vs. aspiration pneumonia.
Seizurs on admission liekly [**12-22**] chronic infarct; infectious etiology ruled out with CSF studies (including HSV PCR), no SAH on initial CT therefore unlikely recurrence or development of new aneurysm.
Pulm: Initially intubated; extubated without complication, initial CXR without PNA; developed CHF interittently (with desaturations to mid-80's) with good response to prn lasix (20mg IV).
There seems to also be a component of obstructive sleep apnea that may be contributing to his intermittent evening 02 desaturations.
CV - intermittent CHF, pacer -ROMI with CE x 3sets -BP stable throughout hospitalization; initially manages with verapamil, but given bowel obstruction and ?
-aggressive monitoring of electrolytes given hx of arrhythmia with goal K>4.0 and MG>2.0 throuhgout hospitalization.
ID- initial CXR without evidence of PNA but during last week of hospitalization and in setting of severly distended bowel, Pt developed fever with no source on blood cx or urine cx; empirically started on Levoflox and flagyl; C diff negative x3; repeat CXR showed new infiltrate and Pt cont to be febrile therefore Pt started on Zosyn for broader coverage and defevesced for 3d prior to discharge.
-stool negative for cx, ova and parasites (since recent travel to central america), -C.diff negative x3 -UA/Ucx negative -CT with contrast showed no intracranial abscess -CXR [**3-20**] without pneumonia -[**3-16**] started on Flagyl in addition to levofloxacin in case fever [**12-22**] gut translocation - [**3-20**]: fever to 102, started Zosym for broader GI coverage, sent VRE screen which was negatvie.
GI- -[**3-15**] very distended bowel; fecal impaction of distal rectum with very large stool sitting in distal colon/rectum; general surgery placed rectal tube; NGT in place.
