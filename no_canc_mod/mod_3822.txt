Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo man with fever, mental status change, recent pneumonia p/w delirium, persistent leukocytosis, acute on chronic systolic heart failure.
Delirium is likely multifactorial- change in environment at nursing home, benzodiazepines at nursing home, and infection (suspected C. Diff).
# Altered Mental Status/Delirium-Multifactorial: Suspect [**1-4**] changes in environment, medications, and infection.
- Avoid other sedating meds (e.g., benzos) - Frequent assessment of orientation - Maintain sleep wake cycle - Foley removed; PT out-of-bed - fall precuations.
Patient remained afebrile with improved WBC since intiation of flagyl.
- c.diff culture negx1, precautions - f/u blood cultures and fever curve - Reassess for sign/symptoms of localizing infection - Culture if spikes  #Dysphagia: Given delirium and visible aspiration during ICU course, he was evaluated by the speech and swallow service on [**6-2**] (see results above).
# Pneumonia: Radiographically resolved s/p previous therapy.
- d/c vanco/zosyn as were due to stop [**6-1**] - on azithromycin, but d/cd [**6-2**] given unclear indication.
- restart coumadin if inr improved to theraputic level - guaiac all stools - serial hct and active type and screen  # Congestive Heart Failure, systolic: Not currently obviously exacerbated, unclear home regimen with many medications held in the icu given elevated lactate.
- continued spironolactone 12.5mg daily, digoxin 0.125 mg every other day, diovan 20mg daily, lasix 40mg oral daily; lasix IV prn - restarted metoprolol tartrate 25mg tid (home dose 100mg succinate daily) - monitor volume status - Sats were 98% RA on discharge, but noted with peripheral edema/neck veins flat  # Acute on Chronic renal failure: Unknown baseline creatinine but nadir in our records is 1.5, which he has returned to.
- monitor given diuresis - restarted diovan, lasix, spironolactone - renally dose medications  # CAD: The patient had no evidence of active disease.
- continued aspirin, metoprolol, diovan  # Type II diabetes melitus, uncontrolled, with neuropathy and nephropathy: Not currently on full dose of his 70/30 givne not taking po reliably, -continued the 15 units every am for now with sliding scale humalog insulin and monitor blood glucose q6  # Atrial fibrillation: Adequately rate control, with pacer, continue amiodarone, digoxin, restart metoprolol as above; held coumadin  # Depression: holding cymbalta currently, unclear if this is for neuropathy vs. mood.
