Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
Neck: Supple with indistinguishable JVP due to prominent carotid pulsation and accessory muscle use during respiration.
No thrills, lifts.
No delay in carotid upstroke.
Minimal dullness to percussion at bases.
No abdominial bruits.
Large territories of tender abdominal ecchymoses in distribution of heparin injections.
Ext: Trace edema on the left.
1+ pitting edema on the right.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Superior to the left groin is an area of redness beneath the left pannus.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %) with inferior akinesis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Critical aortic stenosis treated with balloon valvotomy 4.
Severe calcification and tortuosity of aorta.
Hypotension due to large groin bleed with likely vagal reaction superimposed successfully treated.
TTE [**2123-8-23**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.

There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior akinesis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.

There is severe mitral annular calcification.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dyspnea: Attributed to acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure in the setting of severe aortic stenosis and recent measured EF of 40-45% with inferior akinesis.
Patient had crackles [**12-27**] the way up both posterior lung fields and a radiographic appearance of pulmonary edema.
Less likely is a pneumonia developing in the setting of bronchiectasis and recent hospitalization; however, the patient was afebrile and without an elevated white count or convincing radiographic appearance of pneumonia.
Was slowly diuresed and then went to cath lab for valvuloplasty.
After sheath pulled had hypotensive episode requiring intubation and pressors.
By discharge she was no longer requiring O2 during the day and was on her home CPAP regimen at night.
CAD: Extensive history of CAD with prior CABG and cardiac catheterization with coronary intervention in [**2116**].
No documented cardiac cath since that time.
Chance that new ECHO finding of inferior akinesis at last hospitalzation could be attributed to coronary event.
Repeat cath here showed no significant disease in CABG grafts and three vessel coronary disease.
After this episode had no further events on tele.
She was transfused 2 units in setting of hypotension in CCU.
She will have follow up hcts drawn at [**Hospital1 1501**] in [**11-25**] days to ensure no further decrease.
HTN: Patient's beta blocker was decreased in setting of hypotension post-cath.
FEN: - Follow and replete electrolytes in setting of active diuresis.
- Cardiac diet.
Miconazole Nitrate 2 % Powder Sig: One (1) Appl Topical [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for intertriginous rash.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 5481**] [**Hospital1 1501**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Aortic stenosis Abdominal hematoma Hypotension Acute renal failure from heart failure Acute on chronic systolic heart failure Anemia   Discharge Condition: The patient was afebrile, hemodynamically stable, with stable hematocrit before discharge.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet Fluid Restriction: 2L  You were admitted to the hospital for worsening shortness of breath.
This was because of your thickened valve in your heart.
Your shortness of breath is better after the surgery.
