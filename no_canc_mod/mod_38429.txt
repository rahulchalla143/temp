History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 52M with hx of a duodenal perforation/bleeding ulcer ([**2164**]) requiring emergent exploratory laparotomy and duodenal repair and ligation complicated by on-table cardiac arrest who p/w duodenal ulcer bleed.

On Monday the pt had hematemesis and BM with BRBPR.
He underwent EGD showing mild erosive esophagitis, gastritis with a nonbleeding ulcer in the stomach antrum, and large duodenal bulb ulcer extending from the bulb into the apexwith a visible vessel.
Friday early morning the pt had a black tarry BM associated with lightheadedness, followed by multiple episodes of hematochezia.
His HCT was 31.7 and he was without active bleeding.
The Gi attg spoke with the [**Hospital3 3583**] GI who felt that the ulcer was too large and friable to manage endoscopically.

**FINAL REPORT [**2171-11-4**]**     MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2171-11-4**]):    No MRSA isolated.
He had an unknown ulcer operation at that time that was aborted due to on-table cardiac arrest.
At this time he p/w another major duodenal ulcer bleed.
He initially presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] about [**10-28**] with a GI bleed.
He was found to have a large duodenal ulcer with a 'visible vessel' which was injected with epi and clipped, and he was started on a PPI and sucralfate.
The patient remained stable until the morning [**11-1**] when he redeveloped a major bleed with simultaneous bright red hematemesis and hematochezia.
On [**2171-11-3**], the patient was taken to the OR for repair of duodenal ulcer.
POD 2, patient began to have flatus, pain was improved.
NGT was removed and UGI was performed that showed no leak, but poor gastric emptying.
On POD4, patient began to have worsening abdominal pain, so his diet was backed down to NPO.
His JP drain although with minimal output was kept in place due to increased pain.
CTA of the chest showed no emboli, but was consistent with pulmonary edema.
Diuresis with intermittent lasix was continued only briefly and then he was managed off lasix and his oxygen was weaned off.
He continued with bronchodilator therapy for his longstanding COPD along with the incentive spirometer and remained free of any other pulmonary problems.
His abdominal wound had some mild erythema at the staple insertion sites and the staples were removed.
