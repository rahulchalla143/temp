Patient reports vomiting the day prior to discharge with no blood in her emesis and a three-day history of diarrhea.
The patient reports complaining of chest tightness which worsens on inspiration, lasts a few seconds, comes and goes.
Patient reports having this type of chest pain in the past, and she seen those from her gastroesophageal reflux disease type symptoms that she complains of repeatedly.
She was also complaining of crampy abdominal pain diffusely throughout the abdomen.
She denies shortness of breath.
Denies any urinary tract symptoms aside from frequency.
Hyperthyroidism for approximately six to eight months.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Denies IV drug use, alcohol, or tobacco.
FAMILY HISTORY:  There is a family history of colon cancer, type 2 diabetes in her grandfather.
No erythema or exudate.
Neck:  No lymphadenopathy.
No jugular venous distention.
Abdomen:  She refused most of the abdominal exam.
No rebound or guarding.
Skin:  Multiple areas of acanthosis nigricans on her neck and between the axillary folds.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema, 2+ pulses dorsalis pedis, popliteal.
Neuro exam:  Alert and oriented times three, 5/5 strength bilaterally, 2+ deep tendon reflexes, no focal signs or deficits notable.
Urinalysis was notable for a specific gravity of 1.
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 102651**] glucose, trace blood, negative for urinary tract infection.
EKG showed no acute changes associated with ischemia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 49-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes, insulin dependent, with severe insulin resistance and also a reported history of insulin antibodies questioning diagnosis type 1 versus type 2 diabetes, history of hyperthyroidism, hypertension, asthma, and marked obesity, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, who presented to the Emergency Department and was treated initially for hyperglycemic with blood sugars reported to be greater than 800.
She did not have an anion gap and no evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis.
However, given the questionable diagnosis of type 1 versus type 2 diabetes and severe hyperglycemia, she was treated with aggressive fluid rehydration.
Hypotension:  Over the course of the first 24 hours of her hospital stay, the patient became profoundly hypotensive on the floor on [**2128-9-24**] and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for blood pressure and hemodynamic management.
It was ultimately determined that the patient was extremely hypovolemic secondary to an osmotic diuresis that had gone on for multiple days.
She was given three liters of intravenous fluids on the floor with minimal blood pressure response.
With her blood pressure stabilized she was transferred back from the Intensive Care Unit on [**2128-9-25**] to the floor for continued management of her oscillating hyper and hypoglycemia.
Hyperglycemia:  This is a patient who presents with repeated history of hyperglycemia complicated by a failure to adequately control her blood sugars.
However, during her hospital stay she had multiple episodes of hypoglycemia, and her insulin requirement was titrated down accordingly.
However, in house with decreased caloric consumption and closer blood sugar monitoring, this seemed to adequately control the patient's blood sugar.
Rule out myocardial infarction:  The patient was ultimately ruled out for an myocardial infarction per enzymes and EKG.
Hyperthyroidism:  The patient was diagnosed with Graves' disease and hyperthyroidism.
Extreme hyperglycemia without ketoacidosis.
Rule out myocardial infarction.
