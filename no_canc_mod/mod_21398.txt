He has been having several weeks of chest pain that he describes as a burning sensation across his entire chest and radiating down both arms.
He does not have presyncopal symptoms or syncopal episodes.
He reports one episde over the weekend where he felt some discomfort sitting on his bed, and he took 2 SL NTG with some relief.
He reports some DOE but it has been ongoing for several years.
He went to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital about 2 weeks ago for these symptoms and was diagnosed with bronchitis.
He saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] last week who told him his symptoms were due to his AS and that he would have to have his surgery soon.
Because his symptoms have not gotten any better, his wife drove him to the [**Name (NI) **] today.
Past Medical History: -- MI x 2: [**2080**], late [**2087**] (no intervention) -- critical AS -- h/o TIAs/CVA 5-6 years ago, had a catheterization that showed carotid stenosis but no cardiac disease per pt -- left CEA [**7-/2117**] -- borderline diabetic -- gout x 8 months -- CRI after catheterization (unsure if pre-existing) -- diverticulitis [**9-7**]   Social History:  Lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 108**] for 8 months of the year and in [**Location (un) 86**] [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) **].
He drinks alcohol rarely and does not use illicit substances  Family History: Unremarkable  Physical Exam: PE: VS: 97.2, 66, 102/43, 19, 95% RA Gen: awake, alert, interactive, pleasant elderly man lying comfortably on stretcher in NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, OP clear, MMM Neck: supple, no LAD, no JVD, no thyroid mases palpated CV: RRR, soft S1S2, III/VI cresc-decresc systolic murmur LUSB Lungs: diffuse exp wheezes b/l Abd: +BS, S/NT/ND, obese Ext: no c/c/e, DP pulses [**12-6**]+ b/l   Pertinent Results: Cardiac cath: 1.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease in a right dominant circulation.
The LMCA had mild diffuse disease.
The LAD had a proximal focal 70% stenosis immediately after the D1 branch.
Resting hemodynamics from right and left heart catheterization reveal elevated right sided filling pressures RVEDP=11mmHg and normal left sided filling pressures LVEDP=11mmHg and mean PCWP=11mmHg.
Severe aortic stenois was present with peak-to-peak gradient of 55mmHg and mean gradient of 44 mmHg.
Left ventriculogram not performed due to elevated creatinine.
Small bilateral pleural effusions layer posteriorly.
There are complex(mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Transgastric mid-papillary view shows evidence of hypovolemia.
All the four pulmonary veins were visualized with no increase in velocities.
An echocardiogram was performed which revealed severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.5cm2.
A cardiac catheterization was performed which revealed severe three vessel disease in addition to the known severe aortic stenosis.
As he had a large hematoma and a new femoral bruit post catheterization, a femoral ultrasound was obtained which showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula.
Mr. [**Known lastname 29571**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which revealed moderate plaque on the right with a 40-59% carotid stenosis and the left had less than a 40% stenosis status post endarterectomy.
Mr. [**Known lastname 46217**] preoperative chest x-ray revealed a fullness which was likely a goiter.
A CT scan was performed which showed a multinodular goiter, a trachea which was narrowed to two thirds of its normal diameter at the level of the thyroid, moderate-to-severe emphysema, small hiatal hernia and a probable liver cyst which incompletely assessed.
The enodocrinology service was consulted who recommended a thyroidectomy given that he was hyperthyroid, there was tracheal compression and the elevated risk of cancer.
It was decided that a concommittant thyroidectomy would be peformed with his cardiac surgery.
As Mr. [**Known lastname 29571**] had some renal failure post catheterization, the renal service was consulted and a renal ultrasound was performed.
This showed multiple right renal cysts and a nonobstructing kidney stone on the left.
He underwent a bronchoscopy for thickened secretions and a collapsed right upper lobe with good success.
On postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 29571**] developed rapid atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion and amiodarone.
Mr. [**Known lastname 29571**] continued to require chest physiotherapy and pulmonary toilet.
The renal service continued to follow him for mild postoperative renal failure.
