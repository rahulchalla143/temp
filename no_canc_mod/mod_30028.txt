Admission Date:  [**2155-7-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2155-8-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2097-3-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: Fever and mental status changes   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1.
Patient is a 58 y/o male with a history of HIV (CD4 36, VL 14,700 on [**7-9**]), T2DM, and HTN s/p recent admission with brain lesions who presented with confusion and fevers.
He was recently admitted from [**Date range (3) 93327**] for mental status changes.
He was found to have a new lesion on brain MRI and new seizures.
Brain biopsy was non-diagnostic and he had a post-op sub-arachnoid hemorrhage that was stable on serial CT scans.
No focal neuro defecits per neuro on admission.
He had a Head CT that showed a new large region of hypodensity of the left frontal white matter adjacent to the previously identified subcentimeter lesion near the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Patient was initially sent to the floor for further work up but was minimally responsive, febrile, tacchycardic and shaking and was sent to the MICU.
The shaking was thought to be due to fever and rigor and not seizure activity.
MRI was also done while in the MICU showing multiple new enhancing lesions and T2 abnormalities are seen in both cerebral hemispheres as well as the right inferior cerebellum.
Patient denied HA, vision changes, nausea, chest pain, shorntess of breath, abdominal pain.
Past Medical History: -HIV diagnosed [**3-14**]: CD4 count 17 in [**5-15**], VL<50; started on HAART earlier this year, with reduction in VL -History of PCP PNA [**Name9 (PRE) 93328**]/HAV -History of knife wound in Montserrat in [**2135**].
Physical Exam: T 98.1 P 110 BP 142/76 R 18 O2 sat 98% RA, FSBG 120 Gen- lethargic, slow to respond HEENT- NCAT, anicteric, no injections, pupils small and symmetrical, equally round and reactive to light, OP +thrush- scrapes off with tongue blade, MMM Cor- 3/6 SEM heard best at LUSB, RR, tacchycardic Lungs- poor insp effort, clear anteriorly Abd- +bs, soft, nt, nd, no masses or hsm Extrem- no cce, pedal pulses 2+ b/l Neuro- difficult to assess due to patient cooperation, cn 2-12 intact although patient reports decreased sensation on left side of face, right arm and leg strength 3/5 vs [**3-13**] on left.
New large region of hypodensity of the left frontal white matter adjacent to the previously identified subcentimeter lesion near the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
These findings are nonspecific but are likely in part due to edema possibly from progression of the lesion at this site.
This appearance would be unusual for infarction as it does not conform to a vascular territorial distribution.
Further evaluation with gadolinium enhanced MR is suggested.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Stable CT appearance of hypodensity near the right frontal lesion and of the left cerebellar hemisphere.
Resolution of bleeding at the right-sided biopsy site.
MRI/MRA [**2155-8-1**]: MRI IMPRESSION:  Multiple new enhancing lesions and T2 abnormalities are seen in both cerebral hemispheres as well as the right inferior cerebellum.
Differential diagnosis includes toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, or cryptococcus infection.
Previously noted inferior left cerebellar atrophic changes and signal changes are again identified.
No evidence of vascular occlusion, stenosis or an aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size are seen.
Unchanged appearance of hypodensity extending from the left frontal white matter to the left basal ganglia, with associated effacement of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
Although this area did not enhance on previous MRI, there was significant FLAIR abnormality in this region.
Differential considerations include evolving infectious process such as toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, or cryptococcus.
Unchanged confluent areas of hypodensity within the frontal lobes with associated effacement of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
Unchanged rounded hypodensities within the right frontal subcortical white matter, right thalamus, and left basal ganglia.
As previously mentioned, the differential includes infectious processes such as toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis or cryptococcus.
Two new hyperdense rounded foci within the left frontal subcortical white matter/[**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter.
Other differential diagnoses would include hemorrhagic metastases and septic emboli.
Small parenchymal hemorrhages are less likely but cannot be excluded.
Laboratory Results: [**2155-8-22**] 04:31a Source: Line-PICC Sodium 133 Chloride 103 BUN  18 Glucose 83   AGap=13 Potassium 4.3 HCO3 21 Crt 1.8 Ca: 9.9 Mg: 1.9 P: 3.2  Source: Line-PICC  WBC 4.1  Hemoglobin 8.5 Platelets 131 HCT  24.5   Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 58 year old man with HIV/AIDs (CD4 count 34) who presented to the emergency room with fevers and change in mental status, with imaging and microbiology results most consistent with cerebral toxoplasmosis.
Brain lesions most consistent with Toxoplasmosis: .
CSF fluid was negative for [**Male First Name (un) 2326**] Virus (by PCR), HSV 1&2 (PCR), Syphillis VDRL, CMV  and Toxoplasmosis IgG/IgM.
He was started on intravenous Bactrim in the MICU but was switched to oral Pyrimethamine/Sulfadiazine once nasogastric tube was placed due to concern over rising creatinine and worsening renal function.
As a result, the patient did not initially receive consistent treatment of for toxoplasmosis.
The patient is now on day 8 of consistent treatment for toxoplasmosis, and should complete a total of 14 days.
Of note, EBV DNA in the CSF via PCR was found to be "equivocal" meaning that the test was neither definitively positive or negative, and trace monoclonal IgG kappa was found in the CSF fluid.
This could be suggestive of possible PCNSL, although the nature of the cereberal lesions are more suggestive of toxoplasmosis than a lymphomatous process.
Imaging was repeated a various times throughout his stay due to lethargy, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, as well as vomiting and nausea, all of which subsequently improved greatly.
The imaging showed new lesions, however it was felt that this was not yet a failure of treatment for his toxoplasmosis, given he had not consistently been getting medications.
At the time of discharge to rehab, the patient's mental status and motor function had been improving on the consistent toxoplasmosis therapy.
After about 2 weeks of consistent toxoplasmosis therapy, the patient's brain will be re-imaged via MRI w/ gadollinium.
Truvada/Kaletra were were started [**8-22**] with renal dosing.
Acute Renal failure Patient's Cr rose during the hospital stay from 1.5 on admission to as high as 2.3.
It was thought that the rise was most likely secondary to drug effect, especially Ambisone, and to a less degree Truvada and Bactrim.
Diabetes Patient's blood sugars were under good control- 100's to 140's range, however he was taking very little PO during most of his stay.
Poor appetite Speech and swallow have evaluated patient due to poor intake, as there was concern he was having dysphagia or other neurological problems with eating.
It was found that he does not appear to have any risk of aspiration or other difficulties eating or swallowing--however, he does not appear to be interested in eating many of the hospital foods.
An abdominal binder is being used to keep it in place.
Anemia: His anemia has been stable.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease, and it was also thought that a number of his medications, especially bactrim, were contributing to his anemia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: - Toxoplasmosis Secondary Diagnoses: - HIV/AIDS - Hepatitis B - Hypertension - Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted due to fever and decreased mental status.
A number of tests were done, including blood test, tests on your cerebral spinal fluid, and imaging, which demonstrated it was likely you had an infection in your [**Doctor Last Name **].
You should continue to take all of your medications as prescribed in order to treat the infection, as well as your underlying medical conditions and other illnesses.
During your stay, you had difficulty eating enough and taking your medications, so a tube was placed to assist with getting you medications and nutrition.
Please contact your primary care doctor or go to the emergency room if you experience fever, chills, drowsiness, new weakness, numbness, or tingling, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or other concerning symptoms.
