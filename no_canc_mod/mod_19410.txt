2.9 cm acute parenchymal hemorrhage in the left temporoparietal region with surrounding edema, unchanged over the roughly 3 hr interval.
Since [**2191-7-4**], increase in size of left subdural hematoma along the tentorium and falx, as well as overlying the left temporal lobe with possible subarachnoid hemorrhage of the left temporal and occipital lobes.
Small enhancing extra-axial lesion which likely represents a calcified meningioma of the anterior interhemispheric fissure.
Unchanged left posterior temporal hyperdense focus consistent with acute parenchymal hemorrhage.
Extra-axial hypodense collection along the left tentorium and left falx consistent with subdural hematoma and unchanged.
6 mm hyperdense focus within the anterior aspect of the interhemispheric fissure previously characterized as possible calcified meningioma.
No epileptiform changes.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname 4457**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 45503**] was admitted for stepdown level care on the stroke service for close evaluation and management of left temporoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
It was thought that this hemorrhage was most likely due to the recent fall on her left face.
On the second day of admission, an MRI showed this hemorrhage and a left subdural hematoma along the tentorium and falx, as well as overlying the left temporal lobe; on review, the detection of the subdural bleeding was impaired on her initial CT scan due to head motion that significantly limited the study.
Her physical examination remained relatively stable over the hospital course, with notable difficulty in cognition.
The patient continued to have word-finding difficulties, memory loss, and some aphasia (impaired naming).
Repeat head CT [**2191-7-6**] (~2 days after 1st scan) revealed no further progession of bleeding.
The patient was placed on keppra for seizure prophylaxis, and an EEG reportedly showed non-specific slowing without epileptiform discharges (final interpretation pending).
The patient also presented with a low sodium of 126.
Laboratories studies suggested SIADH (likely associated with the CNS trauma), but the patient also had reduced oral intake prior to admission with a marginal urine output.
The patient has a history of hypothyroidism; her TSH was normal, but with a slightly elevated free T4.
