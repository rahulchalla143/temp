Today while visiting, patient's brother noted that she was confused and disoriented, and had difficulty walking.
or medication changes.
Patient is denying pain, shortness of breath, or nausea.
Had low grade temperature to 100.7, and was given ceftriaxone for empiric meningitis coverage, but no LP was performed, head CT within normal limits.
Patient received 10 mg of Haldol and 1.5 mg of Ativan due to agitation during CT.
Patient was seen by Toxicology and Renal services, who agreed with hemodialysis for lithium toxicity.
Depression, with question of bipolar disorder.
Parkinson's disease with gait disorder and history of falls.
Lumbar disk disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Dry mucous membranes.
Neck:  No JVD, moderately supple.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, normal S1, S2.
Extremities:  No edema.
Neurologic:  Patient not cooperative with exam, moves upper extremities, question mild cogwheel rigidity, lower extremity hyperreflexia, positive ankle clonus.
EKG on admission:  Sinus bradycardia with normal axis, normal QRS and Q-T, no ischemic changes.
Chest x-ray on admission:  Questionable small left lower lobe infiltrate.
Repeat blood and urine from [**3-6**] also with no growth.
Head CT [**3-4**]:  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of depression, who presents to the ED with mental status changes and was subsequently found to have lithium toxicity and acute renal failure.
Lithium toxicity:  Etiology likely from chronic use in setting of prerenal insult and hypovolemia with unclear precipitating factor.
Subsequent lithium levels remained within normal limits and no further hemodialysis was required.
Acute renal failure, prerenal etiology:  Patient was resuscitated with IV fluids and her creatinine subsequently returned to baseline levels.
Mental status changes most likely due to lithium toxicity.
Some question whether patient could additionally have had an infectious etiology as she had a low-grade fever throughout her stay.
Given that she had a nonfocal neurologic examination, a meningitis/encephalitis or stroke as an etiology for delta MS was considered unlikely, therefore lumbar puncture and MRI respectively were considered, but not pursued.
Questionable left lower lobe infiltrate:  Patient remained without impressive symptoms or exam findings.
Finding most likely felt to be consistent with atelectasis.
Hypertension:  Patient's antihypertensive regimen was held on admission given acute renal failure and hypotension.
Patient's agitation has resolved and was no longer requiring restraints.
Acute renal failure.
