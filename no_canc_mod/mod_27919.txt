Family History: Her sister has died of uterine cancer at the age of 75 years and  her brother is still living and reportedly in good health.

no focal cn/motor/sensory deficits  Pertinent Results: CXR: Persistent infiltrate, possible incr left mid lung zone, no major change .
CT head: No hemorrhage, sinusitis unchanged (complete paranasal opacities) .
ECG: Sinus tach, nl axis, nl intervals, lvh, no q/st-t changes/twi .
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
MRI with DWI may be performed to exclude subtle abnormalities as clinically warranted.
Right lower lobe consolidation, left lower lobe consolidation, scattered bilateral ground-glass and nodular opacities appear slightly worse in the interim.
New right lower lobe lateral aspect consolidation.
Increased small bilateral pleural effusions.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
Contrast enhancement within the urinary collecting system and gallbladder probably due to previous cardiac catheterization and poor renal function.
Brief Hospital Course:    This 80 yo female with a h/o interstitial lung disease (?miliary pattern), MALT lymphoma, bilat breast ca s/p bilat mastectomies, cryptococcal and aspergillus pna's in [**2119**] and aspergillus in [**2123**], recent MRSA pna currently on 6wk course of linezolid (started [**12-6**]), recent sinusitis s/p 2 weeks levoflox (finished 1 wk prior to admission)), recent C. diff (finished metronidazole 5-6 days ago), who initially presented with a 2 days of diarrhea, decreased po intake, dizziness, weakness, and falls.
On the floor, she was initially treated with Flagyl for possible C. diff (this was stopped on [**1-10**] with 1 neg C. diff and the recommendation of ID.
It was thought that her delta MS may have been due to underlying infection, and source for this was sought out.
Given her h/o sinusitis, ENT was consulted; as she had no clinical symptoms of sinusitis, decision was made to treat with NS nasal spray.
Pulmonary, ID, and thoracics were consulted to evaluate her chronic lung process that appeared unchanged on CT from this admission (pt still with RLL consolidation with cavitary component, unchanged from prior study despite 4 weeks of linezolid).
Cultures have remained negative, and pt has had only low-grade fevers.
Interdisciplinary family meeting on [**1-10**] was held, and it was decided to proceed with CT-guided core biopsy when possible to biopsy lung process and lymph nodes.
Heme/onc was also consulted with respect to hypogammoglobulinemia and recommended IVIG (which she received on [**1-7**]).
She was transferred to the MICU on [**2124-1-10**], she became tachypneic on the floor approximately 1 hour s/p PRBC transfusion, with RR to 40's, with ABG of 7.17/76/217 (?baseline CO2).
She became tachycardic (to 120s) and hypotensive (SBPs in 70s from baseline of 150) in this setting.
She had no specific complaints and stated her breathing felt better.
Her hypercarbic respiratory failure seemed to correlate temporarily with blood transfusion (1hr s/p).
Hypovolemia is most likely etiology    - bolus as necessary for bp; follow UO, goal even to 500 cc positive    - will reck TTE in am; EKG without ischemic signs, no reason to suspect cardiogenic shock .
Currently completing 6 week course of linezolid and ID following closely     - send bld cx, Ucx, C. diff, sputum     - plan is for CT-guided biopsy--?lymphoma, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, infection, fungal, ILD on differential for lung process; touch base with thoracics and radiology (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4401**] in am     - Continue Linezolid for now     - low threshold to broaden abx coverage if decompensates     - f/u ID recs     - leukocytosis may be stress response although is concerning for infection; will follow     - no empiric C. diff treatment for now     - no rx for ?sinusitis at this time, d/w ID .
CHF: signs of dCHF on TTE from [**11-27**]; BNP elevated but seems intravascularly depleted, BP responed to IVF      - follow I/Os and lung exam .
Anemia: - S/p PRBC yesterday - Getting pan CT to look for bleeding site, concern for RP bleed vs. head bleed - 1 unit PRBC today.
14   Neuro:  New onset left sided weakness and blown pupil on the left - head CT todayP: 80f with hypogammaglobulinemia, interstitial lung disease, multiple pna's, recent mrsa pna/sinusitis/c.
diff, h/o breast cancer presents with increasing confusion, weakness, dizziness, and falls.
This appears to be most likely severe dehydration/hypovolemia related to diarrhea and decreased po intake.
and re-hydrate, dealing with diarrhea as below.
Send off sputum, blood cx, legionella urinary ag, galactomannan  With hypogammaglobulinemia, will likely need heme and id consults for question of IVIg and abx tailoring, respectively.
-id has been consulted, regarding chronic infiltrate, and current antibx therapy both for MRSA infiltrate and chronic sinusitis -heme consulted, regarding hypogammaglobulinemia .
