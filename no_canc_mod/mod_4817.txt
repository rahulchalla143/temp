There was also an additional identification of a urinary tract infection which was treated with 7 day course of antibiotics during this admission.
Please see below for full hospital course details:  # Clostridium difficile colitis: Stool studies tested positive for C.difficile toxin and CT of abdomen reported pronounced pancolonic wall thickening and pericolonic fat stranding but no free air, free fluid or pathologic lymphadenopathy.
Numerous mesenteric nodes were seen which were felt to be reactive LAD in setting of infection.
Other initial considerations for his abdominal pain included ischemia as peak lactate 2.4, but 24 hours later lactate had dropped to 1.4.
He was started on IV Flagyl and PO vancomycin with good clinical response and diarrhea and abdominal cramping decreased over several days.
Surgery evaluated films and the patient and felt there was no need for any interventions given his rapid recovery on medications and recommended more conservative management with antibiotics.
Mr. [**Known lastname 23747**] abdominal cramps continued to be better overall but he had some brief breakthrough pain on [**2127-5-19**] that was noted so an upright abdominal film was done and it showed no evidence of any microperforations or free air.
By time of discharge on [**2127-5-21**]  he stated his abdominal pain was "much much better" and his diarrhea had tapered down to 2-5 episodes per 24 hours which was markedly better than his initial presentation.
#Sepsis: As above, the patient had leukocytosis to 26 range, temperature to 100sF, lethargy and sinus tachycardia to 130s on admission so sepsis was the major concern.
Blood cultures returned negative but he had both a proteus UTI and C.difficile colitis on additional studies so his lethargic presentation was first felt to be from urosepsis vs. transient bacteremia from some bowel translocation effects.
However, negative blood cultures ruled out true bacteremia.
He denies any current dysuria, worsened urinary frequency or suprapubic pain.
He has ongoing incontinence at baseline which dates back >15 years along with a diagnosis of an overactive bladder per patient which makes his assessment a bit challenging.
As above he is still being treated with PO Vancomycin and IV Flagyl for his C.difficile colitis infection.
He had no hemodynamic instability or evidence of hypotension or compromised end organ perfusion after transfer out of the MICU to the general medical floor.
# Sinus tachycardia.
This was likely related to sepsis plus hypovolemia with high stool output and frequent urination associated with his UTI.
EKGs and initial telemetry showed sinus tachycardia with no other significant ectopy and no noted ST elevations/depressions to indicated any ischemia.
# Chest pain: He had no complaints of chest pains or any subjective palpitations during his hospital course up until the morning of [**5-20**].
He complained of some left sided sternal pain which was reproducible on physical exam and more consistent with musculoskeletal pain but given his risk factors some additional cardiac enzymes were sent and 2 sets were negative.
A follow-up EKG showed no concerns for any ST elevations/depressions or changes from his usual baseline EKG.
There also seemed to be an anxiety component to his chest discomfort as well as patient complained of having some chest "tightness" and anxiety the day prior which was relieved with Ativan.
CXR was done on [**5-20**] and showed some small bilateral effusions which may have been from some slight fluid overload as his diuretics were held for over a week and a half and he had been given some generous IVFs.
Although normal LVEF of 60% on his last ECHO in [**2124**], he may have some mild diastolic dysfunction which may be underappreciated.
This was discussed with [**Year (4 digits) 3390**] on day of discharge and patient will be placed back on 40mg daily lasix for now which he primarily takes for his LE edema and will advance back to his usual 100mg daily dose at a later date once his diarrhea has completely abated.
# ARF: The patient's rise in Creatinine was attributed to prerenal dehydration from excessive diarrhea and urinary frequency from his UTI.
His diuretics, both Spirinolactone and Lasix were held, and he was initially given IVFs for resuscitation with concern of looming sepsis picture as above.
At time of initial admission he had some anorexia, malaise and was overall less alert.
This was attributed to acute illness and dehydration as he recovered completely and was fully alert and oriented within 2 days after IV/PO antibiotics and IVF resuscitation was initiated.
# UTI: Mr. [**Known lastname 23707**] has a history of Pseudomonas (pansensitive) treated with ciprofloxacin about two months ago.
Here, he was found to have bacteria on urine study and a follow-up culture showed Proteus so he was treated for a complicated UTI with 7 days of IV Cefepime which he completed on [**5-19**].
He had no residual complaints of dysuria or suprapubic tenderness at time of discharge.
He had excellent urine output by time of discharge and no signs of recurrent cystitis.
He has been continued on his regimen of Truvada and Raltegravir while inpatient with no changes.
He was also set up for close follow-up with his [**Month/Year (2) 3390**]/ID physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 1-2 weeks of his discharge.
#Chronic peripheral edema: Team opted to discontinue his usual diuretics, lasix and spirinolactone, due to his dehydration and losses from diarrhea and urinary frequency with his UTI.
Discussed with his [**Name Initial (PRE) 3390**] at time of discharge as he has ongoing edema at his lower extremities which is what he takes diuretics for.
# Depression/Anxiety: He was continued on PRN Ativan as well as his daily Valproate, and Aripiprazole 10 mg daily for mood stability in setting of bipolar disorder alongside his depression and anxiety.
Maalox 200-200-20 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: One (1)  PO PRN as needed for indigestion.
Milk of Magnesia 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: One (1)  PO prn as needed for indigestion.
Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for pain for 2 weeks.

You were admitted with some mild confusion, diarrhea and dehydration.
You were intitially admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) until your rapid heart rate improved and you were more stable.
Additional lab tests and a CT scan of your abdomen were done and you were found to have an infection in your colon called Clostridium difficile colitis that was respnsible for your diarrhea.
Additional urine studies also showed that you had a bladder infection or urinary tract infection.
You were given IV fluids to re-hydrate you and IV and oral antibiotics were given during your hospital stay to treat you for your infections.
Please seek immediate medical attention or return to the emergency room if you experience any fevers, chills, worsening of your abdominal cramps/pain, more frequent diarrhea, bloody stools, burning with urination, bloody urine, chest pains, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, new cough, or any additional health concerns.
MEDICATION INSTRUCTIONS: -Please complete an additional 13 days of oral Vancomycin for full treatment of your Clostridium difficile colitis infection.
-Please hold your Detrol medication for a few more weeks until you discuss restarting this medication with your [**Hospital1 3390**] as you are already taking a similar medicine called oxybutynin for overative bladder and incontinence.
-Hold your Bisacodyl and avoid stool softeners or laxatives as you are recovering from frequent diarrhea.
- Continue your daily aspirin but if you see worse blood in your stools please discontinue this medication and notify M.D.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) **] have been started back on your spirinolactone and a lower dose of your daily Lasix (40mg) until you stop having diarrhea and until you see your [**Name11 (NameIs) 3390**] at [**Name9 (PRE) 702**].
