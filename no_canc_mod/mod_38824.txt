Attenuation and non-visualization of the mid anterior and posterior tibial, and peroneal arteries, with pseudoaneurysm formation in the region of the tibial and fibular fractures, compatible with vascular injury and likely vasospasm.
Extrinsic vascular compression or thrombus formation resulting in vascular occlusion is not excluded.
There is no evidence for active arterial extravasation.
There does appear to be weak reconstitution of flow in both the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries of the foot.
KNEE (2 VIEWS) RIGHT; TIB/FIB (AP & LAT) RIGHT; ANKLE (AP, MORTISE & LAT) RIGH IMPRESSION: Comminuted displaced complete fractures of the distal fibula and tibia.
An intramedullary rod has been placed across the tibial fracture which is in near anatomic alignment.
A lateral plate and screw fixation has been placed across the fibular fracture; alignment of the fibular plate is not well evaluated on these views, but is grossly anatomic.
Radiology Report BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2173-1-21**] 3:06 PM IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
Radiology Report TIB/FIB (AP & LAT) RIGHT Study Date of [**2173-2-5**] 2:22 PM FINDINGS: In comparison with the operative study, there is again an intramedullary rod transfixing a fracture of the lower shaft of the tibia.
No evidence of hardware-related complication.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2173-2-1**]):    NO GROWTH.
POSSIBLE MYCOPLASMA SPECIES.

was admitted to the Orthopedic service on [**2173-1-14**] for left open tibial and fibular fracture after being evaluated and treated with attempted closed reduction, wound lavage and splinting in the emergency room.
CTA of RLE revealed apparent vascular injury of each of the anterior and posterior tibialis, and peroneal arteries, with pseudoaneurysm.
He underwent open reduction internal fixation of the right tibia nad fibula without complication on [**2173-1-14**].
He was extubated without difficulty and transferred to the ICU for vascular monitoring.
On hospital day 1 he developed increasing compartmental tightness and pain with passive stretch of toes.
His compartment pressures were found to be elevated and he was taken to the OR for emergent 4-compartment fasciotomy.
Due to RLE swelling there was not enough skin coverage and wound was left open with VAC dressing in place.
He had adequate pain management and worked with physical therapy while in the hospital.
On [**2173-2-9**], Infectious Disease paged Plastics team to report that 3 out of 3 OR cultures from two separate dates ([**2173-1-30**] and [**2173-2-2**]) were all growing question of mycoplasma.
Discharge Instructions: Wound Care: - You should keep your right lower extremity dry and do not get wet or submerge in water.

- Elevate right leg to reduce swelling and pain.
NEW MEDICATION/DIAGNOSIS: - You had high blood pressure (hypertension) during your hospitalization.
