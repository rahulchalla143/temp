Admission Date:  [**2147-9-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2147-9-24**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, status post pacer, who presented acutely with shortness of breath.
The patient has notably six admissions for CHF in the last eight months, but most recently she was admitted from [**Date range (1) 26451**] for CHF exacerbation and stay was complicated by a non-Q wave MI.
She received stent to the LAD, left circumflex and had episodes of bradycardia to the 30s which required placement of a dual-chamber pacer, as well as rapid afib.
which was treated with amiodarone.
During the course of that hospital stay, the patient underwent hypoxic ventilatory failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation x 3.
At home, the patient was largely bedridden with no shortness of breath, stable orthopnea, no PND or lower extremity edema.
On the morning of admission, the patient became increasingly short of breath with nausea and diaphoresis.
No chest pain and no arm pain.
The patient became acutely hypotensive with systolic blood pressure in the 70s and was placed on a dopamine drip.
Chest x-ray at that time was consistent with pulmonary edema.
ECG showed a paced rhythm at 75 with a question of ST elevations in II, III and F, as well as a question of newly positive axis in V1 and V2 that had previously been negative.
The patient was started on heparin due to concern of acute coronary syndrome.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for coronary artery disease, two-vessel disease, status post stents to the LAD and left circumflex in [**Month (only) 205**] of this year, congestive heart failure with a known ejection fraction of less than 20%, moderate-severe mitral regurg, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
The patient also has a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hypothyroidism, gout, diabetes mellitus.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Generally, the patient was alert and oriented, in no apparent distress.
Neck - the patient had no obvious jugulovenous distention at 30??????.
Chest - the patient had bilateral crackles in a quarter of the lung field.
Cardiovascular exam - the patient had a paced rhythm, normal S1, split S2, no murmur, gallops or rubs, and a diffuse, anteriorly displaced PMI.
Extremities - the patient had trace ankle edema bilaterally and dopplerable DP and PT pulses bilaterally.
Chest x-ray on admission showed no obvious pacer migration with mild cephalization of vessels, a small right pleural effusion and was read as being consistent with mild congestive heart failure.
ECG showed a paced rhythm at 75 with a wide QRS, positive axis in V1 and V2 that was previously negative, and a question of ST elevations in leads II, III and F.  The patient's white count on admission was 17.1 with a differential of 55 neutrophils, 0 bands, 40 lymphocytes.
No evidence of UTI.
IMPRESSION:  In short, this is an 89-year-old female with CAD, CHF, admitted with subacute shortness of breath, and presented with hypotension requiring a dopamine drip.
Ruled out for MI by enzymes.
EKG, although there were ST elevations, they were not considered to be consistent with an ischemic event.
The patient remained chest pain-free throughout the course of her stay.
PUMP FUNCTION:  The patient had a known left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 20%.
She had a repeat echo shortly after admission which showed no significant changes from the previous echo which was done on the [**8-8**].
She was not hypoxic, had trace crackles only, and trace edema with a flat JVP.
The patient became acutely short of breath two nights after admission and hypoxic to 90% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
She was given lasix and diuresed with symptomatic relief.
A chest x-ray at that time showed congestive heart failure.
The patient had no further episodes of respiratory distress throughout the course of her stay.
RHYTHM:  The patient's ECG showed an extremely wide QRS and a change from left bundle to right bundle morphology in V1 and V2 which was felt to be more consistent with the patient's native complex.
2) INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient presented with a low-grade fever and an increased white blood cell count, and an infiltrate versus CHF on chest x-ray.
The patient remained afebrile throughout the course of her stay after the night of admission.
Nevertheless, on her chest x-ray there was also a question of left lower lobe pneumonia versus atelectasis with a left-sided pleural effusion.
Pleural effusion was tapped on the day prior to discharged; results are still pending at the time of this dictation, but the fluid was clear and serous appearing.
4) RENAL:  The patient presented with a creatinine that was slightly elevated above her baseline of 0.9-1.2.
FINAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  1) Congestive heart failure.
2) Hypotension likely secondary to hypovolemia.
3) Coronary artery disease.
