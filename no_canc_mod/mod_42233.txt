History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 56 year old woman with history of Crohn's disease c/b rectovaginal fistula and multiple small bowel resections, h/o SVC syndrome s/p angioplasty on fondaparinux, (h/o HIT), h/o parathyroid adenoma who presents with progressive RUE pain and developing hematoma, as well as subacute onset of lower abdominal pain.
The following day, the patient reported worsening right upper extremity pain and a large developing hematoma.
She presented to the ED on Wednesday where an ultrasound did not show evidence of clot, but did show large hematoma.
She subsequently saw her PCP the following day where her hematoma was marked out.
Yesterday, the patient bumped her arm during a fall and had acute severe pain.
In addition, for the preceding 24 hours, she reports progressive abdominal distension, and decreased passage of bowel movements.
Patient does have long standing history of vomiting per pt, and reports worse after methotrexate which she had on Monday.
She complains of low grade fevers ~100 since Tuesday.
In the ED, she was told that she had a pneumonia based on CXR.
She denies any cough, bloody stools/emesis, chest pain, or shortness of breath.
She was seen in clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 79**] on [**10-26**] where she wascomplaining of abdominal pain and diarrhea.
She was also started on Hydromorphone for control of severe pain.
Of note, she was admitted in [**8-13**] with a low hematocrit to 23.1.
On arrival to the MICU, vital signs were T 98.2 HR 99 BP 118/72 RR 11 O2 sat 98% RA patient reported the history above and complained of severe pain in the right arm and mild abdominal pain and distension.
She notes that she has not had a bowel movement since Thursday, but has been passing flatus.

Hazy opacity in the right upper lung field is not significantly changed and likely represent an area of chronic airspace disease.
Overlying infection cannot be excluded.
Nasogastric tube with both side port and the tip above the gastroesophageal junction raised increased risk for aspiration.
[**2116-10-31**] CT Abd/Pelv: There is no retroperitoneal bleed.
There is no free air or free fluid.
[**2116-10-31**] X-ray shoulder and elbow: No specific radiographic evidence of displaced fracture or dislocation of the right elbow and right shoulder.
Soft tissue contusion overlying the right elbow.
Multiple air-fluid levels with dilated loops of bowel suggest small-bowel obstruction.
Micro: None  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 56 year old woman with Crohn's disease complicated by rectovaginal fistula and multiple SBOs s/p multiple abdominal surgeries, also with prior SVC surgery now on fondaparinux, who was transferred to ICU from ED for hypotension and HCT drop of 15 in past 4 days likely due to her right upper extremity hematoma.
# Acute blood loss anemia: Patient had 14 point Hct drop over the course of 5 days (38.7 on [**2116-10-26**] to 24.3 on [**2116-10-31**]).
The most likely source of this anemia is acute blood loss from large hematoma in RUE (below) thought to be related to trauma from venipuncture on routine outpatient lab work in the setting of her anticoagulation with fondaparinux.
Patient also noted a fall onto right arm as well, which also could have contributed to the large hematoma.
Other possible causes of anemia were considered including retroperitoneal bleed, GI losses, or hemolysis, but there was no evidence of RP bleed on CT, NG lavage and guaiac were negative in the ED, and Tbili was normal.
Due to the patients psychological stressors from being in the hospital, she declined further lab draws.
She understood the risks of declining the lab draw, including the risk of a continued bleed and even death, and she accepted these risks.
# Right Upper Ext Hematoma: Likely due to deep stick in right antecubital fossa on Monday while on fondaparinux for her SVC surgery in [**2115**].
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] evidence of compartment syndrome on exam and she remained neurovascularly intact.
She was seen by vascular surgery who felt she should restart her fondaparinux on Sunday [**11-1**] given that there was no longer evidence of active bleeding.
# Partial SBO: Patient has history of Crohn's disease and has had multiple bowel obstructions and surgeries.
One day prior to admission patient reported progressive abdominal distension and decreased passage of bowel movements.
KUB showed distended loops and air fluid levels concerning for obstruction, and CT revealed large amount of stool in the colon with no evidence of free air or transition point.
The most likely source of her hypotension is poor po intake in the setting of vomiting and diarrhea.
On the differential would be hypovolemia secondary to acute blood loss from hematoma in arm (above).
Sepsis is unlikely given that she has afebrile without leukocytosis, and her BPs have stabilized and the remainder of her vitals are normal.
# Right apical lung opacity: Patient with RUL opacity on CXR in ED.
She was given one dose of levofloxacin emperically in the ED, but there was no concern for infection on the floor and this was discontinued.
CT stability documented and there is no acute change to suggest infection or malignancy.
This can be followed by xray only unless change or symptoms are noted.
# Pain Management: Patient's home pain regimen had been escalated by PCP given pain from hematoma (above) to 4-8 mg dilaudid PO Q4H prior to admission.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was transitioned to IV dilaudid while in house given the partial bowel obstruction (above) and also requested 50 mg IV benadryl for itching.
When her partial bowel obstruction resolved and she self-discontinued her NGT, she was transitioned back to PO pain medications.
# Crohn's disease: Diagnosed [**2079**].
History of rectovaginal fistula and short bowel syndrome.
Initially complianing of abdominal pain and distension on admission with KUB concerning for obstruction.
# SVC syndrome s/p angioplasty: Patient noticed episodes of facial and neck swelling in [**2101**].
She was seen by vascular surgery while in house and they recommended restarting fondaparinux on Sunday [**11-1**] given apparent stability of RUE hematoma.
# Hypothyroidism: Stable.
# Transitional issues: - Patient should have hematocrit checked within 1-3 days of discharge to monitor for stability (last hct 24.6)  Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Right upper extremity hematoma, Partial small bowel obstruction, Secondary diagnosis: Crohn's disease, Heparin induced thrombocytopenia, SVC syndrome   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Please keep your arm elevated and have your blood levels drawn tomorrow at [**Hospital1 **].
In addition, your bowels slowed down and caused you to have a partial obstruction.
There were no changes made to your medication regimen.
