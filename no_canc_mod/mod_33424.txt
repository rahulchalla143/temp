Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 46 year old female with history of Down Syndrome, repaired ASD, and severe right sided heart failure, pulmonary hypertension with prior admissions for acute exacerbations for volume overload was transferred from OSH for dyspnea, bradycardia, [**Last Name (un) **] and hyperkalemia.
According to patient's sister, at 12pm on [**9-20**], patient had acute drop in her urine output.
She increased her fluid intake by few hundred mls without any corresponding increase in urine outpt.
Patient has been on 3L home O2 for low O2 sats for the past 2 years.
At OSH, her CXR was suspicious for pneumonia and CHF, and she was given both Levofloxacin 750 mg and Furosemide 80 mg IV prior to transfer.
She reported sore throat, coughing, vague chest pain, and abdominal pain.
EKG showed NSR with RBBB and no peaked T waves.
CXR showed severe cardiomegaly and moderate pulmonary edema.
She was admitted to the CCU for further management of her CHF and multiple electrolyte abnormalities.
On the floor she reports epigastric and RUQ abdominal pain.
She had taken 4 over the counter aleve tablet for her pain in the past few days.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

No organomegaly.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, rashes, or other lesions.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity dilation with free wall hypokinesis.
Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
CXR: [**2121-9-21**] PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Severe cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement is noted.
Bilateral hazy opacities in both lung fields, consistent with moderate to severe pulmonary edema.
No large pleural effusions or pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION:  Severe cardiomegaly and moderate pulmonary edema.
Abdominal Ultrasound: [**2121-9-22**] FINDINGS:  The liver shows no focal or textural abnormalities.
The gallbladder is normal without evidence of stones.
The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow and a normal-appearing waveform.
There is no ascites.
Both right and left kidneys are normal without evidence of hydronephrosis or stones.
Brief Hospital Course: 46 year old female with Down Syndrome and repaired congenital heart disease with prior admissions for severe right heart failure in [**2119**] who was transferred from OSH for dyspnea, malaise, bradycardia, [**Last Name (un) **] and multiple electrolyte abnormalities.
# Acute on Chronic Right Ventricular Failure: Patient has history of right heart failure with pulmonary hypertension from [**2119**] TTE.
She presented with volume overload during this admission in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **] (see below).
She had TEE on [**9-22**] which showed pulmonary hypertension and seere right sided global hypokinesis with no significant change since her [**2119**] TTE.
It is possible that patient is very sensitive NSAID.
Patient's hyperkalemia most likely resulted in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **] and receiving daily 60mEq of potassium.
Her hyperkalemia resolved with return of patient kidney function.
After she started making urine, she continued to be hypokalemia in the 3 and required her home dose of 60mg oral solution.
# Hypotonic hypervolumic Hyponatremia: Hyponatremia likely in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **] worsened with use of metolazone in the outpatient setting.
Patient has left anterior fascicular block and in the setting of hyperkalemia probably had complete heart block.
During this hospital stay she had an episode of bradycardia on tele most likely ectopic atrial vs junctional rhythm lasting for few seconds without any symptoms.
Initial Troponin 0.06 in ED without ischemic EKG changes most likely in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **].
# Abdominal pain: On admission patinet ocmplained of epigastric and RUQ pain.
Her LFTs were normal and abdominal ultrasound perfomred was normal without any ascties for hepatic ongestion.
On day of discahrge her abdominal pain had resolved which was most likely from GERD .
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) **] will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further management of her right heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.
Acute on Chronic Right Heart failure 3.
Hyponatremia 4.
Hyperkalemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted because you had worsenng kidney function most likely from taking Aleve at home.
And because of your worsening kidney function you were accumulating fluid in your body which was causing you shortness of breath and feeling of fatigue.
