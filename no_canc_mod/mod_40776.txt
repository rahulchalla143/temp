He fell to the floor and developed loss of consciousness with pursed lip breathing.
Per report, his initial rhythm was thought to be a wide complex tachycardia without evidence of pacer spikes.
He underwent temporary pacing; however, shortly afterward, he was found to have native spikes.
As temporary pacing was discontinued, he had return of his native spikes and regular sinus rhythm.
His ED course was complicated by hypotension while on propafol.

However, suggest short interval followup.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
The septum is nearly akinetic and the other basal segments moderately hypokinetic.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with severe septal hypokinesis, moderate hypokinesis of the basal to mid segments and relative preservation of the apical segments.
The degree of aortic stenosis is probably severe (velocity falsely LOW due to reduced systolic function).
Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
Mild mitral and moderate tricuspid regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The right ventricle now appears dilated and hypokinetic.
The degree of aortic stenosis has increased.
No clear localizing symptoms from prior to event and no localizing signs on exam.
Head CT was negative for acute process.
LENIS were obtained and showed no DVT.
Further CXRs showed no evidence of PTX.
Patient does not seem to have a clear diagnosis of baseline pulmonary disease however he did have over-hydration on the CXR.
After receiving fluids he did have increased pulmonary congestion on a CXR and decreased O2 sats so received some diuresis with 20mg IV lasix.
CAD Patient has a history of of CAD s/p CABG.
No clear history of chest pain and ECG looked relatively unchanged from prior.
The TTE showed new wall motion abnormalities of RV consistent with prior ETT that showed reversible inferior wall ischemia.
In the setting of this it is possible that he did have an acute coronary event, however, with no clear symptoms of chest pain and no EKG changes patient was managed conservatively with beta blockers, asa, statin, ACE as above.
Depression and Dementia: He was continued on his home citalopram, aricept, and Namenda.
Atrial Fibrillation Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is s/p ppm placement.
LENIs were ordered and showed no dvt.
Possibly has chronic venous stasis from this.
This could have been cause of his fall as he could have syncopized.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Atrial Fibrillation Severe AS CHF   Discharge Condition: The patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable prior to discharge.
You had to have a tube down your throat to help you breath but this quickly came out and you were breathing well on your own.
Medication Changes: START: Warfarin 5mg daily START: Cozaar 25mg daily CHANGE: Aspirin to 81mg daily  Please come back to the hospital or call your primary care doctor if you have fainting or near fainting, dizziness, light-headedness, shortness of breath, chest pain, jaw pain, arm pain, nausea, abdominal pain, palpitations, blood in your stools or black tarry stools, weight gain more than 3lbs in one day, leg swelling, or any other concerning symptoms.
