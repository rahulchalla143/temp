She was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**5-12**] for abdominal pain, which they thought could be due to ischemic bowel in the rectum and sigmoid (based on imaging), and it was managed medically.
At the same time, patient was + for C. diff colitis.
She was going to be transferred for possible sepsis from cholecystitis vs. colitis to [**Hospital1 2025**] on Reglan, Metoprolol, Zofran, Flagyl, Zosyn (unclear reasons), [**Name (NI) 85572**], possible [**Name (NI) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], imdur, meclozine regularly for management of possible cholecystitis.
While in [**Hospital1 18**], they noted patient had anginal symptoms at rest which had only been non-exertional angina.
She reported stable anginal and several episodes of syncope over the last few months with increasing LE edema.
There was no SOB or orthopnea.
It was thought that this could be due to CHF exacerbation.
She is still net positive 5 L.

Pertinent Results: [**2173-5-26**] 03:16PM   CK-MB-2 cTropnT-1.08* [**2173-5-26**] 07:57AM   CK-MB-2 cTropnT-1.15* [**2173-5-26**] 01:42AM   CK-MB-2 proBNP-[**Numeric Identifier 85573**]*  2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2173-5-27**]  demonstrated: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %).
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
with depressed free wall contractility.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
ETT: no record in [**Hospital1 18**] or OSH record CARDIAC CATH: no record in [**Hospital1 18**] or OSH record HEMODYNAMICS: no record in [**Hospital1 18**] or OSH record .
OTHER TESTING: - [**5-18**] CT abd: pneumonia in the right lung base, b/l trace pleural effusion, cardiomegaly, severe atherosclerosis, no ischemic colitis, milk of calcium vs. tiny GB stone in the GB, status post hysteretomy - [**5-18**] abd U/S- no GB wall thickening, possible + [**Doctor Last Name **] sign - [**5-22**] CT abd pelvis (OSH)- b/l pleural effusion, atelectasis, cholelithiasis, + ascites, levocurvature of the lumbar spine, coronary atherosclerosis and calficication of the abdominal aorta.
- [**5-20**]- C diff + - [**5-26**] CT ABDOMEN ([**Hospital1 18**]): There are bilateral moderate pleural effusion and bibasilar mild atelectasis.
The liver enhances homogeneously without focal lesion.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
The gallbladder is nondistended with minimal pericholecystic fluid likely due to third spacing.
There is no evidence of acute cholecystitis.
Hyperdensity layering in the gallbladder wall likely represent small stones as seen on prior study (ultrasound [**2173-5-26**]).
The spleen, pancreas, adrenals, stomach, loops of small and large bowel appear unremarkable.
Bilateral renal hypodensities likely represent simple cysts.
There is no hydronephrosis or stones.
There is no free intraperitoneal air.
There is no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
Small amount of pelvic free fluid is noted.
There is no free air or lymphadenopathy.
There is diffuse calcified atherosclerosis throughout the abdominal aorta and both iliacs with no significant stenosis or aneurysm formation.
BONE WINDOWS: There are multilevel degenerative changes throughout the thoracic and lumbar spine without osseous lesions concerning for infection or malignancy.
No CT evidence of cholecystitis or colitis.
Bilateral moderate pleural effusion, small amount of ascites and anasarca.
[**2173-5-30**]: CXR IMPRESSIONS: Unchanged moderate bilateral pleural effusions, with likely progressing multiple bilateral consolidations.
Given history of sepsis, locule of gas in the left retrocardiac region raises concern for loculated effusion or pulmonary cavitation.
No lung abscess or cavity.
Conventional radiographic abnormalities explained by a small area of aeration in the otherwise collapsed basal left lower lobe.
Moderate bilateral nonhemorrhagic pleural effusion, right greater than left, probably chronic given the relative high attenuation, responsible for substantial bibasilar atelectasis.
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and probable pulmonary hypertension.
Severe atherosclerotic plaque or mural thrombus, thoracic aorta, ulcerated at the level of the aortic arch.
Cholelithiasis and possible cholecystitis.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient admitted to SICU from outside hospital ICU for further managment of colitis and possible cholecystitis.
No GB wall thickening or [**2173-5-21**] HIDA: Mild delay bile transit time from liver to GB.
Negative for cystic or CBD obstruction.
Cardiovascular: Pt with [**Last Name (LF) 7792**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] depressions in anterolateral leads, troponin elevation 1.15->1.08-0.93.
She was continued on her antibiotic treatment for C. diff colitis (on Flagyl, oral vanco).
HIDA scan negative for cholecystitis.
Nutrition: DAT Renal: Cr 1.5, unclear baseline though patient with h/o nephropathy from DM.
Hematology: No acute issues.
Infectious disease: Originally treated with unasyn (and later switched to cipro) for possible cholecystitis however this was discontinued after imaging and further evaluation revealed no evidence fo cholecystitis.
Endocrine: DM2, hold glipizide, RISS goal BG >150  The patient was ruled out for cholecystitis clinically and on imaging.
Had likely troponin leak from possible CHF exacerbation in the setting of sepsis or hypovolemia (given the labs showed hemoconcentration).
We monitored pt on tele and she did not have any further episodes of chest pain while on the cardiology floor.
Pt was borderline hypokalemic on multiple occasions and was repleted with oral potassium.
Pt hasd HRs in the 80's so had room for increased BB.
# ID - pt has UA positive for yeast, consulted ID who recommended replacing the Foley and re-culturing from fresh Foley.
We completed this and the UA from the fresh foley was also positive for yeast and bacteria.
ID recommended starting a 3-day course of fluconazole, which pt got her first dose of [**2173-6-3**] and can be stopped after she gets her dose on [**2173-6-5**].
# Mental status changes.
Pt had some episodes of somnolence and confusion.
We investigated for possible causes of infection.
We did a CXR [**2173-5-31**] which showed a question of a lung consolidation, so we did a CT chest also [**2173-5-31**] which showed bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis.
She never spiked a fever with the mental status changes.
T2 DM - we put patient on an inpatient sliding scale and monitored BS regularly.
No hypoglycemic episodes or severe hypoglycemic episodes throughout admission.
Unclear the cause of anemia, possibly from GIB given dark looking stool or from chronic disease.
Lactate was 1.7 so less concerned for complication of ischemic bowel.
As pt's HCT is now stable but still low, will defer work-up of anemia to PCP.
Possibly due to recent hospitalization and difficult to manage DM according to patient, however on 2 occasions she said she wanted to die.
FEN - nutrition consult - heart healthy diabetic - f/u electrolytes and replete as necessary .
