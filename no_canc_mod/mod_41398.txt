IMPRESSION: Stable cardiomegaly with no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
There is edema within the superficial tissues of the calf.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
[**2194-5-6**] RUQ: The liver is diffusely echogenic, consistent with fatty infiltration or cirrhosis.
This study is severely limited due to body habitus and liver echogenicity.
There is no ascites.
IMPRESSION: Limited study with echogenic liver, consistent with fatty infiltration or cirrhosis; advanced liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
Lung volumes are markedly diminished.
There is resultant bronchovascular crowding at the lung bases and linear opacity at the right lung base in particular.
No focal consolidation or superimposed edema is noted.
No effusion or pneumothorax is noted.
Low lung volumes, with bronchovascular crowding.
No definite acute pulmonary process identified.
[**2194-5-6**] CT head: No acute intracranial process.
Again note is made of nonspecific low density bilaterally within internal capsules.
Brief Hospital Course: 42 year old female with history of EtOH abuse, depression, anxiety, and prior Reux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery admitted with encephalopathy and jaundice found to have alcoholic hepatitis, whose course has been c/b UTI, encephalopathy, and EtOH withdrawal.
# Alcoholic hepatitis: The patient presented with jaundice, AST>>ALT, and markedly elevated Tbili.
Viral hepatitis serologies were negative.
Prednisone was stopped on [**2194-5-15**] given new leukocytosis and fevers.
# Urinary tract infection: Initially a source of infection was unclear, so the patient was started on empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone, broadened to vanc/cefepime upon admission to the ICU.
# Encephalopathy: Likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy in the setting of alcoholic hepatitis and UTI.
No ascites on ultrasound for SBP.
No portal/splenic vein thrombosis.
# Elevated lactate: Patient with initial lactate 9 --> 2.8 with aggressive volume resuscitation.
She also initially had an anion gap lactic acidosis.
This was most likely secondary to alcoholic hepatitis and UTI.
# Alcohol withdrawal: Patient and family states she has had seizures in the past.
Social work was involved and set her up with [**Hospital 12091**] community health center where there is individual counseling and a structured relapse prevention program.
# Fever and leukocytosis: The patient developed fever and leukocytosis after alcoholic hepatitis was improving.
She was hemodynamically stable with the exception of persistent tachycardia.
She had no localizing signs or symptoms of infection.
LENI of the left leg was negative for DVT, with CXR without infiltrate.
Fever has resolved and leukocytosis is trending down now that steroids have been stopped.
# Megaloblastic Anemia: Possibly multifactorial with chronic liver disease, with poor marrow response and poor nutrition contributing.
The patient was guaiac positive, with INR 2.1 in the setting of decompensated liver disease and alcohol abuse.
The patient's hematocrit has intermittently been this low in the past.
Pneumoboots were used for DVT prophylaxis.
All sedating medications were held given hepatotoxicity or hepatic clearance including trazodone, zolpidem, and gabapentin.
# Depression: Emotionally labile, currently not on antidepressants.
# Left Leg Weakness: This is most likely secondary to alcohol, prolonged immobility, and deconditioning.
There was also an element of functional weakness as the patient was able to hold her leg up upon exam.
TSH slightly elevated but free T4 within normal limits.
