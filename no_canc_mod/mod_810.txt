Obstructive sleep apnea 15.
Appendectomy 16. h/o GI Bleed from AVMs with chronic need for iron replacement.
17. hypothyroidsm 18. hyperparathyroidism of renal disease   Social History: Patient lives in [**Location **], MA, with wife.
Son also has RV dysplasia .
Physical Exam: T 96.0, BP 104/60, HR 60, RR 22, O2sat 95% on 3L, FS 216 General: Pleasant obese male lying in bed in NAD Skin: several open sores on arms with dirty fingernails.
Could not assess JVD given body habitus, no cervical LAD appreciated.
CV: distant heart sounds, but RRR with 2/6 systolic murmur heard best at LUSB without radiation.
Lungs: bibasilar crackles; distant breath sounds at the right base.
No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi Abdomen: distended but still soft.
Extremities: very trace edema on left lower extremity.
peripheral vascular disease skin changes with erythema bilaterally.
Right knee with suprapatellar 3+ edema and beefy red erythema extending past patella.
Warm and mildly tender to touch.
ROM not fully tested secondary to discomfort.
Ammonia level elevated at 61, BNP 1242, vanco level [**2100-12-1**] was 5 .
Studies from OSH: [**2100-11-29**]: CXR 2 views: no pneumonia.
no evidence of CHF.
Small pleural effusion on lateral view.
[**2100-11-30**] VQ scan: low probability of PE .
ECHO (per d/c summary from OSH- no actually report with transfer papers) showed poor LV function with an EF of 30-35%.
Labs from [**Hospital1 18**]:  Micro:  staph aurea from prepatellar bursa x3  Brief Hospital Course: 70 yo M with multiple medical problems including RV dysplasia leading to right heart failure and chronic hepatic congestion, ESRD requiring dialysis, DM2 and an AMI.
#AMI: patient was asymptomatic but was found to have largely elevated troponins at the OSH.
This is was stopped secondary to bleeding.
Has tried BB in past but had symptomatic hypotension from it.
Has h/o GI bleed- so careful with anticoagulation.
He was placed on a 1L fluid restriction and a CXR on admission showed no evidence of fluid overload.
Given WBC and diff with bands and metamyl, concern for cellulitis.
Continued allopurinol and stopped colchicine secondary renal insufficiency.
It grew out Staph aureas which was MSSA.
Ortho was consulted for concern over a septic joint.
Despite pain in his knee, the patient was able to ambulate on the joint and it was believed the infection was not in the joint itself.
During the procedure he developed hypotension which continued in the PACU.
