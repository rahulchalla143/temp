Admission Date:  [**2127-1-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-1-31**]  Date of Birth:  [**2048-11-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: left sided weakness, lethargy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Amiodarone Infusion  History of Present Illness: Source : history is obtained from the patient's aide, [**Doctor First Name **].
Ms. [**Known lastname 9950**] is a 78 year old with a h/o stroke in [**2125**], afib on Coumadin, CAD s/p CABG x 2, hypertension, and diabetes, who presents from home with altered mental status.
She came back around noon, knocked on the door and there was no response.
She then became tachycardic to the 140s, wide complex, appearing to be SVT with abberancy.
She has some residual left sided weakness from the old stroke but has recovered well.
In the ED, she is complaining of some trouble breathing and some chest pain.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p CABG x 2 Bioprosthetic Mitral Valve Stroke in [**2125**] with left sided weakness treated at [**Hospital3 **] Diabetes   Social History: Lives independently and has an aid, [**Doctor First Name **], who comes to help her.
No masses or LAD.
No thyromegaly.
No carotid bruits.
No rebound or guarding.
No apraxia, no neglect.
Some weakness on the left but is antigravity.
Sensation: Withdraws to pain in all 4 extremities.
There is now apparent an acute infarct in the distribution of right middle cerebral artery involving the insular cortex and the right frontal lobe.
There is also involvement of the right temporal lobe seen anteriorly.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect seen.
No midline shift.
There is mild-to-moderate brain atrophy.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE NECK:  The CT angiography of the neck is slightly limited secondary to venous contamination.
There are markedly tortuous carotid and vertebral arteries noted.
There is no evidence of high-grade stenosis or occlusion seen in the carotid arteries and in the right vertebral artery.
CTA OF THE HEAD:  The CTA of the head demonstrates narrowing and tapering of the right middle cerebral artery near the bifurcation with diminished filling of the right sylvian branches.
These findings are consistent with occlusion or high-grade stenosis at this level.
The remaining arteries of the anterior and posterior circulation are patent without evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or an aneurysm.
Acute right middle cerebral artery infarct which has evolved since the previous CT of [**2127-1-24**].
Tortuous cervical, carotid and vertebral arteries without evidence of stenosis or occlusion.
High-grade stenosis and partial occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery near the bifurcation.
Patchy opacities at visualized both lung apices, correlation with chest plain film is recommended.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 9950**] is a 78 year old primarily Russian speaking woman with prior Right MCA infarct in [**2125**], afib on Coumadin, CAD s/p CABG x 2 with bioprosthetic mitral valve, s/p pacemaker, hypertension, and diabetes, who presented from home with altered mental status.
She was found to have a new right MCA infarction.
1) Right MCA infarction- Her examination at presenation revealed worsened left sided weakness, new left UMN facial droop, right gaze deviation, and possible eye opening apraxia.
A CT confirmed new R MCA territory infarct.
MRI could not be performed due to patient's cardiac pacemaker.
The likely etiology of her stroke was cardioembolic due to subtherapeutic INR of 1.9 at presentation.
There was no echo evidence for intracardiac source of emboli.
CTA head and neck revealed high grade right MCA stenosis and partial occlusion.
Her carotid and vertebral arteries were tortuous without evidence for occlusion or stenosis.
Given her stroke was likely due to subtherapeutic INR, her new goal INR should be 3-3.5.
2) Rapid Atrial fibrillation with aberrancy- Patient was started on Amiodarone drip for rate/rhythm control as she has a marked tachyarrhthmia on presentation with development of likely secondary pulmonary edema and hypoxia.
Her oxygen requirement improved and she was transferred to the neurology step down unit for further care.
3) Dysphagia- Initially kept NPO, then seen by speech and swallow therapists.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute Right Middle Cerebral Artery Infarction Atrial Fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Slight left sided neglect.
Left Arm > leg weakness.
Left Upper motor neuron facial droop.
Call your doctor or 911 if you experience any new weakness, tingling, numbness, difficulty speaking, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other concerning symptoms.
