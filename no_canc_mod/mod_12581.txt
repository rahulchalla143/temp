Starting at 11PM last night, She intermittently has chest pain, but this pain is worse since 11PM last over the past 2 hours.
She was at her baseline level of shortness of breath.

Cough productive of yellow sputum and has been ongoing for weeks, no acute change.
No change in recent albuterol use.
Lightheaded when standing but otherwise no lightheadedness, dizziness, recent falls or syncope.
She felt that she probably had pneumonia or a PE so she came to the ED.
She had coarse rhochi on the right and reduced air movement bilaterally.
During the exam patient becoming more confused and BP dropped to 80s/30s remained low consistently.
A RIJ CVL was placed and NE was started due to concern for septic shock.
Given her history of recurrent PE's she underwent CTA which showed acute PE's in the segmental anterior and posterior segments of the right superior lobar artery, also LLL infiltrate.
She was not started on anticoagulation because of a documented "Heparin and Lovenox allergy" which was GI bleed in the setting of receiving Heparin for her previous PE's when she has active colitis.
Given her hypotension requiring pressors, she was admitted to the MICU.
Still has [**6-16**] chest discomfort and is asking for pain medications.

[**2112-3-18**] LENIs No evidence of DVT.
Limited assessment of the calf veins  [**2112-3-19**] TTE The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax demonstrated on the current examination.
It might reflect interval improvement of pulmonary infarct.
Alternatively, it could be less prominent due to different rotation of the patient.
No evidence for intra-abdominal malignancy.
Ventral wall abdominal hernia containing a loop of transverse colon without evidence for proximal obstruction.
Air in the bladder may be a result of recent catheterization and clinical correlation recommended.
Brief Hospital Course: BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE 69yo female with COPD, ulcerative colitis, diverticulosis s/p partial colectomy, and 2 PE's in the past on chronic Warfarin with IVC filter who presented to the ED for chest pain and was found to have PEs and pneumonia  --Active issues--  #Pulmonary embolus: Ms. [**Known lastname **] has h/o 2 PEs in past and had IVC filter placed in [**2106**].
She has had an extensive hypercoag workup in the past which was unrevealing, however she has some degree of hypercoaguability by nature of having ulcerative colitis.
TTE was performed which showed normal EF and no evidence of right heart dysfunction.
CT abd/pelvis showed no evidence of abdominal or pelvic malignancy but noted thrombus in the IVC filter.
Her PE's are small, with no evidence of RV dysfunction/strain and no cardiac biomarker elevation, so her PE is an unlikely cause for the hypotension.
Similarly, no other obvious signs of sepsis to explain hypotension.
Her Lasix and atenolol were initially held, Lasix restarted with no hypotension.
#Chest pain: Left-sided pleuritic pain may be related to LLL PNA.
Initially, the pain was not classic for ischemia and troponin was negative.
She was ruled out for MI and her pain was treated with Tylenol and Morphine/Vicodin.
She had two additional episodes of crushing chest pain (noted to be different and separate from her initial pleuritic pain) on the floor with no acute EKG changes and an unremarkable CXR.
All EKGs this admission show Q waves in the inferior leads which were not present on her prior EKGs from many years ago.
#Community Acquired PNA: No fevers but leukocytosis and LLL infiltrate suggested PNA.
She had been given Vanc/Levo in the ED, but she has no recent hospitalizations and will receive treatment for CAP.
#Leg edema: Patient reports history of CHF, but EF was normal on echo this admission.
Her edema worsened somewhat after holding her Lasix.
Other potential causes for her leg edema include thrombus that was noted over her IVC filter or chronic venous insufficiency from recurrent DVT in her LEs over many years.
