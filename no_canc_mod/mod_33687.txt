[**Known lastname 83147**] is a very nice 73 year-old woman with prior history of PAFib on coumadin, s/p PPM, with myocardial bridge s/p stend and bleeding 2 weeks ago who comes with SOB and was found to hve pericardial effusion and tamponade now s/p pericardiosentesis.
Patient was in her prior state of health and had a "check up" and was found to have an abnormal perfusion in the anterio-apical region.
Then, she underwent cardiac cath that showed myocardial bridge 2 weeks ago; she was stented and then started with bleeding.
Balloon was inflated for 10 minutes and no further bleeding was reported.
Then, she flew to [**Location (un) 86**] from [**Location (un) 2848**] 2 days after the procedure and was very active, but 3 days ago started noticing shortness of breath on excertion.
Patient denies any orthopnea, PND, chest pain.
The shortness of breath kept progressive until today morning where she was unable to take a deep breath and went to the ER of [**Hospital1 **].
She had an echocardiogram done that showed a poericardial effusion with 3cm surrounding all faces of heart; there were signs of tamponade.
Given the posibility of bleeding through the myocardial bridge that was stented she was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
IMPRESSION: Large, circumferential pericardial effusion with evidence of tamponade physiology.
Both ventricles are small secondary to external compression.
Post-pericardiosentesis Echocardiogram: Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Small residual effusion located anterior to the right ventricle.
No echo evidence of tamponade.
The right and left ventricles are normal in size and there is no tamponade.
Echocardiogram [**2186-8-25**]: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Trivial residual pericardial effusion.
Large pleural effusions.
Echocardiogram [**2186-8-28**]: There is a promient partially echofilled anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
There is a prominent left pleural effusion.
EKG: Atrial fibrillation with variable ventricular conduction and a ventricular heart rate of 80 BPM.
Marked cardiomegaly with marked homogeneous opacification of the left hemithorax, presumably, due to a large pleural effusion.
On the right, no evidence of pneumonia or overhydration.
[**Known lastname 83147**] is a very nice 73 year-old woman with prior history of PAFib on coumadin, s/p PPM, with myocardial bridge s/p stent and bleeding 2 weeks ago who comes with SOB, pericardial effusion and tamponade.
Pericardial Effusion - Patient with myocardial bridge and stent 2 weeks ago complicated with bleeding requiring baloon tamponade.
She traveled from [**State 108**] to [**Location (un) 86**] and started noticing shortness of breath that worsened throughout the days until the day of her admission at OSH.
Pt was given 10 mg of PO vitamin K. She had an echocardiogram showing global pericardial effusion without apparent loculations of 3 cm and signs of tamponade.
Patient was transfered to our Medical Center for pericardiosentesis given that OSH did not have cardiac surgery in case it was needed for bleeding from myocardial bridge and stent.
On admission here patient had signs of tamponade on echocardiogram and was taken to the cardiac cath lab.
There were no malignant cells.
There was minimal drainage throughout the pericardial drain ant it was pulled 24 hours after insertion without complications.
Serial echocardiograms showed minimal ammount of fluid, but a mass in apex that most-likely represents a clot, but cannot rule out fat pad (to big and distal make it unlikely).
However, given patient's recent bleed and history she is at high risk for restrictive/constrictive physiology and constrictive pericarditis in the future.
Patient had bilateral pleural effusion (L>>>R) with bibasilary atelectases that improved throughout admission.
Thoracic surgery was consulted regarding her clot and effusion and suggested conservative management.
She was able to tell us and manifest her full understanding of the risk of shortness of breath, recurring bleed, constrictive pericarditis requiring surgery in the near-future.
Her CHADS2 score is 1 having a ~2% annual risk of stroke, which would be similar to the risk of bleeding with a therapeuric anticoagulation and even higher in supra-therapeutic range.
However, given her rencet bleeding into his pericardium with tamponade and recent procedure, we decided to hold anticogaulation for now and resume once her pericardial issues are resolved.
Patient is in aspirin and plavix, which are not as good a warfarin, but less risk of bleeding as she did this time.
She was rate-controlled with her home-dose Digoxin 0.25 mg PO DAILY and her Diltiazem Extended-Release was increased to 240 mg PO DAILY given she was having RVR in the setting of atrial irritation after pericardial bleeding.
CAD - Patient with not known CAD, myocardial bridge s/p stent and bleeding as above.
She had questionable allergy to aspirin, but patient stated anaphylaxis to Alka-Seltzer.
Given the superiority of aspirin for coronary artery disease and stents, she underwent aspirin de-sensitation in the ICU.
No need for ACEI/[**Last Name (un) **] or beta-blocker at this time given no CAD, normal EF.
Pump - Patient with no signs of heart failure on exam or echo.
Dyslipidemia - Continuing pt pravastatin as above.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Pericardial effusion Pleural Effusion Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response Coronary Artery Disease   Discharge Condition: stable.
Discharge Instructions: You had some blood in the lining around your heart called a pericardial effusion.
However, there is a residual blood clot remaining that may be causing inflammation and leading to fluid buildup in your lungs called a pleural effusion on the left side.
Cartia Xt was increased to 240 mg daily 2.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] if you have any increased shortness of breath, chest pain, persistant palpitations, pain when you take a deep breath, dizziness or fainting, or any other unusual symptoms.
