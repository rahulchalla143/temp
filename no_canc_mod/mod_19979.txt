Mild elevation in PCW .
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and infero-lateral akinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
RLE US: IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis in right common femoral, superficial femoral, or popliteal veins.
L Hip plain film: FINDINGS: No evidence of bone or joint space abnormality   Brief Hospital Course: # Coronary artery disease: Patient is status post an inferoposterior STEMI.
Pt had transvenous pacer placed for total heart block peri-MI at outside hospital.
After admission, patient was doing well and without evidence of arrhythmia for the duration of his hospitalization.
Likely secondary to stunned myocardium.
# Rhythm: Patient had VT arrest as well as complete heart block prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Also noted to have Mobitz type I.
A temporary transvenous pacer was placed prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 **] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 75601**], and was subsequently discontinued as he showed no further signs of heart block.
Initially was in atrial fibrillation at admission, though spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm.
No prior history of afib.
These were likely secondary to reperfusion dysrhythmias in the setting of his inferoposterior MI.
# Anemia/GI bleed: Hct initially 38 at OSH, was falling on admission with episode of coffee ground emesis while still intubated.
GI was consulted, however, patient's hematocrit stabilized and he did not have any further episodes.
# Valves: No evidence of valvular disease.
Trivial MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] but no audible murmur.
He was extubated on his second day of admission without complication and had no further respiratory issues.
# Musculoskeletal: Patient with complaints of R calf pain that started since admission.
Likely [**1-2**] bruise from leg immobilization on admission due to venous sheath.
Also with complaints of L hip pain, chronic.
L hip X-ray negative for bone or joint space abnormality.
Release 24 hr Oral   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Inferoposterior STEMI   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after having a heart attack.
It is very important that you have a stress test in the next two weeks to further evaluate your coronary arteries.
If you develop any increased burping, episodes of flushing, chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms that concern you, please contact your doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 10836**] to the nearest Emergency Room as soon as possible.
