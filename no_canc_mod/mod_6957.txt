The next day he [**Last Name (un) 4996**] noticing dark stools and gradually became lightheaded and weak over the next 2 days.
He also felt nauseous and had poor po intake.
He denies abdominal pain.

Erythema in the stomach (gastritis).
No active bleeding site found.
SUMMARY & RECOMMENDATIONS: Summary: Sub-optimal bowel prep with a moderate amount of food debris in the stomach and jejunum.
Mild gastritis with two angioectasias in the proximal jejunum.
No active bleeding site found.
Recommendations: Follow up with the PCP (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 410**]) and consider a small bowel enteroscopy.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year-old man with a PMH of CAD (s/p CABG and multiple PCIs) on aspirin, aortic valve replacement on coumadin, dCHF who presents with chest pain, lightheadedness and melena found to have HCT of 19.1 transferred to MICU for GI bleed.
Pt was in stable condition so transferred to cardiology service where he underwent EGD, colonoscopy, and small capsule study without evidence of active bleed.
Pt subsequently had fevers [**2047-12-7**] to 102 and evidence on CXray of LLL pna.
# GI Bleed/Anemia: Pt had lightheadedness, chest pain, melanotic stools, and a HCT of 19 on [**12-2**] admission with ED noting heme positive stool.
EGD, colonoscopy, and small capsule study were negative for active bleeding source although small capsule study did reveal two angioectasias in the jejunum.
Hypothetically, in the setting of an elevated INR while on aspirin and plavix, the patient may have bled from this site which resolved at the time of study.
GI bleed likely resulted in iron deficiency anemia as the patient's labs were mostly consistent with this--a microcytic anemia with low ferritin, low iron, low % transferrin saturation, hypochromatic cells with the presence of ovalocytes.
The patient can take TID if the constipating effects aren't limiting as patient does have history of constipation and is already taking opiates.
Also of note, the patient had a mildly elevated indirect bilirubin, although it is unclear what the cause of this is--however, it was only found after transfusion as was the presence of schistocytes; thus there may have been some low level intravascular hemolysis present post-RBC transfusion.
Notably, the patient's LDH and haptoglobin were normal on admission, making it extremely unlikely the patient was undergoing any sort of hemolysis at presentation.
Furthermore, urine hemoglobin and hemosiderin were negative further aruging against intravascular hemolysis.
Coombs test was negative strongly arguing against extravascular hemolysis.
Plavix was stopped since patient's last stent was placed in [**2130**] and risk of bleeding while also on coumadin and aspirin outweighs benefit of preventing stent thrombosis in someone with a stent placed four years ago.
Pt will be followed by GI as outpatient with potential small bowel enteroscopy.
# Pneumonia - Patient became febrile to 102 degrees on [**12-8**] and continued to spike on [**12-9**] with cxrays x2 demonstrating LLL pneumonia.
The pt had no cough, adventitious sounds on physical exam, or elevated white count and his only symptom was fever.
However, because blood and urine cultures were negative and cxray was suggestive of pna, the patient was initially started on HAP with vancomycin and cefepime before transitioning to PO levofloxacin, which he was discharged on after he was afebrile on this for >24 hours.
Coumadin was held while pt had GI bleed and was restarted after EGD/Colonscopy and stabilization of HCT.
#Angina/ CAD: Patient has extensive cardiac history including prior CABG and multiple PCIs, aortic valve repair, last intervention in [**2130**] who now has chronic angina.
The acute exacerbation of his angina on presentation was likely related to demand from anemia in the setting of his GI bleed.
His chest pain diminished with an increased HCT.
Plavix was stopped since the patient's last stent was in [**2130**], his reocclusions with stents have been from restenosis (neointimal) and not actual thrombotic (platelet-driven) events, his CAD is stable, and the risk of bleeding is too great for the benefit offered by plavix in this setting.
# Chronic dCHF:  Pt was mildly volume overloaded in the MICU and was restarted on his home diuretics with good effect.
He did have wide pulse pressures likely [**1-19**] to anemia.
# Elevated indirect bili: Likely from low-level hemolysis, possibly intravascular given presence of schistiocytes post transfusion.
Gilberts is another possibility although this wouldn't cause the presence of schistiocytes and would be unusual in someone with CAD.
# Mildly elevated AST: Only occurred x1.
Follow up with GI for possible push enteroscopy.
Monitor pts INR as pt seems to have GI bleeding tendency when INR is supratherapeutic.
Monitor for resolution of elevated AST.
Outpatient [**Hospital1 **] Work Please have your INR drawn on Monday [**12-12**] Please have your INR and HCT drawn on Wednesday [**12-14**]  Please have these results faxed to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 410**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 18702**] 3. pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
Ativan 1 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO twice a day as needed for anxiety.
21. cyclobenzaprine 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for back pain.
You were admitted for chest pain accompanied by black stools, weakness, and lightheadedness.
Your HCT was 19 on admission and you were found to have a Gastrointestinal bleed.
A colonoscopy, upper endoscopy and small capsule study were conducted which revealed abnormal blood vessel dilations in the proximal jejunum but no sites of active bleeding.
You developed fevers as high as 102 which resolved with antibiotics.
The only source that we have found is a chest x ray concerning for left sided pneumonia.
The following changes were made to your medications: Started levofloxacin for pneumonia Started pantoprazole for GI bleed Started iron pills for anemia Stopped plavix Your Celexa was increased to 30mg daily  Followup Instructions: Department: DIV.
