In the Emergency Department she passed a total of 1 liter of bright red blood per rectum and was given intravenous Protonix and normal saline times 2 liters.
She was seen by GI who recommended nasogastric lavage, but the patient's daughter declined any interventions such as no nasogastric tube and no colonoscopy.
She had no further episodes of rebleeding while in the Intensive Care Unit.
Bilateral inguinal hernia repair.
Squamous cell carcinoma status post right leg excision.
Left hepatic lobe cyst in [**2176**] seen on CT.
Bright red blood per rectum in [**2187-5-29**] seen in the Emergency Department with a stable hematocrit and sent home.
History of high hematocrits, which is to her knowledge never worked up.
Could have potentially polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].
Received a CT scan, which showed right trochanteric bursitis.
She also had a urinary tract infection at this time treated with Levofloxacin.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No alcohol or tobacco.
HEENT she has dry mucous membranes.
Anicteric sclera.
No elevated JVP appreciated.
Chest she had some rales at the right base.
Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm with a 3 out of 6 systolic murmur at the apex.
Belly is soft, nontender and nondistended.
Rectal examination brown stool, positive external hemorrhoids and guaiac positive.
No bright red blood per rectum at this time.
Appears to have a mild left face droop, which the daughter states is old and she is moving all of her extremities.
She also developed a leukocytosis peaking at 16.6, with 87 percent neutrophils and no bands, 7 percent lymphocytes.
She had a chest x-ray, which showed an infiltration in the right lower lobe and compression of the left lower lobe.
Her hematocrit never    dropped below 44, however, she has an elevated hematocrit    at baseline.
She did have a 10 point hematocrit drop.
Her blood pressure became hypertensive to    the 70s to 190s and her antihypertensives were restarted.
The etiology of this bleed has not been    determined given that the daughter's wishes to not have    any invasive measures such as colonoscopy or nasogastric    tube.
She has a questionable history of diverticula,    although cannot rule out AVM or cancer.
She had no    rebleeding after her bleed in the Emergency Department.
Community acquired pneumonia:  Given her leukocytosis and    right lower lobe infiltrates on chest x-ray treatment with    Levofloxacin was begun and she should continue for seven    days.
She had been on this    medication before in the past and was somehow discontinued    monitoring her blood pressure.
Acute renal failure:  Her creatinine was elevated and her    urine output decreased likely secondary to her prerenal    state.
