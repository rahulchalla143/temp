woman with PMH of T1-T2 paraplegia, frequent admissions for PNA and UTI, and COPD (on 1.5-2L NC at home), who presented with acute mental status changes and changes in her breathing status.
She denied noticing any increase in cough, SOB, dysuria, incontinence, or cloudy urine over the past few days.
[**Last Name (STitle) 665**] who noted that he would not be prescribing her narcotics anymore since he felt her burning lower extremity pain was neuropathic in nature, not c/w her pain from her vehicle accident, and would be better treated w/ gabapentin rather than narcotics.
# Recurrent pneumonia (followed by pulm - Last [**2149-4-9**]) - Per pulm, recurrent pneumonia likely from pulmonary toilet issues secondary to neuromuscular disease with improvement with consistent and aggressive bronchopulmonary therapy.
- Prior sputum cultures + for MRSA, pan-sensitive Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas.

PERTINENT IMAGING: pCXR [**2150-8-11**] FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The patient is slightly rotated.
The heart is mildly enlarged.
The central pulmonary vessels are engorged, and mild pulmonary edema is present.
There is a new right base opacity concerning for consolidation.
There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
Old right-sided rib fractures are present.
New right basilar opacity may represent a consolidation.
Unchanged mild cariomegaly, pulmonary vascular congestion, and interstitial edema.
woman with history of T1/T2 paraplegia s/p MVA, frequent PNA/UTIs who presented with unresponsiveness and apnea requiring mechanical ventilation and was found to have a RLL pneumonia and proteus UTI, complicated by altered mental status associated with sedating medications as well as septic shock requiring pressors in the MICU.
CXR on admission with RLL opacity highly suspicious for aspiration pneumonia or pre-existing pneumonia.
Patient requiried intubation and mechanical ventilation in the MICU this admission due to persistent unresponiveness and hypoxia on admission after transient response to narcan.
If pneumonia were pre-existing, most likely culprit would be strep pneumo, but if aspiration pneumonia then respiratory distress likely [**3-5**] pneumonitis, with polymicrobial infection possibly prevented with 8 day course of Vancomycin/Meropenem, recieved four days of ciprofloxacin.
Sputum cultures grew staph aureus, possibly reflective of infection vs. colonization.
-Blood cultures from [**8-15**] and [**2150-8-18**] pending at time of discharge  #) Proteus mirabilis UTI: On [**2150-7-30**] she had cloudy urine and increased incontinence for which she was given a 7-day course of Bactrim for what was found to be a Klebsiella UTI.
Patient self-catheterizes at home and has had recurrent multidrug-resistant UTIs.
UA on admission showed large leuks, neg nitrites and she was started on meropenem for empric [**Year (4 digits) 40097**] coverage, though [**Year (4 digits) **] eventually grew >100k CFU of meropenem-sensitive proteus mirabilis  #) Hypotension: She was normotensive in the ED but became hypotensive to SBPs in the 80s while in the MICU soon after admission.
She developed a fever to 102.1F and also was found to have a Proteus UTI (>100K) on [**Last Name (LF) 21574**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she had a possible urosepsis picture.
Her hypotension resolved as she clinically improved from her UTI and was able to be extubated.
She was occasionally hyPERtensive on the regular medical floor to SBP 160s-170s but asymptomatic, likely due to anxiety, as improved with decreased anxiety.
#) AMS: Per witness, patient became lethargic/unresponsive after dinner after an episode of vomiting following administration of PO clonazepam.
AMS likely due to over-sedation with medications given timing of medication administration, Utox positive for methadone, as well as bradypnea and transient response to narcan on presentation.
Urosepsis and hypotension may have also played a role in AMS.
-Careful monitoring of polypharamcy with multiple sedating medications -Adherence to narcotics agreement and appointment at pain clinic   CHRONIC ISSUES: # COPD/ Chronic Hypercarbia: On 2L O2 at home.
Was on 3L NC at time of discharge likely secondary to recent pneumonia.
-Continue to week to baseline O2 requirment -Encourage smoking cessation (restarted 2wk prior to admission)  #)Chronic Pain: Foot and shoulder pain related to prior MVA and likely neuropathy.
-Rescheduled pain clinic appointment (missed during admission)  #)Urinary Retention: Patient usually self-catheterizes at home but foley catheter used during admission extending past period needed for UOP monitoring because of patient request.
# Anemia of chronic disease: Her baseline Hct~28.
# Constipation: Continued on home polyethylene glycol  # Anxiety/Depression: Continued on citalopram, clonazepam and trazodone restarted when mental status improved.
# Hypothyroidism:  Continued levothyroxine  # Hypercholesterolemia: Continued simvastatin  # Hep C: Stable, no current treatment, no LFT abnormalities this admission.
# GERD: Continued omeprazole  Transitional issues for this patient: -Pain management -Sterile straight cath teaching for patient given recurrent UTIs -Consider outpatient speech and swallow evaluation given suspicion for recurrent aspiration pneumonias  Medications on Admission: 1. albuterol NEB Q6hr PRN dyspnea 2. baclofen 20 mg Qam, 10 mg 4PM, 20 mg Qpm 3. citalopram 40 mg PO DAILY 4. ipratropium Q6hr PRN dyspnea 5. levothyroxine 112 mcg PO DAILY 6. clonazepam 1 mg PO TID PRN (takes 2 mg QHS) 7. lidocaine patch - feet and shoulder blade 8. omeprazole 20 mg [**Hospital1 **] 9. oxybutynin chloride 10 mg Qam, 5 mg 4pm, 10mg QHS 10.Polyethylene Glycol 17g QD 11.gabapentin 600 mg TID 12.simvastatin 10 mg PO DAILY 13.sucralfate 1 gram TID 14.trazodone 100 mg QHS PRN anxiety.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted for increased oxygen requirement and decreased responsiveness, and a breathing tube was placed for a machine to help you breathe.
A chest xray showed a pneumonia in your right lung and a urine study showed a urinary tract infection.
