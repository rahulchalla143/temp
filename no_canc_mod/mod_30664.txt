She initially presented with fever to 101 after HD on [**1-10**] treated with 650mg of Tylenol at rehab, rechecked at 101.3, and noted have some chills by the nurse.
She denies any N/V, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, rhinnorhea, or abdominal pain.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted on [**3-11**] for VRE Bacteremia and was treated with Linezolid for a planned 4 week course; she subsequently had her HD lined removed, underwent a line holiday and then a new line was placed.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia with flattening laterally.
She was given 2L IVF and Vanc/Imipenem for empiric coverage of an unclear source given her history.
Her hypotension resolved with IVF.
She remained afebrile with stable vital signs.

The differential was broad including line infection (new HD line placed on [**12-31**]), pneumonia (CXR without obvious infiltrate), CMV Viremia (viral load [**12-29**] negative), UTI, C. Diff (recent infection [**11-5**] but without any symptoms to suggest this).
Patient will need to complete 4 week course of Daptomycin for VRE bacteremia in setting of known thrombus that is possibly seeded.
# T Wave Inversions: Patient's T waves were upright at the time of admission.
The ddx included: ischemia, Takotsubo's, or a cerebral processes, however rapid resolution of the T waves made the later two less likely.
She denied chest discomfort though she occasionally had nausea.
Patient has no LVH on prior ECHOs to invoke repolarization changes.
Recommend performing persantine study to r/o ischemia as an outpatient, not initiated as an inpatient given difficulty to instigate intervention in this setting with recent bacteremia and RUE thrombus.
# Tachycardia: In addition to atrial fibrillation which is currently controlled, she had multiple episodes of regular tachycardia.
EKG revealed sinus tach.
In terms of the etiologies of sinus tachycardia, she had evidence of volume depletion, especially after HD, which likely led to low systolic blood pressures in the 90s and sinus tachycardia.
Sinus tachycardia invariably improved/resolved after gentle IVF (250cc-500cc NS).
She also experienced nausea during some episodes of tachycardia, raising the question whether the tachycardia is due to discomfort.
# Low Blood Pressure: Patient's baseline systolic blood pressure is 100s to 110s, though was noted to occasionally be in the 90s, which responded to small IVF boluses (250-300cc).
It was thought to be secondary to volume shifts and possibly be exacerbated by autonomic instability.
# ESRD on HD s/p failed transplant: Patient was continued on HD and maintained on Prednisone.
# Venous thrombus: Patient was noted to have a complete thrombosis of the left AV [**Month/Year (2) **], left cephalic vein and left subclavian  vein, and partial thrombosis of left brachiocephalic vein with extension to SVC on her previous admission.
She was maintained on warfarin with goal [**12-31**] and should continue anticoagulation until resolution of the thrombus or indefinitely.
# CMV viremia: Patient has been treated with valganciclovir.
This was briefly stopped out of concern for myelosuppression but subsequently restarted per ID.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  On [**1-13**] patient was transferred to MICU for afib with RVR and hypotension.
# Nausea: Patient had repeated bouts of nausea accompanied by tachycardia in the 120-140 and hypotension that resolved with ondansetron.
This appears to occur after HD and may be related to volume depletion.
She also often gets nausea after eating.
Patient repeatedly denied SOB or chest discomfort.

You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] because of fever and hypotension.
You were then found to have a type of arrhythmia called "atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response".
You were treated for atrial fibrillation with two medications, digoxin and metoprolol.
