ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient's renal function had resolved and remained normal.
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  It was felt that the patient did not demonstrate systolic heart failure.
The patient did well throughout the remainder of his course with mild diuresis with Lasix.
HEMATURIA ISSUES:  The patient completed a 10-day course for a urinary tract infection.
His hematuria resolved and was felt to be secondary to his heparin drip and likely Foley catheter trauma.
Urine cytology incidentally came back as atypical and could not exclude urothelial dysplasia/neoplasia and will need to follow up on this with his primary care provider.
ANTICOAGULATION ISSUES:  The patient stayed in the hospital for a Coumadin bridge to a therapeutic level for his mechanical mitral valves and was discharged after his INR was 2.4 to 2.5 for 48 hours.
