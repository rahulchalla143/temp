He was intubated in the field was converted out of VF with 1 shock, then transported to [**Hospital6 **] where he was given lidocaine 100mg x 1 in the ED and started on amiodarone drip.
His cardiac enzymes were negative and his electrolytes were not derranged; His other labs were simply notable for a low hct of 27.1. .
He then had another VT event which was resolved by repeat lidocaine bolus and increasing drip to 3mg.
Past Medical History: #HTN # dilated CMP with EF 40-45% in setting of AFib; last EF 60% # atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion in [**2151**] and [**2153**] # 1st degree AV block; symptomatic bradycardia on atenolol # tonsillar CA s/p 3x cisplatin and XRT (finished [**12-22**]) # peripheral neuropathy # diabetes type 2 non-insulin-dependent; c/b peripheral neuropathy and toe amputations; chronic venous insufficiency with chronic LE cellulitis # recent tonsillar CA ?currently undergoing chemo/XRT?

Opens eyes to command CV: RRR no m/r/g; decreased heart sounds Pulm: clear anteriorly Abd: obese, s/nd/nt + BS, PEG in place (non-functional Ext: B chronic venous changes, trace edema B   Pertinent Results: EP study showed scar and many foci were ablated with some success, but residual foci.
cardiac cath had LAD stenosis and bare metal stent was placed.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P 58 yo with PMH significant for morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation, tonsillar CA s/p chemo/XRT, found down with ventricular fibrillation with several episodes of recurrent VT s/p VT ablation.
Rhythm: Pt with VF and recurrent monomorphic VT (RBBB superior morphology).
Changed to an altered morphology and some polymorphic variation s/p 1x ablation.
EP study on [**1-14**]- Several different morphologies of VT were noted, generally not well-tolerated hemodynamically which limited the ability to map the arrhythmia.
Post-ablation, the pt continued to have occasional episodes of VT including poorly tolerated spells.
Many of these were associated with increased catecholamine states such as reducing the amount of sedatives he was receiving but they did not well respond to increased beta blockade.
BEcause of the concern re: ischemia contributing to the episodes of arrhythmia, the pt underwent cardiac catheterization (see below).
Agressive resuscitative measures were performed but the pt had persistent and recurrent arrhythmia that was not hemodynamically tolerated and did not respond to repeated attempts at defibrillation.
ECG during brief sinus rhythm during code did not demonstrate ST elevation or any evidence of acute stent thrombosis.
CAD: Reduced EF, and findings at EP study consistent with CAD (regional scar), although cardiac enzymes persistantly negative.
Pump: LVEF now 30% with 1-2+MR and mild PAH.
# Altered mental status: likely was ICU/sedation induced delirium.
Head CT without bleed or infarct.
# Infection: Patient had E. coli UTI which was treated with 7day ceftriaxone.
# Diarrhea: Likely secondary to antibiotics.
# Respiratory failure: Intubated and extubated during hospitalization.
# Tonsillar Cancer: tonsillar CA s/p 3x cisplatin ([**2155-11-3**], [**2155-11-24**], [**2155-12-15**]) and XRT (finished [**12-22**]).
# Pressure ulcers: 2 small spots on back and under pannus which do not look infected.
