Admission Date:  [**2136-3-28**]       Discharge Date:  Date of Birth:   [**2103-7-16**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 38403**] is a 32-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy (viral versus idiopathic) and ventricular arrhythmia who was admitted to the hospital because of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator firing; then subsequently transferred to Coronary Care Unit for congestive heart failure.
Mr. [**Known lastname 38404**] dilated cardiomyopathy was first diagnosed in [**2132**]/[**2132**] when he developed upper respiratory infection with persistent symptoms resulting in persistent dyspnea and fluid retention.
A workup of these symptoms led to the diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy.
He denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea but does report dyspnea on exertion with one flight of stairs.
In [**2136-1-10**], he had a syncopal episode and was found to be in ventricular tachycardia and had an automatic internal cardioverter-defibrillator placed.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**3-23**] for an electrophysiology study which showed multiple fossae of ventricular tachycardia which were not able to be mapped and ablated because he tolerated this study poorly and required cardioversion.
After his electrophysiology study he was transferred to the CMI Service, but had an episode of more than 30 beats of ventricular tachycardia with subsequent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator firing; override pacing failed.
His lidocaine was subsequently discontinued and replaced with mexiletine with poor results.
He was also started on Coumadin for a poor ejection fraction.
An echocardiogram on the same day showed an ejection fraction of less than 15%, moderate dilation of the left atrium, biventricular dilation, and severe biventricular hypokinesis.
Dilated cardiomyopathy diagnosed in [**2132**] to [**2133**]; class II heart failure (details as above in History of Present Illness).
History of frequency ventricular tachycardia, sustained.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Father with cardiomyopathy and heart transplant; passed away in [**2133**] from pulmonary toxicity secondary to amiodarone.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   No fevers, chills, cough, abdominal or urinary complaints.
Has significant anxiety about recent event.
In general, a well-developed, well-nourished, appeared somewhat anxious, in no acute distress.
Neck revealed jugular venous pulse 9 mc.
A 2/6 systolic murmur maximal at the sternal border, as third heart sound is present.
No hepatosplenomegaly, and no masses, normal active bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed 1+ pitting edema bilaterally to the midshin, cool foot, barely palpable distal pulses.
A milrinone drip was started with subsequent increase in cardiac output and a decrease in his pulmonary artery and wedge pressures.
However, the patient experienced frequent supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia on the milrinone, and on one occasion had an episode of ventricular tachycardia resulting in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator firing as well as loss of consciousness (transiently).
Therefore, the milrinone was discontinued, and the strategy of therapy was changed to maximizing the diuresis and afterload reduction.
Anticoagulation for a poor ejection fraction which had been started on the floor had been held for the Swan-Ganz catheter placement but was restarted with a heparin drip and Coumadin in the unit.
ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY:  The patient with frequent episodes of ventricular tachycardia, status post multiple antiarrhythmic regimens on the floor; finally controlled well quinidine.
However, after milrinone was initiated, the patient had recurrent supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia necessitating the cessation of milrinone drip (as detailed above).
PSYCHIATRY:  The patient with significant and understandable anxiety over recent events.
CARDIAC TRANSPLANT EVALUATION:  The patient had serologies and 24-hour urine collection, appropriate radiologic studies, and cardiac catheterization performed during this hospitalization in an anticipation of cardiac transplant.
NOTE:  The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, as well as discharge medications, and plans for discharge, followup, and transplant evaluation will be dictated in a Discharge Summary Addendum.
