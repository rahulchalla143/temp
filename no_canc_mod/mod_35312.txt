2) Prominent aortic valve calcification.
3) 2-mm lingular nodule; if patient has a history of smoking or other lung cancer risk factors, this could be reassessed in one year's time, otherwise no follow up recommended, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 8773**] Society guidelines.
4) A few scattered calcified pleural plaques, the sequela of remote asbestos exposure, with basilar subpleural reticulation, greater at the right base, suggestive of possible early fibrotic changes.
Increased perihilar airspace opacities and small bilateral pleural effusions are present.
Right basilar atelectasis may be slightly improved.
No pneumothorax detected.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic root.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

A CTA revealed prominent aortic valve calcification, a 2-mm lingular nodule; if patient has a history of smoking or other lung cancer risk factors, this could be reassessed in one year's time, otherwise no follow up recommended, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 8773**] Society guidelines and a few scattered calcified pleural plaques, the sequela of remote asbestos exposure, with basilar subpleural reticulation, greater at the right base, suggestive of possible early fibrotic changes.
She had several episodes of hypotension which responded to fluid and albumin.
As she had a slightly enlarged cardiac silouette on chest x-ray, an echo was obtained.
