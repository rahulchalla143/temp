She reportedly got up to get dinner out of the oven when she experienced a crushing chest pain with a twinging sensation in her neck.
She was sent to the ED at [**Location (un) 1110**] and was found to be in a wide complex tachycardia with LBBB morphology, originally thought to be SVT- vagal maneuvers were performed which she responded to.
She then received lidocaine bolus 100 mg with infusion at 2 mg/min without further arrhythmia recurrence.
Troponin T was 0.02-0.04 with no STE noted while in NSR.
She was then referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of this presumed ventricular tachycaria and surgical intervention on her aortic valve.
Patient also reportedly had 2 episodes of syncope which were evaluated at [**Hospital 1727**] medical center.
She also states that she was standing for both episodes and had decreased PO during the day.
Moderate to severe AS was found.
She then followed up with her cardiologist who attributed her symptoms to AS.
Another echo done 45 minutes apart showed marginal growth.
280 cc of bloody fluid was removed and a drain was placed .
On arrival to the floor, patient was in moderate distress from pleuritic chest pain.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema   Past Medical History: --mitral valve prolapse --hyperlipidemia --obesity --aortic stenosis as above --s/p bladder fistula repair --s/p uterine curettage for vaginal bleeding 4 years ago --s/p partial colectomy for fistula   Social History: She has 3 children.
She has noted a great deal of stress lately with recent bankruptcy.
No other early coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular disease.
No bicuspid aortic valve.
No sudden cardiac death.
Physical Exam: GENERAL: Obese, in mild distress due to chest pain from pericardial drain HEENT: NCAT.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Anterior auscultation did not reveal any rales or rhonchi ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque.
LV EF > 55%, no segmental wall motion abnormalities.
Severe Aortic stenosis with aortic valve area of 0.9 cm2 by continuity eqn.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Diastolic dysfunction is present with e' =7-8 cm/sec.
No clot seen in LAA but the images were not outstanding.
Brief Hospital Course: CCU Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN 63 F admitted for symptomatic aortic stenosis with plans for [**Hospital 64315**] hospital course complicated with ventricular tachycardia, now sp VT ablation complicated with RV perforation and pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.
# Pericardial effusion: pt is sp RV perforation as complication of VT ablation, now with expanding effusion, that is moderate in size, with tamponade physiology.
Patient had a lot of post-procedural pain which was adequately controlled on Dilaudid, ketorolac, and Tylenol.
She required epinephrine drip for a low cardiac output and Lidocaine drip for history of VT which were titrated off POD1 with no further ectopy.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
She had no further ectopy and her beta-blockers were titrated as needed.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD #4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
