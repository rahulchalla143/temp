Admission Date:  [**2166-11-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-11-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2144-4-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 20506**] Chief Complaint: episode of confusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: LP - [**2166-11-14**]  History of Present Illness: 22 year old right handed woman who was transferred from [**Location (un) 47**], for assessment for an acute change in mental status around 2 pm this afternoon.
She had recently been discharged from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 21601**] after treatment for a viral meningitis, her main symptoms were bitemporal pulsatile headaches with photophobia.
Her initial LP on [**10-29**] when she was admitted over there showed 400 white cells with a 95% lymphocytic predominance, 0 red cells, 45 glucose, and 106 total protein.
Her mother mentioned that she had urinary retention, and had left lower quadrant abdominal pain.
No h/o HSV known.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: initial exam:  T-98.4 BP-130/89 HR-86 RR-16 O2Sat-99% Gen: Lying in bed, complaining of not being able to pass urine, when the Foley was inserted she voided>300 ml of urine HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa Neck: No tenderness to palpation, normal ROM, supple, no carotid or vertebral bruit Back: No point tenderness or erythema CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally aBd: +BS soft, suprapubic fullness Skin: no rashes ext: no edema  Neurologic examination: Mental status: Confused, inattentive.
No observed myoclonus or tremor Can hold each limb up for 1 minute without fatiguing, but she cannot comply with formal strength testing.
Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination and Gait could not be assessed  follow up exam (next day): Neuro: MS: alert and oriented x3, intact naming, repetition, knowledge, fluency, comprehension, follows crossed body commands, able to say world backwards, no apraxia, [**4-8**] IR and [**4-8**] SR CN: PERRLA, EOMI, intact light touch and facial strength bilaterally, intact t/u/p, [**6-10**] SCM, VFFTC, no extinction to DSS stimuli Motor: normal tone and bulk of all four ext.
Redemonstration of the restricted diffusion in the genu of the corpus callosum, the significance of this finding is uncertain, given the lack of corresponding abnormality on the color maps of fractional anisotropy.
Faint foci of increased FLAIR hyperintensity in the posterior parts of the thalami on both sides, again of uncertain significance.
Very subtle possible enhancement in the optic nerves, without obvious increased signal on the STIR sequence.
Hence, the significance of these subtle findings is uncertain, ?
Restricted diffusion is seen within the genu of corpus callosum which can be seen in ischemia or demyelination.
Subtle signal abnormalities in medulla, pons and thalami need further confirmation with repeat sagittal FLAIR and T2 and axial FLAIR (without gadolinium).
FLAIR signal abnormalities along sulci and along the surface of the brain are consistent with meningeal inflammation.
Subtle signal changes are seen on diffusion images within both optic nerves and subtle enhancement is suspected on post- gadolinium images.
There were no focal abnormalities or epileptiform features.
EEG ([**2166-11-15**]): Abnormal EEG due to bursts of focal slowing from the left temporal and central regions with secondary generalization indicative of some degree of focal irritation involving primarily the left hemisphere and primarily the left temporal and central structures independently and, at times, synchronously with secondary spread.
A focal infectious etiology cannot be absolutely excluded and this pattern can be seen in the early stages of a typical viral encephalitis or encephalopathy.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted with an episode of confusion after a diagnosis of viral meningitis that was made at a hospital in [**Location (un) 7349**] ([**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 21601**]).
The LP still showed a lymphocytic pleocytosis but it was improving from the last hospitalization.
Imaging showed some mild FLAIR hyperintensity in the thalamus b/l, that was thought to be consistent with the patients recent viral meningo/encephalitis.
It was thought that this breif episode of confusion could have been a result of a seizure brought about by the patient's underlying illness.
An EEG was obtained that was abnormal showing: focal slowing from the left temporal and central regions with secondary generalization indicative of some degree of focal irritation involving primarily the left hemisphere and primarily the left temporal and central structures independently and the patient was started on Keppra.
The patient had persistent headaches throughout the admission but these improved with Toradol, and appeared to improve as the hospital course went on.
The patient was also had some brief hypertension and tachycardia, that were likely secondary to pain, and resolved with pain treatment, and were at baseline on d/c.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Possible seizure after viral meningitis.
Discharge Condition: Good: MS: intact CN: intact, no deficits, Motor/Sensory: no deficits Reflexes: 2+ throughout Gait: normal   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with an episode of confusion after you were given a diagnosis of viral meningitis at an outside hospital in [**Location (un) **].
You had an EEG which showed some abnormailites, and based on your recent infection and episode of confusion you were started on an anti-epileptic medication Keppra.
Please take all medicine as prescribed Please ensure you keep all follow up appointments If you have any worsening of your symptoms, such as new confusion, please call your doctor or return to the nearst ER.
