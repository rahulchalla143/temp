HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old woman with multiple medical problems with a recent admission complicated by PEA arrest x2, Intensive Care Unit admission, respiratory arrest, who presented on [**3-25**] after being intubated at [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital.
The patient reported increasing shortness of breath starting on [**3-23**].
Initially, she had received an increasing Lasix dose and was later found to have pneumonia with a sputum culture which was showing both gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods at the outside hospital.
Therefore, she was intubated secondary to respiratory failure and was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**].
Coarse rhonchi bilaterally.
Heart rate irregularly, irregular, S1, S2, with no murmurs appreciated.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 96 beats per minute with T-wave inversions in II, III, and F which were new compared to prior study from [**2170-3-10**].
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the Intensive Care Unit and treated for respiratory failure secondary to presumed aspiration pneumonia that required intubation.
Her course thereafter was most notable for persistent and progressive anasarca and pulmonary edema, which failed to respond to aggressive treatment with diuretics and titration of her cardiac medications.
Her course was then complicated by persistent worsening of renal failure.
However, when she continued to show no signs of improvement, appear to be in significant pain, and had a slim chance for meaningful recovery in a way that would be consistent with her previously expressed wishes for her care, a series of family meetings were held.
Finally, on [**2170-4-19**], the patient's family was in agreement that the patient would not want to undergo prolonged suffering given the slim chances for meaningful recovery.
Respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella.
