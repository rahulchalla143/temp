She was transferred at [**Hospital3 1810**] for management of necrotizing enterocolitis on day of life 34, and returned to [**Hospital1 346**] on day of life 98 ([**2124-10-9**]) at 3 months postmenstrual age.
A history of her hospital course from [**7-3**] to [**2124-10-9**] is as follows: [**Known lastname 6885**] was born at [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2124-7-3**] to a 23-year-old gravida 6, para 2 now 3 mother whose pregnancy was complicated by severe preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction prompting delivery by cesarean section.
The infant was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 188**] until [**2124-8-6**] when she was transferred to [**Hospital3 1810**] Medical Center with necrotizing enterocolitis for exploratory laparotomy.
Her initial course at [**Hospital3 **] was notable for the following:  Respiratory: Mild respiratory distress syndrome.
She was reintubated on [**2124-8-3**] secondary to increasing abdominal distention.
On day of life 31, she developed bilious emesis and abdominal distention with fixed dilated intestinal loops concerning for necrotizing enterocolitis.
She started treatment for necrotizing enterocolitis on [**2124-8-3**] with vancomycin, gentamicin, and clindamycin.
Heme: Persistent anemia and thrombocytopenia with the onset of necrotizing enterocolitis, required multiple pack red blood cell transfusions and platelet transfusions.
Gastroenterology: Due to persistent abdominal distention, fixed loops on the x-ray, and thrombocytopenia, she was taken for exploratory laparotomy on [**2124-8-7**].
In the operating room, necrosis and isolated perforations of the distal ileum were seen and these were resected with a total resection of approximately 12 cm of ileum, and an end ileostomy and a distal mucus fistula were brought to the surface.
Her initial postoperative course was marked by moderate respiratory and hemodynamic instability requiring brief high- frequency oscillatory ventilation and intermittent dopamine, ongoing hematologic instability requiring pack red blood cells, platelets.
She had persistent abdominal distention and lack of return of bowel function.
Exam and ultrasound were suggestive of abdominal wall cellulitis and wound infection, and she was brought back to the OR on [**2124-8-15**].
Exploration revealed a significant wound and fascial abscess which was irrigated and drained, and the wound was left open and packed.
Subsequently, she showed slow steady progress, eventually extubating and weaning to room air starting on enteral feeds.
She reached full volume feeds in mid [**Month (only) 359**], but had to be briefly reduced due to increased ileostomy output.
Again, she gradually advanced to full volume feeds and then advanced to 28 calories per ounce, but increased stool output again occurred.
She required intravenous replacement of stoma output from [**9-27**] to [**10-3**] due to decreased urine output.
She increased to 30 calories per ounce and up to 160 mL per kilogram per day of fluid due to poor weight gain.
Stools at times were positive for free fatty acids, but negative for reducing substances.
Other issues included an elevated alkaline phosphatase in late [**Month (only) **] to 1,100 to a 1,200 and then gradually declined to approximately 800.
A parathyroid hormone level was normal.
She has had persistent moderate hyperbilirubinemia with direct bilirubins to 4.4 which was the highest.
Infectious disease: She was treated with approximately 2 weeks of vancomycin, gentamicin, and clindamycin after initial diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis with an additional 7 days of meropenem after drainage of the abscess, an additional 7 days of vancomycin for Staph.
Hematology: She received pack red blood cell and platelet transfusions with her last platelet transfusion on [**2124-8-18**].
Follow-up head ultrasound on [**9-5**] was normal, and a repeat head ultrasound on [**9-13**] showed a resolving grade I interventricular hemorrhage.
She had mild ROP noted on an exam on [**9-6**] and then again on [**2124-9-13**] which showed stage 1, zone II ROP bilaterally.
In general, active and vigorous infant in no distress.
Skin: Warm, dry, well perfused, no rashes.
Neck: Supple, no lesions.
Liver 1 cm below right costal margin, no masses, active bowel sounds.
Mucus fistula pink.
GU: Normal female, no hernias.
Extremities: Warm, no lesions.
Neuro: Mildly increased tone throughout.
No apnea or     prematurity.
Her feedings were restricted secondary to her ostomy output.
Due to her poor weight gain, she was increased to 30 calories per ounce, and her volume was gradually increased to 190 mL per kilogram per day.
But when tried up to 200 mL per kilogram per day, she had increased ostomy output.
She has continued to grow very slowly, but does gain small amounts of weight daily.
Direct hyperbilirubinemia presumed secondary to prolonged parenteral nutrition and cholestasis has been followed with the most recent bilirubin on [**2124-10-16**], a total 7.1, direct 4.4.
Neurology: A head ultrasound on [**10-24**] showed a new left choroid plexus cystic region that could represent an evolving hemorrhage versus a multiseptated choroid plexus cyst.
Interval decrease in the mild dilation of a lateral and 3rd ventricles; however, the 4th ventricle remains relatively prominent compared to the other ventricles.
No retinopathy of prematurity.
CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  A 44-3/7 weeks postmenstrual age infant with slow growth on hypercaloric formula.
Born between 32 and 35 weeks with 2 of     the following: Daycare during the RSV season, a smoker in     the household, neuromuscular disease, airway     abnormalities, or school-age siblings; or 3.
Before this age and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
Prematurity at 26-3/7 weeks gestational age.
Metabolic bone disease.
Anemia of prematurity.
Choroid plexus cyst.
Mildly dilated lateral and 3rd ventricles with prominent     4th ventricle, stable 8.
NEC, ileostomy with malabsorption syndrome treated with immodium 9.
Poor weight gain                            [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], [**MD Number(1) 56662**]  Dictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] MEDQUIST36 D:  [**2124-11-6**] 01:52:01 T:  [**2124-11-6**] 04:52:22 Job#:  [**Job Number 63332**]
