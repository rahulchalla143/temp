HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old man who presents with the above chief complaint and his past medical history includes numerous medical problems including non Q wave MI times two, status post CABG in [**2139**], hypertension, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, history of TIAs, history of lower GI bleed and diverticulosis.
The patient was in his usual state of health until approximately 4-5 weeks ago when his degenerative joint disease and disc disease of his lumbar spine began causing shooting right lower extremity pains.
The patient's primary care doctor believed it was due to the high blood sugars and started the Humalog 3-5 days ago.
Yesterday the patient reports the onset of nausea and vomiting after eating.
Also today he reports the onset of loose stools times three.
He denied any fevers, abdominal pain, weight change or urinary symptoms.
He does acknowledge night sweats and chills at night over the last two days.
He has a chronic cough secondary to post nasal drip which is unproductive of sputum.
There is no erythema over the skin where he injects his insulin.
He also denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations or diaphoresis.
He has no PND.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
3) Chronic renal insufficiency.
4) Status post non Q wave MI times two.
9) Lower GI bleed status post polyp removal.
11) Allergies and post nasal drip.
In general he is an elderly man lying in bed in no acute distress.
Neck supple, no jugulovenous distension, no lymphadenopathy, no bruits.
Cardiac exam, irregularly irregular, S1 and S2 normal, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Abdomen, mild tenderness to deep palpation of the left lower quadrant.
Extremities, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Chest x-ray showed no signs of pulmonary edema and no infiltrate.
There is a Q in 3 and F, no ST changes, poor R wave progression.
An echocardiogram from [**2160-4-25**] showed mild left atrial dilatation, non obstructive focal septal hypertrophy, depressed LV function 1+ aortic regurg, mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] fraction could not be estimated at that time.
IMPRESSION:  This is a 77-year-old man with multiple ongoing medical problems who presents with generalized complaints of the last week and a [**11-27**] day history of nausea and vomiting and loose stool.
He was found to be in new onset atrial fibrillation in the ER.
Physical exam was remarkable for the atrial fibrillation with guaiac positive stool and mild left lower quadrant tenderness.
Labs revealed an increased white blood cell count with left shift and low albumin.
Although ischemia is unlikely without any changes in EKG, CKs will be followed.
The patient is in new onset atrial fibrillation but Lopressor will be increased to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] for rate control.
Given the patient's trace guaiac positive stool, history of lower GI bleed, the decision was made to start the patient on Heparin as he had multiple risk factors for stroke elevating him into a higher level of category including his past history of TIAs.
Infectious Disease:  He has an elevated white count with a left shift.
Endocrine:  The patient has poor glucose control.
GI:  He is trace guaiac positive with left lower quadrant tenderness and a history of diverticulosis.
However, we will continue to follow his abdominal exam.
Renal:  The patient has a creatinine of 1.4 with an elevated BUN to creatinine ratio.
He is most likely dehydrated given his nausea and vomiting and slightly prerenal and will be hydrated.
Musculoskeletal and Neuro:  He has decreased strength in his right lower leg consistent with his past medical history of DJD and disc disease of his lumbar spine.
His pain will be controlled with non Opioids as much as possible as Opioids have given him bad reactions in the past.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On hospital day #2 the patient had no adverse events overnight.
The patient is maintained on Heparin and the plan will be to transition him to Coumadin, then to discharge the patient and bring him back at 1-2 months for TEE and cardioversion at that time after anticoagulation, as it is unknown how long patient has been in atrial fibrillation.
Also on this admission the plan is to control his blood sugars, hopefully the combined approach will lead to a resolution of his nausea and vomiting and he can go home.
On hospital day #3 the patient complained of some right thigh swelling.
There was a small hematoma.
Also on the third hospital day the patient became tachycardic and hypotensive with blood pressure in the 60's/30's.
The Heparin was discontinued and an NG lavage was performed that showed dark brown fluid in the stomach with occasional clots which were Gastroccult positive.
A stat hematocrit came back at 26 which was down from 44 on admission, although this is partly due to rehydration, this is significantly due to an upper GI bleed.
The patient underwent emergent EGD that showed clotted blood in the lower third of the esophagus and multiple non bleeding diffuse erosions in the lower third of the esophagus.
In the duodenum there were multiple acute crater ulcers in the bulb and in the second part of the duodenum.
Pigmented material coating these ulcers suggested recent bleeding in one of the ulcers.
On hospital day #5 the patient's main complaint was his right thigh swelling leading to right thigh weakness when he stood up.
He denied anymore episodes of lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, bright red blood per rectum, melena or vomiting of blood.
The plan is to treat the patient for one month with proton pump inhibitors, to follow-up the results of the H. pylori, treat that if positive and to allow the ulcers one month to heal.
