Admission Date:  [**2170-6-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2170-7-11**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Erythromycin Base / Sulfamethoxazole / Sulfa(Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / azithromycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 50171**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH notable for atrial fibrillation, sick sinus syndrome s/p pacemaker, annulocalcific mitral valve disease, chronic kidney disease with recent creatinine of 1.78 ([**2170-6-6**]) who is transferred from OSH for management of fluid status and possible aspiration pneumonia.
She initially presented to OSH on [**2170-6-17**] with hematuria in the setting of supratherapeutic INR (5).
Urology was consulted who recommended holding her coumadin briefly (later bridged with IV heparin) with IV ceftriaxone X 3 days and her hematuria resolved.
She underwent cystoscopy on [**6-22**] which demonstrated diffuse cystitis without active bleeding.
She was found to have a citrobacter UTI with sensitivity to zosyn and patient completed a course of zosyn X 7 days (finished [**6-26**]).
Cardiology was consulted on [**2170-6-27**] (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Houzen) due to intermittent episodes of dyspnea thought to be multifactorial from acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure superimposed on a aspiration vs. hospital acquired pneumonia/pneumonitis.
A CT scan was suggestive of aspiration pneumonia as well as a 5x6mm nodular filling defect within the trachea at the carina level.
In addition to IV solumedrol and lengthening of zosyn course to 10 days for possible pneumonia, patient had received multiple doses of IV lasix (anywhere from 40-80mg IV boluses) due to vascular congestion.
Of note, she has chronic lower extremity edema at baseline.
Her lisinopril, metformin, and glipizide were on hold in the setting of renal failure.
On the floor, patient reports that she continues to feel short of breath and is complaining of a nonproductive cough with associated fits.
She denies fevers, chills, nausea or vomtiing, She denies pain or problems with swallowing.
She is compliang of some right sided chest pain that is located under her breast which has been hurting since a fall prior to her previous admission.

Denies any history of alcohol, tobacco (but did have significant second hand smoke), or substance abuse.
General- Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT- Sclera anicteric, dry mmm, oropharynx clear Neck- supple, JVP elevated at 13, no LAD Lungs- Diffuse inspiratory crackles wet sounding to [**2-5**] way up.
Musical expiratory wheezing throughout the lungs CV- Irregular rhythm, regular rate, with systolic murmu at the LUSB, and blowing mumur at the Apex radiating to the axilla.
no tenderness to palpation of the right chest caudal to the breast  Abdomen- soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU- no foley Ext- warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, left anteior shin abrasion of 1cm in diameter, no surounding erythema or fluctuance.
2+DP pulses bilaterally no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro- CNs2-12 intact, motor function grossly normal .
There is prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings suggestive of mild fluid overload.
There are no pneumothoraces.
There is a dual-lead left-sided pacemaker with the distal lead tips in the right atrium and right ventricle which have intact leads.
Underlying infection is not excluded.
At this location, there are no displaced rib fractures.
CHEST X-RAY ([**2170-7-2**]): There is a dual-lead left-sided pacemaker with lead tips in the right atrium and right ventricle, unchanged.
There is improved aeration and improvement of the airspace opacities throughout both lung fields.
There remains some coarsening of the bronchovascular markings bilaterally, mostly in the perihilar region and at the lung bases, likely represent some fluid overload.
Bilateral patchy airspace opacities with prominent with interlobular septal thickening may be related to congestive heart failure versus a multifocal pneumonia.
No definite evidence for interstitial lung disease is identified.
Calcification along the pleura suggests prior granulomatous disease.
Emphysematous changes in both lungs.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION: Patient was a [**Age over 90 **] yo F w/ PMH of diastolic heart failure, afib and sick sinus syndrome s/p pacemaker placement and recent hematuria in the setting of an elevated INR who developed a possible aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and decompensated diastolic heart failure.
She underwent lasix diuresis to euvolemia and received antibiotics.
Speech and swallow eval revealed persistent aspiration which was unavoidable with oral intake.
ACUTE CARE ISSUES ADDRESSED THIS STAY: #Aspiration pneumonia- the patient had a suspected aspiration pneumonia at the outside hospital which presented with worsening shortness of breath and cough.
She had a CT scan which showed some opacities which were consistent with an aspiration event.
On further review of her history it was learned that she had undergone a barium swallow during which she had aspirated and it quite likely that the CT scan was showing this barium as the aspiration.
She was afebrile with no leukocytosis during her hospital stay.
#Decompensated chronic diastolic heart failure- the patient had become volume overloaded at the outside hospital and had been agressively diuresed.
She was diuresed gently while at [**Hospital1 18**] given her acute on chronic renal failure.
#Diabetes mellitus- the patient had elevated blood sugars in the setting of her pneumonia.
#Sick-sinus syndrome/Atrial fibrillation- the patient was in Afib during this admission without any episodes of RVR or bradycardia while on monitor.
====================== MICU COURSE: On HD #3, patient developed increased respiratory distress on the floor with RR 40s (although satting in mid 90s on 3L NC).
She was started on Vanco + Levoquin to treat possible new HCAP and IV Solumedrol (presumably due to increased wheezing on exam) and transferred to the MICU for BiPAP and more intensive nursing care.
Vanco was DC'd on [**7-4**] due to low suspicion for MRSA pneumonia.
CT chest was performed which showed BL patchy airspace opacities c/w pulm edema vs. multifocal pneumonia, and granular pleural opacities suggestive of prior granulomatous disease.
She remarked on numerous occasions about how miserable she was and how she did not understand the point of all of the tests or medications she was receiving as she was just going to get sick again.
