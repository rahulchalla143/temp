She was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**12-8**] with substernal chest pain which was relieved with Nitroglycerin.
Her work-up was negative for myocardial infarction; however, she had a positive stress test showing mild inferior and posterior hypokinesis and was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further care.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Peripheral vascular disease with multiple bypass grafts to lower extremities, right renal artery bypass, hypertension, question of seizure disorder, question of tobacco use in the past.
Resting hemodynamics showed severely elevated left-sided filling pressures with LVEDP of 40 mmHg.
There was tachycardia and systemic hypertension that responds to beta-blocker and nitrate therapy.
Left ventriculography showed reduced systolic function with an ejection fraction of 40%.
There was anterolateral apical and inferoapical hypokinesis.
There was no mitral regurgitation.
Coronary arteriography showed a right dominant system with three-vessel disease.
Left anterior descending and circumflex were calcified.
There was a long 80% mid left anterior descending stenosis involving the origin of the second septal branch.
There was a focal 60% stenosis in the distal vessel.
There was a large branching first marginal.
The lower pole had 90% stenosis with a preserved distal vessel.
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was transferred from [**Location (un) **] to [**Hospital1 **] for cardiac catheterization after a positive stress test.
In brief, the patient has three-vessel coronary artery disease with moderate systolic ventricular dysfunction and severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
Her course after the operation was significant for left-sided, especially left leg, perceived weakness which in the beginning prevented the patient from doing physical therapy.
There was a subtle weakness on the left side; however, motor and sensory function was completely intact.
CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT.
