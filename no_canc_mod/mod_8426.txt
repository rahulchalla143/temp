HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old female with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease status post three-vessel coronary artery bypass graft surgery x 2, aortic stenosis status post aortic valve replacement, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension with a prolonged complicated recent hospital course at [**Hospital1 1444**] from [**1-30**] to [**2104-3-26**].
The patient was transferred from an outside hospital on [**2104-1-30**] with new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction for cardiac catheterization.
On cardiac catheterization the patient was noted to have left main and two-vessel disease with elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and severe pulmonary hypertension.
The patient's postoperative course was complicated by hypotension requiring pressors, failure to extubate, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate with failure to cardiovert, and acutely worsening congestive heart failure with a decreased ejection fraction of less than 20% (prior to coronary artery bypass grafting the patient's ejection fraction was 50%).
The patient returned for relook cardiac catheterization with noted acute graft closure and underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery, and saphenous vein graft to the diagonal.
Post cardiac catheterization the patient developed acute renal failure with volume overload requiring CVVH, worsening heart failure requiring intra-aortic balloon pump complicated by rectus sheath hematoma, and ventricular fibrillation arrest requiring amiodarone and lidocaine.
An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was placed on [**3-11**] with dual pacer (the delay in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement was secondary to multiple infections throughout the hospitalization including yeast graft harvest site, wound infection, Enterobacter bacteremia, C. difficile colitis, and yeast cystitis).
Two days post ICD placement, the patient developed greater than 70 episodes of ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia.
A repeat echocardiogram demonstrated a thrombus on the aortic valve anterior leaflet.
However, the patient subsequently developed an ICD pocket hematoma requiring operating room evacuation on [**3-17**].
Since discharge the patient has remained hemodynamically stable without further episodes of ventricular fibrillation and the patient has been undergoing a progressive weaning trial from the ventilator with signs of success.
The patient has also remained afebrile, however two days prior to the current admission, the patient was noted to have significant erythema around the ICD pocket site.
Twenty-four hours later the patient was noted to have blood and pus draining spontaneously from the site and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for ICD removal.
The patient denied fever, chills, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, chest pain as well as diarrhea.
Of note, the patient has been off diuretics since [**4-7**] for prerenal azotemia.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (on amiodarone).
Peripheral vascular disease.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Coronary artery disease with three-vessel disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2092**] and redo coronary artery bypass grafting on [**2104-2-5**].
Congestive heart failure with biventricular failure.
Echocardiogram in [**2104-2-16**] had an ejection fraction of less than 20%, severely depressed left ventricular systolic function, severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, 2+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, and bileaflet aortic valve without aortic regurgitation and normal gradient.
History of ventricular fibrillation arrest between [**2-18**] and [**3-13**] status post ICD placement with dual pacer [**3-11**].
Prosthetic aortic valve thrombosis status post TPA thrombolysis complicated by ICD hematoma requiring operating room evacuation.
Failure to wean from the respiratory ventilator status post coronary artery bypass graft, status post tracheostomy on [**3-2**], vent dependent.
Status post right rectus sheath hematoma evacuation.
Aortic stenosis status post aortic valve replacement (St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]) in [**2092**] on Coumadin.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
General:  The patient is a nontoxic appearing elderly female in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements intact bilaterally, dry mucous membranes, no thrush, edentulous.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 with a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border radiating to the neck.
Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no rhonchi, and well-healed midline sternal incision.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema, warm and well perfused, with 1+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally, left lower extremity thigh wound at the graft incision packed with occlusive dressing and no purulent drainage.
Chest x-ray on admission showed no evidence of pneumothorax, ICD leads in good position, bilateral lower lobe atelectasis with small bilateral pleural effusions.
EKG on admission was normal sinus rhythm at 90 with left bundle branch block, left axis, Q waves in leads 2, 3 and aVF with poor R wave progression (unchanged compared with [**2104-2-16**]).
Microbiology of note during the hospitalization with swab cultures from the ICD pocket from admission on [**4-12**] with 3+ Gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters, culture positive for Staphylococcus aureus (sensitivities pending).
Because the patient's admission INR was 2.7, only the ICD box was removed; the pacer/defibrillator leads were capped and left in place for future removal.
An intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of less than 20% with 2% mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation and no evidence of valvular vegetation.
Infectious disease:  The patient's initial OR swab of the ICD site demonstrated 3+ Gram positive cocci in pairs and chains and Staphylococcus aureus on culture.
The patient has remained afebrile throughout the hospital course and blood cultures remain no growth to date.
Cardiovascular:  The patient was monitored on telemetry post ICD removal with frequent premature ventricular contractions and no evidence of recurrent ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
The patient was restarted on low-dose aspirin, statin (with lipids:  total cholesterol 221, LDL 147, HDL 45, and triglycerides 113), and low-dose enalapril for known coronary artery disease (A low-dose beta blocker was not started during the hospitalization secondary to congestive heart failure exacerbation.
However, it is the team's recommendation to start a low-dose beta blocker for known coronary artery disease with better control of the patient's volume status).
Echocardiogram during the procedure and repeat echocardiogram several hours later was without evidence of pericardial effusion.
However, the patient's aortic valve gradient was noted to be somewhat elevated at 52.
Given the patient's reversal of anticoagulation, there was concern for recurrent aortic valve thrombus.
Of note, no thrombus was noted on echocardiogram.
The patient's echocardiogram demonstrated persistent biventricular failure with an ejection fraction of less than 20%, 2+ MR, and 2+ TR.
On hospital day three (off diuretics for a total of five days), the patient developed pulmonary edema as seen on chest x-ray with coincidental decreased oxygen saturations.
The patient's diuretics (Lasix, Zaroxolyn and Aldactone) were restarted with a slow but steady response.
Endocrine:  On admission, the patient developed refractory hypoglycemia presumably secondary to recent dose of glipizide in the setting of decreased PEG tube intake with nausea and vomiting.
The patient continues on Synthroid for hypothyroidism secondary to amiodarone.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient was intolerant of tube feeds early in the hospital course secondary to persistent nausea and vomiting, despite Reglan and Zofran.
On hospital day number three the patient's tube feeds were restarted at 10 cc an hour and advanced slowly without further nausea and vomiting.
The etiology of the drop was unclear with the exception of possible blood loss during the ICD lead removal on [**4-14**].
Of note, the patient also had recent history of guaiac positive stools.
During the hospitalization the patient remained guaiac negative.
