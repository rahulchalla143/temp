His initial presentation was in [**12-31**] when he developed dark urine and DOE.
He did well until [**2154-9-27**] he presented with epistaxis and had a plt of 1000 and was treated with prednisone and IVIG.
He was in his USOH until Friday when he started to have epistaxis when he was at work at [**Company 2676**] and he went to see the nurse's office.
The bleeding would not stop and he sought further care in the ED at [**Hospital6 5016**].
Past Medical History: DM HTN  Social History: Works at [**Company 2676**].
No scleral icterus.
Neck:  Supple, no JVP elevation.
Abdomen:  obese, soft, NT, ND, NABS, no HSM.
Extremities:  warm and well perfused, no edema.
petechia diffusely across legs Neurological: alert and oriented X 3 Skin:  Petechia most prominently on LE Psychiatric:  Appropriate.

Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas as due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 57 yo M with a history of ITP and autoimmune hemolytic anemia who presented to OSH with epistaxis and plt of [**2148**], transferred here for further management.
# Thrombocytopenia/epistaxis/mucosal bleeding/petechiae: Felt to be due to ITP +/-degree of splenic sequestration given h/o enlarged spleen on prior CT scan.
Bone marrow biopsy a year ago c/w reactive process.
No evidence of DIC or TTP on review of peripheral smear by heme/onc.
Pt had some recurrent epistaxis now resolved earlier this morning, and some dried blood on his oral mucosa.
No GI bleeding.
-heme/onc following, appreciate input; pending recs tomorrow will likely need repeat CT scan abdomen to eval degree of splenomegaly -give prednisone 120 mg today (1 mg/kg); per heme onc we may consider decadron -give dose of 120 mg IVIG ; Benadryl/Tylenol prior to and during IVIG infusions -recheck plt after IVIG; will discuss with heme whether to start decadron if plt count does not bump -Patient underwent a splenectomy on [**12-14**] and remained in the ICU monitoring his platelet count.
No evidence of DIC.
Hemolytic labs are negative, so no evidence of hemolysis currently.
Per heme/onc, IVIG and rhogam could potentially worsen his hemolytic anemia and cause hemolysis.
# Diabetes Mellitus Type II, uncontrolled, without complications: Hyperglycemic here, but pt was not on his home regimen (was on NPH 70 U [**Hospital1 **] at home, but at OSH was on less dosing).
