He checked her oxygen saturation and found her to be 92-93% on 2L NC, but over the next few hours continued to be somnolent and with progressively worsening hypoxia to the low 80s on 2L NC and still less than 90% on 4L NC, so she was brought in to the ED.
Her husband also reports that she has had increased cough today, with green liquid/watery secretions, and feeling cold, but notes that she was warm to touch.
She denies any chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or wheeze.
Right IJ CVL was placed due to difficulty gaining access, and blood Cx were sent.

Of note, the pt was admitted for pneumonia from [**2148-6-11**] - [**2148-6-15**] with RLL consolidations, treated with Vancomycin and Cefepime, with a brief admission to the MICU for hypotension and fever that improved without intubation or pressors, transferred to the floor and ultimately discharged on a 7-day course of antibiotics.
She was again admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2148-7-19**] - [**2148-7-21**] with fever and hypoxia, which was thought to be related to a possible exacerbation of viral bronchitis with atelectasis.
She was discharged with acappella for chest PT to aid in lung expansion and decrease oxygen dependence.

had one episode of severe hypotension to 60mmHg SBP accompanied by altered mental status several days after being transferred to the general medical floor.
This occurred after delivering 20 mg of Lasix the day prior for severe shortness of breath secondary to pulmonary edema.
Right lower lung exam and CXR findings concerning for pneumonia.
Fever, leukocytosis with neutrophilic predominance, and increased sputum production supportive as well of a pneumonia.
Per recent chest CT, the patient also had some atelectasis and mucoid impaction which likely contributed to her presenting hypoxia.
On [**2148-7-28**], after persistent hypotension despite treatment, ciprofloxacin was briefly initiated to provide double coverage for pseudomonas.
The patient was given 10mg IV lasix on [**7-30**] and [**2148-7-31**] to diurese the patient after CXR demonstrated evidence of fluid overload.
She had an episode of severe respiratory distress several days after transferring to the general medical floors.
The following day, the pt's blood pressure dropped and she experienced aother episode of hypoxia (as outlined above).
Altered mental status:  Patient initially presented with altered mental status thought to be likely toxic-metabolic given infection, hypoxia and hypotension.
An ABG taken on [**7-27**]/201 showed CO2 of 56 suggesting carbon dioxide retention and mental status changes secondary to hypercarbia.
However, review of records demonstrated chronic hypercarbia with pCO2s in 50s-60s.
had several issues with waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status thought to be a combination of poor ventilation/over sedation with centrally acting medications.
Addendum: Pt has been waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] with her mental status, and has been fluctuating in her ability to maintian oxygen saturations in the 90-92 range, dipping as far as 80%.
UTI: Patient admitted with a urinalysis concerning for a UTI.
The patient has a history of [**Month/Day/Year 40097**] urinary tract infections.
Meropenem was initially withheld as colonization of her urinary tract was presumed and prior [**Month/Day/Year 40097**] infections were Zosyn sensitive.
COPD: Past medical records demonstrate that the patient may have some component of hypercarbia in setting of COPD, with pCO2s in the 50s-60s.
The patient was continued on her home Klonapin dose for anxiety and Trazadone was added on [**2148-7-31**] as a sleep aid.
T1-T2 paraplegia with chronic pain: Patient maintained on multiple medications at home including baclofen, lidocaine patch, methadone, oxybutynin, pregabalin, trazodone, oxycodone.
