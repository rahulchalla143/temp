Reports 10 lb weight gain and sensation of abdominal distension since then.
Had transient substernal chest pain since this morning, started while at rest, worse with moving.
Had some chills at home but when took temperature, did not have a fever.
EKG showed concern for lateral ST depressions.
CXR shows pulmonary edema.
BNP notably elevated at 7436, JVP elevated, she was given lasix 20 mg IV x1, and lasix 40 mg IV x1.
Her chest pain improved following 2mg of IV morphine.
Notably, was admitted here for CHF flare in 11/[**2195**].
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, SOB, orthopnea, weight gain.
Denies palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: DMII HTN HL CHF Chronic Kidney Disease CAD / LCX angioplasty without stent [**2178**] Diabetic gastroparesis  Social History: No tobacco, alcohol, illicits.
EXT: wwp, no edema.
Imaging: CXR [**3-27**] FINDINGS: Compared to prior exam, there is increased pulmonary edema, which is now moderate-to-severe.
There is likely a left pleural effusion; retrocardiac opacity may be related to adjacent atelectasis but is incompletely evaluated on this single view.
No pneumothorax is detected.
IMPRESSION: Increased moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema  TTE [**3-29**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior and lateral akinesis to hypokinesis.
Estimated LVEF ?35-40 percent but views are subotpimal for assement of ventricular wall motion.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
Cardiomegaly and moderate bilateral pleural effusions are essentially unchanged.
There is no definite focal consolidation; however, underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
There is no pneumothorax.
No acute abdominal pathology, especially no evidence of colitis or bowel obstruction is seen.
Extensive vascular calcifications of the abdominal aorta and major visceral branches.
Bilateral moderate-sized simple pleural effusion, with compressive atelectasis of the lung bases.
Small subcutaneous bleed in the the left lower abdomen, likely related to subcutaneous injection.

Also required transfer to MICU for short period for insulin gtt during hyperglycemia and evolving acidosis .
Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF - Patient was diuresed in the CCU on a lasix gtt while requring pressor support for hypotension.
# Hypotension - She was thought be hypotensive due to heart failure on admission.
She initially had a fever and leukocytosis, however work-up was unrevealing and empiric antibiotics were stopped shortly after admission.
# Demand Ischemia - Troponin elevated at 0.91 on admission.
EKG with some subtle ST changes in lateral leads.
This was felt most likely related to demand ischemia in the setting of heart failure and hypotension.
# Acute on chronic renal failure - Baseline creat 1.1-1.5, but presented with creat 2.4.
Initially this improved with diuresis, however worsened in the setting of severe N/V and hyperglycemia.
Most likely etiology was poor forward flow in setting of heart failure and hypotension given improvement with diuresis.
# Hyperglycemia Last A1c dated [**2196-3-1**] was 8.6.
Her PO intake was inconsistent during her stay due to significant nausea and vomiting.
Her insulin doses were decreased due to multiple episodes of hypoglycemia to the 40s.
# N/V:  Most likely related to severe gastroparesis.
A KUB did not reveal obstruction, and an NG tube did not improve her symptoms.
# HTN: Lisinopril held in setting of hypotension and [**Last Name (un) **].
# HL: In setting of statin allergy, ezetimibe was continued.
