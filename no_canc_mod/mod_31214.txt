Labs:  Na 141, K 3.8, Cl 99, Bicarb 39, BUN 13, Cr 0.5, glucose 99, Ca 8.7, Mg 1.7, Phos 1.8, wbc 4.2, hct 39, plt 165 ABG: 7.38/74/56   Pertinent Results: Imaging: [**2158-11-15**] CXR - No definite evidence of pneumonia.
Leftward deviation of the trachea raises suspicion of possible thyroid goiter, although this finding is unchanged since the examination of [**2153-9-28**].
No pulmonary embolus.
Enlargement of the main pulmonary arteries, consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Emphysematous change.
Bilateral adrenal adenomas.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
The  aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet  excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally  normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No evidence of obstruction.
No evidence of mass lesion  [**2158-11-21**] Chest fluoro: No evidence for diaphragmatic dysfunction.
Cardiomegaly, with mild congestive heart failure with interstitial edema and small right pleural effusion.
Right superior mediastinal mass, likely due to goiter.
Please see recent CTA of [**2158-11-17**], which suggested ultrasound for further assessment.
She reports that her symptoms began with feeling lightheaded mostly when she was walking or getting up, then later she felt that she "couldn't get enough air", even when she was sitting down.
Also c/o DOE and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
In ED given Solu-Medrol and pt was started on azithromycin which was switched to levo for empiric coverage of a potential CAP.
No interstitial edema or infiltrate was seen on CXR on [**11-16**].
TTE on [**11-17**] revealed R sided RV dilatation and mod pulm HTN.
LENI failed to show DVT and CTA failed to reveal PE.
ABG revealed significant resp acidosis.
It was felt pt had acute on chronic primary resp acidosis given high serum bicarbs in past.
She had one episode of desaturation to 78% on the evening of [**11-19**].
ABG showed worsening hypoxia.
The pts hypercapnia was felts to be possibly secondary to muscle weakness or central causes possibly exacerbated by an URI since her NIFs were low (30, 60, and 20).
However, showed non-communication hydrocephalus.
She was seen by the neurology team and felt to have some Parkinson's symptoms.
