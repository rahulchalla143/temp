Excision of an infected graft, oversewing of above-knee popliteal artery and femoral to below-knee popliteal artery with non reverse saphenous vein and angioscopy.
Successful emergent PCI of mid LAD with a MINI VISION 2.5x28mm bare-metal stent (BMS)  3.
History of Present Illness: This 65-year-old gentleman had a femoral above- knee popliteal bypass with a prosthetic graft at another institution in [**2111-12-4**].
The procedure was complicated by an MRSA wound infection.
Subsequently he developed a large fluid collection around the graft which appeared clear on CT scan.
Arteriogram demonstrated that the graft was patent with stenosis at the distal anastomosis and runoff was via the posterior tibial and anterior tibial arteries distally.
He has had leg swelling and discomfort from the large fluid collection although he has not manifested septic symptoms and because of the persistent nature of severe leg pain and difficulty walking, he was advised to have the graft removed and replaced with vein graft.

Some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists, though it is accentuated by the lordotic view.
HEAD CT:  FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or infarct.
The ventricles and sulci are slightly prominent, consistent with age-related atrophy.
Air-fluid levels in the bilateral sphenoid sinuses have decreased.
No bony fractures are identified.
Diffuse anasarca and subgaleal fluid collections have resolved.
IMPRESSION: No fractures or intracranial hemorrhage.
CARDIAC ECHO:  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with probable septal and anterior hypokinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus.
Mild symmetric LVH.
There may be other wall motion abnormalities.
Large left pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo M with history of DM2, HTN, HPL, PVD presented on [**2112-7-5**] for excision of an infected prosthetic R femoral popliteal bypass graft.
Briefly - He had a femoral above knee popliteal bypass with a prosthetic graft at another institution in [**2111-12-4**] which was  complicated by an MRSA wound infection and a large > 10 cm fluid collection around the graft in the above-knee popliteal space.
Arteriogram demonstrated that the graft was patent with stenosis at the distal anastomosis and runoff was via the posterior tibial and anterior tibial arteries distally.
He had leg swelling and discomfort from the large fluid collection and difficulty walking.
Was admitted on [**2112-7-5**]  with infected prosthetic R femoral popliteal bypass graft.
He agreed to have an elective surgery.
On [**2112-7-5**] Excision of an infected graft, oversewing of above-knee popliteal artery and femoral to below-knee popliteal artery with non reverse saphenous vein and angioscopy.
Post op Patient suffered hypoxic respiratory failure on extubation post procedure.
He suffered a PEA arrest, and code blue was called.
TEE was performed at the time of the code which demonstrated severe anterior wall hypokinesis.
Cath revealed 80% LAD stenosis, and a BMS was placed in the proximal LAD with restoration of flow.
In the CVICU, he spiked fevers as high as 101.7 and was covered for infection broadly with vanc/zosyn/cipro.
He was maintained on heprin drip for wall motion abnormality.
When he was stabalized from the acute setting of post operative care.
Speech and swallow Consult - he was noted with mild to moderate oral and pharyngeal dysphagia with premature spillover, likely swallow delay and reduced pharyngeal constriction resulting in pharyngeal residue.
Neurology Consult was obtained, for his exam is notable for weakness in the left lower extremity and a skew deviation of the right eye and ptosis suggesting a midrain lesion at the level of the third nucleus.
Although it is unclear of the etiology of this stroke, the patient had a prolonged period of hypotension preceded by cardiopulmonary arrest which may have been the cause.
Commercial wound cleanser or normal saline to irrigate/cleanse all open wounds, Pat the tissue dry, Apply duoderm hydrogel, Cover with small Mepilex, Change dressing every 3 days  On the floor, he remained hemodynamically stable with his pain controlled.
He continues to make steady progress without any incidents.
