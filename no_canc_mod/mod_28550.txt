He stated that he fell back, hit his head, blacked out for a brief period, awoke and called 911.
He denies having had any chest pain prior to falling, no syncope or seizure like activity.
He has had black-outs in the past from his heavy alcohol abuse.
The patient denied drinking in excess of his usual dose of 1L whiskey per day, but called 911 after falling due to inability to get up.
He was admitted to the outside hospital for further evaluation after his fall with symptoms of nausea, back pain.
He was found to have acute renal failure, marked tense ascites, and history of poor PO intake.
Renal followed the pt and thought he had hepatorenal syndrome.
Plan was to do an Abdominal U/S to evaluate ascites and do a therapeutic paracentesis, which was not done prior to transfer.
Past Medical History: -Alcohol Abuse -Alcoholic Cirrhosis, complicated by ascites, s/p paracentesis 8L [**7-12**] -Hepatic encephalopathy -Pancytopenia -s/p multiple falls and black-outs in the past -Hyponatremia  Social History: - Lives alone, 2 daughters-twins age 16 live in [**State 108**] with kid's mother.
ASCITIC FLUID STUDIES: [**2153-9-27**]: WBC-52* RBC-8* Polys-21* Lymphs-39* Monos-16* Mesothe-24* TotPro-1.2 Glucose-122 LD(LDH)-59 Amylase-16 Albumin-<1.0 [**9-27**] culture: no growth .
[**2153-10-2**]: WBC-130* RBC-970* Polys-60* Lymphs-20* Monos-15* Mesothe-4* Macroph-1* TotPro-1.1 Glucose-115 LD(LDH)-51 Albumin-<1.0 [**10-2**] culture: no growth .
IMAGING [**2153-9-26**] CXR: Opacification at the medial aspect of the right lung base could be consolidation or atelectasis in either the middle or lower lobe, and may also represent small right pleural effusion, largely subpulmonic.
No pneumothorax or upper mediastinal widening.
Lateral displacement of the left paraspinal line just above the diaphragm could be due to distended esophagus or esophageal varices.
There is at least a mild degree of intestinal distention seen in the upper abdomen, but no subdiaphragmatic free air.
[**2153-10-1**] EGD: Granularity and mosaic appearance in the whole stomach compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy Erythema and erosion in the antrum compatible with gastritis (biopsy) Atrophy in the duodenum (biopsy) Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum .
[**2153-10-1**] GASTROINTESTINAL MUCOSAL BIOPSIES: A.  Antrum:  No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
B.  Duodenum:  No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
Started on lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy ppx.
He was also put on CIWA and received diazepam, and pt never showed frank signs of withdrawal.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 42 yo M with extensive ETOH abuse, ETOH Cirrhosis, hyponatremia, malnourished presents s/p fall in setting of ETOH intoxication found to have ARF.
Underwent 6L paracentesis in ICU, had .
# ETOH cirrhosis: When he initially presented, he had tense ascites secondary to his EtOH cirrhosis.
Studies of the ascitic fluid were not consistent with SBP but was still started on cipro for SBP prophylaxis.
He was strated on lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy prophylaxis.
He also had an elevated INR.
EGD was performed and was consistent with portal hypertensive gastropathy, showing gastritis in the antrum and atrophy in the duodenum.
No abnormalities were found on biopsy of antrum and duodenum.
# ETOH abuse: He has an extensive history ETOH abuse and blackouts secondary to drinking.
He appeared very malnourished with significant ascites as above.
They felt he did not appear acutely depressed, that his overall flattened affect and cognitive slowing appeared more related to longer term effects of EtOH.
# ARF: On admission he was in acute renal failure, with creatinine 2.3.
His renal failure resolved with IVF.
# Abdominal wall cellulitis: During his hospitalization, the patient developed cellulitis on his left abdomen extending around to the back and the left groin.
The etiology was felt to be multifactorial-- partly a chronic problem from ETOH cirrhosis and diuretic use and also hypovolemic secondary to worsening ascites and decreased PO intake.
He was poorly compliant with fluid restriction, however his Na had normalized to 135 by the day of discharge.
# Anemia: Unclear baseline but most likely from ETOH abuse and marrow suppression.
No history of GI bleed per patient or records.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO X1 (ONE TIME) as needed for insomnia.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: 1)Acute renal failure 2)Alcoholic cirrhosis .
Secondary: 1) Alcohol abuse 2) Abdominal wall cellulitis 3) Anemia of chronic disease 4) Hypovolemic hyponatremia  Discharge Condition: Stable, ascites stable, satting well on room air.
