IMAGING: CT Head: FINDINGS: No acute hemorrhage, mass lesion, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or evidence of major territorial infarct is apparent.
No acute fracture or extracranial soft tissue abnormality is present.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
There is hyperinflation consistent with obstructive airways disease.
Post-surgical changes noted in the right sixth posterior rib.
No focal consolidation is present.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with COPD without acute process identified .
Abdominal U/S: FINDINGS: The study is limited due to a background noise; however, no liver focal masses are detected.
There is no ascites.
The gallbladder is unremarkable, and there are no stones.
IMPRESSION: Technically limited study with no evidence of focal liver mass or ascites.
Brief Hospital Course: MICU Course: Patient was admitted for presumed new onset diabetes and possible DKA.
Patient did have mild anion-gap acidosis initially, though this was confounded by acute renal failure, aggressive normal saline.
Normal saline with KCl was given for fluid resuscitation.
His anion gap resolved, as did his acute renal failure.
Abdominal ultrasound was performed for possible history of liver disease.
The ultrasound did not demonstrate any ascites or other obvious intraabdominal pathology.

# COPD: Stable, no evidence of exacerbation.
# Acute renal failure: Felt prerenal, secondary to hyperosmolar diabetic diuresis.
# HTN: The patient was hypotensive in the ICU initially, felt secondary to severe volume depletion.
