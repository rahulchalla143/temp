Ms. [**Known lastname 88934**] reports gradual onset of shortness of breath with associated pleuritic substernal chest pain and non productive cough that started 3 weeks ago.
She reports subjective fevers which she started measuring last week and reports temperatures ranging from 98 -102.
She reports no change or progression in her symptoms over the past three weeks despite notes detailing phone calls from her niece reporting increasing severity.
She reports a 1 day history of left lower extremity swelling.
She has occasional occasional nausea, vomiting and some episode of diarrhea week prior.
She has decreased apetite, but denies abdominal pain, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia, hematemesis, skin rashes, joint pains, oral ulcers, urinary symptoms, numbness or tingling, muscle tenderness or weakness.
A 10 day course of levofloxacin was prescribed and a CT scan was performed which demonstrated diffuse ground glass opacities, new since prior imaging in addition to progression of her pulmonary artery hypertension.
As her symptoms continued to progress she was seen in clinic today.
With regards to her oncologic history, she first presented to her PCP with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] right breast lump in [**Month (only) **] of this year with ultimate work-up and demonstrating multicentric invasive ductal carcinoma, histiologic grade 3 with extensive necrosis and priminent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates.
Her post-operative course was complicated by admission in [**Month (only) 216**] for a chest wall abscess associated with a surgical wound, with MSSA bacteremia and toxic shock syndrome.
She presented to oncology clinic on [**11-5**] for week 2 of taxol which was held in the setting of her cough and dyspnea.
A CTA chest was limited secondary to suboptimal bolus timing and poor field of view selection.
No PE was visualized and worsening diffuse ground glass opacities.
She was lying in bed, mildly tachypneic and able to answer questions in full sentences.

Findings again may be due to an atypical infectious process including a viral infection, or possibly a drug reaction.
Limited exam with excludion of the upper lobe pulmonary arteries on the CTA component; therefore pulmonary embolism within the upper lobes cannot be excluded.
No pulmonary embolism otherwise seen.
Worsening bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities which appear more confluent.
Differential considerations include drug reaction or an atypical/viral infection.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Interval improvement in aeration but a persistent bilateral interstitial airspace process is again seen, which could represent an atypical pneumonia or drug toxicity.
There is slight prominence of the main pulmonary artery in this patient with known pulmonary hypertension.
No pneumothorax.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.

Brief Hospital Course: 51 year old with triple negative Stage II breast cancer s/p right mastectomy currently on adjuvant chemotherapy with ACT presents with persistent cough, hypoxia and low grade fevers with evidence of bilateral ground glass opacities on CT scan concerning of pneumonia.
patient had been seen and evaluated by PCP and oncologist in the weeks prior to admission reciving cough suppressants and course of levofloxacin.
Patient's symptoms progressed despite these interventions and was evaluated in the ED.
CTA was negative for PE, but showed diffuse ground glass opacities.
Patietn was able to ambulate around the unit without difficult or SOB prior to discharge.Although patient was clearly improving,the exact etiology of pneumonitis unclear.
# Hyperglycemia:  patient was noted to have elevated FSG to the 250s after initiation of prednisone.
# Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension on Imaging: CXR on serial exams demonstrate increasing size of the pulmonary arteries similarly suggested on CT scans concerning for pulmonary hypertension.
Patient had repeat ECHO which again did not demonstrate elevated pulmonary artery pressures.
# Stage II breast cancer: Currently day 11 of taxol therapy.
Day 8 treatment deferred in setting of respiratory symptoms.
