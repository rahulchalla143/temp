Admission Date:  [**2141-12-31**]     Discharge Date:  [**2142-1-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2118-11-17**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 25800**] is a 23-year-old male with a past medical history significant for admission to [**Hospital1 69**] from [**2141-12-18**] to [**2141-12-23**] for bilateral pulmonary emboli status post TPA administration.
During this admission, he was also found to have a patent foramen ovale on echocardiography.
Patient received a hypercoagulable state work up during this admission which was notable for an anticardiolipin antibodies and a heterozygosity for a prothrombin gene mutation.
After discharge from first hospital admission, the patient continued to improve until one day prior to admission when he noted cough productive of mild amounts, he estimated a half a cup of bright red blood with some accompanying dark clots.
Patient denies any feeling of lightheadedness, dizziness or weakness.
Patient denies any fever, chills, cough or shortness of breath.
Has occasional cough.
Significant for right upper extremity basilar vein superficial thrombophlebitis.
Chronic lower extremity swelling which was diagnosed as chronic compartment syndrome.
ALLERGIES:  Patient denies any known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of hypercoagulable or bleeding states.
Anicteric sclerae.
No oropharyngeal lesions were appreciated.
Patient's nares were only significant for a small spot of old blood on the right nares.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Extremities:  No clubbing or cyanosis.
Patient received a chest x-ray which was normal without focal consolidation or pleural effusion.
ENT consult was obtained and found no evidence on fiberoptic examination of any recent bleeding in patient's nose.
Consult was able to induce bloody sputum on prompting without any evidence of nasal bleeding thus suggesting pulmonary source.
Shortly after admission, the patient experienced recurrently hemoptysis, approximately 500 cc.
CT Scan of the patient's chest was obtained to evaluate for possible recurrent pulmonary emboli.
CT Scan showed interval stable 2 mm nodule left lung apex, notable for interval appearance of patchy areas of ground-glass opacifications in the right lower lobe and additional patches of ground-glass opacification in the right middle lobe.
No pleural effusions.
These abnormalities were concerning for pulmonary hemorrhage in addition to pneumonia, filling defects within the bronchi of the right middle and right lower lobe were also appreciated.
The patient continued to have episodes of hemoptysis.
The scan showed significant recanalization of the left pulmonary arterial system with extensive retraction revascularization of previously noted pulmonary emboli.
The residual filling defects within the segmental branches of the left lower and left middle lobe vessels were appreciated.
No lymphadenopathy, no effusion.
Scan again concerning for pneumonic consolidation versus area of infarct secondary to difficulty of reversal Lovenox at which time patient was started on heparin.
On [**2142-1-4**], patient underwent flexible and rigid bronchoscopy which showed a large blood clot obstruction right lower lobe bronchus which after suctioning revealed a small polypoid lesion at the take off the right lower lobe bronchus with a stream of pulsatile blood emanating from it.
Intervention Pulmonary Team used argon plasma coagulation to coagulate the lesion which was successful without further bleeding.
The patient also received bronchial arteriogram which showed take off at the right bronchial artery at the level of T4, T5 which showed a bronchial artery to lower right pulmonary artery shunt.
Concern was raised given patient's history of the right lower lobe pulmonary embolus, embolization of this right bronchial artery to right pulmonary artery fistula could possible result in infarction of the patient's right lower lobe.
Discussion with Medical Team, Thoracic Surgery Team and family was then held discussing options of:  1) Coil embolization with possible consequence of right lower lobe infarction, 2) a right lower lobe lobectomy or 3) a conservative approach of gentle anticoagulation with the hopes of continuing and low dose thrombolysis would promote natural closure of fistula.
In the setting of elevated right sided pressures in the setting of patient's pulmonary emboli, embolization and lobectomy were felt to possibly impose significant risk to patient at this time.
Serial hematocrits showed no drop in patient's hematocrit status post argon beam therapy.
The patient was clearly instructed to lay on right side in the event of any bleeding and to present to the Emergency Department immediately.
