NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
[**2141-10-20**]: PORTABLE AP CHEST: No prior studies are available for comparison.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is bibasilar atelectasis and bilateral pleural effusions.
No focal consolidations are seen.
Right apical pneumothorax, which appears new in the interval.
Bandlike areas of lucency in lower paraspinal region which appear to represent a combination of posterior pneumomediastinum and adjacent pulmonary interstitial emphysema on recent chest CT. 4.
Perihilar and basilar opacities, with overall improving aeration at the lung bases.
Tiny right apical pneumothorax following chest tube removal.
Bibasilar opacities with interval worsening at the left lung base.
The area of worsening could be due to a progressive infection or due to superimposed aspiration.
Multifocal bronchopneumonia with patchy consolidation and bronchial wall thickening.
Pneumomediastinum and pulmonary interstitial emphysema.
1) Respiratory failure:  His presentation was consistent with poorly controlled asthma exacerbated by smoking although it is unclear what was the precipitating factor for status asthmaticus.
With his elevated WBC, bandemia and spiking fevers, CXR, sputum cx, blood cx, ucx were obtained for fever workup.
Blood culture showed strep viridans, but this was likey contaminated.
CT scan showed bullous lung disease, patchy opacities, and collapse of lower lobes bilaterally.
Bronchoscopy showed small amounts of thick mucus.
BAL performed grew out pan-sensitive klebsiella and oxacillin-sensitive staph.
Alpha1-antitrypsin and HIV serologies were sent to workup etiology of the small bullous lesion seen on CT scan, however both were negative and it is felt that the lesions were due to barotrauma, as evident by pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, and bilateral pneumothoraces.
He had no further respiratory difficulties, with O2 sat of 96% on RA on the day of discharge.
2)  The patient had hyperglycemia due to steroid use while in the ICU that was covered with RISS.
3)  The patient had an elevated CK on admission to the ICU that slowly trended down.
