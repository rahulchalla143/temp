CXR [**2131-4-17**]: The patient is markedly lordotic.
No focal consolidation is identified.
No pleural effusion is detected.
The azygous vein is prominent but however, there is no evidence of failure.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
No stone, mass, or hydronephrosis demonstrated bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Echo [**2131-4-18**] Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic gradient is likely related to high cardiac output.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 54 yo female with history of depression, hip fracture with surgical repair and recent UTI admitted for hypotension.
Her hospital course during this admission is as follows:  1 Hypotension- Initially admitted to MICU ([**Date range (1) 19627**]), ddx initially included sepsis (although afebrile, no leuko, only dirty UA, clear CXR, normal lactate) vs cardiogenic (not likely, given nl EF on echo) vs hypovolemia (most likely as pt hasn't been drinking much).
[**Last Name (un) **] stim negative (3.6->16.7->21.5)Echo showed dilated left atrium, normal EF >55%, no new wall motion abnormalities.
Renal US negative for obstruction or hydronephrosis.
FeNa >1%, however, suggests likely component of ATN as well.
3 Anemia- baseline hct 22-31, currently stable.
No signs of active bleeding.
Pt reports history of iron deficiency.
Iron studies with both iron deficiency and elevated ferritin and she was started on Fe supplementation.
4 Metabolic acidosis- non- anion gap, likely secondary to saline resuscitation.
ABG shows slight respiratory alkalosis with hypercapnea as well.
5 ID- patient recently treated for UTI, now with UA suggestive of infection; cover with ciprofloxacin, f/u blood and urine cultures which were ngtd.
6 Cardiac- no known cardiac history, no symptoms suggestive of ACS.
Elevated CK and troponin in the setting of ARF.
Risk factors include family history and history of hypertension.
Enzymes trended down, echo without any evidence of ischemic event.
7 Depression- currently stable, denied any SI/HI; initially psych meds held in setting of renal failure, but restarted her home meds(prozac, BusPIRone, Venlafaxine) once hypotension and ARF resolved.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: care network  Discharge Diagnosis: primary diagnosis: hypotension (resolved, likely due to dehydration and UTI) Acute renal failure (resolved, most likely due to dehydration)  secondary diagnosis: Hypertension Depression MVA s/p right hip arthroplasty   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for hypotension, most likely due to dehydration or urinary tract infection.
Cal 911 or go to the nearest emergency room if fever>101, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, severe nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dizziness, or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
