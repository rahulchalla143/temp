Slight intraventricular conduction delay with left axis deviation may be due to left anterior fascicular block.
Since the previous tracing of the same date no significant change.
[**2120-3-26**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Silhouette of the left heart border, could reflect a lingular atelectasis or consolidation.
[**2120-3-26**] LENI: IMPRESSION: No DVT in bilateral lower extremities.
Nodular hepatic architecture with no focal liver lesion identified.
[**2120-4-16**] TTE: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricularsystolic function.
Small lung volumes, bilateral areas of atelectasis, but no evidence of focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 62-year-old male with history of DM on insulin, [**Month/Day/Year 2091**], R ORIF with Ex-Fix in place who presents from rehab with altered mental status and low sugar.
# Right lower extremity infection: The patient has a chronic right lower extremity cellulitis and osteomyelitis secondary to a traumatic R tibiotalar posterior dislocation and open trimalleolar fracture s/p external fixation [**2120-3-7**].
He is s/p multiple debridements and revisions with non healing R ankle wound.
# Altered mental status: The patient has multiple etiologies of his altered mental status.
He presented with renal failure, decompensated cirrhosis, LE infection.
His renal failure eventually required hemodialysis.
His hepatic encephalopathy was treated with lactulose and rifaximin.
# ESRD: The patient had renal failure that was most consistent with hepatorenal syndrome.
He is now considered to have ESRD dependent on HD and is currently anuric.
Midodrine is continued for hypotension but octreotide is no longer needed.
He had a variceal bleed requiring EGD and banding.
He has ascites and was continued on paracentesis with albumin replacement afterwards.
Patient passed speech and swallow, and was given regular POs on the day of discharge.
# GIB: Pt developed melena on HD 2 with associated HCT drop.
The EGD showed esophageal and gastric varices, with blood clot in the stomach without obvious active bleeding.
# Thrombocytopenia.
HIT unlikely given timing, degree of platelet drop and other factors that are more likely.
# CP/SOB: Pt had complained of CP/SOB on arrival to the Emergency Department.
There were no EKG changes but his troponin was 0.12 in the setting of chronic renal insufficiency.
A PE protocol CT was not performed due to concern over his renal function.
His CEs were flat and there were no EKG changes.
He has had no complaints of CP or SOB since his initial presentation to the ED.
# Respiratory failure: The patient aspirated and developed hypoxemic respiratory failure.
He was able to be weaned and extubated without difficulty.
# Diabetes mellitus: Patient was on glargine and humalog sliding scale, and his blood sugar was well-controlled during this hospital stay.
# Hypotension:  Patient's blood pressure was low (sbp in the 80s and 90s) during this hospital stay.
# Obstructive sleep apnea: Patient was on BiPAP overnight during this hospital stay.
# Rheumatoid arthritis: Not on home medications.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: - cirrhosis - hepatic encephalopathy - hepatorenal syndrome - ESRD on HD - right ankle fracture dislocation s/p 6 OR procedures since [**Month (only) **] [**2120**], 5 of the 6 procedures during this admission - GIB - Hypotension .
Secondary diagnoses: - DM - Anemia - OSA - RA - Depression   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes, alert and oriented to place and person, thinks the year is '[**2122**]' Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Bedbound   Discharge Instructions: It was a pleasure to be involved in your care, Mr. [**Known lastname **].
You were initially admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] because of altered mental status, and you had a prolonged hospital course complicated by GI bleed, respiratory failure, hepatorenal syndrome resulting in end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, and waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status due to liver cirrhosis and ankle infections.
You were taken to OR 5 times during this hospital stay for irrigation, debridement, repair, and antibiotic bead placement and removal in your right ankle fracture wound.
Followup Instructions: Please have hemodialysis sessions as instructed.
