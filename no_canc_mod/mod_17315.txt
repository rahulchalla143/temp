Brief Hospital Course: 87 year-old M with CHF and HTN who presents with post-operative hypotension, now stable, with serosanguinous discharge from abdominal surgical incision site.
* Post-Operative Wound Hemorage: Pt with new onset bleeding from surgical site.
Concerning for new hematoma after he worked with PT vs worsening ascites either from hepatic or cardiac etiology exsanguination of seroma.
CT abd without contrast at OSH showed marked anasarca, minimal ascites.
Abdominal ultrasound with ascites in right side of abdomen, seroma around surigical site in LLQ, without hematoma.

Echo revealed biventricular cavity enlargement with severe systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
* Systolic CHF with pleural effusions and ascites: Mild hypoxia.
Biventricular cavity enlargement with severe systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
Moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
At least moderate mitral regurgitaiton.
Most likely from CHF with hepatic congestion.
No evidence of active bleeding, Hct stable.
