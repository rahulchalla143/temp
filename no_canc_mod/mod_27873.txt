No surgical history.
The patient was afebrile and vital signs were stable upon presentation to the ED with a regular rate and rhythm.
A trauma series was performed which was notable for severe multilobar pulmonary contusions and/or aspiration combinations.
He was also noted to have a right scapular fracture with no gross fracture of the pelvis.
A CT C-spine was then performed which showed no evidence of fracture dislocation of the cervical spine.
A CT head was performed which showed a subtle high density along the right sulci of the right frontal lobe which is worrisome for a subarachnoid hemorrhage given the setting of extensive trauma.
He was also noted to have air fluid levels within the bilateral maxillary sinuses and mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was also performed which was notable for an extensive grade IV liver laceration with hemorrhagic fluid in the abdomen and pelvis with high density material possibly representing clot.
There was also noted to be a small splenic laceration with surrounding hemorrhage.
There was an area of high density with fluid in the region of the right adrenal gland.
There was hemorrhagic fluid in the deep pelvis.
The patient was also noted to have extensive subcutaneous emphysema with pneumomediastinum, moderate left pneumothorax and a small right pneumothorax.
The patient tolerated these procedures well without any complications.
He was also noted to have a right ankle fracture which was discovered on an x-ray on [**2194-11-21**].
The patient also received neurosurgery consults for his subarachnoid hemorrhages.
The patient also subsequently went to the operating room on [**2194-11-29**], with orthopedics for ORIF of his ankle fractures.
An echo was performed on the patient on [**2194-11-22**], which showed normal cavity sizes with low normal left ventricular systolic function with mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
A repeat CT of the head was obtained on [**2194-11-24**], which showed that the bolt was removed with an unchanged appearance of the brain with tiny foci of high density in the right frontal lobe.
He is also being discharged on Percocet for pain control.
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was instructed that he had a MCV versus tree.
He was told also to call the orthopedic or neurosurgery clinics for the following: Temperature greater than 101.1, any nausea or vomiting he may experience, any seepage along the incisional sites, any alterations in mental status, any increased pain that he may experience.
