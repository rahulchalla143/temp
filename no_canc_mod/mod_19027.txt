Admission Date:  [**2161-3-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-3-4**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Percocet / Dilaudid (PF)  Attending:[**Attending Info 11308**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status, unresponsiveness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right ventricular lead revision   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old white female with a recent PPM for CHB, history of CAD, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and arthritis who presented to [**Hospital6 33**] with altered mental status and failure of RV capture.
Per ED report, the patient had a syncopal episode at her nursing facility today.
The patient just had a pacemaker placed on [**2161-2-17**] at [**Hospital3 **] after prolonged episodes of complete heart block with asystole and no escape rhythm.
The patient's family subsequently reports that the patient had been complaining of some discomfort in the left lower chest/ left upper abdomen over the past 2 days.
There are no reports of any recent chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, new back pain, or trauma.
The patient was not able to answer review of systems questions or identify exacerbating or alleviating factors.
The patient did have some eccymosis about the left side of her head.
The patient was bradycardic and a CXR demonstrated a displaced right ventricular pacer wire.
At [**Hospital1 18**], we noted complete loss of capture of the pacemaker RV lead, and intermittent or absent capture of the temporary pacing wire.
During periods of her complete paroxysmal heart block, she was completely pacer dependent.
On Echo, there was concern for RV lead displacement but no evidence of tamponade or effusion.
A repeat ECHO demonstrated no effusion or complication of lead placement.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS:  Dyslipidemia, Hypertension, diabetes mellitus 2.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of duodenal ulcer.
History of ventral hernia.
History of abdominal wall abscess.
History of colocutaneous fistula.
Hyperlipidemia 15.
Bilateral hip replacements.
Antrectomy and vagotomy with [**Doctor First Name 892**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] II reconstruction with splenectomy and partial pancreatectomy for duodenal ulcer.
Exploration of abdominal abscess.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Pt intubated CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi on anterior lung exam.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
No xanthalesma.
1/6 systolic flow murmur .
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Pt intubated CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi on anterior lung exam.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
New right ventricular lead projects medial to the ventricular apex, however it's exact position cannot be completely assessed without a lateral view.
Small layering pleural effusion persists on the left and there is mild bilateral basilar atelectasis.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion with no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
There is no pericardial effusion.
URINE CULTURE (Preliminary):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old white female with a history of CAD, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, DM, and arthritis with recent PPM placement at [**Hospital1 **] on [**2-18**] for complete heart block (?paroxysmal av block) and syncope who presented to [**Hospital6 33**] with altered mental status and a displaced RV pacerlead with bradycardia now s/p pacer lead revision.
# COMPLETE HEART BLOCK/RV LEAD DISPLACEMENT: The patient had a DDD pacemaker placed at [**Hospital1 **] on approximately [**2161-2-22**] for symptomatic (syncope) bradycardia.
A temporary pacing wire was placed [**2161-3-2**] at [**Hospital3 **] without complication and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
An echo here demonstrated no pericardial effusion, but showed clear perforation of the RV lead.
She underwent RV lead revision, with post-operative echo showing no complication.
Repeat Echo demonstrates only minimal pericardial fluid, but no evidence of tamponade.
She received a one time dose of vancomycin, and then on discharge, will continue keflex, renally dosed, for a total of 7 day of Abx coverage for lead revision.
# CHF: diastolic dysfunction.
DDx included prerenal vs intrinsic.
# COPD - known history of COPD.
# E. Coli UTI - UA suggestive of urinary tract infection.
She denied urinary symptoms while here.
# Diarrhea: resolved.
# Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with HCP .
# Transitions: - E.coli sensitivities from urine culture pending - spoke with PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].

9. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
Right ventricular lead revision   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were admitted for malfunction and displacement of your pacer lead.
You had an echocardiogram which showed no complication.
You were noted to have a urinary tract infection.
