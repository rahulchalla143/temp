PULMONARY:  The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint without shortness of breath or other symptoms.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was treated with Coumadin in variable doses for a goal INR of 2 to 3 for his low ejection fraction.
ONCOLOGY/ENDOCRINE:  Given the lytic and blastic lesion seen in the patient's bony tissue after his fall in the Intensive Care Unit, an Oncology consultation was requested to evaluate the possibility of metastatic disease.
The Oncology opinion was that the patient did not have metastatic disease given his normal calcium, normal alkaline phosphatase, and mildly elevated prostate-specific antigen.
At that time, an Endocrine consultation was requested to evaluate for the possibility of a metabolic process.
At the time of this dictation, the following laboratory studies requested by the Endocrine Service were available:  dihydroxy vitamin D was normal, 25 hydroxy vitamin D was normal, urinary NT peptide elevated at 260 (upper limit of normal 85).
Bone scan showed nonspecific heterogenous uptake in the spine.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine showed degenerative changes of the spine without metastatic disease or cord compression.
These degenerative changes were stable when compared to an outside magnetic resonance imaging in [**2138**].
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  The patient was continued with a hard cervical collar for his dens fracture.
The patient has outpatient followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Orthopaedics for his neck fracture including further imaging studies to assess healing.
At the time of discharge, the bone biopsy which had been considered as a means to assess the nature of the patient's bone disease had been deferred as it was likely that the bone disease is degenerative.
Consider the following medication changes:  Discontinuing iron sulfate as it is not clear that the patient has iron deficiency anemia and consider discontinuation of diltiazem if blood pressure and pulse are well controlled.
