Per her family, her niece visited her on [**7-22**] and found the patient feeling unwell and short of breath.
CXR revealed bilateral airspace opacities, bilateral infiltrates v. pulmonary edema, which were noted to be rapidly increasing overal serial CXRs.
Further workup revealed increasing cardiac enzymes, CK of 153->1143, CKMB of 11->150, Troponin T of 0.06->2.03 (0.01-0.04).
Preliminary ECHO work-up showed EF of 30-35%, severe inferior wall hypokinesis, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] report, EKG showed SR at rate of 100, with Q waves in lead III and AVF and non-specific ST-T wave changes.
In the cardiac cath lab, she was found to have 100% stenosis of distal RCA, which was stented with 2 BMS.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left ventricular filling pressures with RVEDP of 27 mmHg and PCW of 25 mmHg.
Per family, ROS was positive intermittent substernal chest pain for the past 2 years.
Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had presented with pedal edema and weight gain 3 months ago.
She also has a chronic productive cough.
She had been hospitalized for pneumonia twice in the last year and may have required intubation.
Past Medical History: Asthma Obesity, s/p gastric bypass in [**2187**] Depression s/p cesarean sections x2   Social History: Patient is divorced with 2 sons.
Family is unaware of any withdrawal issues.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Normoactive bowel sounds, soft, NT/ND, no HSM.
No abdominial bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2193-7-23**] demonstrated: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral akinesis.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2193-7-23**] demonstrated: The LMCA, LAD, LCX showed no obstructive coronary artery disease.
The RCA showed a distal discrete 100% stenosis with left to right collaterals.
There is marked cardiac enlargement configuration indicating a prominence of the left ventricular contour as well as a beginning double contour and widening of the tracheal bifurcation indicative of left atrial enlargement.
There is no pneumothorax.
There are bilateral mostly centrally located parenchymal densities consistent with pulmonary edema.
Possibility of some bilateral pleural effusions layering in the posterior pleural spaces in this patient in supine position can, however, not be excluded.
CONCLUSION: Findings remain suspicious for multiple infarcts, shown to be subacute in age.
There is no evidence of an immune complex glomerulonephritis.
The focal vascular changes noted are insufficient for a definite diagnosis of a thrombotic microangiopathy.
Skin biopsy: Multiple thrombi within small vessels in dermis with overlying ischemic epidermal changes consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy.
No vasculitis is seen.

DIAGNOSIS:  MILDLY HYPOCELLULAR ERYTHROID DOMINANT BONE MARROW WITH DYSERYTHROPOIESIS AND DYSMEGAKARYOPOIESIS.
A primary myelodysplastic syndrome appears less likely, but can not be entirely ruled out.
CD138 highlights plasma cells in interstitial and perivascular distribution, which by Kappa/Lambda light chain immunostaining appear polytypic.
Erythrocytes show significant anisopoikilocytosis with polychromatophils, macrocytes, target cells, echinocytes, dacrocytes, microcytes, ovalocytes and basophilic stippling.
Numerous nucleated RBC's are seen, some with irregular nuclear contours and asymmetric nuclear budding.
Neutrophils with toxic vacuolization are prominent and include hypogranular forms.
Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:  The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and consists of two pieces of fragmented core biopsy with partial aspiration artifact measuring 0.6 cm in aggregate.
Interstitial debris and macrophages appear prominent.
Erythroid precursors are relatively increased in number and show occasional dysplastic forms (asymmetric nuclear budding and irregular nuclear contours).
There is an interstitial infiltrate of plasma cells / lymphoplasmacytic cells occurring singly and in small clusters occupying 10% of marrow cellularity.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname 62766**] is a 44 year old female admitted initially to an OSH for multifocal pneumonia, found to have an NSTEMI, s/p BMS to RCA on admission.
Hospital course further complicated by multiorgan system failure.
Found to have mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral akinesis on echo.
She had cardiac cath and was found to have 100% stenosis of distal RCA, which was stented x2 with BMS.
The patient remained hypotensive after cardiac catheterization, and was found to have mitral regurgitation.
Her mitral regurgitation worsened thoughout her hospital course and she developed cardiogenic shock dependent on dobutamine.
Patient was initially admitted to [**Hospital1 **] after presenting with a multifocal pneumonia.
Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], patient had daily fevers in spite of broad spectrum antibiotics and negative cultures.
Her CXR improved, however, she had persistent altered mental status and tachypnea thought be secondary to a central process preventing extubation.
She was given steroids for a short period.
However, given her persistent respiratory alkalosis and cheynes-[**Doctor Last Name 6056**] breathing, she underwent tracheostomy.
Due to her distorted anatomy secondary to gastric bypass, a PEG was not performed at the same time.
During her hospital course, she had episodes of small amounts of hemoptysis.
Altered mental status.
Following cardiac catheterization, patient found to have several embolic strokes.
Patient had serial TTEs and a TEE looking for a source, but was not found.
She remained minimally responsive and with cheynes-[**Doctor Last Name 6056**] breathing.
EEG x 2 showed toxic-metabolic patterns.
Renal Failure.
Patient developed renal failure during her hospital course.
Etiology of her renal failure was not clear.
A renal biopsy could not rule out thrombotic microangiopathy, but was felt to be consistent with ATN.
There was concern for TTP given thrombocytopenia that developed three weeks into her hospital stay, but the decision was made against empiric plasmapharesis after consultation with transfusion medicine.
Patient was given 2 units of cryoprecipitate for increasing DIC picture, and also started on heparin gtt without bolus for concern of TTP and increasing ischemia in lower extremities.
The patient progressed with hemodialysis for several weeks.
During the week of [**9-18**] she became intolerant to fluid shifts during hemodialysis and would become hypotensive either during or shortly after hemodialysis.
She was reaching the point where she was requiring fluid boluses after every hemodialysis session.
Patient developed thrombocytopenia, elevated fibrin split products, low fibrinogen, thought to be consistent with DIC.
She had a biopsy of her skin consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy.
She had decreased perfusion to her feet as well.
Her thrombocytopenia and coagulation abnormalities resolved, however, the patient suffered ischemia of her distal extremities with resulting necrosis.
In spite of broad spectrum antiobiotics and steroids, she had daily fevers.
She subsequently developed a line infection treated with seven days of vancomycin.
She developed C.Difficile colitis and was treated with flagyl and oral vancomycin.
She developed a CMV viremia and was treated with ganciclovir.
She had an acitenobacter vent associated pneumonia and completed a course of augmentin.
In addition, she developed multiple other fevers which were attributed to line infetions, treated with vancomycin.
This was thought to be due to decreased mobility secondary to her altered mental status.
Pain Control: The patient experienced continuous pain from her necrosed and gangrenous feet and fingers.
The family raised concerns that fentanyl administration was causing increased drowsiness of the patient, and requested that it be curtailed.
The patient's pain was continuously evaluated by the nursing staff and physicians and treated appropriately with fentanyl.
On [**9-1**], TTE findings of 4+ MR, plus low central venous O2 saturations rasied the concern for a cardiogenic componenet.
Her blood pressure, lactate levels, and central venous O2 saturations improved with initiation of dobutamine.
She remained otherwise hemodynamically stable during this period without alterations in her baseline blood pressure or heart rate.
She slowly became hypotensive and was started on vasopressin, in addition to levophed.
The cause of her acte lactic acidois and electrolyte abnormaities were unknown, but it was thought that she may be in worsening cardiogenic shock from a new myocardial infarction, cardiac tamponade, or massive pulmonary embolism, she may have been in septic shock, or she have suffered an insult to another organ system such as acute bowel ischemia.
Stat cardiac echo did not show cardiac tamponade, or new wall motion abnormalities suggestive of pulmonary embolism or myocardial infarction.
She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and meropenem to cover for possible infection causing shock, in addition to coverage for clostridial species with flagyl, PO vancomycin, and clindamycin.
Physical examination revealed a distended abdomen.
Liver enzymes showed elevated transaminases consistent with ishemic liver, normal bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, normal lipase, but an elevated amylase to 853.
The acuity of the patient's deterioration, in addition to rising lactate, elevated amylase, and distended abdomen, led us to believe that the patient was experiencing bowel ischemia.
this would not be surprising in a patient with an underlying coagulopathy of uncertain etiology.
The family was spoken to at 9pm and told of her grave prognosis.
The family was fixated on the patient's fentanyl use, and believed that her depressed mental status was due to fentanyl.
It was explained to her family that her current condition was not secondary to fentanyl administration, and that an acute unidentified event occured which is causing the patient's deterioration.
They were told that this event was most likely mesenteric ischemia but that it was uncertain, because the patient was too ill to be imaged.
She was told that the cause of her impaired cardiac contractility was her underlying acidosis, and that nothing medically could be done to stop the acidosis from worsening.
The patient's hematocrit dring this time decreased from 18.0 to 9.0, possibly from intrabdominal hemorrhage from perforated bowel as a result of bowel ischemia.
