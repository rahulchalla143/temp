Admission Date:  [**2108-6-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-6-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2027-9-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: Palpitations  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ablation procedure for AVnRT   History of Present Illness:     80 yo F with a hx of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (on Amiodarone and low dose BB) and ?
of previous episode of SVT who was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for a fall and found to have loculated pleural effusion resulting in thoracentesis and VATS .
She was also found to have oropharyngeal dysphagia of unclear etiology s/p PEG tube placement and was transferred to [**Hospital **] rehab on levo/flagyl for her PNA.
Since her transfer to [**Hospital1 5595**], she developed superficial cellulitis of her PEG tube site and was started on keflex x3days.
She now returns with multiple loose stools and fever to 100.9.
The patient had a CXR performed at [**Hospital1 5595**] which did not reveal any acute PNA, as well as stools positive for c.diff x1.
At [**Hospital1 5595**], the pt was found to have a tachycardia with HR to 150s-160s and a BP of 90/50 resulting in this ED presentations.
She became more hypotensive with SBP in the 70s to 80s and she was successfully cardioverted in the ED with return to NSR at 70s with some improvement in SBP to 100s.
She was also given Vancomycin 1g and Flagyl 500mg for her PNA and ?c.diff.
This may have been precipitated by her septic possibly from c.diff and recommended admission to CCU for further management.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation 2.
Oral and Pharyngeal dysphagia of unclear etiology - EMG, MRI and neuro eval without clear cause - Failed speech and swallow with video swallow test s/p PEG tube placement on [**2108-6-5**] by GI 3.
Loculated pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis (exudative) and s/p VATS for decortication and drainage and chest tube x2.
Hypertension 6.
Hypothyroidism 7.
Bilateral leg weakness 9.
Occular muscle weakness   Social History: Retired, lives alone, supportive family, no ETOH, no tob, no IVDU .
THYROID: deferred LYMPH NODES: no lymph adenopathy appreciated in the submandibular, cervical, supraclavicular nodes CHEST: CTA bilaterally CV: tachycardic with regular rhythm, no m/r/g ABD: soft, NT, ND, no rebound, guarding, BS+ EXT: wwp, no c/c/e NEURO: A+O x3, conversant, appropriate   Pertinent Results: STUDIES: CXR [**2108-6-25**]: "There is infiltrate in the right middle lobe consistent with pneumonia.
There is likely blunting of the right costophrenic angle consistent with a small pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with right middle lobe pneumonia.
CXR [**2108-6-26**]: "IMPRESSION: Mild cardiac enlargement without evidence of CHF.
Marked regression of right-sided basal postoperative pleural changes.
No new pulmonary infiltrates."
Mild stranding around the right colon which could represent mild colitis.
Small right pleural effusion with associated consolidation and atelectasis within the right lower lobe.
Enhancing pleura could represent post-surgical changes.
Two hyperdense lesions within the right lobe of the liver that cannot be completely characterized on this single phase study.
Possible etiologies include FNH or hemangioma.
[**6-29**] S&S Study: SUMMARY / IMPRESSION: The pt does have intermittent aspiration as known from the video swallow and seen today at the bedside.
Pt should turn her head towards the right and tuck her chin to her chest with liquids and solids.
NO WHOLE PILLS.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 80yo F with recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for loculated pleural effusion s/p VATS/pneumonectomy who was recently treated with keflex for G tube site cellulitis p/w tachycardia in setting of c.diff.
Tachycardia briefly resolved with carotid sinus massage and also adenosine but then quickly returned.
B. Coronaries: The pt does not have any stress test in the records to validate presence/absence of CAD, has no focal motion defects or depressed EF to suggest ischemic disease on recent TTE.
Her troponin was slightly elevated to 0.05 on admission but CK and MB wer negative which rules out acute ischemia.
C. Pump: The pt appears euvolemic --> mildly overloaded on exam.
Received 6-7 L of IVF since admission on [**6-26**], given her septic presentation.
Hypotension: The hypotension may have been secondary to her AVnRT, however since her BP did not improve even after restoration of NSR at 70s, more likely due to her initial infected/septic presentation.
No subsequent pressor requirement.
ID: Given the development of fever and diarrhea along with positive C.diff stool and WBC count of 20.5 on admission, this was most likely due to c.diff especially in the setting of recent antibiotic use.
As the pt had not completed a course of Flagyl, this was not thought to reflect true failure to flagyl.
CXR was without any clear evidence of new infiltrate or effusion.
Patient has small erythematous area around the tube that had been treated last week with Keflex.
Unclear is this swab represents colonization versus true infection.
FEN: Speech and swallow consulted as patient known to be an aspiration risk.
Had Re-S&S on [**6-29**], which suggested ongoing evidence of aspiration, but recommended allowing nectar-thick liquids and pureed solids.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - [**Location (un) 550**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses AVnRT - AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia C diff colitis MRSA colonization   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: Please take all of your medications as prescribed.
* Please call your doctor or return to the emergency department if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, dirahhea, if you cannot eat, drink, or take your medication, or you develop any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
