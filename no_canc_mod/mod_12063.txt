HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 51 year old man who was recently evaluated by his primary care physician for complaints of atypical left upper quadrant abdominal pain.
A CT scan was obtained which detected a large right common iliac aneurysm 4.5 by 4.5, along with a small left common iliac aneurysm.
The patient had a cardiac work-up which revealed an essentially normal echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of 60 to 70% along with no ischemic symptoms by exercise tolerance.
The patient underwent an arteriogram by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**7-28**] which demonstrated a right pseudo-iliac aneurysm and a left common iliac aneurysm.
No previous surgeries.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
A video swallow done on [**2129-6-3**], demonstrated decreased bolus control with premature spillage.
There was poor epiglottic dysflexion throughout the entire study.
Residue remained in the panniculi with nectar liquids and there was trace penetration during swallowing of nectar liquids.
Bilateral venous studies for deep vein thrombosis were obtained on [**2129-9-20**], which showed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity from the inguinal to popliteal region as well as the right common femoral vein.
A CT scan of the chest attained on [**2129-8-31**] for persistent fevers demonstrated heart and pericardium were unremarkable.
There was no significant hilum or spinal, axillary lymphadenopathy.
There are bilateral pleural effusions which are moderate sized.
There is bilateral apical patchy infiltrates seen greater on the right than on the left.
There is a left subclavicular and jugular line in the inferior aspect of the superior vena cava.
There were small gallstones in the dependent portion of the gallbladder, however, there was no wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid collection.
The left kidney showed an inferior simple cyst.
There was free fluid in the abdomen and that has not changed significantly in amount compared to previous study.
There is no free air in the abdomen.
Post-surgical changes were seen in the mesentery on the left side.
The infraradial aorta-[**Hospital1 **]-iliac bypass was seen with a small amount of hematoma around the graft, but no extravasation, but there is a peri-aortic collection which has expanded since the previous study of [**8-31**].
There is no change in the retroperitoneum hematoma on the left.
Chest x-ray, single view only, done on [**2129-9-24**], did demonstrate low lung volumes with subsequent atelectasis in the left lower zones.
No evidence of pulmonary edema.
The patient had open bedside laparotomy on [**8-26**], later that day and returned to the Operating Room for intra-abdominal sepsis and bleeding of the iliac vein.
On [**9-4**], the patient had bilateral chest tubes placed secondary to moderate pleural effusions bilaterally and underwent an exploratory laparotomy which was unremarkable.
On [**9-9**], he underwent abdominal washout with fascial partial closure and then returned to the Operating Room on [**9-12**] for exploratory laparotomy, abdominal washout and repair of a serosal small bowel tear and fascial closing with Silastic.
During his hospitalization, he required total parenteral nutrition and nasogastric tube feeds secondary to aspiration.
He was initially evaluated by Speech Therapy on [**9-22**], and then a repeat video swallow was done on [**10-3**], which continued to show aspiration with thin liquids.
Recommendations were soft solid ground foods and thickened liquids.
His diet will be regular soft solids with thickened liquids.
Bilateral iliac aneurysm status post aorta-bifemoral graft with right iliac vein injury status post repair.
Bilateral pleural effusions, status post chest tubes.
Blood loss anemia, corrected.
