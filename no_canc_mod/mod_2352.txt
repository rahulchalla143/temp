CXR [**3-22**]: Right subclavian vascular catheter has been placed, with the tip terminating within the lower superior vena cava.
No pneumothorax is evident on this semi-upright radiograph.
New area of air space opacity has developed in the right lower lung region, and may be due to an area of asymmetrical edema or acute aspiration superimposed upon underlying edema.
Small right pleural effusion is also noted.
There may be a small left-sided pleural effusion.
Surgical staples project over the epigastrium, left upper quadrant, and left lateral chest wall.
No pneumothorax.
No evidence of dissection or aortic aneurysms is seen.
Moderate fatty stranding around the pancreas.
Compressive atelectatic changes at both lung bases.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, or infarction.
No abnormalities detected.
No evidence of pulmonary edema or sizable effusions.
There are no focal consolidations.
There may be mild plate-like atelectasis at the left lung base.
IMPRESSION: Stable cardiomegaly without evidence of CHF or pneumonia.
Echo [**3-23**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No pneumothorax is identified.
No CHF or gross effusion is identified.
There is minimal blunting at the right costophrenic angle.
There is some increased retrocardiac density, which is likely accentuated by technique and patient body habitus.
No definite focal infiltrate is identified.
If clinical suspicion for a focal infiltrate remains high, then this could be further evaluated with a lateral view.
Vague areas of consolidation at the lung bases concerning for developing infiltrate.
Sputum [**3-22**]:                              STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE                              | CEFTRIAXONE-----------   <=1 S ERYTHROMYCIN----------       R LEVOFLOXACIN----------       S PENICILLIN------------       I TETRACYCLINE----------       R TRIMETHOPRIM/SULFA----       R VANCOMYCIN------------       S   Brief Hospital Course: She was found in the ED to have SaO2 100% on NRB, with severe acidosis (7.01/77/113 on NRB), hypercalemia, and acute renal failure (creat 6.0).
She was pan-cultured, given one dose of levofloxacin, and started on bicarb gtt; she was eventually intubated after a trial of BiPap was not tolerated.
Serum tox was negative, urine tox (not obtainable in ED secondary to anuria) eventually was positive for opiates and cocaine.
She was transferred to the MICU for respiratory failure and ARF.
In the MICU, she was on a ventilator and treated for COPD and broadly covered for pneumonia (levo/flagyl).
TTE showed global hypokinesis.
She had copious purulent sputum suctioned early in the course and had episodes of hypoxia; she was placed on a Lasix drip with good response.
She had fevers, which prompted a change in antibiotic coverage from levofloxacin to aztreonam and ciprofloxacin.
Given persistent fevers, clindamycin was started for question of sinusitis.
