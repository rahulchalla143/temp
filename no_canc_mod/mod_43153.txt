TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT. CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no evidence of masses, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, infarction, or hemorrhage.
Bilateral basal ganglia calcifications are seen.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with age-related atrophy.
Confluent hypodensities within the periventricular white matter likely represent chronic microvascular ischemia.
The osseous structures demonstrate hyperostosis frontalis interna.
Partial opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally is noted.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2152-6-29**] 2:53 PM INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with vomiting and abdominal pain.
CT ABDOMEN: There is mild dependent bibasilar atelectasis.
There is a thin crescent of hyperdensity layering in the gallbladder fundus, which may represent a tiny amount of [**Doctor Last Name 5691**] versus a small focus of adenomyomatosis.
There is no hydronephrosis.
There is a moderate axial hiatal hernia and a small fat-containing ventral hernia.
There is no free air, free fluid, or abnormal intra- abdominal lymphadenopathy.
There is mild atherosclerotic calcified and noncalcified plaque throughout the abdominal vasculature.
There is no definite free pelvic fluid.
There is no abnormal pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

Multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracolumbar spine are noted, with moderate dextroconvex thoracolumbar scoliosis.
No specific CT finding to explain hematemesis and abdominal pain.
Moderate axial hiatal hernia.
Diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
Small fat-containing ventral hernia.
ECHO [**2152-6-30**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
A mild apical intracavitary gradient is identified.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There are low inspiratory volumes.
Allowing for this, there is probable moderate cardiomegaly and mild unfolding of the aorta.

There is a small right pleural effusion posteriorly.
There is also minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles.
No focal infiltrate is identified.
Sinus rhythm with supraventricular premature depolarizations.
Marked lateral ST segment depressions.
Compared to the previous tracing sinus rhythm is now present with overall reduced ventricular rate and diminished ischemic ST segment depression.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 71 142 96 444/463 86 64 169  ECG - [**2152-7-4**] - Ectopic atrial rhythm with ventricular premature depolarizations.
Inferior myocardial infarction.
Short P-R interval with abnormal P wave axis raising consideration of ectopic atrial rhythm.
Diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2152-7-3**] an ectopic atrial rhythm is now present with inferior myocardial infarction pattern.
Shoulder XR [**2152-7-4**] - IMPRESSION: No acute fracture detected involving the proximal humerus or shoulder girdle.
Possible old healed proximal humeral fracture.
Probable chronic rotator cuff tear.
Superior and anterior subluxation of humeral head with respect to glenoid, but no frank dislocation.
Some of this may be due to left lower lobe atelectasis.
No pulmonary edema or vascular redistribution to suggest heart failure.
No appreciable pleural effusion.
This examination is not designed for detection of rib fractures which are easily missed.
Compared to the previous tracing no major change.Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 128 0.86 312/431 0 -9 -155   Brief Hospital Course: HYPERTENSION, HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY, ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Ms. [**Known lastname 96278**] was initially admitted to the MICU after coming from the ED on a labetolol drip for her hypertension.
Once in the MICU, neurology was consulted for altered mental status, non-fluent aphasia and possible left-sided neglect.
Neurology ultimately felt her presentation was consistent with transient worsening of her dementia from relative hypotension/hypoperfusion in the setting of aggressive blood pressure reduction.
She had no residual deficits and was at her baseline dementia.
Head CT showed no evidence of bleed.
She had registration but significantly impaired recall at 5 minutes, with no improvement with prompting or lists.
On [**2152-7-2**], she then dropped her systolic BP to the 70's when her rhythm changed from sinus to atrial fibrillation with RVR.
She was noted to have ST segment depressions in I, II, AVL, V3, V4, V5, V6 and ST elevation in III, AVR, VI.
She did not respond to IV metoprolol, and as pacer pads were being placed she developed ventricular fibrillation.
She became pulseless for which chest compressions were initiated and the patient was given 1 shock.
Repeat EKG showed NSR, but continued, however to show lessened ST changes as above.
GIbIIa inhibitor was not started due to concern for acute bleeding.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Once patient was hemodynamically stable, she was transferred back to the floor on [**7-4**], where she continued to have episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Because of frequent conversions from atrial fibrillatin to sinus rhythm, her age and her history of hypertension and diabetes, patient was deemed a candidate for anticoagulation.
LEUKOCYTOSIS: She was noted to have leukocytosis on admission.
She was afebrile throughout and was never on antibiotics while in-house.
UPPER GI BLEED: The day of admission, Ms. [**Known lastname 96278**] has several episodes of emesis thought to be from GI upset in the setting of the severe hypertension.
The last episode of emesis was coffee-grounds and guaiac positive.
Her bleeding appeared to resolve as her Hct was stable throughout the admission and she had no further episodes of emesis.
She did test positive for H.Pylori by EIA, but was not treated due to no signs of acute bleeding and the risks associated with long term antibiotic treatment in a geriatric patient.
On [**7-4**] patient was noted to have right sided abdominal pain on deep palpation.
Negative [**Doctor Last Name **], no signs of acute abdomen were noted on exam.
has a ventral hernia on CT from [**6-29**], but no other abdominal process to explain the pain.
LEFT SHOULDER PAIN: Left shoulder and chest wall pain were also noted on [**7-4**].
Patient also had supraspinatus tenderness, no apprehension sign.
Given recent chest compressions when she was coded, there was concern for fractures.
X-ray did not show fractures of the ribs or shoulder/humerus.
Shoulder x-ray showed probable rotator cuff tear.
HYPOTHYROIDISM: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and her synthroid had been recently increased from 50 to 225 mcg in the course of 1 month, and while at [**Hospital1 18**], she has been given 50 mg given concern for overmedication causing AFib.
CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE: At baseline, patient has CKD with likely etiology being HTN.
SCLERAL BUCKLE: Opthalmology also consulted for a possible intraocular hemorrhage that was seen on CT on admission.
Patient was started on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Heart failure - patient has documented heart failure of likely diastolic dysfunction.
Her diet is restricted as below and she has no fluid restriction.
Patient should be weighed daily and monitored for symptoms of heart failure: shortness of breath, leg edema, orthopnea.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One Hundred (100) mg PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Myocardial infarction, Hypertensive emergency Secondary: Hypertension, Atrial fibrillation, Diabetes mellitus, Chronic kidney disease   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable  At discharge she was conversant, pleasant and was able to follow multistep commands.
She had registration but significantly impaired recall at 5 minutes, with no improvement with prompting or lists.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with significantly elevated blood pressure.
As you were treated for this, you had changes in your mental state.
You then developed a new arrhythmia, following which you had a heart attack.
These were thought to be due to elevated thyroid hormones.
Finally, because of your arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation) you were started on a medication (coumadin) to help prevent a stroke.
Should you experience new chest pain, shorness of breath, difficulty speaking, dizzyness, palpitations, fever, cough, new pain or any other symptom concerning to you, please contact your health care provider at the rehabilitation facility or go to the nearest emergency room.
