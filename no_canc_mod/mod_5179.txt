PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  He has no past significant medical history or surgical history.
ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.
HEENT:  He had icteric sclerae.
He had no jugular venous distention.
Pulmonary:  Lungs had decreased breath sounds at the bases.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen: Nondistended but tender to palpation diffusely, especially at the midepigastric and right upper quadrant area.
Extremities:  He had no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
No motor or sensory deficits.
Chest x-ray was with poor inspiratory effort with left hemidiaphragm, elevated and large amount of dilated loops of bowel with gas.
He had a right pleural effusion which was moderate to large.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was thought to have acute pancreatitis possibly due to gallstones.
GI:  The patient was thought to acute pancreatitis possibly secondary to gallstones.
He did have some postresidual distention of his abdomen.
He continued to have somewhat elevated amylase and lipase but overall had a general decline.
The CT did not show any evidence of bleeding.
It did show subphrenic collection of fluid.
It also showed bilateral pleural effusion.
Radiology aspirated the subphrenic collection draining approximately 30 ml.
Repeat CT was again performed which showed similar subphrenic fluid collection with bilateral pleural effusions.
A repeat CT was done because of increased pain after the aspiration of his subphrenic collection.
He has not really had any nausea or vomiting for much of his admission.
Pulmonary:  The patient came in with a moderate to large right pleural effusion.
He also had left-sided pleural effusions.
He been intubated during the ERCP and was easily extubated; however, he had increased oxygen requirements.
He had complained of some chest pain but had no electrocardiogram changes.
After the thoracentesis procedure, he had some right-sided chest pain and right flank pain.
He became tachypneic greater than usual at a rate in the 50s.
An ABG was done which showed respiratory alkalosis.
No electrocardiogram changes were noted.
The patient has had right lateral wall chest pain, particularly on movement, respirations, coughing, or sneezing.
He is not in any respiratory distress and has no shortness of breath.
He was also started on Combivent and Albuterol/Atrovent nebulizers which had some moderate affect.
The tachypnea was thought to be due to 1) atelectasis, 2) pleural effusions, 3) splinting from the right upper quadrant abdominal pain after the CT, and he had a subphrenic fluid collection which was thought to have increase his abdominal pain and subsequently his shallow, rapid respirations.
Repeat chest x-ray did show some right lower lobe and possibly right middle lobe atelectasis.
Cardiovascular:  The patient never really had an ischemic event.
He had an echocardiogram done which showed an ejection fraction of 40%, and within the echocardiogram, he had no gross evidence of abdominal cardiac function.
Renal:  The patient had an elevated creatinine after the ERCP which increased to 2.9; however, with hydration, the patient's creatinine had decreased gradually.
He was converted to oral Dilaudid on [**8-21**] because of some right flank pain.
He required Dilaudid 4 mg almost every 6 hours; however, he has decreased pain.
He will also be followed up with his primary care physician either in [**Name9 (PRE) 8**] or with the [**Hospital3 **] at [**Hospital6 256**] where he will be assessed for his pleural effusions and subphrenic fluid collection, pulmonary status, and resolution of the gallstones, and pancreatitis.
