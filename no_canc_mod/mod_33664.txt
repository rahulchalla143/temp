He initially presented in [**3-/2161**] with fatigue and dys[pnea.
He denies any history of chest pain.
Echocardiography in [**Month (only) 547**] showed severe systolic dysfunction with an EF of 20-25%.
He then underwent Adenosine stress perfusion imaging [**2161-6-22**] which showed a medium defect of moderate intensity in the mid-inferolateral, apical - lateral, apical-inferior  walls with mild partial reversibility at rest.
There was a small defect of mild-moderate intensity in the apical anterior, apical-septal and true apical walls with minimal reversibility at rest.
Past Medical History: Chronic Atrial fibrillation s/p stroke x2 LV dysfunction diagnosed [**2161-3-10**] peripheral arterial disease  Systolic Heart failure noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus gout h/o rheumatic fever hypertension glaucoma  Social History: Tobacco history:  None x 20 years.
Sclera mildly icteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Mild L lower facial droop NECK: Supple CARDIAC: RR, normal S1, S2.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
EXTREMITIES: 2+ edema B/L L>R SKIN:  +stasis dermatitis, no ulcers.
PULSES:  Radial pulses 2+ B/l, DP pulses + on doppler B/l   Brief Hospital Course: Cardiac catheterization revealed triple vessel disease.
An intraaortic balloon pump was placed to augment hemodynamics given his severely impaired left ventricle.
He subsequently had a rising lactate and TEE revealed LV hypokinesis with overdistention.
A Lasix infusion was started with good results and the balloon pump was removed due to leg ischemia the next morning.
He was anticoagulated for his chronic atrial fibrillation.
He was noticed to have jaundice and a total bilirubin was elevated.
This study showed no obstructions or gallstones.
Given his low ejection fraction, coreg was increased as tolerated and an ace inhibitor was started.
