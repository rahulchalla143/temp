History of Present Illness: HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: 52 M with hx chronic low back pain s/p surgery [**12-7**] who presented to [**Hospital 47**] hospital ED with worsened back pain in the setting of a recent fall.
He has been on narcotics with some estrangement from his PCP and went to the ED seeking pain relief .
He also noted that he had woken up with mild neck pain and proximal arm numbness accompanied by mild SOB, palpitations and pleuritic chest pressure all of which he associated with anxiety.
On arrival to the [**Location (un) 47**] ED he was noted to be tachycardic with HR in 180s and he was found to be in wide complex tachycardia on EKG which was initially thought to be an SVT and he received several doses of adenosine which he was sensitive to, but didn't break, going into sinus, then bigeminy then back into VT.
Of note, he underwent cardiac catheterization within the past year for exertional chest discomfort and a reportedly abnormal stress test.
Left axis, Left bundle, positive in inferior leads and inferior laterally-briefly responsive to adenosine.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or presyncope.
In the ED, HR 102 on lidocaine gtt, vitals otherwise wnl, chest pain free.On arrival to the floor, [**3-8**] neck/chest pain with negative EKG, severe back pain with dilaudid given and lidocaine gtt continued.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Depression:  major depressive episode with hosptialization in [**8-7**].
Anxiety Chronic Back pain s/p Laminectomy   Social History: SOCIAL HISTORY -Tobacco history: 30ppy hx -ETOH:distant -Illicit drugs:none Lives with friends in [**Name (NI) 47**], former truck driver.
[**2141-3-9**] FINDINGS: The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.
No effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.
Mildly increased left ventricular cavity size with mild global left ventricular systolic dyfunction.
The LVEF was mildly depressed at 49%.
The effective forward LVEF was moderately depressed at 36%.
There is CMR evidence of prior myocardial scarring/fibrosis in the right ventricular insertion sites and lateral wall as detailed above in a non-coronary pattern.
No CMR evidence of right ventricular dysplasia however right ventricular fatty infiltration cannot be excluded.
Moderate mitral regurgitation with rheumatic deformity of both mitral valve leaflets and the subvalvular apparatus.
Mild pulmonic regurgitation.
Mild tricuspid regurgitation.

Pt states he has had symptoms in the past but has not been evaluated.
Cardiac MRI suggests related to old scar tissue.
No evidence of ischemia as trigger.
Pt did not complain of any chest soreness after ablation.
#2 Depression/Anxiety: major depressive episode with hosptialization in [**8-7**].
Bedrest was thought to exacerbate chronic LBP and pt was initially treated to dilaudid IV and transitioned to oxycodone PO q 4hours.
[**First Name (STitle) **], was contact[**Name (NI) **] and related history of narcotic seeking behavior that included multiple trips to ED with narcotic request.
Pt was asking for oxycodone prescription at discharge stating that Pain clinic did not adequately treat his pain.
#4 Leukocytosis: ?
stress response.
No fever, exam non-focal.
Stable at discharge with no evidence of infection.
Cyclobenzaprine  Oral   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Ventricular Tachycardia Chronic Low back pain s/p laminectomy Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You had ventricular tachycardia that was caused by scar on your heart muscle seen on the MRI.
We performed an ablation that should prevent this arrythhmia in the future.
WE increased your metoprolol to also prevent any arrhythmias.
WE treated your chronic low back pain by increasing your neurontin.
You need to make an appt with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at the pain clinic to continue treatment for low back pain.
