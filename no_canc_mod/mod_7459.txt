He underwent echocardiography on [**2113-4-28**], and the impression from that test was no echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved workload.
He also underwent an exercise tolerance test on [**2113-4-28**], which showed anginal-type symptoms with probable ischemic electrocardiogram changes.
On [**2113-4-24**], he also had an echocardiogram which showed moderate aortic stenosis, mild aortic regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation, symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic function.
High cholesterol.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
He was also found to have an ejection fraction of 65%, 70% stenosis of the left main, and 2-vessel disease.
Indication for this was aortic stenosis and cardiac catheterization results as well as worsening angina.
The patient had an uncomplicated perioperative period.
With that hematocrit he was also complaining of some dizziness, and this was making ambulating difficult.
On the floor, the patient occasionally had a increased heart rate with some premature ventricular contractions.
On discharge his lungs were clear with some mild crackles at the bases.
