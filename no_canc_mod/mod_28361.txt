On evaluation of her pill bottles, it appears as though she took Zyprexa and Adderall.
Initial EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia at [**Street Address(2) 65762**] depressions in V1 and diffuse ST elevations with PR depressions.
In terms of her overdose, poison control was contact[**Name (NI) **] and patient was monitered for neuroleptic malignant syndrome and anticholinergic effects which was of concern with her Zyprexa overdose, but did not exhibit any of these signs.
Patient was also noted to have Troponin trend from 0.09 night of admission to 0.03 to 4.5.
EKG on 2nd day of hospitalization demonstrated ST elevations in lateral leads which were more pronounced than on admission.
Patient was not placed on heparin gtt as it was believed that this troponin elevation was more likely [**2-9**] strain, as patient had had recent cardiac w/u as outpt that was negative.
Hospital course otherwise notable for some hypoxia with borderline O2 sats on 100% FiO2- CXR at that time demonstrated some evidence of aspiration pna and ?CHF.
Patient also developed hypotension, thought ?
Patient was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for managment of her MI and her pulmonary status.
Depression 2.)
Chronic pain 4.)
100 lb weight loss over past year - pt has undergone extensive w/u including colonoscopy, GYN exam, HIV test, cardiac w/u, stool studies, celiac studies negative.
Also had abd CT negative, Chest CT demonstrated LUL nodule which was monitered.
Had recent scan that demonstrated increase in size of LUL nodule from 3mm->7mm, PET scan in [**12-11**] negative - scheduled to have repeat Chest CT this month.
+ family stress due to death of her son from heroin overdose about 2 years ago.

Left lower lobe pulmonary opacity, likely representing aspiration.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with patent LMCA, LAD that had mild 30% mid vessel lesion, LCx that was without obstructive disease and the RCA had a mid vessel 60% lesion.
Hemodynamic assessment showed low normal RAp, elevated PaP with marked respiratory variation and normal PCWP.
There was systemic hypotension with narrow pulse pressure.
This was consistent with septic shock.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to extensive apical akinesis, with contractile function improving toward the base of the heart.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2108-3-21**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Interval improvement of pulmonary edema.
Interval improvement of bibasilar opacities, which may represent residual changes from aspiration.
Bilateral lower lobe consolidation worrisome for multifocal pneumonia.
Bilateral pleural effusions, and interlobular septal thickening that may suggest fluid overload.
3 mm nodule in the right lower lobe.
There are bibasilar areas of increased opacity adjacent to small-to-moderate pleural effusions.
The left lower lobe opacity is slightly improved in the interval.
The right basilar opacity is difficult to compare due to the increasing effusion and differences in positioning of the patient.
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar consolidation in keeping with history of aspiration pneumonia with interval improvement in left retrocardiac area.
Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment/Plan:  Patient is 59 yo woman without known cardiac history, presented to OSH with suicide attempt o/d on zyprexa and adderall, now intubated w/ pna and course c/b NSTEMI.
# Aspiration PNA/MSSA sepsis:  The patient was started on levo ([**3-19**]) at admission and then added vanc the following day.
She was on levophed for septic shock and has been off for >36hours with SBP in high 80s-100s prior to call-out to the floor.
# Respiratory failure: Pt was initially intubated for airway protection after found unresponsive and subsequently found to have bilateral pneumonia thought to be [**2-9**] aspiration.
The patient was extubated on [**3-23**] and has required high O2, so empirically started short-course prednisone (5days) for presumed COPD exacerbation on [**3-25**].
No history of CAD and per OSH records, had recent cardiac w/u which was negative.
EKG on initial presentation to OSH demonstrates diffuse ST elevation and PR depression.
EKG on day of transfer demonstrates anterolateral ST elevation with reciprical inferior changes.
C. Rhythm:  Was in sinus tachy on presentation, now in NSR.
Seen by poison control at OSH - monitered for neuroleptic malignant syndrome and anticholinergic effects which were not noted.
After extubation, she was placed on CIWA scale and 1:1 sitter for possible alcoholism and SI.
The patient was also evaluated by psych who recommended d/cing 1:1 sitter and CIWA as pt was no longer suicidal and had no previous ETOH abuse.
On discharge from unit, pt was not suicidal and although admits depression and anxiety.
# PPX:  SC heparin, lansoprazole, colace .
Repeat CXR on [**3-26**] showed resolution of her pulmonary edema.
She finished a 5 day course of steroids for putative bronchospasm in the hospital and was maintained on nebulizers.
- Patient was on adderall and topamax as outpatient; these were discontinued and will not be restarted; In particular, the adderall may have played a significant part in the drastic weight loss that the patient has experienced over the past year.
