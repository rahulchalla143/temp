The patient attempted to induce emesis unsuccessfully before falling asleep at 1 a.m.
He was found in the morning by a friend at 10 a.m. unresponsive with agonal slowing respiration pattern with pinpoint pupils.
The patient was intubated at [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Department with no difficulty.
He received additional Narcan with no additional response.
The patient's chest x-ray showed right upper lobe opacity with diffuse patchy opacities bilaterally and no pleural effusion.
Electrocardiogram showed no ST changes and normal sinus rhythm.
On the floor, the patient was hypotensive and started on Dopamine, in addition to requiring multiple fluid boluses on admission.
HEENT exam showed pupils were pinprick and sluggishly reactive.
Chest exam showed diffuse wheezing bilaterally.
Abdomen was soft and nondistended with decreased bowel sounds.
On the night of admission, the patient was noted to have an elevated potassium of 5.8.
Subsequent electrocardiogram showed peak T-waves and ST segment elevation in II, III, and AVF which persisted over multiple electrocardiograms.
Bedside echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis.
The patient's catheterization report showed clean coronaries without any ongoing spasm, no sign of embolus was appreciated.
The patient has a PA pressure of 33/20, wedge of 15, SVR of 639, PVR of 91, with anteroapical inferior global hypokinesis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On admission the patient was intubated for hypoxia and hypercapnia secondary to hypoventilation.
Subsequent chest x-ray was consistent with aspiration versus early ARDS versus narcotic induced pulmonary edema.
Cardiovascularly the patient was on Dopamine for hypotension with ST segment elevations in II, III, and AVF, and elevated troponins.
He was taken to the Catheterization Lab which was negative for any blockage in the patient's coronaries.
Over the next several days, the patient experienced multiple episodes of agitation, bucking the vent, with respiratory rates increasing to the 50s requiring increased boluses of Propofol.
The patient continued to have thick tan secretions.
The patient was given a CT of the chest which showed multiple diffuse bilateral opacities.
CAT scan at that time showed mucosal thickening and soft tissue density without air-fluid levels consistent with sinusitis.
On [**2114-9-23**], the patient subsequently dropped oxygen saturations secondary to mucous plugging and required several therapeutic bronchoscopies.
The patient was found on bronchoscopy to have tenacious secretions in the ET tube, thick mucous plug occluding the left lower lobe orifice which was suctioned out.
All left lower lobe segmental airways were visualized and patent.
Subsequent bronchoscopy showed complete obstruction of bronchus intermedius of the right lower lobe and right middle lobe bronchi with diffuse mucous plugging, complete obstruction of left upper lobe with bronchus plugs, all of which were removed with suction.
Subsequently on the morning of [**9-24**], the patient again desaturated to the 60s with difficulty raising saturations with aggressive bagging.
New third bronchoscopy in the 24-hour period showed complete plugging of left lower lobe which was subsequently suctioned out.
Repeat electrocardiogram showed resolving ST segment elevations in II, III, and AVF, and cardiac enzymes were negative.
Throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, he continued to have moderate-grade fevers anywhere between 101 and 103.
The patient was also given subsequent chest CT which showed small pericardial effusion, leftward shift in the mediastinum, grain-glass opacities, improved from previous chest CT.
The remaining grain-glass opacities found in the left upper lobe and posterior right lower lobe also demonstrated collapse of the left lower lobe, new from chest x-ray of [**9-24**].
The patient's subsequent sputum culture grew out Streptococcus pneumoniae sensitive to Levofloxacin, which the patient was on and continued on.
The patient's PEEP was increased to prevent subsequent collapse of distal airways.
The patient received an additional bronchoscopy which showed secretions without any mucous plugging.
The patient was ordered to have respiratory mechanic study secondary to the patient's difficulty to wean and multiple repeated episodes of desaturation both in the setting of mucous plugging with diagnostic therapeutic bronchoscopy and with negative bronchoscopy.
On around [**2114-9-26**], and [**2114-9-27**], the patient became hypoxic with systolic pressures in the 70s requiring the start of Dopamine and multiple fluid boluses which were slowly weaned.
In the early morning of [**2114-9-30**], secondary to aggressive cough attempt, the patient self-extubated.
The patient became extremely combative and agitated yet maintaining good saturations in the high 90%, thus not requiring reintubation.
Psychiatry concluded that this intoxication appears to be accidental overdose in the setting of multiple mixed substances.
He had no evidence of depression or any other underlying psychiatric disorder.
Aspiration pneumonia.
