He is on currently on hemodialysis and presents for kidney biopsy for rising creatinine.
Past Medical History: ESRD, HTN, s/p kidney transplant [**2148**](LLQ- failed in 2 years, multiple failed accesses, motorcycle accident 3 years ago;left upper leg with thrombus, wound requiring antibiotics/packing, fully healed.
On [**7-24**] the patient underwent renal biopsy: findings are as follows: Glomerulosclerosis ([**4-23**] glomeruli--- at one level); intimal fibroplasia; arteriolar hyaline focal; conspicuous interstitial inflammation with edema component, both acute and chronic; neutrophils in peritubular capillaries; focal tubular necrosis with regenerative change (mitotic figures seen); tubulitis, very limited; mild endothelialitis, focally seen in larger arteries; angiocentric (arterioles) chronic inflammatory infiltrate-- (inflammatory infiltrate surrounds arterioles and focally infiltrates the wall); neutrophils in glomerular [**Hospital1 **]; C4D preparations negative for peritubular staining, but vasa recta positive (C4D positivity in vasa recta, is not evidence of humeral rejection, but supports that the preparation is technically adequate).
---Diagnosis: Suggestive of humeral rejection but lack of  C4D staining presents interpretive problems;  compatible  with cellular rejection; question ATN component; donor pathology present (arteriosclerosis) In addition: Both B and T cell flow XM from [**7-24**] came back negative.
Following the biopsy, the follow-up hematocrit was initially stable, however, by the following mornings' labs, the Hct was down 2% and a serial hematocrit at 11AM showed a drop to 21.5%.
In addition patient was c/o chest pain.
His cardiac enzymes were unremarkable, he still had some c/o chest discomfort so Protonix was increased to [**Hospital1 **] dosing.
Transplant renal U/S performed on [**7-25**] showed significant interval increase in the size of right perinephric hematoma, with most probable active extravasation.
His was last dialyzed on Fri [**7-27**]; no ultrafiltration.
Pt developed right groin hematoma, which became progressively tender and swollen.
No ultrasound was obtained.
