There are no new parenchymal abnormalities in the lungs.
No evidence of CHF or pneumonia.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
Relative upper [**Name2 (NI) 3630**] lucency and splaying of bronchial vasculature is again noted, likely related to underlying COPD.
Left humeral head prosthesis is again noted.
KUB [**2171-8-28**]: Dilated loops of colon with no air seen in the rectum suggestive of colonic ileus or possible toxic megacolon.
Early distal obstruction cannot be excluded secondary to paucity of air noted in the rectum.
No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilation.

KUB [**2171-9-3**]: No abnormally dilated large or small bowel.
Brief Hospital Course: # Dyspnea: COPD exacerbation.
Given lack of chest pain, the progressive nature of her symptoms, and characteristic wheezing, course breath sounds and pursed lip breathing.
Treated as COPD exacerbation.
After pt developed ?SBO (see below), pt's respiratory status worsened [**1-26**] pain/anxiety/possible compression of lungs from hugely distended bowel.
# Abdominal pain/nausea/vomiting:  Pt reports that she had not had a bowel movement in 3 days.

Pt was tachy to 100s and hypertensive to 170s SBP.
Pt received two doses of hydralazine with minimal effect.
Pt had hypoactive bowel sounds.
A portable abd xray noted marked colonic distension which was confirmed on CT abd.
There was no visible free air or colonic tickling but given the marked colonic distension she was transferred to the ICU for emergent evaluation.
Pt has a history of SBO s/p multiple surgeries.
A surgery consult was obtained prior to transfer who felt that this was most likely an ileus and given that she is a poor surgical candidate, recommended endoscopic decompression.
KUB on day of discharge demonstrated no abnormally dilated large or small bowel.
# DM:  Pt's DM has been poorly controlled 200-300 as an outpt.
# Hypertension: While on the floor, continued home regimen of long acting nifedipine 90mg Qday.
