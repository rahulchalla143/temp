Past Medical History: ETOH w/ withdrawl(5-6 beers daily), s/p appy, s/p tib fib fx, bipolar disease  Social History: +EtOH   Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: On Discharge: XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  Pertinent Results: Labs on Admission: [**2166-5-2**] 05:14PM BLOOD WBC-5.0 RBC-2.66* Hgb-9.6*# Hct-27.7* MCV-104* MCH-36.2* MCHC-34.7 RDW-15.2 Plt Ct-106* [**2166-5-2**] 05:14PM BLOOD PT-13.8* PTT-24.0 INR(PT)-1.2* [**2166-5-2**] 05:14PM BLOOD Glucose-164* UreaN-4* Creat-0.4* Na-137 K-4.7 Cl-102 HCO3-27 AnGap-13 [**2166-5-3**] 01:48AM BLOOD Calcium-8.5 Phos-3.9 Mg-1.8  Imaging: CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: The small-to-moderate loculated left pleural effusion appears slightly smaller compared to the examination of [**5-7**], where the effusion was noted to extend superiorly to the apex of the major fissure.
No lung nodules are seen.
There is no right pleural effusion, nor pericardial effusion.
There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar adenopathy.
The exam was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis.
There are extensive post-surgical changes of the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine as previously described on [**5-7**].
The posterior soft tissues are not optimally evaluated, due to artifact from new spinal hardware.
A loculated left pleural effusion appears similar to [**5-7**], slightly decreased in superior extent.
FINDINGS: New anterior spinal fusion hardware spans the previously described compression fracture at L1.
Vertebral body screws extend from the left lateral aspect of the T12 and L2 vertebral bodies, extending just past the midline.
The previously described small, retropulsed fracture fragment along the posterior, superior aspect of the L1 vertebral body is unchanged, again retropulsed by approximately 3 mm.
There is no resulting significant spinal canal stenosis.
Alignment is otherwise clear, with mild persistent angulated kyphosis centered at L1 although improved from the prior study.
At the site of hardware, there is no new fracture.
There is extensive air in the adjacent subcutaneous soft tissues, musculature and within the retroperitoneum and the left perirenal space.
There is no collection to suggest hematoma.
In the visualized portion of the pelvis and abdomen, there is no free fluid.
Visualized structures are grossly unremarkable, given the absence of intravenous contrast material.
No evidence of hardware complication.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
He did have a large amount of pain which was managed with a PCA.
He required a transfusion for a low hematocrit with associated tachycardia.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] had hyponatremia during his hospitalization which was managed with sodium tablets.
Since he currently is requiring pain meds for his surgical pain he will have to wait to go to an alcohol rehab facility.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] had fevers post-operatively.
His fever work-up revealed there was no infectious process present, and the likely etiology was left sided pleural effusion; likely due to surgery performed there.
