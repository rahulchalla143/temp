Admission Date:  [**2106-9-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2106-9-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2023-8-9**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent placement to the third obtuse marginal coronary branch (OM3).
History of Present Illness: The patient is an 83-year-old African American male with a known history of hypertension, dyslipidemia and coronary artery disease who is status-post BMS placement to OM3 in [**2095**].
He presented to the emergency room after two episodes of substernal chest pain.
At that time the patient states that he was sitting, preparing a lesson plan, when he felt a sudden onset of [**8-25**] "sharp" chest pain which radiated to his left shoulder and also involved his left arm.
The pain was "stabbing" and had no association with dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis.
The patient taught a class through the pain and his sub-sternal chest pain resolved without medication.
The following afternoon, the patient had an almost identical episode of pain beginning at 1pm, although it did not involve the left arm and it started while he was walking and doing errands.
As with his episode from the prior afternoon, there was no nausea, shortness of breath, vomiting, diaphoresis, lightheadedness or palpitations associated with this second bout of chest pain.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] states that at his baseline his exercise tolerance is limited only by his knee pain and longstanding osteoarthritis "aches".
He has never had any chest pain or shortness of breath associated with exertion.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] in the ED the patient reported [**3-25**] chest pain and his EKG was notable for ST depressions in V1-V3.
Posterior EKG was done which showed ST elevations in posterior V3-V6.
The ST elevations resolved on repeat EKG with these treatments and the patient's chest pain decreased to [**12-24**] and was stable at that level leading up to his presentation to the CCU.
Of note, the patient had an episode of chest pain in [**2095**] which led to emergent cardiac catheterization with BMS placement to OM3.
He explains his chest pain in [**2095**] as being more severe and intense.
Unfortunately, subsequent to his MI in [**2095**] he endured a frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage immediately after the hospitalization for this procedure which was attributed to a combination of poorly controlled hypertension and several anticoagulants, including ticlid, aspirin, and heparin.
After this CVA he had word finding difficulty, motor impairments, and memory deficits but he states that all of these troubling complications resolved over time and he has no lasting cognitive impairments or focal motor/sensory neurologic handicaps at this time.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
He does have ankle edema which worsens throughout the day and improves with leg elevation as well as chronic intermittent knee aches secondary to a history of osteoarthritis.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -Hyperlipidemia -Glucose intolerance -HTN -Osteoarthritis -Right inguinal hernia, status post repair in [**2068**] -CVA: frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage post-cath while on Ticlid and aspirin -Prostate cancer s/p local radiation .

ST-T wave configuration suggest posterolateral injury/ischemia.
[**2106-9-26**] EKG: Regular atrial rhythm with inverted p-waves in II, III, aVF c/w ectopic atrial pacer and with 1mm ST elevation in V5/V6 and TWI in III .
[**2106-9-27**] CARDIAC CATH (left): Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had 50% stenosis proximally, and diffuse irregularities throughout.
OM3 had a 90% stenosis proximally within the prior stent, with normal flow.
The RCA had a 30% proximal stenosis and a 80% stenosis distally.
There was a 70% stenosis at the bifurcation of the PDA and PLV.
Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection, and no residual stenosis.
[**2106-9-29**]  CXR (PA and Lateral):  Retrocardiac lung areas are free of consolidations, no pneumonias.
Aortic tortuosity, but without signs suggestive of fluid overload.
No pleural effusions.
[**2106-9-28**] RIGHT KNEE X-RAY: Osteophytic changes in all three compartments with considerable joint space narrowing in the medial and patellofemoral joints.
Extensive vascular calcifications.
Similar findings were present on X-rays done [**2104-12-15**] with equivocal progression.
No acute fracture or bone destruction.
[**2106-9-29**] 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Overall impression : mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, the patient is an 83-year-old male with longstanding history of hypertension, dyslipidemia and CAD (prior BMS placement to OM3 in [**2095**]) who developed recurrent chest pain for 2 days and was found to have posterior STEMI on arrival to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2106-9-26**].
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was also marked by a Pseudogout episode and a positive blood culture for coagulase negative staphyococcus which was likely a contaminant as outlined below.
CAD / POSTERIOR STEMI: Mr. [**Known lastname 94783**] initial EKG was notable for ST depressions in V1-V3.
Posterior EKG was done which showed ST elevations in posterior V3-V6.
ST-elevations soon resolved on repeat EKG with medical therapy and the patient's chest pain also abated.
The etiology of his ST elevations followed by complete resolution were thought to have been related to a plaque rupture with spontaneous lysis of resultant thrombus or coronary vasospasm resolved with nitroglycerin.
He underwent successful placement of DES to OM3 coronary branch without any immediate complications.
On physical exam he demonstrated no crackles or rales on lung exam and minimal lower extremity edema.
Post-catheterization ECHO (TTE) done [**2106-9-28**] showed LVEF of 55% with mild diastolic dysfunction (Grade 1), trivial MR, no AS and mild symmetrical LVH.
Fortunately, Mr. [**Known lastname **] had no major akinesis after this ACS/STEMI.
RHYTHM: EKG on hospital day 1 revealed some evidence of ectopic atrial pacer beats  exhibited by inverted p-wave in II, III, aVF with shorter PR.
This was felt to be related to his acute presentation and was not felt to be clinically relevant given that repeat telemetry and EKGs throughout his hospital course showed NSR with no evidence of any prominent arrhythmias.
RIGHT KNEE PAIN - One day after stent placement Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed swollen, warm, tender right knee which was notably effused.
A joint aspiration/tap was performed by the orthopedic service and Mr. [**Known lastname **] was found to have joint fluid calcium pyrophosphate crystals with rhomboid shape that were positively bifringent and consistent with Pseudogout.
The orthopedic team also performed a local injection with Bupivicaine and Cortisone for pain control.
He was pain free and ambulating without difficulty at the time of discharge.
The patient will have secondary benefit from daily ASA, and additional Tylenol can be used for recurrent pain as needed.
The patient was asked to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4304**] [**Name (STitle) 284**] in the orthopedics department who he already sees for his osteoarthritis management if he had a return of his knee pain or effusion in the coming weeks.
Of note, the joint fluid gram stain was negative for any microorganisms and the total WBCs were 26,000 which indicated an inflammatory process but not quite high enough to suspect septic joint.
The patient's right knee x-ray showed no new changes, just his baseline  known osteophytic changes and joint space narrowing with chondrocalcinosis that was equivalent to his [**12/2104**] x-ray.
BACTEREMIA:   The patient had blood cultures drawn on admission on [**2106-9-27**] which revealed [**1-18**] positive samples/cultures with gram positive cocci which were later identified as coagulase negative staphylococcus species.
In the interim the patient was treated with IV Vancomycin for 3 days due to concern for a possible MRSA infection.
Moreover, he had negative urine cultures, negative knee fluid cultures and no noted leukocytosis.
Patient advised to call PCP as soon as possible if he has any recurrent fevers, chills, rigors or develops upper respiratory symptoms such as cough or productive sputum or has dysuria.
STROKE HISTORY : The [**Hospital 228**] medical history is significant for a neurologic event/hemorrhagic CVA which occured in the setting of anticoagulation and hypertension in [**2095**].
He had no evidence of any focal neurological deficits.
HTN - Amlodipine was held and eventually discontinued as the patient had good BP control with SBP ranges in the 120s on uptitrated doses of beta-blockers and ace-inhibitors during his stay.
The patient was asked to continue these 2 medications for his hypertension management.
GLUCOSE INTOLERANCE: The patient has no known diagnosis of DM but he has a prominent family history of DM-2.
He had several high blood sugar levels during his hospital stay.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4390**] (appointment set up for [**2106-10-15**]) for additional diabetic screening and to discuss the need for additional control with medications on an ongoing basis.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was asked to please return to the emergency room or call his new cardiologist or PCP as soon as possible if he had any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness or lightheadedness after discharge.
Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Sublingual every 5 minutes x3, then call 911 as needed for chest pain.
Disp:*30 * Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Right Knee Pseudogout Hypertension Compensated Systolic Heart Failure Hyperglycemia, A1C 7.2   Discharge Condition: Stable, A1C 7.2 BUN 29 Creat 1.0 Hct: 35   Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack and a cardiac catheterization.
You had a bacteria that grew out of one set of blood cultures.
