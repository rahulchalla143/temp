Admission Date:  [**2156-8-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2156-8-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-4-17**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Erythromycin Base / Neosporin Scar Solution / Ampicillin / Tobrex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Placement of a R IJ dialysis catheter CVVH  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 82252**] is an 86yoF with history of severe aortic stenosis, CAD s/p CABG in [**2154**] and RCA stents x3 in [**2148**] recently hospitalized here from [**Date range (1) 52084**] for acute pulmonary edema who now is TF from OSH for management of recurrent pulmonary edema.
For details of her initial presentation see Dr.[**Name (NI) 62137**] admission note from [**2156-8-12**].
Briefly, she presented to OSH with 10/10 chest pain not relieved by nitro x4 and SOB that developed at rest.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and had an echo which showed severe aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] <0.8cm2) with preserved systolic function, AR (1+), MR (2+), TR (2+) and severe PAH.
On the evening she was discharged to her ALF, she again developed acute chest pain and SOB.
She described the pain as [**10-11**] and radiating to her L arm, and associated with diaphoresis.
She notes that the chest pain was the same as the chest pain that she initially presented with, but the SOB was more severe.
When she arrived she was noted to be in severe respiratory distress and was started on BiPAP.
EKG showed sinus tach.
Cards was c/s and felt that CP was likely related to aortic stenosis and not ACS.
She states that her chest pain has resolved and her breathing is comfortable on the BiPAP.
She notes orthopnea c/w her baseline (requires 2 pillows), denies worsening peripheral edema.

Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam: VS on transfer: T= 96.1 BP= 152/61 HR=88 RR=19 O2 sat= 95% on CPAP (50% FIO2) GENERAL: Pleasant, comfortable-appearing, in no acute distress.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
surgical scar s/p right endartrectomy CARDIAC: s/p CABG, RRR, 4/6 systolic crescendo murmur loudest at LUSB radiating to carotids, No r/g.
LUNGS: Bibasilar crackles to mid lung, faint expiratory wheezes.
EXTREMITIES: WWP, no clubbing/cyanosis, trace pedal edema.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Lungs continue to be wheezy on exam with elevated JVP  Pertinent Results: Admission labs: WBC 5.6  Hgb 9.6 Hct 27.5 Plts 211 PT 11.4 PTT 25.7  INR 0.9  Na 140 K 4.7 Cl 99 CO2 23 BUN 70 Cr 4.2 Gluc 209 Ca 8.4 Mag 2.2 Phos 5.2 CK 164 CKMB 12 Trop-T 0.53  ALT 17 AST 32 Alk phos 133 T bili 0.4  Admission studies: CXR: Moderate pulmonary edema, worsened in comparison to prior study from [**2156-8-12**].
EKG: Sinus rhythm, LVH, 1-2mm ST depressions in I, II  TTE [**2156-8-16**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild focal LV systolic dysfunction with antero-lateral hypokinesis.
The remaining segmetns are hyperdynamic and thus overall left ventricular ejection fraction is preserved (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 8 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
At least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-8-12**], no change (the [**Location (un) 109**] was slightly underestimated and regional antero-lateral hypokinesis was present but not commented on for the prior study).
CXR [**2156-8-24**]: Diffuse hazy opacification with cardiomegaly are consistent with pulmonary edema, unchanged in appearance from the prior examination.
A small left pleural effusion is not significantly changed.
No pneumothorax is seen.
A previously seen right central venous line has been removed with no resulting hematoma or mediastinal widening.

# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure - Due to both severe aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation.
She was initially requiring BiPAP to maintain O2sats >90%, but this improved and by discharge she was maintaining O2 sats >90% on NC at 15L/min, with occasional episodes of SOB requiring face mask.
This was later changed to IV dilaudid due to concern for poor clearance in setting of renal failure.
She was then considered for TAVI, but there was concern that she may not be a candidate for the procedure given her known atherosclerosis of femoral vessels and h/o difficult access for cardiac cath.
# CAD - On admission pt c/o chest pain, thought most likely [**2-4**] demand ischemia, low suspicion for ACS given history and absence of ischemic changes on EKG.
ACEi was held in the setting of renal failure.
Chest pain did not recur.
# Acute on chronic RF: Creat increased from 2.2 on previous admission to 4.2, and continued to increase to 6.4.
Creatinine continued to trend upwards and patient continued to have poor urine output.
# Hypertension: BP stable on home amlodipine, and metoprolol.
# Diabetes Mellitus: Patient's blood sugar was well controlled throughout admission on home lantus and insulin sliding scale.
