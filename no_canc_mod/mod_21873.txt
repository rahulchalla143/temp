He is a 60-year-old gentleman with history of rheumatic arthritis and hypercholesterolemia who is a transfer from an outside hospital with an acute anterior MI.
The patient had several episodes of chest tightness without exertion over the last week prior to admission.
EMS arrived and took patient to [**Hospital6 3622**] where anterolateral hyperacute T waves were noted and ST elevations in I, aVL, and V1 through V5.
The patient was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] where catheterization revealed a thrombotic LAD occlusion and the patient underwent CYPHER stent placement.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history, otherwise, is significant for rheumatoid arthritis and hypercholesterolemia.
No ETOH, occasional tobacco, no other drugs.
Generally, the patient is a very pleasant male, in no acute distress.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, and nondistended with no hepatosplenomegaly palpated.
EKG on admission, normal sinus rhythm at 53, ST elevations in I, aVL, and V1 through V5.
After catheterization, the patient had persistent ST elevations.
Right dominant system, LAD 95 percent proximal with thrombus 60 percent, origin of bifurcating D1 diffusely diseased beyond left circumflex, mid lumen irregularities throughout proximal left circumflex and large OM1, OM2 normal, distal left circumflex 70 percent before small OM3; RCA, mild lumen irregularities and ectasia throughout.
Minimal stenosis of 30 percent.
Then, proximal LAD was stented with 3.0 x 30 mm CYPHER drug- eluting stent and post dilated with proximal two-third of stent with 3.9 x 9 mm NC ranger at 16 atm.
Final result is zero percent residual in-stent, no compromise to first septal or origins, normal flow noted.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Acute anterior MI was managed successfully with primary angioplasty and drug-eluting stent placement.
Left atrium was normal in size, but mildly elongated.
Mild symmetric LVH with following wall motion abnormalities noted:  Anterior apex, akinetic; septal apex, akinetic; apex akinetic.
By the time of discharge, the patient was maintained on aspirin, Plavix, Coumadin for apical akinesis, Lopressor, and lisinopril.
Coronary artery disease.
Rheumatoid arthritis.
The patient is to remain on Coumadin due to akinesis of his heart apex and will need to do the INR checked regularly.
He has had no further episodes of chest pain, no active pain in telemetry, and is hemodynamically stable.
