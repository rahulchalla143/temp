Admission Date:  [**2158-12-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-12-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-1-23**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Erythromycin Base  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: SOB and epigastric burning  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent to the right coronary artery.
History of Present Illness: This is a 66 y/o F with h/o HTN and carotid disease s/p R CEA (in [**2155**]) who initially presented to OSH with shortness of breath and epigastric burning.
This started while patient was vomiting (non-bilious/non-bloody) and worsened when she walked around home.
Stated that nausea/vomiting/epigastric pain had been presented with "few days" prior to admission.
On day of presentation, pain was worsening, so she decided to come into hosptial.
Per report from OSH, EKG had Q waves in inferior leads and ST depressions in V3-V6.
Patient continued to have chest discomfort and was started on nitro paste.
Of note patient also had mechanical fall down 4 stairs and had struck head.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient was taken directly to cath lab where an echo was performed showing hypokinesis of inferolateral wall with LVEF 50-55%.
Cath showed RCA proximal thrombotic occlusion.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Carotid disease s/p Right CEA in [**2155**] - GERD - s/p eye surgery - Osteoporosis - COPD - Anxiety  Social History: Patient is a country line dancer instructor.
Appears tired and complains of cold hands.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No JVD appreciated.
No carotid bruits auscultated.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities.
B/L crackles to mid-lungs; no wheezes or rhonchi.
No abdominial bruits.
No skin turgor.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Low limb lead voltage.
Non-diagnostic Q waves in the inferior leads with mild ST segment elevation.
There is mild ST segment depression in leads I and aVL as well as in the precordial leads.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Since the previous tracing of [**2158-12-11**] inferior ST segment elevation is less prominent.
ST segment depression in leads I and aVL is less prominent.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls and mid inferior wall.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction and basal right ventricular free wall hypokinesis c/w CAD (proximal RCA distribution).
Moderate mitral regugitation most likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Chest PA and Lateral [**2158-12-12**] IMPRESSION: Absence of marked cardiac enlargement but upper zone  redistribution, interstitial basal emphysema and moderate amount of bilateral pleural effusion consistent with CHF of moderate duration.
Nonsignificant enlargement of the heart silhouette is not unusual in acute MIs.
On the obtained AP and lateral view, no significant intracardiac calcifications can be identified.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 60 year lady with history of HTN, carotid disease status post right CEA initially presenting with dypsnea and epigastric pain and was found to have an NSTEMI and is status post cathtereization and placement of a bare metal stent to the right coronary artery.
# CORONARIES:  Ruled in for NSTEMI / MI with elevated troponin and involvement of right heart at an outside hospital.
Metoprolol initially held given hypotension and started prior to discharge.
# PUMP / Hypotension: Prior to transfer she was hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in 80s.
Echo prior to procedure showing LVEF of 50-55% and hypokinesis of inferolateral wall.
She is likely preload dependent with a dysfunctional RV and required initial 2 liter fluid resuscitation and was on a dopamin gtt for less than 24 hours.
# GERD: Switched to ranitidine daily, to avoid PPI/clopidogrel interaction.
# Osteoporosis: Started Calcium and vitamin D .
# Depression/Anxiety: Continued citalopram and ativan   Medications on Admission: - Prempro daily - Flovent MDI [**Hospital1 **] - Citalopram 20mg daily - Xanax 0.25mg Daily - Zocor  Discharge Medications: 1. aspirin 325 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
Disp:*30 Tablet Sustained Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital1 1474**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Mitral Regurgitation Hypertension Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack and received a bare metal stent to your right coronary artery.
Your heart function is close to normal but we noticed that you have a leaky mitral valve that could have been caused by the heart attack.
It is important that your high blood pressure is controlled and you eat a heart healthy diet.
Stop taking Prempro, this increases your risk of a heart attack 2.
