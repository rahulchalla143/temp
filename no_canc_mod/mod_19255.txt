Admission Date:  [**2179-9-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-10-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2114-8-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: Chest Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catherterization Thoracentesis with pleurex catheter Upper Endoscopy Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter placement   History of Present Illness: 65 yo male with very complicated medical history presents to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH after developing 6/10 chest pain today at rehab.
States pain began around 3 am while he was lying in bed.
Denies every having a similar pain in the past, rates the pain [**8-13**] in severity.
Patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for a prolonged hospitalization from [**7-14**] to [**8-20**] for mesenteric ischemia complicated by myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, duodenal angioectasia, and presumed MRSA pneumonia.
During that stay, he underwent an exploratory laparotomy, segmental ileal resection, and mesenteric vessel exploration, with successfuly stenting of the SMA.
He also underwent resection of 8 cm distal ileum, terminal ileum and right colon resulting in ileotransverse colostomy.
Following surgery, he was found to have troponin elevation to .62, with normal CKs, ST depressions on EKG.
The LMCA had a distal 70% lesion, LAD had an 80% ostial lesion with mid/distal 80% lesion, and LCx had an occluded OM2 with collateral filling.
The RCA was proximally occluded with left coronary collaterals.
He was evaluated by CT [**Doctor First Name **] for CABG, but thought to be a high risk candidate given his comorbidities and active illness, and the decision was made for medical management with reevaluation for CABG after recovery.
Today the patient was initially taken to [**Hospital3 12594**], found to have ST depressions in anterior leads on EKG, positive troponin of 1.76.
He was given lasix for presumed CHF, heparin, beta-blocker, and aspirin, started on nitro gtt for persistent chest pain and subsequently became hypotensive.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the patient was chest pain free, EKG showed ST depressions II, V4-V5, TWI II, III, avF, V4-V5.
He became hypotensive to 70's systolically, LIJ placed and dopamine started.
Pt demonstrated signs of altered mental status, and the heparin was stopped until an emergent head CT could be obtained.
LAD showed ostial 80%, LCX diffuse 60-70% stenosis with total occlusion of distal OM1.
Further review of symptoms negative for prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He does note right hand tremor when he is cold and left arm weakness and numbness since his last hospitalization.
Denies feeling lightheaded or dizzy.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, positive for chronic dyspnea, no orthopnea, no palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Skin: Stage II decubitus ulcer on buttock Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; PT and DP dopplerable Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; DP and PT dopplerable  Pertinent Results: Admission EKG demonstrated: SR, LAD, poor R wave progression, nml intervals, ST depressions II, V4,V5 .
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
The LAD had an 80% ostial lesion with mid/distal 80% lesion.
The LCx system had an occluded OM2 with collateral filling.
The RCA was  proximally occluded with left coronary collaterals.
Sytemic arterial systolic and diastolic pressures were normal.
Left ventriculography revealed no mitral regurgitation, mild global hypokinesis, and LVEF of 45%.
Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
Successful PCI of the mid left anterior descending artery.
[**2179-10-6**]  BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ARTERIAL VASCULAR EXAMINATION: IMPRESSION: There is a widely patent right femoral to popliteal artery bypass graft.
No evidence of thrombus is seen within the bypass graft .
There are bilateral pleural effusions and patchy airspace and interstitial disease bilaterally consistent with mild-to-moderate heart failure.
LABORATORY DATA:  see below, notable for leukocytosis with bandemia, anemia, hypokalemia, transaminitis, elevated BNP.
Vessels- known 3-VD from previous cardiac cath, had been medically managed, now with recurrent chest pain and NSTEMI.
S/P cardiac cath with BMS of LMCA/LAD and PTCA of OM1.
Intially beta-blocker/ACEi were held secondary to hypotension.
The patient remained chest pain free throughout hospitalization.
CHF- has a history of HF with EF >55% in [**July 2179**], a new Echo showed moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %).
During this admission, patient developed a large left right sided pulmonary effusion secondary to decompensated HF.
Rhythm- patient with multiple episodes of MAT during hospitalization, and one episode of atrial tachycardia with HR of 200s.
This was thought to be most likely due to hypoxia vs. ischemic damage.
# [**Name (NI) **] unclear etiology, differential included hypovolemia from overdiuresis at the OSH, cardiogenic shock, septic shock given open wound and leukocytosis although lactate normal and afebrile.
Patient became hypotensive again with chest tube on [**9-30**], but these transient hypotensive episodes resolved when the chest tube was removed.
Pt was brought back to the catheterization lab, and was found to have an occluded aortobifemoral graft occclusion.
The patient had a b/l femoral u/s which revealed a free floating thrombus in the right fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] graft.
However following 3 weeks, his hospital course was additionally complicated by a GIB (see below) and thus a repeat ultrasound was performed to evaluate for the possibility of a persistent thrombi.
The repeat ultrasound showed a patent graft and thus coumadin was discontnued.
# Leukocytosis- On admission, pt had a bandemia.
Patient had repeat sputum sent in setting of questionable infiltrate on CXR.
He remained afebrile following his antibiotic treatment.
# Acute upper GI bleed.
He had an urgent EGD on [**10-5**] which revealed small AVMs in the gastric mucosa.
He had no further episodes of GIB and he remained hemodynamically stable throughout the rest of his hospital course.
# Respiratory failure- unable to wean from vent during last admission, thought to be secondary to hypercarbia and respiratory muscle fatigue, he was s/p trach.
On admission, patient had worsening CXR with complete right lung collapse, w/ pleural effusions and evidence of consolidation.
Interventional pulm was consulted and the patient's effusion was then tapped with over 4L of fluid removed.
Of note, his creatnine was 1.3 on discharge, likely secondary to diuresis.
He was also started on megace due to persistent poor appetite.
There was significant improvement of his PO intake on discharge and he was discharged with plans for weaning from tube feeding.
# Diabetes Mellitus:  He was discharged home on a regimen of NPH [**12-10**].
Of note during his hospital course, he had one episode of hypoglycemia to 33 on the above NPH regimen.
This was in the setting of poor caloric intake and thus his NPH dose was adjusted.
