Admission Date:  [**2153-2-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-3-3**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Amoxicillin / Levofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**] Chief Complaint: altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Ms.[**Known lastname 100305**] is an 87 year old female with a h/o CAD s/p PCI, htn, hyperlipidemia, breast cancer s/p lumpectomy and XRT who presents with altered mental status.
She noted her symptoms initially started with a cough around [**Holiday **] time and then resolved.
However, she began to note chest congestion recurring the first week of [**Month (only) 404**].
After her symptoms persisted for a week and she developed urinary symptoms she went to [**Company 191**] for evaluation.
She was given a prescription for levaquin 250 mg daily x 10 days for cystitis as well as possible bronchitis.
Patient is unable to provide detailed history due to confusion.
She remained asymptomatic without HA, vision changes, chest pain, SOB, or other concerns.
CXR was performed without clear infiltrate although there was some haziness of the R heart border.
Upon arrival to the floor, she is in no acute distress but knows she is confused.
She notes being tired and having a cough but is otherwise without complaint.

chronic active colitis by biopsy [**11/2142**] # Hypothyroidism # s/p appendectomy   Social History: The patient lives alone in the [**Hospital3 4414**], but she does live in the same building as her sister.
[**Name (NI) **] son in [**Name (NI) 3786**] is her major source of social support.
Family History: noncontributory  Physical Exam: T: 98.5 BP: 180/84 HR: 56 RR: 16 O2 98% RA Gen: Pleasant, elderly female in NAD HEENT: No icterus.
PERRL NECK: Supple, No JVD.
Mildly dsyarthric.
[**2153-2-25**] CXR IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
If there is a clinical suspicion for an acute infarction, then MRI would be helpful.
Chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
Please correlate clinically to exclude acute sinusitis.
[**2153-2-26**] CXR IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**2153-2-25**] URINE CULTURE (Final [**2153-2-26**]):    NO GROWTH.
Abnormal T2 signal in bilateral hippocampi with enhancement in the left hippocampus.
These findings are suggestive of extra pontine myelinolysis.
Differential might also include encephalitis or a hypoxic episode, but clinical correlation is advised.
Small vessel ischemic disease.

# Altered MS:  This was initially thought to be most likely secondary to hyponatremia (see below).
However as the patient continued to have persistent confusion after correction of sodium levels, it was thought that she might have a component of sundowning in the ICU.
After transfer to the floor, as confusion continued (pt was mostly AOx1 to self only) MRI Head was checked, which showed abnormal signal and enchancement in the hippocampus.
Myelinolysis, ischemia, or encephalitis was in the differntial.
Neuro was consequently consulted, and LP was performed to rule out infectious etiology.
Pt was empirically started on IV Acyclovir pending results of viral testing.
Pt continued to remain afebrile without leukocytosis.
She has had no abdominal pain or diarrhea, and CT head on admission was negative for bleed or mass.
She remained without new focal neurological deficits.
# Hyponatremia:  Likely secondary to SIADH of unknown etiology.
Only new medication recently is levofloxacin (for presumed UTI), so SIADH secondary to Levofloxacin is possible but it has not been traditionally associated with SIADH.
CT Head and CXR were both negative for mass (pt has hx of breast CA.)
She has no prior h/o hyponatremia.
Urine electrolytes were consistent with SIADH, and sodium did not improve with fluid challenge.
The patient was treated with hypertonic saline in the ICU with resolution of the hyponatremia at an appropriate rate.
Pt has a prolonged history of URI symptoms including minimally productive cough and possible fevers and chills.
There was no significant leukocytosis to suggest infection on this admission.
Also, no sign of infiltrate on CXR.
Pt has remained afebrile throughout stay.
AG of 18 on admission labs was likely from elevated lactate of 2.4.
Delta-delta of 6 suggested underlying metabolic alkalosis in addition to possible AGMA.
# CAD: s/p multiple PCIs.
Utility of continuing Atenolol further given hx of CAD and PCIs should be discussed with PCP.
# HTN: Pt presented with hypertensive urgency in the ED.
As BP remained elevated on the floor particularly in the evenings, Valsartan was increased to 80mg PO bid.
# Anemia: Crit on admission reflected a microcytic anemia slightly below baseline.
Pt had no evidence of acute blood loss during stay.
# Hypercholesterolemia: Stable.
# h/o breast cancer: s/p lumpectomy and XRT.
No evidence of recurrence at this time.
# CODE: FULL, confirmed w/ HCP .
You were found to have low blood sodium levels, which were likely contributing to your confusion.
Your confusion persisted, so you had an MRI of the Head, which showed some swelling in your brain.
