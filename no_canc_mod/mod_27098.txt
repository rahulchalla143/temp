Described pain as dull ache/pressure with radiation to back and both arms.
She also reports pain in R leg w/ distance walking.
Pt presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] for evaluation of CP and had ST elevations 2mm or greater in V1-V3.
Cath revealed LAD 80% lesion that was stented x2 (Cypher).
Pt also noted to have R iliac disease and had stenting of R iliac dissection and stenosed L iliac.
Past Medical History: HTN tobacco use obesity hypercholesterolemia  Pertinent Results: CHEST - PORTABLE AP ([**2147-2-10**]): The heart size is within normal limits for technique.
No focal consolidations on the visualized lung fields (left costophrenic angle excluded).
There is slight prominence of the superior mediastinum which may reflect supine positioning.
LCx: gave rise to a small AV groove Cx and a large branching OM1.
There were only mild luminal irregularities in these vessels.
RCA: proximal 80% stenosis and then a serial 60% stenosis in the mid segment.
Resting hemodynamics: elevated right heart filling pressures and moderate to severe elevation of left heart filling pressures.
There was moderate to severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
The calculated cardiac output by the Fick method was 4.8 L/min with a cardiac index of 2.4. .
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include mid to distal anteroseptal akinesis and apical akinesis/hypkinesis (apex not fully visualized).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusi**PRESSURES .

With considerable difficulty, a Magic Torque wire was ultimately passed through the center of the udeployed part of the stent and then progressively dilated with a 3.0x40 mm Sailor balloon, a 6.0x20 mm Agiltrac balloon and a 7.0x20 mm Diamond balloon.
Final angiography showed no residual stenosis, no dissection and normal flow.
Initial angiography of the left coronary artery showed an interval occlusion of OM1 with fresh thrombus.
The patient developed chest pain and ventricular bigeminy.
In retrospect, thrombus was noted on the Magic Torque wire after the exchange for the JL4 catheter, potentially leading to an embolic occlusion of the vessel.
A very small lower pole of OM1 had  signficant residual thrombus but we elected to leave the branch occluded given its small caliber.
Final angiography showed no residual stenosis, no dissection and TIMI 3 flow.
The procedure was complicated by right iliac artery dissection which was successfully treated with stenting.
Transthoracic echocardiography during hospitalization was significant for an ejection fraction of 50%, with anteroseptal and apical akinesis / hypokinesis (results detailed above).
The patient developed chest pain and ventricular bigeminy, and on retrospect, it was felt that thrombus that had developed on the lead wire had embolized to the OM1.
Integrillin was started, and the lesion was balloon dilated with resolution of flow, and distal migration of residual thrombus to a very small lower pole OM1.
She remained chest pain free following cath and was discharged in good condition.

Please call 911 should you develop any new chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other serious symptoms.
Please make sure you have your kidney function and potassium checked at that visit.
