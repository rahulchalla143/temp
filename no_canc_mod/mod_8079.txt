#  Hematemesis - Developed hematemesis of 150 cc after transfusion of 3 units PRBCs.
Given history of grade 1 varices (no history of bleed) and hypertensive gastropathy, patient was started on ceftriaxone, and transferred to ICU for closer monitoring and EGD.
He reported no episodes of hematemesis or change in bowel habits.
Colonoscopy recommended as outpatient when hip fracture healed.
We managed his low hematocrit with transfusions as above.
On transfer to the ICU he was noted to have tense ascites and his urine output was declining.
# ARF - his creatinine increased to 1.5 while inpatient, his baseline is likely 1.2-1.3.
This was felt due to hypoperfusion of the kidneys due to low hematocrit.
# EtoH Cirrhosis: Initially continued cipro on admission for continued SBP prophylaxis.
No paracentesis was performed on admission as patient had no leukocytosis, fever or abdominal pain.
diuretics initially held pending evaluation of GI bleed and subsequently hematemesis.
He is to go home and resume his home dose of Ciprofloxacin 250 mg Tab 1 Tablet(s) by mouth for prophylaxis.
