Admission Date:  [**2139-1-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-1-19**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3507**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxemia and S/P fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 84 yo M with h/o dementia, Parkinson's, CAD, CHF (EF 30%) presents following a fall w/ 3 days of worsening shortness of breath since his discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2139-1-9**].
He denies lightheadedness/dizziness, chest pain prior to the falls and says that his walker slipped ahead of him.
Also of note, his daughter reports that around the time of these episodes he had significant sweats and chills.
In the ED, BNP was found to be [**Numeric Identifier 31854**], but CXR did not reveal gross volume overload.
Cardiac enzymes showed elevated troponin (but this is at his baseline given his acute on chronic renal failure) and CKs were flat.
Given his elevated lactate and recent h/o sweats and rigors, he received vancomycin and zosyn for broad coverage although there currently is no clear source of infection.
Parkinson's 4. s/p ICD for history syncope 4. mild BPH 5. neurogenic bladder 7. h/o embolic CVA - on chronic coumadin 8.
Anemia (BL 34-36) 13.
HTN 15.
Atrial fibrillation 16.
Hyperlipidemia   Social History: Lives at home with his wife.
HEENT: PERRL Neck: No JVD appreciated.
BS left lung base, no wheezes/rales/rhonchi Abd: +BS, soft, NT, ND Ext: 1+ edema b/l, midfoot to toes b/l cool, b/l fingers cool, cyanotic Neuro:  + pill rolling tremor right hand > left, right foot with tremor.
There are no effusions.
There is a mildly displaced left lateral eighth rib fracture with air in the adjacent subcutaneous tissues.
In the absence of penetrating trauma, this could possibly represent a small pneumothorax.
There is no evidence of pneumonia.
IMPRESSION: Left-sided rib fracture with question of small pneumothorax .
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial  septum is seen at rest c/w a small secundum atrial septal defect.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis/thinning of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The severity of mitral regurgitation is now incresaed.
Low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism.
Evidence of activity in the arterial system as demonstrated by increased activity in the brain and kidneys consistent with a right to left shunt.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Left subclavian transvenous right atrial pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are in standard placements, unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: # Hypoxemia: On admission, CXR did not reveal pulmonary edema nor infiltrate to suggest CHF, despite elevated BNP, or pneumonia as contributors to his hypoxemia.
Because of the worsening right heart function, a V/Q scan was pursued given persistent concern for PE (renal failure prevented CTPA).
V/Q scan performed [**1-15**] showed low probability of PE so heparin gtt was d/c'd.
Additionally, V/Q scan revealed e/o R-->L shunt, thus suggesting shunt as likely cause of his transient, posititionally related hypoxemia.
Left sided pneumothorax from left 8th rib fracture was evaluated by thoracics in the ED and remained stable on follow up imaging.
# Pneumothorax: [**1-30**] to left 8th rib fracture.
# CHF: [**2139-1-14**] EF was found to be depressed slightly to 25% compared to EF 30% on echo [**10-2**].
He was found to have worsened RV function on this echo, but as above, V/Q scan showed low probability for PE.
Clinically and on CXR he did not appear to be fluid overloaded and his lasix was held in the setting of elevated creatinine from baseline and presumed prerenal picture in the setting of persistent diuresis with lasix in setting of poor PO just prior to admission.
# CAD:  Elevated troponin on admission, but this is within his BL range in the setting of his acute on chronic renal failure.
EKG did not reveal e/o acute ischemic changes and CKs were flat.
Coumadin held (discussed with family) because of fall risk.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline creatinine appears 1.4-1.5; admission creatinine was 1.9.
Rather, in the setting of poor PO x several days and continuation of his standing lasix dose, he appeared prerenal and intravascularly dry.
# S/P fall: By history, sounds to be mechanical as patient reports walker sliding out from in front of him.
#Tachy-brady: s/p pacemaker.
The patient was doing well on the floor with no change in clinical status.
He was found to be pulsesless and not breathing.
On the monitor, he was still found to have a paced rhythm but again, no pulse was palpated.
