She had diverticulitis with colovesicular fistula in [**2169**] that required partial colonic resection and an ileostomy.
In [**2170-12-4**], she had the ileostomy reversed and since then, she has had worsening of her diarrhea.
Of note this morning, she had flash pulm edema and was given 40mg IV lasix with [**2162**]+cc urine output.
CXR was consistent with significant pulm edema.
Because of her hypoxia from CHF and likely PNA (leukocytosis, low grade fever, sputum, cough), she was transferred to the MICU for further care.
At the OSH, she was started on sucrulfate for gastritis, reglan for mild gastroparesis and nortyptilline.

No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Aortic valve sclerosis.
Diffusely well-defined ground-glass opacity in the lungs with some of interspersed normal lung likely represent infection or ARDS.
Additional edema in the pelvis superior to the Foley catheter may represent fat necrosis or focal omental infarct.
Unusual course of small bowel in posterior to the descending colon may be secondary to prior surgery or due to a internal hernia through congenital defect in sigmoid mesocolon (intersigmoid hernia).
Multiple calcified mediastinal and hilar nodes likely represents sarcoid or less likely old granulomatous disease.
[**4-23**] CXR The left internal jugular line tip is at the superior SVC.
There is slight interval additional improvement in the parenchymal opacities that might represent a process of fluctuation of superimposed pulmonary edema giving the more involvement of the lung parenchyma than on for example [**2172-4-18**] or [**2172-4-20**], although note is made that the improvement of the lung parenchyma may lag after clinical improvement.
There is slightly more lucent area in the right suprahilar area that may represent either parenchyma or a pneumatocele that might be further observed on the subsequent studies.
Brief Hospital Course: 80 F with CAD, CHF, CVA, ILD, COPD and multiple abdominal surgeries transfer from OSH for 2nd opinion of diarrhea who was admitted to MICU for hypoxia, now s/p intubation and extubation.
Respiratory distress Etiology is unclear.
Initial event was likely related to pneumonia and ARDS.
Afib: She alternated between afib w/ rvr and sinus rhythm.
Has had extensive w/u without diagnosis.
Microscopic colitis is under consideration and biopsies are pending at OSH.
Gastrin elevated, 5HIAA minimally elevated from OSH; VIP from OSH pending.
Pancreatic insufficiency should also be considered.
Stool Osm gap 66, more suggestive of a secretory diarrhea.
XR c/w fracture but unclear timing.
