Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated 3-vessel coronary artery disease.
The Lcx gave rise to a small OM that was totally occluded and filled late via left to left collaterals.
There was a mid vessel 60% stenosis.
There was a thrombotic occlusion of the distal RCA which was an ectatic vessel throughout.
Resting hemodynamics revealed significantly elevated right and left heart filling pressures (RA mean 17mmHg, PCW mean 19mmHg).
There was severe pulmonay artery hypertension (PASP=80mmHg PADP=33mmHg PA mean=48mmHg).
Three vessel coronary artery disease with culprit vessel for NSETMI likely RCA thrombosis.
Elevated left and right heart filling pressures consistent with LV diastolic and systolic dysfunction given low cardiac output.
Severe pulmonary artery hypertension with increased pulmonary vascular resistence.
TTE [**2139-3-10**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid- and distal septal, anterior, and basal inferior akinesis.
There is moderate hypokinesis of the remaining segments, most c/w multivessel CAD (LVEF = 25%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe regional and global left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD.
Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
Severe pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-6-10**], LV systolic function has substantially deteriorated, primarily due to inferior wall akinesis.
Mitral and tricuspid regurgitation have increased in severity and pulmonary pressures are higher.
Carotid U/S: Findings are consistent with less than 40% stenosis bilaterally.
Somewhat reduced velocities were seen in the vertebral arteries bilaterally.
Viable myocardium in the anterolateral wall and anterior portion of the apex with left ventricular dilation.
Mildly decreased FDG avidity in the remainder of the myocardium.
This could represent non viable myocardium due to an interval infarct.
A more recent perfusion study may be helpful to evaluate global myocardial perfusion.
LUL 15 mm nodule, could represent focal atelectasis.
Recommend short interval dedicated chest CT for follow-up.
Stenting of distal RCA could be done if recurrent ischemia 5.
Retroperitoneal bleeding from a small [**Last Name (un) **] of inferior epigastric artery.
Successful coil embolization of the inferior epigastric artery to control the course of retroperitoneal bleeding.
Large right retroperitoneal hematoma from right groin, extending to right rectus muscle into the right retroperitoneum, up to the tip of the liver.
Small amount of hemorrhage seen in the cul-de-sac.
No hematoma below the inguinal ligament.
Bilateral small pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
Innumerous renal hypodensities and small cysts.
Given technique, there is no significant interval change compared to prior.
There is a pacemaker with two leads projecting over the heart in expected locations.
There is moderate cardiomegaly.
There is increased retrocardiac opacity that could be due to volume loss/infiltrate/effusion.
CT head [**3-15**]: No acute intracranial pathologic process.
Specifically no evidence of hemorrhage or recent infarction.
Little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs and the pacemaker device.
Brief Hospital Course: 82-year-old female with HTN, DM, CAD s/p VF arrest with anterior STEMI and LAD stenting in [**4-5**], pacemaker placement, h/o TIA, who presents from [**Hospital3 **] with NSTEMI, now s/p PCI with 2 DES to prox LAD ISR, and POBA/export thrombectomy of RCA, procedure complicated by retroperitoneal bleed s/p coiling of inferior epigastric artery, and delirium.
# NSTEMI with stenting, complicated by retroperitoneal bleed: pt presented with typical chest pain, cardiac enzymes peaked (trop 0.94).
After a long discussion between CT surgery, patient, and her family they decided not to pursue CABG given high risk of procedure and pt's wishes.
She underwent a FDG PET cardiac viability study which showed viable myocardium in the anterolateral wall and anterior portion of the apex, and decreased FDG activity in the rest of the myocardium.
Post-cath course was complicated by RP bleed which was seen on CT, pt was taken back to cath lab and had successful coil embolization of the inferior epigastric artery to control the course of retroperitoneal bleeding.
After the procedure the patient complained of back pain, was found to have a 5 point hematocrit drop and evidence of a large right-sided retroperitoneal bleed on CT. She was immediately taken back to the cath lab, and the bleeding artery (right inferior epigastric) was succesfully embolized with coils.
After return to the floor, pt did not have any chest, back, or abdominal pain.
She did not have shortness of breath or any events on telemetry.
Her amlodipine 5mg was changed to lisinopril 5mg for myocardial protection.
# Delirium: pt developed altered mental status and hypoactivity after transfer from CCU.
Though delirium was likely related to ICU stay and hospitlization in a patient with some underlying dementia, we pursued work-up of other etiologies.
Pt underwent speech/swallow evaluation which found dysphagia (likely due to inattention rather than mechanical causes).
Pt slowly improved daily with increased alertness and orientation, though continued to be below baseline per family.
Neurology was consulted and believes that encephalopathy is likely hospital-related delirium vs post-cath microemboli vs medication-related (oxycodone and gabapentin were held after pt developed altered mental status).
She was slightly lethargic but easily arousable and interactive.
# Chronic systolic heart failure (last EF 25 % in [**2134**], now LV systolic function has substantially deteriorated, primarily due to inferior wall akinesis.
Mitral and tricuspid regurgitation have increased in severity and pulmonary pressures are higher).
INACTIVE ISSUES: ---------------- # Hypertension - BP elevated to 180s/80s on admission, she was started on nitro gtt with improvement to SBP 130s/80s.
# Spinal Stenosis: pt has chronic pain from spinal stenosis, she was recently started on Ultram for pain at home which caused her GI upset.
She can continue on low dose oxycodone when her mental status improves.
TRANSITION OF CARE: ------------------- # Pulmonary nodule - PDG viability study showed LUL 15 mm nodule, which could represent focal atelectasis.
Recommend short interval dedicated chest CT for follow-up.
# NG tube - pt was discharged with NG tube and tube feeds due to dysphagia in setting of delirium.
# Pain control - as above, has spinal stenosis pain.
Took Ultram prior to admission with GI upset.
Had good pain control initially with oxycodone, which was held after altered mental status developed.
4. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
10. lidocaine 5 %(700 mg/patch) Adhesive Patch, Medicated Sig: One (1) Adhesive Patch, Medicated Topical DAILY (Daily): please place on back for spinal stenosis pain.
11. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain, headache.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: NSTEMI Retroperitoneal bleed Delirium Congestive heart failure  Secondary: Hypertension Diabetes type 2 Spinal stenosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with chest pain and we found that you had a heart attack.
You had successful stenting of your coronary arteries, but developed a small bleed in your abdomen which we repaired.
After the procedure, you developed some confusion and disorientation which is likely caused by delirium from being in the hospital.
You were having difficulty swallowing and an evaluation of your swallowing showed that you were aspirating food and drink into your lungs.
