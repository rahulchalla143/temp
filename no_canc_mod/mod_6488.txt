She received multiple IV boluses of lopressor as well as 25mg PO x 2 with eventual decrease in heart rates to 100s.
She was noted to have several bradycardic episodes to 30s ([**3-17**] second pauses) with blood pressures remaining in 100s.
While speaking to the resident this morning, she again developed heart rates in the 30s and reported feeling dizzy and became diaphoretic.
She also had a single 10 second pause at dialysis today also associated with some lightheadedness.
She was also noted to have pauses on telemetry.
Thus, this was discontinued and by report, she has not been troubled by rapid heart rates.
Cardiology (EP) was consulted for possible tachy-brady syndrome and the possible need for a pacemaker On cardiac review of symptoms, she denies chest pain.
She does report occasional dizziness at home and at hemodialysis, exertional SOB and [**Location (un) **].
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Family History: The patient's father died secondary to coronary artery disease at the age 66.
The patient's sister died at age 51 secondary to myocardial infarction.
The patient's mother has diabetes mellitus.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Slight bibasilar crackles.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %).
There is considerable beat-tobeat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**2-13**] +) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2116-2-10**], left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation is now present.
# Tachy-brady syndrome - The patient presented symptoms and telemetry consistent with tachy brady syndrome.
# PAD - S/P angioplasty of left iliac and profunda after initially presenting with symptoms of ischemia to the vascular service.
# ESRD - Continued on MWF dialysis.
Had one episode of hypotension at dialysis after she was dialyzed to below her dry weight after a change in scale.
# Hypothyroidism - Continued on home levothyroxine.
Oxazepam 15 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 2255**] [**Name (NI) 2256**]  Discharge Diagnosis: # Tachy-brady syndrome # End Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis # Coronary Artery Disease # Peripheral Arterial disease # Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You have came to us with arrthymia of the heart.
We noted that your heart sometimes goes fast, while other times goes slow.
It is corrected by placement of a pacemaker, which was done without complications.
No showers or baths until after you are seen in the device clinic.
Cephalexin, an antibiotic, started to prevent infection at the pacer site.
If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, bleeding or swelling at the pacer site, fever, nausea, chill, please contact your Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
