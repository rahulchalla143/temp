RH female with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, ulcerative colitis and known left tempoparietal brain abscess s/p stereotactic brain abscess drainage on [**2184-3-8**] who presented to ED with multiple brain abscessed.
She was recently found have thrombocytopenia and ceftriaxone was changed to penicillin.
However, she was found to have Heparin-Induce Thrombocytopenia.
She had a head CT yesterday which showed multiple ring enhancing lesion.
On review of systems patient reports chills and rigors.
She has no visual loss or paresthesia.
No chest pain, abdominal pain or SOB.
Past Medical History: -HTN -HLD -Ulcerative colitis - per PCP/GI doc, trivial 15-30 cm of colitis in distal sigmoid sparing rectum.
Pathology showed mild IBD.
-Femur fracture s/p rod + pins ([**9-/2183**]) -viral tongue lesion (dx 1 month ago) - s/p biopsy and ~4 wks abx -left cheeck skin cancer s/p topical/surgical removal - unclear if basal cell vs melanoma.

The findings are concerning for recurrent or expanding infection.
Possible prior septal myocardial infarction, age undetermined.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary repolarization changes.
Multiseptated, multiloculated peripherally enhancing lesion in left temporoparietal lobe is suggestive of an abscess with associated significant perilesional edema causing mass effect on the atrium and body of left lateral ventricle.
Changes of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
DTI tractography images demonstrate significant deviation of the corticospinal fibers and association fibers; however, apparently there is evidence of cortical spinal tracts adjacent to this mass lesion.
In comparison with the prior examinations, no significant changes are visualized in the left occipital mass with persistent vasogenic edema, slow diffusion and mass effect.
Pre-operative planning study with stable multiseptated, multiloculated peripherally enhancing lesion in left temporoparietal lobe with associated significant perilesional edema causing mass effect on the atrium and body of left lateral ventricle.
[**4-9**] CT head postop: Status post craniotomy and drainage of left parietal abscesses with small amount of post procedural intraparenchymal and extra-axial hemorrhage and unchanged vasogenic edema without evidence of significant mass effect.
[**4-10**] Chest Xray: There is an endotracheal tube whose distal tip is 5 cm above the carina at the level of the aortic knob and appropriately sited.
There is mild prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings without overt pulmonary edema.
No large pleural effusions or pneumothoraces are seen.
There is a right-sided PICC line whose distal tip is at the cavoatrial junction, unchanged from prior.
Post-surgical changes in the left parietal region, with heterogeneous enhancement in the left parietal lobe extend into the atrium of the left lateral ventricle with mild subependymal enhancement and moderate surrounding edema.
This is decreased since the pre-operative study, with a few persistent blood products and possible purulent material.
A faint focus of enhancement in the pons, likely represents a capillary telangiectasia and is unchanged.
[**4-14**] Transthoracic Echocardiogram The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 72 year old female with known left tempoparietal brain abscess who presented with increased headaches,nausea, vomiting, and agitation who presented on [**2184-4-7**] with more enhancing lesions (probable abcess) and cerebral edema.
The patient had a brain MRI with and without contrast to assess the extent ofthe multiple brain abscesses which was consistent with multiseptated, multiloculated peripherally enhancing lesion in left temporoparietal lobe is suggestive of an abscess with associated significant perilesional edema causing mass effect on the atrium and body of left lateral ventricle.
Enhancement along the atrium of left lateral ventricle which likely represents subependymal spread of infection.Changes of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
A functional MRI was performed as this lesion is near her motor and speech centers of her brain because she is right-handed and left hemisphere dominate which was consistent with limited examination due to patient motion, functional MRI sequences of the brain were cancelled due to lack of patient cooperation.
DTI tractography images demonstrate significant deviation of the corticospinal fibers and association fibers; however, apparently there is evidence of cortical spinal tracts adjacent to this mass lesion.
In comparison with the prior examinations, no significant changes are visualized in the left occipital mass with persistent vasogenic edema, slow diffusion and mass effect.
On [**4-8**],Infectious Disease was consulted and recommendations were as follows:The failure to resolve her brain abscess after a long course of metronidazole and ceftriaxone suggests that either her infection was polymicrobial at the outset or she developed a superinfection, perhaps via an organism introduced at the time of her prior surgery.
Based on the results of new brain aspiration, would adjust antibiotics accordingly, possibly to cover more resistant gram negative rods or to cover yeast or other atypical pathogens.
Postoperative head CT demonstrated no postoperative hemorrhage.
On [**4-14**], ID changed flagyl to PO 500mg Q8H which patient could not tolerate due to nausea so it was made IV once again.
She continued to have nausea around the administration of Flagyl and thus was managed with oral and IV antiemetics.
TTE was obtained on [**4-14**] which demonstrated a normal EF of 55% with no evidence of vegetations.
She remained neurologically stable during her hospital stay and at the time of discharge on [**4-15**] she was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating with an assistive device, afebrile with stable vital signs.
