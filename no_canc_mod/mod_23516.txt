No comparison studies available.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained with the use of oral and intravenous contrast.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Mild dependent atelectasis is present at the lung bases.
There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.
Multiple hypodense lesions are present throughout the liver, measuring up to 8 mm in diameter, too small for further characterization.
The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, and intra-abdominal loops of small bowel appear normal.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
No free air or free fluid is present.

No local fluid collections or abscesses are detected.
There is no free air or free fluid.
The prostate, seminal vesicles, and urinary bladder are unremarkable.
A focal filling defect within the right external iliac artery (2:81) is most compatible with a soft nonocclusive plaque, as there is no change in caliber of the vessel, and distal opacification with IV contrast is not compromised.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is no acute fracture or dislocation.
No concerning blastic or lytic lesions are detected.
Sigmoid diverticulitis, uncomplicated, with no neighboring fluid collections or free air.
Focal filling defect within the right external iliac artery, most compatible with a soft plaque which is nonocclusive.
