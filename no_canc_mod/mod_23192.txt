Multiple large filling defects are noted within the distal CBD consistent with stones.
Intrahepatic biliary system and gallbladder are not visualized on this study.
IMPRESSION: Massively dilated CBD with multiple filling defects consistent with the stones.
CT abdomen: Scans of the upper abdomen show mild intrahepatic bile duct dilatation and massive dilatation of the common bile duct.
The gallbladder is moderately distended, but shows no wall thickening nor any other signs of acute cholecystitis.
There are small stones within the gallbladder, the largest measuring 1.1 cm.
No tenderness was elicited during the scanning.
There is no ascites.
CONCLUSION: Choledocholithiasis with massive dilatation of the common duct, 2.8 cm common bile duct with stone and sludge within the common duct.
The gallbladder is dilated with smaller stones, but no son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of cholecystitis.
Escherichia coli septicemia -- MICU course as follows: Ms. [**Known lastname 65675**] refused central line placement.
Stent placement was successful, no purulent drainage was appreciated, but sphincterotomy was not performed because of hypoxia during the procedure.
Blood cultures grew E. coli resistant to floroquinolones.
A midline was placed, as the E. coli was not sensitive to any tested oral antibiotics, and she will required 10 additional days of IV ceftriaxone.
2. heart murmur -- Given bacteremia, and no previous documented heart murmur, I felt obligated to have an echocardiogram prior to discharge.
There was no evidence of vegetation, and only trivial mitral regurgitation to account for the murmur.
Notably, she did not have any positive blood cultures subsequent to the first.
3. hypertension -- initially held antihypertensives, but reinitiated prior to discharge.
COPD -- hypoxia during ERCP/MAC anesthesia, but stable upon presentation on the floor on two liters.
Outpatient Lab Work Complete blood count and complete metabolic panel next Friday, [**2193-8-9**]   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Nursing Home - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Escherichia coli sepsis cholecystitis/choledocolithiasis   Discharge Condition: stable, with midline intravenous access, afebrile.
Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized for E. coli septicemia and gallbladder stones.
Please call your physician or return to the hospital if you have any concerns or questions, particularly fever greater than 101, abdominal pain, mental status changes, nausea/vomiting, abdominal distension, or increasing shortness of breath.
