The pregnancy was notable for a prenatal echo showing premature patent ductus arteriosus closure and right ventricular hypertrophy and valvular regurgitation.
The pregnancy was also complicated by insulin dependent diabetes.
There was a nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing prompting a cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.
The infant emerged with spontaneous respirations.
General nondysmorphic, slightly preterm male in mild respiratory distress.
Nondysmorphic facies.
The initial respiratory distress resolved,     however, the infant continued to have hypoxemia requiring     oxygen, which was administered by [**Doctor Last Name **].
He had several episodes of desaturation     associate with crying, but these resolved by day of life     #2.
He has continued in room air and has had no episodes     of oxygen desaturation for 72 hours prior to discharge.
He maintained normal heart rates     and blood pressures.
Mild     right ventricular dysfunction, but otherwise normal.
At the time of discharge,     [**Location (un) 69296**] heart rates are 110 to 150 beats per minute     with no murmurs noted.
At the time of discharge he     is ad lib po feeding taking in a minimum of 140     milliliters per kilo per day of Similac 24 calorie per     ounce or breast milk fortified to 24 calories per ounce     with Similac powder.
Due to the unclear etiology of the     respiratory disease and unknown group beta strep status     of the mother, [**Name (NI) 50434**] was evaluated for sepsis upon     admission to the neonatal intensive care unit.
Feeding, ad lib po feeding or breast feeding.
No medications.
[**Location (un) 50434**] was     observed in his car seat for 90 minutes without any     episodes of bradycardia or oxygen desaturation.
State newborn screen was sent on [**2144-7-28**] with no     notification of abnormal results to date.
Synagis RSV prophylaxis should     be considered fro [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who     meet any of the following 3 criteria; first born at less     than 32 weeks; second, born between 32 and 35 weeks with     2 of the following; day care during RSV season, a smoker     in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway     abnormalities or school age siblings, or thirdly with     chronic lung disease.
Before this age and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out of home care givers.
Transitional respiratory distress.
Pulmonary hypertension with mild right ventricular     dysfunction.
Suspicion for sepsis ruled out.
