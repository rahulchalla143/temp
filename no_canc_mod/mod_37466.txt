The Let circumflex had a 99%stenosis in the proximal and mid portions.
The RCA had a 50% stenosis in the mid portion and a 80% stenosis distally.
Resting hemodynamic measurements revealed severe systemic arterial hypertension with a SBP ranging from 150-180 during nitroglycerine infusion.
There was a 50mm Hg gradient noted across a stenotic segment of the right iliac artery at the level of the aortic bifurcation.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a well-seated and functioning prosthetic mitral annular ring.
Left lower lobe alveolar opacity and less marked right lower lobe opacity slightly increased.
Bilateral pleural effusions mostly on the left are small and unchanged.
