Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities most noticably in the anterolateral leads.
Cannot rule out underlying myocardial ischemia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2149-2-18**] anterolateral ST-T wave changes persist.
Left occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage with extension into the extra-axial space.
Mild-to-moderate surrounding vasogenic edema and sulcal and left lateral ventricle effacement.
New but chronic-appeearing focus of encephalomalacia in the left anterior frontal lobe.
This variability may be due to periods of relative drowsiness and wakefulness, though clinical correlate through video review did not appreciably demonstrate a change in clinical state.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of occasional bursts of slowing seen involving the right posterior quadrant superimposed upon a slow background.
The former abnormality may represent a focal area of subcortical disturbance, while the slow background is more consistent with a larger, subcortical, deep midline abnormality.
No frank epileptiform activity was seen during this  recording, but if the patient has frequent symptoms, continuous EEG recording with event monitoring and spike and seizure detection algorithms may provide additional diagnostic information  Portable NCHCT: IMPRESSION: Intraparenchymal hemorrhage with small extraaxial component in the left occipital lobe is unchanged compared with prior exam, without significant mass effect.
[**2153-2-9**] NCHCT: IMPRESSION: Essentially unchanged left occipital lobe hemorrhage and small left subdural hemorrhage given differences in scan technique.
No significant interval change in size of the left occipital lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage with continued mass effect on the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle, unchanged.
Small subdural hematoma overlying the left parietal lobe is less conspicuous on the present study.
No new intracranial hemorrhage or infarction.
Little change in comparison to prior study from yesterday with no significant change in the interval size of the left occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage with continued mass effect on the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
Stable appearance of small subdural hematoma overlying the left parietal lobe.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 12067**] is a 70 year old right-handed female with a history of coronary artery disease, osteoporosis, asthma and right occipital hemorrhage ([**2149**]) from amyloid angiopathy who now presents with headache and vision loss.
Her neurological exam is significant for right homonymous hemianopia and spotty left peripheral field deficit.
She is also having some mild memory deficits and inability to perform DOW backwards both of which are reportedly new according to her family.
These are most likely due to her anxiousness and has improved prior to discharge.
Head CT shows a left occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Her right [**Year (4 digits) **] field deficits are consistent with the hemorrhage in the left occipital cortex.
The left peripheral field deficits are chronic deficits due to the prior right occipital hemorrhage in [**2149**].
The most likely etiology of her hemorrhage is from cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
NEURO: Amyloid angiopathy with new occipital hemorrhage - mannitol used initially for symptomatic improvement.
Starting Enlive and magic cup supplements - nutrition consult following - started remeron 15mg po qhs for appetite stimulus and further mood improvement .
6. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
7. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: [**1-22**] puff Inhalation q4hrs  as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: left occipital lobe hemorrhage amyloid angiopathy   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Mood is anxious and frequently tearful   Discharge Instructions: Dear Mrs. [**Known lastname 12067**], It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay.
You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of vision changes and confusion.
It was found that you had a bleed on the left side of your brain, in the area known as the occipital lobe, which process [**Known lastname **] information.
Understandably this is certainly causing a degree of anxiousness that would be expected.
To help you with this anxiousness and with your recovery we have started you on a medication, celexa 20mg by mouth daily.
The cause of the current bleed is the same as your previous, a disorder called amyloid angiopathy, which makes your brain arteries more likely to have these bleeds.
We have started you on a appetite stimuling medicine, remeron 15mg by mouth nightly, which will also likely help with your mood.
We would like you to have a repeat MRI of your brain vessels given that on your imaging there was an incidental finding of a small 3.5mm aneurysm.
