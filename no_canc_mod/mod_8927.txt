Admission Date:  [**2165-3-31**]       Discharge Date:  [**2165-4-25**]   Service:  TRAUMA  DIAGNOSIS:  Patient status post fall with a left subdural hematoma  BRIEF HISTORY:  The patient is a 79-year-old male with a past medical history of cerebrovascular accident who was on Coumadin who fell one day prior to arrival to the hospital and was seen in [**Hospital6 33**] initially with complaints of right rib pain and a scalp hematoma.
At the outside hospital, his chest x-ray revealed atelectasis of the right lower lobe and a CT scan of his head revealed a left side subdural hematoma.
He had a CT scan of his chest which showed a small hemopneumothorax on the right side.
On further history from the son, the patient tripped over a doorway threshold in the basement and had an unwitnessed fall with no acute changes in cognition or behavior.
Hypertension 2.
Hypercholesterolemia 3.
Dementia 4.
Status post cerebrovascular accident in [**2161**] with residual expressive aphasia  ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 1.
NECK:  Nontender with no stepoff.
BACK:  Nontender with no step-off or deformities.
His chest x-ray revealed a hemopneumothorax on the right side.
Head CT significant for 9 mm left subdural hematoma with no shift.
He had a chest tube placed on the right side, received Dilantin and had neurologic checks.
The patient had a prolonged Intensive Care Unit course which was complicated by flash pulmonary edema, as well as a non Q-wave myocardial infarction.
The patient also required intubation for this episode of pulmonary edema.
Once his sedation was weaned, he had minimal movement of his right upper and lower extremity.
Neurosurgery service recommended obtaining an MRI to rule out an infarct, as well as an MRI of C-spine to clear for ligamentous injury.
His MRI revealed no change in the size of the subdural hematoma, but he did have a left sided caudate infarct.
He was awake and attentive and was following commands and had purposeful movements of his left upper and lower extremities, but he would only withdraw his right upper and lower extremity to painful stimuli.
He subsequently had an increased production of sputum and sputum cultures were positive for Citrobacter for which he was started on levofloxacin.
Subsequently, his course was complicated by further fever spikes and he once again grew out Citrobacter from his sputum and his antibiotics were tailored and he was started on ceftazidime, responded to that well with no subsequent fever spikes and he will receive a 10 day course of ceftazidime.
Vancomycin was added for gram positive cocci in his sputum which he cleared on subsequent sputum samples.
He tolerated full strength tube feeds via his percutaneous gastrostomy tubes and supportive management was continued with a slow wean from the ventilator.
He tolerated short trach mask trial.
Cardiology service was following the patient and recommended the use of beta blockers to control his heart rate, as well as ACE inhibitors for afterload reduction.
Because of the patient's persistent tachycardia, which could not be explained, a CT angio was obtained to rule out pulmonary embolism which was negative.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Left subdural hemorrhage after a fall, on Coumadin, as well as a cerebrovascular accident with right sided hemiparesis, as well as right hemothorax.
