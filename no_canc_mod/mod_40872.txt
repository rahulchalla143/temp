History of Present Illness: The patient is a 65 year old right handed man with a past medical history significant for a.fib (not on Coumadin - has been undergoing cardioversion and ablations, and has been off for at least a month, HTN, HLD, DM - on insulin and oral medications, who presents with a sudden onset of right sided weakness, determined to have a LMCA syndrome at an OSH, given tPA and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
Here on examination he continued to have severe deficits, given a stroke scale of 23.
He had a CTA which showed a persistent L MCA clot and he was taken to the angio suite for intervention.
Past Medical History: - afib: only on ASA not on Coumadin (been off for at least a month) - HTN - DM on insulin - HLD - CAD had a stent at least 1 year ago - s/p cholecystectomy 1 year prior   Social History: Lives with his wife.
General: Awake and alert, attending to name, but not following commands HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs clear anteriorly Cardiac: RRR, s1s2, no murmurs heard Abdomen: soft, NT/ND Extremities: normal no c/c/e .
Followed eye opening and closing commands, and one hand squeeze commands, otherwise no others.
Right arm - minimal effort against gravity, slight withdrawal to pain (flexor), no movement in hand, leg slight withdrawal to pain no effort against gravity.
Peaked P wave in lead V1.
Tall R wave in lead V1 suggests right ventricular pressure overload.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
CTA NECK AND HEAD W&W/OC & RECONS [**2163-9-30**]: Large left MCA territory infarction with ischemia involving the entire left MCA territory.
Abrupt occlusion at the distal left M1 segment.
The appearance on the perfusion map with increased MTT and reduced blood volume suggest irreversible injury.
No hemorrhage.
TRANS CATH INFUSION [**2163-9-30**]: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 90711**] underwent cerebral angiography and mechanical and chemical thrombolysis of the left middle cerebral artery and its branches which were successful.
Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
No pleural effusion.
No focal consolidation, no pneumothorax.
EEG [**2163-10-3**]: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Continuous EEG recording showed a mildly slow background at best but with close to normal frequencies posteriorly on the right.
There were no epileptiform features or electrographic seizures.
The very suppressed background on the left suggests either widespread cortical dysfunction (e.g.
with a stroke) or material interposed between the brain and recording electrodes (e.g.
There was no evidence for ongoing seizures.
ECHO [**2163-10-4**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Agitated saline contrast study at rest revealed no evidence of intracardiac shunt (though technically suboptimal).
No intracardiac mass/thrombus identified.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2163-10-4**]: There has been no appreciable change.
Again seen is a large recent infarct within the left MCA territory, with confluent hemorrhagic conversion in the left lentiform nucleus and corona radiata, as well as gyriform cortical hemorrhages.
There is unchanged blood in the frontal and occipital horns of the left lateral ventricle, and in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
There is unchanged rightward shift of the normally midline structures, and effacement of the left lateral and third ventricles, but no dilatation of the right lateral ventricle.
His symptoms included aphasia and right sided hemiparesis.
"Large left MCA territory infarction with ischemia involving the entire left  MCA territory and abrupt occlusion at the distal left M1 segment.
The appearance on the perfusion map with increased MTT and reduced blood volume suggest irreversible injury.
No hemorrhage."
His last CT scan on [**2163-10-4**] showed the presence of a large volume MCA stroke with hemorrhagic conversion as well as intraventricular hemorrhage.
The CT on [**2163-10-4**] did not show any signs of local vasogenic edema concerning enough to start on osmotic therapy.
His persistent neurological symptoms include significant right hemiparesis, difficulty following commands, right sided hyper-reflexia, and weak withdrawal to noxious stimuli on the right side.
He subsequently required a tracheostomy because of an inability tolerate secretions and impaired swallow/gag function.
During his ICU stay, he developed intermittent fevers and leukocytosis.
CXR revealed right pleural effusions and lower lobe opacity consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
As patient was transferred from ICU to general floor, he was placed on a VAP antibiotic bundle (vancomycin, tobramycin, cefepime) which helped reduce his fevers and leukocytosis and resulted in clearing of the CXR over the course of 3 days.
At that time, an attempt at placing a PMV failed because of significant secretions.
During the first two to three days of ICU stay, he developed a rapid ventricular rate required a bolus of amiodarone over the course of 24 hours.
He continued to have low fevers during the first days of treatment, however all cultures, including blood, urine, and sputum/BAL were negative.
His blood sugar control has been complicated during this hospital admission with blood glucose values ranging from 150-300.
All his lipid modifying agents were held out of concern for worsening hemorrhagic process.
The patient did not suffer from belly tenderness of peritoneal signs following the noticed pneumoperitoneum, and it has since resolved on repeat x-rays.
*) TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES: Mr. [**Known lastname 90711**] suffered a severe stroke to his left brain and his course has been complicated.
Of note, he developed aspiration pneumonia while in the hospital, requiring his placement on an antibiotic regiment.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: primary: left middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion.
You have symptoms of right sided weakness and difficulty in speech.
Some of these symptoms may improve with time and appropriate rehabilitation.
