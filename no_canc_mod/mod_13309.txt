Return to the operating room for control of bleeding  History of Present Illness: :85F with significant CAD and s/p CABG in [**2148**] hx of diastolic heart failure presents from OSH for cardiac catheterization for planned stenting of LM to LCx.
During procedure patient recieved 7000U hep bolus and had a 6F Arterial sheath and 5 french venous sheath.
These issues prompted a CT scan which revealed a large left-sided RP hematoma.

Post cath patient had a vagal episode during venous sheath removal.
She had a noncontrast CT after 2 units that showed the beginnings of a retroperitoneal hematoma.
Her groin had no hematoma so my thought was that the only place to sequester that many transfused units was in the retroperitoneum.
There was no external iliac artery injury and no arterial bleeding coming from under the inguinal ligament.
We controlled some minor venous bleeding points and closed with the supposition that based on now stable hemodynamics, Hct of >35 that there was no ongoing source and that the 2nd Hct was likely in error.
Large retorperitoneal hematoma encountered this time with bleeding coming from under inguinal ligament (still no groin hematoma).
Groin was opened and small arterial puncture site just under the lower edge of the inguinal ligament (no sign of Mynx closure device) was repaired with single prolene stitch.
No further bleeding.
Oliguria / ATN renal failure attributed to recent dye load and shock.
CT showed bilateral pneumonias as only potiential source for infection.
Patient had persistant thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology.
Final event was rapid Afib (previously rate controlled), hypotension that ensued quickly degraded to non-cardiovertable asystole.
