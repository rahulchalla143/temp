HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77 year old white female with a history of atrial fibrillation, St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] aortic valve replacement, on Coumadin, who presented with one to two weeks of progressive left lower quadrant pain.
The pain was described as continuous, with intermittent periods of worsening.
Four days prior to admission, she noted a bloody bowel movement.
On the day prior to admission, she had bright red blood per rectum times one.
She reports one episode of emesis two days prior to admission, which was non-bilious and non-bloody.
She has been on Coumadin for her atrial fibrillation and aortic valve replacement.
She received four units of fresh frozen plasma and a head CT scan was performed, which was read as negative for an acute intracranial hemorrhage.
An abdominal CT scan was performed which revealed diverticula and a thickened proximal sigmoid and descending colon within significant stranding and calcified vascular structures.
On physical examination, the patient had moderate left lower quadrant tenderness without rebound or guarding.
Her rectal examination revealed maroon guaiac positive stool.
She was afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
History of diverticula in the sigmoid colon on a colonoscopy in [**2144-7-2**].
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Chronic atrial fibrillation.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure, no echocardiogram available.
Status post partial thyroidectomy.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers or chills.
She complains of slight nausea, left lower quadrant and bright red blood per rectum, as above, no lightheadedness, headache, dysuria, recent emesis or recent antibiotic use.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements intact, oropharynx clear, dry mucous membranes, anicteric sclerae.
Neck:  Supple, no jugular venous pressure.
Cardiovascular: Irregularly irregular, mechanical S2, I/VI systolic murmur at left lower sternal border.
Abdomen:  Bowel sounds present, moderate tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant with no diffuse rebound or guarding, nondistended.
Rectal: Maroon guaiac positive stool in Emergency Room, no masses.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Admission head CT negative was negative for intracranial or extracranial hemorrhage.
Admission CT of abdomen and pelvis revealed significant bowel wall thickening, stranding and pericolic fluid at the level of the left distal descending and proximal sigmoid colon, diverticula and vascular calcifications present; differential diagnosis diverticulitis versus ischemic bowel and/or hemorrhage into the bowel wall; there were also large gallstones present without evidence of cholecystitis.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient was admitted to the medical team and was followed by the gastroenterology service and the surgical service given her lower gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of supratherapeutic INR.
Given the constellation of an elevated white blood cell count with a left shift, the appearance of the CT scan, and her left lower quadrant pain, the most likely diagnosis was diverticulitis with an intramural bleed.
She was started on intravenous ciprofloxacin and Flagyl as well as intravenous vancomycin for Enterococcus coverage, given her penicillin allergy.
She received two units of packed red blood cells as well as two additional units of fresh frozen plasma for an elevated INR.
Her diet was advanced to clears and she was changed over to oral antibiotics of ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day and Flagyl 500 mg three times a day to complete a total of five days of oral antibiotics for presumptive diverticulitis.
She continued to have trace guaiac positive stools, however, she had no gross bloody bowel movements.
Her left lower quadrant pain resolved and she had no further emesis.
Cardiovascular:  The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] aortic valve replacement, for which she was on Coumadin with a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.5.
The cardiology service was consulted in regard to whether she should be continued on anticoagulation given the high risk of stroke and with her mechanical valve.
The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and hypertension.
On admission, her cardiac medications were held in the setting of her acute bleed.
She did have several episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, however, she remained hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic.
Pulmonary:  The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
She received additional Lasix while in the Intensive Care Unit for some mild pulmonary edema after receiving multiple units of fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood cells.
