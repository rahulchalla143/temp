The right ICA is not opacified through the petrous segment, but this may reflect decreased flow due to the distal thrombus rather than thrombosis of this segment of the vessel as there is no hyperdense thrombus visualized in this segment of the artery.
Corresponding decreased cerebral blood flow and blood volume in the right middle cerebral artery distribution.
There is distal collateral flow.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
HEAD AND NECK MRI [**9-6**] FINDINGS:  There is slow diffusion within the entire right middle cerebral artery territory, compatible with acute/subacute ischemia.
Hyperintense signal is seen within the right internal carotid artery extending from the distal cervical portion through the bifurcation and also in the middle cerebral artery on the right, which may reflect combination of slow flow and/or thrombus.
There is no hemorrhage.
Elsewhere, there is confluent and punctate FLAIR signal hyperintensity in periventricular and subcortical white matter bilaterally, which likely reflect sequela of moderate microvascular disease.
Acute infarct involving nearly the entire right middle cerebral artery territory.
Thrombus and/or slow flow within the right internal carotid artery extending from the distal cervical portion through the bifurcation of the internal carotid artery and into the right middle cerebral artery.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
No ASD or PFO by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction.
No LV mass/thrombus.
Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Mild (1+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:           N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is severe global and regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis to dyskinesis of the basal to mid inferior wall and apex, and global hypokinesis in the remaining segments (EF 15-20%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
No PFO or ASD by resting saline injection.
Severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
There is cytotoxic edema in essentially the entire territory of the right middle cerebral artery, representing evolution of the known thromboembolic infarction.
There is no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.
There is no uncal herniation and no cerebellar tonsillar herniation.
There is persistent hyperdensity in the distal right internal carotid artery and proximal right middle cerebral artery, corresponding to the known embolus.
Calcifications are again noted in bilateral intracranial vertebral arteries, as well as cavernous and supraclinoid portions of bilateral internal carotid arteries.
Hypodensities are again noted in the white matter of the left cerebral hemisphere, likely corresponding to sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Continued expected evolution of the acute infarction in the right middle cerebral artery territory, with only mild mass effect at this time.
No hemorrhagic transformation.
Persistent embolic occlusion of the distal right internal carotid artery and proximal right middle cerebral artery.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
Brief Hospital Course: The pt is a 76 yo M with history of pAfib on Coumadin, off Coumadin for 5 days as he was planned to undergo cardiac catheterization because of recent worsening of his cardiac function and CHF (EF 10-15%) who was transported to the hospital after his wife found him lethargic, non-communicative and with left side weakness.
He was found on CTA and CT perfusion to have thromboembolic occlusion of [**Country **]-RMCA c/b ischemia in the RMCA distribution.
His limited neurological exam demonstrated R hemiparesis (arm>leg), left sided neglect and forced eye deviation towards the right.
Ischemic stroke: An MRI was performed and confirmed acute infarct in the entire right MCA territory and large thrombus in the right carotid extending from the distal cervical portion, through the bifurcation of the internal carotid and into the right MCA.
On [**9-12**], pt was found to have a cold, mottled, pulseless left leg.
Found to have aortoiliac thrombus.
If no surgery, would progress to ischemic necrosis of the leg and sepsis.
On [**9-12**], continued to be tachpneic, with worsening CXR infiltrates and new leukocytosis, was started on antibiotic therapy for HAP.
