Admission Date:  [**2184-3-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-3-18**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**] Chief Complaint: Transferred to cath   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Coronary angioplasty Bare metal stent to LAD   History of Present Illness: 88 year old female with PMH of HTN, colon cancer s/p resection, presents from OSH for cardiac catheterization.
Patient states she has been having left back/scapular pain intermittently for over 2 years.
She describes this pain as an ache that feels muscular.
It worsens with movement but also comes on with exertion after walking for a block or two.
She denies SOB, palpitations, N/V, chest pain, or radiating pain to neck or left arm.
Per note from NEBH, patient had inferolateral ischemia on ETT (4minutes) with reproduction of symptoms.
Because of these changes she was sent for cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital6 **] which showed 90% stenosis to the LAD and she is being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for intervention with cath in the AM.
She had no other complaints.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Colon Ca [**2170**] s/p resection Tonsillectomy at age 9 B/L Hip replacements  Cardiac Risk Factors: - Diabetes, - Dyslipidemia,  + Hypertension   Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use.
Family History: Mother with MI, Father with Prostate Ca and MI.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
Irregular rhythm Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
ETT performed on [**2-/2184**] demonstrated inferolateral ischemia on ETT (4minutes) with reproduction of symptoms.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is an 88 year old female with PMH of HTN, colon cancer s/p resection, presents from NEBH s/p cardiac catheterization which demonstrated 90% stenosis of [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization and intervention of LAD.
CAD - Patient has no prior history of CAD.
She describes intermittent left scapular/back pain which has been ongoing for 2 years.
Stress test done 2-3 weeks ago showed inferolateral ischemia with reproduction of symptoms.
Patient experienced hypotensive episode after femoral sheath was pulled, and she developed a large groin hematoma and transiently lost lower extremity pulses, for details see below.
# Groin hematoma: As above, catheterization complicated by groin bleed with estimated blood loss of approximately 1 liter.
Serial hematocrits were obtained and no further drops were observed.
# Possible limb ischemia: loss of DP pulse most likely secondary to holding pressure on femoral artery.
# Delerium: Likely in the setting of receieving sedation for catheterization.
Hypertension: Regimen adjusted secondary to hypotension post procedure.
Colon Ca - Patient is s/p resection, no history of recurrence.
FEN - Cardiac heart healthy diet, replete lytes .
Coronary artery disease Secondary 1.
Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile, ambulatory   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for a cardiac catheterization and received a stent to one of your arteries.
If you develop any chest pain, shortness of breath, pain in your groin or back, bleeding from your procedure site or any other concerning symptoms, you should call your doctor or come to the emergency room.
