Past Medical History: Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, Coronary Artery Disease (s/p MI/stent-RCA '[**13**]), [**2083**] s/p tx Hodgkin's @19yo, s/p chemotherapy and mantle radiation, Cardiomyopathy, Arthritis  Social History: cares for disabled husband denies etoh no tobacco  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: NAD HR 91 RR 12 BP 111/91 Lungs CTAB Heart RRR 2/6 systolic murmur Abdomen Benign Extrem Trace LE edema Superficial and anterior varicosities Carotids with transmitted murmur and bruit  Pertinent Results: [**2120-12-26**] CXR: 1) Gradual resolution of the left retrocardiac air space disease.
[**2120-12-23**] Echo: PRE CPB The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No spontaneous  [**Doctor Last Name **] contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal dyskinesis and severe apical and distal anterior wall hypokinesis There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis as well (LVEF = 25 %).
There is focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right ventricle.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is mild right ventricular global hypokinesis with improved apical function.
The left ventricle continues to show septal dyskinesis and distal anterior apical severe hypokinesis.
Initially after separation from bypass, a jet of moderate aortic regurgitation emanating from the bileaflet prosthesis in the region of the native valve right and left commisure was seen.
There was still mild to moderate valvular aortic regurgitation though.
Although the regurgitation appeared valvular, suboptimal image quality prevented complete exclusion of a perivalvualr source.
There was trace mitral regurgitation.
A tricuspid annuloplasty ring is also seen.
There is mild tricuspid regurgitation with a maximum gradient of 7 mm Hg across the valve.
