Head CT, Abd CT (-); CT C-spine showed no signs of acute injury.
Intubated for airway protection given altered mental status and combatitiveness.
The MICU stay was complicated by RLL/RML aspiration pna which grew MRSA in the sputum and BAL, s/p levo/clinda/vanc, [**Date range (1) 109654**].
Unasyn x 2 days was given for sinusitis noted on CT scan performed [**12-26**] persistent fever ([**Date range (1) 87437**]).
Abd imaging without any collections or source of fevers.
Head MR performed to r/o hypothalmic lesion.
Repeat LP performed w/o evidence of meningitis.
No recent foreign travel or camping.
Tagged WBC Scan [**6-20**]: No abnormal foci of tracer uptake identified.
Since this has a segmental distribution, streptococcal, Legionella and Klebsiella pneumonia remain in the differential diagnosis.
Multiple mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with hepatosplenomegaly.
Chest CT [**6-7**] RUL and RLL infiltrate c/w pneumonia .
TTE [**2182-6-13**]: EF 60%, no LVH.
CT chest [**6-14**] mutliple axillary and mediastinal lymph nodes.
interval decrease in RLL consolidation .
ABD CT [**6-14**] no intra-abdominal collections .
TEE Echo [**6-17**]: no vegatations noted.
There is a dense area of consolidation within the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.
There is no pleural effusion or CHF.
IMPRESSION: Pneumonia in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.
[**2182-6-27**]: PICC Line placement: IMPRESSION: Successful placement of 43 cm total length right brachial PICC with tip in the superior vena cava.
Brief Hospital Course: A: 42 yoM w/ HIV presents s/p fall following lorazepam/depakote OD .
CXR [**6-3**] and on chest CT on [**6-6**] revealed right upper and lower lobe consolidation c/w  pneumonia.
Chest CT [**6-7**] showed RUL/RLL pna which grew MRSA in the sputum and BAL, s/p levo/clinda/vanc, [**Date range (1) 109654**].
On [**6-19**], a repeat cxr noted RUL cavitary lesion and patient underwent CT scan for further evaluation.
Vancomycin was dosed more aggressively with goal troughs of 15, and the patient defervesced within 48 hours and remained afebrile throughout the remainder of his ICU admission.
CT surgery was consulted and felt the lesion was not amenable to either perc drainage or surgical intevention.
2) DVT- patient noted to have unilateral RLE edema on [**6-22**].
4) Hyperdynamic episodes: These were felt to most likely be due to alcohol withdrawal, though the differential include acute intracranial process vs. non-convulsive status.
EEG in MICU showed mild encephalopathy with no focal epileptiform activity.
Physical exam notable for ocular hippus, muscle rigidity during acute hyperdynamic episodes.
The pt was treated with MVI, thiamine, folate for possible alcohol related mental status changes.
Repeat CT revealing some resolution of ethmoid sinus opacities and alternative fever source negated plans for possible operative intervention.
Started on zyprexa and haldol prn following episode of agitation on [**6-25**] during which he pulled out his PICC line.
8) Full Code  Dispo - Patient was stable and afebrile on the day of discharge and will need to continue 5 week course of antibiotics as well as Coumadin for DVT treatment.
Nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO four times a day as needed for thrush.
