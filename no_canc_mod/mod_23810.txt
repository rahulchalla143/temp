Admission Date:  [**2190-10-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2190-10-14**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**] Chief Complaint: fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**10-7**]:  Left femoral neck fracture status post percutaneous fixation with 7.3 mm screws of nondisplaced valgus impacted femoral neck fracture.
History of Present Illness: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a past medical history of CVA on coumadin and seizure disorder presenting from OSH for recent diagnosis of left non-displaced femoral neck fracture with hypoxemia and moderately sized right sided pleural effusions.
She had no presyncopal symptoms, no fevers, no chest pain or shortness of breath surrounding the event; no loss of consciousness.
Other than pain, she had no significant other symptoms.
Pelvic imaging revealed a left femoral neck fracture, non-displaced.
CT chest revealed a moderately sized left sided and small right sided pleural effusions.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management when these effusions were detected.
In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], radiology reviewed these films and felt they were consistent with pleural effusions not hemothorax.
She did have hypoxemia with O2 sats in the high 80s; she was placed on a non-rebreather with improvement to the high 90s.
She did not endorse significant dyspnea or chest pain.
She received ceftriaxone and azithromycin given her pleural effusions and fentanyl for her hip pain.
Her health care proxy, her son [**Name (NI) **], declined consent for any surgery and he stated he would reconsider in the morning after discussing her status with the attending.
At time of transfer to the MICU, she was in mild hip pain but with no other complaints.
She has good exercise tolerance frequently climbing her [**7-8**] stairs to get to the [**Location (un) 1773**] of her house without significant dyspnea or fatigue.
CVA X 2 (unclear what type) dating back a couple of decades 3. hypertension 4. hyperlipidemia 5. paroxysmal afib   Social History: Lives at home by herself in [**Location (un) 14840**], MA; her son, [**Name (NI) **], who lives at [**Location (un) **] visits her frequently and helps with groceries, maintenance of house, otherwise she does most of her ADLs and is very active at home.
Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS BP 129/67, HR 74, afebrile, SpO2 98% on 4 L NC Gen: Sitting up in bed in NAD Neuro: Alert, cannot tell us year and identifies hospital as "[**Location (un) **]," however she is able to give us a detailed history of her fall and converses brightly and intelligently.
Cardiac: Systolic ejection murmur loudest at left lower sternal border grade III/VI Pulm: moderate dullness to percussion over left lung base, mildly diminished breath sounds at left and right lung base, exam somewhat limited by inability to sit up secondary to hip pain Abd: very soft and nontender, normoactive bowel sounds Ext: Limited secondary to hip pain, no edema noted   Pertinent Results: I. Labs  A.
Video Swallow ([**2190-10-13**]) INDICATION: Coughing with meals, dysphagia, history of esophageal dilatation.
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: The study was conducted in collaboration with speech pathology.
There is no aspiration into the airway.
There is a small amount of nasal regurgitation with thin consistency.
There is a small amount of residue with nectar consistency.
There is a moderate amount of residue with puree consistency.
B. CXR ([**2190-10-12**]) HISTORY: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with respiratory difficulty and altered mental status.
SINGLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST AT 9:15 A.M.: There has been an increase in size of a layering right pleural effusion, now moderate, and development of a new left pleural effusion, small.

There is good aeration of the upper lungs, without consolidation or pneumothorax.
There is no new hilar or mediastinal enlargement.
Aortic arch calcifications are noted.
Degenerative changes are present in the spine.
A surgical clip at the thoracic inlet is compatible with prior thyroid surgery.
IMPRESSION:  Increased pleural effusions (moderate on the right and small on the left), in combination with improved aeration of the upper lungs is compatible with improving pulmonary edema.
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with history of CVA with left non-displaced femoral head fracture, has hypoxia and right-sided pleural effusion, for further evaluation to exclude intracranial abnormality.
FINDINGS: Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct.
There is a chronic infarct identified in the left occipital region with encephalomalacia and ex vacuo dilatation of the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
There are diffuse hyperintensities in the white matter indicative of small vessel disease.
Moderate-to-severe brain atrophy and medial temporal atrophy is also seen.

D. Hip nailing ([**2190-10-8**])STUDY: LEFT HIP INTRAOPERATIVE STUDY, [**2190-10-8**].
CLINICAL HISTORY: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with left hip fracture.
FINDINGS: Two views of the left hip from the operating room demonstrates interval placement of cannulated screws fixating a femoral neck fracture in the left side.
There are no signs for hardware-related complications.
COMPARISON: No prior study available for comparison.
FINDINGS: Within limits of motion artifact, there is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, major vascular territory infarction, mass effect or edema.
Hypodensity in the left occipital region may represent an area of encephalomalacia related to prior infarct.
Periventricular white matter hypodensity is consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Age-appropriate prominence of ventricles and sulci is compatible with diffuse parenchymal volume loss.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and left mastoid air cells are well aerated.
No osseous abnormality is identified.
There is calcification of the bilateral cavernous carotid arteries.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
Findings compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic disease and age-related involutional change.
Hypodensity in the left occipital region may represent an area of encephalomalacia related to prior infarct.
Underpneumatization and partial opacification of some of the right mastoid air cells.
COMPARISON: No prior study available for comparison.
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Large right and moderate left pleural effusions with associated atelectasis demonstrate simple fluid attenuation, and are better evaluated on chest CT performed at the outside hospital earlier the same day.
There is atherosclerotic calcification of the coronary arteries, but the heart is otherwise unremarkable.
There is a small-to-moderate hiatal hernia.
Focal calcification in the left pleural space may be related to pleural or diaphragmatic calcifications.
There is a wedge-shaped hyperenhancing perfusion abnormality in the right lobe of the liver (segment 8).
The left adrenal gland is slightly full.
The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
There are multiple hypodensities in the bilateral kidneys, most of which are too small to characterize, but likely simple cysts.
The largest hypodensity is in the interpolar region of the right kidney measuring 2.2 x 2.2 cm and with low attenuation, compatible with a simple cyst.
There is no free air or fluid in the abdomen.
No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy meeting CT criteria for pathologic enlargement is noted.
The aorta is of normal caliber throughout, but with marked atherosclerotic calcification and likely stenoses involving the origins of the celiac axis, SMA, [**Female First Name (un) 899**] and bilateral renal arteries.
There is a 2.4 x 2.4 cm cystic structure in the right adnexa.
There is mild sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
BONE WINDOWS: There is an ill-defined lucency through the left proximal femoral neck, best seen on the sagittal images (301B:46) compatible with acute fracture.
In addition, there is a lucency in the left ischium, which could also represent an acute fracture (2:70).
There is no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion identified.
There is multilevel degenerative change of the thoracolumbar spine with endplate osteophyte formation, loss of disc height and vacuum disc phenomenon at multiple levels.
