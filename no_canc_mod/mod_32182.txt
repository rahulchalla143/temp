Admission Date:  [**2144-6-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2144-6-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-2-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**] Chief Complaint: hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: RIJ placement [**6-23**]  History of Present Illness: 63 YO M w bipolar disorder, HTN, IDDM2, LE ulcers, CHF (EF = 20%) and prior CVA presenting from his PCPs office after being section 12'd in the setting of hypotension.
The patient is a very poor historian but reports that he has had shortness of breath productive of thick sputum over the past 3-4 days.
He has also had substernal chest pressure associated with diaphresis although without radiation.
He is unable to characterize further or describe in what setting this chest discomfort occurs.
He also endorses poor PO intake but denies fevers, chills, nightsweats.
He reports that his friend is dying of HCV and lung cancer and he is inside of him.
The patient does also endorse increased LE pain.
Exam was notable for a cantancerous male with left sided crackles and LE ulcers.
After fluid bolus the patient become sob w ABG 7.34/50/177 and was placed on CPAP with reported improvement.
Fast exam showed free fluid so a CT A/P was done.
This showed likely cirrhosis, ascites and ARF.
An EKG was done and showed a RBBB reportedly unchanged from prior.
Past Medical History: IDDM2 prior CVA HTN bipolar disorder AFib on coumadin CAD w CABG *4 in [**2130**], MI in his 40s PVD CHF w EF 25-30%, moderate to severe pulmonary HTN on TTE in [**12-9**] tremor diabetic neuropathy with resultant transmetatarsal amputation of the left foot [**2-4**] osteomyelitis and right foot ulcer tobacco abuse  Social History: The patient reports smoking an unknown quantity of tobacco since he was 22 years old.
He reports that he is a recovering alcoholic and does not do any recreational drugs.

Cirrhosis and splenomegaly.
Mild simple ascites and marked body wall edema.
4-cm infrarenal AAA.
Bilateral adrenal fullness, likely reactive hyperplasia.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
TTE:The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with near akinesis of the inferior wall and mild dyskinesis of the aneurysmal apex (LVEF = 25 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of mitral regurgitation.]
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size is mildly increased with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Biventricular cavity enlargement with global and regional systolic dysfunction c/w diffuse process (multivessel CAD, toxin, metabolic, etc.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Dilated ascending aorta.
Mild cardiomegaly is present.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly.
Partially distended gallbladder with wall thickening.
This is likely reactive, given absence of symptoms is less worrisome for acute cholecystitis.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 YO M w bipolar disorder, HTN, IDDM2, LE ulcers, CHF (EF = 20%) and prior CVA presenting from his PCP's office with hypotension, recent cough/SOB and chest pressure as well as increased LE ulcer pain.
The etiology of his initial hypotension was unclear, however it improved with diuresis, suggesting possible cardiogenic shock.
Per review of clinic notes, he also has history of low SBP 80s-90s at baseline so likely was not too far from baseline and had low reserve.
It was also possible that he took more of his home antihypertensives given his confusion and delirium with mania on initial presentation.
Per outpatient records, patient is on coumadin for Afib ([**Country **] score of 2 for DM and CHF)  .
The patient may have had bronchitis although unlikely to have pna with a clear xray and lack of need for oxygen aside from in the setting of what sounds like acute pulmonary edema after receiving a fluid bolus.
He was started on levofloxacin/ceftriaxone for presumed CAP; changed levofloxacin from IV to po [**6-25**]; after which he remained afebrile and WBC normalized with no sx of PNA.
# Chest discomfort in the setting of known CAD.
Right bundle-branch block.
Prior inferior myocardial infarction.
HIT antibodies pending.
Vancomycin given in ICU admission due to concern for cellulitis (pt had leukocytosis on admission).
Exam demonstrates skin changes consistent with chronic changes secondary to stasis and volume overload.
# Ascites CT, asterixis in exam, elevated INR, low albumin.
Likely pre-renal physiology vs CKD in the setting of DM.
Per CT [**6-23**],  Delayed bilateral renal contrast excretion; Recommend close monitoring of renal function as contrast induced nephropathy is a concern.
# Delusions/paranoia: Patient with known bipolar disorder.

You had ulcers in your legs and cellulitis.
You had shortness of breath which was treated with antibiotics and nebulizer breathing treatments.
START Coumadin 5 mg ONCE a day  Followup Instructions: Please have your blood drawn by Wednesday [**7-1**] to have your INR and kidney function monitored.
