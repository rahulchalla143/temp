Admission Date:  [**2194-3-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2194-4-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2142-2-10**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Hospital1 212**] INTERNAL MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 35246**] is a 57-year-old man with a complicated past medical history including cerebrovascular accident, seizure disorder, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and recurrent aspiration pneumonia who was discharged from [**Hospital6 649**] on [**3-24**] with aspiration pneumonia.
He was at his nursing home where he desaturated to 70% on 5 liters nasal cannula and became tachypneic and uncomfortable.
His most recent hospital course was significant for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia diagnosed on BAL washings.
He also had a video swallowing study which showed a high risk of aspiration, however at that time the patient elected to take continued po intake with thickened liquids.
History of seizure disorder 3.
Borderline diabetes mellitus 4.
Coronary artery disease 5.
Depression 6.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%.
Hypertension 8.
Hypothyroidism 9.
Bilateral hip fractures.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, status post cardioversion in [**2193-7-21**] 11.
Recurrent aspiration pneumonia  ADMISSION MEDICATIONS: 1.
GENERAL:  The patient was a middle aged man in mild respiratory distress.
NECK:  Supple with no lymphadenopathy or jugular venous distention.
CHEST:  Notable for rancorous breath sounds with no wheezes.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Irregularly irregular rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 and a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.
ABDOMEN:  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with hypoactive bowel sounds and no hepatosplenomegaly.
EXTREMITIES:  The patient had palpable peripheral pulses with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
NEUROLOGIC:  The patient was somnolent, but arousable and not cooperative with neurologic exam.
INITIAL LABORATORY STUDIES:  Chest x-ray indicated near complete opacification of the left hemithorax with a small portion of minimally aerated lungs seen laterally at the apex with progression of left upper lobe air space opacification since the prior study.
There is also diffuse increased density of the right hemithorax with apical capping most likely representing a layering pleural effusion on the right.
Phosphate was elevated at 4.6.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit within hours of his admission secondary to worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress.
A chest CT indicated severe tracheomalacia involving the carina and origin of the main stem bronchus bilaterally.
Bilateral pleural effusions which were increased since the last study were also noted, as well as widespread atelectasis in the right lower lobe, right middle lobe, lingula and left lower lobe.
There were scattered ground glass opacities and enlarged pulmonary arteries.
His hypertension was thought to be most likely related to his circulating volume.
He was also evaluated by the cardiac electrophysiology service for an episode of asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia as well as for the question of whether the patient would benefit from cardioversion given his atrial fibrillation and hypotension.
RENAL:  The patient remained stable from a renal perspective with his creatinine in the range of 1.1 to 1.4.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was continued on vancomycin and Flagyl for treatment of his aspiration pneumonia.
Sputum cultures were sent and grew out only oropharyngeal flora and sparse gram negative rods.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient remained coagulopathic initially with an INR of 4.8.
He was corrected to a value of 2.6 with vitamin K.  His coagulopathy was thought likely secondary to his decreased nutrition.
However, on repeat testing with a cosyntropin stimulation test, the patient ruled out for adrenal insufficiency.
The patient's pain control was adequately treated subsequently with a fentanyl patch and Dilaudid prn for breakthrough pain.
DERMATOLOGY:  Plastic surgery service was consulted and debrided a left elbow pressure ulcer.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications.

History of bilateral hip fractures  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.
Morphine sulfate 1 mg intravenous q4h prn pain 4.
Dulcolax 10 mg pr prn constipation 8.
Nystatin powder prn groin rash 9.
Neurontin 300 mg per GJ tube tid  The patient would need daily dressing changes for his GJ tube and [**Hospital1 **] wet to dry dressing changes for his left elbow pressure ulcer.
His tube feeds were started at ProMod with fiber with a goal of 55 cc per hour, hold for abdominal distention or abdominal pain.
