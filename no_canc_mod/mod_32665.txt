Her typical headaches in the past have typically been left temporoparietal in distribution, occasional with radiation to the front of the head and the neck.
On [**12-27**], the patient reports the onset of a different kind of headache while riding in the car.
She experienced the same double vision as with other headaches.
She had some mild nausea and "awkward on [my] feet" over the following week.
CT head there demonstrated showed a small amount of bilateral SAH, for which she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.
Here, a NCHCT showed scattered foci of SAH in frontal lobes bilaterally, without mass effect; no aneurysm seen on CT.
The patient was admitted by neurosurgery, who performed cerebral angiogram that reported foci of stenosis in both posterior cerebral arteries and their branches.
There was concern for vasculitis or focal spasm.
While atherosclerosis was also considered, there was no evidence of atherosclerosis elsewhere in the interrogated vasculature.

The CTA examination demonstrates mild atheromatous disease at the right common carotid bifurcation, and otherwise appears normal.
No evidence of an aneurysm or a vascular malformation.
Foci of stenosis in both posterior cerebral arteries and their branches.
This may be related to vasculitis or focal spasm.
While atherosclerosis may also be considered, there is no evidence of atherosclerosis elsewhere in the interrogated vasculature.
Anterior communicating artery is not visualized, likely representing aplasia or hypoplasia.
Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, consistent with 12/29 CTA head.
Scattered subcortical acute infarcts located bilaterally in the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres, of unclear etiology.
No findings of demyelinating disease.
<br> CT HEAD [**2188-1-9**]: Unchanged mild subarachnoid hemorrhage with no new bleeding or fracture.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 48-year-old woman with a history of migraine headaches, hypertension, cervical and lumbar spondylosis, and depression who presented with headache.
Prior to admission, she had had a CT that showed small foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
A cerebral angiogram revealed no aneurysm, but concern for  foci of stenosis in both posterior cerebral arteries and their branches that could be related to vasculitis or focal spasm.
The presentation was consistent with Call-[**Doctor Last Name 8271**] Syndrome, or reversible cerebral artery vasoconstriction.
This was confirmed with serial transcranial dopplers demonstrating increased velocities.
Her gait initially appeared somewhat unsteady, but she was able to walk with a narrow base.
Butalbital-Acetaminophen-Caff 50-325-40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for headache.
You were found to have Call-[**Doctor Last Name 8271**] Syndrome that caused small bleeding in your head.
If you have any new symptoms such as vertigo, facial droop, difficulty speaking, difficulty swallowing, one-sided weakness, sensory loss, or any other symptom that is concerning to you, please call your PCP or go to the nearest hospital emergency department.
