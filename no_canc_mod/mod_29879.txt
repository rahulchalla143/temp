Admission Date:  [**2124-3-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2124-3-17**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**] Chief Complaint: fevers with cough  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: This is an 85 y/o female with a PMH significant for Alzheimer's dementia, CHF, HTN, AF on coumadin, who initially was admitted to the Medicine service with increased cough and fevers x 1 week, thought to be from aspiration PNA on [**2124-3-9**].
On [**2124-3-11**], the patient had a HR of 40's to 50's with SBP's in the 110-130's and some degree of mental status changes with lethargy.
The patient regained some degree of MS during the transfer and her HR returned to the 40's to 50's.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], her course was notable for a few episodes of asymptomatic bradycardia while sleeping and a 3-second pause on telemetry.
It was recommended that the patient continue her current diet of thin liquids and purees, as a PEG tube/NPO status will likely not not decrease her aspiration risk given her advanced dementia status.
The patient was able to answer very few question and did report some pain in her extremities.

Atrophic changes.
Possible chronic small subdural collection along the right anterior frontal convexity."
No focal consolidations are seen.

Brief Hospital Course: 85yo F with CAD, PVD s/p CVA with dementia (vascular vs. Alzheimer's) and DM who was found to be bradycardic to 30s and obtunded on the floor.
The pt was initially admitted to the Medicine service with a chief complaint of fevers with cough thought to be due to aspiration PNA on [**2124-3-9**].
Throughout the course of the day of [**2124-3-11**], the pt continued to have a HR of 40s to 50s with systolic blood pressure of 110-130s and some degree of mental status change with lethargy.
In addition, the pt regained some degree of mental status and was able to interact.
Bradycardia - Likely due to conduction abnormality rather than BB.
Her EKGs show afib with slow ventricular response.
Per cardiology consult, no need for transcutaneous pacer was warranted given her poor prognosis.
Bradycardia may be secondary to intrinsic conduction disease vs. vagal response.
Mental status changes - Initial obtundation likely [**3-16**] poor perfusion from bradycardia.
Considered MRI/MRA to evaluate for further progression of vascular dementia if mental status were to deteriorate; however, MS improved back to baseline after bradycardia resolved.
CAD - Pt had no symptoms of CP, and helding BB in setting of bradycardia, although this would be beneficial in CAD.
Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] held [**3-16**] h/o GI bleed while pt was on both [**Month/Day (2) **] and coumadin.
CHF - Pt has h/o CHF with unknown EF; baseline TTE during this hospitalization showed EF >55%.
Aspiration PNA - Pt had no signs of PNA on CXR, but pt was admitted with fevers and productive cough concerning for URI.
Has a h/o aspiration PNA in the past.
Hypothyroidism - Continued synthroid.
She had no evidence of active bleeding.
Sacral decub - She had no evidence of wound infections; continued ascorbic acid and zinc supplements.

Please note the following changes to your medications: -ferrous sulfate - for anemia (low blood counts) -zinc sulfate, multivitamin, ascorbic acid, collagenase ointment - to help with wound healing -lansoprazole - to help protect the lining of the stomach; acid reflux -isosorbide dinitrate - this will replace the 30mg you were taking before.
