Delayed R wave progression with late precordial QRS transition.
CXR ([**6-9**]):  Brief Hospital Course: 62F with h/o MS, sarcoid, HTN, hyperlipidemia, DMII, CAD s/p stents, PAD s/p L BKA, h/o CVA and recurrent DVTs who was recently admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 100782**] for dyspnea and was treated for exacerbation of reactive airway disease in setting of recent URI, now presented back to ED for shortness of breath and wheezing, likely from exactly the same etiology: exacerbation of reactive airway disease/asthma/COPD.
# Dyspnea: The patient has known reactive airways disease/Asthma/COPD and this appears to be an exacerbation of the same process during her prior hospitalization.
She does not appear fluid overloaded, BNP 41, no evidence of PNA on CXR, and she refused CTA to rule out PE but has been on warfarin.
They recommended CT chest, which showed evidence of bronchitis.
ECHO showed normal EF with no valvular abnormalities.
Patient reports she has no nebulizers at home, which is surprising since she has been discharged home with nebulizers every time when she was discharged recently.
# Recent UTI: Patient had continued evidence of infection on UA with chronic indwelling foley.
She had known Pan-sensitive Proteus.
Of note, she did not fill her Bactrim for UTI prescription on discharge.
# Diabetes Mellitus/Hypoglycemia/Altered mental status: On the morning of [**6-14**] the pt was found to be altered on the floor.
Patient's insulin dose was decreased afterwards, and she had no more episodes of hypoglycemia.
# Chest pain/hypotension: After pts episode of hypoglycemia, she began to complain of substernal chest pain, similar in character to her ongoing angina.
She was given SL NTG, after which she became hypotensive and remained that way for 3-4 hours on the floor.
The patient was transferred to the MICU at that point for her ongoing hemodynamic instability.
She remained chest pain free.
# History of Recurrent DVTs: Coumadin was continued.
LENIS showed that while no DVT was definitively seen, the right distal superficial femoral vein did not fully compress, and a nonocclusive thrombus could not be completely excluded.
# PAD s/p L BKA: Patient has a healing ulcer on RLE.
# Seizure Disorder: Carbamazepime was continued.
