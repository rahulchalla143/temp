Found to be pulseless and in ventricular fibrillation.
The patient was bagged and transported to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital continuing to have episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.
She received a bolus of Amiodarone times three and then was found to have similar ST elevations in leads 3 and AVF.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2128-9-17**] elevation, myocardial infarction with ventricular fibrillation arrest.
Cardiac catheterization was notable for the following, proximal right coronary artery had 80% stenosis, diffusely diseased, mid right coronary artery 80% stenosis and 80% stenosis of the distal right coronary artery with a total of four stents employed with a gap left in the mid right coronary artery in the distribution of a relatively normal vessel.
There was a Type B dissection in the mid vessel, but clinically she was treated with two of these four stents.
Rapid fluid was used to predilate stenosis.
The patient was successfully weaned and extubated off of the vent, however, due to acute agitation and confusion, status post catheterization believed due to ethyl alcohol withdrawal, despite treatments with Ativan and Haldol, she was intubated for protection.
The patient's course was complicated at that point with Streptococcal pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The patient's course was notable for poor absorption from her nasogastric tube with high tube feed residuals, prompting placement now of the gastrostomy tube by General Surgery at the bedside.
A noncontrast head computerized tomography scan was also performed which showed no signs of acute bleed.
