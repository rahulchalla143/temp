Patient has no corneals, no gag, no cough.
Pertinent Results: CT head from OSH: No hemorrhage appreciated.
There are multiple areas of skull fracture in the occipital region.
No epidural hematoma is seen.
MRV HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2195-5-1**] 12:27 AM FINDINGS: There is no acute infarct seen.
Hemorrhagic contusions are identified involving both cerebellar tonsils with increased signal seen within both cerebellar tonsils, which are displaced inferiorly to the upper cervical region.
Additionally, foci of hemorrhage are seen in the left cerebellar hemisphere along the vermis and also along the lateral aspect of the cerebellum adjacent to the left occipital bone fracture.
There is no hydrocephalus seen.
There is no midline shift.
Mucosal changes are seen in the sinuses.
Left occipital bone deformity identified with hemorrhagic contusions in the left cerebellar hemisphere and also involving both cerebellar tonsils.
Focus of increased signal around the fourth ventricle on FLAIR with involvement of the left facial colliculus.
This could also reflect edema from contusion.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage with blood within the lateral ventricles.
No evidence of hydrocephalus.
The left transverse sinus demonstrates narrowing in its midportion at the site of fracture.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of sinus thrombosis.
Allowing for this difference both brachial plexi morphologically appear normal without evidence of adjacent hematoma or avulsion.
There is striking edema within the cerebellar tonsils as well as the left cerebellar hemisphere.
Cerebellar tonsils appear slightly inferiorly herniated which is better evaluated on a prior MRI/MRA brain.
There is edema within the left occipital bone.
Note is made of consolidation at the left lung base, which is likely due to aspiration and/or contusion.
There is prominent edema throughout the left paraspinal muscles, particularly involving the semispinalis capitis and splenius capitis with edema approaching the lower cervical spinal nerve roots but not abutting them.
2) Extensive left paraspinal muscle injury as above.
3) Left cerebellar hemisphere and cerebellar tonsillar contusions; please see prior MRI brain for better assessment.
4) Left lung base consolidation, which in this setting is likely due to aspiration and/or contusion.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2195-5-2**] 9:42 AM FINDINGS: Similar appearance to subdural blood layering along the tentorium bilaterally.
Subarachnoid blood in the posterior horns of lateral ventricles and interpeduncular cistern is unchanged.
Frontoparietal subarachnoid blood layering in the sulci towards the vertex is similar to prior (series 2, image 23).
Punctate foci consistent with contusion are again seen in the cerebellum.
Again seen is diffuse sulcal effacement consistent with mild global edema.
There is persistent mild effacement of the fourth ventricle.
There is no shift of normally midline structures and no evidence of major vascular territorial infarct.
Again seen is an extensively comminuted left occipital bone fracture extending into the skull base (for details see the CT of [**2195-4-30**]).
There is subcutaneous emphysema in the left occipital subgaleal tissues with overlying skin staples, unchanged from prior.
Mucosal thickening is again seen in the ethmoidal, sphenoidal and bilateral maxillary sinuses with circumferential thickening on the right.
Stable appearance of subdural hemorrhage layering along the tentorium and stable appearance of subarachnoid hemorrhage including layering in the lateral ventricles and interpeduncular cistern.
Cerebellar contusion.
Mild global edema persists with mild effacement of the fourth ventricle, but no midline shift and no interval change in ventricular size.
Interval improvement in diffuse sulcal effacement as well as mass effect on the fourth ventricle.
Interval evolution of subdural hematoma and cerebellar contusion, with resorption of subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage.
Thick rim-enhancing subcutaneous fluid collection abutting the fracture site and extending inferiorly which appears to be increasing in size.
Assessment for change and enhancement is not possible given lack of any prior contrast-enhanced studies.
Regions of enhancement surrounding the previously described hemorrhagic contusions within the left cerebellar tonsil and left cerebral hemisphere.
While this finding can be seen in noninfected hematomas, given the overlying suspicious fluid collection, additional foci of infection cannot be excluded by imaging.

Provisional Findings Impression: JKPe MON [**2195-5-11**] 8:06 PM There is interval increase in size to a rim-enhancing left posterior occipital fluid collection tracking from the bony fracture site inferiorly which is suspicious for superinfection.
Additional smaller foci of enhancement involving the left cerebellum and left cerebellar tonsil are noted at the site of prior hemorrhagic contusions and likely relate to enhancement around the hematoma although superinfection cannot be excluded by imaging.
Final Report HISTORY: Rising white cell count with known left occipital open skull fracture status post washout and closure.
CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Unenhanced images of the brain display hypodensity at the patient's known sites of prior hemorrhagic contusions within the left cerebellar tonsil and left cerebellar hemisphere.
The brain parenchyma appears otherwise normal with no new regions of hemorrhage noted.
A 13 x 27 mm (AP and TR) thick rim-enhancing fluid collection is noted to extend craniocaudally from the fracture site inferiorly along the left occipital bone.
Mild induration of the adjacent subcutaneous fat is noted along this collection.
Additional non-liquified enhancing components are also present more inferiorly within the posterior musculature.
Additionally, adjacent to the fracture site, there is mild enhancement noted along the previously demarcate hemorrhagic left cerebellar contusions, the one more laterally is less conspicuous than the 9 x 11 mm more medial collection.
Additional smaller foci of enhancement are noted within the left cerebellar tonsil which was also noted to have a hemorrhagic contusion on prior MR.
The degree of mass effect within the posterior fossa appears slightly improved with post-surgical changes from prior suboccipital craniotomy again noted.
There is increased opacification involving the right maxillary sinus with remaining paranasal sinuses displaying minimal mucosal disease.
Mild opacification of both of the mastoid air cells bilaterally is also unchanged.
Thick rim-enhancing subcutaneous fluid collection abutting the fracture site and extending inferiorly which appears to be increasing in size.

Provisional Findings Impression: JKPe MON [**2195-5-18**] 7:44 PM PFI: Marked interval decrease in size of rim-enhancing posterior subcutaneous fluid collection with small approximately 9 x 25 mm rim-enhancing collection noted to persist inferiorly.
The regions of intraparenchymal rim enhancement surrounding the prior sites of hemorrhagic contusions are less conspicuous on today's exam which suggests no underlying parenchymal infection.
Final Report HISTORY: Open ankle fracture status post debridement of superinfected subcutaneous collection.
CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Unenhanced images of the brain demonstrate no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of midline structures, hydrocephalus, or acute major vascular territorial infarct.
Regions of low attenuation within the left cerebellar hemisphere and vermis persist and correlate to the sites of prior intraparenchymal hemorrhagic contusions.
Post-contrast administration there is better identification of improvement of the previously identified large thick rim-enhancing subcutaneous fluid collection which has underwent interval evacuation.
There is some persistent fluid noted about the skull fracture site with subcutaneous emphysema; however, the rim-enhancing component has decreased with only a small pocket noted to persist inferiorly measuring 9 x 25 mm (series 3 image 5).
Additional post-surgical changes involving the suboccipital craniotomy are stable as is the overall appearance of the minimally displaced left occipital skull fracture.
There is no finding to suggest underlying osteomyelitis.
The regions of intraparenchymal contusion again display very mild rim enhancement; however, this is less conspicuous than the most recent enhanced examination of [**5-11**] suggesting evolving intraparenchymal hematomas.
Moderate-to-severe chronic mucosal thickening involving the right maxillary sinus and right [**Doctor Last Name 13856**] bullosa are again noted.
There is partial opacification noted to persist involving the right mastoid air cells.
Significant interval decrease in size to the known superinfected subcutaneous fluid collection abutting the fracture site.
Only a small pocket remains which displays rim enhancement more inferiorly.
Decreased rim enhancement surrounding the hemorrhagic intraparenchymal contusions involving the left cerebellar hemisphere with no new regions of intraparenchymal enhancement or extra-axial fluid collections to suggest subdural/epidural empyema.

He was taken to the OR where under general anesthesia he underwent a wound washout with minimal elevation of depressed skull fracture.
On exam he was found to have left upper extremity weakness.
He underwent CT c-spine that showed no fracture and cervical MRI which showed no ligamentous injury.
He also had brachial plexus MRI which showed no injury.
He also had MRV which showed the left transverse sinus demonstrating narrowing in its midportion at the site of fracture and therefore was started on aspirin.
EEG testing was completed which showed Left slowing, no seizure foci.
Speech and swallowing evaluation was done and he was started on a regular; dysphagia diet with no difficulty.
CT of the head was negative for new findings.
His wound looked clean with a small area of scabbing vs necrosis and was without drainage.
His CT revealed thick rim enhancing subcutaneous fluid collection abuting fracture site with enhancement surrounding the site was concering for infection, wound was aspirated and sent for cultures.
The following day, patient had a nonfocal exam and recieved a lumbar puncture to rule out central nervous system infection.
He was brought to the OR on [**2195-5-13**] after bedside eval of wound revealed active exudative drainage.
