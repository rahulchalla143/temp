HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50 year old man with a history of polysubstance abuse including Cocaine, Heroin and alcohol, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, restrictive lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hypertension, who presented with hypotension, hypoxia and unresponsiveness.
The [**Hospital 228**] medical course began when he was diagnosed with mild pneumonia on [**2195-10-17**], after presenting to an outside hospital with shortness of breath and productive cough.
The patient was found to have a right lower lobe infiltrate thought to be aspiration.
The patient then presented to the Emergency Department on [**2195-11-2**], with chest pain and dysarthria.
Neurology consultation concluded that he had a toxic metabolic encephalopathy as the workup included negative toxicology screen, lumbar puncture and electroencephalogram.
On [**2195-11-5**], the patient was found to have a distended acute abdomen with an abdominal CT that showed portal venous air and the patient was taken emergently to the operating room where he was found to have toxic megacolon.
The patient underwent total colectomy with a mucous fistula and ileostomy.
The pathology showed pseudomembranous focal hemorrhage as well as wall thickening and patchy ulceration which suggested ischemia and possibly infectious etiologies, although the findings seem to correlate with a vascular pattern.
On postoperative day five, the patient developed copious ostomy output four to five liters per day and progressive volume depletion.
At rehabilitation, the patient had frequent large volume occult blood positive stool and intermittent clear nausea and vomiting which improved with Nexium.
The patient had tarry stools on [**2195-11-24**].
On [**2195-11-27**], at 7:15 a.m., the patient was found to be unresponsive with coffee brown liquidy ooze around his mouth.
In the Intensive Care Unit, he grew four out of four blood culture bottles positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
He had a temporary pressor requirement but was gradually weaned off pressors.
Schizophrenia versus schizo-affective disorder.
PPD positive.
History of recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Urinary tract infection.
Mild restrictive lung disease.
History of staphylococcus endocarditis.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Hypertension and alcohol abuse.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination revealed pale conjunctiva.
Anicteric sclera with green OGT drainage.
Cardiac examination revealed regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The chest examination revealed lungs that had decreased breath sounds on the left and clear to auscultation on the right.
Abdominal examination revealed a softly distended abdomen with some discomfort to palpation and no clear distribution.
No bowel sounds were heard and no masses were felt.
The patient had a well healing incision with mucous fistula that appeared noninfected.
There was liquid brown stool that was occult blood positive.
Chest x-ray with left linear atelectasis versus infiltrate.
There was a left subclavian line in the mid superior vena cava.
There was a biphasic T wave in V2 and mildly peaked T waves in V3 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This 50 year old man with a history of polysubstance abuse, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, question of schizophrenia, restrictive lung disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, presented in septic shock with four out of four blood culture bottles positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus but no documented source.
The patient also presented in acute renal failure and with pancreatitis.
Pulmonary - The patient was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and extubated on [**2195-11-30**].
There was question of recurrent aspiration although the chest x-ray did not appear to impressively suggest that.
The patient was maintained in room air upon transfer to a floor bed and continued to do well from a respiratory standpoint.
Repeated chest x-rays showed bilateral basilar opacities which were thought to be aspiration pneumonia.
Initially, the patient was not treated for this but did develop low grade fever and was eventually started on Levofloxacin.
The patient did not have a strong history for aspiration and was not placed on antibiotics for aspiration initially.
Infectious disease - The patient presented septic requiring pressors with four out of four bottles positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus without a clear source.
A transthoracic echocardiogram done in the Medical Intensive Care Unit showed no evidence of vegetation, however, was of suboptimal image quality.
Other sources of the positive blood cultures included abdominal source since the patient had recently undergo in-hospital abdominal surgery.
An abdominal ultrasound and renal ultrasound revealed no evidence of abscess or dilated ducts.
No evidence of renal abscess and unremarkable kidneys with no lower abdominal collections.
An abdominal CT was pursued which revealed small pleural effusions and nonobstructing clot in the SMV.
There was no evidence of ischemia.
No abscesses or other abnormalities were noted.
HCV PCR revealed nondetectable viral load.
Because the patient had persistent tenderness over his lower back including L4-L5 and L5-S1, a magnetic resonance scan was done of the back which revealed subtle T11 to T12 increase intensity on the T2 images.
The patient had wound cultures sent from his abdominal wound which showed moderate growth, coagulase positive Staphylococcus.
Repeated chest x-rays showed persistent bibasilar opacities consistent with aspiration.
The patient also was found to have a patent foramen ovale which was found to be small.
It was then thought that the source of possible embolic event may have been from endocarditis.
Cardiovascular - The patient with transesophageal echocardiogram revealing a 4.0 millimeter vegetation and a patent foramen ovale.
Paradoxical embolus was thought to be unlikely given the size of the patent foramen ovale.
Lower extremity ultrasound looking for source of paradoxical emboli was negative bilaterally.
CT surgery followed the patient while in the hospital and did not see any acute intervention being indicated.
The patient was only found to have 2+ aortic insufficiency on transesophageal echocardiogram and no evidence of valve damage or paravalvular abscess.
Renal - The patient was found to have acute renal failure upon presentation and upon examination of the urine was found to have coarse muddy brown casts consistent with acute tubular necrosis.
The patient was also markedly dehydrated because of high ostomy output.
Thus, his renal failure was thought to be secondary to acute tubular necrosis and prerenal causes.
Psychiatric - The patient with reported history of schizophrenia versus schizo-affective disorder.
Psychiatry followed the patient while in hospital and felt there was no current indication for antipsychotic pharmacology.
The patient also with a history of depression treated with Prozac.
Gastrointestinal - The patient with pancreatitis with increasing lipase and amylase but no evidence of inflammation on abdominal CT.
The patient was also found to be gastric occult positive in the Intensive Care Unit but stable on the floor.
