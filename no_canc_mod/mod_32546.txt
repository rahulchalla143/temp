Moderate-severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
No LV mass/thrombus.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity.
Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views.
Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal views.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Her  heart failure and renal failure was stabilized.
She received vancomycin for perioperative anitbiotics due to being in hospital prior to surgery.
Gynecology was consulted and ruled out current recto-vaginal fistula, and pessary was removed, cleaned and replaced.
She was restarted on home diabetic medications and had episode of hypoglycemia without any mental status changes and treated with intravenous dextrose including drip and oral agents and insulin stopped [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recommendations.
