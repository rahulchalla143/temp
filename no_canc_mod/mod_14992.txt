Erythema and congestion in the duodenal bulb compatible with mild duodenitis.
Erythema and congestion in the antrum and pre-pyloric region compatible with mild gastritis.
Bedside swallow evaluation: This swallowing pattern correlates to a Dysphagia Outcome Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of level 5, mild dysphagia.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 81 year-old female with a no significant past medical hx who presented from an OSH s/p complicated hospital course due to cholecystitis and ARF.
# Cholecystitis - Pt underwent successful ERCP with biliary stent placement right on admission [**10-1**].
Leukocytosis has since resolved and pt was afebrile in the ICU.
Liver and Gallbladder US on [**2173-10-2**] revealed moderate dilation of the CBD with stent in place.
Hct drop: During hospitalization she developed progressive drop in Hct/Hgb with continued urethral bleed and black guaiac positive stool.
In addition, She had ecchymosis with SC soft tissue small hematomas.
GI was consulted for slowly declining hematocrit and reports of melena and she underwent EGD that only showed gastritis and duodenitis.
Her stool was observed to be dark brown and guaiac positive but not true melena.
She may have a small bleeding source in the lower GI tract, but as her Hct remained stable in the 27-30 range, colonoscopy was deferred to the outpatient setting.
Her urethral bleeding was thought to be from repeated straight cathing, which was stopped, and this bleeding subsided.
During hospitalization, pt was noted to have dialysis reaction with agitation, tachycardia, and sob.
Acute post ERCP Pancreatitis: Patient with pacnreatitis by labs, likely post-ERCP.
Patient without significant epigastric pain and after lipase started trending down, she was restarted on PO intake, tolerating soft regular diet.
There is significant language barrier as she is Cantonese speaking only.
Her altered mental status was thought to be secondary to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from infection, bleed, and azotemia.
By time of discharge, she returned to her baseline mental status per family.
# Dysphagia: The patient developed difficulty swallowing solids and a speech and swallow consult was placed which suggested that patient is safe to drink thin liquids, but pt appeared to have less difficulty with nectar-thick liquids.
