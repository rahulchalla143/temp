She also had a fever to 101??????
At home, she had been using home nebulizers without improvement.
The patient has also been noted to have substernal chest pain in the past, variably responsive to sublingual nitroglycerin.
At the time of admission, she was noted to be diaphoretic and nauseous, but denied vomiting, orthopnea, lower extremity edema, chills, lightheadedness, abdominal pain, bright red blood per rectum, melena or dysuria.
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was given frequent nebulizers secondary to tachypnea and low saturations on 2 liters of nasal cannula.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home O2, 2 liters nasal cannula, has had four to five hospitalizations in the past year.
Ejection fraction of 45%, mild aortic regurgitation.
Prior echocardiogram showed cardiomyopathy and pulmonary hypertension.
Hypothyroidism  SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone, has home VNA, has a daughter.
GENERAL:  She is in no apparent distress on nasal oxygen, has a nebulizer on at the time of admission.
NECK:  No jugular venous distention.
LUNGS:  Poor air movement, occasional wheezing, no consolidations were appreciated.
HEART:  Tachycardia 2 to [**3-14**], left upper sternal border murmur, ?
EXTREMITIES:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
IMAGING:  Chest x-ray revealed no pneumonia or congestive heart failure, but did reveal a calcified left hilar lymph node.
Her chest x-ray on [**5-23**] revealed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/emphysema, no pneumonia or congestive heart failure.
Echocardiogram on [**2197-1-24**] showed ejection fraction of 45%, moderate aortic regurgitation, trace mitral regurgitation.
ASSESSMENT:  A 73-year-old woman with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, mild cardiomyopathy ?
admitted with chest pain (ruled out), shortness of breath (refractory to home nebulizers, but responsive to the Emergency Department/MICU continuous nebulizers), 7 to 10 days of cough and fever likely representing community acquired pneumonia.
She was admitted for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
Her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare was thought to be a result of increased dyspnea secondary to acute bronchitis with some component of anxiety leading to a decreased respiratory rate which causes hyperinflation and then dyspnea.
It has also been suggested that her steroid might benefit her, ALTHOUGH SHE DOES HAVE A HISTORY OF ALLERGIC REACTIONS TO INHALED STEROIDS.
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE FLARE:  On [**2197-5-24**], the patient was continued on Solu-Medrol with plans to switch to po prednisone when she was more stable.
Levaquin was continued for bronchitic component.
On [**2197-5-26**], overnight, she was noted to have shortness of breath and chest pain with pursed lip breathing noted.
The chest pain revealed sinus tachycardia without changes from her prior electrocardiogram and her chest pain was relieved with two sublingual nitroglycerin and 2 mg of subcutaneous morphine.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had a fever and cough on admission.
Although she did not have evidence of pneumonia on chest x-ray, it was felt she might have had bacterial bronchitis as of [**2197-5-24**].
CARDIOVASCULAR:  She has a history of chest pain, but ruled out on this admission.
She was maintained on Imdur, sublingual nitroglycerin, ACE inhibitors and Digoxin, as well as her hypothyroid medication.
HEME:  She had a low white blood cells as an aberrant lab value which was repeated.
ALLERGIES:  SHE IS INTOLERANT TO ASPIRIN, IT CAUSES GASTROINTESTINAL UPSET AND SHE IS INTOLERANT TO BETA BLOCKERS BECAUSE OF HER CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE.
