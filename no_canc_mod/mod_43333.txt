Admission Date:  [**2196-11-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2196-12-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2133-3-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Iodine; Iodine Containing / Vantin / Cephalosporins / Adhesive Tape / Levofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**] Chief Complaint: [**First Name3 (LF) **] and malaise   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 y/o woman with a h/o gastric bypass s/p recent revision who presented with generalized weakness and fatigue for 4 days and [**Known lastname **] to 102.
However, her surgeon did not believe this to be a GI source.
Her PCP subsequently referred her to the ED for orthostasis and [**Known lastname **] (T 100.2).
She had no change in mental status with this episode.
She denies having any localizing symptoms.
She has had no cough/sore throat, no SOB, no abdominal pain/N/V/Diarrhea, no BRBPR.
No myalgias/arthralgias, no back pain.
ROS only notable for chills/sweats/malaise.
CXR w/ no infiltrate.
In the MICU, she was treated with vancomycin, ampillicin-sulbactam, and [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim showed a basal level > 20 but a small increase.
Aortic Insufficiency and Mitral Regurgitation [**1-28**] phen-phen use.
Left ureteral stone, s/p stent placement.
Well-healed surgical scars without evidence of infection.
Pertinent Results: Studies:  - EKG [**11-28**]: Junctional rhythm at 94, nl intervals, no ST changes  - CXR [**11-28**]: Low lung volumes, particularly on the left.
No consolidation or effusion evident.
No intra-abdominal fluid collections.
Bibasilar patchy opacities could represent consolidation Vs. atelectasis; aspiration is a likely possibility.
Interval resolution of small bowel obstruction.
Low attenuation lesion within right hepatic dome, unchanged.
New 4 mm pulmonary nodule at the right apex, follow up should be obtained in 12 months if patient doesn't have risk factors.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.19cm2) Mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The patient has moderate aortic stenosis.
Based on [**2195**] ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is asymptomatic, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in [**12-28**] years.
Based on [**2186**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2194-7-16**], the aortic stenosis has progressed.
There is more mitral and aortic regurgitation on the current study.
No obvious vegetations are visualized; if clinically indicated, a TEE may better evaluate for endocarditis.
- CXR [**12-2**]: Increasing bibasilar opacities and left lower lobe atelectasis.
Findings could all be due to atelectasis, but may also represent aspiration or developing pneumonia.
- CXR [**12-6**]: Bilateral patchy infiltrates in the posterior bases indicative of bronchopneumonic infiltrates.
Mild-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions in the posterior sinuses.
- CXR [**12-9**]: Recurrence of bibasilar opacification right greater than left.
After improvement between [**12-2**] and [**12-6**], accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion suggests that this is all probably pulmonary edema.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are new as well.
- ECG [**12-9**]: Regular rhythm - may be sinus tachycardia with first degree A-V delay but baseline artifact makes assessment difficult.
Nonspecific T wave abnormalities.
Since previous tracing of [**2196-12-10**], further T wave changes present.
-ALT: [**11-29**]: 53 -> [**12-7**]: 24 -> [**12-9**] (PM): 124 -AST: [**11-29**]: 39 -> [**12-7**]: 23 -> [**12-9**] (PM): 320 -T.bili: [**11-29**]: 0.3 -> [**12-7**]: 1.0 -> [**12-9**] (PM) 0.8 -LDH: [**12-4**]: 335 -> [**12-7**]: 364 -> [**12-9**] (PM): 1106 -Albumin: 2.0 -VBG ([**12-9**] AM): 7.40/18/214/12 -ABG ([**12-9**] PM): 7.14/11/192/4   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was a 63-year-old woman who was status post gastric bypass with a recent revision roughly 7 weeks prior to admission and a history of hypothyroidism who presented with a generalized malaise and [**Known lastname **] for 4 days prior to admission.
Fevers and generalized malaise.
Although some evidence was found of infection, no definite cause of her acute illness was ever clinically diagnosed.
Initially, because she was hypotensive and tachycardic, she was admitted to the MICU.
On the floor, her course was generally characterized by stable blood pressures but mild tachypnea, with respiratory rates generally between 22 and 26 per minute.
For much of the first several days of her admission she was febrile, but by the second half of her hospitalization she had defervesced, with only one elevated temperature in the final six days of her stay.
Attempts to find a cause of her illness were complicated by her lack of symptoms.
Until the final day, her only complaints were generalized weakness and fatigue.
She did report some diarrhea, but noted that it was small in volume and consistent with her previous bowel movements following her multiple gastric surgeries.
She had two blood culture bottles drawn during her initial visit to the ED that subsequently grew coagulase-negative staph.
This was considered to be a contaminant by the Infectious Diseases consultants as multiple subsequent blood cultures showed no growth.
However, although she did not have a line at the time of presentation, she did have a history of PICC line infections with the same organism that showed similar patterns of antibiotic resistance.
It was suggested, therefore, that this may have been the exacerbation of a previous line infection that had theretofore been subclinical.
This, too, was not believed to be the source of her fevers as she had no symptoms of a UTI and her urinalysis from that day was clean, having no WBC or bacteria.
Additionally, samples of her stool produced no growth in culture and were negative for C. difficile toxin.
A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no evidence of endocarditis.
A CT angiogram to look for PE was also considered.
Finally, a CT of the torso was performed that showed no significant intra-abdominal pathology but did reveal bilateral basilar infiltrates suggestive of an aspiration pneumonia.
Unfortunately, as she had no cough at any time, she could not produce sputum for culture or antibiotic-sensitivity testing.
Zosyn was stopped after nine days, when she had shown clinical improvement (afebrile for 72 hours, WBC count falling from peak of 36 to 26, respiratory rate decreased from 26 to 22) and when the Hematology consultants suggested that it may be responsible for her worsening thrombocytopenia (see below).
These therapies had produced an apparent improvement - though not a resolution - in her clinical symptoms and lab values until the final day of her hospitalization (see Dispo below).
She was thrombocytopenic on admission and showed a steady decline in her platelet level.
This could have been due to her acute infection, but other testing was done.
There was no evidence of hemolysis or neurologic dysfunction, making TTP less likely.
DVT prophylaxis was effected with pneumatic boots.
Notably, the rapid decline in her platelet count in the final few hours of her hospitalization marked a much faster fall than had previously been exhibited and may well have been the result of DIC at that point.
Low bicarbonate.
She consistently had a low bicarbonate, but also no elevation in her anion gap and only a slight elevation of lactate.
Only on the last day, when she was becoming increasingly tachypneic, did she allow the ABG, and even then only if it was performed by the ID fellow who had been following her case, further delaying diagnosis at a critical time.
Prior to that, we had presumed the low bicarbonate reflected diarrheal losses or an iatrogenic hyperchloremic acidosis.
Her chest x-rays had suggested pulmonary edema, and she had increasing pedal edema.
Until that point, she had been aggressively hydrated to compensate for presumed infection and diarrheal losses.
She was noted to have a poor nutritional status after gastric bypass with multiple revisions.
Acute Renal Failure.
This was thought likely due to diarrhea combined with acute stress (catecholamine response); she was repleted to maintain K > 3.6. .
She had no apparent complications from her recent revision of her gastric bypass.
Her iron studies suggested anemia of chronic disease.
She was not B12 deficient and there was no evidence of hemolysis.
She was transfused with one unit of packed RBC with the thought that this might improve her symptoms of tachycardia and fatigue.
Dispo: On the final day of her hospitalization, she complained of subjective dyspnea for the first time.
Before further diagnostic or therapeutic interventions could be enacted, she became markedly tachypneic, and "triggered" for a respiratory rate of 36.
The day prior, several physicians, including the ID consultants, had been of the opinion that her primary problem was no longer infectious.
Only later in the day, when she was in increasing respiratory distress, were we able to obtain an ABG that suggested she was then acidotic.
With the elevated temperature and lactate seen at that time, sepsis became the likely cause.
A code blue was called to intubate her on the floor; during the intubation she became bradycardic and received atropine and epinephrine.
