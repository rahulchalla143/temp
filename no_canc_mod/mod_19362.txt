The right epididymis is mildly prominent by size with normal blood flow.
The left epididymis is enlarged with marked hyperemia.
IMPRESSION: Left epididymitis without orchitis.
There has been interval removal of a left PICC line.
Bilateral spinal rods are again noted.
However, small underlying consolidation is not excluded and attention at followup chest radiographs is advised.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
- CT ABD WITH IV and ORAL CONTRAST: This is limited by the patient's marked rotary scoliosis and extensive metallic star artifact from the spinal fixation rods.
There is heterogeneous enhancement of the right kidney worrisome for pyelonephritis.
There is no perinephric abscess seen.
There is enlarged left paraaortic lymph node at the hilum of the left kidney measuring 3.4 cm, possibly suggestive of reactive lymphadenopathy.
There is no organized abscess within the kidney or in the perinephric area that would be amendable to drainage.
The left ureter is not visualized; however, there is no evidence of hydronephrosis to suggest obstruction on this current study.
Evaluation of intra abdominal loops of bowel with significant star artifact from the hardware.
- CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no free air or free fluid within the pelvis.
The bladder wall is circumferentially thickened and unchanged from prior consistent with known history of neurogenic bladder.
Numerous enlarged inguinal lymph nodes with the largest measuring 1.1 cm (2, 51).
There is no evidence of hardware failure or spinal fixation device.
As mentioned, there is marked rotary scoliosis.
There are rods, hooks and cerclage wire is seen throughout the visualized distal thoracic and lumbar spine without any evidence of mechanical hardware failure.
Heterogenous enhancement of the left kidney worrisome for pyelonephritis.
There no perinephric abscess.
There is no hydronephrosis.
There is no perinephric, intraabdominal or intrapelvic fluid collection 3.
Brief Hospital Course: 35M with paraplegia, recurrent UTI/nephrolithiasis, and h/o recurrent MRSA peri-rectal abscesses presented with fever/chills, foul smelling urine, abdominal and testicular pain, and reported history of blood streaked emesis.
Likely secondary to stopping his prophylactic macrobid 1-2 weeks ago and persistent self straight catheterizations.
CT suggestive of pyelonephritis, no clear abscess.
Patient has had recurrent UTIs and nephrolithiasis in past, mostly E.coli sensitive to ceftriaxone, meropenum, zosyn and others.
He has a history of MRSA colonization.
Likely gastroenteritis, may have been bacterial or viral contaminant in food from restaurant, possibly Staph aureus secondary to acute nature of vomitting after eating.
His symptoms completely resolved while in the hospital.
Hematemesis, mild (streaks).
No signs of coffee ground emesis to suggest PUD.
There was Hct drop, but likely dilutional in nature as he is about 6L positive.
Baseline has anemia of chronic inflammation by previous iron studies.
Also the more acute change is likely dilutional given about 6L positive since admission to the ICU and unlikely from the mild hematemesis noted above as that resolved.
He does not have any active signs of bleeding after resolution of the mild hematemesis.
Urology was curbsided and thought that his current symptoms can be managed conservatively with pain medications, NSAIDs, and elevation.
If pain worsens, will need to repeat ultrasound and consult urology urgently.
Patient is aware of what to do if his testicular pain worsens.
History of recurrent MRSA abscesses on buttocks.
Patient should continue to have wound care.
