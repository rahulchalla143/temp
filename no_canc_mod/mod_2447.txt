Admission Date:  [**2137-5-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-5-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2100-7-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**] Chief Complaint: Fatigue, dyspnea, epigastric pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central line placement and removal   History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname 14637**] is a 36-year-old male with HIV (CD4: 627, VL:  2,880 copies/ml in [**4-/2137**]) not on HAART who presented on [**5-8**] with worsening SOB and fatigue.
An in-house TTE revealed EF 10-15%, prompting transfer to the CCU in setting of increasing respiratory distress.
Initially, he presented with 2 days worsening SOB and fatigue.
Previously, Mr. [**Known lastname 14637**] could usually do [**4-2**] flights of stairs, but on admission experienced SOB after [**1-31**] flights.
Shortness of breath was worse with lying down, better with belching, but also with associated chest pressure.
He had no cough, fevers or wheezing.
On [**5-7**], Mr [**Known lastname 14637**] awoke with sharp, squeezing epigastric pain that improved with standing up.
He took Pepcid at 2am but did not feel better, and noted right upper quadrant abdominal discomfort as well, which was worse with movement, unchanged with eating.
At that time, he did not experience any dysphagia, cough, hemoptysis, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, rashes or lesions.
He denies any illicit drugs since that time and claims not to use any cocaine ever.
He is unaware of having been infected by any opportunistic infections.
Epigastric pain prompted presentation to the ED.
Admission CXR with pronounced cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema or infiltrate.
Bedside cardiac ultrasound with ?global hypokinesis and no pericardial effusion or tamponade.
EKG was notable for LAE, nl axis, ischemic changes.
Abnormal LFTs prompted imaging studies and surgical consult.
However [**5-8**] morning, patient had a temperature of 103.8F with associated rigors and tachypnea with RR 30s-40s, 98% RA.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion; patient is currently without chest pain, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

MICRO: [**5-8**] Blood Culture x2: No Growth.
[**2137-5-9**] BLOOD/FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED.
BLOOD/AFB CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO MYCOBACTERIA ISOLATED.
Alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha streptococcus or Lactobacillus sp.
[**5-8**] TOXOPLASMA IgG ANTIBODY: NEGATIVE FOR TOXOPLASMA IgG ANTIBODY BY EIA.
Reference Range:  No antibody detected.
[**5-13**] HCV Genotype pending .
Imaging: - ECHO: IMPRESSION: Severely dilated and hypokinetic right and left ventricles.
This appearance could be a normal variant or due to ventricular non-compaction.
There is moderate tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, likely due to annular dilatation.
No vegetation is seen on this study.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, though unchanged, possibly reflecting cardiomegaly or a pericardial effusion.
There is no focal consolidation, right pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
Severe gallbladder wall edema and tenderness without stones or frank gallbladder distention.
Differential diagnosis includes diffuse edema from acute hepatitis, HIV cholangiopathy, cardiac failure, or systemic hypoproteinemia vs acalculous cholecystitis in the appropriate clinical setting.
Recommend clinical correlation and consider HIDA scan for further evaluation.
Mild splenomegaly.
Minimal perihepatic and perisplenic free fluid.
Mildly distended small bowel with air in distal colon, likely reactive ileus, though early partial small-bowel obstruction cannot be excluded.
No radiopaque stones.
Other Investigations - ECG: NSR, nl axis, nl interval, LAE, borderline QT prolongation, no ST changes, no abnl TWI .
LABS ON DISCHARGE ([**5-14**]): 136  102  19 ------------< 115 4.5  27  1.0  Ca: 9.0 Mg: 1.9 P: 4.3 ALT: 675 AP: 129 Tbili: 0.4 AST: 327  CBC: MCV 85 5.3 > 13.6< 281       40.1  Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 14637**] is a 36 yo male with history of HIV last CD4: 627, VL: 2,880 copies/ml who presented with epigastric dyscomfort and recent onset DOE and was found to have previously unknown dilated cardiomyopathy with EF ~10% in setting of febrile illness.
# Dilated cardiomyopathy: Patient had no known history of heart disease and presented with 3 days of progressive dyspnea on exertion, PND and orthopnea.
In this patient, it was felt the most likely etiology was infecious vs. toxic (though HIV is correlated with premature CAD, patient was without evidence on EKG of prior ischemic insult & on this admission biomarkers were negative; also CD4 count and relatively low VL argued against this primary etiology).
It was felt there was likely a chronic component to the patient's dCMP given the extent of dysfunction and most likely was toxin mediated [**1-30**] his extensive history of crystal meth use.
His presentation this admission may have been related to an acute exacerbation in the setting of a viral infection.
He was transferred to the CCU from the floor due to worsened respiratory distress.
SvO2 was initially 73 and then on repeat in the 60s, suggestive of cardiogenic shock.
He showed evidence of volume overload with elevated JVP and CVP~20 and was initially diuresed with lasix gtt, then bolus doses, and then auto-diuresed with improvement in his oxygenation.
He did not require invasive or non-invasive ventilation.
# Fever: Patient with subjective fevers prior to admission and spiked to 103.8 on morning of transfer to the CCU with associated rigors and diaphoresis.
His CBC was notable for WBC wnl and no left shift; he had no localized complaints.
He underwent TTE as above w/o visible vegetations.
Blood cultures were negative with the exception of one culture from [**5-9**] which grew GPCs in clusters felt to be Peptostrep; this was felt to be a contaminant as all other cultures were negative.
This workup was significant for a positive HCV viral load of about 14,000 in the setting of a negative IgG antibody.
His fever was attributed to a viral syndrome and resolved without further intervention.
# Transaminitis: Per patient with no h/o liver disease though Hep C + on admission testing.
He was seen by hepatology who felt that his elevation in LFTs was attributed to ischemic hepatopathy in setting of congestion and liver hypoperfusion/shocked liver.
His hepatitis C was not felt to be an acute infection (see below).
He did not show signs of synthetic dysfunction during this hospitalization.
# Hepatitis C. HCV VL positive at 14,100, but Ab negative.
Was seen by hepatology who did not feel that this was an acute infection, stating that it not uncommon for patients to have a negative Ab in the setting of co-infection.
# Lymphadenopathy.
Patient with diffuse palpable non-tender lymph nodes.
Likely benign diffuse lymphadenopathy of HIV disease- no further imaging was pursued but patient will benefit from close clinical follow up and potential CT torso to assess for pathologic enlargement.
