The patient noted worsening DOE several days prior to admission, increasing secretions, and had increased his daytime O2 requirement from 4LNC to 5LNC.
Of note, the pt is sedentary at baseline [**3-15**] to his syndrome and is on chronic methadone and other pain medications for bone pain associated with the syndrome.
He reports he has had multiple pneumonias in the past, recently admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] ~6 weeks ago with a Pseudomonas VAP.
Has had sinus congestion and tenderness under his eyes over the past week.

Denies chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.

Past Medical History: Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] Syndrome Chronic obstructive/restrictive lung disease  Social History: - Tobacco: active tobacco use ([**5-16**] cigarrettes a day) - Alcohol: denies - Illicits: denies Lives at home with his grandparents and brothers.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 97.6 BP: 142/100 P: 94 R: 17 O2: 98% General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, short neck MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, unable to assess JVP, no LAD Lungs: severely kyphotic/restricted chest wall; ventilated breath sounds CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: contracted with loosened R wrist.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Left lower lobe opacity likely represents pneumonia, less likely atelectasis.
DISCHARGE LABS: [**2129-7-2**] 04:52AM WBC-8.8 RBC-4.12* Hgb-11.0* Hct-33.8* MCV-82 Plt Ct-180 [**2129-7-2**] 04:52AM Gluc-78 UreaN-21* Creat-0.5 Na-138 K-3.6 Cl-96 HCO3-34* [**2129-7-2**] 04:52AM Calcium-9.6 Phos-2.7 Mg-2.1  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 11622**] is a 27 year old man with h/o Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] Syndrome, chronic obstructive/restrictive lung disease on home O2 4LNC, on nighttime vent with trach, admitted with worsening SOB, DOE and increased secretions, found to have LLL opacity on CTA, c/w VAP.
Increased respiratory distress: Patient was assumed to have a ventilator associated pneumonia, given low grade temps during admission, increased shortness of breath, secretions, pleuritic chest pain and leukocytosis with L shift in the setting of a pseudomonal pneumonia several weeks ago.
The CTA performed in the ED was negative for PE and showed a consolidation in the LLL most likely c/w pneumonia.
There was a suggestion of chronic atelectasis in that portion of the lung on a read from an old CT from [**Hospital1 2025**], however not having seen that scan, and given the severity of Mr. [**Known lastname 86060**] underlying lung disease and lack of any pulmonary reserve, we chose to initiate treatment.
Of note, chest CT did suggest some component of pulmonary edema as contributing to the new respiratory difficulties.
Over the course of several days in the ICU, the patients respiratory status stabilized and prior to d/c he felt his breathing was significantly better and approaching baseline.
Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] Syndrome: Rare connective tissue disorder and osteolytic syndrome, with characteristic facies, skull deformities, osteoporosis, joint laxity, short stature, dissolution of distal phalanges.
Pt has considerable bone pain as a result.
