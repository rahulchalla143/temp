History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 28082**] is a previously healthy 23-year old woman who was hit by a drunk driver in [**State 531**] and sustained massive traumatic brain injuries in [**2155-12-29**], s/p craniectomy, cranioplasty, and VP shunt, who currently presents from [**Hospital3 **] with fever.
Per her parents, on [**2156-8-22**] she had a low grade temperature of 100.0.
On [**2156-8-25**]  she had two episodes of nonbloody emesis, and she started to have a dry, nonproductive cough.
Ms. [**Known lastname 85111**] parents also noted that the she had diaphoresis and increased movements.
On [**2156-8-26**] they noticed that her left eye, which has a keratograft and tarsorrhaphy, became red and injected, with a small amount of purulent yellow drainage.
Per her parents, she has had eye infections multiple times but they have resolved with drops.
During the last week, her rehab reports that she has been arching her back with head turning to the left, has had increasing tone in LUE and lower extremities, with flexion of the right arm.
At rehab on [**2156-8-28**], she had a temperature of 101, and she may hvae had abdominal tenderness per physician's exam (she grimaced with abdominal exam).
Preliminary read of the CT scan of her head (which was done with and without contrast at the request of neurosurgery) did not show any clear focus of infection in her head and was overall not significantly changed from prior.
Her UA was relatively unremarkable and a CXR appeared to have no evidence of a PNA although it was somewhat nondiagnostic.
They feel it is very unlikely that the cause of her fever is her IC shunt given that she has had it for the better part of a year, however if her workup remains negative they could consider tapping it.
Parents confirm no diarrhea and no other mental status changes.
