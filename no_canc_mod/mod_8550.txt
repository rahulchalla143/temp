Admission Date:  [**2131-1-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2131-1-13**]  Date of Birth:   [**2060-1-23**]       Sex:  F  Service:  [**Doctor Last Name **] Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70 year old female with a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid rate that was refractory to medical therapy, that was ablated and had a pacemaker placed.
History of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of esophageal cancer, status post esophagectomy and history of left breast cancer, status post mastectomy was recently discharged from [**Hospital3 **] after pacemaker placement to the [**Hospital6 32395**] Home on [**2131-1-6**].
She did well there but then one day prior to admission developed nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
The vomiting was bilious without blood or coffee grounds.
She had a slightly low blood pressure of 80/50 and was slightly short of breath with an oxygen saturation of 93% on 2 liters and so was brought to the Emergency Room.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home oxygen and metered dose inhalers.
Chronic pulmonary nodules, question pulmonary hypertension versus chronic pulmonary embolism never been diagnosed.
Diastolic dysfunction.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid rate, status post atrioventricular junction ablation, and pacemaker placement in [**2130-12-9**].
Echocardiogram at an outside hospital per report showed [**Hospital1 **]-atrial dilatation, trace mitral regurgitation and an ejection fraction of 33%.
Esophageal cancer, status post resection and chemotherapy.
Status post right ankle fusion for fracture.
Her lungs had coarse sounds with bilateral crackles at the bases.
Heart was regular with no murmurs.
Her abdomen was soft with well healed scars and no hepatosplenomegaly.
She had 1 to 2+ pitting edema bilaterally.
She ruled out for myocardial infarction.
Chest x-ray revealed a pacemaker and question of a left retrocardiac density, collapse versus consolidation as well as perhaps mild pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was diagnosed with hypotension secondary to hypovolemia.
She was found to be guaiac positive in the Emergency Room.
The differential included Clostridium difficile versus gastroenteritis.
After the 2 units her hematocrit stabilized and she had no further decrease.
Her respiratory status improved with diuresis and a steroid taper for presumed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare as she was quite wheezy during admission.
She remained afebrile and her rhythm remained paced.
She had had a number of aspiration events in the past and so a video swallow was obtained which revealed a mild to moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia complicated by reduced bolus control with formation that resulted in aspiration of thin liquids.
She was upgraded to a thin liquid, ground solid diet with her pills whole or crushed in purees and aspiration precautions including tucking chin to chest for all bites and sips, alternating between solids and liquids and clearing the throat and swallowing during the middle and end of the meal.
From the standpoint of her congestive heart failure exacerbation she diuresed well with Lasix.
From the standpoint of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, she improved with nebulizers around the clock and steroid taper.
Her esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed diffuse gastritis and a pulsating extrinsic bulge in the esophagus, suggestive of a thoracic aortic aneurysm.
The cause of her guaiac positive stool was found on colonoscopy which revealed two solitary rectal ulcers with no acute bleeding.
Given that she was on anticoagulation only for atrial fibrillation, they recommended holding anticoagulation until they saw and after the results of the biopsy determine if she needs a repeat endoscopy.
They also recommended a computerized tomographic angiogram of the chest to evaluate for thoracic aortic aneurysm.
She received this examination which revealed no evidence of aortic aneurysm or dissection, although she had diffuse aortic atherosclerotic disease.
It was consistent with her diagnosis of congestive heart failure as she had pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.
Incidental note was made of an avid area of arterial enhancement within the caudate lobe of the liver which most likely was a vascular shunt.
The recommendation per Radiology was that further evaluation with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging scan on a nonemergent basis is recommended if clinically warranted.
She has no clinical symptoms or concerns for such a finding.
Given her stable hematocrit and finding for the source of the bleeding, she was prepared for discharge.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with exacerbation 2.
Congestive heart failure exacerbation secondary to diastolic dysfunction 3.
Atrial fibrillation, status post pacemaker placement 4.
History of left breast cancer 7.
History of esophageal cancer 8.
You will also need an ultrasound of liver if clinically warranted.
