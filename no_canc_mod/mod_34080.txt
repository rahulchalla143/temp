History of Present Illness: This is a 52 year old female with h/o HTN, DM, hypothyroidism, RA, Sjogren's, vasculitis, recent lumbar surgery, presents from an OSH after a fall with hypotension and fever.
Following surgery, she developed hypotension and renal failure and was found to have adrenal insufficiency.
She was discharged on a prednisone taper which was scheduled for completion on [**3-16**].
Per report, today the patient had an unwitnessed syncopal event, however there is no documentation of this.
Tender along lower abdomen.
When she was rolled over, large amount of frank pus from spinal surgical incision--mild amount of erythema with 1cm opening draining pus.
Ordered for CT abd/pelvis to evaluate abdominal tenderness en route to MICU.
On arrival to the floor, the patient is very somnolent and unable to answer most questions.
She does admit to having some pain in her back and feeling fatigued.
Past Medical History: Past Medical History: -Diabetes Mellitus (DMII)- diet controlled, however has been on levemir and novolog sliding scale since hospital discharge given hyperglycemia on steroids -HTN -OA -Hypothyroidism [**1-3**] hashimoto's thyroiditis -RA -Autoimmune vasculitis -fibromyalgia -sjogren's -Post-herpetic neuropathy -h/o chronic back pain s/p multiple back surgeries  Past Surgical History: -s/p tonsillectomy -TMJ surgery -Wisdom teeth extraction -Mediastinoscopy -Thyroid lobectomy -lumbar laminectomy with fusion  Social History: Positive for alcohol and tobacco use.
Married with no children.
Heart: tachy, regular, no murmur appreciated.
Abdomen: obese, soft, +BS, tender to palpation diffusely, most severe with voluntary guarding in the RLQ.
Extrem/Skin: warm and well-perfused, 2+ pedal pulses, no LE edema Back: 7cm lower spinal incision with staples in place, 2in patch of erythema surrounding incision for the length of the wound with approximately 1in of induration along the left edge of the incision, ~3cm area of fluctuance near the superior edge of the incision, tiny amount of thin purulent fluid could be expressed from incision Neuro: A+O to name, moving all four extremities but unable to cooperate with full neuro exam  On discharge: Tmax 100.1 Vital signs stable.
No evidence of hardware failure at the L3-S1 spinal fusion.
No intra-abdominal abscess.
5-mm nodule in the right lower lobe.
CT head [**2157-3-23**]: No acute intracranial pathology.
No abscess or abnormal enhancement seen from T12 to L2.
Large left-sided fluid collection within the subcutaneous fat at L3 and L4 level extending to the left side of the iliac crest which by the MRI appearances alone does not appear like an abscess, but clinical correlation is recommended to exclude superimposed infection.
Cardiac Echo:  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 52 year old female with history of HTN, DM, hypothyroidism, RA, Sjogren's, vasculitis, recent L3-S1 laminectomy/foraminotomy admitted from OSH after fall with fever and hypotension.
## Sepsis/Wound infection: Initial presentation consistent with septic shock, but now off pressors, HD stable and lactate down trending.
Likely source is infection at spine wound seeding blood stream since both are growing Coagulase positive Staph.
TTE negative for vegetations and no peripheral manifestations of endocarditis, including Osler nodes, [**Doctor Last Name **] spots or Janeways.
Patient went to the OR [**3-29**] for wound washout.
No spinal abscess or abnormal enhancement from T12 to L2.
Repeat Stool culture for C. diff if diarrhea/loose stools persist loose stools.
Check Blood cultures x2 if fever spikes ( 101.5) 3.
# Lung nodule: An incidental finding of a 5-mm nodule in the right lower lobe of the lung was noted on CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.
# Fibromyalgia/Chronic pain: On admission, her pain meds, elavil, and neurontin were initially held for altered mental status.
Random cortisol 49, so clearly no longer insufficient.
Heparin Flush 10 unit/mL Kit Sig: One (1) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 8641**] Healthcare, NH  Discharge Diagnosis: Lumbar wound infection   Discharge Condition: Neurologically stable   Discharge Instructions: ??????
Keep your wound dry while you have a wound Vac in place, you may not shower and get the area wet, but may sponge bath the area ??????
No pulling up, lifting more than 10 lbs., or excessive bending or twisting.
Pain that is continually increasing or not relieved by pain medicine.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, and drainage.
Any change in your bowel or bladder habits (such as loss of bowl or urine control).
