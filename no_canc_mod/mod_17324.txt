Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 73931**] Admission Date: [**2150-8-4**] Discharge Date: [**2150-8-4**] Date of Birth:  [**2150-8-4**] Sex:  F Service:  Neonatology   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 32-and-[**2-11**]-week infant girl with a left-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia and unilateral cleft lip and palate admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for stabilization.
This preemie infant was born to a 20-year-old gravida 2, para 1 woman with A+ blood type, antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, rubella immune, EDC of [**2150-9-27**], and gonorrhea and chlamydia negative.
The most recent MRI on [**2150-7-20**] showed a left-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia     with a moderate amount of liver and a large fluid-filled     loop of bowel.
This loop of bowel was possibly the     stomach or a more distal loop that was trapped.
The left     upper lobe of the lung was easily seen, suggesting that     the congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a "sac-type"     hernia.
Sinus fetal bradycardia with an echocardiogram on [**7-20**], showing trivial mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid     regurgitation, mild aortic arch hypoplasia, a left aortic     arch, and secondary dextrocardia.
Sinus bradycardia with a heart rate     of 95 to 100 was noted and appeared to be     atrioventricular synchrony.
Unilateral cleft lip and palate.
Mild to moderate bilateral hydronephrosis with normal     bladder size.
Fetal course also significant for polyhydramnios with an     amniotic fluid index of 40.
This was thought to be     related to the dilated bowel loop that might be     obstructed.
Due to an amnion/chorion separation and the mother's high     risk for rupture of membranes with rapid delivery, Ms.     [**Known lastname 26581**] had been monitored on bedrest at [**Hospital1 29402**] since [**2150-7-27**].
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 37079**] was placed, and 30 mL of bilious fluid were removed.
With maternal temp.
to 100.3, unknown Group B Strep, and rupture of membranes on [**2150-7-30**] at 2230, the mother did receive intrapartum antibiotics.
The infant was active, severe respiratory distress, pectus notable, anterior fontanelle open and slightly full, unilateral cleft lip and palate, normal S1 and S2, no murmur, breath sounds fair on the right side, bowel sounds appreciated on the left side of the chest, abdomen slightly scaphoid, extremities with fair perfusion, hips stable, spine intact, anus patent, skin easily sloughed, superficial abrasion on the right hand, and some bruising throughout.
Chest x-ray showed some evidence of lung tissue in the     lung tissue in the left upper lobe.
It was difficult to assess lung     tissue in the right lung due to heart shifting.
There was bowel gas noted in the     left upper chest and no bowel noted.
Repeat venous gas after this     change showed a pH of 7.33, CO2 of 47, and base excess of -1     The amplitude was then decreased to 27.
Our     recommendations are to continue surfactant doses as needed     as well as monitoring gases closely.
Cardiovascular: The infant did have an initial low blood     pressure and required 1 normal saline bolus with follow-up     blood pressures that were normal.
Pre-and postductal sats.
The infant had an initial CBC with a     white count of 10.5, 50 neutrophils, 0 bands, 36 lymphs,     a crit of 38%, and a normal platelet count.
Left-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia.
Unilateral cleft lip and palate.
