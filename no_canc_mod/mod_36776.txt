Iatrogenic bile duct injury - Underwent interval laparoscopic, converted to open cholecystectomy on [**4-3**]; Complicated by iatrogenic CBD injury - Intra-op critical view was felt to be achieved; intra-op cholangiogram did not reveal CBD injury - Converted to open due to adherrent bowel to RUQ - POD1: LFT, Bil noted to be raised + raised Trop T; went into AF with RVR; cardio consult recommended doubling Toprol dose - MRCP done in view of rising Bil: non-filling CBD ; PTC placed; initally drained bile but now blood - Transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further cardiac evaluation and management of CBD injury  2.
CAD - No acute intervention for NSTEMI, left circumflex stenting in [**1-21**] - Cardiac cath [**2-18**] shoed thrombosed left circumflex stent, unable to recannulate - Noted to have stress-induced AFib and demand ischemia but did not require further investigation  Past Medical History: PMHX 1.
CAD s/p left circumflex stenting with recent myocardial infarction [**1-21**] - Cardiac cath [**2-18**] showed thrombosed left circumflex which cannot be recannulated  2.
Diverticulosis  3.
Atrial fibrillation  5.
Asthma  6.
Cholecystitis, cholangitis, history of gallstone pancreatitis  Past Sx Hx: 1.
Lap converted open cholecystectomy [**65**]/04/11 c/b iatrogenic CBD injury   Social History: Married  Family History: No CAD, otherwise N/C  Physical Exam: Vitals: T 101.6; HR 83; BP 139/75; RR 24; POx 94% 4LNC GEN: A&O, NAD, mild to moderate jaundice, tired appearing HEENT: mucus membranes moist, no LAD, OP clear CV: RRR, II/VI SEM PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, distended, appropriately TTP, no rebound or guarding, normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses.
PTC to gravity draining brown bilious fluid, JP to bulb suction in RUQ with sero-sanguinous drainage INCISION: C/D/I, staples to mid-abdominal wound EXT: No LE edema, LE warm and well perfused, 2+ DP/PT pulses .
Imaging: - [**3-28**] CXR ([**Last Name (un) 1724**]): The chest is normal except for healed rib fractures on the right.
There is no interval change - [**4-3**] Intra-Op Cholangiogram ([**Last Name (un) 1724**]): Opacification of the intrahepatic biliary ductal system, probably both right and left intrahepatic ducts, as well as dilation of a tubular structure more inferiorly that was initially read as the common bile duct.
Further review indicates that in addition to the common bile duct, this also could be a dilated left intrahepatic duct projecting inferiorly due to obliquity - [**4-4**] MRCP ([**Last Name (un) 1724**]): Common hepatic duct and proximal CBD not seen and there is dilatation of the left greater than right intrahepatic biliary ductal system, with postsurgical inflammatory changes within the operative bed as well as perihepatic fluid.
- [**4-5**] EKG:  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, Nonspecific ST abnormality, ST less depressed in Anterior leads - [**4-6**] ERCP ([**Last Name (un) 1724**]): The ampulla was identified and had evidence of previous sphincterotomy.
There is abrubt cut-off of the proximal CBD consistent with bile duct injury.
Brief Hospital Course: 75M with a recent hx of cholecystitis and cholangitis ([**1-/2152**]), managed medically due to concurrent NSTEMI w/trop >84 underwent an interval laparoscopic converted to open cholecystectomy on [**4-3**], which was complicated by an iatrogenic CBD transection and cardiac enzyme elevation.
The patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further cardiac evaluation and management of his bile duct injury.
Cardiology assessment recommended an alternative Toprol dose but otherwise recommended no further cardiac opitimization for surgery.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled which revealed no rising troponin levels.
After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and a dilaudid PCA for pain control.
Neuro: The patient received a dilaudid PCA with good effect and adequate pain control.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
The patient's wound was monitored for possible signs of infection.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
7. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain for 2 weeks.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: bile duct injury afib h/o cad   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 670**] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] if you have any of the following: fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, increased abdominal pain or distension, constipation/diarrhea, incision redness/bleeding/drainage or capped "roux tube" insertion site appears red or has drainage.
Empty JP drain and record outputs.
(Disregard if drain removed prior to discharge to home) You may shower with soap/water, pat incision dry.
