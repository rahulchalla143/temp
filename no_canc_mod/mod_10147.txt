Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 86 y/o M w/ with hx of DMII, chronic UTI, PVD, hyperthyroidsm on methimazole, resident of Tower [**Doctor Last Name **] skilled nursing facility, who presents with one day of generalized weakness and malaise  # Bladder perforation/peritonitis - On hospital day 3, the pt began to complain of [**11-10**] LLQ pain that was not relieved with IV morphine.
On examination, the pt was found to have a rigid abdomen with peritoneal signs.
Surgery was consulted and a stat CT abd/pelvis with contrast was significant for bladder perforation.
A CT cystogram confirmed these findings and the patient was taken emergently to the OR by urology for exlap with closure of the bladder over a portion of the peritoneum with a placement of a JP drain.
He became transiently hypotensive during the case and required the initiation of neosynephrine gtt to maintain SBPs > 100.
# UTI - [**Month (only) 116**] have contributed to pt's underlying malaise/lethary on admission.
Unfortunately, a urine culture was not sent but blood cultures came back positive for GNR resistant to fluoroquinolones.
Subsequently, the pt did not have any fevers and WBC trended down.
# malaise/lethargy - [**Month (only) 116**] have been secondary to underlying infection with UTI.
Hypothyroidism [**3-4**] oversuppression with methimazole was considered and a TSH was checked that was wnl.
EKG was without ischemic changes.
CXR was negative for pneumonia.
# DMII controlled with complications - Continued NPH and covered with insulin sliding scale.
# Hyperthyroidsm - Worsened on amiodorone tx (now off), on methimazole, followed by endocrine as outpatient.
# A-fib - Continued on bisoprolol.
# PVD - Continued pentoxyfiline.
Discharge Instructions: -You may shower 2 days after surgery, but do not tub bathe, swim, soak, or scrub incision for 2 weeks.
