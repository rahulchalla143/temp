Small bilateral pleural effusions and subsegmental atelectasis in the lower left lung are again demonstrated.
Compared with the previous study, volume loss in the left lung has probably improved.
The very small left apical pneumothorax is no longer apparent.
IMPRESSION: Interval improvement and volume loss in the left lung.
A left apical pneumothorax is no longer apparent.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:      N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions PREBYPASS No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
