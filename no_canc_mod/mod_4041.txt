Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 83 year-old male with hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus (diet-controlled), and renal carcinoma s/p right partial nephrectomy in [**2111**] presenting with new atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and cough/dyspnea.
The patient's symptoms initially were thought to be multifactorial with bronchitis (given quality of cough and upper airway wheezing without fever or leukocytosis), COPD (given extensive smoking history and history of prior cough), and diastolic heart failure due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
Pneumonia was also considered initially given LLL rales.
The patient was started on azithromycin/ ceftriaxone/ and vancomycin (given + blood culture on day of admission) for broad coverage.
On [**2-5**], the patient was found to have acute worsening of respiratory status with tachypnea, significant wheezing, and desaturations to 80%'s despite being on a non-rebreather.
Brief MICU course: Upon arrival to the ICU, echo results returned showing moderate LV systolic dysfunction with severe inferolateral hypokinesis and EF 30-35% (EF 55% in [**2110**]), 4+ mitral regurgitation, elevated right-sided pressures, and mild LVH.
A moderate sized echodense pericardial effusion was noted, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements, with no evidence of tamponade.
The patient underwent diagnostic L thoracentesis, which showed transudative properties with cultures and cytology negative.
Remainder of hospital course is by problem, as follows:  # Cough/ SOB: As above, the patient was initially started on antibiotics to cover for a possible bronchitis/ pneumonia.
He completed a course of prednisone x 3 days and was started on Advair with prn levalbuterol and ipratropium nebulizers for potential COPD component.
The patient was screened for tuberculosis with negative AFB smears x 3.
Bilateral LENIs were negative for DVTs.
Once echo results returned, SOB and cough were felt to be most likely cardiac in origin with acute systolic and diastolic dysfunction and decompensated valvular disease contributing.
The  patient was effectively diuresed approximately >6 L over his hospital course with resolution of symptoms and no further oxygen requirement.
# CAD: The patient had no known CAD on admission.
There was no evidence of MI with negative cardiac biomarkers x 3 and no ST-T wave changes suggestive of ischemia.
On [**2-12**] catheterization, the patient was found to have evidence of 1 vessel disease in the RCA as well as diffuse plaquing.
# Rhythm: The patient presented with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation on this admission.
Etiology was felt to be due to severe systolic as well as diastolic dysfunction and decompensated valvular disease.
The patient was started on several agents for HR control, which were uptitrated to the following regimen with HR in mostly 60s-70s: metoprolol XL 300 mg daily, diltiazem SR 120 mg daily (added for rate control despite the severe LV systolic heart failure), and digoxin (therapeutic at 0.9 on discharge).
He was continued on a heparin drip for anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation; however, upon discharge decision was made not to pursue Coumadin therapy as patient was felt to be a poor candidate due to history of medication noncompliance.
# Congestive heart failure, acute, systolic and diastolic, EF 25%: As mentioned above, the patient was found to have [**3-6**]+ mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, elevated R-sided pressures, and systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral wall and moderate hypokinesis of the remaining segments with EF 35% on [**2-5**] echo.
Cath confirmed severe systolic LV dysfunction (global HK), mild diastolic biventricular dysfunction, 2+ mitral regurgitation, and LVEF 25%.
He was set up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] for further managment of heart failure as an outpatient.
# Hypertension: The patient presented with hypertension to 160s/90s, which improved with diuresis, ACE-I, and uptitration of metoprolol and diltiazem.
# Decompensated Mitral Valve Disease: [**2-5**] echo revealed 4+ mitral regurgitation of unclear etiology.
# Pericardial effusion: The patient presented with an enlarged cardiac silhouette on admission CXR, with 2/4 echo revealing moderate sized effusion with mixed echogenic material.
Effusion was of unclear etiology - inflmammation vs infection vs malignancy vs hemorrhagic.
There were no echocardiographic signs of tamponade, no pulsus paradoxus on exam, and no evidence of tamponade on catheterization.
There was no change in effusion size on serial echos.
Decision was made not to perform pericardiocentesis as effusion seemed stable and the patient was asymptomatic.
# Ophthalomology: The patient was blind in left eye (does not know etiology of this), and right eye had conjunctival injection on admission.
Ophtalmology was consulted, and they recommended to use prednisilone acetate 1% in R eye QD to prevent rejection of corneal implant.
# Renal Cell Carcinoma: The patient has a history of RCC s/p right partial nephrectomy in [**2111**].
The patient is followed by urology as an outpatient with no acute issues.
As above, pleural effusion cytology was negative for malignant cells.
# Hematuria: The patient had brief episode of hematuria upon removal of Foley catheter, likely secondary to Foley trauma.
# DMII: The patient has a history of diet-controlled DM, with recent HbA1c of 5.8%.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.

You had several echocardiograms (ultrasounds of the heart), and a cardiac catheterization which confirmed heart valve disease and poor pumping function of the heart (EF ~25%).
You were started on several new medications for your heart disease, which you should continue to take DAILY as prescribed.
You should continue to weigh yourself daily, if weight increases > 3lbs, you should call your PCP or cardiologist.
If you experience any chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, wheezing, dizziness, swelling in the extremities, or any other concerning symptoms please contact your PCP or go to the ER for further evaluation.
