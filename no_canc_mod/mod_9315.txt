His postoperative course was notable for atrial fibrillation as well as slow progression of cardiac rehabilitation.
The patient was ultimately transferred to rehabilitation facility to assess with pulmonary toilette, however, it was noted that he began having increasing respiratory difficulty with poor pulmonary toilette at the rehabilitation facility and the patient was admitted to the Emergency Department here at [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2181-8-28**], due to severe respiratory distress.
Stable angina until recent increase in symptoms at which time he had a positive exercise tolerance test.
Carotid artery disease, status post left carotid endarterectomy in [**2178**].
Spinal stenosis, status post back surgery times two.
Peripheral neuropathy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was noted to have coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
Chest x-ray on admission to the hospital revealed congestive heart failure with a probable pneumonia.
The patient received a cardiology consultation on hospital day two, [**2181-8-29**], due to persistent atrial fibrillation.
The patient had also had an episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia precipitating the cardiology consultation.
Pulmonary medicine consultation was also obtained on [**2181-8-29**], due to assistance in management for respiratory distress and pneumonia versus acute respiratory distress syndrome.
It was their assessment that the patient was a 66 year old male status post coronary artery bypass graft who was readmitted with respiratory distress, fever and hypoxia, likely from pulmonary edema as well as nosocomial pneumonia.
The patient also had mediastinal fluid aspirated due to question of instability of his sternal wound.
The patient was maintained in the Intensive Care Unit on mechanical ventilatory support, covered with broad spectrum antibiotics, followed by the pulmonary medicine service as well as the infectious disease service.
The patient had persistent problems with fever and elevated white blood cell count although the only cultures which had come back positive were that of an arterial line tip as well as one positive blood culture which was positive for Staphylococcus.
The patient was eventually heparinized due to intermittent bouts with atrial fibrillation and this was ultimately converted to Coumadin for long term anticoagulation due to atrial fibrillation.
The patient also during his first week had lower extremity noninvasive studies to rule out deep vein thrombosis and these studies were negative.
Despite multiple cultures, no fever source was ultimately identified.
On [**2181-9-6**], through [**2181-9-7**], the patient was noted to have a maculopapular rash over his trunk, his back and his thigh with persistent fever.
Both the fever and the rash ultimately did resolve without specific intervention.
During this course of hospitalization, the patient also had some difficulty with loose stools, however, multiple specimens for C. difficile were sent and have been returned as negative.
He was on intravenous Heparin drip for anticoagulation due to his intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation.
On [**2181-9-14**], the patient had some episodes of anxiety, questionable agitation, despite occasional doses of Ativan, Morphine and Haldol which were being dosed as needed.
His pneumonia also appeared to be resolving and clinically he had been improving.
It was their recommendation to hold off on any antibiotic administration unless the patient spiked a very high fever or unless there was an identifiable bacteria which required treatment.
The patient continued in the Intensive Care Unit over the next few days with slow weaning of the pressure support.
The patient's condition today, [**2181-9-19**], is as follows:  The patient is afebrile with a temperature of 99.
The patient's blood pressure is stable at 143/58, heart rate 58 and sinus bradycardia.
There is slight tenderness at the site of the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement.
Adult respiratory distress syndrome.
