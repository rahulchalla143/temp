Admission Date:  [**2169-11-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-11-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2106-5-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Naproxen / Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Doxycycline  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7223**] Chief Complaint: Ventricular tachycardia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Ventricular tachycardia ablation procedure and dual chamber ICD(defibrillator) implantation.
History of Present Illness: This is a 63 year old Pakistani male with hx type  IDDM, HTN, remote 70 pack year smoking history, CAD s/p MI and 4v CABG in 99, s/p cath and stent in [**2163**] anatomy unknown, who presented to an OSH with palpitations.
He decreased his lopressor dose at that time, and his palpitations temporarily resolved.
He then reports that 1 week ago, he began to have worsening shortness of breath, orthopnea, and LE edema.
His dyspnea was mostly on exertion, and he reports becoming windy after "several step."
This is far from his baseline exercise tolerance, which is "several blocks of walking."
1 day prior to admission, at around 2 pm, he began to have palpitations.
He reports that these palpitations are similar to the palpitations that he had previously 1 month ago.
He also notes that he began to have shortness of breath and also reports feeling weak, tired, lightheaded and felt as though a "curtain was going down in his field of vision."
At the OSH, he was found to have EKG c/w ventricular tachycardia and was started on an amiodarone drip 150 mg bolus amio over 20 mins followed by 1 mg/min gtt.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Past Medical History: Cardiac Risk Factors: Diabetes,  Hypertension .
Adenosquamous carcinoma s/p ?
?left upper lobe lobectomy .
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Physical Exam: VS: Afebrile, BP 129/99 , HR 94 , 12 RR , O2 98% on 2L Gen: WDWN middle aged male mildly diaphoretic, no resp distress Oriented x3.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Decreased breath sounds on right lower base, bibasilar crackles.
Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 1+ DP  Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 1+ DP  MEDICAL DECISION MAKING  Pertinent Results: EKG demonstrated paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia, RAD .
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed in [**2167**] demonstrated: 40-45% mild LV enlargement and area of focal akinesis in inferior wall and LV apex  Brief Hospital Course: 63 yo male with CAD s/p 4v CABG in [**2161**] and sytolic HF, EF now 25-30% who presents with a paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia.
Ventricular Tachycardia:  He has a ventricular arrhythmia with underlying structural heart disease, CAD with EF 25-30%.
There were no events on tele between the ablation and the ICD placement.
On [**11-6**] he had a ECHO which showed LVEF 30% and increased wedge pressure.
He remained hemodynamically stable, and without evidence of end organ ischemia.
Acute systolic heart failure: Appeared mildly fluid overloaded admission, resolved with PRN lasix.
On echo here, he was found to have sytolic dysfunction with EF 25-30%, which is reduced from his previous EF of 40-45% in [**2167**].
CHF at this time may be due to ischemia or secondary to arrythmia.
Cardiac markers negative for MI, but trace positive, probably due to demand ischemia.
CKD: Acute on chronic renal failure on admission.
CKD likely secondary to DMII and HTN.
acute KD likely pre-renal secondary to poor renal perfusion in the setting of frequent VTs.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSES: Ventricular tachycardia Sinus bradycardia Acute renal failure Congestive heart failure Hypermagnesemia .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES: Diabetes mellitus HTN Chronic renal insufficiency   Discharge Condition: stable, ambulating   Discharge Instructions: You were diagnosed with a ventricular tachycardia.
You underwent an ablation procedure and subsequent ICD(defibrillator) and pacemaker placement without complications.
Please take note that we increased your pravastatin to 80mg because of your elevated cholesterol levels.
Please return to the hospital or see your PCP if you have any chest pain, shortness of breath, fever or pain in the insertion site of your ICD/pacemaker.
You had an abnormal finding on your chest x-ray for which you should follow with him.
