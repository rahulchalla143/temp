Small foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage are seen in the left temporal lobe.
Minimally displaced fracture line is seen extending across the left temporal bone involving the mastoid air cells.
There is also a nondisplaced serpiginous fracture involving the inferior and medial orbital walls on the left.
There is subcutaneous emphysema on the left.
Opacification of multiple left-sided mastoid air cells with air-fluid levels is seen.
There may be a minimal amount of blood in the left subdural space along the convexity.
There is no shift of midline structures.
Soft tissue swelling is seen over the left occipital region.
Foci of pneumocephalus are seen on the right (series 2, image 13).
Nondisplaced fractures of the left medial and inferior orbital wall.
Minimally displaced fracture of the left temporal bone across the mastoid air cells.
Small foci of right-sided pneumocephalus.
Left-sided subcutaneous emphysema.
Small foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left temporal region, and likely a sliver of subdural bleeding on the left, which does not cause midline shift.
The main pulmonary artery is slightly enlarged (3.2 cm).
There are patchy consolidative opacities in the left lower lobe as well as more symmetric consolidative opacities in both lower lobes posteriorly, some of which have a nodular component.
In addition there is a right middle lobe nodular opacity measuring 3mm.
No pleural effusions are seen.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: On the delayed images the hepatic parenchyma appears homogeneous without evidence of injury.
Although there is streak artifact through the spleen, there is a linear hypodensity seen which is concerning for a laceration posteriorly.
There is high- density fluid tracking along both pericolic gutters and into the pelvis, a moderate amount; no sentinal clot is seen.
The loops of small and large bowel appear normal in caliber.
A 7 mm rounded hypodensity as well as a 5 mm rounded hypodensity in the right kidney are incompletely evaluated.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.
There is no free intra-abdominal air.
Prostate and seminal vesicles as well as the rectum appear unremarkable.
Moderate amount of high density fluid consistent with blood within the abdomen.
Findingd in spleen,although suboptimally evalurated are concerning for a laceration 2.
Patchy opacity in the left lower lobe could represent developing contusion.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
Pulmonary nodule for which one year follow up is recommended to ensure stability.
CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIA  Reason: fx  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 23 year old man with facial fx s/p MVC REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: fx CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
Left orbital fracture is seen on head CT.
TECHNIQUE: CT of the facial bones with coronal reformations.
FINDINGS: The nondisplaced fracture involving the posteromedial left orbital wall is again identified.
The fracture of the left temporal bone is better evaluated on the prior CT. No new fractures are identified.
The visualized paranasal sinuses demonstrate mucosal thickening of the sphenoid air cells.
Opacification of multiple left mastoid air cells is again seen.
IMPRESSION: Nondisplaced fracture involving the posteromedial left orbital wall, without evidence of herniation of orbital contents.
Minimally displaced left temporal bone fracture.
No new fracture is identified.
Neurosurgery, Plastics, Opthamology and ENT were all consulted because of his multiple injuires.
Opthomology was consulted to rule out globe entrapment due to the facial fractures, none was identified.
ENT was also consulted to rule out any facial nerve injury, he will need to follow up in 2 weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3878**] for an audiogram.
Occupational therapy was consulted because of his head injury and to assess his cognitive status.
Milk of Magnesia 800 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML's PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p Rollover motor vehicle crash Left temporal/parietal fractures Small intraparenchymal bleed Left orbital fracture Pulmonary contusions   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Return to the Emergency room if you develop any  fevers, chills, headache, visual disturbances, increased shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and/or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1669**] for an appointment; inform the office that you will need a repeat head CT scan for this appointment.
