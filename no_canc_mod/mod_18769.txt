Admission Date:  [**2158-8-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-8-11**]  Date of Birth:  [**2104-3-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Motrin / Chlorhexidine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**] Chief Complaint: hepatic hydrothorax with bloody thoracentesis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2158-8-4**]:  Right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery evacuation of hemothorax, removal of clotted hemothorax, talc pleurodesis.
History of Present Illness: 53 yoM with HCV and ETOH related cirrhosis (Childs Class C) on [**Month/Day/Year **] list complicated by chronic hydrothorax (always on right) requiring thoracentesis throughout past year, ascites, PVT, hepatic encephalopathy, grade 1 varices, and h/o SBP.
There is no history of infection related to the thoracentesis and per patient he has never had talc/pleurodesis.
Over past week his taps have been showing signs of blood and so he was admitted for evaluation by thoracic surgery for possible chest tube placement with talc/pleurodesis.
He has required frequent banding for esophageal varices and has failed TIPs procedure in past.
He was started on Cipro PPX after admission for SBP in 3/[**2157**].
He has recent PNA now s/p azithromycin course with residual cough but SOB, CP, fevers/chills.
In brief, this is a 53yo M PMHx HCV cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy, varices, SBP, portal vein thrombus, ascites w recurrent hepatic hydrothorax, hypervolemic hyponatremia (on tolvaptan), initially presenting after patient had bloody thoracenteses, with patient remaining hemodynamically stable w unchanged Hct; hospital course notable for R chest tube placement and pleurodesis by Thoracic Surgery on hospital day 3; prior to undergoing chest tube placement, patient developed whole body [**Year (4 digits) **], blanching, maculopapular, thought to be allergic reaction to chlorhexadine wash.  Over 12 hours after chest tube placement and pleurodesis, patient had 400cc serosanguinous output; UOP fell overnight to <10cc/hour; HR increased from 70s to 150s, SBPs 130s to 90s, and patient developed new O2 requirement (initially on room air, slowly escalating to 4L then nonrebreather).
CXR did not demonstrate signs of PTX or new infection; given worsening symptoms, patient transferred to MICU for further management.

No echocardiographic evidence of PE, though is not definitive test for evaluation of pulmonary embolism.
[**8-5**] CXR: There is a small right apical pneumothorax.
There has been decreased size of the right small pleural effusion.
There is coarsening of the bronchovascular markings without signs for overt pulmonary edema.
Atelectasis at the right lung base is seen.
There is no pneumothoraces.
There is a right-sided pleural effusion with some loculation along the right chest wall.
There is some atelectasis versus developing infiltrates at the lung bases, which are stable.
[**8-7**] abd US Limited four-quadrant ultrasound of the abdomen demonstrates a trace amount of ascites in the perihepatic and perisplenic regions.
Given the trace ascites and the patient's elevated INR, this was deemed unsafe for a diagnostic/therapeutic paracentesis.
No pneumothorax after chest tube removal.
Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions.
micro [**2158-8-4**] stool neg for O&P CMV viral load negative Pleural fluid and pleural bx negative bacterial, acid fast and fungal cx [**2158-8-5**] blood cx negative .
Pleural fluid cytology: negative for malignant cells .
Pleural bx: Right pleural debris, excision (A): Chronic fibrinous and organizing pleuritis.
Brief Hospital Course: 53yo M PMHx HCV cirrhosis c/b varices, ascites w recurrent hepatic hydrothorax, presented with recent history of blood thoracenteses in liver clinic.
Admitted for eval by thoracics for CP and talc pleurodesis.
Course was complicated by [**Month/Day/Year **] and hypoxia s/p CT placement requiring short stay in MICU.
# Hepatic Hydrothorax: Pt was previously receiving biweekly thoracentesis for management of hepatic hydrothorax but past several taps have come back bloody with hct of pleural fluid ranging from 4 to 13.
Post procedure, course was complicated by pain and hypoxia requiring transfer to MICU (see below).
Pleural fluid analysis was consistent with hepatic hydrothorax and cultures and cytology were negative.
On day prior to discharge, CXR revealed no new effusion indicating successful pleurodesis.
#[**Name (NI) 10540**] - pt transferred to MICU with hypoxia in setting of recent chest tube placement.
PTX, PE and worsening pleural effusion were all ruled out.
Pt was also noted to be overly sedated when he became hypoxic which was most likely [**1-18**] to high dose narcotic administration.
CXR revealed R cardiac border infiltrate and pt's WBC increased to 27K.
In setting of AMS, aspiration pneumonia was diagnosed and pt was started on vancomycin, levaquin and zosyn for broad spectrum coverage.
# Distributive shock - pt w hypotension to SBP 80s, tachycardia, borderline febrile on floor, but afebrile by the time he was transferred to unit.
Blood cultures never speciated but pt met SIRS criteria and had suspected PNA suggesting sepsis as cause of shock.
# [**Name (NI) **] - Pt developed diffuse pruritic morbilliform eruption over extremities and trunk one day after washing with chlorhexadine soap for OR.
Derm evaluated pt and determined that [**Name (NI) **] is drug reaction most likely secondary to systemic antibiotic.
Pt was advised not to take chlorhexadine, and avoid azithromycin.
# Anemia - Secondary to iron deficiency and ACD.
Pt had several crit drops to low 20's but never had any source of acute bleed.
# Cirrhosis - pt w HCV cirrhosis with varices, ascites, prior history of SBP and hepatic encephalopathy.
Chronic and stable on floor with worsening ascites in setting of multiple fluid boluses.
After ICU stay, pt had ileus secondary to narcotics.
He did not experience any episodes of encephalopathy at this point.
# Eosinophilia: h/o peripheral and pleural fluid eosinophilia, uncertain etiology.
Chronic thoracenteses have been documented to cause peripheral eosinophilia with pleural eosinophilia.
Stool was negative for O&P and pt was not on any medication that would be responsible for eosinophilia.
Chronic Hyponatremia: Pt w h/o hyponatremia thought to be [**1-18**] cirrhosis, maintained on tolvaptan, with normal Na levels.
He was discharged on home dose with low Na and fluid restricted diet.

The purpose of this procedure is the scar the lining of your lung against your chest wall to prevent fluid from re-accumulating in that space.
Of note, your hospital course was complicated by pneumonia, increased difficulty breathing, and decreased blood pressures.
We treated your infection and you will not need any more antibiotic treatment.
When you returned from the ICU your abdomen was distended and it was determined that you had an ileus, likely secondary to narcotic medication.
You also developed a skin [**Month (only) **] due to a medication you took.
