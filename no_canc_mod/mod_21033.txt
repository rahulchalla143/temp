Admission Date:  [**2163-5-18**]       Discharge Date: [**2163-5-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2085-9-18**]       Sex:  F  Service:  SICU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred here for inability to wean ventilator.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old female with a history of "severe" COPD with recent upper respiratory tract infection who presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] with a COPD exacerbation and was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure (ABGs 7.26/59/89) and is being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
She was noted to have runs of SVT at 120 beats per minute with inferolateral ST depressions in the setting of agitation and bronchospasms.
Her urine culture was showing more than 100,000 gram-positive cocci which eventually grew out Staphylococcus epidermidis.
She ruled out for a myocardial infarction.
History of SVT or paroxysmal atrial tachycardia.
Spontaneous intramuscular hematoma.
IV started on [**2163-5-18**], likely secondary to urinary culture.
FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of CAD or MI.
No appreciable elevated JVP.
Poor air movement.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Extremities:  No edema, no cyanosis.
Second U/A on [**2163-5-22**] showed 6 white blood cells and less than 1 epithelial, large blood, 9 red blood cells, trace protein, occasional white blood cell clusters.
Electrolytes upon admission revealed a primary metabolic alkalosis and concomitant respiratory acidosis.
She ruled out for myocardial infarction times three.
Cultures at the time of transfer from the SICU to the floor were showing no growth.
She had a head CT without contrast that showed air-fluid levels within the bilateral maxillary sinuses and right sphenoid and ethmoid air cells.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Thought to be secondary to COPD exacerbation.
Hypercarbic on presentation with acute respiratory acidosis.
Shortly after which, she developed hypertension and difficulty breathing so she was passed on BIPAP, given nitroglycerin and 20 mg of IV Lasix which resolved.
METABOLIC ALKALOSIS:  Likely secondary to hyperventilation with respiratory compensation.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Coronary wise, this patient had ST depressions and T wave inversions in the inferolateral leads.
She ruled out for myocardial infarction.
She was not started on a beta blocker given her severe COPD.
Some telemetry strips appeared to be paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
However, the thought that these runs of SVT are likely secondary to her lung disease and thus no anticoagulation is needed at this time.
Additionally, on [**2163-5-20**], she had nine beats of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
URINARY TRACT INFECTION:  She showed more than 100,000 Gram-positive cocci plus positive leukocyte esterase and many white blood cells on the U/A at the outside hospital and thus she was treated with three days of ampicillin.
On the day of transfer to the floor, a repeat U/A showed some white blood cells and some white blood cell clumps and thus she was started on levofloxacin.
LEUKOCYTOSIS/LEFT SHIFT:  Originally thought to be secondary to steroids; however, upon repeat check of the differential this was clearly a bandemia with myelocytes as well indicating a severe left shift.
Thus, she underwent a head CT which revealed evidence of sinusitis and thus she was treated with Bactrim and Augmentin.
with regular insulin sliding scale while on steroids, a proton pump inhibitor, subcutaneous heparin, and pneumatic compression boots.
