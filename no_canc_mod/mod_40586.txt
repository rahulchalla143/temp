Brief Hospital Course: 74 y/o M with history of HTN, Hyperlipidemia, and CAD s/p PCI in [**2074**] who initially presented to OSH on Friday night with severe epigastric burning.
Ruled in for MI with troponins of 1.24 and 2.0. with no EKG changes and was found to have 3VD on cath and was referred for CABG.
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2101-6-30**] where he underwent Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and reverse saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginal artery and the distal circumflex artery.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
He did have some issues with nausea/ vomiting on POD2 and KUB revealed scattered air within non-dilated loops of large and small bowel and no evidence of bowel obstruction.
He was restarted on half his home dose Zestril with SBP100-130 and he was not started on a statin due to a history of rhabdomyolysis with Lipitor.
Chest tubes were removed POD#4 (left in longer due to serous drainage) and CXR showed questionable loculated left pneumothorax.
Follow up lateral decub CXR showed no pneumothorax.
Pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
6. magnesium hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
7. bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
