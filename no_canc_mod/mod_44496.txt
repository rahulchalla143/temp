Admission Date:  [**2140-12-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2140-12-28**]    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 89 year old right-handed man with a history of questionable hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, aortic aneurysm and prostate cancer who was in general good health when he got up and went to the left arm and leg weakness in the bathroom at 07:05.
The patient had an initial improvrment of his symptoms and recovered his deficit  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On arrival, blood pressure 134/80; heart rate 80.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, no bruits.
Extremities with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
No dysarthria.
Mild left nasolabial fold decrease.
Finger-to-nose, heel-to-shin, no ataxia on the right.
No extinction in his visual fields.
MRA shows no flow in the right ICA, right middle cerebral artery, right ACA likely secondary to low flow state.
However, later that same day, six hours after TPA it was noted that he had decreased movement in the left leg.
He was taken emergently for an angiogram that showed a 99% right ICA stenosis.
A follow-up CT scan was obtained to evaluate the abdominal aortic aneurysm which showed that it was stable without dissection, which is the final read.
Vascular Surgery at that point, decided that the patient should not be anti-coagulated on Coumadin long- term prior to repair of the abdominal aortic aneurysm.
He remained somewhat confused because it is likely that his urinary tract infection had not cleared and Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy recommended placement at rehabilitation.
Right internal carotid artery occlusion.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm.
He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for his abdominal aortic aneurysm in one month.
