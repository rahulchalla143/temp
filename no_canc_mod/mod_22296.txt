Admission Date:  [**2163-8-31**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-9-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2132-10-12**]             Sex:   F  Service: NMED  Allergies: Dilantin / Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Azithromycin / Trileptal  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: HA, seizures, left sided weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: 30 yr old woman, 3 months post-partum, transferred from an OSH to the Neuro ICU for evaluation of L-sided weakness and consideration of stroke vs. seizure vs infection.
Pt reports left-sided weakness began just yesterday and that was preceded by 3-4 days of nausea and malaise.+ photophobia.
She did have a headache which is similar to her migraine for the last few days.
No neck stiffness.
The left-sided weakness was predominantly in her arm and was sudden onset; she had difficulty putting on her pants or underwear yesterday.
She also complains of parasthesias in her left arm and leg beginning yesterday.
Acyclovir was then started for diagnosis of viral meningoencephalitis after MRI, with OSH prelim reports stating "right parietal infarct vs. inflammatory disease, inc. diffusion signal on L side, ?
No history of drug abuse.
Patient has L facial droop in UMN pattern.
No tremors or fasciculations.
Sensory: Intact to pinprick, vibration, proprioception and temperature throughout.
MRI prelim reports stating "right parietal infarct vs. inflammatory disease, increased diffusion signal on L side, ?
This is most likely secondary to viral menigoencephalitis.
Left-sided weakness rapidly improved over her first few days in the hospital, with only a mild left facial droop and mild left hand clumsiness remaining.
At the OSH, she initially had focal motor seizures (and one secondarily generalized) involving her left hand and dilantin was started there.
While at [**Hospital1 18**], she developed paroxysmal paresthesias of her right face and hand, once accompanied by speech arrest as well.
When she began to have seizures again, since they were in a new location (right-sided as opposed to left), a repeat head MRI was obtained which showed bilateral tubular areas of susceptibility effect and T1 hyperintensity with surrounding leptomeningeal enhancement.
Two of the regions in the right post-central gyrus and in the left frontal lobe are associated with underlying white matter edema suggesting vasogenic edema associated with elevated venous pressure/venous infarcts, although there is no restricted diffusion.
Compared with the MRI from the OSH, there was enlargement of the existing lesions, no new lesions and resolution of the DWI abnormalities.
Location of the lesions was entirely consistent with focal seizures causing her symptoms.
However, the "tubular susceptibility lesions" in multiple areas of cortex were concerning for venous congestion or infarct.
Cortical veins showed no evidence of thrombosis.
However, the distal left transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus and proximal internal jugular vein was thrombosed.
Fever: When repeat MRI showed enlargement of lesions, it was unclear if this represented the natural progression of the disease vs actual disease worsening.
A few days later, she developed a worsening rash and started spiking fevers.
Pt had no localizing signs or symptoms of an infection, multiple cultures of blood and urine were negative.
Rash improved, but fevers persisted, and ID felt that these were most likely secondary to dilantin.
Rheumatological diseases were also ruled out with antibody screen.
Therefore, she was started on trileptal for her seizures and dilantin was slowly tapered.
A few days later she continued to have fevers to 104 and rash, and both lamictal and dilantin were stopped.
Fever began to improve, and she was discharged home with a diagnosis of dilantin-induced drug fever.
Transaminitis: Liver enzymes were checked as part of workup for fever, and both AST and ALT were mildly elevated.
Hepatitis serologies were negative, except for Hep B surface antibody positive, consistent with hep B vaccination.
It was thought that the elevations were most likely secondary to medication toxicity, a combination of round the clock tylenol (total 4 gm per day) for fever and dilantin.
Neurologically, she had a very slight left facial droop and left hand clumsiness, otherwise intact.
Ibuprofen 400 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Outpatient Occupational Therapy Outpatient OT for residual left hand weakness and clumsiness from viral meningoencephalitis 4.
Acetaminophen 500 mg Capsule Sig: [**1-7**] Capsules PO every eight (8) hours as needed for fever or pain: If taking fioricet, then do not take this at the same time.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Meningoencephalitis, complicated by seizure, neurological deficits, likely viral Left sigmoid sinus and internal jugular vein thrombosis Migraine Mild transaminitis, likely secondary to medication toxicity Fever, likely secondary to phenytoin   Discharge Condition: Good with some very mild residual left facial droop and slight left hand clumsiness.
Discharge Instructions: Please seek medical attention if you have any symptoms of severe headache, neck stiffness, inability to move your arm or leg, abdominal pain, rash, itching or any concerning symptoms.
Also, please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 58292**] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if you have any further tingling or uncontrolled twitching in your left arm, especially if it lasts longer than 10 minutes.
The current impression of the infecious disease doctors is that your fever is being caused by one of your medications and that when you go home, you may care for your baby as usual.
If your baby develops fever, rash or any concerning symptoms please seek medical attention right away.
