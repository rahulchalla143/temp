As the patient developed acute renal failure during her hospitalization, the workup for AVR was postponed, specifically cardiac catheterization.
Over the course of those three days, the patient developed chest pain and worsening dyspnea, concerning for flash pulm edema.
She reported that the chest pain was persistent in nature.
The patient had persistent 8/10 chest pain during her stay in the ED, requiring multiple doses of morphine 2mg and 1mg of dilaudid.
Other labs showed Trop of 0.41 and worsening renal function at 2.7. .
She was found to have a decreased respiratory rate and an O2 sat in the 80s on 4L NC.
The patient was placed on a non-rebreather and an ABG was sent which showed respiratory acidosis.

There are bibasal effusions present.
There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with moderate CHF.
In addition, there is an infiltrate at the right lung base which may represent superimposed infection.
CONCLUSION: Background moderate CHF with possible infiltrate at the right lung base.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %).
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 5 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body habitus.
Left ventricular function is mildly hypokinetic, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-3-28**], global LV systolic function appears mildly hypokinetic on the current study.
The degrees of mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension have increased.
The degree of aortic stenosis is similar.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 yo woman with severe aortic stenosis, diabetes, and morbid obesity who presents with dyspnea.
Her respiratory distress is likely multifactorial with contributing factors including respiratory supression from overuse of narcotics in the ED, pulmonary edema secondary to critical aortic stenosis and myocardial demand/ischemia, and underlying OSA.
She was kept NPO initally with thought that aspiration may have contributed, but eventually had speech and swallow which showed no evidence of this.
Etiology of her respiratory failure most likely CHF from severe AS.
Given her poor peripheral access, it would also be difficult to pursue valvulopasty.
Her respiratory status improved slightly but continued to have oxygen requirement and was unable to lie flat therefore she would have required intubation for this procedure.
She had worsening renal function likely secondary to poor forward flow and required high doses of diuretics to maintain adequate urine output.
Patient understood her poor overall prognosis given severity of her aortic stenosis with heart failure.
She was transitioned to hospice care, continued on morphine as needed for comfort and expired in the hospital several days later with her family by her side.
