REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She reports decreased urine output and some chills.
She was admitted to the MICU for likely diabetic ketoacidosis.
Type 2 diabetes on insulin with history of diabetic ketoacidosis, last admission [**2151-3-30**] with decreased mental status, question of temporary hemiparesis.
EEG revealed mild encephalopathy.
History of hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident with residual right visual defect in [**2147**].
Colonoscopy on [**2149-7-16**] revealed a sessile 5 mm polyp, diverticulosis of the transverse and sigmoid colon.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Right inferior quadrant anopia.
Neck: No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
Cardiovascular:  No carotid bruits, regular, rate, and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Neurologic: Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact except for a left facial droop noticed due to her decreased palpebral fissure, tongue deviates to the right, 3+/5 strength in the lower extremities, 4/5 strength in the upper extremities bilaterally, no tremor and negative Romberg.
CT of the abdomen and pelvis on [**2151-9-16**], no retroperitoneal hematoma.
A tiny nonspiculated nodule at the left lung base, small bilateral pleural effusions right greater than left.
Liver diffusely hyperdense, diffuse calcium throughout pancreas consistent with chronic pancreatitis, small calcium calcifications in kidneys, multiple uterine fibroids, no bone lesions.
Blood culture from [**9-14**]:  [**1-2**] gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters from the triple lumen catheter.
[**2-2**] peripheral blood cultures with gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
MRI of the brain [**2151-9-15**]:  No acute infarcts, no midline shift, no hemorrhage, old left hemi and left external capsular infarct unchanged, possible small vessel ischemic changes in the palms, chronic periventricular white matter, microvascular ischemic changes.
MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**]:  Mild stenosis of the left M1 segment of the MCA.
Chest x-ray:  Low lung volumes.
Heart within normal limits, no effusion or infiltrate.
EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm at 96 beats per minute, left axis deviation, no ST-T wave changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 55-year-old female with history of insulin dependent diabetes and history of diabetic ketoacidosis, hypertension, and hemorrhagic CVA in [**2147**] admitted with altered mental status with slurred speech with negative head MRI for stroke instead thought to be due to diabetic ketoacidosis.
Her mental status improved with a correction of her metabolic disturbances and she was transferred to the floor for further management prior to discharge.
Mental status changes:  Urinalysis and urine culture were negative.
CT of the head was negative for bleed and a MRI was done to rule out new stroke.
Patient's altered mental status was thought to be due to multiple metabolic disturbances upon correction of her diabetic ketoacidosis.
Chest x-ray was also done and was negative for infiltrate.
Normocytic anemia:  Patient with longstanding history of anemia of chronic disease.
Patient exhibited no elevated white blood cell count and remained afebrile.
All lines were either pulled or replaced, and a transthoracic echocardiogram was done to rule out bacterial endocarditis.
