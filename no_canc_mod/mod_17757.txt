Admission Date:  [**2180-12-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2180-12-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2113-11-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**] Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain, hypotension, fever.
History of Present Illness: Mr [**Known lastname 70851**] is a 67 year old male who is s/p Whipple surgery in [**2140**] for biliary versus pancreatic cancer, who presented to OSH with dyspnea and fevers.
Had an episode of RUQ abdominal pain earlier in day that resolved.
No nausea or vomiting.
Originally thought to be in CHF at OSH and treated with Lasix 40mg IV, and was also thought to have an infiltrate on CXR concerning for PNA.
However, labs at OSH showed elevated LFTs and bilirubin 2.6.
An abdominal US and MRCP were done, which showed mildly dilated intra-hepatic ducts that could be consistent with prior Whipple.
He then became febrile and hypotensive with SBPs in the 60s requiring a dopamine drip.
CAD s/p CABG [**2177-12-23**] with SVG to PL of Cx, SVG to OM branch, LIMA to LAD.
There were no bypassable targets in RCA territory.
CKD (baseline Cr 1.4-1.8 in [**2177**]) 3. chronic atrial fibrillation ?
of s/p MAZE or PVI on coumadin at home 4.
Pancreatic CA vs biliary CA s/p Whipple in [**2140**]'s 5.
Hyperlipidemia 7.
Cardiac Risk Factors include coronary artery disease, diabetes, and dyslipidemia.
Pancreatitis .
Father died of an MI at 65.
Brother had an MI at 66.
Another brother had a CABG at 55.
Two ovoid foci of high-attenuation in the pancreatic neck raising possibility of hemorrhagic lesions vs partially calcified lesion.
No pancreatic ductal dilatation.
Differential considerations include hemorrhagic metastases versus hemorrhagic pseudocyst vs amorphous calcification/debris in pancreatic duct, although no ductal dilatation.
Mediastinal and retroperiteonal lymphadenopathy, raising the possibility of an underlying hematological/lymphomatous malignancy vs. metastases, although not typical presentation for pancreatic metastases.
[**2180-12-7**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
[**2180-12-10**] HEAD CT: There are a number of small foci of diminished density within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres, most evident in the left frontal periventricular white matter and more distinctly within the left lentiform nucleus, and to a lesser extent, the right lentiform nucleus.
There is a probable punctate focus of diminished density within the right cerebellar hemisphere.
While nonspecific in etiology, given patient age, chronic small vessel infarction would appear the most likely diagnosis.
There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
There is mild peripheral cerebral atrophy.
There is heavy atherosclerotic calcification of the cavernous internal carotid arteries, and to a moderate extent, the distal vertebral arteries at the level of the foramen magnum.
The surrounding osseous and extracranial soft tissues reveal mild air-fluid levels within the sphenoid sinus, as well as mild bilateral ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening, likely representing effects of intubation.
CONCLUSION: No intracranial hemorrhage.
Probable chronic small-vessel infarction.
[**2180-12-12**] BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS: No deep venous thrombosis involving the right or left lower extremity.
There was no evidence of any bile duct obstruction seen.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was transferred from an OSH and was admitted to the General Surgical Service in the SICU on [**2180-12-6**] for spetic shock and cholangitis.
Abdominal CT revealed high density material in the CBD and projecting over the pancreatic neck and body, question of stones, calcification.
Mild biliary dilation, without other acute abnormalities to explain patients clinical condition.
Cardiology consulted; felt that EKG changes and troponin leak indicative of likely demand ischemia due to septic picture.
Patient takes coumadin at home for history of atrial fibrillation, arriving with INR 2.9.
NEURO: Upon return from OR for PTC placement, he was noted to have fixed and dilated right pupil.
He was intubated, sedated and still hemodynamically very unstable so a Head CT was unable to be obtained at this point.
Neurology and, subsequently, Neurosurgery were consulted for evluation of pupilary findings.
On [**2180-12-10**], the [**Last Name (un) 8745**] bolt was removed, and a Head CT performed, which showed no intracranial hemorrhage, but probable chronic small-vessel infarction.
Cardiology was consulted for uncontrolled atrial fibrillatio, and the patient was started on a Diltiazen drip.
Pulmonary: Upon admission, the patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation for need of aggressive fluid rescusitation and hemodynamic instability.
He became fluid overloaded, which responded well to CVVH diuresis, with resultant improvement in respiratory status.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
He had experienced respiratory alkalosis on [**2180-12-12**], which compensated with metabolic acidosis CRRT fluid changed to BB32.
Renal felt that the patient was experiencing acute renal failure in the context of a history of mild chronic renal insufficiency and acute spetic shock.
Final Renal recomemendations were enclosed with the patient's discharge inforamtion.
The PTBD was capped on [**2180-12-20**], which was well tolerated without abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or fever.
ID: Admitted with septic shock, with Blood culture at OSH with strep bovis/clostridium clostriforme, blood cultures here were negative.
Bile cultures with polymicrobial organisms.
The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
He was started on erythropoietin as part of his dialysis regimen.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
Polyvinyl Alcohol-Povidone 1.4-0.6 % Dropperette Sig: [**12-16**] Drops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for eye irritation.
Colace 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Septic shock secondary to strep bovis and clostridium clostridiiforme bacteremia 3.
Demand ischemia - resolved 4.
Anisocoria with elevated intra-cranial pressure - resolved 5.
Acute renal failure in the context of mild chronic renal insufficiency and septic shock.
Expect resolution with temporary hemodialysis.
Type II DM 2.
Atrial fibrillation 3.
CAD   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: Please resume all regular home medications , unless specifically advised not to take a particular medication.
PTBD Care: *Please look at the site every day for signs of infection (increased redness or pain, swelling, odor, yellow or bloody discharge, warm to touch, fever).
*Make sure to keep the drain attached securely to your body to prevent pulling or dislocation.
Monitor the hemodialysis catheter site for redness, swelling, increased pain, or drainage from the insertion site.
