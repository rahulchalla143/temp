No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and infero-lateral hypokinesis to akinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is no hydronephrosis, hydroureter, renal calculus or suspicious mass.
No perinephric fluid collection is noted to suggest abscess.
A 1.6-cm left simple renal cyst, previously documented in the [**2154**] CT study.
No evidence of perinephric abscess.
No hydroureteronephrosis or stone.
Of note, renal ultrasound is not sensitive to detect pyelonephritis which requires contrast to demonstrate abnormal parenchymal enhancement pattern.
There are scattered foci of endplate irregularities likely representing Schmorl's nodes and degenerative changes.
The intervertebral discs are mildly desiccated without significant loss of disc space height.
No evidence of disc herniation, spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing is identified.
No large epidural or intradural abnormal fluid collection or mass is identified (contrast could not be given as the patient refused).
Intervertebral discs demonstrate moderate desiccation with significant loss of height.
No large epidural or intradural abnormal fluid collection or mass is identified.
T12-L1: No disc herniation, spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.
L1-L2: Mild diffuse disc bulge is present which indents the ventral thecal sac without significant spinal canal narrowing.
L2-L3: A diffuse disc bulge is present with minimal flattening of the ventral thecal sac.
Facet arthrosis is present without significant neural foraminal narrowing.
L3-L4: A diffuse disc bulge is present with slight asymmetry to the right.
Facet arthrosis and ligamentum flavum infolding along with the disc bulge results in mild spinal canal narrowing and mild right neural foraminal narrowing.
L4-L5: A diffuse disc bulge is present which along with facet arthrosis and ligamentum flavum infolding result in moderate to severe spinal canal narrowing and moderate crowding of the nerve roots.
These degenerative changes result in moderate left and mild right neural foraminal narrowing.
L5-S1: A broad-based central disc protrusion is present without significant spinal canal narrowing.
Facet arthrosis is present but with moderate narrowing of the left neural foramen.
Along the posterior margin of the left kidney, there is a 1.6 cm T2 hyperintense structure likely representing a renal cyst.
The patient refused contrast which limits evaluation although no abnormal epidural fluid collection or mass is identified within the thoracic or lumbar spine on the non-contrast images.
Degenerative changes of the lumbar spine as described above.
There is moderate to severe spinal canal narrowing at L4-L5 due to degenerative changes resulting in crowding of the cauda equina.

She remains clinically stable, but had an episode of back pain without evidence of compression or abscess on MRI.
1) STEMI: She had an Inferior STEMI and was taken urgently to the cath lab where they placed BMS to the proximal and mid portions of the RCA.
Upon return from the cath lab she had resolution of ST segment elevation with out ICD, or bradycardia.
She remained chest pain free, but slightly tachycardic.
She was not initially placed on a beta blocker or ACE due to the development of sepsis from a UTI.
She was admitted briefly to the CCU for hypotension secondary to her sepsis, but upon arrival to the floor and volume resuscitation she was started on a beta blocker.
2) Sepsis [**1-24**] UTI: The patient had profound WBC count on her UA and has a positve Urine culture with gram negative rods.
She grew out E. Coli in her urine, but not in her blood.
When she spiked a fever on day #2 of admission she was also started on clindamycin.
She was give a 2 week course of antibiotics given her history of recurrent UTI.
3) Hematemesis/Anemia/Fe def: The patient had two episodes of hematemesis after admission which were secondary to a presumed stress ulcer.
The differential for her [**Last Name (un) **] includes injury secondary to hypotension,  although her urine output remains high and she was never oliguiric,  interstitial nephritis, and ATN with contrast induce nephropathy, excess diuretics prior to admission.
She had a renal US which did not demonstrate and pyelonephritis or hydronephrosis.
She also had repeated urine lytes which were not suggestive of a pre-renal etiology.
5) Ischemic Cardiomyopathy with h/o cardiogenic [**Last Name (un) **]: Although she became hypotension secondary to sepsis, she was never in cardiogenic [**Last Name (un) **] or volume overloaded.
6) Mild Elevation in Gap in the setting of ARF with CR 1.7, baseline 1.0.
She presented with a mild elevation in her gap that resolved with IVF and treatment of her infection.
She remained markedly erythematous and warm through out her hospital stay without a clear percipitatn for her drug reaction.
She also did not have any cutaneous ulcers.
9) Hyponatremia: The patient had a low serum NA with a urine osm and serum osm to suggest that she had SIADH, that was secondary to a chronic left sided effusion.
However, her hyponatremia resolved after the administration of IV fluids in the setting of her sepsis.
10) Back pain, Dejenerative Joint Disease without compression: The patients back pain continues to persist despite long acting morhpine, lidocaine patches, and hot packs.
She did not have evidence of a retroperitoneal bleed or fluid, but her MRI study was limited since she was not given contrast.
Of note, she did not have any decrease in perianal sensation, numbness, bowel incontinence.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 11851**] Healthcare & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: STEMI  Secondary Diagnosis: Sepsis from UTI Stress Ulcer/Gastritis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 65370**]  You were admitted to the hospital with a heart attack (STEMI).
Subsequently you had a infection in your urine that required you to go to the intensive care unit.
You also had bleeding from your stomach which was thought to be secondary to stress.
You were placed on antibiotics and medications that help prevent your stomach from bleeding.
You also developed diffuse redness across your body which may be due to a reaction to a medication you received.
He should arrange for you to have an EGD and a colonoscopy once you are no longer on plavix therapy.
