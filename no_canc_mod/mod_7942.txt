HD Tunnel catheter placement  History of Present Illness: This is an 87-year-old female with a past medical history significant for end-stage renal disease, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and anemia, who lives at a nursing home and was noted to have decreasing urine output and increasing BUN/creatinine.
The patient is followed by nephrology and had an AV fistula placed over the last six months in anticipation for initiation of hemodialysis.
History was unable to be obtained from the patient given lack of communication due to baseline mental retardation.
Per her nursing home records, she had had increasing lethargy and decreasing urine output.
Anemia secondary to end-stage renal disease.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 4, status post AV fistula placement complicated by stenosis status post by angioplasty with only residual stenosis.

History of MRSA peritoneal infection.
Mild mental retardation complicated by poor hearing.
HEENT:  Sclerae are anicteric, with no JVD noted.
CHEST:  Poor inspiratory effort and unable to assess for rales or crackles.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm, with a normal S1 and S2, no pericardial rubs noted.
Asterixis cannot be assessed given lack of cooperation.
No evidence of pneumonia .
[**2139-1-8**] ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**1-16**]: CXR: IMPRESSION:  Little change from prior, with retrocardiac opacity, possibly representing atelectasis, consolidation, or pleural effusion again noted.
Limited examination, however, no evidence of acute intracranial pathology or hemorrhage.
If needed, the scan could be repeated at no additional cost to the patient or further evaluation of etiology of altered mental status may be assessed with MRI.
2) Patent fistula with elevated velocities distally, up to 550 cm/s, suggesting outflow stenosis.
No DVT is identified.
IMPRESSION:  No deep venous thrombosis.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (?#) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**11-18**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2139-1-8**], the estimated pulmonary artery pressures indicate at least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation is now seen.
Tight stenosis along the venous aspect of the brachiocephalic fistula.
Contained rupture of the fistula during angioplasty, which was treated by balloon tamponade with resolution .

Her hospitalization was complicated by AV fistula laceration and hematoma, status post repair with subsequent stenosis of her fistula, and repair of the stenosis complicated by laceration.
Altered mental status.
The etiology of her mental status change was not entirely clear, but likely multifactorial.
The patient does have a known history of mild mental retardation at baseline, and per her [**Month/Day (4) 802**] was noted to "get like this" during her hospitalizations.
Morphine was held for concern of contributing to her altered mental status.
A CT scan of her head on [**2139-2-5**] did not reveal any acute processes.
Serial arterial blood gases during hospitalization did not show any evidence of hypoxemia or hypercarbia.
Following her PEA arrest, she did not regain consciousness and the family ultimately withdrew care.
On her first transfer to the medical intensive care unit for hypotension, the etiology was felt to be secondary to blood loss after AV fistula laceration.
However, her second episode of hypotension was felt to be of unclear etiology.
Her only potential infectious source was her known coag-negative staph bacteremia, however, she did not show any evidence of sepsis and had a normal lactate.
She also did not spike any fevers and was noted not to have a leukocytosis.
Her cosyntropin stim test was also without evidence of adrenal insufficiency.
She did have short requirement for vasopressors for several hours following the episode, however, was quickly weaned off.
On her third transfer to the medical intensive care unit following her PEA arrest at hemodialysis, ECG initially showed a new right bundle branch block that was concerning for a pulmonary embolus or myocardial ischemia.
However, a transthoracic echocardiogram showed no new wall motion abnormalities and no signs of right ventricular strain.
Subsequent CT, pulmonary angiogram did not demonstrate any evidence of pulmonary emboli either.
However, this was complicated by laceration of her fistula requiring repair by transplant surgery in the operating room.
She subsequently developed a tight stenosis in her fistula, which necessitated repair by interventional radiology with angioplasty.
However, she had persistent swelling and ecchymoses of her right upper extremity.
She subsequently underwent placement of a temporary hemodialysis catheter and started hemodialysis via this catheter on a Monday, Wednesday, and Friday schedule.
She underwent several sessions of hemodialysis uneventfully, prior to her PEA arrest at dialysis on [**2139-1-26**].
Aspiration pneumonia.
The patient developed a fever and was found to have developed a nosocomial aspiration pneumonia that was treated with vancomycin and Zosyn for a period of ten days.
given her mental status.
Atrial fibrillation.
The patient was noted to have new onset atrial fibrillation during this hospitalization with occasional episodes of rapid ventricular response with occasional hypotension.
However, in the setting of losing enteral access, and not receiving amiodarone, reverted back to atrial fibrillation.
Anticoagulation was not initiated in the setting of her recent hematoma from her AV fistula.
This was felt to most likely represent a contaminant, and felt unlikely to be the cause of her hypotension.
Transthoracic echocardiography did not demonstrate any evidence of valve vegetations.
Her tunneled hemodialysis catheter was left in place, as these positive blood cultures were not felt to represent bacteremia.
This was given intravenously when she did not have enteral access.
Iron studies were consistent with mixed iron deficient and anemia of chronic disease etiology.
Her anemia of chronic disease was felt to be secondary to end-stage renal disease.
in the setting of decreased alertness.
Right brachiocephalic fistula laceration and repair.
End-stage renal disease.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Atrial fibrillation.
Ulcerative colitis, status post ileostomy.
Morbid obesity.
