Patient reports initial episode of chest pain on [**1-4**], just after eating breakfast.
Described as pressure with some stabbing, mild associated back pain but without jaw or arm radiation or SOB/diapheresis.
At 6pm, just after dinner, the patient had recurrence of chest pain, similar in quality though more severe and with radiation to his back and bilateral arms.
This pain did not remit so he presented to an OSH for evaluation.
An ECG showed questinoable ST-elevations in V2-V3.
During his time at the OSH he did become chest pain fre.
He reported having chest pain and nitro and heparin gtts were continued.
During the procedure he continued to have back pain and an aortogram was performed showing no dissection.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea or palpitations, He does report some LE edema.
Of note, he reports that the pain he had surrounding his prior angioplasty was more back pain than chest pain.

P-R interval prolongation.
Low limb lead voltage.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
LMCA plus 2 vessel coronary artery disease.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension with elevated right sided filling pressures.
Echocardiogram [**2134-1-5**]: There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No thoracic aortic dissection identified but study is not adequate to exclude dissection (other imaging modalities such as TEE, CMR or CT are recommended for that purpose, if clinically indicated).
Echocardiogram [**2134-1-5**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with probable mid to distal anterior hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
ECG [**2134-1-6**]: Sinus rhythm Lateral T wave abnormalities are nonspecific but cannot exclude ischemia Since previous tracing of [**2134-1-5**], no significant change .
ECG [**2134-1-7**]: Baseline artifact Sinus rhythm; Anterolateral T wave abnormalities are nonspecific but cannot exclude ischemia ; Since previous tracing of [**2134-1-6**], further precordial lead T wave abnormalities now present  Brief Hospital Course: 1.
ST ELEVATION MI Mr. [**Known lastname 12412**] presented to the CCU after having a ST-Elevation MI and was found to have a left main coronary artery lesion on cardiac cath, a 90% diagonal stenosis and a 50-60% stenosed right coronary artery.
During the catheterization, the patient was having severe back pain.
An aortogram was done to assess for an aortic dissection and was negative for dissection.
He had an emergent echo to assess for pericardial tamponade which was negative.
The was weaned off the night of admission and his chest and back pain resolved.
He had one recurrence of chest pain the morning of [**2134-1-7**].
This resolved with sublingual NTG and there were no ECG changes.
He was discharged chest pain free on aspirin, plavix, lipitor 80mg, metoprolol and lisinopril.
He was told to continue his Plavix and not stop it for any procedure.
BACK PAIN The patient's back pain was felt to be an anginal equivalent.
He had an aortogram to assess for aortic dissection.
He had an echo to assess for pericardial disease.
His back pain resolved with resolution of his chest pain.
His EF was 50% and the echo showed mid to distal anterior hypokinesis of the left ventricle.
He had no signs or symptoms of heart failure during this admission.
HEMATURIA Mr. [**Known lastname 12412**] experienced a traumatic foley insertion during which the foley was difficult to pass.
He had hematuria after this with clots in the foley catheter.
Urology saw the patient on [**2134-1-6**] and recommended irrigation and further workup as an outpatient if the hematuria persisted.
ANEMIA The patient's hematocrit was 40 prior to admission per the OSH report and on admission to the [**Hospital1 **] was 32.6.
He had no evidence of bleeding but was started on heparin on admission until after the catheterization.
He had no evidence of bleeding from his GI tract but did have hematuria which was only present after the foley was placed.
BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY The patient was continued on his Terazosin.
He was chest pain free and hemodynamically stable.

Spinal Stenosis   Discharge Condition: afebrile, hemodynamically stable, chest pain free   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with chest and back pain and were found to have a heart attack.
Your pain resolved.
You experienced some blood in your urine with the foley catheter.
You should see a doctor sooner than this if you experience more blood in your urine or you have difficulty urinating.
You should call your doctor or come to the emergency room for any fevers > 100.4, chills, night sweats, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, bleeding in your stool, leg swelling, persistent blood in your urine, inability to void, or any other symptoms that concern you.
You should see someone sooner than this if you have persistent bleeding in your urine or you are not able to void.
