LUNGS - CTA bilat, no r/rh/wh, resp unlabored, no accessory muscle use HEART - RRR, systolic murmur appreciated on right and left sternal border.
ABDOMEN - distended, positive fluid wave (small),enlarged and palapble spleen, enlarged liver.
EXTREMITIES - no pedal edema, no calf tenderness 2+ peripheral pulses (radials, DPs) SKIN - numerous spider angiomas on chest and arms NEURO - Somnolent, drifting in and out.

Abd: soft, mildly distended, pos bs- normoactive Ext: no pedal edema, no calf tenderness Neuro: decreased LE stregnth bilaterally.
Large posterior epidural collection compressing the spinal cord from C2 to T1 and from T2 to T6.
The collection persists at the T1 and T2 levels, but causes less severe mass effect.
This could represent either an epidural hematoma or an epidural infection.
While evaluation is somewhat limited without contrast-enhanced images, either a hematoma or an abscess could show rim enhancement.
There is no evidence of osteomyelitis, but interspinous edema is present at C7-T1.
Cervical spondylosis, better evaluated on the prior cervical spine MRI.
Mild lumbar spondylosis.
Nodular liver, trace ascites, and splenomegaly, suggestive of cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
Since the previous study there is now more fluid identified at the laminectomy site and posteriorly in the cervical and upper thoracic region adjacent to the spinous processes with foci of low signal likely due to air within it.
This could be postoperative in nature but clinical correlation recommended to exclude infection in this fluid.
Enhancement and thin rim of fluid collection posterior to the spinal cord from C4-C7 and T1 level unchanged from previous MRI.
No evidence of prevertebral abscess or abnormal signal within the spinal cord.
[**2183-9-19**] CXR: FINDINGS: Bilateral asymmetrical airspace pattern in the mid and lower lungs is more severe on the left than the right, similar to the most recent prior radiograph.
Considering the shifting distribution and concurrent cardiac enlargement, widening of vascular pedicle and vascular engorgement, this probably reflects asymmetrical pulmonary edema.
Moderate left pleural effusion and probable small right pleural effusion are not appreciably changed.
Diffuse lung consolidations worse in the left mid lung are grossly unchanged.
There are no new lung abnormalities or pneumothorax.
There are no large pleural effusions.
[**2183-9-17**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Mild to moderate ([**2-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Small right pleural effusion.
MODERATE GROWTH.

Her SICU course was complicated by MSSA pneumonia, a left femoral DVT for which she was intially started on heparin gtt followed by coumadin on [**9-27**], and confusion felt to be secondary to sedating medications, potential alcohol withdrawal, and possibly hepatic encephalopathy (lactulose was discontinued on [**9-20**]).
She was extubated on [**9-26**] and her mental status improved significantly.
Medicine Floor Hospital Course:  # MSSA Epidural Abscess - Pt found to have epidural abscess s/p decompression and laminectomy, per ortho spine.
Pt treated empirically (vanco and cefepine and cipro) for epidural abscess and then narrowed to Nafcillin after sensitivities returned positive for MSSA.
CRP was trended during hospitalization to assess resolution of epidural abscess.
Pt continued to have recurrent low grade temps (99.9) which was attributed to her resolving epidural abscess.
[**9-17**] TTE negative for endocarditis.
RUQ U/S negative for any biliary infection.
# MSSA Pneumonia - CXR revealed left lower lobe pneumonia post-op.
Both the epidural abscess and the pna had the same MSSA infection and were treated empirically with vanco, cipro and cefepime, followed by nafcillin after sensitivities returned.
# Left femoral DVT/Coagulopathy - Pt has baseline coagulopathy with elevated INR in setting of cirrhosis and liver dysfunction.
Post op course complicated by DVT in left femoral vein.
Pt had recent normal endoscopy in [**3-/2183**] with no signs of esophageal varices.
# Diarrhea - Had diarrhea during hospitalization.
Likely secondary to antibiotics.
Lactulose was discontinued in setting of diarrhea and was not restarted.
When diarrhea completely resolves, pt should re-start lactulose at rehab to prevent hepatic encephalopathy.
Diarrhea caused K+ and bicarb wasting and she was repleted daily.
We gave her sodium bicarb tabs for her diahrea induced non-gap metabolic acidosis.
# Confusion, AMS - Pt had AMS while in the SICU, described as hallucinations.
Her home oxazepam was held and may be restarted at rehab if patient develops any anxiety or tremulousness.
Home lactulose should be restarted outpatient when pts diarrhea completely resolves to prevent hepatic encephalopathy.
Was on lactulose chronically at home but was stopped during hosptialization when pt had acute diarrhea.
Abdominal US was performed and showed moderate ascites.
**REHAB: -[**Month (only) 116**] restart lactulose when diarrhea resolves -[**Month (only) 116**] re-introduce home oxazepam if pt tremulous or anxious.
# Anemia - Has chronic anemia, on aranesp at home, likely related to splenomegaly and alcoholism.
In setting of diarrhea and fluid loss, Cr trended up slowly to 1.3.
Renal insuficiency thought likely to be pre-renal with possibly underlying chronic renal insuficiency from liver dysfunction.
# Hyperglycemia - patient without history of diabetes but was given ISS for hyperglycemia in setting of tube feeds and post-op.
# Hypothyroidism - Contined home regimen of levothyroxine 50 mcg daily .
# Depression - Contined home regimen of Zoloft 150mg daily & Ritalin 20mg TID .
# Multiple Sclerosis - Copaxone was held since admission since there was concern that it might make pt more immunocompromised in setting of acute infections.
Pt should resume copaxone after meeting with primary care physician and when acute infection is resolved.
