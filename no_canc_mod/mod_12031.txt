Admission Date:  [**2195-10-31**]     Discharge Date:  [**2195-11-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2122-7-19**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT: Status post transfer from [**Hospital3 1280**] for possible cardiac catheterization.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73 year old white male with a past medical history significant for previous myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2182**], who awoke on the day of admission with chest pressure and shortness of breath at 4:30 a.m., which was better with sitting up.
Review of systems at that time was negative for nausea, vomiting and positive for lightheadedness and palpitations which had been present at baseline.
He was acutely dyspneic and thus intubated, given nitroglycerin paste, intravenous Lasix 200 mg, intravenous morphine 2 mg and Versed.
At that point, he developed a mottled allergic rash and hypotension to 57/36.
It was thought to be an allergic reaction to morphine.
He was started on a Dopamine for maintenance of his blood pressure.
Prior to transfer, the patient experienced a one time ICD shock, presumably because of atrial fibrillation.
History of coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction at age 50, again in [**2195-5-22**], status post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2182**] with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal one, saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery; most recent cardiac catheterization in [**2195-5-22**] showed 100% proximal left anterior descending artery lesion, 50% mid- left anterior descending artery lesion, 70% first marginal lesion, 100% proximal right coronary artery lesion with collaterals coming from the circumflex to the right coronary artery, left ventricular ejection fraction 25% with mild mitral regurgitation; right heart catheterization showed elevated right sided pressures including a right atrial pressure of 24, right ventricular pressure 50, pulmonary artery pressure 52/20 and wedge of 33, cardiac output 6.05 and cardiac index 2.79.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post left femoral to anterior tibial bypass in [**2194-2-19**] with jump graft in [**2195-5-22**] and status post TPA several months later.
Status post AICD placement on [**2195-5-27**]; patient had been transferred from [**Hospital3 1280**] to [**Hospital6 8866**] after developing chest pain and shortness of breath; he was found hypotensive and in respiratory failure, requiring intubation; he became tachycardiac and went into pulseless ventricular tachycardia and required shock; he ruled in at [**Hospital3 1280**] with a high CK and, at [**Hospital6 8866**] workup included cardiac catheterization, echocardiogram and exercise tolerance test; ICD placement was also at that time; the device is known to be a Guident device, the details of which will be included in a discharge addendum.
General:  Intubated, awake, nods to questions, resting right hand tremor and head bobbing.
Neck:  No bruits, 10 cm jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, rub or gallop.
Extremities:  Clean, dry and intact, good dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses, trace edema in bilateral lower extremities.
Electrocardiogram from [**2195-5-22**] showed atrial fibrillation with a heart rate between 100 to 120, ST elevations and inverted T waves and Q waves present in leads II and AVF, ST depressions and inversions of T wave present in leads V4 through V6, inverted T wave also present in V1; this was compared with the most recent electrocardiogram from [**2195-10-31**], showing sinus rhythm with minimal ST elevations and inverted T waves in leads III and AVF, Q waves still present in leads II, III and AVF, right sided leads showed no ST elevation in lead V4R, there were occasional Q waves in leads V4 through V6.
Chest x-ray showed improvement in congestive heart failure.
Echocardiogram from outside hospital showed severely reduced left ventricular systolic function with a ejection fraction of 25% to 30%, akinesis of the posterior wall, basal and mid-portions of the septum and inferior wall, hypokinesis in the rest of the ventricles, 2+ mitral regurgitation, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation, enlarged left atrium.
Adenosine Cestimibi in [**2195-5-22**] showed a fixed inferolateral defect with a systolic ejection fraction of 26%.
Cardiovascular/coronary artery disease:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was continued on aspirin, nitroglycerin drip and heparin as per myocardial infarction protocol.
The troponin-I levels were not suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction per laboratory standards.
Thus, it was considered that the patient had ruled out for a myocardial infarction and heparin was discontinued.
Repeat cardiac catheterization was considered but, in light of Mr. [**Known lastname 5024**] recent catheterization and flat CKs, he instead underwent an exercise treadmill test on Tuesday, [**2195-11-3**].
This showed a severe fixed perfusion defect of the inferior wall and left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% with global hypokinesis.
No electrocardiographic changes or anginal type symptoms were evident.
On the night of admission, his ICD was interrogated, which showed atrial fibrillation.
He was asymptomatic throughout and his blood pressure was well maintained.
The patient underwent electrophysiology studies on [**2195-11-4**], which discovered multiple foci of atrial flutter, some of which were ablated.
At this time, his ICD was re-programmed for the shocking of atrial fibrillation.
However, it remained stable throughout the length of his stay and no further transfusions were needed.
Lines;  Mr. [**Known lastname **] had peripheral lines only.
He was seen by both physical therapy and occupational therapy, who deemed that he had no outpatient needs.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Congestive heart failure exacerbation possibly secondary to arrhythmia.
Coronary artery disease.
Peripheral vascular disease.
