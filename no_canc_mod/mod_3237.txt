with benign papillary stenosis and duodenal bulb stricture s/p multiple dilations (last in [**11-11**]) who presents with worsening RUQ pain and BRBPR.
Patient has had intermittent RUQ discomfort over the years, but  was doing well until approximately 3 weeks ago when she developed what felt like recurrence of her 'backed up biliary ducts' with  intermittent RUQ worsened by foods.
Yesterday the pain progressed and she called Dr.[**Name (NI) 12202**] office to schedule an appointment.
However, last night the pain worsened and she developed nausea and emesis x 1.
No melena prior to the BRBPR.
No fevers,  chills, dizziness, or lightheadedness.
Of note, has been taking  ibuprofen or excedrin nearly daily for HA's for many years.
Per report she  had one further bloody movement, but this was smaller than prior  and overall she thought these were improving.
NGL done and fluid  was slightly pink tinged but no frank blood or clots (1L of fluid lavaged).
Her HCT was 34 from baseline of 35 and she was given IV protonix and admitted to the floor for serial HCTs and monitoring with plan for ICU transfer if change in hemodynamics  or further signs of bleeding.
HCT sent at 9 pm returned 24, and at approximately the same time  she became lightheaded and dizzy with standing and HR elevated into the 120s with BP in 70s.

soft systolic murmur LUNGS: CTAB, good air movement anteriorly.
minimally tender s guarding in RUQ EXTREMITIES: No edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
EGD [**2110-10-18**]: A single cratered oozing 2cm ulcer with a visible vessel was found in the first part of the duodenum.
One endoclip was successfully applied at the lateral aspect of the ulceration over the vessel(clipping the vessel, the lateral part of the ulceration and a small amount of normal mucosa to the left of the ulceration) in the first part of the duodenum for the purpose of hemostasis with success.
No further bleeding after clip placement was seen on multiple relooks.
Repeat EGD [**2110-10-22**]:  Area of localized erythema and abnormal mucosa noted at junction of duodenal bulb and second portion of duodenum with clip from recent endoscopy in place.
No evidence of a cratered ulcer.
No evidence of active bleeding.
Colonoscopy [**2110-10-23**]:  No evidence of diverticulosis.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum  Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a generally healthy 47F c recurrent biliary sludge requiring ERCP and duodenal stricture req multiple dilations who presented with BRBPR and RUQ pain that radiates to her back in the setting of daily nsaid usage.
Bleeding duodenal ulcer: Pt presented with melena and hct had trending down from 33-30 in the ED.
NG lavage was positive for coffee grounds but cleared with 250cc and she remained HD stable in ED.
On arrival to the floor, she developped tachycardia and hypotension, repeat hct returned at 24.
Pt was transferred to the MICU and GI came in to perform urgent EGD which revealed a large duodenal ulcer with exposed bleeding vessel which was successfully clipped.
Her HCT continued to drift down, and repeat EGD showed well-healing ulcer.
She had a colonoscopy, which did not show a bleeding source.
She was advised not to take NSAIDS or aspirin.
# Acute blood loss anemia:  As above.
# RUE cellulitis/thrombophelibitis v. infiltrated IV:  This developed at an IV site.
Epilepsy:  She had no seizures on her home regimen of Keppra.
H/o biliary sludge:  She had intermittent RUQ pain that was at stable, at baseline.
RUQ ultrasound showed "unremarkable post-sphincterotomy study with small amounts of pneumobilia unchanged since [**2109**] and no evidence of ductal dilation."
Butalbital-Acetaminophen-Caff 50-325-40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for headache.
Disp:*20 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Duodenal ulcer .
Secondary: Acute blood loss anemia Hypertension Migraine   Discharge Condition: Stable, HCT of 32   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for bleeding in your gastrointestinal tract.
You had an upper and lower endoscopies and was found to have a duodenal ulcer that is healing well.
The ulcer was most likely due to use of ibuprofen and ibuprofen-like drugs, including Motrin, Advil, Naproxen, and Aleve.
You were started on a medication called pantoprazole to decrease the amount of acid in your stomach and to allow for healing.
You were also started on a course of antibiotics called doxycycline for the cellulitis on your right arm.
