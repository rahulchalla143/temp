Right lower extremity X-rays revealed a markedly comminuted and impacted right subtrochanteric femur fracture, with extension into right lesser trochanter, large butterfly fragments, and varus angulation.
A CT of the head showed contrast enhancement of right basal ganglia and posterior frontal infarct versus hemorrhagic conversion.
She was taken emergently to neuroradiology for emergent stenting of her right internal carotid artery and mechanical and chemical thrombolysis of her distal ICA and right middle cerebral artery.
The mechanism was thought to be cardioembolic or carotid thromboembolism.
Later that night, her RLE became pulseless and ischemic.
She was taken emergently to the OR for a right femoral thrombectomy, right femoral bovine patch profundaplasty, right external iliac stenting, and pelvic arteriogram and right lower extremity angiogram.
Repeat head CT scans showed an evolving right MCA infarct.
An echo did not reveal any intracardiac thrombus.
