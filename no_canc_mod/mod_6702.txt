Admission Date:  [**2106-8-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2106-8-26**]   Service:  [**Doctor Last Name **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted from his primary care physician's office with a 1.5-week history of cough and a 3-day history of shortness of breath.
The patient is a very pleasant 80-year-old male with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and a coronary artery bypass graft in [**2095**], who presents as well with cough and shortness of breath for a total of 1.5 weeks' duration.
The patient describes falling asleep approximately 1.5 weeks ago while eating and there was some question of aspiration at that time as the patient began coughing and found to have food in his mouth.
The cough also increased in frequency during that time.
There were no subjective fevers; however, the patient felt that he was "wheezing" at night which he had been in the past.
He did not have chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion, or orthopnea.
Per the Emergency Department staff, the patient was complaining of chest tightness relieved by two sublingual nitroglycerin; although, the patient himself denied experiencing chest tightness or pain when speaking to members of the medical resident staff.
Low back pain.
Coronary artery disease.
Chronic renal insufficiency, question secondary to hypertension.
A left bundle-branch block.
Congestive heart failure.
Stress test in [**2104-11-29**] limited by low work load; however, nondiagnostic for ischemic change.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   The patient also complained of a decreased hearing bilaterally for approximately one year prior to admission; although at times the patient reported a decrease in hearing for as many as one to three months.
The patient was in no apparent distress, appeared slightly cachectic with temporal wasting bilaterally.
There was not noted to be cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
No jugular venous distention was noted.
The patient did have slightly dry mucous membranes.
Heart rate was noted to be irregular with a [**2-2**] harsh systolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border.
On examination of the chest there was noted to be a midline sternotomy scar which was well healed.
On examination of the abdomen, the abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
There was no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Strength was [**4-3**] in the biceps, triceps, wrist extensors, dorsal interossei, hip flexors and extensors, as well as ankle dorsiflexion.
There was no effacement of the nasolabial fold.
The palate elevated symmetrically.
Repeated  measurements of creatine kinase was negative for acute muscle injury with values of 50, 45, and 51.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Chest x-ray performed on [**8-18**] and performed again on [**8-19**] showed blunting of the left costophrenic angle with minimal bibasilar atelectasis as well as flattened diaphragms.
There was not felt to be evidence of pulmonary consolidation at that time.
Multiple electrocardiograms performed on [**8-18**] were performed and read as "atrial fibrillation with underlying left bundle-branch block."
On [**8-22**], electrocardiogram was performed again with [**Location (un) 1131**] as follows:  "Regular wide complex cardiology with left bundle-branch block configuration."
Compared to the previous tracing of [**8-18**], the QRS morphology remained unchanged; however, the previously noted atrial fibrillation has been replaced by regular rhythm underlying mechanism likely supraventricular tachycardia given identical QRS morphology clinically.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the [**Doctor Last Name **] Medicine Service with the complaints as above.
empirically for presumed pneumonia versus bronchitis.
The patient's cough improved over the course of his stay.
The patient was seen by the Electrophysiology Service and was found to have recurrent supraventricular tachycardia, probable atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia.
On the morning of [**8-22**], at approximately 2 a.m., residence were called to see the patient for recurrent tachycardia.
Despite multiple efforts to control this tachycardia the patient remained tachycardic and was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit on the morning of [**8-22**].
On [**8-23**], the patient was sent for electrophysiology ablation which was performed without complication, and the patient was returned to the medical floor following this procedure in preparation for discharge.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Left bundle-branch block.
