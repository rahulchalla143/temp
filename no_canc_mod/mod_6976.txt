Admission Date:  [**2191-7-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2191-7-28**]  Date of Birth:   [**2121-3-21**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Location (un) **]  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Triple air leaking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70-year-old Caucasian male with history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea on BiPAP, coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction times two, atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, history of triple air repair.
The patient originally presented on [**2191-7-15**] to the [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital with abdominal pain and fever.
At that time, KUB showed probable ileus.
Over the next few days, the etiology of the abdominal pain remained unclear despite Gastrointestinal, Urology, Infectious Disease and Cardiology consults.
On [**2191-7-22**], he was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for question for leaky thoracic aortic dissection.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Coronary artery disease.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Right hip fracture status post open reduction and internal fixation.
9.  ?
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
FAMILY HISTORY:  History was notable for coronary artery disease and TB.
[**Hospital1 69**] course was notable for admission to Vascular Surgery Service, where he underwent CT of the chest on [**2191-7-22**], which showed evidence for diaphragm level, descending thoracic aorta aneurysm with penetrating ulcer versus mycotic aneurysm, without hematoma or bleeding.
Breathing became increasingly labored over the next few days and he was transferred to the MICU for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory distress management.
The MICU course involved activation of nebulized Albuterol and Atrovent steroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare, and continuation of Levofloxacin and Vancomycin for tracheobronchitis.
The patient was thought to have acute respiratory alkalosis or chronic respiratory acidosis by the MICU team.
GENERAL:  This is a chronically ill-appearing male in no acute distress; O2 versus nasal cannula.
Pupils equal, round, with minimal reaction.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Distinct heart sounds, regular in rhythm, no murmurs.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds, hypoactive.
No appreciable edema.
Scattered upper extremity ecchymosis, positive Foley.
Chest x-ray on [**7-25**]/200 showed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with linear atelectasis, scarring in the left upper lobe, no pneumothorax, no congestive heart failure.
Blood cultures from [**2189-7-15**] had 1 out of 1 bottle notable for Oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Sputum from [**2191-7-17**] had moderate Oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with 0 to 5 polys on high power field.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction.
HYPERTENSION:  Mr. [**Known lastname 22627**] had history of severe hypertension, but he has been under good control with Captopril 50 mg PO t.i.d.
The patient may undergo aortic repair after the resolution of medical problems and recommended no further imaging.
PULMONARY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 22627**] had severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation secondary to baseline severe disease.
He is continued on antibiotics, Vancomycin one gram q.12 hours for complete ten-day course for MRSA pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
The patient was thought not to be iron deficient at this time.
The patient has had workup for anemia over the past six months, which was unrevealing.
NEUROLOGICAL:  Mr. [**Known lastname 22627**] had new seizure without prior seizure history.
Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Obstructive sleep apnea on BiPAP.
Coronary artery disease.
Right hip surgery.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
