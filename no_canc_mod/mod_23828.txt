She was unresponsive at the scene and went to [**Hospital **] Hospital.
There she was noted to be hypotensive and tachycardic.
Scanning showed some type of intra-cranial hemorrhage, small lacerations of both the kidney and spleen, as well as a shattered left kidney.
There is good color change on the endotracheal tube HEENT: Pupils are 3-1/2 mm and constrict Collared; there is a left nasal abrasion Chest: Breath sounds equal Cardiovascular: Normal first and second heart sounds Abdominal: Soft and flat Rectal: No blood in the stool Extr/Back: No step-offs in the back Left buttock abrasion There is a left elbow abrasion Neuro: She is pharmacologically paralyzed [**Doctor Last Name **] Grade:4 GCS: EO: 3, motor: 6, verbal: 1T=10T  Cranial Nerves: I: Not tested II: opens eyes to voice.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Devascularized left kidney with only small amount of residual perfusion.
No evidence of active arterial bleed.
Visualization of only the proximal portion of the left renal artery and left renal vein near its confluence with the IVC raise the question of vascular pedicle injury.
Splenic laceration as previously seen.
Liver laceration as previously seen.
Horizontal (Chance) fracture through the L1 vertebral body with a small hyperdense focus, possibly representing extradural hematoma.
Left-sided rib fractures.
Stable small left intraventricular hemorrhage.
Question of additional foci of hemorrhage in the subarachnoid space, notably in the left frontal lobe.
Additional findings as on the final wet read- small left parietal SAH/SDH?
contrast related enhancement and left tentorial subtle hyperdense appearance-?
SDH/ prior contrast related enhancement and some degree of cerebral edema.
Stable small left intraventricular hemorrhage with possible additional foci of left parietal subarachnoid/subdural hemorrhage.
No evidence of new hemorrhage.
No fracture identified.
Findings suggestive of acute on chronic sinusitis.
Chance fracture involving the body and the right pedicle of L1, as described above, better seen on the prior CT study.
Areas of increased signal intensity in the interspinous region from T11-L2, which may relate to edema/injury to the ligaments in this location.
Multilevel mild degenerative changes as described above involving the discs  [**2152-12-20**] CXR : Bilateral airspace opacities mid to lower lobes, possibly infectious  [**2152-12-23**] CT Torso : 1.
No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess.
Interval moderate bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
Hypoperfused left kidney, asymmetrically small, with no evidence of urine excretion at the portal venous phase, compatible with the known traumatic injury.
New small contrast collection in the spleen, could represent repeated acute hemorrhage, the adjacent rib fracture now shows some displacement.
Unchanged liver and splenic lacerations as previously noted.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 916**] [**Known lastname 88468**] was evaluated by the Trauma team in the Emergency Room and admitted to the Trauma ICU for further management of her injuries as well as evaluation by the neurosurgery service.
She underwent serial hematocrits and neurologic exams.
She had no neurologic deficits from her small SAH with IVH and a repeat Head CT done 24 hours after admission showed no increase in the size of the bleed.
Her mini mental status exam showed some deficits with memory, attention span and delayed recall.
She developed fevers during her hospitalization and was pan cultures on 2 occasions.
The most revealing change was a chest Xray on [**2152-12-20**] which showed bilateral lower lobe opacities, possibly consistent with pneumonia.
She was then treated for hospital acquired pneumonia along with pulmonary toilet and she began to progress well.
2. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Grade 2 liver laceration 3.
Grade 2 splenic laceration 4.
L 1 Chance fracture 5.
Left rib fractures 6.
Pneumonia 7.
Acute blood loss anemia 8.
Discharge Instructions: * You were admitted to the hospital after your car accident with multiple injuries.
*  Your accident caused rib fractures which can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the pain.
*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths.
If the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and notify your physician.
*  Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.
*  You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and deep breathing.
*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid and fiber intake if possible.
*  Do NOT smoke  *  Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation around your ribs ( crepitus ).
