EMS arivved at the scence and note a right blown pupil on on route the the emergency department  Past Medical History: xx  Social History: Married and lives with husband  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: GCS  4t E:1      V:1  Motor:2  Gen: INTERBATED UNRESPONSIVE  Neuro: intubated, no eye opening, R pupil 6mm fixed, L 3mm, extending bilat UEs, min movement bilat LEs  CT:massive right temporal IPH   Pertinent Results: CT HEAD [**6-27**]  There is a very large right temporoparietal acute hemorrhage, causing prominent compression of the right lateral ventricle, and nearly 7 mm leftward subfalcine herniation.
There is a mild degree of edema surrounding this very large hemorrhage.
There is also accompanying uncal and hippocampal herniation on the right side.
There is moderate dilatation of the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] tip, likely due to entrapment.
CT angiography of the head reveals displacement of the right middle cerebral artery branches, consequence of the large right temporoparietal lobe hemorrhage.
Status post evacuation of a large right hemispheric intraparenchymal hematoma via a right craniotomy, with expected post-surgical changes and mild residual subarachnoid blood.
Slightly increased intraventricular blood.
Improved mild uncal herniation.
Unchanged mild effacement of the quadrigeminal cistern.
CT HEAD [**6-29**]  Slight decrease in left subfalcine herniation and pneumocephalus; other findings  MRI Head [**6-29**] 1.
Acute infarcts involving the left paramedian pons, right thalamus and subthalamic nuclei of the midbrain, and at the margins of the resection bed in the right temporoparietal lobe, as described.
No abnormal vascular flow void or enhancing vessel to suggest residual AVM, but evaluation for enhancing abnormality is limited due to intrinsically T1-hyperintense blood products   Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to the neurosurgery service and underwent an elective craniotomy for evacuation of left temporal ICH.
SHe tolerated this procedure well with no complications.
Her pupils remained asymetric but reacted to light.
The angio revealed no vascular abnormality but the MRI revealed thalamic and pons infarcts.
She was started on tube feeds via an NG Tube.An MRI was obtained to help with prognosis and this showed left sided acute strokes.
