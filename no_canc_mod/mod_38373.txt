Increasing mass effect with progressive subfalcine herniation measuring 6mm well as well as concern for impending downward transtentorial herniation.
Increasing intraventricular hemorrhage with dilatation of the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle, new from prior and concerning for developing obstructive hydrocephalus.
[**2106-2-21**] CT C-Spine IMPRESSION: No acute cervical spine fracture or malalignment.
A large expansile cystic lesion in the left mandible associated with an unerupted tooth, likely represents a dentigerous cyst.
[**2105-2-21**] EEG IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG because of continuous left hemispheric slowing with sharp features in the left frontocentral region.
These findings are suggestive of a focal structural lesion in the left hemisphere.
There is diffuse background slowing, indicative of a mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy, which is etiologically non-specific.
There were no clear epileptiform discharges.
There were no electrographic seizures.
[**2105-2-23**] Portable NCHCT IMPRESSION: Slight interval decrease in size of left parenchymal hemorrhage with persistent but slightly improved mass effect.
[**2105-2-27**] Renal US: No evidence of renal artery stenosis.
No evidence of hydronephrosis, renal stones, or renal masses.
[**2105-3-10**] NCHCT: Left basal ganglia intraparenchymal hemorrhage has decreased in density.
Surrounding white matter edema persists.
Mild rightward shift of midline structures and mass effect on the left lateral ventricle are not appreciably changed since prior.
No new hemorrhage.
Detailed assessment of parenchymal changes can be better performed with MRI if necessary and if not CI.
Status post left hemicraniectomy with expected evolution of adjacent soft tissue hematoma and fluid collection.
EKG [**2105-3-6**]: Sinus bradycardia with sinus arrhythmia.
Short P-R interval without other signs of pre-excitation.
Left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

Brief Hospital Course: Brief History: 55 yo M h/o HTN, HIV, Hep C, substance abuse p/w depressed LOC and found to have a large L basal ganglia hemorrhage with IVH.
Post-operatively, he was managed in the Neuro ICU with his primary issues being hypertension, respiratory difficulty, infection, and persistent depressed LOC.
[] IPH/IVH - His L basal ganglia IPH and IVH were thought to be secondary to hypertension from cocaine abuse.
His repeat NCHCTs did not show any significant expansion of the hemorrhage or resultant hydrocephalus.
[] Hypertension - In order to manage his hemorrhage, the patient was placed on several oral antihypertensives but he had poor response to most of them except clonidine.
He intermittently required a nicardipine infusion for further control.
[] Ventilator-associated pneumonia, Tracheostomy, Stridor - He was intubated perioperatively for respiratory support but twice [**Last Name (un) 92523**] extubation with excessive stridor and respiratory distress.
?He twice required broad-spectrum IV antibiotic treatment with Vancomycin and Piperacillin-Tazobactam for Streptococcus pneumonia/H.
[] Gastrostomy, Pneumoperitoneum - He underwent gastrostomy placement but the next day had abdominal discomfort with a finding of free air under his diaphragm.
There fortunately was no significant pathology found on the open operation.
11. nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for oral thrush.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left Cerebral Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage - History of hypertension - History of cocaine abuse/dependence - History of HIV infection - History of Hepatitis C   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Not examinable Level of Consciousness: Intermittently follows simple appendicular commands with his left side.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 732**] was admitted to the neuro-intensive care unit and neurology wards of the [**Hospital1 69**] for the evaluation of a fall and head injury that he sustained following the use of cocaine.
He was found to have a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in his left basal ganglia which ultimately required the placement of an endoventricular drain and a hemicraniectomy.
- Please bring Mr. [**Known lastname 732**] to the ED should you notice a change in his neurological examination, persistent fevers, low blood pressures, or any other unexplained signs or complaints.
