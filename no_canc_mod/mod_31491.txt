She has been feeling weak for the past 3 days, however has no localizing symptoms over that time.
5 days ago, she had an episode where she was trying to reach something no her bedside table but was unable to; she ended up sliding off the bed on her knees - no head strike/LOC.
Patient was initially refusing labs and interventions, however spiked a fever to 101.6 in the ED.
She received vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin to cover pneumonia as well as possible line infection as well as 2L NS.
CXR was done which showed low lung volumes and unable to rule out RLL infiltrate.
Head CT showed no acute intracranial process.
Past Medical History: 1. history of repeated GI bleeds: past work up revealing various  potential sources along her GI tract including small bowl AVM's,  colonic polyps, ascending and transverse colon diverticulosis.
Had L hemicolectomy with transverse colostomy and [**Doctor Last Name 3379**] pouch in [**10/2162**] with pathology examination revealing diverticulosis as the source of bleed.
Hypothyroidism 7.
Atrial fibrillation on amiodarone and coumadin 8.
Diabetes Mellitus 10.
HTN 11.
[**2168-1-28**]: Left Calf Ulcer Debridement 13.
[**2168-2-26**]: Left lower extremity wound debridement 14.
[**2168-4-19**]: left lower extremity angioplasty 16.
Left upper arm radiocephalic AV fistula [**2164**] , Left upper arm arteriovenous graft angioplasty , L upper arm AV graft [**2165**].
Grandfather died of cancer but son is not sure of what type.
denies any other history of CA, DM, or HTN in her parents.
Physical Exam: Admission: VS - Temp 98.1F, 101/56BP, 80HR , 18R , O2-sat 100% 2L GENERAL - well-appearing female in NAD, comfortable, appropriate  HEENT - NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI, sclerae anicteric, MMM, OP clear NECK - supple, no thyromegaly, LUNGS - CTA bilat with decreased BS RLL HEART - RRR, systolic murmur heard at apex ABDOMEN - NABS, soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding, colostomy bag in place EXTREMITIES - WWP, no c/c/e, 2+ peripheral pulses (radials, DPs)  NEURO - awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact, muscle strength [**5-13**] throughout, sensation grossly intact throughout, DTRs 2+ and symmetric, cerebellar exam intact, bilateral resting hand tremor  .
Discharge She is unresponsive to mechanical stimuli, does not have any respirations visually or to auscultation, no heart sounds, pupils are fixed and dilated, nonreactive to light.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2168-9-30**] there is no significant change.
CT HEAD [**2169-1-9**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
CXR [**2169-1-9**]: IMPRESSION: Small right pleural effusion and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Right basilar opacity is most likely atelectasis, but infection cannot be entirely excluded.
The previously noted non-specific ST segment abnormalities remain.
Biatrial cardiomegaly and possible pulmonary arterial hypertension.
No pulmonary emboli or acute aortic abnormality.
Small non-hemorrhagic right pleural effusion.
Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis, worse on the right, makes it difficult to exclude small foci of pneumonia, but there is no good evidence for pulmonary infection.
Moderately extensive mediastinal adenopathy, probably not related to heart failure.
Surface Echo [**2169-1-25**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Small linear structures under the mitral valve which appear to be consistent with torn mitral chordae are present.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with hyperdynamic function and resting outflow tract gradient.
Severe pulmonary hypertension.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Well-seated aortic valve prosthesis with mild regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: MICU Green Course:  The patient was initiated on broad spectrum antibiotics on the medicine floor and transferred to the medical intensive care unit for the management of septic shock and cardiogenic shock as follows.
84F hx of multiple medical problems: ESRD on HD (MWF), DM2, PVD (s/p multiple stents), Afib (on coumadin), AS s/pmAVR, recurrent GIB [**2-9**] diverticulosis s/p colectomy with ostomy who presented with hypotension.
coag negative oxacillin resistent bactremia which was thought to be due to mitral valve endocarditis.
Her left tunneled hd line, right radial arterial line, and left femoral CVC were removed; a two day line holiday was completed.
She was intermittently on Levophed with SBP from 70-120 in a span of two weeks; she spent a majority of the time requring levophed even after ititiation of midodrine and pseudophed orally.
After the patient's lactate was found to be 5 with a new anion gap acidosis, a repeat echocardiogram revealed worsening TR and pulm regurgitation, with severe mitral regurgitation.
CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism.
The patient was on a heparin drip for stroke prophylaxis due to her mechanical aortic valve.
Her elevated lactate and new echo findings were consistent with decompensating shock likely of a combined sepsis/cardiogenic.
A cardiology consultation was obtained, which indicated continuing cardiogenic shock with a complonent of sepsis as well.
The patient's vasopressor was weaned off but she became hypotensive again and she expired on the morning of [**2-/2169**] at 8:15 AM.
