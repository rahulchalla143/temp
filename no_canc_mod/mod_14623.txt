NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2128-5-31**]):    NO GROWTH.
VIRAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    No Virus isolated so far.
Reports: [**2128-6-1**] Cardiology ECHO GENERAL COMMENTS: Contrast study was performed with 3 iv injections of 8 ccs of agitated normal saline, at rest, with cough and post-Valsalva maneuver.
Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Based on [**2120**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No definite cardiac source of embolism identified.
This is consistent with no stenosis.
This is consistent with no stenosis.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of stenosis in either carotid artery.
[**2128-5-31**] Radiology CHEST (PA & LAT)   IMPRESSION: No abnormalities.
Specifically, no evidence for pneumonia.
[**2128-5-29**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)   IMPRESSION: No air space disease.
[**2128-5-28**] Cytology SPINAL FLUID [**2128-5-31**] NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Lymphocytes and monocytes  [**2128-5-28**] Neurophysiology EEG FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: There were frequent bursts of generalized delta slowing with a bifrontal emphasis.
BACKGROUND: Included a very well-formed [**9-25**] Hz alpha frequency in posterior areas bilaterally during wakefulness.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with occasional PVCs.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to the occasional bursts of generalized slowing.
This is a non-specific  finding with regard to etiology but implies a dysfunction in midline structures.
Nevertheless, some of the slowing may be due to excessive drowsiness.
There were no focal abnormalities or epileptiform features.
[**2128-5-28**] Radiology MR/MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST   FINDINGS: There are small foci of increased T2 signal within the subcortical and periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres.
Additionally, there is a larger area of increased T2 signal in the right parietal white matter, both in a subcortical location and adjacent to the atrium of the right lateral ventricle.
There is no definite mass effect in this location and no abnormal parenchymal enhancement is detected.
There is mild prominence of enhancement in the adjacent temporoparietal sulci, but this may be due to vascular structures.
No definite abnormal intracranial enhancement is observed.
There is no diffusion signal abnormality or susceptibility artifact within the brain.
MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates flow in the internal carotid arteries, anterior and middle cerebral arteries, the intracranial vertebral arteries, basilar artery, and posterior cerebral arteries.
No areas of aneurysmal dilatation are appreciated.
There is sinus mucosal thickening and perhaps fluid within the ethmoid and sphenoid air cells.
IMPRESSION: 1) MRI demonstrates T2 hyperintense abnormalities in the white matter of the cerebrum, which are nonspecific but may be areas of infarction.
No definite evidence of abnormal intracranial enhancement is observed, though a leptomeningeal neoplasm cannot be excluded with this examination.
The ventricles are not dilated and there is no intracranial mass effect.
Atrial premature beats.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
There is a retrocardiac opacity in the left lower lobe, which may represent atelectasis or consolidation.
No definite pleural effusions are seen, though there is blunting of the left costophrenic angle.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 64yo woman with HO cancer and recent headaches who p/w GTC seizure.
Despite the paralysis, patient had frequent twitchings on both arms and we decided to load the patient immediately with fosphenytoin 1000mg and gave ativan 4mg.
Given the history of cancer and recent headaches the lesion seen an outside head CT was concerning for a metastasis vs. stroke.
On further review and in talking with her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] appears that her breast CA was carcinoma in situ, removed completely with recent breast biopsy notable only for hyperplasia and not invasive CA.
An MRI was done with a lesion in the R parietal lobe most consistent with a previous thrombotic infarct.
EEG was abnormal due to occasional bursts of generalized slowing, a non-specific finding which may have [**Last Name (un) 6550**] from excessive drowsiness.
No focal abnormalities or epileptiform features were noted.
A workup was initiated for stroke risk factors, including a carotid u/s that was negative for stenosis, a transthoracic echo that was negative for ASD, PFO, wall motion abnormalities, systolic dysfunction or clot (EF>55% and mild LVH, bubble study negative).
CRP was elevated above 4, though should be repeated as an outpatient as she was febrile the night prior to this blood draw.
Homocysteine level should also be checked, and perhaps a hypercoaguability workup as well if indicated.
She had no evidence of DVT or PE on exam or the studies performed during this admission.
She did have hypertension above her goal SBP of 130mmHg, and was thus started and maintained on lisinopril without side effects.
Cerebral vascular accident, in past   Discharge Condition: Stable, with no more seizure activy  Discharge Instructions: Please continue to take all medications as prescribed and follow up with your doctors.
If you have seizures after your discharge, please return to the Emergency Room and notify your doctors.
