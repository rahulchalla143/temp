# Hypoxia/multifocal pneumonia/gram positive cocci bactermia: The patient's presentation of fever, leukocytosis, and tachycardia along with the CXR showing a multifocal PNA point towards a lung infection as his underlying process.
Blood cultures grew out gram postive cocci, later speciated to pansensitive strep pneumo.
He had no recent CD4 count so this was repeated and returned at 71.
# Hepatocellular injury:  Patient with acutely elevated bilirubin and INR with a moderate transaminitis.
With the preceding viral-like illness would consider EBV/CMV/VZV/influenza as well as bacterial infection with legionella most likely.
Abdominal ultrasound was consistent with acute hepatitis.
Liver was consulted and felt his findings were likely from liver-induced injury due to sepsis.
Several viral serologies, acute hepatitis serologies, autoimmune workup, and iron studies/ceroplasmin were sent for additional workup and did not reveal any cause of liver injury.
A CMV was also checked and returned with CMV IgG positive, but viral load was negative.
# Hyponatremia: Patient was initally hyponatremic with a Na of 120 which improved with volume resuscitation.
