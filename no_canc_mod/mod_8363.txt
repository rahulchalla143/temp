This summer, the patient had a routine URI which resulted in ESRD secondary to post-streptococcus glomerulonephritis.
Past Medical History: - NASH cirrhosis - diagnosed by biopsy in [**2168**], c/b ascites, s/p TIPS [**2176-12-3**] and redo [**4-/2177**] and s/p ablation of three grade I esophageal varices -[**2178-11-1**]  Piggyback liver [**Month/Day/Year **] with removal of the portal stent and duct-to-duct hepaticojejunostomy.
- Ulcerative colitis diagnosed in [**2176**] - HTN - IDDM - S/p tonsillectomy - [**2178**]: ESRD secondary to post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis -[**2178-11-1**] Cadaveric renal [**Month/Day/Year **] left kidney to right iliac fossa.
Does not drink alcohol, no drugs.
No masses Ext: venous stasis changes.
A liver biopsy was performed on [**11-6**] noting mild to focally moderate Zone 3 cholestasis with focal feathery degeneration of hepatocytes, consistent with preservation/reperfusion injury.
On [**11-9**], repeat liver duplex showed patent hepatic vasculature.
No biliary dilatation and no collections were identified.
No anastomotic stricture.
Diffuse beaded contour of intrahepatic ducts.
Diagnostic considerations include changes related to arterial ischemia or primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Removal of sludge-like filling defect.
On [**11-11**], IR performed the following: Celiac axis, SMA, and common hepatic artery arteriograms demonstrating common hepatic artery (70% plus) stenosis of the common hepatic artery, possibly at the point of anastomosis.
Placement of 6 mm x 18 mm balloon-expandable stent within the common hepatic artery and deployment of 6 French Angio-Seal device to the left common femoral artery access point.
A renal biopsy was performed on [**11-11**] showing considerable donor chronic vascular changes and some of the findings raise the possibility of (donor) diabetic nephropathy.
Given poor graft function, he was relisted for liver and kidney [**Month/Year (2) **].
20. heparin, porcine (PF) 10 unit/mL Syringe Sig: Two (2) ML Intravenous PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
Discharge Diagnosis: esrd nash cirrhosis DM s/p liver/kidney [**Month/Year (2) **] extensive kidney donor disease Hepatic artery stenosis with ischemic liver disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
