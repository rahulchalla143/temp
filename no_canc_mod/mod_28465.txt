Maternal history was also notable for asthma on no medications.
On the day of delivery, the mother represented with rupture of membranes and preterm labor.
Baby Girl [**Known lastname **] was delivered by cesarean section for breech presentation.
Her HEENT exam was significant for an anterior fontanelle that was open and flat.
Her lung exam revealed coarse breath sounds with fair aeration bilaterally and moderate grunting with retractions.
Her cardiovascular exam showed regular rate and rhythm with no murmur and good femoral pulses.
Her abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended and without masses.
Her skin exam was notable for a 2 mm superficial laceration over her right patella.
She does occasionally have episodes of apnea of prematurity but has never required therapy with caffeine.
Most of her episodes of apnea presented as desaturations with feedings.
Her last episode of desaturation was on [**12-20**].
She did have a murmur noted on exam on day of life 20.
At that time, an EKG, chest x-ray and echocardiogram were performed and all of those tests were normal.
The murmur is felt to be likely peripheral pulmonic stenosis.
Feedings were initiated at that time and she was advanced to full breast milk or premature Enfamil feeds by day of life 6.
Also of note, she had a history from prenatal ultrasound  of right-sided mild hydronephrosis.
This was followed up with a renal ultrasound on [**11-20**], which revealed mild left pelviectasis.

Eye exams were also performed due to her slight risk of retinopathy of prematurity.
