Admission Date:  [**2184-8-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2184-9-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2125-2-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Lisinopril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2074**] Chief Complaint: STEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: CAD s/p 2 cardiac catheterizations with stents to LCX, RCA, LAD   History of Present Illness: 59 yo F with PMH of HTN who developed L sided sharp [**8-25**] chest pain on Saturday morning.
She also complained of bilateral arm pain with numbness and tingling, orthopnea, SOB.
The SOB and pain got worse with exertion (walking around).
She tried ultram with no benefit.
No nausea, vomiting.
Plan for PCI of LAD in 48 hours.
She was transferred to the CCU with bradycardia in the 50's, nausea and hypertension.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Degenerative spine  Social History: Lives alone, no children, smokes 2 PPD for many years, no ETOH, no drugs   Family History: MGM with CAD DM   Physical Exam: Vitals: T 96.6         BP 170/85 (170-200-85-105)         HR 54-60         R 16         Sat 100% 2L * PE: G: NAD     HEENT: Clear OP, MMM     Neck: No LAD, No JVD.
No carotid bruits.
Pertinent Results: RAD: CTA - no PE, coronary artery calcif.
Selective coronary angiography demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease in this right dominant circulation.
The LAD had moderate proximal calcifications.
There was an 80% stenosis after the D1.
The LCX had a 90% proximal stenosis after a high OM1 branch.
There was 50% stenosis in the distal RCA before the PDA branch.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated severe systemic arterial hypertension (210/99).
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stented segment of the RCA, no apparent dissection, and normal epicardial flow (see PTCA comments).
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stented segment of the LCX, no apparent dissection, and normal epicardial flow (see PTCA comments).
Acute inferior MI managed by PTCA and placement of 2 drug-eluting stents in the RCA and placement of 1 drug-eluting stent in the LCX.
Severe systemic arterial hypertension.
The LAD had a tubular 80% stenosis in the mid vessel.
The LCX was a nondominant vessel with a widely patent stent and moderate diffuse disease in OM3.
Liited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic systolic hypertension (171 mmHg).
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2184-9-3**] EF>60% Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest c/w a small secundum atrial septal defect (ASD).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Small secundum type atrial septal defect.
Based on [**2176**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and  echocardiographic data.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo F with STEMI status post cardiac catheterization on [**2184-8-30**] with three vessel coronary artery disease, and acute inferior MI managed by PTCA and placement of 2 drug-eluting stents in the RCA and placement of 1 drug-eluting stent in the LCX.
Her hospital course was complicated by angioedema presumably secondary to an ACE inhibitor (captopril), which was discontinued, and her angioedema managed with IV solumedrol transitioned to prednisone taper with benadryl as needed.
She also has systemic hypertension, complicated by medication non-compliance secondary to fear/anxiety concerning the angioedema side effect.
ST semgent elevation myocardial infarction: The pt is status post inferior myocardial infarction with cardiac cath showing 3 vessel disease, taken for stents to LCX and 2 stents to RCA on [**2184-8-30**], then taken back to cath lab on [**2184-9-3**] for stenting of LAD.
The risks of uncontrolled hypertension were explained to the patient.
Her Echocardiogram post-caths demonstrated an EF of >60%, with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function, mild-moderate mitral regurgitation, and a small secundum type atrial septal defect.
# angioedema- Most likely secondary to the ACE inhibitor Captopril that we started her on post-catheterization for blood pressure control.
Her lungs were without wheezes, or stridor.
She did not have any throat swelling or difficulty breathing.
Her angioedema mainly involved swelling of the lips and periorbital areas, with gradual resolution over 4 days.
[**First Name (STitle) 3510**], who was notified of the angioedema and her uncontrolled hypertension with refusal to take all of her blood pressure meds.
It was documented in the computer that she is allergic to captopril.
She was explained the side effects of having high blood pressure.
Back pain: The pt has a history of low back pain secondary to degenerative joint ds/slipped disc in her lower spine.
She was given Ultram PRN, which controlled her pain well.
At discharge, she was not complaining of low back pain.
The RN explained to her that the hospital is a No-Smoking area, and that she should not smoke.
She was immediately seen by a physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] started on nicotine patch, however, she would not hand over her cigarettes and refused to quit, so the nicotine patch was discontinued for fear of her wearing both the patch and continuing to smoke.
CAD s/p cardiac catheterization with stents to LCX, RCA, LAD 3.
Hypertension 4.
Chronic low back pain   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: Take all medications as prescribed.
Return to the ER for chest pain, shortness of breath or other concerning symptoms.
