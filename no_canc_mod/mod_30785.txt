LINE PLACEMENT  Reason: line placemnt  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 81 year old man with resp distress REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: line placemnt HISTORY: Line placement.
There is slight interval worsening of interstitial edema.
IMPRESSION: Interval worsening of interstitial edema.
mesenteic ischemia w/ lactate 9.6.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for mesenteric ischemia CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial CT images of the abdomen and the pelvis were obtained without the administration of intravenous or oral contrast.
FINDINGS: The evaluation of abdominal organs and major vessels are extremely limited due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
There is no evidence of free air or free fluid.
Note is made of mildly dilated small bowel in the midabdomen with air-fluid level, measuring up to 3.1 cm.
The limited evaluation of the abdominal organs demonstrates no focal liver lesion.
There is right adrenal mass with 6HU, representing adenoma.
Kidneys are somewhat atrophic with large left renal cyst.
There is no significant lymphadenopathy.
PELVIS: There is no evidence of ascites.
No free fluid or free air.
In the visualized portion of the lung bases, note is made of bibasilar consolidations with small amount of effusion.
There is no suspicious lytic or blastic lesion in skeletal structures.
SI joints are fused due to degeneration.
CT study for the evaluation of mesenteric vessels and abdominal organs for mesenteric ischemia without intravenous contrast.
Mildly dilated small bowel in the midabdomen measuring up to 3.5 cm with air-fluid level.
Bilateral renal cysts.
Some of the small low density lesions on the right kidney are too small to characterize.
Right aderenal adenoma.
Bibasilar consolidations with small effusion.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2193-10-18**] 11:01 AM  PORTABLE ABDOMEN  Reason: evalf or acute process  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 81 year old man with resp distress REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: evalf or acute process INDICATION: 81-year-old man with respiratory distress.
Evaluate for acute process.
Air-filled dilated small and large bowel is identified.
There is no evidence of free intraperitoneal air; however, the diaphragms are not visualized on this radiograph.
IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated air-filled small and large bowel without air definitively seen in the rectum.
This may represent an ileus versus a low obstruction.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2193-10-19**] 6:15 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: interval change  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 81 year old man with resp distress REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: interval change PORTABLE CHEST.
History of respiratory distress.
There are persistent bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, which most likely represent edema.
Compared with the previous study, there is slight interval worsening at the bases.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with edema.
Slight interval worsening.

A CT scan demonstrated mildly dilated small bowel with air-fluid level, no free air, and bibasilar consolidations with small effusion.
He has a history of seizures and is stable on Phenobarbital, his level was therapeutic and his current dose was continued intravenously.
On HD 2 his white blood cell count had decreased to 12.2k, he was successfully extubated, and he was without abdominal pain.
His antibiotics were discontinued secondary to his cultures being mixed oropharyngeal flora; blood cultures were pending at the time of discharge.
He still had bilateral lower extremitiy edema with improvement.
He was requiring 2 liters nasal cannula to maintain his saturations above 94% with no respiratory distress.
Loperamide 2 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for diarrhea.
