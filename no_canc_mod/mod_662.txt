FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates interval increase of bilateral fluffy perihilar and infrahilar opacities as well as obscured and prominent cardiac silhouette, compatible with moderate congestive heart failure.
There is persistent opacity involving the cardiophrenic angles.
Supervening pneumonia and or aspiration cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
Small effusions cannot be excluded.
There is no pneumothorax.
Atherosclerotic calcifications are seen in the aortic arch.
Findings compatible with moderate congestive heart failure, with interval worsening since [**2157-8-30**].
Supervening lower lobe infection and/or aspiration cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
[**11-22**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-20**], there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with decreasing pulmonary vascular congestion.
Confluent lower lobe opacities are consistent with regions of pneumonia, especially at the right base.

# CHF exacerbation:  On admission, patient was in severe respiratory distress requiring intubation in the ED for hypoxia.
CXR demonstrated fluid overload.
Per family and patient, he did not make any diet changes and was compliant with medications, thus cause of exacerbation is unclear.
ACS was ruled out as a cause of CHF exacerbation with 2 sets of neg cardiac enzymes.
Continued diltiazem, losartan for BP control.
# Pneumonia: On admission, CXR consistent with a bilateral pneumonia given the fluffy bases which have a slight nodularity.
This could be consistent with a bacterial or viral illness.
However, he did not initially have leukocytosis and his family denied recent increase in sputum, fevers, muscle aches, or generalized illness.
#CAD: Continue statin, ASA for CAD primary prevention .
# Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): History of non-compliance with his advair due to costliness and also trouble getting his oxygen at home.
Because he was not wheezing on exam and his CXR was more consistent with volume overload than hyperinflation, the steroids that were started in the ED were not continued in the ICU.
# Chronic kidney disease:  Admission Creatinine was at baseline.
# Diabetes mellitus, type 2 (DMT2): Maintained on sliding scale.
# GERD: Continued PPI .

Disp:*1 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS Acute diastolic heart failure exacerbation Pneumonia .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital because you were having difficulty breathing.
We think that you had an exacerbation of your chronic heart failure.
You were also found to have a pneumonia which was treated with antibiotics.
