He was started on Caspofungin and he was afebrile overnight.
On HD 3, he underwent a repair of his colovesical fistula and a sigmoid colectomy (please see operative note for details).
He was also acidotic with a pH of 7.25 despite a PCO2 of 42, so he recieved several fluid boluses for post operative hypovolemia (and oliguria).
On POD 1, he had a mild temperature to 100.
On POD 3, his abdomen was still slightly distended but not tender.
He was on a PCA for pain control.
He had a lot of diarrhea and a rectal bag was placed.
Later that night, he spiked a fever to 103.4.
He became tachycardic to 125 and hypertensive to an SBP of 178.
A chest X-ray showed bilobar opacities.
On POD 5, he continued to run low grade temperatures.
A repeat CXR showed a left lower lobe opacity and small bilateral effusions.
A CT of the abdomen was obtained to rule out an intra-abdominal source of infection and it showed a partial small bowel obstruction, and a large amount of intraabdominal free air and free fluid, with high-attenuation material within the free fluid consistent either with blood or contrast leak.
He was in respiratory distress and was intubated emergently by anesthesia and transferred to the ICU.
He was then taken to the OR for an emergent exploratory laparotomy, repair of anastasmotic leak from the colon, and transverse loop colostomy.
He required Neosynepherine for BP control.
We continued with aggressive chest PT and serial ABGs.
That night, his central line was removed due to erythema and the tip was sent for culture (which subsequently grew Acinetobacter), so he was maintained on only perhiperal IVs.
His abdominal wound was granulating well and required TID wet:dry dressing changes.
His wound was covered in fibrinous material, which was debrided to good granulation tissue.
