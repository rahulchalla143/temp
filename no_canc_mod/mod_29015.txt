She is twin #1 who was admitted to the NICU with prematurity and respiratory distress.
The maternal history was notable for multiple pregnancy losses.
The pregnancy was notable for di-di twin gestation and placement of cerclage at 14 weeks gestation.
Twenty-four hours later mother developed foul smelling vaginal discharge and uterine tenderness concerning for chorioamnionitis, and induction of labor was begun.
Amniotic fluid around Twin A was low.
There was a cord prolapse noted 7 minutes prior to delivery, during which time no heartbeat was noted in the prolapsed cord.
At the delivery there was foul smelling residual amniotic fluid.
The infant emerged limp and dusky but with weak, irregular respirations and weak spontaneous movement.
Infant was intubated at approximately 5 minutes of age for poor respiratory effort and then brought to the NICU.
Skin is warm, pink, diffusely bruised around scalp with small bruises on the lower extremities.
HEENT: The fontanels are full, soft and flat, sutures mildly split with mild cephal molding and 1 cm-2 cm area of swelling and bruising on the left upper parietal scalp.
No underlying bony deformity is noted.
Chest has coarse, tight breath sounds and poorly aerated.
Cardiac: There is a regular rate and rhythm and no murmur.
Extremities: Back is normal and there are no lesions.
She was transferred to conventional ventilation on day of life 2 and remained on low-ventilation settings until day of life 9 when she started to have increasing ventilator settings.
She has received vitamin A prophylaxis for premature lungs.
She had no murmur audible but presented symptomatic a patent ductus arteriosus.
She had an echo on [**2141-12-4**], which showed no patent ductus but became symptomatic of a ductus with widening pulse pressures, bounding pulses and a murmur on [**2141-12-6**].
She became symptomatic of PDA again with increasing ventilator setting.
On day of life 14, which was [**2141-12-16**], a repeat echo was done which showed a small patent ductus arteriosus.
The infant continues to have a central PICC at this time.
She has had history of electrolyte instability, but at this point in time her electrolytes on [**2141-12-21**], are sodium 142, potassium of 3.3, chloride 104, CO2 of 24.

The newborn screens have been sent on [**2141-12-8**], and that result showed a low T4 with a borderline elevated OHP.
She has received no immunizations.
