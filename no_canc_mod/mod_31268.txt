By report, pt had had high residuals from G-tube and a KUB demonstrated an ileus.
The pt was intubated fiberoptically by Anesthesia given the degree of kyphoscoliosis.
A CT torso revealed multifocal PNA and a ?
early or partial SBO.
Past Medical History: # moderate to severe dementia # Osteoporosis # Chronic Diastolic Heart failure # mild-moderate systolic pulmonary hypertension # history of depression # Malnutrition - moderate to severe, likely secondary to dementia # atrial fibrillation # aspiration pneumonia ([**1-18**], with complicated course with intubation, pressors, VAP, tension pneumothorax from line insertion, chest tube, thrombocytopenia)   Social History: - Ms. [**Known lastname 98899**] [**Last Name (Titles) 546**] at [**Hospital1 599**] of [**Location (un) 55**].
Multifocal air-space consolidation in the lungs with dense left lower lobe consolidation are most consistent with aspiration related pneumonia (given the peribronchovascular distribution and impaction in the left lower lobe airway).
Stable appearance of right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.
Moderate colonic fecal loading.
CXR [**2106-5-9**] - Extremely limited study with cardiomegaly and mild CHF.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
ESCHERICHIA COLI.
MODERATE GROWTH.

1)Aspiration pneumonia and sepsis: On admission she had respiratory failure and sepsis most likely [**3-15**] aspiration pneumonia given multifocal infiltrates on chest ct from [**2106-5-9**].
She was initially treated for healthcare associated pneumonia with vancomycin, zosyn and levofloxacin and she completed an eight day course.
On [**2106-5-25**] she was successfully extubated after passing a spontaneous breathing trial.
Given the near certainty that oral feeding will result in recurrant aspiration pneumonia and sepsis, she should be not be given anything by mouth.
Initially concerning for possible cause of sepsis on admission, given that one set of blood cultures from admission were positive for GPC's.
This ended up growing coagulase negative staph in one bottle only with all other blood cultures throughout her admission negative, indicating that this was most likely a contaminant.
She had dressing changes daily with packing of the large sacral decubitus with antimicrobial kerlex daily.
3)Hx AFIB: She was in sinus rhythm throughout her admission, without any episodes of Afib with RVR.
She should be kept NPO due to high risk for aspiration.
5) Dementia - during her admission her namenda was held due to severe illness.
