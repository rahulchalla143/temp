HPI: 65 yo F w/ progressive neuro Lyme (dx'ed in [**2194-12-4**], aphasic, immobile at baseline, tube feed-dependent) who p/w to OSH on [**9-4**] from home for worsening SOB x 3 days.
EKG showed ST elevations in V4, V5, ST depression in V3, diffuse Tw inversions, Q waves in II, aVF.
On the morning of transfer ([**9-5**]), pt developed hypercapnic respiratory failure with ABG 7.18/74/137.
Her EKG showed ST elevations in I, II, III, aVL, AVF, V2-6, Q waves in II, III, aVF, V5, V6; diffuse, deep inverted T waves.
Given levophed and dopamine, and BP increased to 120s/60s.
Family History: Mother: lung cancer (heavy smoker)  Physical Exam: T 99.8, HR 117, BP 93/52, O2 100% with vent settings of TV 500, RR 15 PEEP 5, FiO2 40%,(7.46/28/115) NAD: Intubated, able to communicate by squeezing R fingers for "yes", not squeezing for "no", grimacing Lungs: CTA bilaterally from anterior CV: Tachy, nl S1 & S2, [**2-9**] descrescendo systolic murmur loudest at LUSB Abd: PEG in place, soft, NT, ND, BS present, no mass Ext: cold, faint pedal pulses bilaterally   Pertinent Results: STUDIES: * EKG [**9-5**] 4 am (OSH): NSR @ 83 bpm, ST elevations in I, II, III, aVL, AVF, V2-6, Q waves in II, III, aVF, V5, V6; diffuse T wave inv * EKG [**9-5**] 2 pm ([**Hospital1 18**]): Sinus tach @ 135 bpm, RBBB; ST elevations in II, III, aVF, V4, V5, V6; ST depressions in V1; Q waves in I, II, III, aVF, V4, V5, V6; TWI in II, III, aVF, V1 to V6 * Cath [**9-5**]: LVEDP 15, LVEF 30%, ant and apical inf severe hypokinesis; LMCA nl; LAD proximal-mid 70%, likely infarct related artery with probable spontaneous reperfusion and 70% residual and nl flow; LCx nl; RCA 20% mid; ventriculography revealed left ventricular apical ballooning * CXR [**9-5**]: RLL infiltrate, likely density seen on prior CT study * TTE [**9-8**]: normal LA; LV wall thickness, cavity size, and ejection fraction are normal (LVEF 60-70%); LV apex is hypokinetic (but not dyskinetic); no masses or thrombi in LV; no ventricular septal defect; normal RV; AV leaflets (3) mildly thickened but aortic stenosis not present; trace AR; MV leaflets mildly thickened; no MVP; mild MR; tricuspid valve leaflets mildly thickened; tricuspid valve prolapse present; moderate to severe [3+] TR; mild PA systolic hypertension; small pericardial effusion; no echocardiographic signs of tamponade .
* Cardiovascular: The patient underwent a cath that revealed a 70% proximal LAD stenosis, no sign of acute plague rupture.
Ventriculography revealed left ventricular apical hypokinesis with LVEF of 30%, suggesting takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
No intervention was done during the catheterization.
The patient was started on ASA 325 mg PO qd, which was changed to 81 mg qd then discontinued due to concern for a possible GI bleed.
An echocardiogram on hospital day 4 revealed LVEF of 60-70% with LV apical hypokinesis and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation.
She did not experience any chest pain or other symptoms.
On hospital day 2 she was extubated but experienced hypercapnic respiratory failure, secondary to her inability to protect her airway due to her motor neuron disease.
Her respiratory failure was thought due to her neuromuscular deterioration secondary to her ALS.
The patient received Fentanyl drip,  fentanyl patches, acetaminophen, and oxycodone for pain control.
She was found to be trace guiac positive on rectal exam.
Iron studies suggested anemia of chronic disease.
* FEN/Renal: Patient presented with low K, Mg, and Ca, most likely secondary to nutrional deficiency.
* Infection: The patient's initial WBC was elevated but trended down during her stay, likely reflecting a stress response.
Initial sputum culture grew out sparse, pan-sensitive Pseudomonas; initial blood and urine cultures were negative.
No empiric antibiotic was given initially; she was continued on ceftriaxone for possible neuro Lyme.
Heparin (Porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution Sig: One (1) SC INJECTION Injection TID (3 times a day): Subcutaneously for DVT prophylaxis.
Phenol-Phenolate Sodium 1.4 % Mouthwash Sig: One (1) Spray Mucous membrane  Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for throat pain.
Non - ischemic cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo) 2.
Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure, ventilator dependent .
Chronic pain 3.
C. difficile infection 4.
Urinary Tract Infection   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, hemodynamicallys stable.
Please return to the hospital if you experience fevers, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other symptoms that concern you.
