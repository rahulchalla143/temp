Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: -Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), [**2132-4-24**] -PICC line, [**2132-5-2**]   History of Present Illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 76318**] is a 74 year old woman with past medical history significant for rheumatoid arthritis (on chronic prednisone), asthma, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, presenting from rehab facilty after being found to have altered mental status and bright red blood per rectum.
Vitals on arrival 94/52, 83, 14, 98 F. Given her altered mental status, CT head was performed with preliminary read raising the question of a basal ganglia hemorrhage.
Patient was transferred for further management of suspected intracraneal hemorrhage.
Patient underwent repeat head CT which did not reveal any acute intracraneal process.
Labs repeated and given OSH elevation in liver enzymes and congestive pattern, CT abdomen was performed.
At this time, patient denies any pain or discomfort.
She is not accompanied by family and she reports feeling slightly confused.
Denies any chest pain, but reports some difficulty breathing.
Also reports single episode of vomiting earlier in the week with gastric contents and clear liquid.
She denied any light headedness or palipiations.
Family History: Sister with pancreatic cancer.

Small amount of new perihepatic free fluid.
No evidence of obstruction.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis and/or consolidation of the adjacent lung.
Calcified rounded lesion within the uterus, c/w calcified fibroid.
Bilateral renal hypodensities, too small to characterize, may reflect renal cysts.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is an abnormal systolic flow contour at rest, but no left ventricular outflow obstruction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic LV systolic dysfunction with an abnormal systolic flow contour without LVOT gradient.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
PICC Line placement [**2132-5-2**]: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided single-lumen PICC line placement via the right basilic venous approach.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs [**Known lastname 76318**] is a 74 year old woman with rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, hypertension, presenting from [**Hospital1 **] with question of basal gangia ICH, found not to have any intracraneal process but having abdominal pain, leukocytosis, bright red blood per rectum.
# MRSA Sepsis - Patient was initially admitted to the ICU with GI bleed and was quickly transitioned to the floor once her Hct was stable.
On the floor, GI planned for a colonoscopy, but during the prep, she triggered for hypotension, tachypnia with anxiety and altered mental status.
A TTE showed mildly thickened mitral valve, but no evidence of valvular vegitation.
The patient will follow up with Infectious Disease Clinic after her course of Vancomycin to monitor for recurrence of infection.
In addition to endocarditis, there remains a concern for potential seeding of her artifical joints (knees and hips).
# New Atrial fibrillation with RVR: During fluid resuscitation in the ICU, the patient developed a-fib with RVR in the setting of pressors.
# GI bleeding: She was initially sent to the ICU for a questionable history of melena, she had no melena during a period of observation and no significant HCT drop to suggest an upper GI bleed.
She did have bright red blood per rectum and on exam a rectal fissure and hemorrhoids.
In the ICU she underwent an EGD which revealed esophageal candidiasis.
She had possible proctitis on CT scan and treated with cipro flagyl.
On [**2132-5-6**] she received one unit of pRBC's for a HCT of 22.7 for symptommatic relief.
There was no evidence of continued bleeding at the time of discharge.
# Hyperbilirubinemia / elevated transaminases: The patient is status-post cholecystectomy, however this does not exclude intrabiliary obstruction.
She is negative Ab for autoimmune hepatitis, PSC, and viral hepatitis.
recently discontinued, chronic prednisone ??????
recently lowered) or possibly congestive hepatitis.
# [**Female First Name (un) 564**] Esophagitis: Seen on intial EGD - likely due to chronic prednisone.
# Arthritis, rheumatoid (RA): On prednisone 10mg daily at baseline.
Initially she presented on 40mg PO prednisone for question of COPD flare, and this was tapered in the setting of GI bleed.
Her steriods were transiently increased to stress doses in the ICU for possible adrenal insufficiency in the face of long standing steriod use, but once septic picture presented itself, prednisone was restarted at 5mg [**Hospital1 **].
# Hypertension:  Initially on telemetry the patient had short bursts of a long PR narrow complex tachycardia, likely causes are atrial tachycardia, AVRT or uncommon AVNRT.
Please avoid foley as this would be an additional source of potential infection.
# Leg pain: Likely due to anasarca and patient states it is new pain and not in ankle (ie- not due to RA).
Low dose opiate has been started though she is worried about somnolence with these medications.
