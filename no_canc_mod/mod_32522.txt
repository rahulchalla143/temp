Associated with some lightheadedness.
Denies HA, blurry vision, numbness, or weakness.
No CP or palpitations.
She stated that she has had similar symptoms of right-sided tingling in the recent past, but was not seen by a physician at that time.
One day prior to admission she was on the toilet having a BM when she passed out and was found by a family member with her head leaning on the wall.
She had no CP or palpitations prior to her fall, but it is unknown if there was head trauma.
During these episodes she would feel "startled .. as if electricity went through  her face .. as if she went far .. far away" but did not actually pass out or lose consciousness.
She is worried that these symptoms are due to a problem with her pacer as the generator was recently changed.
On [**3-4**], she had another episode of VT/VF at a rate of 250 beats per minute at 1:30 in the morning.
During her time in the ED she complained of episodes of right-sided tingling.

There are moderate, confluent hypodensities in the centra semiovale and periventricular white matter, consistent with sequelae of chronic small vessel disease.
There is no fracture or suspicious bony lesion.
There is no large scalp subgaleal hematoma.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.
CXR [**2128-3-30**] FINDINGS: There is severe cardiomegaly and moderate vascular congestion, but no pulmonary edema.
CXR [**2128-3-31**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increased in general lung density, likely to reflect pulmonary edema after cardiac failure.
Presence of a small pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
There is evidence of retrocardiac atelectasis.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax or other complication.
The transparency of the lung parenchyma has increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation.
There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pacer devices in place.
Retrocardiac opacification with obliteration of the hemidiaphragms consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion.
At the right base, there is some patchy area of increased opacification.
It is unclear whether this could represent some asymmetric pulmonary edema or a developing consolidation, especially since the upper part of the right heart border is not sharply seen.
EKGs [**2128-3-30**] Predominantly ventricular pacing with a pacing artifact falling at the end of what appears to be a P wave, but also several non-paced QRS complexes of at least two morphologies, one of which suggests a fusion beat.
Both the ventricular paced and non-paced QRS complexes have a left bundle-branch block, left axis deviation configuration.
ST segment flattening in leads I and aVL, with appropriate secondary repolarization abnormalities in the other leads on ventricularly paced beats.
Natively conducted and likely fusion ventricular complexes are new.
[**2128-3-31**] Ventricular pacing throughout falling on the end of what appears to be a P wave with thus very short interval between the P wave and the QRS complex.
Left atrial abnormality.
Previously noted ST segment flattening in leads I and aVL persist with no change in the appropriate secondary repolarization abnormalities in the other leads.
[**2128-4-2**] Sinus rhythm with atrial sensing and ventricular pacing.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2128-4-1**] there is no significant change.
Brief Hospital Course: 55F with Hx of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%) with BiV ICD (replaced generator on [**2128-2-26**]), progressive mitral regurgitation, HTN, HL, obesity, presenting with acute onset of tingling on the right side of her face and right arm, found to have had multiple firings of her ICD for VF/VT.
# VT/VT:  The patient's paceer interrogation showed multiple episodes of VF and VT and associated firing that most likely explain her symptoms of syncope, near-syncope, and right sided tingling.
The etiology of these arrhythmias was uncertain, although sarcoidosis is one possibility that could be investigated once she stabilizes.
# PUMP:  The patient is known to have severe nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with EF 25% with progressive MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], chronic systolic heart failure.
In [**2128-1-28**] she was admitted to this facilty with an acute heart failure exacerbation and her diuretics were increased.
# Chronic kidney disease:  baseline Cr 1.3-1.5, remained at baseline .
There is some slight swelling, no skin erythema or point tenderness.
# Elevation of PT, INR:  Persistent elevation of PT (15-16) and INR (1.3-1.4) since [**2123**], PTT normal.
No sign of liver disease.
[**Month (only) 116**] represent acquired factor inhibitor or low-level factor deficiency.
# GERD:  continued omeprazole .
Transitional Issues: - follow left heel pain - potential workup of elevated PTT - consider sarcoid workup for underlying etiology of arrhythmia, ACE level pending - please follow EKG for QTc prolongation given concurrent therapy with digoxin, amiodarone, and mexiletine.

This was caused by an irregular heart beat.
You were extubated successfully, and did not have further irregular beats.
We are not sure what caused this irregular heart beat.
We made the following changes to your medications: - START cefpodoxime for urinary tract infection (4 more days, last dose 4/14) - START amiodarone and mexiletine to control your heart rhythm - REDUCE your digoxin and valsartan doses, as these drugs can interact with amiodarone  Please follow-up with your physicians as listed below  Weigh yourself every morning, call your doctor if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
