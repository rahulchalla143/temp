He had experienced the same chest pain two days prior to admission transiently.
The patient attributed the chest pain to gas and bloating.
However, two days prior to admission, this episode of chest pain did not seem to be going away.
Was also associated with shortness of breath and one bout of emesis.
The patient then proceeded to an outside hospital Emergency Department, where he was found to have an inferior ST segment elevation MI.
He was started on Heparin, Integrilin, Plavix, and aspirin and sent to [**Hospital1 69**] for intervention.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father who passed from end-stage renal disease and a mother with diabetes type 2.

EKG obtained prior to catheterization shows normal sinus rhythm and a normal axis with ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF.
Right sided EKG shows no evidence of right ventricular infarct.
EKG following catheterization showed an irregular rhythm with a heart rate of 140 and resolution of the ST elevations.
He was found to have a right coronary artery occlusion which was stented.
During the procedure, he was noted to become bradycardic and received atropine at which time he went into supraventricular tachycardia.
He was also noted to have several brief episodes of ventricular tachycardia overnight likely due to reperfusion ischemia.
The patient had one episode of pleuritic chest pain the morning following cardiac catheterization which resolved with Morphine.
The patient was chest pain free throughout the remainder of the hospitalization.
