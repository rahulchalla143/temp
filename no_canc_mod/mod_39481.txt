COAG NEG STAPH does NOT require contact precautions, regardless of resistance.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Abbreviated work-up performed Isolate(s) identified and       susceptibility testing performed because of concomitant positive       blood culture(s) Comparison of the susceptibility patterns may be       helpful to assess clinical significance.
COAG NEG STAPH does NOT require contact precautions, regardless of resistance.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
RSR' pattern in lead V1 and QR complex in lead V2 with Q waves across the precordium.
The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and the patient's right neck and right upper chest were prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.
The indwelling hemodialysis catheter was removed and a new 15.5 French tunneled hemodialysis catheter with 19 cm tip-to-cuff length was advanced over the wire.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications.
IMPRESSION: Successful replacement of tunneled dialysis catheter with a new 15.5 French tunneled hemodialysis catheter, 19 cm tip-to-cuff in length via right internal jugular vein, its tip is positioned at the right atrium.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the apical third of the left ventricle with focal dyskinesis of the apex.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
LUE U/S ([**4-11**]): Focused scanning in the left upper extremity in the region of the patient's known AV graft demonstrates no focal fluid collection or secondary signs of abscess.
Color and pulsed wave Doppler analysis of the graft demonstrates no evidence for flow.
Echogenic thrombus is seen throughout the graft on grayscale son[**Name (NI) 1417**].
Complete thrombosis of the left upper extremity AV graft.
No evidence of fluid collection/abscess in the surrounding soft tissues.
Brief Hospital Course: # Hypertensive urgency: The patient presented with a blood pressure of 229/56 and EKG showing old ST elevations in V1-V4, ST elevations more significantly in II, and decreased more significantly in aVR.
He had a brief episode of hypotension after hemodialysis, but his pressures then normalized.
# Gastroparesis: The patient's symptoms of nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain are consistent with underlying gastroparesis.
He has presented with similar symptoms during his recent admissions.
He has been seen previously by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in GI (most recently in [**5-20**]), who indicated that he has had multiple past gastric emptying studies which have shown severe delay in emptying.
He has found some symptomatic improvement with dietary modifications such as frequent small meals, liquid nutrients and avoiding [**Doctor First Name **] foods and those containing high fiber.
The patient's nausea/vomiting and pain were controlled with Ativan, Dilaudid, and Zofran.
He was scheduled an outpatient GI appointment to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to address his gastroparesis and for consideration of G tube and J tube.
# Coag negative Staph bacteremia: The patient has had intermittent blood and catheter cultures positive for Coag negative Staph since [**2186-11-30**].
He had an exchange of his right IJ tunneled dialysis catheter in IR on [**4-6**] due to persistent bacteremia.
Surveillance blood cultures from [**4-8**], [**4-10**], and [**4-12**] showed no growth.
In order to work up the potential nidus of his bacteremia, he had a LUE ultrasound to evaluate his old HD graft, which showed complete thrombosis of the left upper extremity AV graft and no evidence of fluid collection/abscess in the surrounding soft tissues.
A TTE on this admission showed no vegetations.
ID was consulted and recommended obtaining a [**Month/Year (2) **] to rule out abscess or vegetation.
However, since the patient has a reported history of esophageal erosion and [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear, Cardiology requested GI clearance prior to the [**Doctor Last Name **].
# ESRD on HD: Renal followed the patient for HD while he was hospitized.
He is a high risk transplant candidate given his gastroparesis, but they do recommend proceeding with transplantation given his previous difficulties with HD access.
Cardiology was consulted, but will not comment on clearance until his gastroparesis and hypertension are under better control.
ECG in ED was concerning for persistent ST elevations.
Cardiology was consulted and felt that the ECG was not concerning for a new cardiac event.
TTE showed severe symmetric LVH, LVEF 50% secondary to hypokinesis of the apical third of the left ventricle with focal dyskinesis of the apex, and no definite vegetations seen.
The renal transplant outpatient team had asked Cardiology to give clearance prior to transplant, however Cardiology will not comment on clearance until his gastroparesis and hypertension are under better control.
# Type 1 DM: Continued Glargine 5 U qhs and RISS.
His AMS was thought to be secondary to the Ativan/Dilaudid that he has been getting for his gastroparesis.
Hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every six (6) hours as needed for pain (do not give for nausea/vomiting).
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Hypertensive Urgency Coagulase negative Staph Bacteremia End-stage Renal Disease on HD Diabetes mellitus Type 1 Gastroparesis .
SECONDARY: CAD s/p STEMI  Discharge Condition: Left AMA  Discharge Instructions: The patient left AMA.
He was given a printed list of his current medication regimen, and instructed to return to the ED if he had any symptoms that concerned him  Followup Instructions: You missed a Cardiology appointment while you were hospitalized.
