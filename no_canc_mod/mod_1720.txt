HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old Russian- speaking gentleman with recent admissions for multilobar pneumonia, recently discharged from [**Hospital1 **] on [**6-5**], now being readmitted for hypotension presumed to be septic.
The patient has had three recent admits to [**Hospital6 12826**] with a question of multilobar pneumonia for which he has grown out Stenotrophomonas in his sputum which has been ruled out for AFB on multiple occasions due to a right upper lobe cavitary lesion.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] on [**5-26**] for further management and here he was started on a ten day course of vancomycin/meropenem for a cavitary pneumonia although sputum cultures were largely negative.
His course was complicated by a COPD flare of which he was treated with a prednisone taper and a mild episode of CHF after fluid resuscitation and also C. diff.
He has had mild increased coughing and sputum production and actually had been ambulating with PT and taking good PO's.
On the day of admission, he developed some mild lightheadedness and was noted to have hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 60's to 70's, not responsive to 1500 cc of IV fluid.
Currently, he denies any shortness of breath other than notes some mild productive cough with some green sputum.
He also notes some pleuritic chest pain.
He has no abdominal pain, diarrhea or dysuria.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  CAD, status post CABG three years ago, unclear of results of anatomy of CABG and also reports having a cath in [**2181**] with also unknown results.
Status post prostate surgery.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
He has no industrial environmental exposures.
In terms of functional status, he was quite active prior to recent pneumonias but now living in [**Hospital **] Rehab.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, he is afebrile at 96.9.
In general, he is very pleasant and comfortable in no respiratory distress.
His lungs show diffuse wheezing and decreased air with bilateral rhonchi.
Extremities show bilateral ankle edema at 1+.
He had a chest x-ray on admission showing persistent right upper lobe opacity with question of a possible pneumonia when compared to prior chest films.
His sputum ultimately grew out Stenotrophomonas, pen- resistant with only intermediate sensitivity to Levaquin.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Cardiovascular:  The patient initially came in hypotensive and with increased lactate level was treated empirically for sepsis.
Although the patient was treated for presumed sepsis, later on it was slightly unclear as to the etiology of the patient's hypotension and whether the patient was truly septic as blood cultures and urine cultures remained negative and sputum grew back bacteria only later on during his hospital course.
Other sources for hypotension were sought after including cortisol levels which were normal.
He ruled out for an MI by cardiac enzymes and then later had an echocardiogram initially to rule out pericardial effusion but which did show a new depressed ejection fraction of 25-30 percent compared with previous values of an ejection fraction of approximately 40 percent.
Later during the hospital course, the patient initially came in in sinus rhythm and on EKG developed rapid atrial flutter into the 150's.
Given the fact that his ejection fraction had decreased with signs of cardiomyopathy consistent with rate related tachycardia, one of the concerns was that the patient had become hypotensive in the setting of rapid rates.
Furthermore, it was felt that the patient did have a large component of CHF as the patient had been aggressively fluid resuscitated.
Therefore, although the exact etiology of the patient's hypotension is unclear, it is now felt that CHF played a large role in this.
Ultimately, it was decided that the patient, given his old age and likely risk of possible bleeding or falls, would not be an ideal candidate for anticoagulation but would optimize the goal for rate control.
Meanwhile, he will be continued on his aspirin and statins for his coronary artery disease.
Pulmonary:  The patient initially was admitted hypotensive and only slightly increased oxygen demands from his new baseline since his multiple hospitalizations this Spring.
Again, as mentioned above, it is unclear as to the exact time frame and mechanism of the patient's hypotension and respiratory compromise.
However, the primary team did not feel that this was clearly an etiology for respiratory failure.
It is thought that he may have a possible component of aspiration leading to his respiratory failure.
There is the feeling from the team taking care of him that he did not actually have a pneumonia during his hospitalization.
However, given his severe structural disease and his cavitary lesion, he would benefit from alternating prophylactic antibiotic regimens with Bactrim and amoxicillin to try and decrease his bacterial pathogen load.
He also has been on a slow steroid taper of prednisone for COPD which was started on his last hospitalization.
GI:  As mentioned above, the patient has a recent history of C. diff.
Given his high white count on admission (although his white count is chronically elevated) and still having some loose stools, C. diff.
As mentioned above, the patient is likely at large risk for aspiration and should take PO's with extreme caution.
Renal Failure:  The patient came in with acute renal insufficiency.
Initially, given the patient's hypertension, the patient was felt to be mildly dehydrated and his creatinine did improve with aggressive IV fluid resuscitation.
Also, given his old age and thought to be at risk for subsequent bleeding secondary to falls or possible hemorrhaging, it was decided not to anticoagulate the patient for his atrial fibrillation/flutter but to try to contain him in sinus rhythm.
This was felt to be possibly secondary to malnutrition and the patient will receive Vitamin K for this.
Finally, the patient has had a slight downward trend of his platelet count during the last several days.
His thyroid studies suggest possible hypothyroidism with a decreased free T4.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Atrial fibrillation/flutter with rapid ventricular response, now resolving.
Acute renal insufficiency.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on steroid taper.
Steroid induced hyperglycemia.
Persistent Clostridium difficile colitis.
