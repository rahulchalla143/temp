A TTE/TEE were negative for vegetations.
Of note, while at the OSH he did have an episode of coffee ground emesis for which an EGD was performed and showed erosion in the antrum, duodenum and stomach.

A bronchoscopy was performed on [**2172-1-11**] which showed significant tracheobronchial malacia involving the distal trachea, right and left main stem bronchus.

[**2172-1-11**] CXR - Likely mild-to-moderate fluid overload and retrocardiac air space opacity, atelectasis versus developing pneumonia.
Although potentially due to a structure external to the patient, a small aspirated tooth or other foreign body should also be considered.
Micro: [**2172-1-11**] Blood - pending [**2172-1-11**] Sputum - 2+ GPC, 2+ GNR; culture growing spare staph aureus and rare GNR   Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 61-year-old gentleman with obesity, DM, CAD, Hyperlipidemia who was transferred from an OSH because of difficulty weaning from ventilator support after developing MRSA pneumonia.
# TRACHEOBRONCHOMALACIA/RESPIRATORY FAILURE - Patient was intubated on 3 occasions at OSH; most recently re-intubated on [**2172-1-6**].
A bronchoscopy revealed tracheobronchomalacia and he had a Y stent placed in the OR on [**2172-1-13**].

# VAP MRSA PNEUMONIA - has been on vancomycin for MRSA PNA since [**2172-1-2**] (started at OSH) due to fever and secretions.
# HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA: The patient's platelets dropped early in his admission and he was found to be HIT +.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION - currently rate controlled on metoprolol 25 TID.
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA - continue statin .
# AGITATION - The patient has required intermittent haldol and ativan for agitiation and pulling at lines while inpatient.
# DM - Patient was maintained on insulin sliding scale .
# PICC - Patient had PICC placed in R arm on [**2172-1-20**] for antibiotics and Argatroban.
Ipratropium-Albuterol 18-103 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Six (6) Puff Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Haloperidol Lactate 5 mg/mL Solution Sig: Five (5) mg Injection [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for agitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Tracheobronchomalacia GNR PNA MRSA PNA A Fib   Discharge Condition: Stable, on minimal vent settings   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you had a prolonged intubation after a servere PNA.
You developed a condition termed tracheobronchomalacia which makes breathing difficult.
You completed a 14 day course of vancomycin for a MRSA pneumonia on [**2172-1-16**].
you also developed a condition called HIT.
You were started on  argatroban, which is a blood thinner and you are being transitioned to coumadin.
Note to rehab: Argatroban falsely elevates INR so at rehab, when his INR is between [**5-3**], his argatroban should be held for 4 hours and an INR should then be checked.
