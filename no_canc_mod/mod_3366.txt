History of Present Illness: 51 yo man with DM, HTN, LE claudication, presenting with worsening dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea for approximately 2 weeks, found to have elevated BNP and TropT 0.4 with CXR suggestive of pulmonary edema in ED, who developed worsening dyspnea after receiving contrast for CT to r/u PE.
For two weeks, patient had 3-4 episodes of difficulty breathing and chest tightness at night, some dyspnea on exertion, and general malaise.
The chest tightness at night was diffuse with no radiation, diaphoresis, or nausea, and resolved along with the difficulty breathing when he stood up and used his inhaler.
He has also noticed productive cough with clear non-bloody sputum for the past two weeks which has been worsening.
Went to PCP after sx acutely worsened and was found to have low sats and sinus tach, for which he was sent to ED for PE work up.
In the ED, EKG wnl, trop 0.4, CXR showed pulmonary edema but he was persistently tachycardic so CT PE was done.
After lying down and getting contrast for the CTA, he developed worsening dyspnea with desatting to 80s.
He received nitro gtt and 60 of lasix for concern of flash edema, and benadryl/solumedrol for questionable allergic reaction.
He continued to have SOB so he was put on CPAP/100% FiO2.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
He endorses calf pain bilaterally when walking for more than half a mile, which resolves with rest, and has been present for approximately 6 months.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Diabetes, Hypertension, myocardial infarction 2.
no oral lesions NECK: Supple, CARDIAC: limited by CPAP, Regular rhythm, tachycardic LUNGS: diffuse expiratory wheezes bilaterally, coarse breath sounds bilaterally with scattered rhonchi worse on the right ABDOMEN: Soft, NT,ND.
No HSM or tenderness.
+ BS EXTREMITIES: No pedal edema, intact femoral pulses SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated three vessel disease.
The LAD had diffuse disease with subtotal occlusion after D1.
There was slow flow throughout the LAD system.
The Cx system had a mid vessel ulcerated 80% stenosis before OM2.
The OM1 had diffuse disease throughout and a proximal 90% stenosis.
The RCA had an ostial 80% stenosis and was a small vessel with diffuse disease throughout.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 18 mmHg and a PCWP of 35 mmHg.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior and septal walls and hypokinesis of the inferior and lateral walls.
Depressed right ventricular function.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
No thoracic aortic dissection is seen.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior and septal walls.
Severe right ventricular dysfunction.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
The appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable including moderate cardiomegaly and mild dilatation of the mediastinum.
There is interval improvement of the vascular congestion which is currently minimal.
Small left pleural effusion is present, most likely minimally increased compared to prior radiograph.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
DR. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2618**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2619**]   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 9975**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2135-9-2**] for workup of his shortness of breath and chest discomfort.
He had evidence of pulmonary edema with elevated BNP at 2164 and TropT 0.4, most suggestive of acute heart failure likely secondary to recent ischemic event.
ECHO was done and demonstrated extensive left ventricular regional dysfunction consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease.
He remained intubated and sedated for several days to recover from his myocardial infarction and surgery.
