STUDIES: ========= CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2116-1-2**] IMPRESSION: 1) No fracture or malalignment in the cervical spine.
No acute intracranial process.
Minimally displaced nasal bone fractures bilaterally.
There are markedly low lung volumes with resultant atelectasis.
No definite consolidation seen.
The NG tube tip terminates at the gastroesophageal junction with the sidehole in the distal esophagus and should be advanced for at least 15 cm.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with still prominent azygos vein and dilated right upper mediastinal vessels although the overall bilateral perihilar opacities have improved suggesting resolution of pulmonary edema.
Minimal left perihilar haziness demonstrated on the left with continuation towards the left lower lobe is most likely representing residual changes.
There is no evidence of significant amount of pleural fluid, although small pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
RIB BILAT, W/AP CHEST  [**2116-1-4**] IMPRESSION: Left 10th and right 9th lateral rib deformities favoring old healed fractures.
No definite acute fracture and no pneumothorax.
male with history of depression who was found unresponsive outside with EtOH intoxication and respiratory depression.
# EtOH intoxication and dependence: The patient presented with a significant blood alcohol level accompanied with respiratory depression.
He was intubated for airway protection and respiratory depression given his minimal responsiveness on exam.
He does endorse going through the "shakes" but is unsure if he has ever had withdrawal seizures.
# Hypotension: The patient was found to be persistently hypotensive with SBPs in 70-80 after admission to the MICU.
Initially, it was thought to be in the setting of receiving a bolus of sedation, but his hypotension persisted after sedation was weaned down.
He was covered empirically for infection with vancomycin and Zosyn, but this was quickly stopped, after his blood pressures normalized.
He remained afebrile during his hospitalization.
# Depression: The patient has a history of depression that was treated with Lexapro and Seroquel in the past.
He stated that these medications helped him, but he has not been able to refill these medications as he has no health insurance.
He did not endorse active suicidal or homicidal ideation.
# Abdominal pain: The patient has had this chronically, and it is unsure if has had a GI workup as he is a poor historian and gets care from multiple hospitals.
No intervention needed.
# Macrocytic Anemia: Most likely [**2-22**] alcoholism.
