The patient is nonverbal, but her husband provides the history of two days of upper respiratory symptoms including coughing, wheezing, sounding congested but with no sputum production.
She was advised by her primary care physician's coverage to try mucinex for secretions, but this did not help, and she developed a low grade temperature to 99 or 100 at home.
She became more short of breath as noticed by her husband, and was seen by [**Name (NI) 269**] on [**6-7**] and advised to go to the ER.
pituitary adenoma 4) Osteoporosis 5) Admit [**1-2**] urosepsis c/b respiratory failure with prolonged wean requiring tracheostomy  Social History: The patient lives at home with her husband, who is her primary caretaker.
Family History: Father with myocardial infarction.
Physical Exam: Physical Exam: Vitals: T: P: R: BP: SaO2: General: Awake, alert, and cooperative with exam in no acute distress.
HEENT: Normocephalic, no scleral icterus noted, clear oropharynx with moist mucus membranes Neck: supple, with no JVD or carotid bruits appreciated Pulmonary: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes, rhonchi or rales Cardiac: regular rate and rhythm, with no murmurs Abdomen: soft, nontender, with normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Extremities: Warm with no edema and good pulses throughout Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
No ptosis is noted, extra-ocular muscles were intact with saccadic movements; 3-4 beats nystagmus bilaterally far gaze.
Motor: bilateral hand tremor and left leg tremor visible when limbs lifted by observer.
Unable to assess for drift.
Bilateral deltoid atrophy.
No obvious fasiculations.
Sensory: Patient winces and blinks eyes once (meaning "yes") to pain in all four extremities  Coordination: Normal finger to nose and heel to shin, with no dysmetria.
No dysdiadochokinesia noted on rapid alternating hand movements or finger tapping.
Limited, abnormal study.
There is electrophysiologic evidence for a generalized dysfunction of motor fibers but this limited study cannot adequately discriminate between a process involving motor nerves or muscles.
Probable inflammatory/allergic abnormalities in paranasal and mastoid sinuses, as noted above.
NOTE: There is prominent cerebellar and brainstem atrophy.
The prominent electromyographic finding is one of generalized poor activation, consistent with the patient's known central nervous system disorder.
CXR ([**6-23**]): Bilateral moderate pleural effusions that are stable.
Brief Hospital Course: CC:[**CC Contact Info 100324**] HPI: 54 yoF w/ for multisystem atrophy transferred from OSH with pneumonia and hypoxia, admitted to Neuro step dow unit.
The patient is nonverbal, but her husband provides the history of two days of upper respiratory symptoms including non-productive cough and wheezing, followed by low grade fever (99-100).
On [**6-7**] she developed worsening shortness of breath and was advised by [**Month/Year (2) 269**] to go to ED, where T 102.1 EMS took her to [**Hospital 100325**] hospital, where she received Vanco, Azithro, Levaquin, and two doses of Zosyn before being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**6-8**].
At baseline, she is wheelchair-bound for the past year and one half, and nonverbal except for an occasional word (ie, saying "okay.").
She was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and transferred to the MICU.
FUNGURIA  MICRO: CDIF (-) X 1, SPUT [**6-14**], [**6-19**] (mrsa), [**6-21**] (GPC 2+), BLD 7/16/17/18 (-), URINE >100K YEAST) RAD ([**6-22**]):  CXR slight decrease in left pleural effusion, right stable.
no new inflitrate  SUMMARY:  15 DAY hospital course,  54 yoF w/ multisystem atrophy presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure likely secondary to multifocal pneumonia superimposed on chronic respiratory acidosis in the setting of hypoventilation.
Stabilized early in course put proved difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation secondary to periodic apnea and indicated by poor NIF scores.
1) Hypercarbic respiratory failure: likely [**12-31**] multifocal pneumonia (CAP vs aspiration) superimposed on chronic respiratory acidosis in the setting of hypoventilation.
Changed to vancomycin with MRSA positive sputum.
- Urinary legionella Ag negative; blood, urine clx negative - alb/atr MDI standing and PRN throughout hospitalization - Vancomycin-> completed 10 day course for MRSA pneumonia .

Sinus CT [**6-15**] with fluid in mastoids bilaterally, potential for mastoiditis; Treated per ENT recommendations with meropenam x 7 days.
- concern for loculated pleural effusions; unable to find tappable pocket - bilateral LENI negative - [**6-9**] ucx grew resistant klebsiella pneumoniae; although subsequent ucx have been negative.
EMG c/w shy-[**Last Name (un) **], no other abnormalities seen.
4) Chronic constipation: large amount of stool in bowel.
Chronic constipation in setting of Shy [**Last Name (un) 16294**].
