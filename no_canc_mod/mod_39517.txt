A tiny focus of hemorrhage may not be visualized in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle suggestive of redistribution.
No new hemorrhage or shift in midline structures.
Right parietal subgaleal hematoma with associated laceration and staples overlying.
[**2-18**] LENIs: no evidence of DVT in b/l LE .
[**2-19**] CXR: Low lung volumes persist.
Bibasilar atelectasis larger on the left are unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Left subcutaneous emphysema has improved.
[**2-21**] Abd CT: No evidence of infection in chest, abdomen, and pelvis, to account for the patient's fever.
The study is not tailored for evaluation of pulmonary embolism; however, within this limitation, filling defects in left lower lobar and segmental arteries, is concerning for pulmonary embolus.
Extensive thoracic and abdominal pelvic fractures, with interval fixation of pelvic fractures in near anatomic alignment.
New mild widening of the right sacroiliac joint.
Known right renal lacerations, with mild interval decrease in the hematoma in the perinephric space.
No new interval intra-abdominal or pelvic bleed.
[**2-23**] Chest PTA r/o PE: Intraluminal filling defects c/w pulmonary emboli are visualized in distal left lower lobe pulmonary artery and extend into anteromedial, lateral and posterior basal segmental pulmonary arteries.
No evidence of right heart strain.
He regained pulses before losing them approximately 10 minutes later, and was coded for an additional amount of time prior to regaining his pulses and remaining stable thereafter with several units of blood and crystalloid being infused.
His FAST was negative and he was noted to have an open fracture of his right distal humerus as well as pelvic instability.
There was concern for urethral injury and a catheter was not placed at this time.
Given persistent hemodynamic instability he was sent to the Angio suite with interventional radiology where they embolized the bilateral internal iliacs with Gelfoam.
Stable, he was taken to radiology for further radiologic workup revealing the following injuries:  Left intraparenchymal hemorrhage basal ganglia Posterior scalp laceration Right parietal subgaleal hematoma Right distal humerus and olecranon fractures Right renal lacerations with subcapsular hematoma Right posterior 11th rib fracture L2-4 transverse process fracture Right iliac crest fracture Bilateral superior and inferior pubic rami fractures Left SI joint diastasis  He was taken to the or on [**2139-2-16**] by the orthopedic team for ORIF right hip/acetabular fracture as well as I&D and ex-fix of his right elbow.
His hospital course by systems as follows:  Neuro: Neurosurgery was consulted early on due to his brain injuries - seizure prophylaxis was started, serial exams and head CT scans were followed as well.
His sedation was weaned for extubation on [**2-19**] and he was treated with IV Dilaudid for pain control.
He was mildly confused after extubation.
Given his altered mental status his cervical-collar was not able to be cleared at first.
As his mental status improved we were able to obtain an adequate physical exam and removed the cervical collar.
He was started on Trazodone at HS to help regulate his sleep/wake cycle given his brain injury and this has seemed to help.
Resp: Initially placed chest tubes were removed on [**2-17**] (right side) and [**2-18**] (left) without complication.
He had no pneumo or hemothorax.
After transfer to the floor on [**2-20**] he was transferred back to the ICU on [**2-21**] for respiratory distress and for a fever.
CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis did not reveal an obvious source of fever but he was placed in the ICU, antibiotics were broadened and he recovered well.
On re-review, radiology could not exclude a pulmonary embolism in the left lower lobe.
This was followed with a CTA on [**2-23**] which confirmed this finding in the left lower lobe basilar segments and he was started on a heparin drip.
He was also noted to have a right sided renal laceration and subcapsular hematoma.
ID: He maintained on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage (Ancef/Levo/Flagyl) for his open fractures and after placement of orthopedic hardware given high risk of infection.
He is afebrile and his WBC on [**3-3**].
He was started on a heparin drip on [**2-23**] to treat a pulmonary embolism in the left lower lobe basal segments.
MSK: He has an external fixation on his right arm and is non weightbearing.
He is also non weight bearing on his lower extremities due to his pelvic fractures.
Follow up films of his pelvis due to complaints of increased pelvic pain were done on [**3-4**] to assess the hardware and it was noted that there were no issues.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p Motor vehicle crash Injuries: Left intraparenchymal hemorrhage basal ganglia Posterior scalp laceration Right parietal subgaleal hematoma Right distal humerus and olecranon fractures Right renal lacerations with subcapsular hematoma Right posterior 11th rib fracture L2-4 transverse process fracture Right iliac crest fracture Bilateral superior and inferior pubic rami fractures Left SI joint diastasis Pulmonary embolus   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You also developed a blood clot in your lung over the course of your hospital stay requiring treatment with a blood thinner called wafarin (Coumadin) - you will be on this medication at least for 6 months and possibly longer.
