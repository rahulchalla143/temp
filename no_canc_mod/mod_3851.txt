Admission Date:  [**2157-5-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2157-5-8**]   Service:  ACOVE-MEDICINE HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86 year old gentleman presenting from the [**Hospital3 **] facility for altered mental status described as "lethargy" times approximately four days, as well as question of worsening anemia.
The pupils were felt to be minimally reactive.
The patient in the Emergency Department became increasingly awake and alert, status post dosing of Narcan although it Emergency Department was negative for narcotics.
He stated he had been somewhat short of breath approximately seven days ago but had not experienced the symptoms since that time.
The patient is reported to have had an episode of decrease in blood pressure on [**2157-5-2**], at the [**Hospital3 **] Center.
He does have a recent history of discharge from the [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2157-4-30**], for anemia and transient renal insufficiency.
Additionally, please note that the patient had a recent admission to the [**Hospital1 69**] between [**2157-4-13**], and [**2157-4-16**], for atrial fibrillation with hospital course complicated by an exaggerated response to Lopressor producing unresponsiveness and hypotension, noting that the patient's vital signs in the Emergency Department at this admission were stable at a heart rate of 75, blood pressure 122/90, respiratory rate 20, and pulse oximetry 97% on four liters.
Depression with psychotic features with a history of a suicide attempt.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of atrial fibrillation.
History of C. difficile.
History of loculated pericardial effusion with pericarditis.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Department, afebrile at 98.4, pulse 74, blood pressure 144/63, respiratory rate 12, 97% in room air and 100% on four liters.
There was 1+ edema bilaterally.
There was a question of jugular venous distention but the pulsus was 4 to 5 (not elevated).
There was noted to be poor dentition.
Cardiac examination was unremarkable with regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs were noted.
There were dry crackles at the bases, right greater than the left, and otherwise the patient was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
There is no edema noted.
Urine was negative for urinary tract infection.
Head CT was performed on [**2157-5-6**], with the following impression:  "No acute intracranial pathology, brain atrophy".
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with the above complaints with having received doses of Narcan in the Emergency Department.
Although the toxicology screen was negative for narcotics, the patient's mental status improved markedly although there was no clear cause and effect relationship for this change.
His creatinine was noted to be elevated to 1.5 and the patient was gently hydrated with 750 ccs of normal saline overnight with a resultant decrease in the patient's creatinine to 0.9 the day following admission, noting that the patient's mouth had been quite dry at the time of admission and it was moist on the morning following admission.
The etiology of the patient's mental status change observed in the Emergency Department  with stable vital signs and unclear precipitant of resolution at this time is still unclear, but possibilities are felt to include dehydration which has now been corrected, the possibility of narcotic ingestion responding to Narcan, the patient's psychiatric or neurologic problems including depression or [**Name (NI) 5895**] disease although Parkinson's disease the Sinemet has not recently changed.
Head CT was performed as noted above to rule out acute intracranial pathology including bleeding.
Additionally, please note that the geriatric fellow raised the possibility of seizure although the patient is not reported to have had positive phenomenon including tonoclonic movements or eye movements consistent with seizure during the period of unresponsiveness.
Altered mental status possibly secondary to dehydration or other factors yet to be determined.
The patient should not have increased beta blocker without close supervision including frequent blood pressure monitoring and neurologic checks as he has a history of unresponsiveness and hypotension because of sensitivity to beta blockade although he is stable on his current dosing.
The patient should be closely monitored for signs of dehydration and creatinine should be checked q.d.
for one week versus signs for volume overload including pulse oxygenation measured b.i.d.
and on examination as the patient may either need additional hydration or diuretic to insure that he does not begin to become dehydrated, nor does he have worsening of his pulmonary status.
