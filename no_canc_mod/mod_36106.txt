IMAGING: CTA: FINDINGS: There is adequate opacification of the pulmonary arterial tree.
The main pulmonary artery is enlarged, measuring up to 3.0 cm, and there are extensive pulmonary emboli, including a large saddle embolus and additional emboli extending into both the right and left main pulmonary arteries and peripheral pulmonary arterial tree.
There is no associated pulmonary infarct.
However, there is evidence of right heart strain, including dilation of the right atrium and right ventricle, leftwardbowing of the interventricular septum, and reflux of contrast into the IVC and hepatic veins.
There is no evidence of acute aortic syndrome.
There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
There is no pericardial effusion or pleural effusion.
There is atelectasis medially at the right lung base.
There is no evidence of pneumonia.
There is no pulmonary nodule or mass identified.
In the included upper abdomen, there is a single hypodensity within the left lobe of the liver, too small to characterize, though likely a cyst.
There is no acute intra-abdominal process identified.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions identified concerning for malignancy.
Massive saddle pulmonary emboli, extending into both the right and left main pulmonary arteries and all aspects of the pulmonary arterial tree.
Evidence of right heart strain, including dilation of the right atrium and right ventricle and bowing of the interventricular septum.
No evidence of pulmonary infarct.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with severe systolic dysfunction.
Severe functional tricuspid regurgitation.
At least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
CXR: FINDINGS: Right lower lung atelectasis and minimal right pleural effusion are no different from prior radiograph dated [**2152-8-13**].
Mild vascular engorgement is similar to the prior radiograph.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
No new lung opacities of concern.
IMPRESSION: Since [**2152-8-13**], the right minimal pleural effusion and lower lung atelectasis are unchanged.
63 year old female with h/o HIV on HAART (CD4 1049) and recent L5-S1 fusion 3 weeks prior to admission who presented with hypotension and experienced cardiac arrest while in the ED, found to have massive PE.
# Massive PE with hypotension/shock: PE occurred in post-op setting.
Also had some demand ischemia with elevated cardiac enzymes that trended down afterwards.
TTE showed global RV dilation/disfunction and severe TR w/ preserved LVEF.
#Altered Mental Status: There was concern during the admission on the medicine floor that the patient had acutely developed altered mental status.
Despite being afebrile without a leukocytosis, an infectios work-up was repeated.
# Anemia: Hct had trended down from 29 on admission to 25 at present.
She required no trasnfusions.
She remains hemodynamically stable, with no evidence of active bleeding at present.
She did have some mild oozing from OGT while in ICU, and she was started on ranitidine out of concern for GI bleed.
# Transaminitis: During the admission, AST as high as [**2140**] and ALT in 700s.
While the patient does have h/o HBV and HCV, acute rise was likely secondary to shock liver versus hepatic congestion in setting of severe RV failure.
# Elevated troponin: Trop peaked at 1.11 and has since trended down.
TTE showed dilated RV with severe systolic dysfunction.
Cardiology was consulted and felt her rhythm was from an irritable focus secondary to her ventricular remodeling in the presence of her massive pulmonary embolism.
# Complicated Urinary Tract Infection: Patient with fever of 100.4 on day prior to admission to the medicine floor.
No clear source of infection, as no consolidation on recent CXR; blood cultures remain negative to date.
No leukocytosis.
On day of discharge, the patient's urine culture returned showing enterococcus in the urine susceptible to ampicillin, macrobid, and vancomycin.
If her urine analysis returns suggestive of urinary tract infection, send a urine culture and consider starting the patient on vancomycin.
# Recent L4-S1 spinal surgery: No acute surgical issues at present.
[**Month (only) 116**] have been secondary to hypoxia veresus acidosis from massive PE and shock.
No evidence of seizure activity this admission, and no prior history of seizure.
Infectious work-up negative to date, with negative urine culture, no PNA on CXR, and blood cultures negative to date.
# Constipation: Aggressive bowel regimen with colace, senna, miralax and bisacodyl.
# Pain control: Patient had pleuritic chest pain secondary to chest compressions done during ACLS in the emergency department.
Her pain was controlled with Tramadol 50mg 1-2 tablets every 6 hours as needed for pain.
CHRONIC ISSUES: .
# Hepatitis B: Home ARV was continued through the admission.
# HTN: SBP elevated in 140s-150s.
Her pressures remained elevated and thus her home lisinopril was increased to 10mg daily.
Her home metoprolol was discontinued in the setting of idioventricular rhythm.
-Patient will need to be on 100mg nitrofurantoin orally twice daily for 14 days for urinary tract infection.
If her urine analysis returns suggestive of urinary tract infection, send a urine culture and consider starting the patient on vancomycin.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Pulmonary embolism  Secondary diagnosis: HIV HBV HCV Hypertension s/p recent L4-S1 spinal surgery Complicated urinary tract infection   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were hospitalized because of a massive Pulmonary Embolism (a large blood clot in your lungs).
While on warfarin, you are at increased risk of bleeding.
If you notice severe bleeding, including rectal bleeds, bleeding from the urethra, or nosebleeds, contact your physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] is important that if you suffer a fall or traumatic injury while taking warfarin that you call your doctor or report to the emergency room for evaluation to make sure you are not bleeding internally.
