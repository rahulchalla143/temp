Pt reports 2-3 days of dizziness and "wooziness" during which he has been unable stand w/o feeling that he would fall over.
He denies loosing consciousness during either event but does recall hitting his head both times (on his forehead).
Later in the morning he was unable to get out of bed and had to be helped by his [**Hospital3 12272**] personnel due to generalized weakness (L>R).
Shortly after arrival, pt became severely agitated and received 1mg of Haldol prior to being evaluated by neurosurgery.
Family History: No strokes or brain bleeds.
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM: O: T: 97.6 BP: 145/71  HR: 98 R 20 100% RA Gen: WD/WN, agitated, pulling at blankets and moving R arm restlessly HEENT: Small (2x2cm) abrasion over forehead and 1cm abrasion over nose bridge otherwise normocephalic (no bruises or swelling over posterior scalp).
Language: Speech fluent with moderate comprehension (pt w/ difficulty raising L hand if asked but if demonstrated is able to) otherwise able to follow simple commands with RUE w/ some help.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Pt able to move L shoulder and occasionally L elbow with noxious stimulus.
No pronator drift in R.

No evidence of underlying vascular anomaly, no evidence of active contrast extravasation.
The location and adjacent subarachnoid hemorrhage are most suggestive of cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
However, continued followup is advised to more definitively exclude an underlying mass, which could be obscured by blood products and adjacent edema.
MRI Head [**1-2**]: IMPRESSION: Limited exam demonstrating right parietal parenchymal hemorrhage as seen on CT, not further characterized.
CT Head [**1-2**]: IMPRESSION: Right parietal parenchymal hematoma with adjacent subarachnoid hemorrhage, similar to the recent CT.
The appearance remains most suspicious for cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
As noted on the prior examinations, continued followup is suggested to ensure there is no underlying mass.
MRI [**1-4**]: Redemonstration of right parietal lobe hemorrhage, with subarachnoid extension, without clear identification of a source for the hemorrhage.
A CTA was performed which did not reveal AVM or aneurysm.
A neurology consult was obtained to help discern between mass with hemorrhagic conversion, or a true CVA.
On [**1-2**] the patient was found to have a focal left arm seizure - a stat Head CT was performed which showed no change in the size of the hemorrhage.
Keppra was added for increased seizure prophylaxis.
The decision was made to transfer care to the neurology service for further evaluation and management of this hemorrhagic stroke.
He developed stridor and respiratory distress while on the floor, for which a code was called and he was intubated and transferred back to the Neuro ICU.
Vocal cords were visualized while in ICU and noted to be edematous, likely from trauma during PEG procedure.
He failed extubation twice; despite attempts with racemic epinephrine and steroids.
He had left upper extremity swelling and was found to have a large extensive DVT in left UE, so was started on Coumadin and Lovenox bridge.
He had a PICC in the left UE which was removed.
However, on Monday [**2201-1-19**] he developed respiratory distress with tachypnea to 40s, desaturation, SBP to 215.
CXR showed midline trach and no white out.
Possibly mucus plugging or pneumonia.
Transferred with hypotension, fever, tachypnea and tachycardia, as well as multiorgan dysfunction, from presumed septic shock.
