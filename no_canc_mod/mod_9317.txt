Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the LA.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.
A prominent Chiari network is present (normal variant).
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
Mildly dilated aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Mildly dilated descending aorta.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Physiologic MR (within normal limits).
Suboptimal image quality.
The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
Results Conclusions PRE BYPASS The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There are no other changes from the pre-bypass study.
