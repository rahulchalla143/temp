Admission Date:  [**2136-5-1**]       Discharge Date:  [**2136-5-11**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  Service:  ACOVE HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension and squamous-cell carcinoma of the tongue, who was found down at home by the EMTs on [**2136-5-1**] after life-line activation.
By EMT report, the patient was found alert, confused, and noted to not be transferred to [**Hospital 16843**] Hospital, where evaluation revealed hyponatremia to 127, leukocytosis at 19,000, CK of 14,000 with MB of 85, troponin of 8.81, and right and chronic subdural hematoma.
They felt that his mental status changes were more likely to be metabolic in etiology, given the patient's myoglobinemia and hyponatremia.
Head CT here revealed a small bilateral subdural fluid collection consistent with acute and chronic subdural hematomas.
Chest x-ray was negative for infiltrate.
EKG revealed ST segment depressions of approximately 1 mm in leads 2 and 3.
The [**Hospital 228**] medical Intensive Care Unit course was notable for improving mental status with correction of metabolic abnormalities.
No aspirin was given to the patient given his subdural hematomas.
The CKs demonstrated a downward trend with urine alkalinization to 3500 on transfer.
Squamous-cell carcinoma of the tongue status post resection in [**2130**].
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
He is in no acute distress.
HEENT:   Examination revealed the forehead to have a macular erythema with diffuse scaling.
CARDIOVASCULAR : Regular rate and rhythm with distant S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
LUNGS:  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with minimal air movement due to poor inspiratory effort.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended with no hepatosplenomegaly.
There was no lower extremity edema or cords.
Skin is warm and dry without evidence of rashes.
Chest x-ray revealed clear lungs.
CT of the head revealed multiple small bilateral acute and chronic subdural hematomas with no shift or mass effect.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 79-year-old male with a history of hypertension and tongue cancer, who was found down and subsequently found to have rhabdomyolysis, hyponatremia, troponin leak with EKG changes, in addition to acute and chronic subdural hematomas.
He was followed closely the Neurosurgical Service for his subdural hematomas.
Instead, they have recommended repeating a CAT scan of the head in several weeks.
The patient was seen by the Neurology Service, as well, particularly regarding the patient's history of recurrent falls.
They felt that the patient's presentation could be consistent with a progressive supranuclear palsy or Parkinson plus type syndrome.
They requested MRI to better evaluate for any structural abnormalities.
Incidentally, the MRI revealed a lesion over C2 that the radiologist felt was concerning for a potential bony metastases.
The patient subsequently had a bone scan, which was negative for metastatic disease to the bone.
The patient, at this time, may be started on a trial of Sinemet in order to assess for a potential response.
He continued to do well from a renal standpoint.
HYPONATREMIA:  The patient's hyponatremia was felt to be most consistent with SIADH.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had an echocardiogram on admission, which revealed 2+ mitral regurgitation and a normal ejection fraction.
The patient was started on an ACE inhibitor for after-load reduction.
He would likely do best in a acute level rehabilitation center.
Acute and chronic subdural hematomas.
Hyponatremia consistent with SIADH.
DIET:  The patient's diet will consist of pureed foods and thickened liquids.
