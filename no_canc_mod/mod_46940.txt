Bleeding thought to be [**1-30**] varices, but no bleeding from varices seen on EGD.
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics given persistent hypotension.
He was evaluated by transplant surgery and eventually was extubated without difficulty.
He became increasingly tachypneic and required several large volume paracenteses to control respiratory symptoms - no evidence of SBP on any of his ascitic fluid.
He again developed hypotension requiring blood pressure support with Levophed and had to be removed from transplant list as was felt to be too clinically unstable to undergo transplant.
His antibiotics were broadened to cover HAP and fungal infections - vancomycin, cefepime and micafungin.
He developed hypoxic respiratory distress and required intubation.
In the next 12 hours, in spite of maximal pressor support and fluids, patient continued to have a severe metabolic acidosis thought to be from profound septic shock likely from a pulmonary source.
Autopsy was offered and the patient's wife requested a full autopsy with no restrictions.
