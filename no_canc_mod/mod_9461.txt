Most recent cardiac cath and echo revealed severe MR along with moderate AI.
Past Medical History: Mitral Regurgitation and Aortic Insufficiency Aortic Dissection s/p Aortic Root Replacement [**2153**] Coronary Artery Disease s/p Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 2 [**2155**], s/p Stents to left main and POBA of OM1 [**2155**] Complete Heart Block s/p PPM [**2160**] Hypertension Hyperlipidemia s/p Appendectomy s/p Tonsillectomy  Social History: Retired.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2).
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
An ascending aortic and arch graft is also seen.
Other findings are unchanged [**10-29**] Head CT: There is diffuse cerebral edema identified with compression of the ventricles.
There are multiple infarcts identified bilaterally involving the posterior cerebral and anterior cerebral arteries as well as the right superior cerebellar artery as well as the watershed distribution.
There is no hemorrhage identified.
Unfortunately due to a very fragile and heavily calcified aorta along with adherent scar tissue, aortic valve replacement could not be performed.
Due to the heavily calcified aorta and unplanned circulatory arrest, there was much concern for neurologic injury.
A head CT scan on postoperative day two showed diffuse cerebral edema with deformity of the brain stem indicating central herniation.
There was also downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils indicating tonsillar herniation.
The CT scan also showed multiple infarcts involving the posterior cerebral and anterior cerebral arteries as well as the right superior cerebellar artery as well as the watershed distribution.
No hemorrhage was identified.
