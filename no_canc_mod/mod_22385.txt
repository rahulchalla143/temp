He complained of diffuse pain but then this worsened to odynophagia and finally developed neck swelling and crepitus.
On his preoperative studies, a chest CT noted the presence of pneumomediastinum and air around the cervical esophagus.
There was pleural fluid which looked more complex than a simple effusion in both pleural spaces.
There did not appear to be any other esophageal pathology.

There is continued small left pleural effusion with atelectasis in the left lung base.
Minimal patchy atelectasis is seen at the right lung base.
No pneumothorax is noted.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: swallow study w/ WATER SOLUBLE CONTRAST ONLY.eval for esophageal leak.
BARIUM ESOPHAGRAM  INDICATION: 25-year-old man with esophageal rupture and repair.
BARIUM ESOPHAGRAM: Orally administered Optiray contrast was observed under fluoroscopic guidance passing freely into the stomach with no evidence for extra luminal extravasation.
There is no aspiration into the airway and no significant retention in the vallecular or piriformis sinuses.
No structural abnormalities are detected in the region of the pharynx, cervical esophagus, or mid and distal esophagus.
There is no evidence for extra luminal extravasation of contrast.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for extraluminal extravasation.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report TEETH (PANOREX FOR DENTAL)  [**2101-9-28**] 1:59 PM Reason: abscess  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 25 year old man with poor dentition REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: abscess HISTORY: Abscess, ____.
The mandibular condyles and TM joints are excluded from this view.
There is increased density over the mental portion of the mandible, obscuring fine bony detail.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report ESOPHAGUS  [**2101-9-8**] 8:23 PM Reason: need swallow study under fluoro to assess for esophageal [**Doctor First Name **] Contrast: [**Hospital 13288**] [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 25 year old man with REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: need swallow study under fluoro to assess for esophageal leak  ESOPHAGEAL STUDY  INDICATION FOR STUDY: Evaluate for esophageal leak following trauma to neck.
A scout film of the upper thorax and neck reveals free air within the mediastinum.
Thereafter, a water-soluble esophageal study was performed which demonstrates a leak in the upper esophagus on the right side at the level of the manubrium.
Free extravasation of air and contrast is noted to the right side of the esophagus at this level with passage of leaked contents both superiorly and inferiorly tracking along the right side of the esophagus.
The remaining mid and distal esophagus is entirely normal with no leakage present or mucosal irregularities.
IMPRESSION: Rupture of esophagus on right side at level of manubrium with leaked contents traveling both superiorly and inferiorly along the right side of the esophagus.
On that day, he underwent a repair of his cervical esophageal perforation with wide drainage of the neck, right thoracotomy, exploration and wide drainage of the mediastinum, placement of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, placement of left chest tube, esophagogastroduodenoscopy and flexible bronchoscopy.
Upon presentation, his diagnosis was made via an esophagram which showed his esophageal rupture was at the level of manubrium with leaked contents traveling both superiorly and inferiorly along the right side of the esophagus.
A follow-up esophagram was done on POD 9 but showed a continued leak.
From an infectious disease standpoint, a sputum culture on [**9-11**] returned positive for Klebsiella and he was additionally placed on Unasyn.
Furthermore, a JP fluid culture from [**9-22**] was also positive for Klebsiella and he was then switched from Unasyn to Levofloxacin on [**2101-9-24**] for more narrowed, specific antibiotic coverage.
He was then taken back to the OR on [**2101-9-26**] for a Left VATS after two large loculated pleural effusions were noted on imaging.
He had been afebrile for approximately a week--beginning a day or two after his left VATS.
