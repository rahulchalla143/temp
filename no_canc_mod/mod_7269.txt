Ms. [**Known lastname 23609**] was admitted 1 month ago to [**Hospital1 18**] with acute diastolic heart failure.
TTE done during that admission demonstrated moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation; increased from 2+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] from [**2113-9-22**].
Although echocardiogram showed evidence of possible former rheumatic heart disease, the underlying cause of her valvular dysfunction is unclear.
+8 pound weight loss in last month, which she attributes to poor appetite.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: Type 1 DM--A1C 7.5% in [**2114-9-22**]; c/b peripheral neuropathy and retinopathy; on insulin pump [**Year (4 digits) 1291**] [**2112-3-22**]: St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] 19 mm valve.
Anemia with baseline Hct 28-31 Mitral regurg (3+ on TTE [**2114-11-5**]) and 3+ TR Mitral stenosis (mild with rheumatic valvular deformities on [**Month/Day/Year 113**] [**2113-9-22**]) Depression Anxiety Dyslipidemia Hypertension Celiac disease .
She does not feel that narcotic pain control while in the hospital will trigger a relapse.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Slightly short of breath with conversation.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
RR, normal S1, S2 with loud click.
IV/VI systolic murmur throughout precordium.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
+ Crackles at bases; no wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Severe aortic stenosis.
No definite pneumothorax is appreciated on the left.
There is some residual atelectatic change at the left base.
No spontaneous [**Month/Day (2) 113**] contrast or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Mild-moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Mildly depressed LVEF.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity.
Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.
Abnormal septal motion/position.
AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Moderate thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Moderate valvular MS (MVA 1.0-1.5cm2) Moderate to severe (3+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Suboptimal image quality.
No spontaneous [**Last Name (Prefixes) 113**] contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is moderate to severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with prior cardiac surgery.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
There is moderate valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.1 cm2).
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
A tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring is seen in situ.
Can not rule out a perivalvular component.
Cardiac cath on [**11-20**] showed no CAD, elevated right and left filling pressures and severe pulmonary hypertension.
She was found to be in complete heart block and was seen by EP.
Discharge Instructions: Call with fever, redness or drainage from incision or weight gain more than 2 pounds in one day or five in one week.
Shower, no baths, no lotions, creams or powders to incisions.
