Studies:  Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2142-4-29**] 10:59 PM IMPRESSION: Bibasal lung findings, most likely due to aspiration or or developing infection  Radiology Report CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of [**2142-4-30**] 1:43 AM IMPRESSION: Limited exam, due to lack of oral contrast, paucity of intra-abdominal fat, motion, and arm placement.
No definite acute intra-abdominal process.
If high suspicion for diverticulitis, can repeat exam with oral contrast.
Bibasilar consolidations either represent atelectasis, aspiration, or pneumonia.
T10 compression fracture, age indeterminant but new since PET CT on [**2138-10-2**], with mild retropulsion.
1.0 cm hyperenhancing lesion in right lobe of liver and moderate intrahepatic biliary duct dilitation is unchanged.
Left adnexal cystic structure is slightly increased in size.
In addition, the presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
The size of the cardiac silhouette and the mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm are unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION: Patient is an 81F with multiple medical problems, including recurrent [**Name (NI) **] UTIs and Cdiff colitis who presented with hypoxia, chills and productive cough and found to have a PNA and UTI.
ACUTE CARE:  # Healthcare Acquired PNEUMONIA: Patient had a clinical presentation c/w PNA - productive cough, chills, new hypoxia and leukocytosis.
CXR showed bibasilar opacities concerning for PNA.
Prior to discharge her antibiotics were switched to PO Levofloxacin to finish an 8 day course and she remained afebrile and her leukocytosis resolved.
She no longer complained of dysuria following initiation of antibiotics.
# LLQ ABDOMINAL PAIN Patient presented with 8/10 abd pain and LLQ tenderness on exam in the ED, concerning for diverticulitis.
Pt underwent CT abd/pelvis in the ED, which did not show acute findings.
Abdominal exam on arrival in the MICU revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness and tense abdominal wall muscles.
Final CT read showed no definite intra-abdominal process and antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin/cefepime.
Her abdominal pain resolved quickly on arrival to the unit without further intervention.
She had no further pain during the rest of the admission.
# LEUKOCYTOSIS Patient had WBC of 14 on admission, reflective of inflammatory response to multiple infections as discussed above.
No bands on diff.
She was treated for pneumonia and UTI and her WBC trended down to normal.
# CHRONIC PAIN Pt w/known pelvic fracture 5y ago and osteoporosis.
# CHRONIC CONSTIPATION - continued MiraLax QD, senna 8.6 mg x2 Capsule(s) Daily .
# FAILURE TO THRIVE Pt cachectic on exam, suggestive of chronic nutritional deficiency possibly [**1-25**] underlying medical problems but also possibly related to suspected depression (noted by rehab MDs, not evaluated).
# FALL PRECAUTIONS Needs PT/OT chronically.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: Pt appears to have a parkinsonian like tremor on exam.
