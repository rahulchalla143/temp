Admission Date:  [**2153-6-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2153-6-8**]    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is an 81 year old woman with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and an AV pacemaker, who was admitted for elective septal ablation.
She has had progressive worsening of her mixed outflow gradient plus valvular aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation over the past few years with a peak aortic gradient of 105, a mean of 48, on transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2153-5-1**], and left ventricular outflow gradient of 74 by catheterization on [**2153-5-23**].
She is fully functional and walks approximately one mile per day and uses a stationary bike, swims about 20 minutes per day and  She denies any shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea or vomiting associated with exercise, however, she complains of mild increasing fatigue with exercise over the last few months.
She denies any claudication, edema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, or lightheadedness.
Her cardiac history includes a catheterization in [**2146**] which showed no significant coronary artery disease outside of a 50% lesion at the origin of D1 and mild narrowing of the left circumflex at its origin.
Again, no significant coronary disease, with mild valvular stenosis.
Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2153-5-1**], showed an ejection fraction of 65% along with moderate to severe aortic stenosis, one plus aortic regurgitation, four plus mitral regurgitation and three plus tricuspid regurgitation with a gradient across the aortic valve of 48.
Catheterization on [**2153-5-23**], showed severe resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient of 74; the gradient increased to 166 with Dobutamine.
Aortic valve stenosis itself was mild with a peak gradient of 28, a mean of 23.
Based on increasing left ventricular outflow gradient, an elective alcohol septal ablation was performed on [**2153-6-6**].
Post-procedure, the left ventricular outflow gradient at rest and with provocation decreased markedlyto 20 with an aortic valve gradient unchanged at 25 mmHg, compared with pre- procedure.
There were no complications of the procedure and the patient was transferred to Cardiac Care Unit for close hemodynamic monitoring and post myocardial infarction precautions.
Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with septal     ablation, AND mild valvular aortic stenosis.
History of rheumatic fever as a child.
Chronic intermittant Vertigo with left inner ear injury.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a brother who developed coronary artery disease in his fifties.
ALLERGIES:   Vancomycin which causes itching and a rash; cephalosporins which cause GI upset; Clindamycin which causes a rash as well as lip swelling and penicillin which causes swelling.
HEENT showed an oropharynx which was clear.
Her neck is supple and there is no thyromegaly.
She had a III/VI harsh holosystolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border which radiated to the apex.
On extremity examination, her right groin site was without oozing, hematoma or bruits.
EKG done pre-procedure showed ventricular paced with a rate of 70 beats per minute and a left bundle branch block morphology.
IMPRESSION:  This is an 81 year old with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis with progressive worsening of exercise tolerance and a rise in her left ventricular outflow tract gradient.
Cardiovascular:  The patient without any significant coronary artery disease.
Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition:   On presentation, the patient was hyponatremic and hyperkalemic, which was partly at baseline, but additionally attributed to a large amount of intravenous fluids received in the catheterization laboratory.
Hydrochlorothiazide was held due to electrolyte abnormalities but will be restarted upon discharge.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient with complaints of black stool times one but denied any bright red blood per rectum.
Given her history of GI bleed in the past, stools were ordered for guaiac.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy status post alcohol ablation, AND stable mild valvular aortic stenosis.
Polymyalgia rheumatica.
