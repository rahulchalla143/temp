He also noted "two-toned stool" which he described as normal appearing on one side and dark black on the other side.
The patient states that he first presented with similar symptoms two months ago to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital, at which time, per his report, an EGD was performed and he was diagnosed with an ulcer.
After this presentation, his stools returned to [**Location 213**] and his DOE and dizziness resolved until this acute presentation.
At this time he was found to be tachycardic and have an INR of 2.9 and a Hct of 21 with guaiac positive, black stool.
Review of systems: Denies fevers, chills, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, hematuria, or dysuria.
Past Medical History: - bicuspid aortic valve leading to stenosis s/p bioprosthetic AVR in [**2200-8-2**] - CAD with 3VD s/p CABG in [**2200-8-2**] - AFib, on anticoagulation with warfarin - DM2 - HTN - HLP - degenerative lumbar disc disease - h/o umbilical hernia repair  Social History: 2 ppd x 45 yrs, quit [**2200-8-2**].

CXR: No consolidation or edema is evident.
There is mild aortic tortuosity.
No effusion or pneumothorax is noted.
The osseous structures reveal extensive degenerative changes throughout the thoracic spine.

Patient's anticoagulation status made him more susceptible to recurrent GI bleeding.
# Elevated Cr: Initially unclear if this represented ARF as patient's baseline Cr was not known.
Pre-renal failure could be consistent with the patient's history of GI bleeding.
- Cr improved with fluid hydration and transfusions  #Leukocytosis: Elevated WBC count noted on [**2201-4-4**], which resolved on [**2201-4-5**] with no intervention.
Patient's CHADS2 = 3 assuming he has CHF (not clearly documented, but likely given medications of metoprolol succinate, lasix, lisinopril, and ROS positive for DOE at baseline).
Warfarin not prescribed at discharge as risks of recurrent GI bleed deemed to be very high; to be discussed further by outpatient PCP and Cardiologist.
Patient's statin was continued; beta-blocker and Lisinopril were re-started at half-dose as patient's blood pressure was only mildly elevated.
Aspirin held in setting of recent GIB.
# DM2: Metformin held; would re-start at discharge.
# HTN: Antihypertensives held initially in setting of active bleeding and acute renal failure; adjustments as above.
