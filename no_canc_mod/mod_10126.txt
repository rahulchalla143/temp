She then presented on [**2177-5-2**] to MWH with shortness or breath and PND.
She was found to be in congestive heart failure.
A CTA was negative for a PE, but an echocardiogram revealed severe mitral regurgitation with a flail posterior leaflet, dilated LV, and normal EF.
She then underwent a cardiac cath which revealed clean coronary arteries and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical intervention of her mitral valve.
Past Medical History: Asthma, h/o Ruptured thyroid cyst, Corneal abrasion  Social History: Non-smoker, Rare ETOH  Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: Neuro: A&O x 3, MAE, non-focal Neck: Supple, FROM -JVD, -Carotid Bruit HEENT: NCAT, EOMI, PERRL, OP benign Lungs: CTAB -w/r/r CV: Irreg.
[**3-18**] HSM at apex Abd: Soft, NT/ND, +BS Ext: Warm, well-perfused, -edema, 2+pulses  Pertinent Results: Echo [**5-6**]: Pre Bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
A moderate sized secundum atrial septal defect is present.
There is no evidence of a presistent left svc on left arm injection of agitated saline.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and trace aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears moderately thickened and myxomatous with a dikated annulus (5cm).
There is bileaflet prolapse and posterior partial flail.
There is at least 3+ mitral regurgitation with an ecentric jet directed anteriorly and hugging the anterior wall.
