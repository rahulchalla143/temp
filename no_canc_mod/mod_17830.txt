HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname 72314**] [**Known lastname 72313**] was born at 29-1/7 weeks gestation at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital by emergent cesarean section for a nonreassuring fetal heart rate.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for prematurity and respiratory distress.
This pregnancy was complicated by insulin-dependent gestational mellitus, chronic hypertension, and thrombocytopenia (likely idiopathic thrombocytopenia).
Rupture of membranes occurred at the time of delivery.
Comfortable respirations except for some mild nasal congestion.
Heart with regular rate and rhythm, no murmur.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended and with active bowel sounds.
No sacral anomalies.
Hip exam was tight hips with limited, slightly decreased range of motion and some overall mild increased tone.
He was     treated with caffeine for apnea or prematurity until day     of life #33.
His last episode of bradycardia occurred on     [**2154-6-7**].
On     exam he does have some mild nasal congestion but it does     not interfere with feedings and there are no secretions.
He does     have an intermittent grade [**1-26**] flow murmur.
Gastrointestinal Status: He was treated with phototherapy     for physiologic hyperbilirubinemia from day of #1 until     day of life #6.
He also has a     mild direct hyperbilirubinemia due to prolonged     hyperalimentation.
Infectious Disease Status: He was started on ampicillin     and gentamicin at the time of delivery for sepsis risk     factors.
He completed a 7-day course of antibiotics for     presumed sepsis and blood culture did remain negative.
A blood culture at that time was     positive for methicillin-resistant Staph aureus.
Neurology: He had head ultrasounds done on day of life     #3, day of life #7, day of life #30 and day of life #55,     and they all showed no evidence of abnormality.
Born between 32 and 35 weeks with 2 of the following:         Daycare during the RSV season, a smoker in the         household, neuromuscular disease, airway         abnormalities, or school-age siblings.
Chronic lung disease.
Hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.
Before this age and for the first 24 months of the     child's life, immunization against influenza is     recommended for household contacts and out of home     caregivers.
The     American Academy of Pediatrics recommends initial     vaccination of preterm infants at or following discharge     from the hospital if they are clinically stable and at     least 6 weeks, but fewer than 12 weeks of age.
Follow-up can be considered with pulmonary service due     to history of chronic lung diseae (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4468**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37305**],     [**Hospital3 1810**]).
Status post prematurity at 29 weeks gestation.
Status post perinatal depression.
Status post respiratory distress syndrome.
Status post methicillin-resistant Staph aureus     bacteremia.
Status post phsyiologic hyperbilirubinemia.
Status post direct hyperbilirubinemia due to PN     cholestasis.
Status post chronic lung disease.
Status post apnea of prematurity.
