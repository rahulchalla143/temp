Admission Date:  [**2143-12-24**]       Discharge Date:  [**2143-12-26**]    CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Chest pain with unresponsiveness.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is an 81 year old woman with a history of hypertension and pneumonia recently in her usual state of health until 05:45 p.m. when she complained of chest discomfort and then began leaning to her left side.
She was then noted to slump in her chair and become unresponsive and was found to have a right gaze deviation when EMS arrived.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Significant for coronary artery disease and cancer.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On physical examination, her blood pressure was 179/80; heart rate 60; temperature 98.0 F.  The patient was obtunded with sharp optic discs.
There was no evidence of gaze preference.
There were no spontaneous movements.
Cardiovascular examination demonstrated a regular rate and rhythm with a I/VI systolic ejection murmur that radiated to her carotids.
There was no evidence of peripheral edema.
Her head CT scan demonstrated a large right frontal intraparenchymal bleed that was approximately 6 by 7 centimeters, with 1 centimeter of right-to-left shift.
There was also evidence of surrounding edema without frank herniation.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit where she was ruled out for an myocardial infarction by enzymes.
Her neurological status was closely monitored and she underwent a repeat head CT scan the following morning, which showed a large right cerebral hemispheric intraparenchymal bleed.
There was extension into her bilateral lateral ventricles as well as her third and fourth ventricle.
Mild uncal herniation was also noted as well as effacement of her sulci in her bilateral cerebral hemispheres, right greater than left.
A neurosurgical consultation was obtained who felt that there would be no benefit from undergoing decompression of the intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
