Admission Date:  [**2188-3-26**]       Discharge Date: [**2188-4-7**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  M  Service:  Neurology  REASON FOR ADMISSION:  New onset of left hemiparesis and somnolence.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 87-year-old left-handed male with a history of hypertension and benign prostatic hypertrophy who fell on [**2188-3-1**] and fractured his left clavicle and left tenth and eleventh ribs.
He was admitted to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 792**]hospital where he developed a pulmonary embolism on [**2188-3-6**] and was placed on Coumadin, after which he was discharged to [**Hospital3 2558**] on [**2188-3-21**].
In rehabilitation, he developed a urinary tract infection in his indwelling catheter and was put on levofloxacin 500 mg intravenously q.24h.
He was evaluated at the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department for evaluation and replacement of the catheter for indwelling Foley catheter.
In the [**Hospital **], the patient was somewhat somnolent but arousable, but he did have a noted increased confusion at night with periods of lucency during the day.
Upon admission to the [**Hospital1 69**], the patient was noted in the chart to be somnolent but arousable and while he was thought to be alert and oriented times three he was intermittently drowsy but could discuss politics and talk on the telephone.
The next morning, the patient was noted to be more lethargic, unable to answer questions, and had a new left hemiparesis, and Neurology was consulted.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Pulmonary embolism (on Coumadin).
History of old abnormal electroencephalogram by family report, but unclear of details surrounding this.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
His head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed dry mucous membranes.
His cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
The lungs revealed coarse raspy sounds in the back of the throat but were clear bilaterally in the lung fields.
Abdominal examination revealed some tenderness on palpation of the middle abdomen, but it was soft, and this was nonspecific.
Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
On neurologic examination, mental status, he was sleeping but briefly opened his eyes to vigorous or painful stimulation.
There was also some exotropia of the left eye and was slightly downgoing at rest but was able to follow motion in all directions.
There was also left horizontal nystagmus on left lateral gaze.
There was observed to be some vertigo nystagmus as well with lifting both eyelids.
There was a left lower facial droop showing teeth.
On motor examination, he had increased left lower extremity tone and 0/5 strength in the extensors in the left upper extremity.
There was a brisk left upgoing toe.
There was no ankle clonus.
Coordination, sensation, and gait were difficult to assess due to his mental status.
SOMNOLENCE AND LEFT-SIDED WEAKNESS WITH EXTRAOCULAR MOTOR ABNORMALITIES:  The patient was found to have a right pontine and middle cerebellar peduncle stroke.
It was unclear whether this was entirely small vessel in etiology or whether there was an embolus in the posterior circulation; although, he was therapeutic on Coumadin.
From the onset of transferring him to Neurology, he had significant problems protecting his airway from secretions and occasionally had mild respiratory distress.
He was monitored on the floor until [**3-28**] when it was felt that his breathing was worse; and although he was do not resuscitate, his family felt that he would want to be intubated for worsening respiratory distress.
On [**3-30**], he apparently had an aspiration event with hypercarbic respiratory failure and was intubated.
Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a subacute infarction in the right pons (as mentioned) with diffusion restriction and chronic periventricular microvascular ischemic changes.
It was thought to be 40% to 50% stenosis of the mid basilar artery.
There was also thought to be a 40% to 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
He did also receive a magnetic resonance angiography of the neck which, as mentioned, revealed the evidence of the left internal carotid artery stenosis, but no right internal carotid artery stenosis.
There was also no evidence for vertebral artery dissection.
Serial chest x-rays did demonstrate of right lower lobe lung zone atelectasis and a left retrocardiac opacity.
Serial chest x-rays do continue to show left lower lobe atelectasis versus consolidation associated with pleural effusion.
PULMONARY STATUS:  As mentioned above in the previous paragraph, the patient was intubated primarily for difficulty protecting his airway and difficulty with secretions with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
After extension discussions with the family regarding the prognosis of his dysarthria and dysphagia, it was determined that even though the patient had a living will saying that he did not want a feeding tube or a tracheostomy to keep him alive that the prospects for recovery were significant and that a feeding tube could be placed; according to what his family felt his wishes were regarding temporary feeding.
At this time, there are no plans for any tracheostomy tube placement for better access for secretions.
GASTROENTEROLOGY ISSUES:  The patient had an episode of melanotic stool on [**2188-4-3**] which was guaiac-positive.
It was offered to the family a colonoscopy as well as an upper endoscopy, but they felt that these should be deferred in the absence of any brisk bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract.
He did not have any further guaiac-positive stools at the time of this dictation.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was initially treated with levofloxacin for both his urinary tract infection and a presumed aspiration pneumonia.
He remained febrile, and mainly the issues were with secretion management.
His creatinine remained stable, and there were no significant electrolyte abnormalities.
There was occasional hypokalemia, but this repleted.
NOTE:  It should be mentioned that the urine culture from [**3-26**] did eventually grow out Escherichia coli and Enterococcus that were pan-sensitive.
