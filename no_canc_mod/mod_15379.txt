RESPIRATORY:  She did not have any respiratory distress and has remained in room air throughout this admission.
She has no evidence of any apnea of prematurity.
She had a soft intermittent murmur which was heard on day number 12 which subsequently disappeared.
In view of persistently dilated loops of bowel on her serial KUBs, a barium enema was performed on [**2174-9-14**] which revealed evidence of a small left-sided colon.
She currently takes 150 cc per kilogram per day of breast milk 24 calories per ounce (this was increased from 22 calories on [**2174-9-22**] in view of overall poor weight gain).
