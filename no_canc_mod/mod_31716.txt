She had been having SOB x2-3 days.
Unclear if she had also been having cough or fevers.
[**3-26**] she had an unwitnessed fall with associated dizziness and then called out to her [**Age over 90 **] y.o.
She also uncerwent head CT and C-spine CT for her fall which were negative except for old C2 fracture and cervical stenosis/DJD.
Because of the unequal pupils her head CT was repeated which again did not show ICH or mass effect.
There was also concern for PE so she received one dose of lovenox and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Cardiology performed a limited bedside echo which showed small RV with good contractility, no suggestion of PE per report from ED.

Low voltage throughout.
[**2193-3-27**] TTE ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the apex (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]) and possibly the basal inferior wall (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
There is no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a small posterior pericardial effusion.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional systolic dysfunction suggestive of CAD, but preserved global systolic function.
No definite valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Small posterior pericardial effusion.
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
AORTA: Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No masses or vegetations on aortic valve.
No mass or vegetation on mitral valve.
No mass or vegetation on tricuspid valve.
Conclusions No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Right atrial appendage ejection velocity is good (>20 cm/s).
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are complex (>4mm, non-mobile) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of intracardiac thrombus or endocarditis seen.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Complex, non-mobile atheroma in the descending aorta.
There are diffuse bilateral airspace opacities worrisome for severe pulmonary edema.
Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.
No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen, although the right costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image.
Mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary abnormality is already cleared from the left lung, improving on the right.
No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
There is adequate opacification of the thoracic aorta and pulmonary arteries.
There is no evidence of aneurysm or dissection.
No central filling defects are seen in the main pulmonary arteries.
There is a 19 x 15 mm right hilar node, series 2, image 25.
A second, smaller right hilar node is seen measuring 11.6 mm, series 2, image 26.
There are bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
There is associated atelectasis at both lung bases.
There is a small pericardial effusion, series 2, image 37 measuring an average of 10 Hounsfield units consistent with simple fluid.
The visualization of the abdominal organs is somewhat limited by streak artifact secondary to the patient's body habitus.
There are no renal masses.
Evaluation of the right lateral subcutaneous soft tissues is precluded secondary to streak artifact from the patient's side abutting the CT gantry.
However, along the left lateral abdominal wall, there is an area of subcutaneous edema measuring approximately 4 x 9 x 20 cm.
The wall of this collection does not enhance, and findings are more consistent with subcutaneous edema rather than an abscess.
The colon is visualized from the cecum to the rectum and is moderately distended and fluid filled.
There is narrowing of several mid thoracic disc spaces as well.
However, there are no lytic or blastic lesions.
Several nonspecific findings including bilateral pleural effusions with associated lower lobe atelectasis, small pericardial effusion, and fairly extensive inflammatory changes in the subcutaneous fat of the left abdominal wall.
Distended completely fluid-filled colon without evidence of small bowel dilatation.
However, the wall of the colon does not appear to be thickened and does not demonstrate any abnormal enhancement.
[**2193-4-11**] EEG - IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to a slow and disorganized background rhythm and due to bursts of bifrontal slowing.
There were no prominent areas of focal slowing but encephalopathies can obscure focal findings.
There were no clear epileptiform discharges .
Mild interseptal thickening, might represent pulmonary congestion.
No pericardial or pleural effusion is seen on current examination.
Subsegmental atelectasis in the apical segment of the left lower lobe and in both lung bases, infection cannot be definitely ruled out.
No intra-abdominal source for fevers is identified.
Unchanged evidence of minimal interstitial fluid overload.
Minimal atelectasis at the right lung base.
No overt pulmonary edema.
No pleural effusions.
No pneumonia .
CXR [**2193-4-23**]: IMPRESSION; In order to differentiate recent widening of left upper mediastinum due to engorged mediastinal vessels which appears reasonable as reflected by interval worsening mild pulmonary edema vs acute aortic pathology, erect view is recommended for further evaluation.
Volumes are still low and mediastinal widening is most likely due to vascular engorgement.
Aside from right basal atelectasis there is no focal pulmonary abnormality.
Pulmonary edema which was present on [**4-17**], not recurred.
Poor R wave progression, likely a normal variant.
Since the previous tracing of [**2193-4-21**] no significant change.
Compared to tracing #1 there is no significant diagnostic change.

BAL revealed blood on aspiration x3 consistent with diffuse alveolar hemmorhage.
Shock: Patient presented in shock of unclear etiology but most likely septic versus cardiogenic.
She did have evidence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and ARDS presumed to be from pneumonia though this was not clear.
Her blood cultures grew two bottles of coagulase negative staphylococcus though her sputum cultures did not grow any pathogenic organisms.
Her body habitus and high PEEP requirement made hemodynamic monitoring difficult and she persistently required pressors so a swan ganz catheter was placed for further hemodynamic monitoring.
Her atrial flutter was believed to be decreasing her cardiac output so she was cardioverted after TEE did not show and thrombus or vegetations.
Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: She has limited baseline pulmonary function becasue of her COPD on 2-3L, OSA, and obesity hypoventilation.
The etiology of her acute decompensation is of unclear etiology.
CXR showed diffuse bilateral alveolar reticular opacities and had ARDS by large A-a gradient and PaO2/Fio2  ~72.
Her bronchoscopy showed DAH though vasculitis labs were negative.
The most likely etiology was believed to be pneumonia leading to ARDS and DAH.
Because of her large body habitus she required significant amount of PEEP to maintain adequate oxygenation.
Repeat bronchoscopy was performed [**4-13**] and demonstrated blood-tinged sputum, suggestive of recurrent or ongoing DAH.
Salmetrol was held for potential QT-prolonging interaction with seroquel, which she is on for delirium.
More agressive diuresis had resultes in creatinine bumps.
Atrial Flutter: Patient presented in atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction.
A TEE was performed which did not show any clot and she was started on heparin and succesfully cardioverted.
She was already started on vancomycin for her PNA as above.
She did not have any indwelling vascular access on admission.
She completed a 10 day course of antibiotics on [**4-4**] and did not have any subsequent positive blood cultures.
UTI: Patient had a positive UA on [**4-15**] and was started on ceftriaxone.
Fever - patient developed persistent low grade fever on the night of [**5-9**].
No evolution of her CXR, no diarrhea, no nasal mucus, skin intact.
Vanco/Zosyn course completed [**4-4**]; she did appear to improve on ABX but not entirely afebrile, but fever curve worsening.
Sputum gram stain was notable for yeast and GPCs.
ID was consulted given persistent fever without identifiable cause.
It was stopped, and pt again spiked a fever above 101, making that hypothesis unlikely.
UA then showed moderate leukocytes, and patient was started on ceftriaxone.
Fever curver continued to be monitored and patient remained afebrile for several days prior to discharge.
On presentation to the OSH the nature of her fall was unclear so she underwent CT head and c-spine.
After treatment with albuterol and ipratropium at the OSH she was noted to have an enlarged L pupil so a repeat head CT was performed which again did not show any acute changes.
Altered mental status - patient was intermittently agitated throughout the course of her ICU stay.
Psychiatry was consulted in the setting of acute agitation and inability to wean from vent and patient was trialed on seroquel and haldol alternating.
Seroquel was eventually used primarily with haldol prn, but patient continued to become delirious at night, requiring extra sedation.
CHRONIC CARE: .
She had only a complaint of mild cramping abdominal pain associated with tube feeds during her stay.
