The patient was well until 3 days prior to transfer when she felt like she was going to have an episode of diarrhea and instead passed bright red blood, filling the toilet bowl.
She had two similar episodes on the following day and went to the ED at [**Hospital3 3583**] where she had an additional 5 episodes of BRBPR.
She does note 3 days of a "stomachache" associated with a sensation of excess gas in her abdomen; these symptoms completely resolved 4 days prior to her first episode of BRBPR.
She has not had any abdominal cramping or pain.
Fresh heme was noted in the left colon up to 60 cm from the anal verge; no active bleeding was observed.
There were scattered diverticula; no lesions or polyps were identified, and no inflammatory changes were noted.
Several hours after the procedure, she had two additional episodes of BRBPR with approximately 200 cc of blood loss each time.
Her last episode of BRBPR was approximately 8:30 pm tonight.
At [**Hospital3 3583**], she was incidentally noted to have a mild transaminitis.

Bleeding Scan, [**2112-3-8**]: No active GI bleeding during three hours of imaging .
EGD, [**2112-3-9**]: Granularity, erythema and erosion in the antrum and pre-pyloric region compatible with severe segmental gastritis.
Friability and erythema in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis (biopsy, biopsy).
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum .
Bleeding likely from small bowel .
Meckel's Scan [**2112-3-10**]: Flow images were obtained over the abdomen and pelvis in the anterior and posterior projections.
There is no abnormal uptake to indicate a Meckel's diverticulum.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of Meckel's diverticulum.
Small Bowel Enteroscopy, [**3-11**]: No bleeding source through to proximal ileum.
Based on colonoscopy findings from [**Hospital3 3583**], her bleeding was felt to be most likely due to intermittently bleeding diverticulum.
BRBPR The patient was not bleeding and was hemodynamically stable upon arrival to the MICU.
On the morning of [**3-8**], she had two episodes of bright red blood per rectum with loss of 500 cc blood each time.
She underwent a tagged red blood scan on [**3-8**] which showed no bleeding during 3 hours of evaluation.
EGD showed evidence for duodenitis and severe segmental gastritis.
Colonoscopy showed fresh blood in the ileum, diverticulosis of the ascending and sigmoid colon, and fresh blood throughout the colon.
These findings suggested a small bowel source of the bleed, and a Meckel's scan was recommended to search for a Meckel's diverticulum.
A small bowel enteroscopy was performed by the GI service with no evidence of bleeding as far as the proximal ileum.
It was thought that her right sided diverticulum was still the most likely cause of her bleeding.
She was discharged with instructions for followup with a primary care doctor and was instructed to return to the nearest ER immediately if her bleeding resumes.
# Antecubital fossa thrombophlebitis: At the site of a former IV, an area of redness and tenderness had developed which appeared to be most likely consistent with a thrombophlebitis.
Her mild transaminitis resolved.
Secondary: h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10750**]   Discharge Condition: Good: Hematocrits stable, still have small amount of residual clots in stool but much decreased, hemodynamically stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for a GI bleed.
Your workup included the following: A colonoscopy showed diverticuli in the ascending and sigmoid colon with red blood in the colon, an EGD showed only mild gastritis of the stomach (not likely be a bleeding source).
A bleeding scan was negative for bleeding source, and a Meckel's scan was negative for a bleeding Meckel's diverticulum.
Finally, a small bowel enteroscopy showed no evidence of an upper bleeding source to as far as the proximal ileum.
It is most likely that your bleeding is from your diverticulosis in your colon.
You were started on a medication called Protonix given your GI bleed which will help to protect the lining of you stomach.
You are scheduled to see a primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 766**] to get your hematocrit checked to ensure there is no further blood loss.
Seek medical attention immediately at your nearest emergency room if you experience a recurrence of bleeding in your stool.
Also you should seek medical attention immediately for the following: - Bright red blood in your stool - Black, foul smelling stools - Lightheadedness - Fatigue - Increasing shortness of breath with exertion - Abdominal pain, fevers, nausea or vomiting .
You have a gastric biopsy specimen pending.
Followup Instructions: Please followup with the [**Hospital3 **] at [**Hospital1 18**] to ensure your hematocrit is stable after your bleeding episode.
Please request the results of your gastric biopsy at this appointment as they are pending at the time of discharge.
