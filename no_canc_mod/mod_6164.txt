Patient has had epigastric pain relieved by vomiting.
Of note he has not had aspirin or ibuprofen.
Patient was tender in the epigastrium.
Past Medical History: Left-sided nephrectomy from a hemangioma Hypertension Tobacco abuse Chronic lower back and lower extremity pain from a traumatic fall in [**2132**] Rheumatic fever as a child Depression   Social History: Home: The patient lives alone in [**Location (un) 583**] in an apartment complex.
Family History: Notable for diabetes and hypertension.

MICROBIOLOGY: [**2136-10-23**] Blood Cx x 2 pending [**2136-10-26**] Blood Cx pending [**2136-10-26**] Urine Cx pending [**2136-10-28**] Cdiff toxin pending  STUDIES: [**2136-10-23**] EKG: Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats.
Increased precordial voltage.
Since the previous tracing of [**2136-9-26**] the rate is faster and atrial premature beats are new.
Precordial ST-T wave abnormalities are less prominent.
[**2136-10-23**] CXR: No acute intrathoracic process.
2.6 cm hypodense right lower pole renal lesion likely representing a complex cyst.
Status post left nephrectomy.
[**2136-10-25**] Portable CXR - severe pulmonary edema  [**2136-10-26**] Echo - EF > 75%; Mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Mild aortic dilation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
[**2136-10-26**] CXR interval worsening in left lower lobe opacity.
This  could be due to atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be totally excluded.
Right lower lobe atelectasis has worsened.
Interstitial edema has improved.
Small left pleural effusion is stable.
[**2136-10-23**] EGD Findings Esophagus:  Mucosa: Grade 4 esophagitis and ulceration with stigmata of recent bleeding was seen in the gastroesophageal junction, compatible with esophagitis.
Mucosa: Localized erythema of the mucosa with no bleeding was noted in the antrum.
Mucosa: Localized erythema of the mucosa with no bleeding was noted in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis.
Other findings: The source of bleeding is most likely the esophagitis and ulceration.
Erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis.
Blood in the stomach body.
Erythema in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis.
The source of bleeding is most likely the esophagitis and ulceration.
Brief Hospital Course: 52 yo male with a history of alcohol abuse presented with hematemesis, nausea, vomiting, anuria x4 days, and acute renal failure.
Hypotension On presentation, the patient was tranienently hypotensive likely secondary to hematemesis and hypovolemia.
ABG consistent with contraction alkalosis.
Aggressive rehydration with IV fluid was started to maintain MAP>65.
Acute renal failure On admission, the patient was found to be in ARF with Cr 15.5, baseline 1.0.
Anion gap was 25, likely secondary to uremia.
Contraction alakalosis likely secondary to vomiting.
Given a finding of a renal cyst on renal U/S, there was concern of obstruction.
Urology was consulted and the patient underwent cystopscopy and retrograde pyelogram, which revealed no obsruction.
Hematemesis This was believed to be secondary to severe esophagitis and resolved on presentation.
EGD demonstrated severe esophagitis.
The patient has not had any further episodes of hemaemesis during this admission.
Toxicology screen was only positive for opiates.
Transaminitis Ratio of mildly elevated AST to ALT suggested transaminitis is seconday to alcohol abuse.
Hepatitis panel was performed and were notable for Hepatitis A antibody being positive, suggestive of prior infection.
Elevated lipase On presentation, Lipase was 100, suggesting mild alcoholic pancreatitis.
The patient had mild epigastric pain that resolved shortly thereafter with no intervention.
There were no aigns of symptoms concerning for fulminant pancreatitis.
The patient was initially maintained NPO and received IV fluids for hypotension and renal failure.
Pain resolved.
Depression and Schizoaffective Disorder According to discussion with outpatient mental health providers, the patient was restarted on risperdal and elavil.
Morphine IR 15mg PO bid prn pain 4.
Hematemesis - vomiting blood 2.
Acute Renal Failure 3.
Pneumonia  SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: 1.
Depression 3.
