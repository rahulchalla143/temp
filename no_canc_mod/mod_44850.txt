HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old female with a past medical history significant for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, asthma, seizure disorder, no prior history of coronary artery disease (despite a positive troponin I during the hospitalization two years ago), who was admitted to the CCU following an episode of hypotension, bradycardia, and hypercarbic respiratory distress requiring intravenous inotropic support and intubation.
The patient was in her usual state of health when she experienced a syncopal episode on [**8-26**].
She denied an aura preceding the pain or loss of bowel or bladder function.
She did note a brief period of disorientation following the syncopal episode.
The patient was hypotensive on arrival to the Emergency Department.
An electrocardiogram was unremarkable for ischemia with the exception of new right bundle branch block.
The patient experienced bradycardia with decreased systolic blood pressure to the 70s.
The patient developed a fever, and Levaquin was started on [**8-26**].
Vancomycin and Flagyl were initiated on [**8-28**] for persistent febrile episodes.
The patient experienced intermittent episodes of the pacer wire not catching; the amplitude was increased with good result.
Neurologic evaluation for autonomic seizures was obtained.
Previous sputum cultures from [**8-27**] and [**8-30**] also demonstrated rare oropharyngeal organisms.
There was a potential retrocardiac infiltrate on chest x-ray worrisome for pneumonia.
The most likely etiology for the patient's sepsis was from a line infection; however, no objective evidence could be obtained to support this.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Breast cancer status post right mastectomy in [**2107**], status post radiation.
Recurrent osteomyelitis status post sternotomy in [**2140**].
Chronic right pleural effusion status post pleurodesis.
ALLERGIES:  THE PATIENT GETS TREMULOUSNESS WITH AMIODARONE.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  The patient was a chronically ill-appearing female in no acute distress lying supine in bed with head at 10??????
Neck:  No jugular venous distention.
No thyromegaly.
Chest:  Well-healed sternal scar and flap.
No dullness to percussion anteriorly.
Posteriorly the patient had dullness to percussion on the left side, one-third up the lung field.
No wheezes or rhonchi appreciated.
Cardiovascular:  No RV heave.
There was a 2 out of 6 systolic crescendo-decrescendo late-peaking systolic murmur appreciated at the right upper sternal border.
The patient has a second 2 out of 6 holosystolic murmur located at the apex.
No rubs appreciated.
Extremities:  There was significant bilateral upper extremity swelling present.
The patient has 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities.
There was no cyanosis.
Neurological:  Cranial nerves were significant only for decreased hearing in the left and right ears.
Video swallow on [**2145-9-14**], demonstrated aspiration with thin liquids which was effectively countered by bolus and chin tuck.
Premature spillage with retention in ................... and piriform sinuses which had effectively been cleared with dry swallow.
Lateral decubitus film on [**2145-9-16**], showed a moderate sized left pleural effusion with only partial layering was demonstrated.
A right clavicular x-ray on [**2145-9-17**], demonstrated mid and distal clavicular cortical thickening, coarsened trabeculae which would be consistent with Paget's disease.
Transesophageal echocardiogram on [**2145-9-3**], demonstrated mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function with an ejection fraction of greater than 55%.
The left atrium was dilated, and there was no evidence of atrial thrombus in the atrial appendage.
Of note, there was mild 1+ mitral regurgitation and mild 1+ aortic regurgitation.
Bradycardia was thought to be secondary to over beta-blockade.
The patient's bradycardia continued with an underlying rhythm of atrial fibrillation.
The patient had a permanent pacemaker placed on [**2145-9-13**], without complications.
Of note, the patient underwent an atrial fibrillation ablation on [**2145-9-15**], with no further complications.
Ischemia:  The patient experienced several episodes of substernal chest pressure associated with shortness of breath and nausea while admitted.
Each episode of chest pressure led to her ruling out for myocardial infarction.
She had interval increased in her pleural effusions while admitted, especially on the left side.
The pleural effusion was evaluated by thoracentesis on [**2145-9-18**].
The pleural fluid analysis demonstrated fluid that was consistent with transudative process with the likely etiology of congestive heart failure.
This was evaluated at rest, and the patient will continue to need supplemental oxygen and further evaluation for her requirement upon optimal diuresis.
Infectious disease:  The patient was noted to have persistently febrile periods while in the Intensive Care Unit.
The most likely etiology for her sepsis was a line infection; however, no source was identified by culturing.
Heme:  The patient was noted to have a normocytic anemia.
The patient was evaluated for evidence of hemolysis several days prior to discharge which was negative.
Previous work-up of her anemia was consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
The patient will need to remain anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation.
FEN:  The patient had a video swallow while admitted to evaluate for aspiration risk.
She was noted to have oropharyngeal dysphagia which more compensated for by a chin tuck method with dry swallow.
Atrial fibrillation.
Bradycardia status post pacemaker insertion.
Congestive heart failure.
Oropharyngeal dysphagia (mild to moderate).
