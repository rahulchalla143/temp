Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 95180**] was taken directly from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital to the [**Hospital1 18**] cardiac cath lab for a large anterior STEMI.
He also was found to have a 40% lesion of his proximal LCx which was not intervened upon.
Since he had had an anterior STEMI and was thus at risk for a mural thrombus, he was maintained on a heparin drip.
Prior to discharge, he had a TTE which showed an LVEF of 35%, an LV aneurysm with possible mural thrombus, as well as focal akinesis of the anterior septum, distal anterior wall, and apex.
Due to the apical akinesis and question of mural thrombus, he is being discharged on warfarin with plans to followup with a new PCP here at [**Hospital1 18**] and the [**Hospital 191**] [**Hospital3 **].
