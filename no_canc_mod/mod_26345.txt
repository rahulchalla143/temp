The patient is a 71 year old female with a history of COPD FEV1% 61, rheumatoid arthritis and SLE on prednisone, methotrexate and etanarcept(recently held 1.5 months ago) who presented to [**Hospital3 7571**]status post a spontaneous fracture of the left femur s/p ORIF on [**3-24**] and distal pinning on [**2146-3-31**] at [**Location (un) **].
The patient has a documented history of an allergy to augmentin resulting inpresyncope, nausea and vomiting in the past, but was treated post-op with cefazolin x 3 doses.
On [**3-27**], she developed a macular rash on her back and shoulders which then spread to her palms and soles with some desquamation of the skin on her back and spread diffusely throughout her body, as well as swelling of her hands and feet.
She was evaluated by dermatology at [**Location (un) **] who felt her skin findings were may have been consistent with a drug reaction as the patient has sensitivity to Augmentin and was placed on cefazolin which has cross-reactivity with pencillins.
However, dermatology was also suspicious of other causes given that her rash appeared to be in multiple stages at that time and vesicular in nature and a Tzanck smear was obtained.
On [**2146-4-3**], the patient developed acute-onset shortness of breath with mid-sternal [**4-8**] chest pressure that resolved on its own that the patient states she believes was due to anxiety and productive cough of greenish sputum.
A VQ scan was obtained given the patient's recent insufficiency at 1.4-1.6 which was low prob for a PE in the setting of a D-dimer post-operatively of 4200.
CXR showed LLL atelectasis.
On arrival, the patient was felt to be in mild respiratory distress and placed on a high flow mask 35% FiO2 and did not require intubation.
Ortho was consulted on [**4-4**]-6 given the patient's increased LLE pain in the setting of her recent surgery.
On [**4-6**] she was transferred to to the floor on the [**Hospital Ward Name **] where she developed acute SOB again.
CXR was did not reveal CHF or PNA and a CTA was performed to r/o PE.
It was negative for PE but did reveal b/l pleural effusions with atelectasis and emphysema and questionable small area of devloping PNA, and an Echo with Ef>55%, normal RV size and motionShe as strted on levo/flagyl and continued on nebs with significant improvemnt in her O2 sats to 95 % on 6 L FM.
RA on chronic low dose prednisone, methotrexate and etanercept which was held recently secondary to bacterial sinusitis and ORIF *SLE with no known renal involvement, on chronic prednisone 2.
Raynaud's syndrome ?
Osteoporosis with spontaneous rib fractures in [**2143**] 4.
Hiatal Hernia 7.
Chronic anemia, on folate, B12, colonoscopy normal 3-4 years ago, SPEP, UPEP negative 10. exercise stress test that per the patient were negative as well as multiple ED-ROMIs.
Heart - RRR, no m/g/r Lung - CTAB Abdomen - Soft, NT, ND, + BS, no hepatosplenomegaly Ext - incision site C/D/I, 2+ LE edema b/l, right hand 1st digit DIP with RA nodules as well as 4th digit PIP.
Pertinent Results: [**4-4**] Femur Xray: There is complex comminuted fracture of the proximal femur, with lateral apex angulation of the proximal fragment, with somewhat unusual alignment.
There is subcutaneous air abutting the distal femur.
IMPRESSION: Status post fixation of comminuted fracture of the proximal femur with proximal lateral apex angulation with somewhat unusual alignment.
[**4-6**] CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There is a left-sided central venous line.
The esophagus is mildly dilated and fluid filled.
No pneumothorax.
There are bilateral small pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
There are severe emphysematous changes of the lungs.
There is an ill-defined right lower lobe opacity.
There is biapical scarring and a left apical bleb.
There are multiple right- sided rib fractures.
No pneumothorax is seen.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Severe emphysema.
Bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis.
Multiple right-sided rib fractures that were also present on [**2146-4-4**].
No pneumothorax identified.
There is ill-defined opacity in the right lower lobe, possibly representing an early pneumonia.
[**4-7**] TTE Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
Note is made of old healed rib fractures on the right.
The two nodular opacities seen in the right base are likely due to vasculature since there is no corresponding pulmonary abnormality on the recent CT scan dated [**2146-4-4**].
IMPRESSION: Diffuse emphysema, no evidence of acute pulmonary disease.
Right-sided rib fractures.
There is minimal atelectasis or scarring at the left lung base.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Multiple bilateral healed rib fractures are noted.
IMPRESSION: Left base scarring or atelectasis.
No acute process.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 71 yo F with COPD, RA, SLE s/p femur fracture and ORIF with significant residual displacement s/p redo [**4-15**], s/p several admissions to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory distress with tachypnea now with respiratory distress again with tachypnea, hypoxia, unclear etiology and trigger.
She was treated for a COPD flare as chest x-ray was negative for CHF and pneumonia.
The patient was ruled out PE with CTA of chest but showed b/l pleural effusions with atelectasis and emphysema and ?small area of developing PNA.
She was extubated the next day but remained tachypneic with O2 sats improved to 95% on 6L FM and was started empirically on Levo/Flagyl for ?PNA and completed course on [**4-15**] (8 day course).
Pulmonary team was consulted regarding ongoing hypoxemia and diff dx still included persistent mild CHF, fat emboli, or mucus plugging and recommended continued diuresis and IS.
Pt had left femoral revision on [**4-15**], was intubated for surgery and extubated without event and actually seemed improved per floor team with pain meds.
While on the floor, pt has been increasingly tachypneic with persistent mild non-productive cough and over the last day increased accessory muscle use.
CXR revealed no CHF or infiltrates.
Her respiratory distress was thought to be more likely secondary to mucous plugging and anxiety as pt was able to breathe better after coughing up thick mucous sputum and placed on haldol for anxiety.
ENT was also consulted given her respiratory distress,intubation and hoarse voice and noted sluggish R vocal cord and recommended decadron, nasal saline spray for 2 weeks and avoiding nasal cannula at all costs.
The patient passed speech and swallow and can tolerate regular PO diet.
Left hip wound need to be monitored for any signs of infection.
Femoral Fracture: s/p left femoral nail revision fixation left femur subtrochanteric fracture without complications on [**4-15**].
Continue pain control with pain med/prn.
Haloperidol Lactate 5 mg/mL Solution Sig: 2.5 mg Injection [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
Respiratory distress 2.
COPD exacerbation 4.
Rheumatoid Arthritis 7.
SLE 8. s/p L femoral fracture and revision of ORIF 9.
Chronic anemia   Discharge Condition: Stable, on high flow humidified O2 mask for comfort   Discharge Instructions: Please see extensive d/c summary re: medications and plan of care.
