Admission Date:  [**2147-9-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2147-9-20**]    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88 year old female with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and diabetes mellitus who presented with fever, abdominal pain after being found down at her nursing home.
Her history patient is a resident at [**Hospital3 2558**] who was found status post questionable fall the morning of admission and was noted to have a left-sided weakness without head trauma or loss of consciousness.
Subsequently the patient had a large occult blood positive stool and was also found to have complaints of abdominal pain.
In the Emergency Department the patient was found to have an increased respiratory rate.
She denied cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting or dysuria.
She did complain of abdominal pain and diarrhea.
The patient denied any fevers or chills prior though it is unclear but it is possibly p.o.
intake had been decreased for several days.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, status post congestive heart failure with last admission in [**2144-4-5**] for diastolic heart failure, Type 2 diabetes, dementia, benign positional vertigo, status post cholecystectomy, status post femoral neck fracture on the right with a hemiarthroplasty, chronic anemia with hematocrit of 29 and B12 deficiency.
ALLERGIES:  Benzodiazepine which causes severe agitation.
The patient was an awake, alert, tachypneic elderly white female in mild distress.
Neck was supple with jugulovenous distension of 10 cm, no lymphadenopathy.
Lungs with decreased breath sounds bilaterally anteriorly at the bases, otherwise clear to auscultation.
Abdomen was diffusely tender with bowel sounds, no masses, no organomegaly and mild distention.
Back examination, positive costovertebral angle tenderness bilaterally per Emergency Department.
Extremities with 1+ pitting bilaterally with no edema.
Left hip with 5 cm erythematous abrasion, no pelvic instability, no pain to passive range of motion of the left hip.
Left arm, flaccid, no response to pain.
Left leg withdraws to pain but also flaccid.
Base x-ray on [**9-8**] revealed a right lower lobe opacity with atelectasis and probable pneumonia.
Computerized tomography scan on [**9-8**] revealed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Computerized tomography scan of the abdomen on [**9-8**] revealed a small right pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis right greater than left with dense vascular calcification.
There was a large hiatal hernia, nonspecific large bowel wall thickening without stranding or pneumatosis which could not exclude bowel ischemia, probable sacral myelocele was there as well.
Computerized tomography scan of the cervical spine on [**9-8**] revealed degenerative joint disease without evidence of acute fracture.
Given her high troponin levels, Cardiology was seen in consultation and they felt that it was not appropriate to cardiac catheterize the patient at that time.
Given her history of large bloody stool, the patient was not deemed a candidate for heparinization either.
During her course in the hospital the patient did continue to have transient chest pain which was often relieved by Nitroglycerin but no electrocardiogram changes were found.
Some episodes of chest pain did have to be treated with 1 mg of intravenous morphine.
The patient was placed on Nitropaste to provide longterm pain relief and the patient's episodes of chest pain subsided.
Infectious Disease - The patient was seen to have probable sepsis with several possible etiologies including the possibility of ischemic bowel as indicated by the computerized tomography scan as above, infectious colitis and urosepsis.
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**9-9**] for an exploratory laparotomy to rule out ischemic bowel and it was ruled out by this procedure.
Please see the operative note dictation for further details of this procedure.
After an acceptable course of antibiotic therapy for her urosepsis and pneumonia these were discontinued and the diarrhea did resolve.
The patient did receive a transfusion of 4 units of packed red blood cells over her stay in the hospital due to a low hematocrit and her history of coronary artery disease and recent myocardial infarction.
Renal - The patient did have acid based abnormalities with a respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis likely lactic acidosis secondary to sepsis with an anion gap.
There was no evidence of ketones.
The patient's renal failure was attributed to prerenal azotemia and she was hydrated to relieve this.
It was felt that sepsis and/or ischemia may be unmasking left-sided weakness.
The patient's weakness did resolve.
Gastrointestinal - The patient was admitted with bloody diarrhea as described above.
The workup above was undertaken and in addition further computerized tomography scans were obtained after the patient was transferred from the Medicine Intensive Care Unit to the General Medical Floor because of ongoing diarrhea.
One of these abdominal computerized tomography scans revealed a small well circumscribed lesion in the pancreas.
The question was raised as to whether or not the patient may be experiencing pancreatitis and the patient was maintained on a BRAT diet, lipase levels declined.
An abdominal ultrasound on [**9-19**] revealed no additional changes in this lesion.
Genitourinary - One of the aforementioned computerized tomography scans also revealed a fluid-filled uterus.
This was reviewed with the Gynecology Consult Service and they recommended the patient have an outpatient uterine biopsy.
They felt that there were no urgency to working up this problem at this time.
Diarrhea subsided.
The patient was also seen by the Speech and Swallow Service who felt that the patient could tolerate ground food given her swallowing problems.
The patient also developed a urinary tract infection with yeast.
Myocardial infarction 2.
Left-sided weakness 3.
Lactic acidosis 4.
Pneumonia 6.
