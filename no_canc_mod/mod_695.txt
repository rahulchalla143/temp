At l3, the patient was seen at [**Hospital3 1810**] for history of syncope, chest pain and progressive exercise intolerance.
She was found to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
At age l6, she experienced cardiac arrest secondary to complex tachycardia.

not withdrawing to pain or sternal rub.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP); -76 BY SAME PHYSICIAN [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of right-sided parenchymal opacity is minimally resolving.
No newly appeared parenchymal opacities.
Newly placed right chest tube sideport appears outside of the hemithorax with reduced right effusion noted.
There is bilateral vascular engorgement and perihilar opacities, greater on the right.
A small right pleural effusion has developed or increased in size.
Interval development of moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.
ECG Study Date of [**2121-5-18**]  4:46:36 PM Probable sinus rhythm with a sinusoidal pattern consistent with severe hyperkalemia or agonal rhythm.
ECG Study Date of [**2121-5-18**]  5:08:10 PM Probable sinus rhythm with a sinusoidal [**Doctor Last Name 5926**] consistent with severe hyperkalemia or agonal rhythm.
Compared to the previous tracing there is no significant change.
ECG Study Date of [**2121-5-18**]  5:14:06 PM Probable ectopic atrial rhythm.
The QRS is profoundly prolonged consistent with severe hyperkalemia.
Compared to the previous tracing agonal rhythm is no longer present.
The QRS duration is profoundly prolonged consistent with severe hyperkalemia.
Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing multiple severe abnormalities have improved.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
The right-sided parenchymal opacification persists, as does the retrocardiac opacification consistent with atelectasis and effusion.
Unchanged position of the right-sided chest tube, the side port of the chest tube is still in the thoracic wall and slightly outside the lung.
No evidence of pleural effusions.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2121-5-1**], the magnitude of tricuspid regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure have decreased.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing there is no significant change.
Peaked P waves consistent with right atrial enlargement.
Right bundle-branch block.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2121-5-21**] 11:19 AM PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The heart remains enlarged, and there are new, ill-defined airspace opacities at both bases, most likely due to edema given the rapid time appearance.
A focus of linear opacity in the left lung base is likely atelectasis.
The upper lung zones remain relatively well aerated with no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Interval increase in pulmonary edema, with persistent cardiomegaly and fluid overload.
ECG Study Date of [**2121-5-22**]  4:45:32 AM Coarse atrial fibrillation.
Minimal left axis deviation with right bundle-branch block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2121-5-20**] atrial fibrillation has replaced normal sinus rhythm.
Coarse atrial fibrillation is stated by some to be more frequent with valvular heart disease than coronary heart disease.
ECG Study Date of [**2121-5-23**]  3:17:28 AM Coarse atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Left axis deviation with probable left anterior fascicular block.

TRACING #3  Brief Hospital Course: 34 yo woman with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, multifocal atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation/flutter, h/o AVNRT, with multiple previous cardiac arrests with PEA arrest, likely [**3-15**] hyperkalemia.
# s/p PEA arrest: Etiologies include hyperkalemia, vs. other acidosis which precipated hyperkalemia.
patient has been hypokalemic since admission, and has required K supplements.
The lines were removed after two days, once her INR was reversed with IV vitamin K. She did not develop any ekg findings suggestive of hyperkalemia throughout her hospitalization.
She did not develop any further episodes of ventricular tachycardia throughout her hospitalization.
# Fluid Status: Patient was total body fluid overloaded throughout her hospitalization, requiring IV lasix to improve urine output.
Her lasix dosing was increased to 80mg PO BID on [**5-26**], as she still had an oxygen requirement and was still reporting edematous extremities.
# Rhythm.
History of multiple atrial tachyarrhythmias s/p recent failed ablation.
the patient developed atrial flutter on [**5-21**].
An ablation was considered to be unnecessary at this time given her history of complications with procedures.
CXR showing possible RLL opacity vs. fluid overload.
had persistent leukocytosis at previous admission, s/p 10 day course with aztreonam and clinda, finished on [**2121-5-19**].

Shortly after presentation you were found to be in cardiac arrest, possibly secondary to elevated potassium.
[**Last Name (STitle) 5861**], or your cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], or return to the emergency department if you experience palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, loss of consciousness, fever greater than 101.5 degrees F, or any other symptoms that concern you.
