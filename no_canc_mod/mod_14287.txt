Chlamydia negative.
Pregnancy was complicated by placental abruption.
She was admitted on [**8-10**] for vaginal hemorrhage and preterm labor, at which time she received betamethasone and tocolysis and was discharged home several days later.
She was readmitted on [**8-16**] and, on the day of delivery, progressed to repeat cesarean section for recurrent hemorrhage.
Rupture of membranes at time of delivery yielded clear amniotic fluid.
There was no antepartum fever or other clinical evidence of chorioamnionitis.
There was no intrapartum antibiotic therapy.
Infant established spontaneous respirations rapidly, with onset of mild subcostal retractions at 5 to 10 minutes of life.
Chest notable for mild subcostal retractions.
Intermittent mild grunting respirations.
Bilateral breath sounds with good aeration.
No organomegaly, no masses.
HOSPITAL COURSE: Respiratory:  Initially, the baby presented with mild respiratory distress.
Respiratory rate initially was notable for tachypnea with respiratory rate in the 80's which resolved over the first few days of life; now is in the normal range with comfortable breathing pattern.
Occasional apnea of prematurity was noted.
Baby was noted to have some occasional reflux and feeds were extended over a period of one hour.
This came back with an elevated tyrosine level at greater than 79.
Additional laboratory studies were obtained to determine whether this was tyrosinemia type I, type II or type III.
In type I tyrosinemia, the urine succinyl acetone is elevated and this ruled out type I tyrosinemia.
Gastrointestinal:  Baby had physiologic jaundice and received phototherapy from day two with a peak serum bilirubin of 11.2 over 0.3 on day of life three.
On [**9-17**] and [**9-18**], a serum bilirubin was obtained for clinical jaundice and was found to be 12.4 over 0.3, likely representing breast milk jaundice at this time.
Hematology:  Baby had an initial CBC drawn upon admission to the newborn Intensive Care Unit, revealing a white count of 11.3 with 15 polys and 0 bands; hematocrit 48.4 percent and platelets of 203,000.
With chronic lung disease.
Before this age, and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out of home caregivers.
Due to the breech presentation, hip ultrasound is recommended to screen for developmental dysplasia of the hip.
Physiologic jaundice.
Breech presentation with risk for developmental dysplasia of the hips.
