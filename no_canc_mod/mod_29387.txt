Post-op CT showed removal of SDH and improved midline shift.
On [**9-17**] pt developped HTN, tachycardia, abd pain and distention.
A KUB showed colonic ileus, then on [**9-18**] a bedside rectal tube was inserted by surgical team.
A CT abd showed no evidence of volvulus, bowel obstruction, free air or pneumatosis.
Constipation was thought possibly due to Ogilvies Syndrome.
Medicine was consulted for persistent HTN and tachycardia.
Labetalol was increased and hypertension was better controlled.
Pt was transferred to medical team for further management of HTN & tachycardia.
1. s/p Sub dural hematoma evacuation.
Neuro exam remained stable, pt did c/o right sided HA on [**9-23**] and repeat head CT showed no interval rebleed and hematoma was resolving.
Pt was continued on Dilantin per Neurosurgery recommendations for post operative seizure prophylaxis.
# Her hypertension was much better controlled on Labetalol 300mg TID.
# Pt was mildly tachycardic without evidence of hypovolemia, this seemed to resolve with increased Labetalol and after Psych was consulted.
It is possible that her anxiety was contributing to the tachycardia because it was not present when her anxiety was better controlled.
There has been no evidence of obstruction/constipation for more that 3 days now and pt has been taking good PO without nausea.
# Pt had a UTI with a urine culture positive for E. Coli sensitve to Cipro.
She has completed a seven day course of Cipro, has been afebrile and asymptomatic.
# Pt has evidence of anemia of chronic disease that has been stable, she also has a history of hypercholesterolemia and was continued on her home dose of Simvastatin.
# Pt with h/o Hypothyroidism was continued on home dose of Levothyroxine.
They felt her mental illness was stable with no current evidence of depression.
They did not feel there was any urgency to restart her Clomipramine and wanted her to follow up with her outpatient psychiatrist after discharge to discuss restarting these medications.
They did not want to change the Dilantin as neurosurgery felt it was important for seizure prophylaxis.
# Pt was noted to have a mildly elevated Alk Phos and LDH.
There was evidence of cholelithiasis on CT but there has never been any RUQ pain on exam and no elevation in T Bili.
This also could have been a result of the resolving subdural vs postoperative cholestasis.
Her LFTs will need to be followed up as a out patient and she should be followed for any symptoms of cholecystitis.
