Admission Date:  [**2159-11-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-12-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-6-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Shellfish  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5868**] Chief Complaint: Acute Stroke, s/p IV t-PA   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: IV TPA  History of Present Illness: 74 year old man with hx of CAD (s/p MI, s/p CABG), HTN, Right carotid stenosis (s/p carotid stent [**10-5**]), and arthritis who presented to the ED on [**11-25**] complaining of left sided weakness.
A code stroke was called and the stroke fellow assessed the patient immediately (Please see Dr.[**Name (NI) 105059**] note [**11-25**] for details of initial assessment).
He was initially found to have an NIHSS of 9.
At that time, he was able to use both hands to hold the book and had no difficulty turning the pages.
He was noted to have a left visual field cut, dysarthria, left sided inattention, left facial droop, left hemiplegia (arm>leg) and left hemisensory deficit.
He denies having similar symptoms in the past.
COPD 3.
HTN 4.
High cholesterol 5.
Family History: Brother - stroke [**Name2 (NI) 6419**] parents had heart disease in their 60s.
Physical Exam: T-96.6 BP-155/103 HR-72 RR-20 O2Sat-100 Gen: Lying in bed, NAD HEENT: NC/AT, facial rubor, moist oral mucosa Neck: No tenderness to palpation, normal ROM, no carotid bruits CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, [**2-4**] HSM Lung: Decreased breath sounds throughout aBd: +BS soft, nontender ext: no edema Neurologic examination: Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal affect.
Moderate dysarthria.
No visual field cut, +extinction to visual DSS III, IV, VI: Right gaze preference, but extraocular movements full bilaterally, no nystagmus.
V: Sensation decreased to LT and pin on left V1-V3 VII: Left lower facial palsy, also some weakness of orbicularis occuli on the left-though forehead moves symmetrically.
No observed myoclonus or tremor Left drift    [**Doctor First Name **] Tri [**Hospital1 **]  WF WE FE FF  IP  H  Q DF PF TE TF R  5   5   5  5  5  5  5   5   5  5  5  5  5  4+ L  5-  5   5  3  2  1  2   5-  5  5  5  5  5  4+  Sensation: Intact to light touch, pinprick on right, decreased by (?50%) on left.

Gait/Romberg: Unable to assess  Pertinent Results: 7.1>37.8<197  73N 17L 5E Na 143  K 4.0  Cl 106  CO2 25  BUN 20  Cr 1.1  Glu 112 Ca 9.4  Mg 1.7  Ph 3.6 Lip 43 PT 12.8  PTT 23.3  INR 1.1 A1C 5.2 Chol 155  TG 110  HDL 69  LDL 64 U/A neg  Head CT [**11-25**] - Abrupt cut-off of the anterior division of the right middle cerebral artery (M3), consistent with acute occlusive thrombus or embolus.
No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Head CT [**11-26**] and [**12-3**] - Stable head CT with evidence of evolving right middle cerebral artery territory infarct, without definite hemorrhage.
MRI head [**11-25**] - Large area of restricted diffusion in the right middle cerebral artery territory in the right frontal and temporal lobes, consistent with acute infarct.
MR [**First Name (Titles) 4058**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4579**]s significantly decreased flow in the right mid cerebral artery branches  Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**11-26**] - Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Carotid ultrasound [**11-28**] - Minimal plaque on the right with a less than 40% carotid stenosis.
On the left, there is moderate plaque with a 40-59% stenosis.
Neck MRA [**11-27**] - Patent right internal carotid artery stent but with apparent slow flow.
Signal irregularity and apparent diminutive flow through the stent could be secondary to magnetic susceptibility from the stent, intimal hyperplasia, or a small amount of thrombus.
Preliminarily transesophageal echocardiogram:  simple atheroma in descending aorta  Brief Hospital Course: 74 year old man with hx of CAD, HTN, high cholesterol, smoking, s/p recent right carotid stent, and family hx of stroke who presents with acute onset of left sided weakness.
Initial exam notable for left sided inattention, dysarthria, left facial, left sided weakness (primarily in arm with cortical hand), left sided sensory deficit to all modalities, left sided cortical sensory loss.
He was admitted to the neuro ICU after receiving tPA; MRI/A showed M2 or M3 occlusion, no recannulization.
Neuro - Stroke was most likely related to embolism from stent thrombus.
The target is for low INR around 2.
Exam remains most notable for dysarthria, L hemiplegia and L extinction to double simultaneous stimulation.
CV - Ruled out for MI upon admission.
HTN now controlled on Metoprolol.
No events on telemetry.
TEE performed on [**12-5**] prelim read: simple atheroma in descending aorta, moderately thick aortic valve, no ASD or PFO (final report pending).
FEN/GI - Pt failed initial swallow evaluations, requiring tube feeds through [**12-3**].
Heme - Should start Coumadin 2.5mg QHS on [**12-5**], goal INR ~2 (low therapeutic goal as Pt will also be on Aspirin and Plavix and would be at high risk for bleeding with higher INR).
Seek medical attention for worsened weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, sudden change in vision/hearing, severe headache, seizure, or for other concerns.
