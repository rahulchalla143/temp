Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated left main and two vessel coronary artery disease in the left coronary system.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
The last two stents were placed after development of slow flow and concern for a dissection after the LCx stent was placed.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
