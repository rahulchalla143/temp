HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81-year-old man with a past medical history significant for hypertension, COPD, status post multiple hospitalizations for this in the recent few months, new onset atrial fibrillation, alcohol abuse, moderate aortic stenosis, who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2151-3-23**] with a COPD flare after being discharged two weeks prior with a  COPD flare.
At that time, the patient's symptoms were cough, productive yellow sputum, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing.
In the Emergency Room, at the outside hospital, chest x-ray showed acute infiltrate superimposed on chronic right middle lobe infiltrate.
One month prior to admission, a right pleural based mass was seen.
The patient was initially treated with Levaquin for community-acquired pneumonia as well as steroids for a COPD exacerbation; however, he grew MRSA in his sputum culture on [**2151-4-12**].
In addition, he had new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response that was treated with Diltiazem and then loaded with Amiodarone.
This led to a likely rate-induced ischemia with peak troponin I to 0.54.
Of note, he had Guaiac positive diarrhea two days after admission prior to starting anticoagulation.
There were no further Guaiac stools at that time.
On [**2151-4-12**], he had an episode of hypoxia with P02 66.8, PC02 58, saturating 92% on a nonrebreather mask.
He was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of his hypoxia and questionable lung mass.
Moderate aortic stenosis with a reported valve area of 0.9.
New onset atrial fibrillation.
Questionable right lower lobe mass versus round atelectasis.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
He also has a history of asbestos exposure.
HEENT:  Significant for a lesion in the middle of his upper lip that had irregular borders, nontender.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm with a III/VI holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border heard throughout the precordium.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender with active bowel sounds, right lower quadrant scar from appendectomy.
Extremities:  No cyanosis or clubbing, [**2-23**]+ edema to the mid thigh bilaterally, small weeping ulcer on left lower extremity.
Chest x-ray showed a right middle lobe and right lower lobe opacity.
HYPOXIA:  The patient's hypoxia was felt to be multifactorial given the patient's history of congestive heart failure, COPD, recent rapid atrial fibrillation, and multilobar MRSA pneumonia.
It was felt that he was not in acute flare during his ICU course.
For the patient's congestive heart failure, he was gently diuresed in the setting of his aortic stenosis.
An echocardiogram was obtained which showed an ejection fraction of greater than 55%, pulmonary artery pressure of 20 mmHg, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild 1+ aortic regurgitation, and moderate aortic stenosis with mild dilation of the ascending aorta.
The patient's oxygen requirement decreased with continued diuresis.
The patient was also continued on treatment of his multilobar pneumonia with IV vancomycin at 1 gram q.
The patient also had a CAT scan to follow-up on history of lung mass and asbestos exposure.
CAT scan showed no pleural mass but loculated fluid in the minor fissure that is somewhat mass-like in appearance.
There were emphysematous changes.
There was also bilateral air space opacities in the mid lower lungs, right greater than left with some nodular appearance.
There were multiple sites of mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral calcified plaques consistent with asbestos exposure.
An abdominal aortic aneurysm was also noted infrarenally at 3.7 cm.
The patient remained afebrile during this admission and his white count was within normal limits as well.
QUESTIONABLE RIGHT LOWER LOBE MASS:  There was no mass seen on chest CT here, however, there was lymphadenopathy that could be consistent with infectious reaction.
However, it was felt that lymphadenopathy should be followed-up in three months with a CAT scan.
PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient's weight was well controlled during his admission until [**2151-4-17**] when he went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response to the 120s.
His hypoxia slightly worsened at this time and thus a Diltiazem drip was started.
Diltiazem with slow titration upwards.
It was thought that a calcium channel blocker would be a better choice in this patient with COPD as opposed to metoprolol.
The patient's rhythm oscillated between normal sinus as well as rate-controlled atrial fibrillation on day prior to floor transfer.
The patient's echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of greater than 55% with no marked left atrial dilation.
QUESTIONABLE HYPOTHYROIDISM:  The patient's TSH was elevated during his Intensive Care Unit course; however, his free T4 was normal.
SKIN LESION:  The patient's skin lesion superior to his lip looked worrisome for malignancy and thus a dermatology consult was obtained.
Dermatology felt quite certain that the patient's lesion was a squamous cell carcinoma.
METABOLIC ALKALOSIS:  The patient suffered a metabolic alkalosis during his ICU course.
It was felt that this was likely due to diuresis.
However, he did have a mild respiratory acidosis as well.
Diltiazem was also started in the setting of his rapid atrial fibrillation.
There were no acute issues.
ANEMIA:  During the inpatient hospital course at [**Hospital1 **] it was noted that he had Guaiac positive stools with the need of 2 units of packed red blood cells.
The patient's hematocrit was stable during his ICU course requiring no transfusions.
He was Guaiac positive here.
Iron studies showed an anemia of chronic disease picture, however, it is hard to interpret in the setting of recent transfusions.
