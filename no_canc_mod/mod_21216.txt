Admission Date:  [**2100-12-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2101-1-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2039-6-16**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year old man with known three vessel coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25 to 30% who had a planned coronary artery bypass grafting scheduled for the morning of admission when he was noted to be acutely short of breath while undressing in the Preoperative Holding Area.
He had no associated chest pain.
He subsequently diuresed 1100 cc and had symptomatic improvement.
He had noted one month history of increasing dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea and had been admitted to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital in early [**Month (only) 1096**] with similar symptoms.
An echocardiogram at that time revealed an ejection fraction of 40% with global hypokinesis and a catheterization reportedly showed three vessel disease for which he was then transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**]  on [**2100-12-2**].
His initial workup showed troponin of .56 and a chest x-ray with bilateral effusion and a left upper lobe infiltrate.
He was started on beta blocker, ACE inhibitor and heparin and received Levaquin for a urinary tract infection plus a possible pneumonia.
Due to his infection, his coronary artery bypass graft was subsequently deferred at that time and since he had a history of stable angina he was discharged to home at that time to return for elective surgery.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25 to 30% by echocardiogram on [**2100-12-1**], borderline hypertension, recent urinary tract infection on last admission and recent pneumonia on last admission.
He is not married and has no children.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for positive dyspnea on exertion, positive orthopnea, positive dry cough, no fevers or chills or urinary frequency and no dysuria.
He has no bruits.
His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally and heart is regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 with no murmur, rub or gallop.
His abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
His extremities showed 2+ pitting edema to the mid calf with 2+ dorsalis pedis and 2+ posterior tibialis pulses.
His electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 119 beats/minute with T wave inversions in V5 and V6 which were old and [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V1.
His chest x-ray showed low lung volumes, positive for mild congestive heart failure and positive for bilateral effusions.
On the evening of admission he was noted to have a brief run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia consisting of five beats during which he was stable and asymptomatic.
On [**2100-12-30**], he had transthoracic cardiac echocardiogram which showed 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation which was unchanged from previous echocardiogram and an ejection fraction of about 25%.
Later that night he was noted to have a ten beat run and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia during which he was asymptomatic with stable vital signs.
The surgery was performed under general endotracheal anesthesia with a cardiopulmonary bypass time of 123 minutes and a cross-clamp time of 91 minutes.
By postoperative day #1, his Milrinone was weaned off and he was started on Amiodarone drip for brief runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
By postoperative day #2, he continued on his Amiodarone drip to help prevent further ectopy and required Levophed for blood pressure support.
Chest x-ray performed on postoperative day #4 showed mild to moderate left pleural effusion.
He continued with diuresis and repeat chest x-ray on postoperative day #5 showed slight improvement in this effusion and it was felt that the patient was ready to be discharged to home with the [**Hospital6 1587**] services.
His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
q.d., this is due to poor targets for bypass grafts.
q.d., also due to poor targets for his bypass graft.
for four days as the patient was exposed to a patient who tested positive for influenza.
Congestive heart failure.
