Admission Date:  [**2103-2-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2103-3-8**]   Service:  Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year old male who presented in [**2102-10-21**] with adenocarcinoma of the distal stomach.
The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility but returned to an outside hospital with severe diarrhea and severe metabolic acidosis.
Exploration was negative for intra-abdominal pathology and jejunostomy tube was placed at that operation.
The patient's postoperative course was complicated by a myocardial infarction with a troponin peak of 17.
On postoperative day number three, the patient was noted to have an increasing volume requirement and an increasing white blood cell count.
A couple of days later, he developed bilious drainage from the inferior pole of his wound.
The patient was transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for management of his enterocutaneous fistula.
Status post right cerebrovascular accident with left hemiparesis.
The patient was intubated but alert with coarse breath sounds anteriorly.
His heart rate was regular but tachycardiac and he had diffuse tenderness with positive bowel sounds but no guarding.
He had a midline incision with copious bilious drainage from the inferior pole.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course for the next week consisted mainly of percutaneous drainage of three fluid collections, one on the right side, on the liver was percutaneously drained at the outside hospital and this drain continued to drain bilious material.
Another fluid collection in the left upper quadrant was also percutaneously drained by interventional radiation.
A left lower quadrant fluid collection was also percutaneously tapped but this was only aspirated as it only had serous material.
Fistulas were not characterized and we decided to take him to the Operating Room on [**2103-3-6**] for exploration and attempt at surgical control of the fistulas.
The patient was stable in the intraoperative period but, in the postoperative period, developed frequent runs of rapid atrial fibrillation with an unstable blood pressure.
During the next couple of days, the patient developed an increasing volume requirement, increased acidosis and subsequently became progressively hypotensive, requiring escalating doses of pressors.
Enterocutaneous fistula, status post exploratory laparotomy with closure of colotomy and revision of gastrojejunostomy and enteric resection 2.
Multi-system organ failure and septic shock.
Status post distal gastric resection for adenocarcinoma of the stomach with Roux-en-Y reconstruction.
