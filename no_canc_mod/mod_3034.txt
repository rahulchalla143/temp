[**2148-1-24**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): The cardiac silhouette size is unchanged, and appears mildly enlarged.
Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable, and there is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
There are mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**2148-1-24**] EEG: This is an abnormal EEG because of moderate diffuse background slowing as well as nearly continuous bifrontal slowing and occasional triphasic waves.
These findings are indicative of moderate diffuse encephalopathy which is etiologically non-specific.
The finding of diffuse triphasic waves suggest a metabolic component (as is seen in hepatic or renal failure) contributing to the patient's encephalopathy.
Brief Hospital Course: 63 yo male history of dHF and NASH Cirrhosis admitted for persistent abdominal distention and pain, hospital course complicated by intubation for unresponsive state secondary to hypoglycemia, now s/p paracentesis x2.
ACTIVE ISSUES:  # Hypoglycemia/T2DM: On morning of [**1-24**], pt was found unresponsive and code blue was called.
Most likely a result of poor PO intake with continued insulin therapy.
Per report of family, he has been found unresponsive before, and he may be having repeated hypoglycemic episodes.
No evidence of hepatic encephalopathy.
No falls on floor or history of head trauma since admission.
EKG without acute abnormality during code situation.
# Increasing ascites/Abdominal Pain: He presented complaining of weight gain, abdominal distention, and diffuse discomfort.
He was continued on ceftriaxone during his hospitalization but since no infection was proven, was not discharged on any antibiotics.
# Allergies: continued fexofenadine  # Hx of PE: Warfarin was held so that INR could get <2 for IR guided paracentesis.
# Atypical depression: continued prozac, abilify, provigil  # OSA: CPAP  Medications on Admission: torsemide 20 mg Tab 4 Tablet(s) by mouth daily fexofenadine 60 mg Tab 1 Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day Provigil 200 mg Tab 1.5 Tablets by mouth in the am, one tab at noon Oxsoralen Ultra 10 mg Cap 3 Capsule(s) by mouth prior to treatment Abilify 15 mg Tab 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily Zetia 10 mg Tab 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily sennosides-docusate sodium 8.6 mg-50 mg 1 Tablet once a day eplerenone 25 mg Tab 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily quinapril 10 mg Tab 1 Tablet(s) by mouth twice daily Humulin R U-500 55UNITS three times a day with meals Vitamin D 50,000 unit Cap 1 (One) Capsule(s) by mouth once a WEEK aspirin 81 mg Chewable Tab 1 Tablet(s) by mouth DAILY omega-3 fatty acids 1,000 mg Cap (dose uncertain) Simvastatin 10 mg Tab 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily omeprazole 20 mg Cap, Delayed Release 1 Capsule(s) by mouth [**Hospital1 **],  potassium chloride ER 20 mEq Tab 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily oxycodone 5 mg Tab 1 Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day for pain warfarin 5 mg Tab 1 Tablet(s) by mouth once a day multivitamin Cap 1 (One) Capsule(s) by mouth once a day Miralax 17 gram Oral Powder Packet (dose uncertain) Prozac 20 mg Cap 1 Capsule(s) by mouth daily  Discharge Medications: 1. fexofenadine 60 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day).

You were found to have worsening of your ascites.
You underwent intubation and resuscitation, thought to be due to a dangerously low blood sugar.
No infection was proven in your abdomen, and so you will not take antibiotics at home.
