Over the past 5 days, she again developed nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and liquid output from her ostomy.
She felt slightly better last night and had dinner, but then had recurrence of her abdominal pain.
She also had the new onset of shortness of breath.
Also reports poor urine output x 1 day.
CXR was reportedly clear with possible linear atelectasis.
UA showed WBC and bacteria, but at her baseline.
There was concern for PE given her SOB/hypoxia and paralysis, and she was empirically started on a heparin gtt for PE (no CTA given ARF).
She had a large amount of emesis (1L) and her shortness of breath resolved.
She had a renal ultrasound that showed no hydronephrosis and nephrostomy tubes in place.
LENIs were negative for DVT.
She was signed out to OMED, and then became hypotensive to the 80's/40's.
She was started on levophed and SBP increased to the 130's.
Currently, she has no complaints--she states that her ileostomy output increased shortly after her arrival to the [**Location (un) 620**] ED and that her abdominal pain symptoms began to resolve gradually since then.
She states that her abdominal pain is currently at baseline and that she would like to start advancing her diet.

Past Medical History: ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: # Rectal cancer: - late [**2139**]: 6 months of intermittent rectal bleeding, rectal pressure and a sensation of incomplete emptying.
- [**2141-1-26**]: colonoscopy revealed a polyp in her sigmoid colon and a 2.5 cm distal rectal mass arising from the anal verge in the posterior rectum with a large area of induration.
- [**2141-1-31**]: CT torso revealed an exophytic rectal mass measuring 4.8 x 3.8 cm, bulging posteriorly into the presacral space and anteriorly towards the uterus.
There were enlarged lymph nodes in the perirectal fat adjacent to the mass, a 9-mm enhancing lymph node in the left pelvic sidewall, and enhancing lymph nodes in the right external iliac region.
There were at least four abnormal perirectal lymph nodes seen on MRI, in addition to multiple bilateral enlarged pelvic sidewall lymph nodes, concerning for extensive disease.
- [**2141-2-20**]: began chemoradiation - [**2141-3-10**]: 5-FU was discontinued due to mucositis, neutropenia, and abdominal cramping - [**2141-3-13**]: 5-FU was restarted at a reduced dose - [**2141-3-22**]: 5-FU was again stopped due to mucositis, perirectal skin changes, diarrhea, and electrolyte abnormalities.
- [**2141-5-31**]: found to be HIV positive and began on HAART - [**Date range (1) 70846**]: required hospitalization for an SBO, underwent laparotomy, ileocecectomy, end-ileostomy, and placement of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] tube on [**2141-6-16**].
Pathology from this surgery revealed severe radiation-induced acute ischemic enteritis.
- [**7-/2141**]: Once her CD4 count had recovered, she underwent laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, ileal resection, proctosigmoidectomy, colonic jejunal pouch to near-anal anastomosis with EEA, takedown splenic flexure, resection of ileostomy and creation of new end-ileostomy.
Pathology from the surgical specimen revealed no residual carcinoma and all 14 lymph nodes sampled were free of disease.
- [**9-/2141**], [**10/2141**]: Subsequent imaging of the abdomen & pelvis showed no evidence of recurrence.
- [**2142-2-14**]: CT abdomen showed "hyperdense thickening in the lumen near the anastomatic site, new since the earlier study.
Local recurrence cannot be excluded, although possibly the appearance is associated with endoluminal debris."
# Short gut syndrome secondary to bowel surgery for CA.
# Obstructive renal failure from radiation fibrosis, in the past  necessitating b/l nephrostomy tubes.
# Lower extremity neuropathy, likely secondary to radiation fibrosis, uses a wheelchair since 4/[**2141**].
# Pancreatic insufficiency.
# Chronic pain.
Her daughter has ulcerative colitis.

IMAGING: [**4-3**] LENIS: Limited examination, with wall-to-wall flow and augmentation seen in bilateral superficial/deep femoral and popliteal veins.
No CT evidence for cystitis; however, evaluation is limited both by underdistension of the bladder as well as significant likely radiation-related changes in the lower pelvis.
Unchanged appearance of small bowel loops with focal areas of thickened wall and folds likely related to radiation-related changes without bowel wall dilatation.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE This is a 49yo F PMHx HIV, rectal CA c/b bilateral nephrostomies & ileostomy, p/w vomitting, admitted to MICU for hypotension, found to have UTI, started on antibiotics w clinical improvement, stable and discharged home.
Hypotension / UTI: On admission, patient was found to have SBPs in the 70s with an intact mental status and without signs of ischemia / poor perfusion.
Patient was fluid resuscitated and started on levophed given concern for sepsis.
Patient was found to have a Klebsiella UTI based on cultures from [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**].
It was uncertain whether this represented a resolved viral gastroenteritis or ileus (as she has a history of ileus).
Acute renal failure: Creatinine was elevated to 3.8 on admission from baseline of 0.8.
Urine lytes were c/w prerenal state, and Cr trended down w fluid resuscitation.
No signs of obstruction on renal ultrasound.
Rectal cancer: No evidence of recurrence by CT [**11/2142**] or CEA [**2143-2-12**].
