Prior to admission, patient reports 2-3 days of vomiting and diarrhea and poor po intake.
She denies any associated fevers, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, lightheadedness or dysuria.
She notes a similar episode several months ago consisting of 1 week of vomiting and diarrhea that resolved w/o intervention, and had attributed the symptoms to the flu.
CT abdomen/pelvis reportedly revealed a dilated common bile duct, pancreatits and question of an ileus.
While in the ED, the patient did spike to 101.3 and had hypotension to 66/38.
She underwent RUQ U/S revealing a non-obstructive common bile duct stone without dilatation, gallbladder thickening or pericholecystic fluid.
Intermittent obstruction could not be excluded.
Given her history, she was taken for ERCP where she reportedly had several large stones extracted with good biliary drainage after extraction.
She does note an estimated 8lb weight loss over an estimated 5 months.
She notes a cough productive of bland sputum starting one week prior to presentation.
She denies any new lower extremity edema  Past Medical History: HTN Hypercholesterolemia  Social History: Lives alone.
Family History: No family history of GI malignancy or gallbladder disease.
Abd: Obese, mildly distended.
No tenderness, rebound or guarding.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration, although other forms of liver disease including more significant hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis, could result in a similar appearance.
Decreased caliber of the common bile duct since [**2198-8-25**], now non- distended at 4 mm, but with small shadowing stones seen within the distal duct.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis .
Bilateral pleural effusions, most prominent on the left with adjacent basilar atelectasis.
No suspicious consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.
Scattered not enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes are probably reactive.
Slightly prominent esophagus, could be due to inadequate distension or esophagitis, but difficult to assess without oral contrast.
KUB:[**8-26**] Findings are most consistent with an adynamic ileus with some increased distention of both small and large bowel with air.
This may indicate an abdominal wall hernia.
Some dilated loops of large and small bowel were noted.
No free air seen.
Left basilar atelectasis and/or fluid stable in appearance.
[**2198-8-25**]: ERCP Impression: Impacted stone in the major papilla Pre-cut sphincterotomy Stones at the common bile duct Mild Biliary dilation Stone extraction with balloon catheter  [**9-3**] ERCP: Impression: Evidence of a previous sphincterotomy was noted in the major papilla.
A single diverticulum with large opening was found on the rim of the major papilla.
There was a filling defect that appeared like sludge in the lower third of the common bile duct.
A 7cm by 10FR Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed successfully  Recommendations: Please call if develops jaundice, black stools, fever, or abdominal pain juices today when awake, alert, and at baseline follow for response/complications Consider cholecystectomy Repeat ERCP in 3 months for stent removal.
