On EKG he was shown to have 2-[**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevations in V2 and V3 with 1' AV block, no ST changes in I or AVL.
His Pt received clopidogrel, ASA, heparin, nitro gtt, integrilin; ST elevations returned to baseline.

Left ventricular hypertrophy.
ST segment depression and T wave inversions in leads I and aVL.
Biphasic to inverted T waves in leads V1-V3 consistent with acute anterolateral ischemic process.
Rule out myocardial infarction.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Selective angiography of this right dominant system revealed single vessel disease.
The LAD had a discrete 95% stenosis in the mid portion of the vessel, just after the first diagonal branch.
The LCx had minimal luminal irregularities, but angiographically-apparent disease.
Resting hemodynamic measurements revealed mildly elevated left sided filling pressures, with an LVEDP of 20 mm Hg.
There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve upon catheter pullback from the left ventricle into the ascending aorta.
No significant mitral regurgitation was visualized.
Single vessel coronary artery disease.
Reduced ventricular function.
[**2199-7-14**] EKG: Sinus bradycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2199-7-13**] the T waves are now biphasic in leads II, III and aVF and more prominently inverted in leads I and aVL.
There are more deeply inverted T waves with upward coved ST segments and slight ST segment elevations in leads V1-V3 and new ST-T wave changes in leads V4-V6 consistent with evolving anterolateral and apical myocardial infarction.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 50%).
There is hypokinesis of the distal anterior wall.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The LAD had a discrete 95% stenosis in the mid portion of the vessel.
An echocardiogram was performed and showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 50%), hypokinesis of the distal anterior wall, but the remaining walls contract well.
No aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation.
No mitral regurgitation.
No pericardial effusion.
