ACID FAST SMEAR (Final [**2163-5-20**]):       NO ACID FAST BACILLI SEEN ON DIRECT SMEAR.
ACID FAST CULTURE (Preliminary):  Imaging: [**5-18**] CXRay: IMPRESSION:  Nearly complete opacification of the left hemithorax with balanced mass effect, suggesting a large pleural effusion among other potential causes, including the possibility of malignancy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**5-19**] CXRay s/p chest tube: New left basal pigtail pleural drain has cleared virtually all the previous large left pleural effusion.
There is a small volume of pleural air at the apex and base of the left lung.
Moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged since [**5-19**] earlier in the day.
Pending pleural fluid cytology  Brief Hospital Course:  78 yo gentleman with pmhx s/f sacral decub and chronic obstructive uropathy transferred from OSH in shock (baseline pressures 120) with opacified left lung and found to be in hypercarbic respiratory failure with severely altered mentation necessitating intubation.
# Hypercarbic Respiratory failure: The patient was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and AMS nearing obtundation.
An ABG revealed hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis.
Over the course of the following 18 hours, patient demonstrated gradual decline in respiratory status and mental status (more somnulant).
It was initially felt that he was likely hypoventilating due to low tidal volumes from left lung due to collapse and inability to compensate with appropriate minute ventilation in right lung.
Records obtained from prior hospitalizations and nursing home clearly indicated that patient did not want intubation and mechanical ventilation.
The patient demonstrated continued clinical decline in respiratory efforts, and peacefully and quietly expired.
# Large left pleural effusion causing lung white out: Unclear etiology of pleural fluid, but it is exudative in nature and non-infectious.
Even after drainage and dramatic  radiographic improvement of left lung, the patient remained in hypercarbic respiratory failure.
# Shock:  No fever, no white count but pt did have predominant neutrophilia in setting of low blood pressures and floridly positive UA as well as living in nursing facility.
The patient's UA was positive for enterococcus and e coli.
Other than urine, potential sources included lung, which is unlikely in retrospect given the lack of consolidation on xray after pleural fluid tap and the non-infectious nature of the fluid itself, and stage IV sacral decubitus.
An echo revealed good EF, ruling out cardiogenic shock.
The patient was fluid resuscitated and placed on broad spectrum abx with zosyn, vanc, and levofloxacin to cover potential HCAP.
A cortistol level excluded adrenal insufficiency.
# Left leg>right leg swelling: US did not show DVT.
# Stage III-IV decub: Potential source of infection.
# Chronic obstructive uropathy: Pt requires chronic foley.
Likely contributing source for recurrent UTIs and was recently treated at OSH with levofloxacin for E coli UTI that was resistant to levofloxacin.
The patient was then made DNR/DNI and was not reintubated after self-extubation  Medications on Admission: Ferrous sulfate 325 mg by mouth twice a day OxyContin sustained release 10 mg by mouth twice a day vit B12 1000 mcg intramuscular once a month Lasix 20 mg by mouth daily Multivitamin 1 tablet by mouth daily Omeprazole 20 mg daily Vitamin C 500 mg daily Zinc sulfate 220 mg by mouth daily Lactobacillus 1 tablet by mouth twice a day Norvasc 10 mg daily Aspirin 81 mg daily Celexa 10 mg daily Folic acid 1 mg daily Oxycodone 5 mg by mouth every 4 hours when necessary pain tamulosin 0.4mg daily Neurontin 100 mg by mouth 3 times a day Zyprexa 2.5 mg daily at bedtime trazodone 25mg q6h PRN aggitation  Discharge Medications: N/A  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: n/a  Discharge Condition: n/a  Discharge Instructions: n/a  Followup Instructions: n/a                               [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2437**] MD [**MD Number(1) 2438**]  Completed by:[**2163-5-23**
