Per wife, pt woke her up on morning of admission stating that he had been having chest pain, had already taken 6 NTG tablets, but the pain was still present.
CXR showed pulmonary edema and he was given 40mg IV lasix.
ECG showed ST depressions in V4-V6 but old ECG read from [**5-1**] had called the same (actual ECG not able to be obtained).
Wife gave history that he had sustained several falls recently, the last being 2 days PTA when he had tripped over a wire.
She states he had been feeling well since then, eating well with no complaints.
Another ECG was checked and showed resolution of ST depressions in V4-6 and cardiology was called.
Neck: JVP to 6 cm, no bruit Lungs: Anteriorly diffusely rhonchorous Heart: RR S1S2 no mmru Abd: Flat, NT, ND, no bowel sounds heard Extremities: [**1-28**] + pitting edema greater on R, DP pulses not palpable.
Other Labs: [**2188-7-8**]: Iron 18; TIBC: 127; Vit b12: 704; Folat 10.8; Ferritin 286  ____________________________________ Imaging: EKG: at code NSR, ST depressions in I AVL, V2-V6, elevation in V1.
after code ST depressions appear to resolve, as does the elevation in V1 .
Continued moderate congestive heart failure.
Bibasilar opacities, which could represent asymmetric pulmonary edema, atelectasis, or possible aspiration.
[**2188-7-7**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the apex and hypokinesis of the disal half of the inferolateral wall.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is focal hypokinesis of the mid-apical free wall.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild 1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small-moderate circumferential pericardial effusion most prominent anterior to the right ventricle (1.3cm) without evidence for hemodynamic compromise.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant system with three vessel disease.
The LMCA was without flow limiting stenoses angiographically.
The LAD was diffusely diseased and had a 60% stenosis at D1.
D1 had an ostial 80% stenosis.
Limited resting hemodynamics showed mild pulmonary hypertension (PA mean 27 mmHg).
The right and left sided filling pressures were mildly elevated (LVEDP 17 mmHg, RVEDP 12 mmHg).
There was a peak-to-peak gradient of 7 mmHg across the aortic valve upon pull back of the catheter from the left ventricle into the aorta.
Mild left and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
The patient has a hiatus hernia with gastroesophageal reflux and therefore a gastrojejunostomy catheter was placed.
Brief Hospital Course: Briefly, this is a 85 year-old man with history significant for P.D., HTN who presented on [**7-6**] with chest pain.
Per CCU, patient was taken to the ED where CXR showed pulmonary edema.
ECG showed lateral ST depressions.
In the rads suite, found unresponsive and bradycardic.
No intervention was performed and pt was deemed a poor surgical candidate for CABG, so decision was to medically manage his CAD.
His arrest for felt secondary to hypoxia from CHF +/- aspiration pneumonia.
He has had several episodes of acute pulmonary edema since then that have responded to lasix, and several episodes of angina that respond to nitrates.
The following issues were addressed after transfer to floor:  1) RECENT CHEST PAIN.
Patient had eposides of chest pain.
All of these episodes were relieved with SL nitro and revealled no significant changes on EKG, or cardiac enzyme elevations.
2) CONGESITVE HEART FAILURE/EDEMA Initially, patient was diuresed gently with Lasix 100mg PO BID, and later Lasix 50 mg IV bid.
Patient with depressed EF on recent echo, and measurements consistent with diastolic dysfunction.
4) ANEMIA: Patient was guaiac negative, iron studies consistent with mixed iron deficiency/chronic anemia picture.
One episode of diarrhea ([**7-23**]) occurred, which is likely due to Tube feeds.
Senna 8.8 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: Five (5) ML PO BID prn as needed: prn constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1) Hypoxic respiratory failure 2) Congestive heart failure 3) Failed speech and swallow evaluation 4) Parkinson's Disease 5) Hypertension 6) Coronary Artery Disease 7) Pneumonia   Discharge Condition: stable, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: 1.
