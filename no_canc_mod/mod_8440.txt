HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 16 year old female with a history of cystic fibrosis status post bilateral lung transplants in [**2108-9-11**], who was admitted on [**2110-12-12**], following a rigid bronchoscopy with dilation and Mitomycin application to reduce swelling and scar tissue in the left main stem bronchus.
Shortly after application of Mitomycin, the patient developed a stridor and was treated with Albuterol and racemic epinephrine treatment before transfer to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit for observation.
While in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, the patient acutely desaturated with a pulse oximetry of 60%, was given a nebulizer treatment, non-rebreather mask and failed to improve with hypoxia in a range of pAO2 of 44.
Initially, this was thought to be an allergic reaction to Mitomycin and was treated with intravenous steroids, Benadryl and Pepcid.
With the concern of her possible PE causing shunt, the patient was intubated on the third day of hospital stay for a CT scan.
Cystic fibrosis status post bilateral lung transplant in [**2108-9-11**].
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Pancreatic insufficiency.
Seizures thought secondary to cyclosporin.
Sister also with cystic fibrosis.
In general, pleasant young female in no acute distress.
No oropharynx lesions.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rhonchi or crackles.
The patient had a CT scan of the chest which ruled out pulmonary embolism and showed diffuse air space and disease in the right lung and left lower lobe consistent with infection.
It showed parenchymal opacification around the left lower lobe consistent with bleeding.
There were multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum and hilum, consistent with post-infectious lymphadenopathy or with secondary post-transplantation lymphoma.
A small right pleural effusion.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 16 year old white female with a history of cystic fibrosis status post bilateral lung transplant now status post stent placement in the left mainstem bronchus with a right middle lobe and left lower lobe pneumonia, awaiting transfer back to the [**Hospital3 18242**].
It was unclear whether or not the patient was not appropriately hypoxic vasoconstricting versus if she had a pulmonary embolism.
A CT angiogram showed no evidence of a pulmonary embolism.
Pan cultures show the patient has a likely source of pulmonary given the findings on chest x-ray and follow-up CT scan.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient with a history of pancreatic insufficiency.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
No pathology was seen on examination.
It was determined that she likely has a refractory error and they recommended follow-up as an outpatient.
Findings were consistent with right ventricular strain.
Question whether this is acute versus chronic.
A CT scan showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
The patient also with status post new lung status post transplant, so it would be less likely that it is a permanent pulmonary process as usually right ventricular strain would improve with improved lungs.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient has been very hypophosphatemic and hypomagnesemic treated with p.o.
Once the patient gets a PICC line placed, we would recommend intravenous replacement.
NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient has history of seizures, questionable secondary to cyclosporin.
