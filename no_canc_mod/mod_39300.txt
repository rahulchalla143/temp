[**2118-8-24**]: BCX x 2: no growth to date  RADIOLOGY ========= [**2118-8-25**]: INDICATION:  36-year-old female with DKA and hematemesis, now requiring follow-up imaging for opacity on prior chest radiograph.
There are bilateral pleural effusions seen on the lateral but not on the frontal views.
There is no pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course: A 36 year old female with PMH Diabetes type I complicated by nephropathy and frequent presentation with DKA presents with DKA and hematemesis.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Type 1 DM Uncontrolled with Diabetic Ketoacitosis: Prior triggers have included menstrual cycle changes, she states that she has been taking her OCP regularly.
# Acute Blood Loss Anemia due to Hematemesis: With history of wretching hematemesis is likely related to [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear.
The differential includes peptic ulcer, gastritis (which she has had in the past).
# Diabetic Retinopathy: Patient is s/p vitrectomy [**8-15**].
She was seen by her outpatient ophthalmologist, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], while in-house for follow-up.
Drops were continued as per ophthalmology  CHRONIC ISSUES: # Anemia: Iron studies suggest iron deficiency anemia possibly on top of an anemia of chronic disease or CKD.
# Contraception: continued OCP while in hospital as this has been thought to contribute to DKA in the past.
Because of a longterm relationship with her nephrologist who is affiliated with [**Hospital3 **], she will continue with her PCP and nephrologist at [**Hospital3 **], in addition to [**Last Name (un) **] providers.
