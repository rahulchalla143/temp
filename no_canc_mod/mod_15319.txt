Admission Date:  [**2108-12-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2109-1-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2046-12-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**] Chief Complaint: Pleural effusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Tracheostomy  History of Present Illness: Pt is 61yo M with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recurrent pneumonia, tracheobronchial malacia, who is status post tracheoplasty in [**6-1**].
However, he continues to have recurrent pneumonias, believed secondary to aspiration.
At an outside hospital he developed respiratory failure.
He was intubated and his condition improved, though he developed a thrombocytopenia.
Past Medical History: COPD/Asthma CAD(remote MI >20 years ago) GERD DM- secondary to steroids Peripheral neuropathy tracheobronchomalacia(s/p tracheal & bilateral bronchial reconstruction)  Social History: Smoked 1ppd for 30 yrs quit 3 years agoDenies ETOH,drug use  Currently at rehab facility, lived alone before that.
CV: RRR Pulm: Coarse breath sounds throughout all lung fields.
SENSITIVITIES: MIC expressed in MCG/ML PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA CEFEPIME--------------     8 S CEFTAZIDIME-----------     8 S CIPROFLOXACIN---------   =>4 R GENTAMICIN------------     4 S IMIPENEM--------------  =>16 R MEROPENEM-------------     8 I PIPERACILLIN----------    16 S PIPERACILLIN/TAZO-----    16 S TOBRAMYCIN------------   <=1 S   Brief Hospital Course: Pt admitted [**2108-12-10**] to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2 for pleural effusion and shortness of breath from outside hospital.
Decided to wean pt off steroids for COPD as these were not felt to be helping him much.
A swallow eval at that time showed some aspiration of solid food, but with careful instruction he was able to tolerate oral intake witout aspiration.
Due to chronic inability to clear secretions, pt underwent placement of tracheostomy tube by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] on [**12-19**].
Since placement of the tracheostomy pt has had aggressive pulmonary toilet on the floor, including frequent suctioning, and his pulmonary status has continued to improve, with improving saturations on a gradually decreasing oxygen requirement.
A pH probe study showed significant lower esophageal reflux, with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] score of 47.
Esophageal manometry was of poor quality and with unclear diagnosis.
A nuclear medicine gastric emptying scan was positive for significant delay of gastric emptying, thus confirming that GERD likely has some role in his aspiration problems.
On [**12-24**], pt noted some abd discomfort with tube feeds, and his rate was lowered to 65cc/hr, which relieved the pain.
ID: Initially pt felt to be in sepsis arising from uncontrolled pneumonia.
On discharge pt is afebrile, and showing no signs of infection other than his chronic high-output respiratory secretions, which are not believed to be of infectious etiology.
