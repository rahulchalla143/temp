HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64 year old male transferred in from [**Hospital6 8283**], for pulmonary and infectious disease evaluation with a likely biopsy.
Initially he presented on [**2148-9-23**] with moderate dyspnea causing difficulty with daily activities.
In the Emergency Room there he was found to be in atrial fibrillation.
He was initially afebrile but chest x-ray showed some hilar adenopathy.
Follow up CTA was negative for a pulmonary embolism but later confirmed adenopathy.
The hospital course at [**Hospital3 4298**] was significant for a fever to 102 and new left lower lobe pneumonia by chest x- ray.
His PPD was negative but there was suspicion for lymphoma or leukemia with superimposed pulmonary infection.
On history the patient says his symptoms began approximately 24 hours prior to admission.
He had some palpitations but no cough.
Restless leg syndrome.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
8 hours, Mirapex unknown dose, Sinemet 25/100 two tablets every bedtime for his restless leg syndrome, question of Diltiazem 120 mg p.o.
The patient was worked up on the Medical and Cardiology Services for his dyspnea and hypoxia.
He also had atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response as well as workup for his lymphadenopathy.
Over the first couple of days he still complained of shortness of breath with any activity, as he continued to be worked up by the Cardiology Service for his recurrent atrial fibrillation.
He was also placed on a heparin drip for his atrial fibrillation.
The patient did have a history of some mitral regurgitation with his shortness of breath when he was in atrial fibrillation.
It was recommended that the patient have transesophageal echocardiography with possible cardioversion.
It was also determined to have the chest computerized tomography scan done.
Additional history obtained by the electrophysiology fellow showed that the patient did have a known history of mitral regurgitation and a question of Marfan's syndrome.
He had no follow up for the three years prior to admission, but went into atrial fibrillation approximately nine days before he was seen by the electrophysiology fellow.
He was usually in sinus rhythm but had three prior episodes of atrial fibrillation over 20 years with DC cardioversion times two.
The computerized tomography scan of the chest was negative for pulmonary embolus but positive for lymphadenopathy and positive for pleural effusion with scattered pulmonary nodularities.
The patient also on evaluation was being worked up for the possibility of encarditis for which the transesophageal echocardiography was ordered to do DC cardioversion for his atrial fibrillation and rule out the endocarditis at the same time.
He continued diuresis with intravenous Lasix.
His transesophageal echocardiography also showed a foiled mitral valve leaflet with 3 to 4 plus mitral regurgitation.
He had a normal left main with mild left anterior descending disease, 50 percent distal circumflex lesion and moderate proximal ectasia of the right coronary artery with several mitral regurgitation.
He had no carotid bruits.
His heart had a S1 and S2 tone with a Grade III/VI systolic ejection murmur, loudest at the apex with radiation to the left subclavian.
He appeared to not have any peripheral edema.
His chest x-ray from [**9-26**], showed bilateral effusions and evidence of congestive heart failure.
Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was also seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 58528**] from Cardiothoracic Surgery, fellow, in preparation for his surgery.
Consult was also obtained to evaluate his elevated INR which at that point his last dose of Coumadin had been six days prior with an INR of 2.3.
Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] also requested the FFP not be given due to the increased risk of congestive heart failure.
When the patient did complain of left foot upper quadrant pain on examination, the splenomegaly was palpated.
Computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed which showed bilateral small pleural effusions and multiple peripheral hypodensities in a spleen which was enlarged as well as some hypodensities in the right upper poles of the kidney.
He wounds had no signs of infection.
He did have 1 plus peripheral edema in his extremities.
His heart rate was 75 and in sinus rhythm with a respiratory rate of 18, blood pressure 114/55, sating 96 percent on room air.
His heart had no murmur, rub or gallop.
Status post mitral valve repair and Maze procedure.
Restless leg syndrome.
