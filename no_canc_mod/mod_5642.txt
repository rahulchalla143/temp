HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 69-year-old Caucasian female with known coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**2119**], ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF of 25%, severe mitral regurgitation and diabetes.
She was in her usual state of health until [**2124-10-13**] when she presented to an outside hospital not feeling well, found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation.
At that time she was started on Dopamine 3 mcg/minute and then Dobutamine was added secondary to hypotension.
Tele revealed an 11 beat and also a 23 beat run of non sustained V tach.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post CABG times five in [**2119**] with inferolateral deficit which were unreversible.
She also had a stress test in [**2124**] which showed fixed inferolateral deficits which were not reversible.
Severe/moderate MR, ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF of 25%, hypertension, diabetes mellitus with nephropathy and retinopathy, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral vascular disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Chest, coarse breath sounds bilaterally, no rales or wheezes.
Cardiac, regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no rubs, murmurs or gallops.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 23440**] underwent catheterization on [**2124-11-29**] which showed the following: Native three vessel disease with right sided dominance with LAD diffusely diseased, subtotal occlusion of the middle segment with competitive flow.
Left circumflex had diffuse disease with a 60% OM1 lesion.
On the right side RCA was diffusely diseased with 95% mid lesion, right side PDA with 70% lesions and competitive flow.
Overall there was diffuse hypokinesis with left ventricular ejection fraction of 22%.
Cath also revealed 2+ MR and 1+ AR which was less than previously thought.
She continued to have various beat runs of non sustained V tach which were self limited.
However, when cath revealed that MR was only mild disease, EPS study was completed without problems.
There was some question for possible aspiration pneumonia, and she was started on Levaquin and Flagyl.
ID:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 23440**] had UTI by urinalysis and culture showing greater than 100,000 colonies of Klebsiella.
