Admission Date:  [**2172-7-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-8-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-5-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**] Chief Complaint: unstable angina  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p coronary artery bypass grafting times three (LIMA to LAD, SVG to ramus/OM/PDA)   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **]  is a 70-year-old male with history of hypertension.
Four days prior to admission, he began having intermittent left-sided chest "twinging" without associated nausea, vomitting, or diaphoresis.
He denied an exertional, pleuritic, or positional component.
He presented to [**Hospital **], where an EKG showed NSR with a possible old anterior myocardial infarction.
He then underwent a stress echo showing reportedly ischemic EKG changes as well as septal hypokinesis.
Throughout his hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] and then at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**], patient continued to have continuous but fluctuating chest pain ranging [**12-15**] to [**4-14**] with description similar to above.
Nitro gtt was started at a low dose with minimal relief.
On acceptance to CCU service, Mr. [**Known lastname **] complained of ongoing 1/10 chest pain but felt otherwise well.
Shortly after arrival to the CCU the patient went to the cath lab for aortic baloon pump which was placed without complication.
While on the table he became chest pain free.
Review of systems notable for chest pain as above and chronic cough, unchanged recently.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Asthma COPD S/P inguinal hernia repair Cataract surgery 1.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Hypertension 2.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
Diffuse wheezes bilaterally.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
The LMCA had an eccentric 30% distal stenosis.
The LAD had a 60% stenosis proximally and 70% in the mid vessel.
The LCx had 70% proximal stenosis and 80% stenosis in the mid vessel.
The RCA was non dominant and had diffuse disease.
The LAD stenoses were interrogated using a Radi pressure wire.
In serial, the FFR was reduced to 0.74 after hyperemia induced by the administration of IC adenosine.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension with an SBP of 151 mmHg.
Moderate systemic hypertension.
ECHO [**2172-7-30**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Carotid US [**2172-7-30**]: Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA with no stenosis.

Now the patient demonstrates the presence of bypass surgery including sternotomy wires and multiple surgical clips in the left-sided anterior mediastinum consistent with the procedure.
There remain some linear basal densities on the bases and mild blunting of both lateral pleural sinuses, slightly more on the left than on the right.
This corresponds to minor blunting also of the posterior pleural sinuses seen on the lateral view.
Evidence of sizeable left lower lobe atelectasis that existed previous postoperative examinations has disappeared.
No new pulmonary abnormalities are present and no significant pulmonary ongestive pattern is identified.
Minor pleural blunting remains but no significant atelectasis or infiltrates are identified.
DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern5) 3250**] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 3251**] Approved: [**Doctor First Name **] [**2172-8-6**] 5:55 PM    Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension, presenting with unstable angina and a catheterization showing 3-vessel-disease including proximal LAD lesion.
Balloon pump was placed resulting in cessation of chest pain.
He had intermittant atrial fibrillation and was treated with lopressor, amiodarone and was started on coumadin.
He received solumedrol for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and Vancomycin for a presumed pneumonia by chest radiograph.
A sputum sample grew methicillin resistant staph, but the infectious disease service felt that the sample was contaminated.
INR goal for atrial fibrillation is [**1-14**].
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
