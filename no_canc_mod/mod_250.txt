Cyclophosphamide was considered, but not started given concern for toxicity due to age.
She appeared volume overloaded on exam and CXR.
She was given Lasix 40mg IV x2 with minimal urine output.
Nebulizers were tried with minimal relief.
Additionally, given rapid progression of hypoxia, renal suspected etiology other than volume overload alone.
Given progressive hypoxia and increased work of breathing, patient is transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
On [**2138-9-10**], patient developed LGIB in context of constipation and straining for bowel movement.
She complained of shortness of breath, fatigue.

[**2138-8-26**] Renal US - No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Normal-appearing kidneys.
[**2138-9-1**] Renal biopsy: Pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis in the setting of ANCA positivity.
[**2138-8-30**] RLE ultrasound: No right lower extremity DVT.
[**2138-9-1**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**8-25**], there has been substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral pleural effusions.
[**2138-9-12**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Worsening hydrostatic pulmonary edema.
[**2138-9-12**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Improved pulmonary edema which is now moderate, stable bibasilar pleural effusions with satisfactory position of the ET tube and right central venous line.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]yo female with history of hypertension was admitted with acute renal failure, coagulopathy, and microscopic hematuria of unclear etiology.
Acute renal failure Initially, the etiology of her acute renal failure was unclear.
Renal biopsy was pursued and demonstrated crescentic glomerulonephritis in the setting of ANCA positivity.
Etiology of her renal failure was found to be hydralazine-related pauci-immune glomerulonephritis.
Shortly after admission, she was started on hemodialysis and did not demonstrate any signs of renal recovery.
Her INR was slightly elevated to 1.3 on admission and had minimal improvement with Vitamin K administration.
PTT remained markedly elevated.
Anemia: Patient was found to have anemia related most likely to anemia of chronic disease and chronic kidney disease.
Patient was initially continued on her home regimen for hypertension with the exception of her [**Last Name (un) **] which was held due to renal failure.
Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage During this admission, she developed an oxygen requirement and hemoptysis, concerning for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
GI Bleding Patient had an episode of GI bleeding during this admission thought likely related to hemorrhoids, diverticuli, or ischemia in the setting of vasculitis.
