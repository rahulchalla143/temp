Extinction and Neglect: unable to assess  History of the Present Illness: This is a 51yo M with a history of multiple medical problems notable for bilateral orichiectomy for left testicular seminoma, EtOH and tobacco abuse, HOCM s/p septal ablation x 2, s/p AICD placement, L5-S1 disc herniation and spontaneous pneumothorax s/p partial lung resection who was in his USOH this evening until about 1AM on [**2177-2-24**].
His wife did report that his back pain was particularly excruciating this evening, and so he went to lay down on his bed.
His wife noticed that his speech was slurred and that he had a right facial droop.
Seconds later, he started to display repetitive grunting sounds and fast breathing.
He was unresponsive and his whole body started to tonically contract and vibrate.
There were no clonic movements or jerking noted.
He continued to have a right facial droop, and complained "there is something wrong with the right side of my face".
- In [**2171**], he presented with left hemiparesis and hemihypesthesia following a "possible seizure".
Only a routine EEG was done and this showed no interictal epileptiform discharges.
- In [**2173**], he was evaluated as a code stroke for a chief complaint of gait instability.
He had a functional examination with nonphysiologic visual loss and was discharged from the ED.
- In early [**2174**], he presented with complaints of dysarthria and right hemiparesis and hemisensory loss and possible field cut.
His symptoms at that time did not fit a typical vascular distribution, and was thus discharged from ED - In [**2175**], he presented with right facial pain radiating to his head, followed by minutes of paresthesias, followed by minutes of numbness progressing to lasting weakness of right arm/leg with no facial involvement.
He had no actual discernable weakness, but did have a positive [**Doctor Last Name 60437**] sign and could be made to give full strength if position was changed.

Radiology: ED STROKE CTA HEAD & NECK WITH PERFUSION	Study Date of [**2177-2-24**] 1:44 AM FINDINGS:  CT HEAD: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, infarction, edema, or mass effect seen.
There is no hydrocephalus or midline shift.
No fracture is identified.
CT PERFUSION STUDY: The cerebral blood volume, blood flow, and mean transit time maps appear unremarkable with no mismatch to suggest acute ischemia.
There is a common origin of the right and left carotid arteries.
Bilateral common carotid arteries and vertebral arteries in the neck are otherwise patent with no evidence of stenosis, occlusion, dissection, or pseudoaneurysm formation.
Bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries, vertebral arteries, and basilar artery and their major branches appear normal with no evidence of stenosis, occlusion, dissection, or aneurysm formation.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
CXR [**2177-2-24**]: FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION: No focal opacity to suggest pneumonia is seen.
No supine evidence of pneumothorax or significant pleural effusion is identified.
An esophageal catheter is in place with tip within the stomach and side port at or just beyond the expected location of the gastroesophageal junction.
CXR [**2177-2-24**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increasing retrocardiac density, likely to be caused by atelectasis.
Neurophysiology: EEG	Study Date of [**2177-2-24**] IMPRESSION: This is a mildly abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of absence of a posterior dominant rhythm in the first few hours of recording and mixed fast activity consistent with mild encephalopathy likely related to sedative medications.
However, in the second half of the recording, the background improves with appearance of posterior dominant alpha rhythm at 9 Hz and normal sleep architecture.
No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures are present in this study.
There were no pushbutton activations.
No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures were recorded.
Inferior wall myocardial infarction, age indeterminate.
Right bundle-branch block.
ECG	Study Date of [**2177-2-24**]  1:38:02 AM  Probable sinus rhythm with extensive artifact.
Right bundle-branch block.
Probable inferior wall myocardial infarction, age indeterminate, although lead II is difficult to visualize.
No previous tracing available for comparison.

Intervals	Axes Rate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	P	QRS	T 94	160	136	380/439	59	-85	52  Brief Hospital Course: 51 yo man with a history of multiple medical problems including bilateral orchiectomy for L testicular seminoma, longstanding EtOH and tobacco abuse, HOCM s/p septal ablation x2, s/p AICD placement and subsequent replacement, L5-S1 disc herniation and spontaneous pneumothorax s/p partial lung resection and in addition multiple neurological symptoms felt to be functional in origin who presented with slurred speech and right facial droop found to have had seemingly 5-6x GTC "seizures" with reasonably retained consciousness in between and was intubated for airway protection in the ED and transferred to the ICU.
His course was complicated by low BP's likely secondary to phenytoin/propofol/lorazepam/fentanyl/midazolam received, so he was started on levo in the ED and this was not continued in the ICU.
He was monitored on EEG LTM which was unremarkable with no epileptiform discharges for >36hrs.
These possible seizures may have been related to the patient tapering his alcohol use although given his long history of functional presentations and functional examination post extubation raises the possibility of non-epileptic events.
He has a long history of numerous presentations with pseudoneurologic symptoms where he was found to have functional examinations.
Patient was admitted due to right sided weakness with right facial droop and dysarthria and this was followed by a possible seizure at home.
In total he had [**5-18**] possible GTC seizures where per review in the ED.
Given several possible seizures during assessment by neurology, including the last in the CT scanner he was therefore intubated in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
There seemed to be retained consciousness in between seizures but was somewhat confused.
Code stroke protocol CT was normal save some possible hyperemia in the L hemisphere on CTP which was latterly read as normal.
CTA revealed an aberrant right subclavian artery and was otherwise normal.
He was switched to fentanyl/midazolam sedation and given hypotension and posible seizures was treated with broad spectrum IV antibiotics in the ED in addition to brief treatment with levo which was stopped on arrival to the ICU.
He was started on keppra given possible seizures and was placed on LTM to evaluate for possible seizure activity.
EEG initially showed encephalopathy while the patient was intubated and sedated, but once sedation was weaned, there was no noted seizure activity from [**Date range (1) 21759**]/[**2177**].
He was rapidly able to be extubated on [**2177-2-24**] and post-exubation examination revealed a functional right hemiparesis with right hemisensory disturbance and mental state examination as intact.
Patient's weakness improved but continued to have a functional examination.
# Cardiovascular: Given transient hypotension in the ICU, his home hypertensives were initially held but restarted on discharge.
He had no events on cardiac telemetry.
# Pulmonary: CXR was stable, and pt did well from a respiratory standpoint once extubated.
He was initially started on vanc/zozyn in the ED given concern for an infectious process given hypotension and new onset seizures.
Once patient was extubated and more easily able to be assessed he displayed no signs or symptoms of infection the antibiotics were stopped.
WCC was stable and patient remained afebrile throughout.
# Hematology: Patient was noted to have a macrocytosis with MCV 100 which was likely related to alcohol abuse/B12/folate deficiency.
Medications on Admission: - Toprol XL: 100mg - Verapamil 120mg [**Hospital1 **] - ASA 325mg daily - Lidocaine patch daily - Hydrocodone APAP 5/500 [**Hospital1 **] PRN   Discharge Medications: 1. hydrocodone-acetaminophen 5-500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for back pain.
8. propranolol 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for tachycardia.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital **] Home Health Services  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Possible alcohol withdrawal seizures.
No abnormalities on EEG or imaging.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent with right functional weakness.
On limb exam there is significant functional weakness with normal tone throughout although intermittent effort on the right and despite being seemingly unable to move the right arm much was noted to be able to talk on the phone or hodl a [**Location (un) 6002**] normally on the right.
There is no reflex asymmetry and plantars flexor bilaterally.
He does have bilateral UE tremor.
You presented with right-sided weakness and several seizure-like episodes in the setting of chronic alcohol use although you had been decreasing your alcohol intake recently.
You had a CT scan which was unremarkable and this included imaging of the blood vessels.
This revealed no predisposition for seizures or evidence of continued seizure activity and given this reassuring finding we therefore stopped the keppra.
There was no worrying cause found for your right sided weakness which should completely improve.
