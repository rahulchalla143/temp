While in the SICU the patient has had intermittent episodes of hypotension supported by fluids, blood, and neosynephrine ([**Date range (1) 35685**]), felt to be d/t blood loss vs. sepsis.
She grew Serratia and Enterobacter in sputum and blood cultures from [**12-11**].
Subsequent OSH records were available showing MSSA in wound (?
Was doing fairly well until the patient developed sustained VT times 2 last night, the first of which she spontaneously converted out of and the second of which required shock, intubation, and pressors.
Since then the patient has remained hypotensive with SBP 70-90's and bradycardic with HR in 50's.

The tip of an enterostomy or gastrostomy tube projects over the left paramedian abdomen and appears to cannulate either a loop of bowel or a length of tubing, which is directed superiorly projecting over a collection of air above the diaphragm presumably in the thoracic portion of a gastric hiatus hernia.
Moderately severe pulmonary edema has improved slightly since [**1-6**] accompanied by persistent small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusion and mild cardiomegaly.
There is no pneumothorax.
Injection of contrast material showed no leak.
There is a discrepancy in gastric wall thickness covering the gastrostomy tube retainer compared to the thickness of the gastric wall elsewhere.
Large bilateral pleural effusions.
Patchy areas of ground-glass opacity in aerated portions of both lungs with superimposed more confluent areas of opacity.
Findings could be due to asymmetrical pulmonary edema or superimposed infection.
Bone destruction and fluid collection in right acetabulum/proximal right femur consistent with known hardware infection.
Post-traumatic changes in the right shoulder.
The internal carotid arteries as well as the basilar artery appear patent.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is hard to assess given the limited views but susptect it is mildly decreasedl (LVEF 45-55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular systolic function is hard t oassess given the limited views but suspect normal function.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2) Mild to moderate ([**2-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
6.There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**8-/2404**]) immediately if          sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this patient's isolate.

# Respiratory Failure: The pt was initially intubated on [**12-8**] s/p OR due to hypoxia and respiratory failure.
She remained reintubated, and the reason for her failure to wean was felt to be multifactorial.
She also had pulmonary edema and large bilateral pleural effusions felt to be CHF-related.
In addition, the pt was deemed to have ICU myopathy based on NIF of -5.
At times during diuresis with Lasix, she became hypotensive with SBP in 70s, requiring levophed to help with further diuresis.
She continued to require ventilator support due to pleural effusions and muscular weakness (ICU myopathy).
# ID: The pt was hypotensive on transfer, felt to be due to sepsis in the setting of fever, WBC of 20, and enterobacter and serratia in her blood culutres from [**12-11**].
On [**1-2**], the pt spiked a temp and again had an increased WBC and was restarted on Vanc/Meropenem for presumed VAP and possible sepsis (had increased resp.
Her metoprolol had been stopped due to hypotension.
#Weakness: The pt was deemed to have ICU myopathy by the neurology service.
Her weakness seems to be more proximal in nature, hence explaining the initial concern for "man in [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]" syndrome.
Initial radiology reads were concerning for PEG placement.
Surgery felt the PEG was in proper position without complication (after CT of the abdomen was performed), so tube feeds were initiated in the pt without difficulty.
