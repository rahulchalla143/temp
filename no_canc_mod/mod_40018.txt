He had been feeling fatigued/lethargic as per his wife but with was in his usual state of cardiac health (able to walk [**1-27**]-mile without chest pain or shortness of breath; no orthopnea, no PND, no peripheral edema) until sunday evening around 3AM when he awoke with dyspnea and substernal chest pressure that felt like an "[**Location (un) 2452**] stuck in his chest."
He thinks the pain may have radiated to the shoulder, he did have diaphoresis (which he attributed to symptomatic hypoglycemia), shortness of breath, and feeling "off balance."
En-route to the hospital he was given 1 spray of sL nitroglycerine which relieved his chest pain permenantly.
At NWH his EKG revealed lateral ST depressions and his CK was positive at 660, Trop 8.8.
CXR showed mild CHF and later he was placed on 100%NRB for hypoxia and given 40mg IV lasix without response.
Also significant to his history is an axillary temperature of 100.2 at the OSH with several days of feeling fatigued, lethargic, with poor appetite.
He denies any abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He does report recent T to 100.2 axillary but denies chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
He denies abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting although he did notice abdominal pain when his PCP pressed on his RUQ and again when this maneuver was done here.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall  left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %) with  global hypokinesis and regional akinesis of the inferior and infero-lateral  walls.
There is moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at  the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic  stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve  leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is  seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild  pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared to the prior study (images reviewed) dated [**2111-1-27**], the overall LVEF has decreased and the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and timi 3 flow (see ptca comments).
Brief Hospital Course: 70 yo M with severe CAD s/p CABG in [**2097**] and stents to LCX and L-PDA in [**1-/2111**], presenting with NSTEMI s/p balloon angioplasty of LCX for in stent stenosis.
Also with RUQ pain and distended gall bladder on U/S consistent with acalculous cholecystitis s/p percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement.
#NSTEMI Patient presented w/ ekg changes concerning for laternal infarct, CK peak of 614, Troponins-T peak 2.09, in setting of severe CAD history.
Cardiac cath revealed in-stent stenosis of LCX treated with balloon angioplasty.
No new stents were placed given fever, RUQ pain and concern for sepsis.
Transfused 3 units PRBC for low HCT, with stable HCT since.
Chest pain resolved s/p angioplasty.
Initially was hypoxemic and hypervolemic, however resolved this CHF exacerbation, which was likey precipitated by ischaemia, w/ lasix and afterload reduction w/ hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate.
# Abdominal pain Initial RUQ pain and dilated gallbladder on ultrasound were consistent with acute acalculous cholecystitis; given pt was poor operative candidate [**Hospital1 **] recommended IR guided percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement.
Initial wbc, fever, and abdominal pain resolved w/ perc chole tube and Zosyn x 7 days.
# Hypoxia During initial 2 days of hospitalization patient was hypoxic and requiring oxygenation with 50% face mask.
He was at first though to have CHF and a superimposed LLL pneumonia.
Patient has no known history of lung disease, however exam was positive for wheezing which responded to albuterol and atrovent nebulization.
# Diabetes Patient's DM is complicated by nephropathy and neuropathy.
