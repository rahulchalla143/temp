he was initially admitted on [**5-18**] to [**Hospital **] hospital for the pacer placement after he was found to have tachy-brady syndrome.
He presented to [**Hospital **] hospital and was admitted to the cardiovascular ICU with a low grade temp.
This morning he was noted to be increasing lethargic and a Head CT was obtained which showed a 2 cm left acute on chronic subdural hematoma with 1.5 cm of midline shift to the right.
He was given 2 units of FFP and 10mg of Vitamin K at [**Hospital **] hospital and was emergently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

[**2133-5-24**] CT Head: Interval craniotomy with partial left subdural hematoma evacuation.
Moderate amount of right frontal pneumocephalus which causes slight sulcal and gyral effacement.
