Congenital hepatic fibrosis with nodule formation and extensive fibrosis.
No steatosis seen.
Iron stain shows no stainable iron.
[**2101-11-29**]  	Radiology	DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates no focal or textural abnormality.
There is no biliary dilatation.
The gallbladder appears unremarkable, without stone, wall thickening, or pericholecystic fluid.
A moderate abdominal ascites is present.
Umbilical vein recanalization, splenomegaly, and ascites, consistent with portal hypertension.
No gallbladder abnormality.
[**2101-11-30**]  	Radiology	CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Bilateral lungs are adequately expanded and there is no opacity concerning for pneumonia or aspiration.
There is no pleural effusion.
FINDINGS: Small bilateral pleural effusions with minimal adjacent atelectasis are present.
Numerous low-attenuation lesions are present in bilateral kidneys, however, in the upper pole of the left kidney is a 2.3 x 1.1 cm lesion with internal high attenuation septa.
The liver has a nodular contour and the right lobe of the liver is small, but the caudate is hypertrophied.
No discrete liver lesions are identified.
A small-to-moderate amount of ascites is present.
No free air is present.
No significant adenopathy is present in the abdomen.
A possible encapsulated lipoma measuring 2.3 x 1.1 cm is present adjacent to the pancreatic tail (4:29).
Stomach and abdominal loops of bowel appear normal; however, there are likely esophageal and gastric varices.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious bone lesions are identified.
Cirrhotic liver with evidence for portal hypotension with recanalization of paraumbilical vein and splenomegaly.
No liver lesions identified, however.
Left upper pole renal lesion which appears to have thick septations and an MRI of the kidney should be performed to better evaluate and exclude malignancy.
ADDENDUM: The Bosniak classification for the earlier described left upper pole lesion with thick septations would be a Bosniak classification III.
Brief Hospital Course: 31 yo previously healthy male transferred from OSH after acute large volume hematemesis, then found to have portal hypertension of unclear etiology and severe esophageal and gastric varices, stable after banding.
# UGIB: hemodynamically stable, but has received a total of 7 units pRBC.
Likely from severe esophageal and gastric varices as seen on OSH EGD.
[**Name2 (NI) **] differential of cirrhosis included alcoholic, Wilson's, hep b/c, autoimmune and non-cirrhotic causes Schisto, multiple prior infections, congenital.
Hep C sAb negative.
Final pathology showed congenital hepatic fibrosis.
Given congenital hepatic fibrosis, suspect renal lesions may be due to polycystic kidney disease (see below).
# Multiple renal lesions: Pt has "numerous" bilateral renal lesions seen on CT, including one lesion on L upper pole concerning for possible malignancy, Bosniak criteria 3.
Given congenital hepatic fibrosis seen on biopsy, suspect polycystic kidney disease.
Nephrology was consulted and agreed with potential diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease.
#Fever: Patient had no evidence of infection at the OSH.
He did not have any leukocytosis.
Pt was started on ceftriaxone 1g iv daily for SBP prophylaxis in the setting of acute GI bleed.
Pt has been afebrile since.
Blood cx showed no growth.
UA 55 RBCs, 9 WBCs, no bacteria (w/ foley).
CXR showed no evidence to suggest pneumonia or aspiration.
Pt remained afebrile for the rest of his course.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Pt will need close GI/Liver follow-up given his severe portal hypertension and potential for bleeds.
-Pt will need renal follow-up for polycystic kidney disease including outpatient MRI to rule out malignancy in L upper pole mass.
-If Pt has polycystic kidney disease, Pt may need additional testing such as MRA head to look for aneurysms, and genetic counseling.
No herbals, no supplements.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*1*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: congenital hepatic fibrosis portal hypertension variceal bleed ?
polycystic kidney disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 91022**],  You initially went to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital after having a sudden episode of large volume bloody vomiting.
You had an emergent upper endoscopy during which you were found to have many varices (dilated blood vessels) in your esophagus and stomach, and very high pressure in the blood vessels of your abdomen (the portal system).
You had a second bleed, and you were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
You had a liver biopsy here, which showed that you have a condition called congenital hepatic fibrosis.
You will need to avoid contact sports and be very careful during other activites to avoid rupturing your spleen, which may cause severe internal bleeding.
These will help eliminate excess fluid from your body.
Your liver condition is also associated with a kidney disease call Polycystic Kidney Disease.
On CT imaging of your abdomen, we found that you have many cyst-like lesions on both of your kidneys.
You were seen by our kidney specialists (nephrologists), who feel that you likely have a variant called Autosomal Dominal Polycystic Kidney Disease.
***** Patients with polycystic kidney disease often also develop bloody urine, repeated urinary tract infections.
