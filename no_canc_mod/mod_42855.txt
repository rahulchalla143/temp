Admission Date:  [**2157-4-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2157-5-12**]  Date of Birth:   [**2110-9-29**]       Sex:  F  Service:  GENERAL SURGERY BLUE TEAM  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46-year-old African-American woman that presented on [**4-26**] to the Emergency Department complaining of abdominal pain, vomiting and chills.
Through that time, she required transfusion as her hematocrit was dropping with no clear evidence of a bleeding source.
A pulsatile arterial bleeder that appeared to be a branch of the common femoral artery was found and was oversewn with Prolene suture.
At the time of her discharge, she was afebrile and did not have any abdominal pain.
However, the next morning at around 1 a.m., the patient then developed acute onset of sharp abdominal pain that localized in the periumbilical region with no radiation.
Dilated cardiomyopathy 3.
Mitral regurgitation 4.
Aortic insufficiency 5.
End stage renal disease status post cadaveric renal transplant in [**2151**] 6.
Hypothyroidism 7.
Peripheral vascular disease 8.
Distant history of bipolar disease  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: (As previously mentioned) 1.
Multiple AV fistula placements 3.
There is decreased bowel sounds, positive rebound, positive shake tenderness.
IMAGING:  CT scan showed a large 8 x 7 cm intraabdominal abscess with free air, thus the patient immediately went to the Operating Room for an ischemic colon.
The patient underwent a total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy.
The findings included an ischemic perforated transverse colon.
She also suffered a small myocardial infarction postoperatively and cardiology was thus involved in her care.
The source was initially unclear, although her left thigh incision appeared to be erythematous.
Two small areas were opened up and the patient was sent to ultrasound for drainage of fluid collection around the staple line.
This fluid grew out Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, thus the patient was started on vancomycin.
The patient continued to spike fevers despite being put on vancomycin and she was re-cultured in several areas.
On [**5-5**], her [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] culture that was collected grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa and infectious disease was consulted.
The aztreonam and imipenem is for double coverage of Pseudomonas and the fluconazole is empiric therapy.
