Yesterday he felt generalized weakness and slipped out of his bed while trying to get out.
No truama and landed on his buttocks.
He experienced transient chest pain two days ago but unable to give any more details about it.

No blood in stool.
Past Medical History: - Stage IV CKD - Atrial fibrillation - h/o GI bleed, diverticulitis - C. Diff colitis - h/o stroke 12 years ago w/ right-sided weakness; second stroke 5 years ago - h/o nephrolithiasis w/ stent and nephrostomy tube - CAD s/p MI - sleep apnea not on cpap - h/o klebsiella urosepsis, MRSA line infection - depression - PFTs [**2117**] with mild restrictive ventilatory defect -Anemia with h/o iron deficiency .
Social History: Lives with wife [**Name (NI) **], daughter lives downstairs, h/o smoking [**12-20**] PPD for 50 years, quit 20 years ago, occsional beer, none recently, no drugs.
Pertinent Results: EKG: afib with vent rate in 90s, LAD, PVC, no acute ST-T changes compared to [**2125-10-22**].
CXR [**2125-12-1**]: Low lung volumes, with no acute abnormalities.
Enlarged gallbladder with a trace amount of pericholecystic fluid.
There is no cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis.
Overall, these findings are equivocal for acute cholecystitis and in the right clinical setting, correlation with ultrasound is recommended.
Chronic dissection and aneurysmal dilation of the left common and external iliac arteries.
No evidence of cholecystitis.
[**2125-12-10**] Tunnelled Line Placement: Successful placement of a 15.5 French tunneled dialysis catheter  with 23-cm tip-to-cuff length via left internal jugular vein with the tip positioned in the right atrium.
Findings consistent with acute right IJ thrombosis.
[**2125-12-7**] Bilateral LE U/S: Findings consistent with chronic left SFV thrombus.
Nonocclusive  echogenic material within the right distal SFV, a son[**Name (NI) 493**] appearance more consistent with old thrombus, but age indeterminate.
[**2125-12-3**] RUQ U/S: Distended gallbladder with sludge, and minimal wall thickening.
No definite evidence of acute cholecystitis.

1)Multi-drug resistent Ecoli sepsis:  He was initially admitted to the MICU as he was hypotensive with SBP 70's which improved with IVF.
Etiology of recurrant ecoli sepsis unclear, however it appears to be the same bacteria given that resistance profile is the same.
He had ultrasound to evaluate for possible infected thrombus.
He was found to have a right IJ thrombus.
Anticoagulation was considered and briefly started however given his significant h/o diverticular bleeding causing discontinuation of anticoagulation in the past it was stopped.
2)Acute on Chronic heart failure - per recent echocardiogram report appears consistent with cor pulmonale (?
[**1-20**] long untreated OSA), likely with current mild decompensation given pulmonary congestion and left sided effusion new since admission, likely [**1-20**] volume resuscitation.
He has plans for AV fistula by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 816**] however concern is to determine source of recurrant bacteremia before placing AV fistula.
5) h/o CAD/PVD/CVA: no acute issues, he was continued on ASA 325   6) h/o Afib/flut: Currently in afib but rate controlled.
He is not on anticoagulation at baseline due to history of significant diverticular bleeding.
7) H/O Diverticulosis - no acute issues.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Nursing Home - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Ecoli Bactermia ESRD on Hemodialysis h/o Diverticulosis RIJ thrombosis   Discharge Condition: stable, alert and oriented x3, no distress   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you were feeling light headed and weak.
You were found to have bacteria in your blood stream.
You had evaluation of your gallbladder which didn't show any problem or cause for infection.
This may be the source of bacteria so your right side dialysis line was removed to help the blood clot dissolve.
Medications: 1) You were started on an antibiotic to treat the blood stream infection.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you experience any worrisome symptoms including light headedness, weakness, fevers, low blood pressure or other worrisome symptoms.
Dr.[**Name (NI) 12913**] office should contact you with an appointment.
