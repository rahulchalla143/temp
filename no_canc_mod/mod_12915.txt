Hemorrhagic stroke.
Congestive heart failure.
Renal failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81 year-old male with no significant past medical history who presented to the Emergency Room after experiencing right sided weakness after a fall on the day of admission.
The patient provides a vague history, however, describes the event as follows, the patient experienced left sided shoulder pain for approximately one week in the subsequent developing swelling and a mass over his left sternoclavicular joint.
On the day of admission the patient reported continued right sided lower extremity pain/numbness, which caused a fall.
In the Emergency Room he was noted to have a right facial droop.
In the Emergency Room the patient was pan cultured and started empirically on Vancomycin, Gentamycin for endocarditis and sent for a CT to evaluate the patient's chest mass and a CT to evaluate the patient's neurological deficits.
Left sided shoulder bursitis.
No history of valve replacement.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No carotid bruits.
2 out of 3 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal base.
A 4 cm by 5 cm firm lesion over the left sternoclavicular joint.
Extremities no cyanosis or edema.
No ST changes.
No T wave inversions.
Intraventricular conduction delay.
Chest x-ray showed no congestive heart failure, infiltrate or obvious emboli.
CT of the head showed two intraparenchymal fossae of hemorrhage seen at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter junction one most posteriorly along the phallic at the widex and the other within the left mid parietal lobe.
These findings likely consistent with the patient's known history of septic emboli.
CT of the chest revealed joint effusion with enhancing margins and suggestion of tiny focus of air within at the left sternoclavicular joint.
This likely represents an abscess, incidental node in the lymph nodes in the prevascular space some of which are borderline enlarged.
LVEF of greater then 55%, no mass or vegetations are seen in the aortic valve, at least trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears mildly thickened, mild 1+ mitral regurgitation is seen.
No pericardial effusion.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal, over left ventricular systolic function appears mildly depressed with probable distal septal hypokinesis, right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened, moderate 2+ aortic regurgitation was seen.
No abscess seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened, moderate 2+ mitral regurgitation is seen, moderate pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with trivial pericardial effusions.
There is a mobile echo dense mass seen on the ventricular side of the anterior mitral leaflet, which may represent a vegetation versus ruptured corti.
Chest x-ray from [**2-22**] mild upper zone redistribution with no pulmonary edema.
Chest x-ray from [**2-23**] consistent with slight left heart failure.
Chest x-ray from [**2-24**] showed worsening left heart failure with early pulmonary edema.
Chest x-ray from [**2-26**] shows OG tip below the left hemidiaphragm and increasing congestive heart failure.
Chest x-ray from [**2-27**] shows persistent left basilar opacity and worsened right lower lung lobe zone patchy opacity indicating worsening infiltrates with developing pneumonia to be considered.
Head CT on [**2-24**] possible slight progression of left posterior frontal hemorrhage is noted.
A question of a new high right cerebral vertex subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There were new areas of hypodensity within the left occipital lobe corresponding to a left PCA distribution.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Neurological:  The patient initially evaluated by head CT, which showed areas of hemorrhagic stroke initially thought likely due to septic emboli.
Ceftriaxone was later added in his hospitalization on [**2-27**] when a chest x-ray showed possible development of a pneumonia.
The patient's symptoms were thought likely due to septic emboli.
Cardiovascular:  The patient presented with likely sequela from septic emboli.
