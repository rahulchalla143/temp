Brief Hospital Course: 85 yo F with CHF, T2DM, COPD, and dementia admitted with altered mental status found to have profound hypercarbia and worsened cardiac function on echo.
The patient was maintained on BiPAP to improve her hypercarbia, and her mental status improved.
# Acute on chronic respiratory failure.
Likely etiology is intercurrent MI or ischemic insult to the heart resulting in worsened CHF as evidenced by TTE with progression of cardiac dysfunction.
# Altered mental status.
Likely secondary to hypercardia/respiratory acidosis.
# Congestive heart failure.
Progressive failure on echo with clinical signs of fluid overloaded.
- Diurese.
To consider starting low dose ACEi as tolerated if CRI stable.
# Elevated LFTs.
Likely secondary to congestion in the setting of worsening CHF.
# Hypernatremia.
