Decannulated [**11-25**]   History of Present Illness: This is a 57 year old male recently admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 2829**] service with gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP/papillotomy/stent on [**9-25**] complicated by pancreatic necrosis & pseudocyst replacement presents with infected pancreatic necrosis/pseudocyst.
He has had absolutely no change since discharge in his level of abdominal pain, degree of nausea or presence of fevers, chills, rigors or steatorrhea.
His sole concern leading to a visit to his PCP was progressive hyperglycemia since discharge, requiring escalating doses of insulin.
On [**10-11**] his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 15598**]'t "like the way (he) looked", so he sent him to [**Hospital3 3765**] where he has found to have a leukocytosis with 54% band neutrophils.
Subsequent abdominal CT demonstrated slightly larger area of pancreatic necrosis and cyst, but with diffuse gas throught the collection.
He was hemodynamically normal transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management.

Diffuse haziness is seen over both lung fields consistent with layering pleural effusion tracking posteriorly.
Increased retrocardiac density is seen on the left side consistent with airspace disease/atelectasis of the left base.
IMPRESSION:  Findings are consistent with pleural effusions layering posteriorly, more marked on the left side than on the right and apparently increasing since the prior examination.

Brief Hospital Course: This is a 57 year old male with copious amounts of extraluminal gas in his pancreatic pseudocyst.
The source of the air is likely the bowel gas transmitted across the biliary stent placed in ERCP ten days ago and may not be from gas-forming bacteria presently.
He went to the OR for pancreatic necrosectomy on [**10-11**] (1 liter of purulent fluid), cholecystostomy tube, g tube, j tube, [**Doctor Last Name 406**] X 4 (#1-gallbladder area, #2-pancreatic head, #3-body, #4-tail)  He remained intubated in the ICU with drains in place  Significant Events: -[**10-11**], underwent debridement of his pancreas with 1.5L of pus drained -[**10-14**] his wound culture started growing pan-sensitive Klebsiella and Viridans strep.
-[**11-4**] abd swab: Pseudomonas (S to ceftaz) -[**11-12**] CT showed a gastic fistula, and decreased pancreatic fluid collection -[**11-16**] Head CT WNL.
(s/p fall when attempting to get OOB while confused) -[**11-16**] CT Abd: Open wound in the mid upper abdomen, with significant amount of oral contrast leakage, suggestive of direct fistulous communication between the wound and stomach, possibly from the G tube site, or less likely loop of bowel, fluid collection with additional connection to the bowel loops.
[**11-17**]: transfused 2u PRBC, 2u FFP -[**11-25**] MRCP with secretin: no increase in peripanc fluid with secretin, stable 19x18mm fluid adj to PV, stable fluid [**Last Name (un) **] adj to panc uncinate with [**Last Name (LF) 19843**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] panc tissue in splenic hilum & uncinate, herosiderosis -[**11-25**] tracheostomy decannulated -[**12-2**] CTA: no PE  .

CT showed oral contrast extravasating into pancreatic area, concerning for enteric fistula.
[**11-14**] watching one more day, if afebrile will set abx course tomorrow and probably sign off.
Acute Renal Failure: Has had long SICU course complicated by wound dehiscence requiring multiple "wash-outs" and mesh placements.
Current issue is mesh disintegration secondary to Pseudomonas infection for which the patient was initially placed on gent+amikacin, and then colistin, all of which caused nephrotoxic ATN.
This was probably due to prolonged ICU course and due to fluid loss from his abdominal wound.
Post-op Hyperglycemia: Currently on Lantus [**Hospital1 **] and SS Regular which seems to have helped smooth out his highs and lows.
He was followed by [**Last Name (un) **] for continued blood glucose control.
Neuro: He had confusion in the ICU and at times was difficult to reorient.
He is now AA+O x 3, with no apparent deficits.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository [**Month/Year (2) **]: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
