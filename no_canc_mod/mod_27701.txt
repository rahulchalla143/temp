Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2128-1-23**]  Flexible [**Year/Month/Day **], tracheoplasty with mesh, right and left mainstem bronchus and bronchus intermedius bronchoplasty with mesh   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 69234**] is a 53-year-old woman who had previously undergone a cervical tracheal resection and reconstruction, as well as a posterior thoracic membranous wall tracheoplasty on [**2126-7-31**].
Ms. [**Known lastname 69234**] had previously had multiple surgeries requiring intubation in the past and was found have progressive dyspnea beginning in [**2124**].
She was also found to have tracheal stenosis in the cervical trachea, as well as more distal tracheomalacia.
The tracheal stenosis was resected as mentioned above and a wedge tracheoplasty of the membranous wall down past the thoracic inlet had been performed.
Repeat [**Known lastname **] noted that there was no significant residual tracheal stenosis, but there was diffuse tracheal bronchomalacia, most notably in the proximal and distal trachea, as well as right mainstem bronchus.
Unfortunately, she still did have a cough which was thought to be secondary to the foreign body.
This would involve a right thoracotomy and posterior tracheal splinting with a Marlex mesh.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2128-1-27**] IMPRESSION: Postoperative pleural effusions persistent and apparently unchanged when comparing frontal views.
Lateral view confirms loculated distribution along posterior pleural wall and upper portion of major fissure on right side.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 69234**] is a 53 year-old female with h/o tracheal stenosis, tracheobronchomalacia, sarcoidosis s/p VATS biopsy of the R lung, who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for scheduled tracheoplasty.
She was admitted to the SICU post-op for routine monitoring, Acute Pain Service placed an epidural preoperatively, which provided good pain control until POD#2, when the epidural was split, and a Dilaudid PCA was added for better pain control.
The chest-tube was removed and no pneumothorax was seen on chest x-ray.
The foley was removed and she voided without difficulty.
On POD #7 she underwent [**Hospital **] which revealed: The distal trachea had very minimal residual malacia.
The left mainstem had no significant malacia.
The right mainstem had very minimal residual malacia.
There were some thin, whitish secretions.
There was no purulence.
