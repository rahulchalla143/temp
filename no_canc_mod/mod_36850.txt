Brief Hospital Course: This is a 68 year-old male with a history of recent right ureter stent placement for nephrolithiasis who presents with sepsis from a urinary source.
# UTI with sepsis - he was initially admitted with hypotension and leukopenia to the ICU, where he received aggressive IVF and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Blood and urine cultures subsequently grew out E.coli, sensitive to Ciprofloxacin.
Abd CT and renal u/s showed no obstruction or hydronephrosis; his sepsis was attributed to BPH and recent rght ureteral stenting.
# ARF - initially admitted with a Cr of 3.3, secondary to pre-renal azotemia +/- ATN.
# AVNRT - history of AVNRT during his last admission, which recurred during this admission in the setting of BB discontinuation (while in the ICU), stress, and illness.
# BPH - transitioned to tamsulosin 0.4 mg qhs, passed voiding trial successfully.
Likely from sepsis vs. med effect with PPI and has been on Zosyn both known to cause thrombocytopenia.
