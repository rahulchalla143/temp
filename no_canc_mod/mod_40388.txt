She is now s/p [**Month/Year (2) 24785**] of L periprosthetic femur fracture, transferred post-operatively to MICU for hypotension and inability to wean ventilator in the PACU.
At [**Hospital1 18**], repeat head CT was negative for acute abnormalities.
Films of her LLE revealed periprosthetic femoral fracture.
She remained intubated as she was pulling small tidal volumes in the OR.
She spiked fevers in the PACU to 101.9.
She reportedly had episodes of SVT that resolved without intervention.
She later went into a sustained SVT, with a drop in her blood pressure.
12 lead ECG was obtained, showing rapid afib with RVR.
She was given metoprolol 5 mg and amiodarone 150 mg push without any appreciable change in her heart rate or rhythm.

Lateral incision with staples along L femur, clean, dry, intact.
No overlying erythema, ecchymosis, draining or induration.
Swan-neck deformities in bilat hands, deformed bilateral ankles.
Skin: Scattered ecchymosis on bilat arms and legs, with skin breakdown proximal to left olecranon process.
Sub-mm ST depressions in V4.
[**2-10**] ECG: Sinus rhythm.
Diffuse T wave changes which are non-specific.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Otherwise, no acute pulmonary process.
Question possible fracture, age indeterminate, of the left parasymphyseal superior pubic ramus.
Apparent left femur fracture due to immobilization device which limits evaluation of the pelvis as above.
[**2-10**] Left femoral film: Mid distal femoral diaphyseal fracture as detailed above.
Oblique fracture of the femoral diaphysis is redemonstrated.
[**2146-2-15**] RUQ U/S: (prelim) Limited portable examination, however, no significant intrahepatic biliary dilatation noted.
TTE: Moderate pulmonary hypertension with mildly dilated and hypokinetic RV as well as moderate functional tricuspid regurgitation.
No PE or acute aortic syndrome.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, worse on the right than the left.
83 y/o F with a history COPD (baseline 2L home O2 requirement), RA (on chronic prednisone 2.5 mg daily), hypertension, CHF, recent T LHA c/b CHF and afib who was initially transferred to medical floor from OSH on [**2-10**] for L periprosthetic femur fracture w/elevated INR, now s/p [**Month/Year (2) 24785**] on [**2-12**] with postoperative transfer to the MICU for hypotension and weaning off the vent; pt extubated on [**2-21**], transferred to the floor the evening of [**2-22**] in stable medical condition.
# s/p [**Month/Year (2) 24785**] L Femur: Patient underwent [**Month/Year (2) 24785**] for left femur fracture on [**2-12**].
# Hypotension: Resolved, present in post-operative period in setting of blood loss during [**Month/Year (2) 24785**] on [**2-12**].
Initially multiple possible etiologies, including hypovolemic (significant decrease in hgb/hct, despite two unit RBC transfusion this morning), sepsis (fevers in setting of recent surgery), adrenal insufficiency (on chronic glucocorticoid therapy), or cardiogenic (given ECG changes and SVT).
CVP was low and IVF was given with some improvement in her MAPs and decreased pressor requirement.
CTA was negative for PE and TTE showed RV hypokinesis suggesting that she may be more volume responsive.
Her steroids were also weaned back to her home dose (which she takes for rheumatoid arthritis).
Patient w/hx of atrial fibrillation in setting of recent L hip fracture, as chemically cardioverted on sotalol.
Hypotension limited amount of AV nodal blockade we can attempt.
She then had bradycardia and amiodarone had to be discontinued.
Eventually the patient was transitioned back to her home dose of sotolol which was uptitrated to 80 mg po bid as she developed a.fib with RVR on the home dose of 80 mg daily.
Pt was initially w/supratherapeutic INR at time of admission; coumadin was held and reversed in setting of pre-op period and dropping hct, which was likely due to bleeding at site of fracture.
# Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: recently diagnosed 2 months ago near time of initial L hip fracture, normal LVEF and valves per report from PCP.
# HCAP: The patient had difficulty being weaned from the ventilator post-operatively and her respiratory status was further compromised by presumed HCAP for which she was treated with vancomycin and zosyn, to be [**2146-2-20**].
# Anemia: Significant hct drop between PACU and arrival on floor.
# Rheumatoid arthritis: Initially continued PO prednisone but with hypotension was transitioned to stress dose glucocorticoids as above.
