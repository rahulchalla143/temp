ANTEPARTUM COURSE:  Remarkable for placenta previa and a prenatal ultrasound on [**2192-9-5**] showing fetal brain abnormality.
The level II ultrasound shows fusion of the frontal ventricular horns, bilateral ventriculomegaly, thin or dysplastic corpus collasum, and absent cavum septum pellucidum.
Mild corneal opacity noted.
Chest revealed no grunting, flaring, or retracing.
Cardiovascular revealed no murmurs.
RESPIRATORY:  The baby remained on room air, and there    were no respiratory issues.
No murmurs were noted.
Testosterone was 171 (normal range 280 to 800    for adults - but 171 within normal limits for a newborn).
A head    ultrasound was obtained on [**2192-9-17**]; confirming    the findings on the prenatal ultrasound of a thin corpus    callosum and absent cavum septum pellucidum.
Except for some mild    retinal hemorrhages - consistent with birth - the    examination was within normal limits, and optic nerves    were present.
No medications.
