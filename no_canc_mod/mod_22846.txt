On PE, she is noted to have slightly diminished mentation and nml neuro exam otherwise.
She has a hypertensive intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mild increase in size in the setting of continue HTN.

Patient is a 80 year old right handed woman hx of HTN and epistaxis who reports onset of severe headache on [**10-13**] at 11pm.
This headache was diffuse, and associated with nausea, and dry heaving, but not vomiting.
CT brain showed a left frontal hematoma.
Repeat CT brain showed left frontal hematoma measuring 4cm in diameter.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage was present in the left cerebral convexity.
There was no intraventricular extension.
No midline shift.
Neurosurgery was consulted but there was no neurosurgical intervention indicated.
Additional PMH: She has a hx of epistaxis starting in [**9-11**].
Most recent episode of epistaxis was 7 days ago.
HTN since [**2158**].
CT Head without Contrast ([**2170-10-14**]): Stable left inferior frontal lobe hemorrhage with SAH and mild mass effect on the left lateral ventricle from the study done 4 hrs.
To correlate with h/o trauma and further work up can be considered if there is no correlating h/o trauma.
Early mild hydrocephalus is not excluded.
CT Head without Contrast ([**2170-10-15**]): IMPRESSIONS: Inferior left frontal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema and local mass effect, diffuse left cerebral hemisphere subarachnoid hemorrhages, and intraventricular extension are not changed from 17 hours prior.
No new focus of hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, or new enlargement of the ventricles.
MRI/MRA Head ([**2170-10-15**]): Areas of intraparenchymal hematoma in the left frontal lobe with mass effect on the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], is redemonstrated.
No obvious abnormal enhancement is noted compared to the precontrast images.
Patent major intracranial arteries without focal flow limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm more than 3 mm within the resolution of MR angiogram.
Left frontal intraparenchymal hematoma  with scattered subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage.
No evidence of new bleeding.
CXR ([**2170-10-16**]): IMPRESSION: No evidence of pulmonary infectious process on single plain chest examination.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 4680**] is an 80 year-old right-handed woman with a history including HTN who initially presented to [**Hospital 47**] Hospital with headache and nausea.
A non-contrast CT of the head demonstrated a left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and care.
No intervention was thought to be necessary.
The neuroimaging documented a stable left inferior lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema and local mass effect in addition to diffuse left cerebral hemisphere subarachnoid hemorrhages.
An MRI, performed to evaluate for evidence of ischemia, confirmed CT findings.
Angiography studies showed that the major intracranial vessels were patent.
The etiology of the hemorrhage remains unclear; the patient denies preceding trauma, and the bleed is in a location uncharacteristic for hypertensive events.
It is possible that amyloid angiopathy is a contributing variable; for this reason aspirin has been discontinued.
# ID In the course of the hospitalization, the patient was found to have a urinary tract infection for which a three-day course of bactrim was started on [**2170-10-17**].
Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole 160-800 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for UTI for 3 days.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 2670**] & Rehab for [**Location (un) 5871**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left Frontal Hemorrhage, possibly due to amyloid angioathy   Discharge Condition: Stable.
The neurological condition is notable for a mild left pronator drift, left triceps weakness, and left finger extensor weakness in addition to a mild bilateral postural tremor.
A CT scan revealed bleeding in the brain, and you were transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
Repeat imaging demonstrated stability of the hemorrhage and surrounding swelling.
* The antibiotic bactrim was started to treat a urinary tract infection.
* Please seek medical attention if you develop a severe headache, vision changes, trouble speaking, difficulty walking, weakness - especially on one side of the body, shaking of the limbs, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or any other symptom you find concerning.
