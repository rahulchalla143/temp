She is well known to your practice and has been followed by you closely with serial echocardiograms, which have revealed worsening gradients and evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
She does complain significantly of dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and increasing fatigue.
She does deny any angina or syncope.
Past Medical History: Aortic stenosis/insufficiency, mitral stenosis/regurgitation(most likely rheumatic), hypertension, elevated cholesterol, atrial fibrillation, stroke with mild right-sided weakness, and osteoarthritis.
Abdomen was soft, nondistended, and nontender with positive bowel sounds.
No obvious varicosities were noted.
Neurologically, she is grossly intact with mild right upper extremity weakness.
The systolic murmur transmits to both carotids.
The left atrium is markedly dilated and is elongated.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
Mod to severe left atrial contrast is noted.2.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened with some calcification.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2) by continuity equation, area 1.1 by planimetry which is likely inaccurate due to calcification.
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity.
There is mild mitral valve prolapse of the anterior leaflet and restriction of the posterior leaflet..
There is moderate valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2).
Mild mitral regurgitation is seen.
A tissue mitral valve is seen.
Trace central MR jet is seen, NO perivalvular leaks.
A tissue aortic valve is seen.
No periventricular leaks are noted.
Electrophysiologic interrogation of her permanent pacemaker revealed that she was pacemaker dependent with an underlying rhythm of 40 beats per minute, irregular and with prolonged pauses.
Coumadin was started given that she has a history of atrial fibrillation and she underwent a MAZE procedure.
Coumadin 4 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: titrate for an INR goal of [**1-31**] for atrial fibrillation.

These include redness, drainage or increased pain.
In the event that you have drainage from your sternal wound, please contact the [**Name2 (NI) 5059**] at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1504**].
4)  No lotions, creams or powders to incision until it has healed.
Gently pat the wound dry.
