There was no reported loss of consciousness or incontinence.
The CT scan was negative for pulmonary embolism, but showed congestive heart failure.
Patient was admitted to medicine service for diuresis for presumed congestive heart failure and fall.

Patient initially responded well to diuresis, but then further lasix held [**10-11**] to [**10-13**] due to metabolic alkalosis.
Lasix was restarted on [**10-13**] for increasing shortness of breath, worsening failure by clinical exam.
CXR at this time showed worsened congestive heart failure with right greater than left pleural effusion.
Respiratory Failure: Felt to be multifactorial secondary to CHF, OSA, pulmonary hypertension, possible pneumonia, and possible right diaphragmatic weakness.
She was noted to have some thick brown secretions.
She was scheduled to have a fluoroscopic SNIF on the day of discharge which they were unable perform due to her compromised respiratory status.
a. CHF: Pt has EF 60% with known diastolic dysfunction.
She was diuresed several liters and improved, but then developed contraction alkalosis.
Pt then gained several pounds and was noted to have episodic desaturations.
She clearly has a weight-related obstructive sleep apnea.
c. Pulmonary hypertension secondary to obesity- hypoventilation syndrome: Pt is on home 3 L nasal canula.
There was no suggestion of cardiac, metabolic or neurolgical cause.
An echo was obtained which showed 3+ MR. 2+ TR, worsened oulmonary hypertension, as well as an echodense mass in left ventricle apex, likely thickened, calcified chordal structure.
Patient was monitored on telemetry and was noted to have bradycardia which was not associated with hypotension.
Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes: Pt noted to have some increase in size of paratrachial lymph nodes since [**3-22**].
Pt was seen by pulmonary who recommended no intervention at this time but follow up CT scan in 6 months when heart failure compensated.
It was felt that given the absence of mass, the enlarged lymph nodes were unlikely to be secondary to malignancy.
Metabolic Alkalosis: Some element of chronic increased CO2 from OSA.
Pt developed contraction alkalosis from over-diuresis for CHF.
Sinus Bradycarida: Pt was evaluated by electrophysiology on [**10-21**] for bradycardia to 30s with stable blood pressure.
They felt this was likely secondary to obesity hypoventilation syndrome and that it was not consistent with sick sinus syndrome.
Given stable hemodynamics, EP felt there was no indication for pacemaker.
Likely anemia of chronic disease.
Diabetes Mellitus complicated by neuropathy: Patient was monitored with fingersticks QID.
She should be transitioned back to home diabetic medications.
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: One [**Age over 90 1230**]y (150) mg PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Hypercarbic respiratory failure Congestive heart failure Fall Secondary: Obesity Hypoventilation syndrome pulmonary hypertension Diabetes mellitus bronchomalacia Congestive Heart Failure, diastolic Peripheral neuropathy Cervical spondylosis Hyperparathyroidism   Discharge Condition: stable.
