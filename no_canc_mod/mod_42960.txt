REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: s/p ORIF AP VIEW OF THE PELVIS [**2196-10-19**]  HISTORY: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with right hip pain, status post fall, and "foreshortened" externally-rotated leg, status post ORIF.
FINDINGS: Limited perioperative bedside AP examination with no comparisons on record, demonstrates numerous skin staples and subcutaneous emphysema in the soft tissues overlying the right hip, consistent with recent ORIF of displaced comminuted inter- and subtrochanteric fracture of the right proximal femur.
Also noted is a left bipolar hip prosthesis with cemented femoral stem (distal tip, also not included) in overall satisfactory position.
Also noted is diffuse osteopenia, apparent lower lumbosacral scoliosis with associated asymmetric degenerative changes, extensive vascular calcification and fecoloaded left colon, with air- filled rectum.
; LOWER EXTREMITY FLUORO WITHOUT  Reason: IM HIP NAILING]  HISTORY: _____ hip nailing.
These demonstrate portions of an intramedullary rod, with distal interlocking screw, superimposed over the femur, with evidence of a subtrochanteric femoral fracture.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess for fx PELVIS AND RIGHT HIP RADIOGRAPHIC SERIES PERFORMED ON [**2196-10-19**].
CLINICAL HISTORY: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with right hip pain, status post fall with foreshortened and externally rotated leg, evaluate for fracture.
An acute right proximal femoral fracture is noted with irregular margins, at a subtrochanteric loevel.
Left hip hemiarthroplasty is noted, with prosthesis appearing intact and in good position.
Degenerative changes are noted in the lower lumbar spine, with associated scoliosis.
Subtrochanteric fracture of the right proximal femur.
Left hip hemiarthroplasty hardware appears intact, though inferior aspect of the femoral stem is not included.
Degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2196-10-21**] 1:58 PM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: acute process  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with acute abdomin REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: acute process HISTORY: Acute abdomen.
FINDINGS: Single portable upright chest radiograph performed at 14:10 p.m. demonstrates increase in left small pleural effusion.
A new right apical opacity and increasing left perihilar opacity are present, likely representing aspiration.
There is no pneumothorax.
S-shaped scoliosis with degenerative changes are unchanged.
Increase in small left pleural effusion.
Increase in left perihilar and new right apical opacities, likely representing aspiration.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT) PORT  [**2196-10-21**] 1:31 PM  ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT) PORT  Reason: acute process, free air  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with distended tender abdomen REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: acute process, free air HISTORY: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with distended tender abdomen concerning for acute intra-abdominal process including free intra-abdominal air.
FINDINGS: _____ view of the upper abdomen and a supine radiograph of the abdomen and pelvis show normal bowel gas pattern and no evidence of intra-abdominal free air.
A moderate amount of stool is seen in the rectum and sigmoid colon.
Again seen is a displaced comminuted inter- and sub-trochanteric fracture of the right proximal femur that is status post ORIF.
There is subcutaneous emphysema seen in the right hip consistent with history of recent ORIF.
Also noted is a left bipolar hip prosthesis.
Diffuse vascular calcifications are seen.
Scoliosis and degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracic and lumbar spine.
Osteopenia is again noted.
IMPRESSION: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with no evidence of free intraperitoneal air on this technically limited study.
Moderate amount of stool is seen in the rectum and sigmoid colon.
She received a R cephalomedullary nail for this fracture by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of orthopaedic surgery on [**2196-10-19**].
Her postoperative course was complicated by hypovolemia and a reduced hematocrit for which she was transfused 2u pRBC and she was monitored on tele for Afib.
On POD1 she was noted to have decreased urine output with a rising Cr, and geriatric medicine and renal were consulted.
On POD2 pt was noted to have decreased mental status, cool extremities, and a distended and exquisitely tender abdomen.
Renal and medicine consults were notified, pt was transferred to SICU, and general surgery was consulted for her abdominal pain.
After a cvl was placed, she was emergently taken to the OR with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of general surgery for an exploratory laparotomy which revealed grossly ischemic bowel with worsening lactate and acidosis.
