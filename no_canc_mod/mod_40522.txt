Patient reports that 2 weeks ago she developed an upper respiratory infection with a cough, runny nose and shortness of breath.
Cough was production with one episode of blood tinged sputum.
She noted increasing shortness of breath 4 days ago.
Two days ago she developed N/V (4 episodes of vomiting at home), as well as abd pain and intermittent sub sternal chest pain.
The chest pain is poorly characterized, sometimes worse with eating and deep inspiration, non-radiating.
She also notes that she has had dysuria x 1 week, and ?
of urinary frequency.
Labs notable for elevated [**Doctor First Name **] 190, elevated lip 374, bicarb 6, AG 16 (gap and non-gap acidosis), BUN/Cr 54/1.7 (baseline cr 1.0-1.1), K 5.5, WBC 10 (baseline 5), Hct elevated at 41.9 (baseline 28-32).
Admitting resident noted that patient was increasingly tachypneic.
Given her increased respiratory rate and concern for her metabolic derangements, she was transferred to the unit for further monitoring.
At present, she feels that her shortness of breath is slightly improved.
She is denying chest pain, abdominal pain, pain over renal or pancreatic graft or nausea.
She denies diarrhea - has not moved her bowels in several days.

Normal gallbladder and no biliary ductal dilatation.
Small subcentimeter hepatic parenchymal calcification is of doubtful significance and may represent a calcified granuloma or other remote insult.
Renal Transplant US: IMPRESSION: Doppler flow demonstrated within the transplanted pancreas and kidneys, with mildly elevated resistive indices as described.
No evidence of abnormal fluid collections adjacent to the transplanted organs.
No evidence of hydronephrosis within the transplanted kidney.
Transplanted pancreas appears of homogeneous echotexture.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Diffuse sinus disease.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
A secundum type atrial septal defect is present.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Impression: secundum atrial septal defect; no resting outflow tract gradient is present at this time .
CT Abd/Pelvis: CT OF ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The liver is diffusely hypodense consistent with fatty infiltration.
The gallbladder has normal appearance with no stones.
Extensive vascular calcification is noted within the aorta and its major branches.
No free air or fluid is seen within the abdomen.
Few small areas of low attenuation are visualized in the transplanted kidney likely representing simple cysts.
No fatty stranding is seen surrounding the transplanted pancreas to suggest pancreatitis.
The urinary bladder, distal ureters, and pelvic loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable.
BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen.
No evidence of pancreatitis, pseudocysts, or stones is seen within the patient native pancreas or transplanted pancreas.
Status post kidney transplant with no evidence of stone or hydronephrosis.
Multiple hypodense lesions within the transplanted kidney most likely represent simple cysts.
Small right pleural effusion vs. pleural thickening is without change.
No focal areas of consolidation are present.
Persistent right pleural effusion vs. pleural thickening  Brief Hospital Course: Elevated Pancreatic Enzymes: Patient had elevated pancreatic enzymes on admission.
Native vs. tranplant pancreatitis was considered, though patient was asymptomatic.
Patient was hydrated for volume depletion.
Ultrasound was negative for any acute rejection.
There was no evidence of stones or hypertriglyceremia.
CT abd/pelvis was negative for pancreatitis.
Given her anatomy, we thought she may be having reflux causing her enzymes to increase.
Transplant surgery thought her elevated enzymes were due to relux.
These fluctuations were thought an exacerbation of her chronic process.
Patient appeared to have a metabolic acidosis w/ respiratory compensation.
The source of her acidosis was initially unclear; renal failure and infection were both consiered.
No new medications.
After ruling out other causes, her acidosis was thought due to her pancreatic fistula draining into the GU tract and her inability to take her bicarb supplement PO.
Her pain resolved.
However, she remained orthostatic with dizziness while standing.
She also had an episode of chest discomfort a few hours later.
EKG showed TWIs inferiorly and anterolaterally.
Her CEs became positive with Troponin in the 0.3-0.4.
Repeat EKG showed persistent changes.
They felt that her episode was related to her HOCM and hypotension, with subendocardial ischemia despite mild CAD on previous cath.
We treated her supportively, and maintained her positive fluid status.
SOB/cough:  Patient had mild SOB and cough.
CXR showed possible vacular congestion.
There was no evidence of pneumonia.
ARF: Patient was thought in pre-renal azotemia due to her inability to take POs on admission and volume depletion.
She was initially put on Cipro, then Bactrim, then finally Cefpodoxime for a 10 day course given her history of immunosupression  and transplant.
ACEI was held given her orthostasis and renal dysfunction.
