Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation   History of Present Illness: 80 year-old woman with a past medical history significant for emphasema, hypertension, and recent subdural hematoma s/p right craniotomy who was transferred to the medicine intensive care unit from the neurosurgery service for respiratory distress.
The patient was admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] as transfer from OSH with new right subdural hematoma and left hemiparesis discovered after the patient was found unresponsive at her [**Hospital3 **] facility.
After starting G-tube feeds and being positive 1.5L, the patient was found to be in respiratory distress with thick white secretions suctioned.
Patient was evaluated by MICU who felt her respiratory distress was likely due to volume overload.
Patient was felt to still be volume overloaded and in failure.
Patient was somnulent, reported beign short of breath, denied any chest pain or abdominal pain.
HEENT: Ecchymoses and swelling over left eye.
Slight withdrawal of right but not left upper and lower extremities.
GEN: intubated, sedated HEENT: AT, NC, PERRLA, no conjuctival injection, anicteric, OP clear, MMDry, Neck supple, no LAD, JVP to ear CV: Tachy regular, II/VI LSB PULM: Poor air movement, tight, end expiratory wheeze throughout, dullness/crackles b/l bases.
ABD: soft, NT, ND, + BS, no HSM EXT: warm, dry, +2 distal pulses BL NEURO: sedated, no asterixis .
Pertinent Results: Head CT([**7-13**]) FINDINGS: There is a large hyperdense subdural hematoma with areas of isodensity layering over the right cerebral convexity measuring approximately 1 cm in greatest diameter.
There is mild effacement of the right lateral ventricle with expansion of the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] concerning for trapped left ventricle.
Extensive periventricular white matter hypodensities are noted and consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
A large amount of soft tissue swelling is seen over the left periorbital soft tissues (2, 10) and over the left calvarium.
There is no evidence of acute fracture.
There is opacification of the sphenoid sinus, left greater than right and minimal opacification of the left maxillary sinus.
Post-operative pneumocephalus overlying both frontal convexities of the small amount of residual high-density subdural blood is apparent.
There is also a new focus of either intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right temporal lobe, measuring 2.5 x 1.8 cm (2:7) - previously there was a small amount of blood products in this region and this new finding may represent blooming of a contusion.
There is decreased shift of the normally midline structures, with now 6 mm of leftward midline shift (previously 10 mm).
The ventricular size is stable and there is no evidence of intraventricular blood.
Extensive periventricular hypoattenuation consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic disease is unchanged.
Basal ganglia calcifications noted.
There remains moderate opacification of the sphenoid sinuses and ethmoid air cells.
There is also new orbital emphysema seen anterior and medial to the left globe.
Soft tissue swelling overlying the craniotomy site is within normal post-operative limits.
Interval increase in right inferior temporal parenchymal contusion as well as slight increase in the right frontoparietal extra-axial collection.
Stable degree of shift of the septum pellucidum.
Persistent orbital emphysema.
Stable right subdural hematoma and right temporal parenchymal contusion with slight decrease in mass effect.
Resolving left temporal subdural hematoma.
Opacification of the sphenoid sinuses and mastoid air cells most likely due to intubation.
C-Spine CT([**7-13**]) IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute fracture.
Severe degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
X-rays Lt Wrist([**7-13**]) FINDINGS: There is soft tissue irregularity and gas seen along the dorsum of the hand.
No radiopaque foreign densities are seen.
There are no signs for acute fractures.
There is an old healed fracture deformity of the fifth metacarpal.
Persistent intraorbital extraconal air, which could be secondary to tiny nondisplaced superior orbital fracture.
Slight increase in right extra-axial collection as well as right inferior frontal lobe parenchymal hemorrhagic contusion.
Redemonstration of mastoid air cells opacification as well as fluid levels in the sphenoid sinus.
Chronic wedge compression fracture of the L3, T12, T11, and T10.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectases.
Acute fractures of the left 10th rib.
CXR [**7-30**] - There are low inspiratory volumes, lower than on [**2153-7-28**].
There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.
There is a small left effusion, with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
Osteopenia, old fracture of the left proximal humerus, and degenerative changes and thoracic spine compression fractures are again noted, unchanged.
CXRs showed LLL opacification that improved over time, consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
Of note, patient had anemia throughout stay, was transfused one unit on [**7-23**] and has stayed stable since then.
WBC peaked at 18 when pneumonia was diagnosed, has steadily gone down since treatment started.
Brief Hospital Course: Hospital Course on Neurosurgery service: ([**Date range (1) 79637**]) SDH: Patient was admitted and emergently underwent a left craniotomy for an acute right SDH.
She continued to have right-sided hemiplegia stable from the time of admission.
A post-op CT showed typical post-operative changes with decreased mass effect.
On [**7-17**] she had an abd CT which showed a large hiatal hernia.
Pt aspirated, became hypoxic, and was transferred to the MICU on [**7-19**].
80 y/o female HTN, emphysema, s/p craniotomy for SDH evacuation intubated for hypoxic respiratory distress, now with pneumonia (etiology likely multifactorial -- aspiration PNA/pleural effusions) and urinary tract infection.
# Respiratory Failure: Pt suffered from an aspiration PNA 2' to TFs.
Pathogen determined to be Hafnia Alvei in the sputum (enteric GNR), treated w/ an 8 day course of Levaquin.
Her respiratory distress was also likely complicated by layering pleural effusions, followed by CXR and treated w/ intermittent Lasix diuresis.
Thought to have CHF as well(mildly elevated BNP on admission, decreased while in ICU).
COPD exacerbation was less likely, but pt had a 3 day prednisone burst that was completed on 7.20. she was also continued on Qvr and nebulizers (albuterol as needed and iptratropium standing.)
Unlikely her distress was caused by PE (although this was of concern initially) given neg LENIs, no ECG changes, no hypotension.
# Fevers: Patient had low grade temps and leukocytosis while in ICU.
Both H. alvei and E. coli were fluoroquinolone sensitive.
her differential showed an elevated Eosinophil count, that trended down w/ d/c of Vanc/Zosyn.
Initial c/f ACCY given elevated LFTs, but no evidence of acute cholecystitis on RUQ U/S.
Elevated LFTs likely related to propofol and were trending down at time of d/c.
She had some tenderness on abdominal exam c/f a rectus sheath hematoma, but her Abd CT was neg for internal bleeding.
# Sinus Tachycardia: Likely hypovolemia (CVP low, Echo shows LVH, hyperdynamic systolic function w/ EF > 75%, TropT < 0.01) vs. respiratory distress vs pain (post-op) vs infection vs. agitation.
She had no pain, or tenderness in legs, and negative LENIs.
Albuterol was used whenever possible over iptratropium to decrease non-specific B1 antagonization and increased tachycardia.
# Subdural Hematoma, s/p evacuation.
Rpt Head Ct on 7.25 showed diminishing SDH and decrease in mass effect.
# Elevated Lipase: No evidence of ACCY on RUQ U/S.
# Metabolic Alkalosis: likely contraction + cerebral alkalosis related to SDH.
K was agressively repleted to promote H+ shift into cells and decrease bicarbonate reabsorption and ammoniagenesis in the renal PCT.
She also received oral prednisone again starting on [**2153-7-30**] for recurrent wheezing and improved.
# Hypertension: stable.
# Hyperlipidemia: held simvastatin, elevated LFTs .
# Depression: hold paroxetine .
# Subdural hematomas were stable.
They recommend repeat CT scan which showed stable resolution of the subdural bleeds.
# Was tachycardic up to 150s.
Think the tachycardia is likely atrial tach due to her pulmonary disease.
# For COPD started 5 day steroid course for COPD exaccerbation.
# Other issues were stable.
[**Month (only) 116**] be a result of her Keppra treatment.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] with a diagnosis of subdural hematoma (a bleed in the brain) due to a fall you had at your rehabilitation center.
You had surgery to drain the bleed from your brain, and had a tube placed in your stomach (A G-tube) because you had  large hiatal hernia and needed access so you could eat.
You also had an aspiration pneumonia resulting in respiratory disgress that required you be mechanically ventilated and a urinary tract infection.
Both pneumonia and UTI were treated with an 8 day course of the antibiotic levoquin.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
