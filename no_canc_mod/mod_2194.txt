Admission Date:  [**2165-11-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2165-11-8**]  Date of Birth:   [**2096-12-16**]       Sex:  F  Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year-old female with a past medical history significant for hyperlipidemia and hypertension who on a routine physical examination had received an electrocardiogram that showed questionable T wave inversions.
She ultimately was scheduled for an exercise treadmill test that was positive, which led to a cardiac catheterization prior to this admission showing 100% occlusion of the right coronary artery and a tight proximal left anterior descending coronary artery lesion with a normal ejection fraction in the order of 50 to 70%.
She has had a transient ischemic attack and stroke in the past.
She has no real residual neurologic deficits in the way of motor, however.
She has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.
ALLERGIES:  Penicillin for which she gets a rash and hives.
She was in no acute distress.
There was no carotid bruit.
There were no rales, rhonchi or wheeze.
There was no heaves or murmur.
There was a well healed laparotomy scar that is noted in the midline, otherwise bowel sounds are present.
Extremities are warm, well profuse, palpable pulses dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial symmetric bilaterally.
No varicosities are seen in the lower extremities and no edema.
She therefore was evaluated and admitted on [**2165-11-4**] for an elective coronary artery bypass graft with the presumptive diagnosis of asymptomatic coronary artery disease with left main lesion.
She had no exudate or drainage.
There was no gross evidence of erythema.
She was without chest tubes, Foley or pacing wires.
Due to her rapid progress and her uncomplicated postoperative course it was deemed that she was appropriate and stable for discharge to home without any services.
Status post coronary artery bypass graft times three, left internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to oblique marginal and right coronary artery for significant left main disease and three vessel coronary artery disease, normal ejection fraction.
Total gastrectomy for carcinoma in [**2158**] with B-12 deficiency.
Transient ischemic attack with a cerebrovascular accident and seizure disorder.
