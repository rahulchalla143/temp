[**6-24**] CT A/perfusion: Decreased blood flow and volume, increased MTT in cerebellar hemispheres and vermis in matched distribution compatible with infarction with no penumbra identified.
Thrombus in the basilar artery with possible extension to the left vertebral artery.
[**6-25**] Echo: Biventricular cavity dilation with severe global biventricular hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, multivessel CAD, etc.)
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No definite cardiac  ource of embolism identified.
Moderate mitral egurgitation.
[**6-24**]: Significant worsening of mass effect associated with evolving right cerebellar infarction, causing effacement of the fourth ventricle and perimesencephalic cisterns, interval dilatation of the third and lateral ventricles, consistent with acute obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: Admission impression: 57year old male with severe PVD, CAD, now presenting with dizziness, nausea and dysarthria found to have vertebrobasilar occlusion.
His examination is notable for R gaze preference, low vision in L eye, R pronator drift, dysmetria R > L. Etiology of embolus is likely cardioembolic with subtherapeutic INR.
Pt is not a candidate for IV or IA tPA or MERCI retrieval given presentation outside window for intervention, extent of thrombus in the vessel presents risks of hemorrhage that outweigh potential benefits.
[**6-25**] he had increased right sided weakness but has some movement, was alert, oriented, dysarthric, and following commands.
In the late afternoon he had an abrupt decompensation with decreased alterness, decreased movement of the left side a more right sided weakness, along with agonal breathing pattern.
He was intubated and taken for stat head CT which found significant swelling of the right cerebellar stroke with compression of the brainstem and development of hydrocephalus.
Overnight his pupils became unresponsive and he lost his right corneal reflex.
Overnight there were extensive conversations with the family reguarding the severity of the situation.
CV: Pt was in a. fib with RVR requiring diltiazem drip on [**6-26**].
He had heart failure with EF 25%.
Resp: He was intubated for agonal breathing on [**6-25**].
ID: Developed fever on [**6-26**] up to 103.
