Respiratory failure - This 70 year old female with severe COPD s/p trach was transfered from Rehab with respiratory failure most likely secondary to COPD exacerbation.
Her respiratory failure was felt to be most likely bronchospastic secondary to severe COPD and superimposed infection.
She might also have some component of fluid overload.
She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics given high risk since she was coming from a nursing home.
On [**5-20**] she grew Stenotrophomonas in her sputum and Timentin was added for coverage.
She was able to tolerate pressure support however every occasion when the PEEP was decreased below 8 she had episodes of desaturation and respiratory difficulty.
On [**5-22**] a bronchoscopy was performed on which she was noted to have posterior membrane collapse on exalation with agitation.
She was continued on steroids and nebs as treatment for her COPD.
In addition she was treated briefly with IV Aminophyline which she tolerated without complication.
She was also diuresed aggressively for possible fluid overload as a cause of increased respiratory failure.
On [**5-27**] she began to have copious bloody secretions per her trachostomy.
These were initially felt to be due to trauma and it they were monitored.
These bloody secretions continued for several days and repeat CXR showed increased nodular densities.
Given concern for vasculitis vs. trauma vs. other cause of hemoptysis.
On [**5-29**] a bronchoscopy was performed which showed diffuse oozing blood in all airways, no focal bleeding source.
A chest CT was also performed which showed bilateral upper love consolidation with nodular opacification.
She was briefly treated with Voriconazole and cyclophosphamide with concern for fungal infection vs. vasculitis.
These were d/cd given low clinical suspicion as well as a normal ESR and CRP.
It was felt that the most likely cause of bleeding was still trauma for suctioning and the frequency of suctioning was decreased.
Pt died on [**6-12**] from respiratory failure.
Hypotension - She had some hypotension post diuresis which resolved with fluid.
She had no further hypotension on admission.
Throughout admission she had episodes of tachycardia, diaphoresis, hypertension, and hypoxia.
These episodes were felt to be due to agitation.
A Triptase was normal indicating no allergic reaction.
Her pain was controlled with morphine.
They felt that she might have some level of delerium and held all benzos.
She was treated with Haldol as needed for agitation.
She was continued on calcium channel blockers for tachycardia.
She was monitored for diarrhea given the inititation of antibiotics, and had no further diarrhea.
She had some Hyponatremia on admission which resolved with NS IV fluid.
CAD/HTN - She was continued on Diltiazem for a.fib and BP control.
Her HCT dropped at which time she was noted to have some guiaic positive stool.
PPx -  She was treated with Heparin SC for DVT prophylaxis.
Rt LE swelling - LENIs were performed for some LE swelling, they were negative for DVT.
