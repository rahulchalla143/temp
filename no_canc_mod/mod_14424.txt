Pt was found to have bilateral carotid stenosis (moderate on right, severe on left) by her PCP and was scheduled to have an elective CEA on the left.
She denies chest pain but it was recommended that she have a cardiac work-up prior to her CEA.
On [**2198-10-30**], pt underwent an excercise test with nuclear imaging which produced chest pain at a low work load.
The imaging showed evidence of inferolateral and posterolateral ischemia and infero-apical infarction.
However, two days prior to this admission, pt was shopping and experienced a sharp substernal chest pain that radiated across her chest and into her left arm associated with diaphoresis, no SOB, no nausea.
Later that day, she experienced that same chest pain, associated with diaphoresis but this time, she was at rest.
She called her cardiologist and he suggested that she come to the hospital given that these sx were suggestive of unstable angina.
At that time, she ruled out for MI with enzymes and EKG and cardiac catheterization was done.
On [**2198-11-20**], cardiac cath showed severe multivessel CAD with high grade stenosis of the proximal and mid-LAD, large D1 and D2 branches, ostial LCx and ostial RCA.
