New FLAIR/T2 signal abnormalities within the medial parieto-occipital lobes, bilaterally with associated petechial hemorrhage and mild enhancement.
Areas of slow diffusion within the splenium and right thalamus appear to have progressed to venous infarction (with surrounding cytotoxic edema).
These findings are most consistent with changes from subacute-to-chronic venous occlusive disease/venous hypertension  2.
Residual hemorrhage present within the left thalamus and right frontoparietal lobe.
Trace hemorrhage remains in the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles.
Internal cerebral veins remain less visible, however.
EEG [**2110-11-20**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal extended routine EEG due to a moderately slow and disorganized background.
There were intermittent generalized blunted sharp wave discharges that at times appeared pseudoperiodic.
The latter finding in combination with generalized background slowing is indicative of an underlying moderate encephalopathy.
Potential causes include but are not limited to: medication effect, metabolic/ toxic, or infectious disturbances.
Additionally, the brief intermittent bursts of generalized delta slowing of background are indicative of deep midline cerebral dysfunction.
CXR [**2110-11-20**]: Borderline cardiomegaly unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
Cerebral angiogram [**2110-11-24**]: FINDINGS: Right common carotid artery arteriogram shows that the right common carotid artery is widely patent with no evidence of stenosis at the bifurcation.
The intracranial runs demonstrate that the right internal carotid artery fills well along the cervical, petrous, cavernous and supraclinoid portion.
Both anterior and middle cerebral arteries are seen normally with no evidence of aneurysms or dural AV fistula.
The external carotid artery branches did not show any evidence of AV dural fistula.
The superior sagittal sinus and both transverse sinuses including the torcula is patent.
Right common femoral artery arteriogram shows widely patent right common femoral artery.
KUB [**2110-11-30**]: There is no free air.
There is air seen in the small and large bowel and the rectum in a non-specific pattern.
There are some degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 91562**] was admitted to the neurology service on [**2110-11-18**] after being transferred from [**Hospital **] hospital for further workup of intermittent episodes of somnolence.
Repeat MRI/MRV showed some new areas of signal abnormality in the b/l medial occipital lobes, as well as areas of restricted diffusion in the splenium and R thalamus suggestive of subacute to chronic [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusion.
EEG showed evidence of diffuse encephalopathy but no epileptiform activity.
She was also found to have several metabolic disturbances which were likely contributing to her somnolence.
She was also treated for hypernatremia to 150.
She was also maintained on CPAP for severe OSA.
An angiogram was performed on [**2110-11-26**] to better evaluate her thrombosis and showed clear cerebral venous sinuses with no evidence of thrombosis or occlusion.
On [**11-30**] she was witnessed to have brownish-colored emesis which was heme positive.

Hold if patient has loose stools.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
An MRI of your brain showed stable appearance of the bleeding in your brain but also showed slight worsening of the abnormalities in your thalamus on both sides (an area important for staying awake).
You were also found to have a high sodium level and very low levels of thyroid hormone.
You were continued on antibiotics for your urinary tract infection.
Your sleepiness is likely due to a combination of all of these factors.
You were evaluated by speech therapy but continued to have difficulty swallowing during your admission.
