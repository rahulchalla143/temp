Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], Pt was without chest pain and transferred imeediately to cath lab.
Catherization revealed 70% LM, 80% LAD and 80% mRCA disease with initial PCWP 26.
However during the procedure Pt became hypotensive requiring Dopamine and an IABP placed without HD effect.
Angiogram of femoral artery revealed extravasation with apparent RP bleed.
At conclusion, there was no evidence of continued extravasation and Pt transferred to CCU for continued management.

As detailed above, cath significant for LMCA, mid LAD and RCA disease; thus no intervention taken.
Pt remained stable and without chest pain over the following few days.
Pt did not go immediately for CABG, given uncertainity as to her the benefit of bypass, amount of viable myocardium that would be salvagable, especially in light of her recent RP bleed.
A resting MIBI was performed which showed a: "mild to moderate, fixed defect in the distal anterior wall and apex, without reversibility at 24 hours."
The LAd had a 80% ostial stenosis and the LCX had a 60% ostial stenosis.
An IVC angiogram revealed an organized thrombus in the distal IVC and an IVC filter was placed."
2) Pump:  Pt with EF 40% by cath and 30% by echo, who remained euvolemic during hospitalization.
Repeat Echo showed: "left atrium is moderately dilated.
(EF 35%) Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include apical, mid and apical akinesis and inferoapcal akinesis.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen."
3) Vascular:  As per HPI, Pt with right femoral artery perforation controlled with baloon tamponade in the cath lab.
Pt required no additional transfusions as Hct remained stable for the remainder of her hospital stay.
She was found to have a IVC clot during her second cardiac catheterization and an IVC filter was placed.
A bilateral venous U/S was performed which showed rt normal, lt chronic non-occlusive thrombus of superficial femoral vein.
There was no indication for a hypercoagulable work-up at this time given her high risk of clots secondary to immobility.
ST elevation MI s/p catheterization with 3 stent placement 2.
Retroperitoneal bleed Secondary diagnosis 1.
Hypertension 2.
Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Good  Discharge Instructions: Continue to take all medications as prescribed.
