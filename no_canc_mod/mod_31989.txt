Has been having some mild confusion off/on for the last week or so.
Also some nonspecific blurriness of his vision in all fields, which his family attributed to cataracts and dirty glasses.
Then had a mild to moderate headache at 5pm.
Was also noting some difficulty finding things at that time.
Then around 7 pm felt that headache was much worse.
CT scan showed right occipital hemorrhage into the ventricle, and pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]  ROS: no headaches prior to today.
vision changes as described above.
Also complains of some difficulty swallowing.
Past Medical History: HTN CAD s/p stents Rheumatoid arthritis Glaucoma prostate enlargement basal cell ca  All: Cipro/levoflox: anaphylaxis  Social History: Patient was previously functional.
Father had MI at 47.
Orientation: Oriented to person, place, and date but mildly confused and initially does not get month or date correct.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Reflexes: B T Br Pa Ac Right     2 2  2  2  1 Left      3 2  2  3  1 Toes down right, up left Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements, heel to shin  Pertinent Results: HEAD CT W/O CONTRAST [**2113-2-20**]: Large right-sided hemorrhage, predominantly centered within the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] with adjacent mass effect on the brain parenchyma.
There is mild leftward subfalcine herniation and dilatation of the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
MRI with contrast will be helpful to evaluate for possible underlying lesion or vascular malformation  CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS [**2113-2-20**]: 1.
Unchanged appearance of right-sided intraparenchymal hemorrhage with extension into the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle.
Mild mass effect, indicated by slight midline shift, is unchanged.
No evidence for aneurysm or AVM or other vascular abnormality.
However, a compressed AVM, secondary to mass effect, with resultant tamponade cannot be excluded as source of bleed.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2113-2-21**]: No significant interval change in the intraventricular hemorrhage; no new hemorrhage.
Slightly increased edema, but no significant change in degree of mass effect.
Ventricles are unchanged in size with no transependymal edema to suggest hydrocephalus.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2113-2-26**]: No change in large right occipital hemorrhage extending into right lateral ventricle.
No new site of hemorrhage.
Slight decrease in degree of blood in left lateral ventricle  LE Ultrasound [**2113-2-27**]: No evidence of DVT seen in either lower extremity.
No significant change in the size and appearance of the large right temporal intraparenchymal and right lateral ventricular hemorrhage.
No new hemorrhage.

On admission, pt had gross left homonymous hemianopsia, but otherwise non-focal exam.
CTA was performed to rule out any vascular anomalies.
CT head demonstrated no significant changes.
Due to episode of hypotension on [**2-25**], an EKG was performed, and pt was ruled out with cardiac enzymes x 3 q 8 hours which was negative.
Intraventricular hemorrhage: Patient continued to have delirium without agitation.
Repeat head CT on [**3-3**] showed no change.
Fevers: Patient had low grade fevers on [**2-26**] and [**2-27**].
Hyponatremia: Pt developed Hyponatremia secondary to SIADH.
Hyponatremia was treated with fluid restriction of 1200cc per day and had resolved by discharge.
Rash: Blanching papular rash developed on back thought secondary to contact dermatitis since patient has sensitive skin.
Rash improved with steroid cream.
Rheumatoid arthritis: His methotrexate and leucovorin were stopped due to drug interactions with dilantin.
8. h/o Coronary artery disease s/p stents: ASA held as above.
We found an intraventricular hemorrhage on CAT scan.
