Admission Date:  [**2134-7-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2134-7-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2087-9-20**]     Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46 year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy thought secondary to chronic Lyme disease versus chronic alcohol use with an ejection fraction of approximately 10% with clean coronaries by recent cardiac catheterization, recently discharged from the Cardiology Service following admission with decompensated congestive heart failure who now returns on [**7-6**] with cardiogenic shock.
The patient described a four to five day history of worsening fatigue, dyspnea on exertion and increasing chest pain.
On presentation to the outside hospital on [**Hospital3 **] the patient was hypotensive and tachycardic complaining of 10 out of 10 chest pain.
Electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block, which was old.
Laboratory studies were notable for worsening creatinine, hyperkalemia and acidosis.
He was treated for a question of an acute coronary syndrome at the outside hospital with a heparin drip, Plavix and intravenous Lopressor.
On admission the patient was tachycardic and hypotensive again complaining of chest pain.
He had minimal urine output throughout the day.
He was noted to be hyperkalemic to 7.0 and acidotic consistent with a metabolic acidosis.
His liver function tests and CKs were elevated consistent with multi-organ failure in the setting of shock.
The patient was given Kayexalate bicarbonate, insulin and calcium gluconate for hyperkalemia.
The following morning the patient did receive one unit of fresh frozen platelets and was taken urgently to the catheterization laboratory where a PA catheter was placed revealing elevated biventricular pressures, clean coronary arteries and a depressed cardiac index consistent with severe cardiogenic shock.
The patient subsequently experienced asystolic arrest on the floor from which he was revived with medications and transcutaneous pacing.
