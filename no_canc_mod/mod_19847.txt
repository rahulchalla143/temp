Admission Date: [**2103-11-10**]        Discharge Date: [**2103-11-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2103-11-9**]        Sex:  M  Service:  NB  IDENTIFICATION:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 10 day old former 36 5/7 weeks gestation infant with prenatal diagnosis of cystic hygroma who is being discharged from the [**Hospital1 18**] NICU.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname **] delivered at 36 and 5/7 weeks gestation and was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit from the newborn nursery on day of life one because of episodes of duskiness with feedings.
A cystic hygroma was noted on an early ultrasound that     decreased in size on follow-up ultrasounds.
At 19 weeks, an ultrasound showed a left hydrothorax with     resolution on the 23 week fetal ultrasound.
He was noted to have several episodes of duskiness with feedings and to have some dysmorphic features that prompted admission to the NICU for further assessment.
Right ear low set posteriorly rotated with over folded helix and dysplastic lobe.
Pectus excavatum apparent.
Abdomen: Soft, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly, no masses.
The son[**Name (NI) 493**] examination of the thickened nuchal tissues showed normal appearing subcutaneous tissue.
There were no septations and there was no fluid.
The thickened region lies in the subcutaneous layer, deep to the skin and superior to the strap muscles of the neck.
An echocardiogram was done on [**11-12**] that showed normal anatomy with a PFO, but mild biventricular dysfunction.
A follow-up echocardiogram on [**2103-11-15**] showed again mild ventricular dysfunction without change.
Also noted during admission were frequent premature ventricular beats (PVCs) confirmed by EKG and reviewed by cardiology.
Screen for hemolysis was negative (see below).
Neurology: Infant has been noted to have a high-pitched cry, but otherwise neurologic exam has been appropriate.
Mild dysmorphisms were noted, and [**Doctor Last Name **] Syndrome was questioned, although this was considered less likely given normal structure on ECHO.
Immunizations recommended: Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the following four criteria:  (1) Born at less than 32 weeks; (2) Born between 32 weeks and 35 weeks with two of the following:  Day care during RSV season, a smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or school age siblings; (3) chronic lung disease or (4) hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.
Before this age, and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
Dysmorphic features with possible [**Doctor Last Name **] syndrome.
Mild biventricular dysfunction.
Sepsis ruled out.
