No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
CXR ([**2106-4-16**]) - Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.
Calcification seen along the left lateral ventricular border on the PA view and anteriorly on the lateral view might be consistent with left ventricular aneurysm.
The pacemaker defibrillator inserted terminates at the expected location of the right ventricle.
There is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated with apical aneurysm and severe global hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-3-24**], right ventricular cavity enlargement and free wall hypokinesis are now seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is also slightly higher.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE inhibotor or [**Last Name (un) **].
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
CT Head ([**2106-4-12**]) - IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial pathology.
Mucosal thickening with fluid level in sphenoid sinus on left.
No acute hemorrhage or infarction.
Nonspecific punctate foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity within the periventricular and deep subcortical white matter, which can be seen in patients with microangiopathic small vessel disease.
Pansinus disease as described above, the activity of which is to be determined clinically.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 y/o M ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 15%, now s/p VT/VF arrest transferred with cardiogenic shock.
The patient had relatively flat biomarkers and no evidence of new ischemia.
He required minimal respiratory support and was extubated on [**4-11**] without complication.
The nitroglycerine drip was weaned off, considering an ischemic process was less likely.
While the patient did have a positive troponin, his CK's were negative.
# Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15%.
Echo was performed and showed severely dilated LV with apical aneurysm and severe global hypokinesis and new dilation with free wall hypokinesis in the RV (see above for full report).
However, there was no thrombus seen on repeat echo's.
# Altered Mental Status: Once extubated and weaned off of sedation, the patient was noted to have some depressed mental status.
CT head did not show any acute process.
MRI head showed findings consistent with microangiopathic small vessel disease and alchoholism (see above for complete report).
He was seen by neurology, who felt that his symptoms were common in the post-arrest period.
They also recommended continued anticoagulation for stroke prophylaxis in setting of low ejection fraction.
# Elevated LFT's: Likely shock liver in the setting of his cardiac arrest.
# Acute Renal Failure: Likely ATN in the setting of his cardiac arrest.

Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) tablet Sublingual every 5 minutes for total of 3 doses as needed for chest pain.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check INR on Monday [**4-19**] and call results to [**Hospital 191**] [**Hospital3 **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2173**]   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 2255**] [**Name (NI) 2256**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Ventricular Fibrillation Acute on chronic Systolic dysfunction Anoxic Brain damage.
Coronary Artery Disease Acute Renal Failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You had a cardiac arrest that was due to an abnormal rhythm.
You were brought to [**Hospital1 18**] for treatment and was started on amiodarone to prevent abnormal rhythms.
No lifting your left arm over your head or lift more than 5 pounds for 6 weeks.
Start taking Amiodarone to prevent abnormal rhythms.
Take Clindamycin four times a day for 2 days to prevent an infection at the pacemaker site.
