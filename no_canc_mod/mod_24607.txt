Admission Date:  [**2110-1-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2110-1-12**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1899**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 86602**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with a PMHx s/f Afib, bladder cancer, perioperative MI, glaucoma, and hypertension who presented to BIDN with chest pain on the morning of [**2110-1-10**].
Catheterization showed total occlusion of the RCA with collaterals; there was minimal disease elsewhere.
Review of systems is positive for shortness of breath with stair climbing, daily cough and rhinorrhea, as well as daily palpitations.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, or presyncope.
He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: Hypertension 2.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - MI in [**2106**] - Afib 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Glaucoma - Bladder Cancer   Social History: Lives in [**Location **] with his wife, they are independent in ADLS/IADLS.
- Mother died in 40s of unknown cause - No known early cardiac demise.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
NECK: Supple with JVD at mid-neck at 20 degrees.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal inferior and apical hypokinesis (distal LAD territory).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w distal LAD disease.
Aortic valve sclerosis without stenosis.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
CXR [**1-11**]: FINDINGS: There are no old films available for comparison.
The aorta is minimally tortuous.
There are some aortic calcifications.
There is a small amount of volume loss at both bases and minimal blunting of the CP angles.
There are degenerative changes of the spine with anterior osteophytes, disc space narrowing, and sclerosis.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Mr. [**Known lastname 86602**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with PMHx s/f CAD, AFib, and prior bladder cancer who presents with VT following a STEMI.
No intervenable lesion on cath.
No distal sites for re-anastomosis and patient's age make him a poor candidate for CABG.
TTE showed mild regional LV systolic dysfunction, c/w distal LAD disease, aortic valve sclerosis without stenosis and mild pulmonary HTN.
# RHYTHM:  Pt has history of CAD and prior perioperative NSTEMI by report.
Given that "indigestion" symptoms pre-dated his palpitations, it is likely that his STEMI led to a focal area of arrythmia.
Also, the fact that his VT was quite regular is somewhat indicative of a focal source as opposed to prior scar.
Given baseline symptoms of palpitations, chronic intermittent VT caused by myocardial scarring from prior MI may have been occurring.
Oyster Shell Calcium  Oral   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: ST elevation myocardial infarction, Coronary artery disease, ventricular tachycardia  Seconary: Hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, glaucoma   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
This was secondary to a heart attack you suffered.
Followup Instructions: You will need to follow up with Dr.[**Name (NI) 86603**] office on Tuesday [**2110-1-14**] to have your INR checked.
