# Afib with [**Name (NI) 5509**] - Pt presented with palpitations and DOE similar to episode of afib with [**Name (NI) **] in [**2105**].
Pt now presents with Afib with [**Year (4 digits) **] and clinical evidence of volume overload (bilateral crackles, elevated jvp).
HR still not optimally controlled despite increased flecanide and metoprolol doses and patient continued having episodes of palpitations and tachycardia.
The episode of hypotension (sbp in 80s, with MAP of 60s) was attributed to the response to medications given while on the medical floor as well as in the procedure suite.
# DOE: On admission pt had clinical evidence of volume overload, likely due to poor forward flow from Afib.
In the CCU he denied any SOB and was satting well on room air.
He had some sleep apnea at night but continued to sat above 90% on room air.
# HTN: Blood pressure well controlled during hospital stay off Lisinopril and Imdur.
# Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency: pt with baseline 1.1-1.5.
[**Last Name (un) **] possibly due to poor forward flow from Afib with [**Last Name (un) 5509**] as well as IV diuresis.
