Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2153-2-15**]  10:12:38 AM   Sinus rhythm with frequent premature atrial contractions.
Possible prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Anterior T wave inversions.
Non-specific lateral T wave changes.
Rule out anterior myocardial ischemia.
Compared to tracing #1 anterior T wave inversions are prominent.
Bilateral hilar enlargement and increase in interstitial markings are consistent with mild volume overload although no overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated.
These findings might also represent infection such as viral or atypical bacterial such as mycoplasma.
No appreciable pleural effusion is demonstrated.
IMPRESSION:  Described finding consistent with either mild volume overload or pulmonary infection such as viral or atypical bacterial.
There is no overt CHF.
Blunting at the right CP angle, likely related to small pleural effusions seen better on the CT abdomen and pelvis performed subsequently.
There is coarsening of interstitial markings along the periphery of both lungs, which is compatible with patient's known interstitial lung disease, also better assessed on corresponding CT abdomen and pelvis images.
Atherosclerotic calcification along the aortic knob is noted.
There is no pneumothorax.
No displaced rib fractures are seen.
Degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic and visualized portions of the lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly, small right pleural effusion, without evidence of CHF or pneumonia.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: No comparison studies.
No intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, or major vascular territorial infarct is apparent.
There is moderate prominence of sulci and ventricular system consistent with age-appropriate central atrophy.
There is an air-fluid level in the right maxillary sinus with associated mucosal thickening.
There is hypertrophy of the left maxillary sinus with evidence of prior sinus surgery.
There is mild mucosal thickening of the ethmoid cells and right frontal sinus.
No acute fractures are identified.
There are marked degenerative changes at the atlantodental interval.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
Air-fluid level in the right maxillary sinus, which could indicate acute sinusitis in the right clinical setting.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis were acquired without intravenous or oral contrast material and displayed with 5-mm slice thickness.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a small right-sided pleural effusion.
There are abnormally increased interstitial markings in the visualized portions of the lung bases, indicating interstitial lung disease.
There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.
There is a 2.9 x 1.9 cm hypoattenuating lesion in the left lobe of the liver, incompletely characterized on this non-contrast study.
There is an umbilical [**Doctor Last Name **] hernia without evidence of obstruction.
There is a 2.6 x 2.1 cm lesion in the body of the pancreas measuring fluid density.
There is no ascites.
There are marked atherosclerotic calcifications of the abdominal aorta and its major tributaries.
There are multiple phleboliths.
There is no free fluid.
BONE WINDOWS: There are degenerative changes throughout the visualized portions of thoracic spine and the lumbar spine with bridging anterior osteophytes at multiple levels.
There are central depressions of the superior endplates of L1 and L3, chronic in appearance.
There also is marked facet arthropathy of the lumbar spine.
No acute fractures are identified.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Small right-sided pleural effusion.
Interstitial lung disease.
A 3 cm hypoattenuating lesion in the left lobe of the liver, incompletely characterized on this non-contrast study.
A 2.6 x 2.1 cm cystic lesion in the body of the pancreas, incompletely characterized.
Innumerable bilateral renal cysts.
Abdominal hernia containing non-obstructed small bowel.
Severe degenerative changes in the lumbar spine as described.
Brief Hospital Course: Despite code stroke being called, no signs of acute CVA noted on CT head.
It was likley delirium cause by acute renal failure (poor po intake) and pneumonia (atypical).
Hypoxia resolved.
Patient was afebrile prior to discharge.
IVF were initially given for renal failure that resolved.
Acute renal failure - resolved with hydration.
Sinusitis, likely viral (maxillary) - no symptoms neted.
Delirium - resolved History of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease  as per discussion with PCP and son  [**Name9 (PRE) **] - it is possible that patient may need long term car eplacement after rehab if she is unable to return to her [**Hospital3 **].
