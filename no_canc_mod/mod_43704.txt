Family History: Mother died of stomach cancer in her 40s.
Father had an unknown cancer in his 70s.
She is known to have have multiple access issues/failures and an attempt was being made to place an AVG in her left arm as the right arm has been deemed unusable for dialysis access.
She was taken to the OR by Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**] who placed a left upper arm graft initially without complication.
In the immediate post op period while in the PACU, the team was called to assess the patients left arm  due to swelling and obvious discomfort.
She remained in the PACU overnight and experienced hypotension for which she was started on pressors.
She complained of back pain, but never chest arm or jaw pain.
An echo was obtained showed hyperdynamic ventricles with no specific wall motion abnormalities.
In addition cardiology did not feel a cardiac cath was indicated as she was a poor candidate due to her co-morbidities.
She did continue to have some degree of low BPs intermittently while in hemodialysis.
Vascular was consulted for concern about right leg lower extremity edema, compartment syndrome vs fluid overload.
It was deemed low suspicion for compartment syndrome as the calf was soft and pulses dopplerable.Blood pressures returned to more normal readings (SBP in 110s) Heparin drip d/c'd after 48 hours.
Doxycycline 100mg PO BID and rifampin 300mg PO bid are to be continued  for chronic suppression of MRSA vertebral osteomyelitis (hardware in place) for indefinite period of time.
