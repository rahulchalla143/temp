He was doing well until in [**Month (only) 216**] he had a fall at home after "a few beers."
Since the fall, he had been bed ridden and unable to get up without maximal assistance secondary to pain in his right hip (which they later found out had multiple fractures).
No associated tongue biting/incontinence.
Since that admission, he has been home but unable to walk around without assistance.
He was unresponsive, said "I'm crazy," and then became unresponsive again.
No tongue biting, no urinary incont.
Notably, had leukocytosis with WBC 15 as well as chest x-ray consistent with pneumonia.

He had contiuous PLEDS over the Right frontotemporal area.
The PLEDs may be arising from a recent infarct but given the fact that the patient had a pacer an MRI could not be obtained.
Once the patient was off of propofol he had two electrographic seizures so Dilantin was added with a 1 gram load.
Overnight he became agitated and tore off his EEG leads.
He was started on Trileptal 300 [**Hospital1 **] instead, but patient had another seizure on the floor so patient was loaded with fosphenytoin and dilantin was restarted and trileptal stopped.
His EEG initially showed intermittent R-sided PLEDs.
His EEG improved and showed fewer and less severe discharges than before.
He got up from a chair without calling for assistance and was seen to fall down slowly in the hallway while leaning on a walker.
A head CT showed no acute injury, wrist and hip x-rays showed no fractures.
He had a superficial abrasion on his R wrist.
The most recent one by history sounds rather atypical but considering the EEG evidence it is likely that there is an underlying seizure disorder beyond ETOH with drawal.
The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was not anticoagulated.
He also had a chest xray that was concerning for pneumonia so he was started on cefepime and vancomycin.
This was stopped after 2 days because the patient's chest xray improved after diuresis and he had no further white count or fever.
ENDO: Patient has a history of adrenal insufficiency.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
No focal neurologic weakness, has weakness from prior R hip surgery.
You have been started on antiepileptic medications to prevent future seizures.
You had several seizures while in the hospital.
Your EEG showed abnormal brain activity indicating a high likelihood of further seizures.
The cause of your seizures is possibly an underlying brain injury or abnormality.
You were placed on phenytoin and levetiracetam for seizure control.
Your levetiracetam dose was raised to the maximum for better seizure control, but had to be lowered and then stopped because of worsening irritability.
You attempted to walk unassisted and had a fall, possibly due to a seizure.
You did not have any serious injuries but you should always have assistance when you walk.
