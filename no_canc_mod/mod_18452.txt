History of Present Illness: 58 yo with PMH of hypothyroidism, HTN, TBI, depression, seizure disorder and hx of DVT who was found down in his nursing home while undergoing a GTC.
There is no description of the episode.
Once at [**Hospital1 18**], he had a third event witnessed by the ED team.
Past Medical History: Hypothyroidism HTN TBI Seizure disorder Hx of DVT in [**2155**] - on Coumadin  Social History: Lives at [**Doctor Last Name **] house.
No history of smoking, remote history of social EtOH use, no illicits  Family History: No family history of seizure disorder  Physical Exam: On vent, CMV: PIP 15, PEEP 5, over-breathing vent (20 RR).
HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa Neck: supple, no carotid or vertebral bruit Back: No point tenderness or erythema CV: Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Abd: Soft, nontender, non-distended.
No masses or megalies.
Ext: no edema, no DVT data.
No gaze deviation.
No bobbing or Robbing.
Motor: withdraws to pain in any limb.
Craniotomy hardware causes streak artifact projecting over the cortex of the underlying left temporal and parietal lobes.
Foci of high density in this region are felt to be due to streak artifact rather than acute hemorrhage.
No evidence of hemorrhage is seen.
There are encephalomalacic changes in the right frontal and right temporal lobes, probably due to the reported history of prior trauma.
There is also ex vacuo dilatation of the ventricles as well as evidence of global parenchymal atrophy.
No evidence of infarction is seen, nor shift of normally midline structures or effacement of the basilar cisterns.
Vascular calcifications are noted along the carotid siphon.
The soft tissues, globes, and skull show no definite acute traumatic injury.
Also there is mucosal thickening within the anterior ethmoid air cells and maxillary sinuses bilaterally.
History of left temporoparietal craniotomy, with associated streak artifact.
Allowing for this, no hemorrhage is seen.
Evidence of prior insult, manifest as encephalomalacic change in the right frontal and temporal lobes.
Mild-to-moderate global atrophy.
The patient was initially given Ativan for his seizures, intubated for airway protection, and loaded with depakote (reportedly has a history of Dilantin allergy, although unclear what the reaction is).
The following morning, when further information was available, he was restarted on his home regimen of Keppra, Depakote and Tegretol (unfortunately it was not possible to add those levels on to his initial set of labs drawn in the ED).
The reason for his breakthrough seizures is unclear at this time.
Head CT showed chronic encephalomalacia from his old TBI, and EEG showed Abnormal portable EEG due to the low voltage and occasionally slow background with a more uniform beta rhythm earlier in the tracing.
A slow background suggests a widespread encephalopathy.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
The higher sharper rhythm in the left frontal area raises the possibility of a local skull defect.
There were no clearly epileptiform features.
On admission, as the patient was altered and had an elevated INR, so could not immediately undergo a lumbar puncture, he was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin and acyclovir as prophylaxis.
The patient reportedly has been on Coumadin in the past for a history of a DVT that occurred in the context of the hospitalization for his prior TBI.
Left lower extremity slightly weaker than right.
The seizures may have occured due to a slightly low valproate level, so we increased your valproate dosage to 500 mg three times daily.
Otherwise, you were observed overnight and noted to have had no seizures.
Take all medications as directed, including increased depakote dosing.
If you experience new or worsening symptoms, please contact your neurologist or primary care physician or if emergent, come directly to the emergency room.
