Patient has a history of transient ischemic attack in the past that subsequently showed bilateral carotid stenosis of 40%.
Since then, the patient has had two episodes of visual changes in the left eye that patient described as "blind being drawn over the eye" that was consistent with amaurosis fugax, as well as symptoms of postural dizziness.
The patient underwent carotid duplex study on [**2143-6-25**] which showed 80% stenosis of left internal carotid artery and 40% stenosis of right internal carotid artery.
Coronary artery disease.
RCA was 30% mid stenosis and distal RCA and obtuse marginal stents patent.
Emphysema by pulmonary function tests on [**5-25**] showing mild obstructive pattern of gas trapping.
Peripheral vascular disease, bilateral carotid stenosis.
Transient ischemic attack.
Hernia repair.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No known allergies to shellfish or dye.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease.
[**Name (NI) **] brother died at the age of 58 of myocardial infarction.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive for smoking.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure of 170/78, pulse of 54, respirations 21, O2 saturation of 93% on room air.
Physical examination showed a nice gentleman in no apparent distress.
Patient's visual field examination was significant for left visual field cut on his left eye.
Ophthalmoscopic examination nondilated eyes revealed no gross abnormalities.
Neck: There was a right carotid bruit, no jugular venous distention.
No left carotid bruits were appreciated.
Cardiovascular was regular, rate, and rhythm, normal S1, S2, there were no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended without organomegaly.
Extremities:  There was no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema noted.
Right groin:  There were no bruits or hematomas and normal peripheral pulses.
Patient's initial electrocardiogram was significant for sinus bradycardia with a ventricular of 40-50 beats per minute.
Carotid angiogram:  Left carotid angiogram showed 90% distal occlusion of the common carotid artery and 90% occlusion of internal carotid artery with ulceration, Percusurge wire was used and two stents were placed in ACA and MCA.
Ophthalmic artery was visualized and was patent, but patient did develop blurry vision after the stents were placed.
Over the course of the night, patient did have an episode of asymptomatic bradycardia with heart rate in the 30s to 40s.
Ophthal/Neuro:  Patient had dilated ophthalmologic examination by Ophthalmology service on the day of admission, which did show a cholesterol embolus at one of the branches of retinal artery and edema surrounding it, which was not consistent with ischemia or optic neuropathy, but rather an occlusion of a retinal artery branch with cholesterol embolus.
Over the course of the next day, the patient's usual visual field cut was resolved, and his visual field symptoms were improving, although his vision out of the left eye did remain somewhat blurry.
Neurologic:  Since admission, the patient has been on close neurochecks and exhibited no focal neurologic deficits.
Of note, left visual field changes were addressed as above.
Pulmonary:  History of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Prophylaxis:  SubQ Heparin was administered to the patient while the patient was unable to ambulate being due to status post carotid angiogram.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Carotid artery stenosis status post right carotid artery stent placement.
Patient in the meanwhile is to still continue Alphagan and follow up with an ophthalmologist sooner if visual changes persist and do not improve.
