Mildly dilated aortic arch.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm)  Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 49-year-old woman who was referred by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and a previous stroke.
She was admitted as same day admission for a minimally invasive Maze procedure which consisted of bilateral pulmonary vein isolation using the AtriCure Synergy System with resection of left atrial appendage as well as ganglionic mapping and ablation of positive ganglia as well as a full electrophysiology mapping and testing performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2259**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
Coumadin for started for atrial fibrillation and she was bridged with Heparin drip until her INR was therapeutic.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD 7 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing, pain was controlled with oral analgesics and her INR was therapeutic.
Her Coumadin was to be followed by the [**University/College **] [**Hospital 38299**] [**Hospital 197**] clinic and they were contact[**Name (NI) **] with recent INR and doses.
