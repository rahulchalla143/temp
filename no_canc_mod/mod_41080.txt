Admission Date:  [**2166-3-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-4-1**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 710**] Chief Complaint: Atrial fibrillation with RVR  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: The patient is an 86F with PMH HTN, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism sent from PCP office for evaluation of afib with RVR.
The patient has complained of nonproductive cough and fatigue x 1 week.
The patient presented to her PCP office the day of admission for these symptoms and was found to have new afib with RVR 130s and was sent to the ED for further evaluation.
Initial EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate 170s that resolved without intervention.
She had one epidose of SSCP with cough lasting seconds and resolving without intervention.
ROS: Denied headache, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No melena or BRBPR.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
History of depression 2.
Dementia 3.
Hypothyroidism 4.
Hypertension 6.
Hyperlipidemia 7.
Gait disorder with high falls risk 8.
Status post right humerus fracture 9.
MMM, OP without lesions Neck: Supple, no JVD or carotid bruits appreciated Pulm: Decreased BS bases, good air flow, increased expiratory phase, scattered expiratory wheeze Cardiac: RRR, nl S1/S2, 2/6 systolic diamond-shaped murmur to carotids Abdomen: Soft, NT/ND, + BS, no masses or hepatomegaly noted Ext: No edema b/t, 2+ DP and PT pulses b/l Lymphatics: No cervical, supraclavicular LAD Skin: No rashes or lesions noted.
Radiologic Data: [**2166-3-27**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema and moderate bilateral effusions and atelectasis.
[**2166-3-28**] Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-40 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Mild to moderate ([**12-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: moderately reduced left ventricular contractile function; heavy calcification of mitral annulus and support structures .
MICRO: [**3-27**] BCx: P x 2 [**3-29**] UCx: P  Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 86F with PMH of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism presenting with cough and fatigue, found to be in pAF with new systolic heart failure.
This was the first documented episode of afib for this patient.
There was no e/o acute MI, with negative cardiac enzymes x 2 and no acute ST-T changes consistent with ischemia on EKG.
She remained in NSR during much of her hospital course; however, she did have several recurrent episodes of AF requiring IV medications for rate control.
On [**3-30**], the patient was transferred to the CCU for altered mental status and AF with RVR to 140s despite IV BB and CCB.
Her CHADS2 score was 3; however, after discussion of risks and benefits with the patient and her family they declined anticoagulation given her high fall risk.
CHF:  She was noted to have a new global hypokinesis with EF 30-40% on this admission.
As above, there was no e/o acute MI on admission given negative cardiac enzymes and no acute ST-T changes consistent with ischemia on EKG.
She should have a repeat ECHO in [**1-27**] months to reassess with her LVEF.
Chronic renal failure: Likely due to long-standing HTN.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 1036**] - [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Atrial Fibrillation Secondary Congestive Heart Failure Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with fatigue and cough.
You were noted to have a new atrial fibrillation (an abnormal heart rhythm).
You were also found to have heart failure.
If you have any of the following symptoms you should return to the emergency room or see your PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) **], chest pain, shortess of breath, fever, chills or any other serious concerns.
