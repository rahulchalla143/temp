Her other symptoms included constipation over past week, which then became diarrhea after taking laxative at home two days ago.
She denies melena or hematochezia.
She reports subjective fevers and chills at home, and believes she may have had a fever to as high as 102. .
Her exam was notable for epigastric and left sided abdominal tenderness, but without guarding or rebound tenderness.
She was tachycardic and tremulous, and they were unable to determine if asterixis was present.
She underwent CT abd/pelvis with contrast, which on prelim read shows minimal pancreatic edema (could be sequela of prior inflammation), no psedocyst, a patent splenic vein, no splenic artery pseudoaneurysm, and fatty liver.

There is no pleural effusion.
The liver demonstrates decreased attenuation, compatible with fatty deposition.
Focal hypodensities at the liver dome, best seen on the coronal views (601B:25, 24), are small to characterize and likely represent cysts orhamartomas.
No new focal hepatic lesion is identified.
There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There is no gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid collection to suggest acute inflammation.
Extensive gallbladder wall edema seen on [**2120-11-26**] exam has resolved.
Pancreas is minimally edematous without peripancreatic fluid collection.
The amount of intra-abdominal fluid layering along the right pararenal space demonstrates near complete resolution since [**2120-11-26**] study.
There is no pseudocyst formation.
No splenic artery pseudoaneurysm formation is noted.
Kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without evidence of hydronephrosis or renal masses.
The small and large bowel loops are normal in caliber without evidence of bowel wall thickening or obstruction.
Focal area of fat stranding in the left lower abdomen (2:24, 601B:26) at the site of prior epiploic appendagitis is less conspicuous today from [**2120-10-26**] exam.
There is no free air or free fluid within the abdomen.
There are multiple scattered mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes which do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
The uterus, rectum and sigmoid colon appear unremarkable.
There is no free air or free fluid within the pelvis.
No pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes are seen.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is seen.
Mildly edematous pancreas, may represent sequela of prior pancreatitis.
Intra-abdominal fluid related to prior episode of acute pancreatitis seen on [**2120-11-26**] exam has resolved.
There is no evidence of pseudocyst formation.
There is no splenic artery pseudoaneurysm formation  2.
Extensive gallbladder wall edema seen on [**2120-11-26**] exam has resolved.
Fatty deposition of the liver with subtle focal hypodensities, too small to characterize, which likely represent cysts or hamartomas.
ate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	P	QRS	T 105	114	84	370/448	78	68	70   Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION: ==================================== Ms. [**Known lastname 1887**] is a 30 year old female with a history of EtOH dependence, EtOH hepatitis, pancreatitis, and gastritis who presented with vomiting and abdominal pain.
ACTIVE ISSUES: =============== #)Abdominal Pain: It appears that the main factor causing the pain was alcoholic gastritis which she has had in the past.
The pain improved with a PPI and therefore she was discharged on omeprazole.
Initially there was concern for pancreatitis, however her lipase was normal and her CT was not strongly suggestive of acute pancreatitis.
She also had ketones in her urine on presentation which was likely from alcoholic or starvation ketoacidosis.
Ketoacidosis likely exacerbated her abdominal pain and nausea as well.
Patient described having DTs at home, but she did not have any during this admission.
She does endorse a history of anorexia at around age 12 (no hospitalizations).
Pt denies h/o eating d/o in college (in contrast to note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 63729**] [**Name (STitle) 12885**] dated [**2118-12-2**]).
Denies any active eating disorder symptoms at present.
Denies ever engaging in purging or bingeing behaviors.
Denies laxative or diuretic abuse.
Patient did not have an unsafe BMI or other indication for involuntary eating disorder treatment.
The patient did have some electrolyte abnormalities associated with refeeding that may be part of her eating disorder or related to her alcoholism including hypokalemia, hypophoshatemia, hypomagenesemia.
However these all corrected and she did not have any concerning arrythmias.
- She will follow-up with her outpatient psychiatric providers .
However she twisted her foot while running down the steps and sustained a right midshaft spiral 5th metatarsal fracture with moderate displacement.
She was evaluated by the orthopedic surgery team who recommended weight bearing as tolerated in post-op shoe.
This was probably not the primary process leading to the patient's abdominal pain or presentation to the hospital .
Likely related to profound intra-vascular volume depletion.
No fevers or leukocytosis to suggest infection.
Normalized with fluid resuscitation.
# Depression: - continued home prozac .
Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 1887**],  You were admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain and alcohol withdrawal.
Your pain was probably caused by inflammation of your stomach lining from alcohol use.
While treating your withdrawal, we were concerned that you had very low potassium, sodium, and magnesium.
You were found to have a broken right foot.
