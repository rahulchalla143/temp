Admission Date:  [**2108-11-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-11-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2064-11-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**] Chief Complaint: Elevated cardiac enzymes suggestive of an NSTEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization   History of Present Illness: Dr. [**Known lastname 1140**] is a 43 year-old man with a history of GERD who presents with pleuritic pain and elevated troponin.
On [**10-9**], he noted a "warm" feeling in his chest which lasted seconds; there may have been some associated nausea but no SOB or overt CP.
Approximately 1.5 weeks prior to admission, he began also feeling abdominal pain and occasional sensations that something was getting stuck in his throat.
Two days later he spoke with a gastroenterologist and was told he may have eosinophilic esophagitis.
Over the last couple days he has experienced right lower pleuritic chest pain.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
He reports frequent "gas" and recent low back pain with radiation down the right leg, improved of late.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: (-) Diabetes (-) Dyslipidemia (-) Hypertension  2.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - GERD - Exercise induced asthma - Psoriasis - s/p tonsillectomy, bilateral hernia repair - Colonoscopy at age 40; normal  Social History: -Anesthesiologist at [**Hospital3 3583**] -Tobacco history: None.
No history of early CAD.
Physical Exam: VS: T=  BP=113/53   HR=67   RR=12   O2 sat=97% RA GENERAL: Lying in bed, mildly groggy after receiving morphine.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
No ST-T changes.
No radiographic evidence of pneumonia or acute CHF.
Minimal scarring or atelectasis in the left lung base.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system  revealed no angiographically apparent flow limiting epicardial coronary artery disease of the LMCA, LAD, LCx, or RCA.
Resting hemodynamics revealed no evidence of systemic arterial systolic or diastolic hypertension.
There was no transvalvular gradient upon pullback of the catheter from the left ventricle to the aorta.
Brief Hospital Course: 43F with no prior cardiac history presenting with vague esophageal symptoms and a slightly positive troponins.
# Positive cardiac enzymes:  The patient ruled-in by troponin at the OSH and continued to have slightly elevated troponins of 0.11 here; no ECG changes noted.
He was transferred here to undergo cardiac catheterization which showed no angiographically apparent flow limiting epicardial coronary artery disease of the LMCA, LAD, LCx, or RCA.
The slightly positive troponins are unlikely to represent cardiac ischemia given his clean coronary arteries on cath.
He does not have LVH or kidney disease which are other reasons why he could have slightly elevated trops.
After his cath showed no CAD the ASA, plavix, and heparin gtt he had been transferred on were stopped.
No pathologic valvular abnormality was seen.
# DYSPHAGIA/GERD:  The patient describes symptoms which seems to be related to GERD and possibly of esophageal origin.
# EOSINOPHILIA:  Mild with absoluate count of ~1000.
[**Month (only) 116**] be related to possible eosinophilic esophagitis given his GI symptoms.
)(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Chest Pain Secondary Diagnosis: Gastroesophageal Reflux   Discharge Condition: Stable, chest pain free   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for chest discomfort.
Based on your elevated cardiac lab tests, we felt that you likely may have had a small heart attack.
You had a cardiac catheterization which did not show any significant disease in your heart vessels.
No intervention was done.
If you develop any of the following concerning symptoms, please call your PCP or go to the ED: worsening chest pains, shortness of breath, bleeding from the groin site, numbness or tingling in the legs.
