He is a right handed man who began feeling neck pain two to three days prior to admission.
When he stood up, he had sudden onset of severe neck pain shooting up into his occiput.
The neck pain was severe enough on the left side and moved to the right side prompting him to come to the Emergency Department.
He denied photophobia, nausea, vomiting, ever having had neck pain of that severity in the past.
ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.
He had no pronator drift noted.
There was some enlargement of the temporal horns.
The angiogram was negative for any evidence of cerebral aneurysm or cerebral basal dissection.
The patient's Intensive Care Unit course remained relatively unremarkable until [**2198-12-1**], at which time he complained of a little bit of increased headache.
There was no change in his general neurologic examination, however.
The patient was started on low amount of steroids just to help with generalized brain edema and pain.
He was maintained on regular diet and there were no significant changes in his neurologic examination throughout the remainder of the days from [**2198-12-4**], to [**2198-12-7**].
On [**2198-12-7**], it was decided to repeat the patient's angiogram to again examine the patient's cerebral circulation for evidence of aneurysm.
Following this angiogram on the night of [**2198-12-7**], to [**2198-12-8**], the patient complained of significant increase in his headache.
Neurologic examination at that time demonstrated the patient was alert and oriented with reactive pupils, no drift, with normal lower extremity strength, no evidence of groin hematoma.
The CT demonstrated a small amount of residual subarachnoid blood along the tentorium.
However, there was no change in ventricular size and no evidence of mass effect or shift.
On [**2198-12-9**], with the patient tolerating p.o., his headache resolved and no longer vomiting and tolerating a p.o.
Grade I subarachnoid hemorrhage, status post cerebral angiogram times two negative for any evidence of intracerebral aneurysm.
