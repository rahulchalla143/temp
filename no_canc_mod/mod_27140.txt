She became tachypnic to the 40s and was placed on BiPAP with good effect -> ABG 7.40/42/120.
The patient developed a rash thought to be secondary to hypersensitivity to the cleaning products used; it is improving despite continuing the above antibiotics.
The patient developed leukocytosis thought secondary to steroids.
The patient had sinus tachycardia thought secondary to albuterol which was improved prior to transfer.

There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement.

Hypoxia: Most likely represented a COPD exacerbation, likely due to community-acquired pneumonia.
The patient was afebrile but had mild leukocytosis and complained of a productive cough.
The patient had no evidence of congestive heart failure on physical examination or imaging; the patient does not have an echocardiogram in our system.
CTA was negative for pulmonary embolus on admission.
The patient was initially maintained on BiPAP but her oxygen requirement quickly improved.
The patient was given steroids, initially intravenously, then changed to oral for a slow taper.
The patient was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for community-acquired pneumonia and changed to levofloxacin prior to discharge to complete a ten day course.
Tachycardia: The patient had sinus tachycardia to heart rate 120s during admission.
This was likely due to albuterol.
The tachycardia improved with the change of albuterol to xopenex nebulizers as needed.
Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count was 13.1 on admission, likely due to the patient's pneumonia as above.
The white blood cell count increased to 22-24 after initiation of steroids, likely secondary to demarginalization of white blood cells.
Urinalysis was negative for infection.
Rash: The patient developed a rash during admission, initially an erythematous macular pruritic rash on the trunk and flanks.
The patient was ambulating without difficulty.
