Admission Date:  [**2150-1-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-1-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2074-4-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Atorvastatin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: central venous line (subclavian) intubation  History of Present Illness: 75 yo female with PmHx of DM, asthma, HTN, hyperlipidemia who presented from her [**Hospital3 **] home [**1-17**] with respiratory distress.
She was noted to be bradycardic, with a ?junctional escape rhythm at a rate of 48 bpm in the setting of hyperkalemia (K=7), and was given atropine.
However, she subsequently became hypotensive, was started on dopamine, and was electively intubated.
Of note, several medications were apparently changed [**1-13**] by her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 19566**] initiation of Cardtia XT 300mg daily, with discontinuation of nifedipine.
Micu course notable for resolution of her hyperkalemia, which was thought to be secondary to a combination acute on chronic renal failure and [**Last Name (un) **] toxicity, with resolution of normal sinus rhythm (rate in the 70s), and pressors were waned off on hospital day one.
She was successfully extubated [**1-20**], though required intermittent noninvasive ventilation for hypercarbia thought to be secondary to combination of sedative medications and poor baseline respiratory status.
She also was noted to be febrile, and was treated empirically for possible MRSA pneumonia (sputum cultures positive for MRSA), with defervescence on [**1-17**].
Furthermore, discussion with outpatient psychiatrist revealed that patient has atypical reaction (extreme agitation/?psychosis) to midazolam, which may have contributed to her altered mental status during weaning period.
She was also noted to have hypernatremia, which was thought to be secondary to crystalloid given during initial fluid resuscitation in the setting of acute renal insufficiency.
Her hypernatremia improved with free water repletion.
?hepatic cyst, S/p right total knee replacement ([**2147**]).
DM II, c/b neuropathy and nephropathy.
Gen: patient seated in the nursing area in [**Female First Name (un) 1634**] chair, NAD, awake&alert, nad CV: RRR nl S1 S2, no M/R/G appreciated Pulm: scattered expiratory rhonchi throughout Abd: obese, protruberant, NT, +BS EXT: No edema CV: 2+ PT, DP pulses bilaterally Neuro: Awake, alert, oriented to person and place   Brief Hospital Course: MICU course:  * BRADYCARDIA/HYPOTENSION: Bradycardia was thought to be secondary to either junctional rhythm vs. hyperkalemic arrhythmia, as potassium was >7 on admission.
Hyperkalemia was thought to be secondary to a combination acute on chronic renal failure and [**Last Name (un) **] toxicity.
However, patient was not extubated until hospital day 3, as patient was noted to be extremely agitated during spontaneous breathing trials despite excellent objective indications of successful extubation (low RSBI, appropriate respiratory rates and tidal volumes).
Nonetheless, patient was successfully extubated, but required intermittent noninvasive ventilation for hypercarbia thought to be secondary to combination of sedative medications and baseline COPD.
Discussion with outpatient psychiatrist revealed that patient has atypical reaction (extreme agitation/?psychosis) to midazolam, which may have explained patient's mental status during weaning period.
* BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA: Given above difficulty with extubation and intermittent fevers, sputum gram stain and cultures were sent, and patient was found to have MRSA pneumonia.
Prior to microbiological data, patient was empirically started on levofloxacin and metronidazole, but vancomycin was added following identification of Staphylococcus aureus in sputum culture [**1-17**].
Patient was afebrile by third day of treatment, with low grade temperature elevations.
* BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER: According to outpatient psychiatrist, patient is easily agitated at baseline and is best managed by a combination of quetiapine, valproic acid, and oxazepam PRN.
Following medical stabilization, patient was restarted on quetiapine and valproic acid with PRN lorazepam for acute bouts of agitation.
* HYPERNATREMIA: Thought to be due to large sodium load during initial fluid resuscitation in the setting of acute renal insufficiency.
* ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  On admission, patient's creatinine was 2.7, thought to be secondary to hypoperfusion during bradycardic episode.
* PSYCH/AGITATION: She experienced some agitation and getting out of bed although she was unsteady on her feet.
She has not experienced any fevers or respiratory difficulty since being called out of the unit and was successfully weaned off of oxygen.
* CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE/HYPERKALEMIA: Her renal function has remained at baseline of 0.8-1.2 on the wards without hyperkalemia.
* HYPOTENSION * She experienced no further hypotension and instead experienced hypertension throughout her course on the floor.
