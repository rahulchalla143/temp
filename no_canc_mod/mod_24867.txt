Acute left MCA territory ischemia with occlusion of left MCA, M1/M2 segment.
No evidence of intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage.
Bibasilar atelectasis with more focal opacity in the left lung base which may represent atelectatic change versus underlying infection.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
TRANSTHORACIC ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
Markedly dilated atria.
CAROTID U/S (PRELIM REPORT) BILATERAL <40% STENOSIS  Brief Hospital Course: NEURO: Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after becoming unresponsive and aphasic at [**Hospital3 **] during an admission for L parietal stroke.
Patient was not given tPA for multiple reasons: - patient had some prefusion of the area of infarction already - minimal neurologic deficit for the occlusion of M1 segment of the MCA - Patient is on Coumadin with high INR - Expected difficulties with passing of microcatheter to the area of artery block, which in circumstances of high INR can result in bleeding Patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Patient was already improving, so likely had a proximal L MCA stroke that broke up on its own and had lodged distally (temporal region), leaving him with only minimal deficits.
Carotids were <40% stenosis bilaterally, and TTE revealed no thrombus or PFO.
Coumadin was became supratherapeutic when given antibiotics so was held for 2 days, then restarted for goal INR 2.5-3.5 given AVR and MVR.
Digoxin level was 0.3, current dose was continued as there was no clinical evidence of toxicity.
RESP: CXR showed bibasilar atelectasis, there was no clinical evidence of PNA.
ID: Patient had been on levaquin for UTI at [**Hospital3 **] which was continued to complete 7 day course.
There was high suspicion for alkaptonuria, especially given history of heart valve disease and repair.
You were admitted after an episode of unresponsivess and difficulty speaking.
You were found to have a stroke on the left side.
