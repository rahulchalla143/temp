Admission Date:  [**2148-2-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2148-2-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2070-11-23**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CCU/[**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old gentleman, a patient of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who was referred with known peripheral vascular disease referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for lower extremity angiography on [**2148-2-19**] who was not able to complete angiography due to severe lower extremity pain.
For the past month, the patient had been experiencing lower extremity pain that extended from his right buttocks to his calf.
He reports that over the last few days he was having symptoms at rest.
He also complains of having pain, tingling, and a "wet/cool feeling" in his right foot and both hands.
CAD with CABG.
Peripheral vascular disease with right ABI of 0.8 and a left lower extremity bypass in [**2141**].
Dry mucous membranes.
No carotid bruits.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  No rash.
No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Back:  No CVA or spinal/paraspinal tenderness to palpation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had a cardiac catheterization and stent the day of admission with the final diagnosis of three vessel coronary artery disease, patent SVG to OM1, patent LIMA to LAD, severe diffuse disease of the right superficial femoral artery, popliteal, and posterior tibial arteries.
The patient was then transferred to the CRSU where he was transferred because he continued to have oxygen requirement.
The patient had been hydrated for renal protection and then became short of breath and was requiring 100% nonrebreather.
The patient was given 20 mg of IV Lasix and the patient was complaining of shortness of breath intermittently.
The patient was transferred to the CCU team for further management of his hypoxia.
It was attributed to pulmonary edema secondary to dye load and postcatheterization fluid.
and had a chest x-ray to rule out any pneumonia.
Again, the patient was further diuresed with Lasix with minimal output and concern for minimal output in light of contrast dye load and the patient's diabetes.
The patient did eventually develop signs of contrast nephropathy and with poor output to Lasix and diuresis the patient continued to have oxygen requirement.
He was tried on BIPAP intermittently overnight and because of discomfort did not tolerate and went back to 100% nonrebreather and then back to BIPAP and eventually was intubated for persistent hypoxia and concern for respiratory fatigue.
The patient had a chest x-ray which showed right-sided effusion and mild edema but no pneumothorax.
The patient was slightly hypotensive initially and his Lasix and Natrecor were held.
His hypoxia was attributed to pulmonary edema with also a superimposed pneumonia versus bronchitis as he continued to have gram-negative rods growing on his sputum which were never speciated.
No evidence of a pneumonia was seen on chest x-ray but the patient was started on a seven day course of ceftazidime and levofloxacin which were started secondary to a temperature spike to 101 in light of being intubated and the gram-negative rods on the sputum.
The patient had an exercise MIBI in [**2147-12-31**] with severe LV enlargement, severe fixed defect in the basilar portion of the inferior wall, severe fixed defect in the mid anterior wall, moderate fixed apical defect, mild partially reversible defect in the basilar portion of the lateral wall, severe global hypokinesis with ejection fraction of 17%.
The RCA was dominant with a 60% ostial lesion that damped on the engagement.
The LIMA angiography showed widely patent conduit to the distal LAD with collateral filling of the distal circumflex and also showed a patent SVG to high OM1, 40% kink was present as the SVG passed into the pericardium.
The patient had severe biventricular hypokinesis on echocardiogram and eventually diuresed as his ATN resolved.
ATN/ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Secondary to contrast nephropathy and poor forward flow with his CHF.
DIABETES:  The patient was on an insulin drip during his course in the CCU and the patient was on tube feeds and on a different insulin regimen and had poorly controlled blood sugars.
PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE:  The patient was status post right SFA stent with better control of his lower extremity pain.
