History of Present Illness: This is a 77 yo F w insulin-dep DM c/b neuropathy and right BKA ([**11-10**]), pA-Fib, GERD now s/p fall with impacted L subcapital femoral neck fracture who is POD1 s/p ORIF.
She was discharged to daughter's home, and patient unfortunately experienced a fall with fracture of her L hip on [**2161-8-4**].
However, while in the ED, she had oxygen desaturation and needed to be placed on BiPAP to keep oxygen elevated.
She denies pleuritic or positional component, and at this time, cough has resolved.
She denies any fevers, chills or weight loss.
Does have pain at this time, but only wants Tylenol for pain control.
- PVD - GERD - paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - h/o gastritis - h/o pancreatitis - h/o stress incontinence, urinary retention - h/o CVA (left occipital infarct) - s/p cervical fusion, lumbar disc surgery - glaucoma - R eye blindness - R BKA  Social History: Living in rehab since [**Month (only) 1096**] until [**8-2**].
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 97.8 BP: 120-141/52-65 P: 58-68 R: 18 O2: 100% (RA) General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress; laying in bed holding L hip HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP difficult to assess Lungs: Bibasilar crackles with poor inspiratory effort CV: Heart sounds difficult to auscultate [**2-3**] body habitus, regular rate and rhythm, no appreciable murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: Obese, soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis; trace edema in LLE, but pulses still present and sensation grossly intact.
Some TTP in L hip and knee, but no effusions, erythema.
CT pelvis w/o contrast, [**2161-8-4**]: IMPRESSION: Left minimally impacted subcapital femoral neck fracture.
Hip XR, [**2161-8-4**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture or subluxation of the left hip.
ECHO, [**2161-8-5**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Small LV cavity size with mild symmetric LVH and hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
Abnormal LVOT systolic flow contour without frank obstruction.
Probable diastolic dysfunction.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Calcified mitral and aortic valve without significant stenosis or regurgitation.
Degree of mitral regurgitation is slightly less (may have been OVERestimated on the prior study).
Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are higher.
CXR, [**2161-8-9**]: IMPRESSION: Limited study demonstrating subsegmental atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: Briefly, this is a 77 yo F w/ insulin-dep DM c/b neuropathy and right BKA ([**11-10**]), pA-Fib, diastolic dysfunction, GERD who presented s/p fall with impacted L subcapital femoral neck fracture who had acute-onset SOB with h/o cough in the ED requiring MICU admission.
# Acute diastolic congestive heart exacerbation: She was initially placed on BiPAP with transition to NC with stable sats in MICU.
Despite elevated d-dimer, the patient and family refused workup for pulmonary embolism.
BNP elevated, but ECHO did not show any acute worsening of cardiac function, and EKGs were without change.
At time of discharge, pt with bibasilar crackles (and bibasilar atelectasis on CXR) but good saturations on RA.
In addition, she was given nebs PRN for wheezing.
Pt declined opioid medications, and pain controlled with scheduled Tylenol and PRN tramadol.
Pt seen and evaluated by PT, and pt to have touch-down weight bearing, per ortho.
# Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus: FSG monitored, and especially in post-op setting, tightly controlled.
# UTI: pt with UA indicative of UTI, and leukocytosis on admission.
# History of atrial fibrillation: She had no episodes of atrial fibrillation during hospitalization.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 23095**] Rehabilitation & Nursing Center - [**Location 8391**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: - Left hip fracture - Acute diastolic heart failure exacerbation  Secondary: - Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 complicated neuropathy and right below knee amputation.
- Peripheral [**Location 1106**] disease - Gastroesophageal reflux disease - Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - History of stress incontinence, urinary retention - History of left occipital infarct - Glaucoma - Right eye blindness   Discharge Condition: Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Your pain has been controlled using Tylenol, as you requested.
You were also noted to have shortness of breath in the emergency room, so you were initially admitted to the medical intensive care unit and had to be temporarily placed on positive-pressure ventilation.
You also had fluid taken out of your lungs using a medication called Lasix.
- We also started colace, senna, and bisacodyl to prevent constipation as well as albuterol as needed for shortness of breath.
