All around this same time he had nausea, intermittent episodes of squeezing chest pain worse with inhalation (lasting about 20 minutes or so), crampy abdominal pain, and nausea.
He states that he had some loose, dark black stools; his stools were guiaic positive but brown in ED.
+ chills, night sweats, no fevers.
In the ED he gave a history of L sided pleuritic CP radiating to neck X 3 days.
Unable to eat due to poor appetite and nausea.
L leg numbness and tingling since Monday without back pain.
He was tachycardic to 106, with some afib noted in the ED but not on EKG; BPs nl, O2 sat 100%.
EKG without ischemic changes, trops negative.
An EKG was negative for any ischemic changes.
Given elevated d-dimer and pt's reported contrast dye allergy, V/Q scan performed that was mod probability for PE (subsegmental V/Q mismatch in superior aspect of b/l upper lobes and posterior basal segment of LLL).
Given the ED's concern for not having a clear explanation for the pt's multiple complaints, and given that some of these complaints might point to acute problems, he was admitted to the ICU for closer monitoring.

Lungs are clear without focal consolidation or pulmonary edema.
There is no pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
V/Q Scan [**12-13**] - Subsegmental perfusion/ventilation mismatch involving the superior segments of both upper lobes and the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe.
Findings represent a moderate probability for pulmonary embolus of undetermined chronicity.
If clinically indicated, further evaluation with lower extremity ultrasound to assess for DVT and a repeat VQ scan in 24-48 hours could be performed.

Chest x-ray shows no areas of consolidation.
The above findings are consistent with a normal study.
Brief Hospital Course: 44 yo M with hepatitis C, hypothyroidism, PAF, depression, anxiety, and h/o past narcotic, benzo, and IVDA who presents to the ED with multiple complaints including L pleuritic chest pain, nausea, possible hematemesis and melena, found to have intermediate probability study for PE on V/Q scan, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close observation overnight.
# L chest pain - Described as pleuritic in nature with elevated d-dimer to 2670 in ED.
V/Q scan with subsegmental V/Q mismatch in superior segments of both upper lobes and in posterior basal segment of LLL.
Bilateral LENIs negative for evidence of DVT.
Otherwise, clinical suspicion for acute PE is relatively low given lack of hypoxia, no EKG changes (S1Q3T3).
Pt is tachycardic, but there are other possible explanations for this including melena, poor po intake, pain, and possible benzo withdrawal.
No evidence of cardiac ischemia on EKG, troponins flat.
CXR without evidence of enlarged mediastinum.
Repeat V/Q low probability/normal study and chest pain resolved spontaneously.
# Leg weakness: Has history of sciatic pain in left leg.
# Acute renal failure: prerenal, resolved with fluids.
# Diabetes mellitus type 2: resumed home dose of metformin with good control.
# Transaminitis: Elevated liver enzymes along with elevated CK, ALT is at a peak relative.
Combination of transaminitis with elevated CK could be concerning for toxic or medication effect, might be statin effect.
He was discharged to the street with options for homeless shelters.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: 1. esophagitis with GI bleeding 2. depression 3. knee pain, NOS   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Please return to the hospital if you have chest pain, shortness of breath, blood in your stool, or any other alarming symptoms.
