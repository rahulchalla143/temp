Ileostomy with pink stoma, bag draining maroon blood, large area of abdominal hernia which was soft and nontender.
Abdominal x-ray showed dilated cecum to about 4 cm and nonspecific bowel gas pattern.
Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates or effusions.
EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 90, right bundle branch block, no Q waves, no ST changes.
The patient had cardiac enzymes cycled which were negative for acute myocardial infarction.
The patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed on [**2196-2-11**] that showed a medium hiatal hernia, erythema and granularity in the lower third of the esophagus and middle third of the esophagus compatible with esophagitis, food in the fundus, erythema and congestion in the stomach, body and antrum compatible with nasogastric tube trauma, otherwise normal esophagogastroduodenoscopy to second part of the duodenum.
The patient also had an ultrasound to evaluate the kidneys, liver and gallbladder, which showed cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis; small granuloma in the liver and two tiny nonobstructing stones in the left kidney.
At that time on examination of the abdomen there was a pink ileostomy with maroon colored output, positive air in the ostomy bag, no tenderness, redness or rebound.
Also the hernia was not reducible, however given the benign examination at the time, there were no recommendations for acute surgical intervention.
The patient was transferred out of the MICU on [**2196-2-12**] with a stable hematocrit and no further bleeding from the ostomy, however on [**2-12**] the patient had a complaint of increased abdominal pain and on reexamination the patient was noted to have a tender abdomen still with a nonreducible hernia, pink stoma, no guarding, and also the patient was noted to be nauseated and vomiting.
At this time another KUB was done which showed interval dilation of loops of small bowel which was consistent with progression of a small bowel obstruction.
