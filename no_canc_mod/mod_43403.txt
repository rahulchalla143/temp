First time seizures - This episode was thought to be focal status, and once stopped she never had a recurrent of seizure-like activity.
It was thought that perhaps her seizure was secondary to severe electrolyte abnormalities in the setting of poor nutrition post operatively.
Further neurologic workup for seizure included LP that was unremarkable and MRI that showed no enhancing lesions, one small area of DWI right thalamus without FLAIR correleate of unclear significance.
Radiology reported diffuse meningeal uptake, but this was likely s/p LP effects.
Encephalopathy - Pt was initially very encephalopathic, thought to be due to infection as well as dilantin toxicity.
As her pneumonia was treated and her dilatnin level was reduced, she became markedly awake and lucid, and by discharge was conversant and easily following commands.
Aspiration pneumonia - She had a LLL infiltrate on CXR, leukocytosis to 13K, low grade temp (98.8 ax), she was started on levofloxacin and flagyl and completed a 10 day course.
On [**1-24**] she had an episode of acute respiratory distress, her CXR and lung exam were consistent with pulmonary edema and she was given IV lasix with excellent response.
Heme: On admission, hct dropped from 36->29, repeat was 32 She does not appear to be iron deficiency or anemia of chronic disease, she does however have borderline low B12 and folate.
FEN: Pt was not PO'ing due to encephalopathy.
She also initially had hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hypokalemia, all of which were stabilized with her [**Month/Year (2) 32813**].
PPx: for stroke ppx, was initially given ASA, but due to decreasing hct and recent surgery, upon transfer the ASA was d/c'ed.
Multivitamin   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2732**] & Retirement Home - [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Partial seizure Pneumonia   Discharge Condition: improved  Discharge Instructions: Please return to ED if pt develops worsening respiratory distress or seizure-like activity.
