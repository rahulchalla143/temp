Admission Date:  [**2192-4-19**]     Discharge Date:  [**2192-5-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2115-8-14**]     Sex:  M  Service:  MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76 year old male recently discharged to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2192-3-13**], after an admission to [**Hospital1 69**] for a pneumonia, rib fracture and moderate right pneumothorax.
The patient developed Clostridium difficile colitis and was treated with Flagyl at [**Hospital1 **].
As part of a work-up, the patient had an x-ray of the abdomen which revealed a distended bladder and a Foley catheter was placed.
The patient subsequently developed significant bleeding around the meatus and came to the Emergency Room for an evaluation.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On review of systems, he noted recent increased fatigue, and was reported feeling feverish.
The patient was given four liters of intravenous fluids and was started on Levophed with an increase in the systolic blood pressure to 90.
Arterial blood gas revealed 7.21/31/51 and the patient was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and uncompensated metabolic acidosis.
Non-Q wave myocardial infarction in 02/[**2192**].
Clostridium difficile colitis in [**2-/2192**], with negative cultures times two.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
A urinalysis with small blood, positive nitrites, protein 30, 21 to 50 white blood cells, many bacteria.
Chest x-ray with florid congestive heart failure.
Poor R wave progression, low voltage.
Respiratory: Bilateral crackles and rhonchi.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate; no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen distended with decreased bowel sounds.
Extremities with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 76 year old male who presents to the Emergency Room with urosepsis after recent Foley catheter manipulation and was intubated for hypoxic respiratory arrest.
The patient developed florid congestive heart failure and subsequent hypoxemia.
The patient's blood cultures subsequently grew Klebsiella pneumonia, resistant to Gentamicin.
The patient developed congestive heart failure in the setting of intravenous fluid resuscitation.
In addition, the patient developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on hospital day number three.
An echocardiogram was obtained which revealed severe global left ventricular hypokinesis and severely depressed left ventricular systolic function.
As the patient's sedation was weaned, mental status did not improve, and head CT scan was obtained which revealed development of a moderate amount of interventricular hemorrhage.
A subsequent MRI revealed fluid levels in the occipital horns of both lateral ventricles and increased signal within the pre-pontine cistern, worrisome for additional focus of subacute subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Interval blood cultures from catheter tip grew Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Neurology felt that the MRI findings were consistent with possible infectious emboli.
Transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained which revealed small mobile echogenic mass on the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve suspicious for vegetation.
A repeat head CT scan and subsequent follow-up head CT scan showed no change in interventricular hemorrhage.
Congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation.
