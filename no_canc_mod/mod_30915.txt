Patient was found to have UTI at chronic care facility and wsa given levaquin x 5 days then macrobid after, but continued to spike 101.
Patient then began to be dyspnic and hypoxic, and pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
In [**Name (NI) **] pt was given solumedrol and neb en route for COPD exacerbation and went to 97% on 4L.
Catatonic schizophrenia.
History of PPD positive.

Question history of aspiration pneumonia.
Social History: DNR/DNI  Physical Exam: T 98.8 BP 116/48 P 70 RR 24 O2 sat 93% Gen: agitated HEENT: Rhytmic movement of lips and tongue, slightly tremulous Lungs: CTA bilaterally Cor: RRR, nl S1, S2, no M/R/G Abd: +BS, soft, NTND, tender LLQ, no rebound/guarding Ext warm, no clubbing/cyanosis/edema Neuro: Resting tremor, stiff, cogwheel rigidity.

There is no evidence of CHF or pneumonia.
There is no pneumothorax.
A healed right humeral neck fracture is noted.
No failure or pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Respiratory failure: Patient was transferred to ICU for NIMV for hypoxia and hypercapnea for presumable COPD exacerbation.
BIPAP was weaned off, however, patient became intermittently somnolent on nasal cannula and had to be put back on BIPAP.
There was a question of obstructive sleep pnea vs restrictive/obstructive lung dz scondarty to kyphosis.
Patient's oxygen saturation was generally maintatined >90% but <95% since pt has COPD and needs hypoxic respiratory drive.
Doxycycline was initially started for possible infectious cause as a trigger.
Patient may benefit from sleep studies to evluate for obstructive sleep apnea.
3) Schizophrenia: Patient with history of catatonic schizophrenia.
COPD 2.
Hypernatremia 3.
Catatonic schizophrenia 4.
Hypothyroidism 5.
