No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
Mild coarctation of distal aortic arch.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated with maximum dimensions of 4.5, the most proximal part of the arch that is seen is 2.5 cm in diameter.
There is a mild coarctation of the distal aortic arch, just distal to take off of the Left subclavian artery narrowing down to 1.7cm briefly before enlarging to 2.4 cm.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No pneumothorax is identified.
The upper left rib resection is again noted.
Some atelectasis and left effusion is now present.
IMPRESSION: Left effusion, no pneumothorax.
