There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
Mild aortic valve stenosis is present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is trivial mitral regurgitaiton.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
CT abd/pelvis [**2121-5-29**]-IMPRESSION: Diffuse ascites and the presence of anasarca suggest third spacing.
Without IV or oral contrast, this examination is limited.
A left lower extremity subcutaneous defect is present but there is no evidence of subcutaneous air in the soft tissues.
It was felt that the hypotension was secondary to sepsis based on exam, with a possible [**Month/Day/Year **] cellulitis as a source.
Blood cultures grew out GNR on HD #1.
She was convered broadly with zosyn and vancomycin as well as flagyl for potential gut sources.
It was thought that her severe right sided heart failure and 4+ TR were leading to a cardiac component to the shock.
Given her extremely grave prognosis, several family meetings were held.
