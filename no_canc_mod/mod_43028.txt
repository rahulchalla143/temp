It doesn't appear that she had tonic- clonic movements.
Family History: father had a question of [**Name (NI) 2481**]  Physical Exam: General appearance: well appearing intubated Heart: regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops Lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen: soft, NT Extremities: no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Skull & Spine: Neck is supple  Mental Status: She follows midline and simple appendicular commands (squeeze hand, close eyes).
There is no verbal output.
No obvious facial droop.
Sensory: withdraws to noxious stimuli  Pertinent Results: [**2113-3-23**] 02:57PM   ALT(SGPT)-114* AST(SGOT)-170* LD(LDH)-820* CK(CPK)-124 ALK PHOS-101 AMYLASE-80 TOT BILI-0.4 [**2113-3-23**] 02:57PM   LIPASE-33 [**2113-3-23**] 02:57PM   cTropnT-<0.01 [**2113-3-23**] 02:57PM   ALBUMIN-3.4 CALCIUM-8.4 PHOSPHATE-6.3*# MAGNESIUM-2.0 [**2113-3-23**] 02:57PM   WBC-13.5*# RBC-4.92 HGB-13.3 HCT-42.1 MCV-86 MCH-26.9* MCHC-31.5 RDW-13.0 [**2113-3-23**] 02:57PM   NEUTS-48.5* LYMPHS-45.9* MONOS-3.5 EOS-1.6 BASOS-0.5 [**2113-3-23**] 02:57PM   HYPOCHROM-2+ [**2113-3-23**] 02:57PM   PLT COUNT-435# [**2113-3-23**] 02:57PM   PT-14.3* PTT-23.9 INR(PT)-1.3  EEG: FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: Occasional low amplitude, sharp waves are seen across the right central parietal and parietal occipital regions.
Occasional delta with mixed theta frequency slowing was also seen both synchronously and independently over the posterior quandrants.
ABNORMALITY #2: The background rhythm is disorganized and slowed in the [**5-6**] Hz theta frequency range with intermittent generalized delta frequency slowing.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to presence of occasional sharp waves seen over the right anterior quandrant with intermittent slowing seen both synchronously and independently over the posterior quandrant.
The presence of sharp waves in the right anterior quandrant suggest cortial dysfunction in this region and may predispose to an increased risk for seizures.
The bilateral posterior quandrant, intermittent slowing suggests subcortical dysfunction in these regions.
The background rhythm was also noted to be slowed and disorganized with occasional generalized slowing suggesting deep, midline subcortial dysfunction.
These findings could reflect and early encephalopathy or excessive drowsiness.
OBJECT: 70 YEAR OLD WOMAN WITH A HISTORY OF DEMENTIA FOUND UNRESPONSIVE.
CT head: FINDINGS: Comparison with the prior head CT scan of [**2111-8-12**] re- demonstrates moderate cerebral atrophy, most evident in both frontal lobes.
There is a moderate degree of low density within the periventricular white matter adjacent to both frontal horns, once again compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
There is no new intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
There is a small amount of fluid seen within the left frontal air cell, right maxillary sinus, and sphenoid sinus, with more prominent quantity of fluid within the left maxillary sinus.
CONCLUSION: No acute intracranial pathology.
Again, bilateral frontal and temporal atrophy is identified, which has progressed since the previous MRI study.
There is no midline shift, mass effect, or hydrocephalus.
On diffusion images, no evidence of acute infarct is seen.
There are chronic lacunae visualized in the pons.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct.
Bifrontal and temporal atrophy, which has increased since the previous MRI study of [**2111-3-4**].
Subcortical white matter changes predominantly in the frontal region as before.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt intubated in ED for airway protection and concerns for seizure versus stroke.
CT and MRI ruled out any acute infract but was noteable for known fronto-temporal atrophy consistent with her dementia.
She had an EEG which did not show any evidence of electrographic seizures.
Laboratory workup revealed no evidence of metabolic or toxic cause for her event.
As well, there was also a question of airway obstruction during sleep (OSA) and the family agreed a sleep study would be informative at a later date (to be scheduled by Dr.[**Name (NI) 14065**] office).
The final thought on the etiology of Ms [**Known lastname 103015**] event was that she had an acute episode of choking/airway obstruction.
