History of Present Illness: This is a 63-year-old male with a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction back in 08/[**2181**].
He had ventricular fibrillatory arrest and was defibrillated and intubated.
The outside echocardiogram showed anterior hypokinesis and a large left ventricular thrombus.
He recovered from this incident and was discharged on [**2181-9-25**], and presents now with recurrent angina.
He subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization which demonstrated an 80% stenosis of his left main coronary artery and also a 50% mid stenosis of his left anterior descending artery.
His echocardiogram demonstrated mild lesion or left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the mid and distal anterior septal and inferior septal segments.
He had trivial mitral regurgitation.
He also had developed a right groin pseudoaneurysm which had been stable, and vascular surgery was consulted who felt that this could be managed electively  Past Medical History: Anxiety attacks GERD SEIZURES HTN   Social History: Married, wife [**Name (NI) **].
Coronary artery disease.
Left ventricular function.
Mitral valve disease.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Moderately depressed LVEF.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Results were  REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:           N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions PREBYPASS No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the apex and distal anterior, inferior, septal and lateral wall.
There is hypokinesis of the mid anteroseptal, ineferoseptal and inferior walls..
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] and increased to 3+ from probable mild ischemia.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
It was felt that the patient would benefit from a short rehab stay.
He was thrombocytopenic and plavix was discontinued.
