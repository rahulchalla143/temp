Admission Date:  [**2179-2-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2179-2-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-1-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization ([**2179-2-18**])  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 78 y/o active M who has been feeling bad for the last 10 days.
His girlfriend had a GI illness previously and developed symptoms of URTI and diarrhea.
He went to ED at [**Location (un) **] yesterday with SOB and was found to be in heart failure and was to be admitted but left AMA.
Patient then was seen by his cardiologist who performed an echo at [**Location (un) **] and found to have reduced LVEF of 15%.
Patient returned to [**Location **] where he recieved aspirin, plavix, and started on Nitro gtt and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath where he was found to have 3 vessel disease with 60% proximal LAD, 80% mid LAD, 70% mid LCx, and 90% RCA lesions.
Patient also with elevated wedge of 33 and CI of 1.2.
Patient denies any chest pain.
No current chest pain, no shortness of breath.
States he had several episodes of PND and chest tightness a few days prior.
No fever or chills.
Past Medical History: s/p appy prostate procedure  Social History: Retired plumber Plays hockey 3x week Currently non-etoh; however previous history of heavy drinking quit 25 years ago No drugs No tobacco   Family History: Father had MI (died) age 67 Mother died of TB All children healthy  Physical Exam: T 98.4 Hr 85 114/75 RR 16 O2Sat 98% 3L Gen: NAD, lying flat Heent: PERRL, EOMI, scelra anicteric, MMM Neck: no carotid bruits; Chest: Crackles at R base, clear ant/lat Cardiac: RRR S1/S2 +S3 no murmurs Abdomen: soft, Ext: no edema, DP +2 Neuro: AAOx3   Pertinent Results: Cardiac catheterization ([**2179-2-18**]):  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated a three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had mild non-obstructive disease.
The LAD had diffuse disease along with a 60% proximal stenosis and an 80% bifrucation lesion at the mid-distal segment.
The LCx had a 60-70% stenosis in its mid vessel as well as a diffuse disease.
The dominant RCA had a 90% mid vessel stenosis as well as the diffuse disease throughout.
Resting hemodynamics revealed a severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 19 mm Hg and a mean PCWP of 33 mm Hg.
Left ventriculography was deferred given elevated filling pressures.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
2) Moderate, fixed inferior wall defect.
3) Dilated LV cavity.
4)There is no significant change in reduced uptake in the inferior wall on delayed 24 hour images which suggests non-viability.
His TSH and ferritin were normal and helped rule out metabolic causes of his cardiomyopathy.
A persantine myocardial viability study confirmed his markedly depressed LVEF (19%) and delyaed images showed no evidence of uptake throughout his fixed inferior wall defect, which is suggestive of nonviability.
Since he was asymptomatic and being maximally medically managed, he was discharged home with plans to followup with cardiology and cardiac surgery.

Please notify your primary care doctor, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 35783**] if you experience shortness of breath, chest pressure or pain, light-headedness or dizziness, nausea, vomitting, heartburn or any symptoms that concern you.
* You have an echocardiogram to look at you heart's pumping function scheduled for [**2179-3-29**] at 9 am.
