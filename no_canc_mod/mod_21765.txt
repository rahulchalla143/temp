Admission Date:  [**2183-7-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-8-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2108-6-10**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Lasix / Paxil / Allopurinol / Lipitor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation, Central Venous Access   History of Present Illness: HPI: 75yo M with complex history, including CCU admission [**Date range (1) 61041**] for NSTEMI c/b shock w/ IABP, intubation, trach/[**Date range (1) 282**], and s/p medicine admission [**Date range (1) 61042**] with repeat NSTEMI, trach replacement, removed 1 wk ago, now w/acute on chronic dyspnea x 2d.
He gradually became dyspneic and on [**2183-7-25**] noted inability to lie flat and marked PND.
He was brought to the ED today where he was in moderate respiratory distress and was transiently on BiPAP.
ABG: 7.26/73/79, concerning for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Past Medical History: 1.NSTEMI [**4-29**] - cardiac cath [**4-29**] w/ 3VD: distal LM 50%, Lcx 60%, OM2 90%, OM1 80%, no intervention, dropped BP at end of cath w/ PEA arrest---> resuscitated w/ epi/pressors 2.
EF 35% 1-2+MR [**5-29**] echo (had flash pulm edema on last admit)  3.
COPD on home Oxygen (2L for years) Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is pulm fev1 590 cc by report- no pft's here 4. h/o pneumothorax 5. depression 6.
Left atrial abnormality.
Left axis deviation with left anterior fascicular block.
Right bundle-branch block.
Probable old inferior wall myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2183-7-16**] no significant diagnostic change .
Interval increase of hazy opacities in the right upper lung zone and right lower lung zone.
These findings could represent asymmetric CHF, but an infectious process cannot be excluded.
This could reflect post intubation stenosis or edema.
ECHO [**2183-7-29**]: The left atrium is mildly elongated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with regional dysfunction including hypokinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum  and anterior walls, apex, and distal inferior and lateral walls.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with  mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate  ([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2183-6-9**], the left ventricular cavity is now dilated, moderate aortic valve stenosis is now identified.
The right ventricle was mildly dilated with free wall hypokinesis on review of the prior study.
Brief Hospital Course: # Respiratory distress- Likely COPD and CHF exacerbation worsened by rapid decrease in steroids.
Patient will follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2183-8-18**] for reassessment of his pulmonary function.
# CAD: Patient has known 3VD, last cath ([**4-29**]), no intervention at that time given concurrent illness.
CABG unlikely given severe COPD.
# h/o GIB with gastritis and multiple polyps.
# Anemia - Patient received 1 unit of PRBCs during this hospitalization.
# FEN: Electrolytes were repleted to maintain K>4, Mg>2.
Patient was advanced to a low sodium heart healthy diet.
# Prophylaxis - Patient was continued on PPI for gastric ulcer prophylaxis and heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
