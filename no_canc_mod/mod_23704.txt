He received Dilaudid prn for pain and was transitioned to PO meds when appropriate.
Cardiovascular: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was followed with serial hematocrits and was bolused prn for tachycardia and mild hypotension.
Serial hcts 41.5-31.6-30.2-31.7-29.1-27.4-26.8-26.7-27.3-30.3-28.9-30.4-31.4  He did develop some gross hematuria with clots.
Urology was curbsided and thought this was likely due to traumatic foley placement on ASA and plavix and so the patient was monitored with resolution of hematuria by the end of the hospital stay.
Pt remained in the ICU over the few days after his fall secondary to desaturation when shovel mask removed.
Gastrointestinal/Abdomen: His R abdominal wall hematoma was noted to have expanded some since admission, but eventually became stable.
