He reports to have been treated for many years for COPD, but describes a change in his dyspnea in [**2125**].
Of note, in [**2124**] patient had an oil spill in his basement with significant concrete dust in the construction requiring hospitalization due to pulmonary symptoms.
We have no recent CT scan or PFTs available to us at this time.
Over the last year, he has also been on home O2, and has noted a progessive worsening of symptoms over the last 6 months.
He has noted increasing dyspnea and a slow escalation of O2 requirment.
The patient had an admission to [**Hospital1 34**] in [**10-4**], for which he was treated with a steroid burst and antibiotics for brochroncitis, which improved but again gradualy worsended.
The patient noted that his respiratory symptoms worsened since around the [**Holiday 944**] holiday, with incrasing dyspnea on excersion, a productive cough with mildly blood tinged sputum.
His symptoms continued to worsen, and he began to notice audible wheese and a marked decline in his dyspnea.
CXR showed now right middle and lower chest opacities which were felt to most likely be consisent with airspace disease with possible superimposed pneumonia.

Respiratory Viral Culture (Preliminary):     Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final [**2128-11-30**]):       Negative for Respiratory Viral Antigen.
No pulmonary embolism.
Moderate progression of diffuse interstitial abnormality, predominantly subpleural reticulation and fibrosis.
Diffuse ground-glass opacity superimposed on background interstitial changes.
Findings are concerning for acute pulmonary edema, and could be due to cardiogenic, or non-cardiogenic causes.
Pneumonitis secondary to infectious causes, such as PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] also possible.
# Hypoxia: Most likely etiology of patient's hypoxia and dyspnea is worsening of his underlying pulmonary fibrosis.
He had a CT chest which showed worsening of his underlying disease.
His viral respiratory panel was also negative.
Morphine Concentrate 20 mg/mL Solution Sig: 5-20 mg PO Q1H as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Mental status normal and at baseline   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for worsening of your breathing and low oxygen saturations.
This is likely worsening of your underlying pulmonary fibrosis.
