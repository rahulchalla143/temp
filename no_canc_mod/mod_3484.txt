At that time the patient also had an increasing creatinine with right upper quadrant tenderness on exam.
At the outside hospital the patient was also diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia.
Upon initial consultation, the renal service felt that the patient's worsening creatinine was consistent with ATN with question of FK toxicity.
The patient had fluoro guided aspiration of the right hip on the 28th and 29th.
An MRI on hospital day five also revealed iliopsoas bursitis.
Also with positive sputum cultures growing out GNR.
However, he began to exhibit profound weakness and cogwheel rigidity.
As a result, the question of some sort of neurologic deficit was raised and a workup was begun.
On hospital day 15 EEG was performed which revealed diffuse encephalopathy without seizures.
EMG was also performed and revealed severe generalized polymyopathy.
No clear polyneuropathy with no clear evidence of myopathy.
Central dysfunction seemed to be the cause or major source of weakness.
On hospital day 16 the patient had a tracheostomy placed due to his dependent ventilation needs.
The impression was patient with evidence of encephalopathy and severe sensory motor polyneuropathy on the background of staph bacteremia.
Their impression was that this was likely secondary to acute problems including infection, renal failure and medications.
However, the patient continued to have low grade fevers and workup was continued.
On hospital day 20 the patient had coffee ground emesis aspiration.
The patient's operative site where the Girdlestone was performed was deemed to be erythematous and full.
It was hypothesized that a possible tap would make sense, however, due to the patient being on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage, it was decided to take a wait-and-see approach.
On hospital day 23 the patient had a PEG placed and continued to spike some low grade temperatures.
However, the wound site began to improve on its own and became less suspicious.
The patient continued to spike fevers and with cultures pending.
The patient's medications were titrated as well, however, his white count was 11.2 on hospital day 28 with no other signs or symptoms of infection.
Chest x-ray was negative for pneumo, however, the patient had fungemia as a result and was started on fluconazole on hospital day 29.
On hospital day 31 an ophtho consult was sought to rule out any ophthalmologic involvement, which was the case.
Infected orthopaedic hardware status post removal.
