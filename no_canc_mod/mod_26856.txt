During his last admission he had two large volume taps, EGD revealed large (grade II) esophageal varices, one with a cherry red spot, that were banded.
He then experienced black stools with red clots, and was sent to [**Hospital3 13313**] where he was apparently scoped without evidence of ongoing bleeding.
On arrival he was found to be intubated, off sedation, unresponsive to voice or examination.
This was performed by the Liver team, and he was found to have alot of blood in the stomach and duodenum.
This was suctioned out, but no source of active bleeding was found.

He expired on [**2115-11-29**] in the setting of massive GI bleeding.
#Chronic Resp failure: The patient was extubated and reintubated three times for failure to clear secretions and poor cough reflex.
He was presumed to have a tracheobronchitis with MRSA in sputum from [**11-16**], [**11-20**], and [**11-21**].
He was maintained on primarily pressure support and MMV during times of apnea.
He was treated with a 7 day course of ceftazadime and a 10 day course of vancomycin starting [**11-16**] for tracheobronchitis/ventilator associated pneumonia.
The patient's ABGs revealed a respiratory alkalosis with a PCO2 of 22-23.
His resp alkalosis is likely partially as compensation for met acidosis and due to primary process.
On [**11-23**] the patient had increasing respiratory distress with hypoxemia, felt to be c/w mucus plugging on CXR.
#UGIB/Anemia: EGD revealed blood in the stomach with no active bleeding source.
He has evidence of grade II esophagitis and gastritis.
He had a recurrent bleed on [**11-19**] with 400 cc of bloody return from his OGT, requiring reintubation.
CT of the abdomen on [**11-22**] revealed no retroperitoneal bleed.
He remained guaiac positive through his stay though to be due to the initial GI bleed.
Repeat EGD on [**11-28**] revealed massive amounts of blood in the stomach.
There was so much bleeding that a source was not identified.
On [**11-28**] the pt [**Doctor First Name **] made CMO due to uncontrollable bleeding.
# NASH with hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy resolved with lactulose, rifaximin, and pentoxyfilline.
Diagnostic paracentesis on [**11-20**] revealed no evidence of infection.
As per below, he developed hepatorenal syndrome and was maintained on daily midodrine/octreotide and albumin.
His UNa was less than 10 was UO of [**5-8**] cc/hr, so his symptoms were felt to be c/w hepatorenal syndrome.
# Pancytopenia: The patient developed pancytopenia on [**11-21**] with platelet dropping to the 30s, hematocrit dropping to 30, and WBC dropping from 24 to 4 in 24 hrs.
All cell lines gradually rose with cessation of further Vancomycin dosing.
#Chest Pain: The patient developed chest pain on the night of [**11-23**].
EKG revealed poor R wave progression and loss of anterior forces.
Cardiac enzymes revealed no elevation in CK, but Troponin elevated at 0.11 to 0.19 (likely due to renal failure).
TTE on [**11-25**] to eval for pericardial effusion was negative for effusion.
#UTI: The pt completed a 10 d course of Vanc for enterococcus growing in urine on [**11-14**].
