Bcx from [**6-24**]: Gram neg rods (prelim)  CXR from [**6-25**]:  In comparison with the study of [**6-24**], there is little overall changein the extensive left-sided pneumonia that involves much of this side of the lung.
Retrocardiac atelectasis or consolidation is again noted.
Mild blunting of the costophrenic angles again seen.
CT head from [**6-23**]:  no intracranial pathology  RUQ US fro [**6-23**]:  Coarsened and echogenic liver with probable focal areas of focal fatty sparing.
Please note, while the appearance is in part due to fatty deposition,more advanced forms of liver disease such as cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot be excluded.
Clinical correlation is advised and consideration may be given to MRI if clinically indicated.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2182-6-26**] 4:38 PM Large consolidation in the left upper and mid lung, consistent with infectious process appears to be minimally different from the prior study with no obvious evidence of improvement.
There is unchanged cardiomegaly with small amount of left pleural effusion that appears to be unchanged as well.
No appreciable evidence of volume overload is demonstrated.
If no clinical symptoms of improvement are present, evaluation with chest CT, preferably after injection of IV contrast might be considered to exclude the possibility of post-obstructive pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: #Bacteremia:  On HOD 1, pt was found to grow g+ rods c/w clostridium or bacillus.
However, given the concern for septic shock, a trigger and MICU consult was called.
Pt was transported to MICU where her pressures improved with fluids without a pressor requirement.
Pneumonia: Initial CXR in ED showed left perihilar opacity consistent with pna.
with continued fevers, we obtained a repeat the next evening which showed worsening of her pna to include upper and lower lobes.
It is unclear at this point whether the pna was seeded by the bacteremia or a separate issue.
Patient transferred to the MICU on [**6-25**] for hypoxia requiring a nonrebreather.
Even with her episode of hypotension prompting the MICU transfer on [**6-25**] she didn't have any acute MS changes.
Transaminitis: Unclear etiology but were initially thought to be related to hypoperfusion state vs. hepatitis or possible rhabdo given elevated CK.
We ordered hep serologies which were negative and trended the LFTs which generally improved over time but findings on US were suggestive of chronic liver diases.
Of note, LFT elevations are also common with Streptococcal pneumonia and legionella; given the positive legionella urine test this was likely the cause.
Acute Renal Failure: Pt came in with Cr 1.6, and this began trending down with hydration.
# Migraine headaches: Patient continued on her amitriptyline but had positive serum tox for TCAs consistent with chronic overdose (no signs of toxicity.)
# Hyperglycemia: During admision the pt was found to have high glucose levels w/ elevated HgA1C 7.8.
Outpatient Lab Work Check CBC, Chem 7, LFTs   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Mental status changes Pneumonia Bacteremia Acute Renal Failure .
Secondary: Respiratory failure Elevated transaminases and bilirubin (liver function tests) Hyperglycemia Anemia     Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**], You were admitted to the hospital on [**2182-6-24**] because you were having some increased confusion, and you were found to have a blood-stream infection on admission and severe pneumonia.
Test showed that you had bacteria in your blood and urine.
Bacteria can cause all of the symptoms that you experienced including fever, cough, pneumonia and stomach upset.
One of the bacteria found (called legionella) often grows in anything contain old, stagnant water such as an old air conditioner which you stated that you had.
Although you initially continued to have fevers and sweating on antibiotics you tempature slowly returned to [**Location 213**] and your need for supplamentary oxygen decreased.
However, because of the severity of the pneumonia which you had, you will need to remain on home oxygen for a short time while you finish your antibiotics and recover.
It will also be very important to follow-up with your PCP (see appointment scheduled below) and to have a repeat chest xray in [**1-24**] weeks to ensure that your pneumonia has resolved.
While you were in the hospital, it was found that tests of your liver function were abnormal and an ultrasound showed changes in your liver that were suggestive of chronic liver disease.
Also, we have scheduled an appointment for you to see a liver specialist (hepatologist) to determine why there are these chronic changes seen in your liver on ultrasound.
Also, it was found that you blood sugar was high and a test over you blood showed that your hemoglobin A1C (which is a measure of chronic high glucose in your blood) was elevated.
This suggests that you may have abnormally high glucoses levels chronically which could suggest you might be at risk for diabetes.
