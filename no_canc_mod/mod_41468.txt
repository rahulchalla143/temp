ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient continued with hemodialysis three times per week for the next two weeks.
HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  The patient's hypertension continued to be difficult to control, but he eventually was established on a successful regimen which included high-dose long-acting beta blocker, amlodipine, Lasix, and quinidine by mouth three times per day.
He was evaluated by Audiology, who reported moderate sensor neural hearing loss, and markedly impaired discrimination, and moderately severe to severe mixed loss on the right, with the prior description being of the left.
BELL PALSY ISSUES:  The patient was determined to have a left-sided bell palsy; possibly also related to his ethylene glycol toxicity.
This was felt likely secondary to his renal failure and extended hypertension.
A magnetic resonance imaging of the head was performed which did not show any effacement, or a shift, or masses.
The patient was instructed to contact his primary doctor or come to the Emergency Department with any chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or blurry vision.
It was very important that he not stop this medication without talking with a physician.
Renal failure.
