On [**4-30**], [**2160**], she had an epidural injection for lumbar spinal stenosis.
On [**5-2**], she developed chest pain and was diagnosed with NSTEMI and received a coronary artery stent.
Repeat blood cultures in [**Month (only) **] were positive for Strep viridans.
TEE on [**5-27**] showed no vegetations.
She was discharged to rehab where she stayed until [**8-30**] and had improved back to her usual state of health except for an area on her left thigh that looked like a cellulitis.
She became febrile and very ill, so returned to the ED on [**9-1**].
She was admitted on [**9-3**] with fever, low back pain, and left thigh redness.
Patient had pancytopenia (WBC 2.2, HCT 26, PLT 122), CXR showed right basilar atelectasis, temp 100.6 ??????
Oncology thought pancytopenia was secondary to infection, and not a primary [**Last Name 15482**] problem.
Pancytopenia workup in the past including iron studies, B12, folate, TSH, SPEP, lymphocyte testing, Rh, [**Doctor First Name **] were all per report inconclusive.
Bone marrow aspirate was on [**2161-9-16**] in the L posterior iliac crest, that showed paucity of iron staining, for which the patient was started on iron supplementation.
TEE [**9-7**] showed mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation, and trace pulmonic regurgitation, without any effusions, normal LV function, and without vegetations.
CT did not show any evidence of fluid collection or worsening of the discitis.
Abdomen showed generalized anasarca.

[**2161-9-29**]   TEE - IMPRESSION: No abscess or vegetations seen.
[**2161-9-29**]   EEG - IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of moderate diffuse background slowing.
These findings are indicative of a moderate diffuse encephalopathy which is etiologically non-specific.
There are frequent bilateral broadly distributed epileptiform discharges indicative of epileptogenic potential.
There are no electrographic seizures.
[**2161-9-25**]   MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST - IMPRESSION: Multiple foci of signal abnormalities on diffusion images with occipital lobe with questionable low ADC changes and could suggest acute infarcts.
No MRI signs of an abscess formation or meningeal enhancement seen.
No epidural or subdural fluid collection or enhancement seen.
[**2161-9-23**]   TTE - IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
Hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
No significant valvular regurgitation seen.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiogram may better assess for valvular vegetations.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 year-old woman with morbid obesity, CAD, NSTEMI, L4-L5 discitis, history of pancytopenia since [**2159**] was transferred from [**Hospital6 17183**] for further evaluation of fever.
She developed hypotension requiring pressors and found to have [**Hospital6 89618**] UTI and bacteremia and possible embolic strokes per MRI.
Differential diagnoses include undiagnosed abdominal infections versus occult malignancy.
ACTIVE PROBLEM LIST: # [**Name2 (NI) **] bacteremia with history of other Gram positive bacteria in blood: Treated with Ceftazidime from [**9-27**] - [**10-4**], then changed to Zosyn [**10-4**] - [**10-25**].
When her mental status did not improve with her fever curve and antibiotic therapy, an MRI was done with revealed acute/subacute infarctions.
Neurology was consulted and felt that this findings were mostly likely septic embolic.
An EEG was also done which did not reveal seizure activity and was consistent with diffuse metabolic encephalopathy.
# CVA, subacute and acute infarcts: We did recommend MRA Head and Neck to better characterize lesions to see if they were septic emboli that caused CVA.
Records revealed that she was pancytopenic in [**2159**], which was reportedly in the setting of an acute infection.
While she was found to have the psuedomonal bacteremia as above, it was unlikely to be the source of her original fevers as she had negative blood cultures at the OSH.
The biopsy of her L4/L5 was unrevealing and her CSF analysis was no consistent with infection.
As she had a high LDH and splenomegaly on imaging studies, there was concern for an occult malignancy.
She had concerning skin findings and tenderness over her left hip, which was reported the site of prior corticosteroid injections.
Dermatology was consulted who felt that the changes were most likely resolving cellulitis that had been exacerbated by her anasarca.
The etiology of her original fevers remains unclear.
# Hypernatremia: Resolved with adding free water to tube feeds.
# Respiratory distress: Thoughout her ICU course, patient was noted to be tachypneic with an oxygen requirement which was not present prior to her hospitalization.
Her oxygen requirement varied throughout her course.
her oxygen requirement gradually decreased.
Later in her ICU course, he BP dropped in the setting of apparent sepsis to the point where she required pressors for BP support for a few hours.
As there was initial concern for bleeding and hypotension, her home medications were held.
7. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1) packet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
8. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.

10. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
