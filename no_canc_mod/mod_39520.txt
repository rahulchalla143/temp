She has had 6-7 years of progressively worsening SOB and has had an extensive prior workup (please refer to Dr.[**Name (NI) 84946**] notes) including an open lung biopsy in [**10/2118**] which was initially thought to show sarcoidosis, but after re-review is more consistent with a hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
She has had numerous prior ICU admissions for SOB and has been intubated in the past.
She has had worsening SOB for the past several days, possibly worsened by the heat, and has been using her inhaler more frequently so came to the ED.
On exam she was taking rapid shallow breaths with poor air movement so got 3 back-to-back nebs with some improvement.
She initially refused steroids due to h/o steroid psychosis.
On arrival to the MICU, patient is tachypneic and speaking in short sentences.

No previous tracing available for comparison.
A subpleural 2-mm nodule in the right upper lobe is unchanged from [**2116**].
The pleural surfaces are normal without effusion or pneumothorax.
There is evidence of severe tracheobronchomalacia, with near complete and, in places, complete collapse of the trachea and bronchial tree during dynamic expiration.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is no central lymph node enlargement.
Though this exam is not tailored for the evaluation of infradiaphragmatic structures, no abnormality is seen.
There is a subacute nondisplaced fracture of lateral left sixth rib, new from [**2119-3-12**].
Severe tracheobronchomalacia with air trapping.
No lung parenchymal abnormality to suggest diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis or sarcoid.
Subacute fracture of the lateral left sixth rib.
Brief Hospital Course: 39 year old woman with asthma and possible hypersensitivity pneumonitis who presents with shortness of breath.
Acute issues: # Tracheobronchomalacia (NEW DIAGNOSIS): Patient states symptoms are similar to prior asthma exacerbations  but no wheezing on exam and CXR shows no hyperinflation of lungs.
CT Trachea performed and showed severe tracheobronchomalacia.
Chronic issues: # Anxiety/Depression:  Continued citalopram, trazodone.
# Sinus tachycardia: Likely related to anxiety.
