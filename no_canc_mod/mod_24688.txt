Past Medical History: CC:[**CC Contact Info **] HPI: 74F who was in her usual state of health until today when she fell off a stool in which she was standing on striking her forhead and the back of her head on the floor.
Head CT at OSH showed parafalcine SDH and SAH, pt was on Coumadin for Afib.
HEENT: Normocephalic, mid forehead laceration with sutures Neck: Hard collar in place.
Point tenderness at C8 Extrem: Warm and well-perfused.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift  Sensation: Intact to light touch  Reflexes: B T Br Pa Ac Right     2 2 2  2  2 Left      2 2 2  2  2  Toes mute bilaterally  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements     Pertinent Results: CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2103-6-30**] 2:07 PM   FINDINGS: A relatively thin right parafalcine subdural hematoma, measuring 4 mm is unchanged.
There is also trace left frontovertex subarachnoid hemorrhage, either unchanged to marginally smaller than before, related to resorption or redistribution.
There is no new intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no acute major vascular territorial infarct.
There is no evidence of mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
Incidental note is made of hyperostosis frontalis interna.
The osseous structures and extracalvarial soft tissues are otherwise unremarkable, with no acute fracture.
IMPRESSION: Thin right parafalcine subdural and small left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage, unchanged over the short interval, with no new bleed.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2103-6-30**] 2:08 PM   FINDINGS: There is no acute fracture.
There is multilevel degenerative disease, which is worst at C3-C4 with significant loss of intervertebral disc space height, moderate ventral spinal canal narrowing with posterior disc protrusion and osteophytosis.
There is no significant neural foraminal narrowing.
Diffuse interlobular septal thickening in the imaged lung apices suggests a component of volume overload.
Several prominent tracheoesophageal lymph nodes are present, measuring up to 1 cm in short-axis (3:63-68); these are of unclear significance, but may occasionally be seen with CHF.
No evidence of acute fracture or traumatic malalignment.
Biapical diffuse interlobular septal thickening suggesting a component of volume overload, which should be correlated clinically.
1 cm tracheoesophageal nodes in the superior mediastinum, incompletely imaged and non-specific (though may occasionally be seen with CHF); if clinically indicated, this finding can be further evaluated with a dedicated chest CT, on an elective basis.
CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) Study Date of [**2103-6-30**] 2:35 PM  mediastinal contours are unremarkable except for mild prominence of the azygos vein.
There is mild diffuse increase in the interstitial markings consistent with a mild degree of volume overload.
The pleural surfaces are smooth without significant pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly with mild volume overload.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2103-7-1**] 9:33 AM  FINDINGS: Similar to the examination from one day prior there is a small right parafalcine subdural hematoma measuring approximately 4 mm in greatest dimension (2:21).
There is a small focus of intra-axial hyperdense material within a left parafalcine sulcus (2:20) which appears similar to slightly smaller in size compared to the prior examination.
No new areas concerning for hemorrhage are present.
The size and configuration of the ventricles is unchanged, and there is no midline shift or herniation.
There is a bifrontal hyperostosis.
IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of small right parafalcine subdural hematoma and small left parafalcine subarachnoid hemorrhage.
She was ambulated by PT and did well - she was tolerating po intake and her pain was well controlled.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion, lethargy or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
New onset of the loss of function, or decrease of function on one whole side of your body.
