ESCHERICHIA COLI.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**7-/2446**]) immediately if          sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this patient's isolate.

Heparin induced thrombocytopenia Invasive procedures relating to the problem: [**2144-7-31**] Thrombectomy of right iliofemoral artery.
[**2144-8-4**] Superficial femoral artery thrombectomy.
Bilateral lower extremity arteriography,            Rheolytic thrombectomy left common and external iliac            artery,left external iliac stent placement.
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia was recognized as the etiology of the patient's presenting problem of bilateral lower extremity ischemia.
This was continued until a recalcitrant bleeding duodenal ulcer developed after which she was maintained on aspirin only for the majority of her remaining hospital stay.
After the initial treatment of the HIT, there were no recurrent clinical sequels of her HIT.
Duodenal ulcer, bleeding s/p endoscopic treatment with cautery and epinephrine injection x 3 After anticoagulation for the patient's HIT and bilateral lower extremity arterial thromboses, she developed significant UGI bleeding.
Endoscopic evaluation revealed a duodenal ulcer and a gastric ulcer as the source of her bleeding.
The duodenal ulcer was the primary contributor.
Prior to discharge, she was restarted on Coumadin 5 mg nightly and has tolerated resumption of the coumadin without evidence of recurrence of her bleeding.
Supraventricular tachycardia Throughout her hospital stay, the patient has had SVT on occasion but this has improved significantly with beta blockade, amiodarone, and diuresis.
She is being discharged with amiodarone but it may be possible to discontinue this after further resolution of her current illness.
Subacute subdural hematoma The patient developed a diminished level of consciousness and increased agitation several weeks into her admission.
Bilateral subacute subdural hematomas were demonstrated.
Acute blood loss anemia requiring transfusion The patient's blood loss was secondary to her upper GI bleeding.
Left pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis, ultimately requiring video assisted thoracoscopy with partial decortication and chest tube placement: [**2144-8-14**] Left thoracoscopy [**2144-9-9**] Left thoracoscopy with removal of pleural fibrin and evacuation of empyema cavity with placement of chest tubes  The patient had developed a chronic left thoracic pleural effusion following her CABG.
Ultimately this became an infected collection and was found, following VATS, to contain E. Coli.
Summation: The patient has undergone a series of insults following her emergency CABG on [**2144-7-16**] beginning with bilateral lower extremity ischemia due to heparin induced thrombocytopenia, bleeding duodenal ulcer and bilateral subdural hematomas probably secondary to anticoagulation, and multiple foci of infection with the Left empyema representing the largest one.
Taken together these injuries have required a prolonged course accelerated to some extent by tracheostomy and gastrostomy.
Ms. [**Known lastname 55840**] has made major progress from a serious illness and is being transferred to [**Hospital3 7**] in fair, stable, but improving condition.
