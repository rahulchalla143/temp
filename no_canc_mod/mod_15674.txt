Admission Date:  [**2105-11-24**]     Discharge Date:  [**2105-11-26**]  Date of Birth:                  Sex:  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mild headache and drainage from the right ear.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old white female who presents on referral from [**Hospital3 35151**] as a fresh postoperative patient status post an open reduction and internal fixation of a right wrist fracture who was also found to have bloody drainage from the right ear canal upon arrival in the Recovery Room at [**Hospital1 **] at 4:30 p.m. today.
The patient reports that she fell or tripped on curbing approximately one week prior to admission, landing on her chin and an outstretched right arm and sustained a marked contusion and laceration and abrasion of the chin and a right wrist fracture at that time.
She was seen at that time at the [**Hospital3 8834**] Emergency Room where she had suture repair of the facial laceration and had a right wrist splint applied and she was subsequently discharged home.
Due to the findings of bloody drainage from the right ear following the surgical procedure earlier today, she was seen in consultation by ENT.
The ENT doctor requested a CT scan to rule out a basilar skull fracture due to the history of falling a week prior and the CT scan was obtained which failed to show any fracture; however, it did reveal an acute on chronic subdural hematoma and traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage in the posterior [**Last Name (un) 44708**] and tentorium.
The patient was, therefore, transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital for neurosurgical evaluation.
History of coronary artery disease.
History of trigeminal neuralgia right side of the face.
History of prostate cancer and brain cancer in her brother.
She denied any use of tobacco or alcohol.
The entire general physical examination including the head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, heart, lungs, and abdomen was essentially unremarkable with the exception of a right forearm cast which was covered with stockinette and which showed protruding hardware.
Otherwise, there was no clubbing, cyanosis or edema of the extremities.
Her right fingers were warm, dry, and could wiggle all five fingers of the right hand with pink nail beds and no appreciable edema noted.
Also, she had a contused ecchymotic area of the chin with Steri-Strips on the lower chin laceration and a crusted dry small laceration beneath the chin.
She also had fractures of the bilateral incisor teeth, the front teeth, and had overall poor dentition.
The right ear canal was positive for dry blood with a thin walled clot in the canal versus a hemotympanum.
There was mild excoriation, crusting of the canal.
The right pupil showed a small cataract and was reactive, 2.5 mm to 1.5 mm, briskly with extraocular movements intact and peripheral vision full to confrontation grossly.
There was no drift of the upper extremities.
The sensory examination was intact to light touch throughout except that she noted slight decreased light touch to the right fifth finger.
The deep tendon reflexes were essentially within normal limits with the right Achilles absent, left Achilles slightly diminished and the right plantar response mute and the left plantar response downgoing.
There was a slight increase tone of the right leg at the knee.
There was no ankle clonus and gait and Romberg were not tested due to the patient's recent postoperative status.
A CT scan reviewed from the [**Hospital3 8834**] showed an acute on chronic left-sided subdural hematoma with chronic phase along the entire hemisphere with a more acute phase measuring approximately 0.8 by 4 cm clot along the upper left frontal lobe.
There was a positive midline shift of the deeper brain structures.
There was also traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage along the tentorium and posterior [**Last Name (un) 44708**] but the basilar and prepontine cisterns were clear and showed no evidence of blood.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Due to clinical findings and findings on the outside CT scan, the patient was admitted to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit for observation and q. one hour neurological checks throughout the night.
On the morning following admission, the patient underwent a left frontal subdural bedside evacuation of the hematoma with placement of a subdural drain.
She spent the next two days in the Neuro Intensive Care Unit and showed a normal neurologic examination and a CT scan showed resolution of the subdural hematoma and the drain was subsequently removed on [**2105-11-25**].
