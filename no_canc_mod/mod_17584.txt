There is no evidence of significant shift of normally midline structures, though there is mild surrounding mass effect.
No intracranial hemorrhage or hydrocephalus is identified.
Contrast-enhanced imaging displays matched abnormalities, in blood volume, blood flow and mean transit time in a left middle cerebral artery distribution.
CTA OF THE HEAD AND NECK FINDINGS: There are severe stenoses noted at the origins of the vertebral arteries bilaterally.
Additionally, the right common carotid artery displays a complete occlusion within its mid portion extending superiorly where it recanalizes via branches of the right external carotid artery.
No significant stenosis is noted at the right common carotid artery bifurcation.
The left common carotid artery bifurcation displays a high-grade stenosis involving the proximal left internal carotid artery, which appears to recanalize somewhat distally near its entrance into the carotid canal, where a small "string" lumen is present.
Intracranially, there is marked pruning of many of the branches of the left middle cerebral artery, consistent with a focal filling defect involving the M2 segment with multiple smaller filling defects not definitely visualized but present based on reconstructed images, all suggesting dispersion of embolic fragments.
There is no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation or AV malformation.
The patient is noted to have a congenitally hypoplastic left maxillary sinus.
Large left middle cerebral artery distribution infarct with no evidence of ischemic penumbra by perfusion imaging.
Large filling defect of left M2 segment with numerous distal defects.
No hemmorhage seen.
High-grade bilateral stenoses of the vertebral arteries at their origin with mid-to-distal occlusion of the right common carotid artery and recanalization by branches of the right external carotid artery.
Near complete occlusion involving the proximal left internal carotid artery until area of distal recanalization, as noted above.
Minor ST-T wave abnormalities are present.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 88 134 92 390/435.57 56 56 8   PA/LAT: No active disease  Repeat NCHCT [**5-28**]: Evolving large left MCA stroke.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
Video swallow: The patient demonstrated oral dysphagia with delay in the oral phase of swallowing.
The patient also had mild pharyngeal dysphagia as evidenced by delayed laryngeal elevation and delayed pharyngoesophageal valve closure.
The patient demonstrated aspiration with thin barium after consumption of solid consistency material.
Mild oral and pharyngeal dysphagia due to delay in oral phase of swallow and impaired laryngeal elevation.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers (cannot definitively exclude).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 50 yo man with Left MCA stroke s/p TPA at 2 hours at OSH and arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] at 6 hours 5 minutes time.
Onset of current symptoms was 11:45 PM last night, but wife notes that early yesterday morning(0200 on [**4-24**]) patient had 20 minutes of slurred speech which completely resolved.
The concordance of images on CT perfusion, mean transit time and mean volume suggest that any intervention would both be dangerous and unlikely to yield any recovery in this patient.
Neuro:  A repeat CT head at 24 hours from TPA showed evolving MCA infarct but otherwise unchanged, no new infarct or bleed.
Echo with bubble study showed normal EF without atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale or interatrial aneurysm.
Etiology of the stroke was likely due to pre-existing vascular disease from his course of radiation in [**2146**].
Ruled out myocardial infarct by cardiac enzyme x 3.
GI:  Initially noted to have a transaminitis on [**5-26**] labs which trended downward throughout hospital coures.
On exam, nontender abdomen without nausea or vomiting, tolerating PO.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Hospital for Special Care  Discharge Diagnosis: primary diagnosis: Left middle cerebral artery stroke  secondary diagnosis: History of vocal cord cancer status post radiation to neck Hepatitis C Smoker   Discharge Condition: Awake, alert.
Right upper motor neuron facial weakness and flaccid right arm.
You will need to follow-up with a stroke neurologist.
