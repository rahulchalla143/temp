Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: Vitals: T:99.6 BP: 163/84 P:85 R:22 18 O2: 96RA General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, +lateral visual field cut L eye (pt's BL) Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, decreased BS R base.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, mild ttp epigastrium, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
+venous stasis changes.
No evidence of interval subarachnoid or other intracranial hemorrhage since the pre-procedure examinations of [**2147-6-26**].
Status post initial coiling of the large, lobulated left carotid terminus and possible carotico-ophthalmic aneurysm; however, the current examination suggests that there is still patency and flow within both the superior- anterior portion of the aneurysm which may, in fact, be carotico-ophthalmic, as well as a small amount of flow into the more posterior mid-portion of the aneurysm.
No evidence of vasospasm or ischemia.
No retroperitoneal hematoma.
Right pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Diverticulosis without evidence of active inflammation.
Retained contrast within the renal collecting systems, as well as vicarious excretion of contrast from the gallbladder, presumably from patient's recent angiogram.
CTA Head [**8-24**]: FINDINGS: Patient is status post coiling of a large left ICA aneurysm.
Within this limitation, the bilateral, ACA, MCA and proximal internal carotid arteries appear patent.
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.
There is no evidence of acute infarction identified.
Mild mucosal thickening of the bilateral frontal, ethmoidal and sphenoid sinuses is noted.
No evidence of acute hemorrhage.
Limited evaluation due to streak artifact from coils.
Within this limitation, the ACA, MCA and proximal internal carotid arteries appear patent.
MRA Brain [**8-25**]: BRAIN MRI: There are areas of hyperintensity on the diffusion and T2-weighted and FLAIR images in the left frontal and parietal regions with several tiny foci in the subcortical region indicative of infarcts.
Following gadolinium, no abnormal enhancement is seen.
There is a large coil pack identified in the left supraclinoid region where coiling was performed for aneurysm.
Mild enhancement is seen in the surrounding region, but no intrinsic enhancement to the coil PEG is identified.
IMPRESSION: Probable subacute infarcts in the left side of cerebral hemisphere involving the cortex in the posterior frontal and anterior parietal region with several small subcortical infarcts.
No definite flow signal is identified within the coil pack or adjacent to it to indicate residue aneurysm.
No vascular occlusion or stenosis seen.
The evaluation of the left supraclinoid internal carotid on projection images is somewhat limited secondary to artifacts from the adjacent coil pack.
IMPRESSION: Coil pack is visualized from embolization of the left supraclinoid internal carotid artery aneurysm.
No definite residual flow signal identified within the aneurysm.
Some intrinsic foci of thrombus are seen within the coil pack.
No vascular occlusion in the arteries of anterior or posterior circulation.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 year old woman with hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, status post inital step in multistage stent-assisted coiling for L ICA aneurysm and recent R ankle fracture s/p ORIF with immobilization who was transferred from outside hospital on [**2147-8-19**] for management of pulmonary embolism and possible pneumonia.
She is status post MRI compatible IVC filter placement at outside hospital on [**2147-8-18**] and is on a heparin weight based protocol for her pulmonary embolism.
Her pleuritic lung pain which was present on admission resolved within 24 hours.
She underwent an MRI/MRA to evaluate her left ICA aneurysm which was reviewed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH, the patient's daily 25 mg po HCTZ was discontinued as she was noted to have low systolic blood pressures.
On the morning of [**2147-8-22**], the patient was noted to have an elevated systolic BP in the 150s, but this was deemed likely secondary to her treatment with high dose prednisone since the day prior.
On [**8-22**] patient went for an angiogram for a stent assisted coiling of L ICA aneurysm and went to the ICU for monitoring.
In the afternoon, pt reported R arm weakness with distal numbness.
She had no speech deficits or facial droop.
Prior to discharge she had a MRI Coil pack is visualized from embolization of the left supraclinoid internal carotid artery aneurysm.
No definite residual flow signal identified within the aneurysm.
Some intrinsic foci of thrombus are seen within the coil pack.
No vascular occlusion in the arteries of anterior or posterior circulation.
On [**8-27**] she became therapeutic on Coumadin and her Heparin drip was stopped.
