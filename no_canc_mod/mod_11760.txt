Admission Date:  [**2132-2-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2132-2-28**]  Date of Birth:   [**2087-11-5**]       Sex:  F  Service: Medicine HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 9035**] is a 44-year-old woman with alcoholism who was transferred from an outside hospital with a chief complaint of hypotension, acute respiratory distress syndrome, in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.
Her review of systems at that point was positive for chest pain and shortness of breath.
She denied bright red blood per rectum or urinary complaints.
She had no sexual activity in the past five months.
Her examination at the outside hospital was notable for present bowel sounds and periumbilical tenderness.
She received intravenous fluids, potassium repletion, Demerol, and Vistaril for pain management.
A CT scan of her abdomen showed a fatty liver, diffuse enlargement of the pancreas with areas of decreased enhancement, presenting the question of necrosis, moderate fat surrounding, and no fluid collection.
On the morning of [**2-7**], the patient complained of shortness of breath.
A chest x-ray showed bilateral alveolar infiltrates.
The patient was given diltiazem for sinus tachycardia, phenylephrine drip for hypotension.
Chronic vertigo.
Father with history of coronary artery disease.
No meaningful response to verbal or tactile stimuli.
She had no doll's eye reflex.
No jugular venous distention was appreciated.
Her heart had a regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla.
She had decreased breath sounds at the bases and in the apices without rales or wheezes.
The patient became agitated with epigastric pressure.
There was no peripheral edema.
There was no stigmata of chronic liver disease.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at 163 beats per minute with T wave flattening in leads V3 through V6, III, and F.  Chest x-ray on admission revealed bilateral upper lobe alveolar opacities consistent with pulmonary edema.
CT of the abdomen revealed fatty infiltration of the liver; normal spleen, adrenals, and kidneys.
Small bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
Diffuse enlargement of the pancreas, moderate fatty stranding, some areas of decreased enhancement.
No abscess or fluid collections.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed ascites, no gallstones.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 44-year-old female with alcoholism who presented to the [**Hospital1 188**] from an outside hospital with physiology consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome and hypovolemic shock secondary to third spacing from necrotizing pancreatitis.
By [**2-15**], the ventilator was decreased to minimal pressure support, but the patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial.
A chest x-ray on [**2-17**] revealed a right upper lobe infiltrate and sputum Gram stain showed gram-negative rods.
The patient remained stable but was not extubated due to inability to decrease sedation and improve mental status.
The patient continued to be treated for presumed ventilator-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and gentamicin after she was transferred to the hospital floor.
The patient was intermittently tachycardic, worse with temperature spikes and sedative withdrawal.
She also had transient episodes of hypotension which were responsive to fluid boluses.
Repeat CT scans showed extensive necrosis.
CT-guided pancreatic aspiration was performed on [**2-15**] which grew no organisms in culture.
A repeat CT scan on [**2-22**] showed stable pancreatic necrosis with developing surround pseudocyst without signs of superinfection.
She was without abdominal pain.
On the morning of [**2-27**], the patient spiked a temperature to 102.
At the time of this dictation, all of these tests were negative.
The patient was switched from imipenem to vancomycin and gentamicin on [**2-17**] because she developed a drug rash to imipenem.
A biopsy revealed perivascular lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltrates consistent with drug reaction.
She was started on Haldol to decrease agitation during the weaning of sedation.
three times per day for agitation and delirium as the Ativan was being weaned off.
The patient also developed a reactive thrombocytosis.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient had mild hypoglycemia presumed secondary to pancreatitis.
Her fingerstick blood glucoses were monitored, and she was maintained on a regular insulin sliding-scale for new diabetes.
At the time of this dictation, she had very little insight into the problems that caused this hospitalization.
