HD was stopped prematurely yesterday due to hypotension to 60/40.
Course complicated during this admission by presumed c. diff colitis due to profuse diarrhea, treated with 14 days flagyl.
On arrival to the ED, initial vitals were T 97.2 HR 120 (afib) BP 123/110 RR 20 100% 4L NC in acute respiratory distress.
He was placed on BiPAP with resolution of respiratory distress.
On review of systems, he has a history of stroke, PE, bleeding with surgery, deep venous thrombosis.
He denies myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain, severe SOB, DOE, ankle edema, PND, Orthopnea, absence of chest pain, palpitations.
On [**2136-12-7**] after episode of CP, the patient was admitted to OSH with non- Q wave MI and underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed 70% LAD instent stenosis, 70-80% instent stenosis at the RCA and the LCx had 90% stenosis and an aortic valve area of 0.9cm.
Post -operatively course complicated by severe hyptnesion requiring high dose pressor support with vasopressin, epinephrine and levophed.
he was transferred to [**Hospital 100**] rehab from OSH for an NSTEMI, [**Hospital 1291**] and CABG complicated by multiple issues described below.

Stable appearance of bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis.

Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE 78 year old male with past medical history of CAD, NSTEMI, s/p CABG (LIMA to the LAD, SVG to OM1 and OM2) and St. [**Initials (NamePattern4) 1525**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1291**] ([**12-12**]) with course complivated by wound dehisence, chronic systolic dysfunction EF 30%, ESRD on HD, afib on coumadin, anemia, recent lower GI bleed with bleeding rectal ulcers and CMV colitis with worsening SOB, acute decompensated heart failure.
After significant discussion regarding sepsis, failure of dialysis without pressor support, multiple wound infections and multiple co-morbities, the patients was made comfort measures only on HD 9.
Antibiotic therapy ([**Name (NI) **]) was restarted to cover staph and enterococcus (VRE) positive blood cultures.
.... # CHF:  Patient initially floridly volume overloaded in acute decompensated heart failure.
Hyponatremia and extremely high BNP also consistent with florid hypervolemia.
Patient did not get full HD session prior to admission due to hypotension.
Acute decompensation also likely triggered by unit of blood given earlier today at rehab facility.
Echo on [**2-28**] showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
CVVH initiated for volume management and NC for respiratory support.
Right upper arm fistula repaired and now working normally.
ANEMIA: Patient with Hct 21 on admission, has a history of transfusion-dependent anemia with GI sources, including rectal ulcers.
Initially concerning for  CMV colitis versus rectal ulcers.
# GPC BACTEREMIA: GPC?????
Likely responsible for his leukocytosis and worsening [**Name (NI) **] picture.
Hypercalcemia also possibly secondary to ischemia, in setting of hypotension and elevated lactate.
Lastly, patient likely has underlying tertiary hyperparathyroidism from ESRD, known to have chronic hypercalcemia in prior records.
Likely acute on chronic physiology.
HYPOTENSION: Likely secondary decompensated heart failure, septic physiology, and overdiuresis at times w/ CVVH.
GRAFT HEMATOMA: Large hematoma of RUE near graft site.
Tender to touch with small area of induration.
Transplant surgery had no plans to evacuate hematoma or fix graft while patient unstable and bacteremic.
Prior history of CMV colitis.
No evidence of colitis on CT scan.
Has resolved but perineal area still red and inflamed.
ANTICOAGULATION: Despite persistent anemia and GIB risk with rectal ulcers, he was continued on heparin gtt given multiple indications, including atrial fibrillation, mechanical valve and presumed clot burden noted on previous hospitalizations.
Has history of chronic AFib, rate controlled with carvedilol, anticoagulated on coumadin.
No evidence of acute MI on ECG.
Lateral ST changes on admission likely secondary to demand ischemia from tachycardia.
Enzymes elevated likely due to renal failure.
Holding Lantus now in setting of poor PO's.
His goals of care may change if his SOB and chest pain return and cannot be managed.
