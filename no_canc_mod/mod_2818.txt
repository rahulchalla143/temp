On [**5-23**], patient awoke with 10/10 pleuritic pain radiating down to left shoulder to left arm associated with SOB and diaphoresis.
She went to PCP who ordered [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CTA which was negative for PE and diagnosed her with pleurisy.
Her pain was mildy improved with the motrin but she developed DOE which progressed to dyspnea at rest over the past 2 weeks.
Also endorsing chest heaviness, pleuritis left sided/LUQ pain, orthopnea and PND.
Her pain would be releived sitting forward.
1 week ago she experienced 1 day of vomiting x5 episodes NBNB.
In the past few days had fevers/chills and abd distention associated with constipation and low grade headache.
Also had dry cough.
Saw PCP who took CXR which showed pna with b/l pleural effusions.
CXR L>R effusion and pericardial effusion.
Triggered in the ED for hypoxia to 89% RA, placed on O2 by N/C + abx(CTX and lev), 2L bolus, followed by 150/hr.
Believe that pleural effusion may be bigger issue.
She felt SOB slightly improved.
Pain worse and different after thoracentesis.
Also endorsed "contact" dermatitis with couple blisters on lower extremities worse 2 weeks ago thought to be a nickel allergy.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion (1.3 cm anteriorly and 1.8 cm around the right atrium).
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
There is brief right atrial diastolic invagination.
There is significant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
No overt tamponade is seen however elevated intrapericardial pressure is suggested.
The small pericardial effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements and appears largely organized with minimal free fluid.
A small right basal pleural effusion.
Additional mild fluid markings of the fissures and slight distention of the vasculature suggests mild pulmonary edema.
Subsequent areas of bilateral atelectasis.
CXR post [**Female First Name (un) 576**]: Infiltrate worse on right, improved on left, no PTX .
[**5-23**] CTA  Grossly normal study, specifically no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
CXR: [**2174-6-15**] INDICATION: Bilateral pleural effusions, status post right thoracocentesis.
When compared to the most recent study, there has been decrease in bilateral pleural effusion, now small.
No pneumothorax is noted.
Bibasilar atelectasis is again noted, left more than right.
Rare atypical epithelioid cell in a background of reactive   mesothelial cells, histiocytes, and lymphocytes; see note.
Note: One hematology slide labeled 1556E-[**2174-6-15**] was   reviewed and demonstrates mesothelial cells; no atypical   cells seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 52 year old female with a history of lone atrial fibrillation and Lyme meningitis presenting with progressive shortness of breath and DOE over past 2 weeks admitted to the MICU with pleural effusions and a pericardial effusion in the setting of presumed viral pleurisy and pericarditis that developed into an effusion after chronic NSAID use possible aspiration/CAP PNA who developed AFIB with RVR secondary to pain and pericardial effusion, transaminitis with cholestasis and acute renal failure in the setting of anemia and NSAID use who has a persistent O2 requirement with pleuritic pain and resolving pericardial effusion.
She improved clinically prior to discharge after CT placement for her L effusion and a thoracentesis to remove her R sided pleural effusion.
Due to her effusions, it was thought she may have an underlying PNA and she was started on levaquin for CAP.
She was given a prolonged course due to concern that she may have had infection in her pericardial fluid.
The day after admission ([**6-7**]) she was intubated for hemodynamic control(Afib RVR 150s), pain control, and for potential procedure for a possible pericardial window.
From a respiratory prospective she was comfortable prior to intubation which was done under rapid sequence given signs of early tamponade.
She was extubated without event when it was determined that cardiology did not think her pericardal effusion needed to be drained.
#Afib with RVR: The Patient has a history of lone atrial fibrillation.
This was thought [**2-23**] to pain and infection vs tamponade physiology.
After extubation and while on the floor the patient did not have any palpitations or further episodes of Afib wtih RVR.
- She will need to discuss with her outpatient physician [**Name9 (PRE) **] with aspirin when her pericardial effusion resolves.
# Pleural Effusions: She presented with pleuritic chest pain which was initially attributed to her pleural effusions.
CHF and cirrhosis unlikely based on H+P.
The most likely diagnosis was a viral infection with a superimposed bacterial process possibly in the setting of aspiration 1 week prior.
After subsequent removal of her bilateral pleural effusions, her symptoms of SOB and O2 requirement resolved.
The decision was made not to drain effusions for diagnostic purposes given the risks involved.
Of note, her effusion improved by echo prior to discharge.
# CAP:  Given her exudative effusion and viral pleuritis there was concern for CAP and possible aspiration.
# Diarrhea:  She had transient episode of diarrhea while on antibiotics, and her diarrhea resolved.
Renal spun urine and it was not active.
Cholestasis and Hepatitis:  She was noted to have to have abnormal LFT's with cholestatsis in addition to pleuritic R sided abdominal pain.
There was concern that she could have either a viral induced hepatitis with cholestasis versus a congestive hepatopathy in the setting of mild volume overload.
Cholecystitis was less likely given the absence of a white count.
Her LFT's trended down independent of diuresis thereby suggesting/confirming a possible viral etiology for her hepatitis and cholestasis.
# Anemia: Baseline hct 40s most recently in [**2171**].
No signs or symptoms of bleeding.
Likely from systemic process going on.
Of note, she is currently menopausal, and has iron studies that suggest she has anemia of chronic disease, or at least anemia with acute inflammation.
