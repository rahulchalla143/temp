Admission Date:  [**2115-11-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2115-11-29**]  Date of Birth:   [**2043-4-4**]       Sex:  F  Service:  C-MED  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a pleasant 72-year-old white female who presented to an outside hospital with chest pain.
The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, questionable hypercholesterolemia, and obvious positive family history of coronary artery disease.
She has reported several episodes of atypical chest pain over the past years and apparently had a thallium and echocardiogram in the past at the [**Hospital6 1708**] with the results unavailable at this time.
She ruled out for myocardial infarction there and was sent home.
She presented again to [**Hospital6 2910**] with a left scapula ache which radiated anteriorly, worse with movement and deep breathing.
Based on this, she was given a stress test, and on the stress test did 3 minutes and 53 seconds on a standard [**Doctor First Name **] protocol with no chest pain and nonspecific ST-T wave flattening in II, III.
She developed dyspnea and possible bilateral claudication during this.
Coronary artery disease, no specific interventions done in the past; however, transthoracic echocardiogram in [**2113-9-22**] showed an ejection fraction of 65% to 70% with trace mitral regurgitation, normal atrial valve, tricuspid valve, and pulmonary valve.
Exercise treadmill test showed nonspecific ST changes with 1-mm ST depressions in II, III, and aVF with shortness of breath and lower extremity claudication.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Diabetes with diabetic neuropathy.
Prior history of pneumonia.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Several brothers and sisters with premature coronary artery disease.
In the cardiac catheterization laboratory they found a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60% with no disease noted in the left main coronary artery, minimal luminal irregularities found in the left anterior descending artery, left circumflex with a moderate first obtuse marginal and second obtuse marginal with 50% lesions, and right coronary artery with 100% occlusion, with left-to-right collaterals filling the right posterior descending artery and right posterior left ventricle.
However, after the cardiac catheterization the patient was noted to be hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure down to the 70s, that was responsive that 3 liters of intravenous fluids.
Her hematocrit dropped from 38 to 29 and noted a large expanding abdominal wall hematoma.
While in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit an ultrasound was obtained that did not show a pseudoaneurysm; however, a large hematoma was noted in the right groin expanding across the abdomen.
She had no recurrent chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath, or radiation, or diaphoresis during her hospital course.
