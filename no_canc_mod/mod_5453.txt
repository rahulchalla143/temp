Post-procedure, he was instructed to keep his BP 110-170, taking Sudafed at home if his BP decreased.
About 2-3 days after his procedure, he noted increasing SOB and DOE.
A non-contrast CT scan was performed to r/o aortic dissection.
It revealed moderate B/L pleural effusions.
Of note, after his carotid stenting procedure, he developed a new rash on his trunk.
Past Medical History: Severe AS Rheumatic heart disease HTN Hyperlipidemia CRI, unknown baseline Stroke/TIA x 2 Clean cath at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2147**]  Social History: Married, lives at home with his wife.

Moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis.
Marked elevation of biventricular filling pressures.
Regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.
Diastolic dysfunction.
There is aortic stenosis which is at least moderate and may be severe (valve not well seen and Doppler interrogation only possible from suprasternal view).
The mitral valve is not well seen but does not appear to be rheumatic, there is no mitral stenosis.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Bilateral atelectasis and retrocardiac opacities, for which repeat PA and lateral were recommended if there is concern for aspiration or pneumonia.
Small left pleural effusion.
VENOUS MAPPING [**10-18**]: Patent bilateral greater saphenous veins with very large diameters on the right and small diameters on the left.
PANOREX: no official read   Brief Hospital Course: 75 y/o male with a h/o rheumatic heart disase, severe AS, HTN, and hyperlipidemia who presented with worsening SOB, determined to have a NSTEMI and left sided heart failure.
NSTEMI/left-sided heart failure - Pt presented to OSH with worsening SOB, without CP, and responded fairly wellthought to have had plaque rupture, resulting in ischemia and diastolic dysfunction, and in the setting of fixed AS developed pulmonary edema.
Moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis.
Marked elevation of biventricular filling pressures.
Based on these findings, recommendation was made to undergo CABG with AVR once recovered from recent carotid stents.
Pt agreed and underwent screening by CT [**Doctor First Name **] as well as multiple pre-op studies and dental work (removal of two teeth).
HYPERTENSION - Initially held beta-blocker and ACE-inhibitor and restarted once renal function improved and CHF better controlled.
HYPERLIPIDEMIA - Pt switched to Lipitor 80 mg in the acute setting (on Zocor as outpatient).
S/P LEFT CAROTID STENT - Pt had history of stroke/TIA, but had persistently normal neuro exams throughout the admission.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction  Secondary: Systolic Congestive Heart Failure, EF 40-45% Hypertension Urinary Tract Infection Hyperlipidemia Coronary Artery Disease Acute Renal Failure Aortic Stenosis   Discharge Condition: BUN=43 Creat=1.6 Hct=30.4 WBC=7.0 BP=116/67 HR=89 Otherwise stable, ambulating, and pain free.
Six hours after receiving Amoxacillin, no wheezing, rashes, fever or other symptoms.
Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack and some fluid accumulated in your lungs because your heart was not working well.
You had a cardiac catheterization which showed severe aortic stenosis (a stiff arotic valve in your heart) and blockages in 3 of your arteries that feed blood to your heart.
You had evidence of bacteria in your urine that needs treatment.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3035**] if you have any chest pain or pressure, trouble breathing, nausea, sweating or any other unusual symptoms.
