The splenic vein is prominent at the level of the spleno-portal confluence, which can be an early indicator of portal hypertension.
Gallbladder wall is markedly thickened with a small gallbladder lumen.
No cholelithiasis or biliary dilatation is seen, and this likely is a manifestation of third spacing/hypoproteinemia.
No focal hepatic lesions.
Marked gallbladder wall edema, without biliary dilatation or cholelithiasis, likely due to third spacing.
Mild distention of the splenic vein, which may indicate early portal hypertension.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 79 year old man with known inguinal hernia with scrotal edema and now with ecchymosis.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Eval for bowel loop strangulation or other mass.
CLINICAL INDICATION: 79-year-old male with known large inguinal hernia and scrotal edema and ecchymosis.
To evaluate for bowel loop strangulation or other mass.
COMPARISON STUDY: CT scan, [**2172-5-11**], which demonstrated a very large right inguinal scrotal hernia containing both right colon and cecum as well as multiple small bowel loops.
The left testis is small and high in position almost within the left inguinal canal, but is otherwise unremarkable.
The right testis and epididymis are also small and similar in appearance to the left and are displaced medially by the large inguinal scrotal hernia sac.
The free fluid within the hernia sac is clear, showing no signs of exudative characteristics.
Within the sac are multiple bowel loops, none of which shows active peristaltic activity.
Some of the loops are fluid-filled and others are air-filled, but the walls of the various small bowel loops show no evidence of edema or air contained within the walls.
Neither is there evidence of free air within the sac.
Color flow and Doppler assessment of the testes and epididymides show normal to perhaps slightly increased vascularity in both testes in a symmetrical distribution with normal pulsed Doppler waveforms.
Color flow assessment of the bowel walls within the scrotal hernia also show vascular flow in all of the interrogated bowel loops.
CONCLUSION: Large right inguinal scrotal hernia containing both large and small bowel.
While the bowel is dilated and flaccid, there are no specific signs of ischemia or necrosis, and specifically there is no evidence of air within the bowel wall, edema within the bowel wall or lack of vascularity.
However, since no contrast is available for use in ultrasound, the assessment for bowel wall ischemia is incomplete on this study and consideration of contrast-enhanced CT scan is recommended.
