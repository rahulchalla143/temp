She became acutely hypotensive, as was found to have a large pubic rami fracture, pelvic hematoma with retroperitoneal bleed and sacral fracture   Past Medical History: 1.
Hypertension 2.
Hypercholesterolemia 5.
Chronic back pain  Social History: Recently widowed, lives in the same house as her daughter but manages everything including paying bills, food shopping.
Right inferior and superior pubic rami fractures, and fracture of the right sacral ala extending into the sacroiliac joint.
No definitive active extravasation identified.
Small pericardial effusion.
Consider cystogram if there is concern for bladder rupture.
[**2178-10-21**] Head CT : No acute intracranial process  [**2178-10-21**] C Spine Ct : 1.
No fracture identified.
Multilevel degenerative changes.
No intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of acute infarct.
However, MRI is more sensitive for the detection of acute ischemia, particularly in this setting of background chronic microvascular infarction.
Interval increase in opacification of right-sided paranasal sinuses, consistent with worsening of inflammatory sinus disease.
[**2178-10-25**] Non invasive carotids : No evidence of internal carotid artery stenosis on either side.
Severe chronic microvascular white matter ischemic disease without acute infarct.
No flow-limiting lesions by MRA, with basilar ectasia.
Extensive sinus disease on the right side involving the frontal, ethmoidal, and sphenoid sinuses.
[**2178-10-27**] CXR : New onset bilateral pleural effusions and associated left lower lobe atelectasis.
Following stabilization of her hemodynamics with blood and fluid, she was taken to Interventional Radiology where she underwent an angiogram and embolization of the right inferior vesicular artery.
There was focal extravasation from the distal vesicular branch.
The Ortho-Trauma service evaluated her pubic rami fractures and recommended non operative treatment.
Her weight bearing status is partial on the right lower extremity and as tolerated on the left lower extremity.
Following transfer to the Trauma floor on [**2178-10-24**] she developed some confusion and her speech was slow.
An MRI was done but there was no evidence of any acute process.
The neurologist felt that her confusion and slowness of speech may be due to mild ischemia from her fall in light of her low hematocrit.
She developed some expiratory wheezes on exam which cleared with Albuterol nebulizers.
A chest Xray was done which showed tiny bilateral effusions and left lower lobe atelectasis.
She subsequently underwent chest PT and incentive spirometry.
She had some degree of dysphagia and soft foods and thin liquids were recommended as well as strict aspiration precautions.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) nebulizer Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.

Right inferior and superior pubic rami fractures 3.
Right sacral ala fracture 4.
Large infra pelvic hematoma  Secondary diagnoses 1.
