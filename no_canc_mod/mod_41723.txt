History of Present Illness: A [**Age over 90 **]yo Russian-speaking F presented from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**2-27**] with worsening dyspnea x 1 day, found to have BNP=[**Numeric Identifier 56841**], crackles and rales on exam, hypertension, and a CXR consistent with volume overload.
Unclear trigger of CHF exacerbation, ?
was found to be in acute respiratory distress.
had episode of hypotension while on nitro gtt, this was stopped and bp quickly recovered.
CAD: 3VD s/p multiple MIs and PCIs 2.
A-V pacer placed in [**2145-10-20**] for sick sinus syndrome  4. h/o atrial fibrillation 5.
HTN 6. hypercholesterolemia 7.
9. anemia secondary to chronic kidney disease 10. constipation 11. hypothyroidism 12. gout 13. h/o colon adenocarcinoma s/p resection 14. h/o C.diff colitis diagnosed on last admission in [**Month (only) 404**] [**2155**]  Social History: The patient previously lived alone but has been at [**Hospital1 100**] Senior Life for 1yr.
neck: supple, no LAD, no thyromegaly, no LAD, no JVD.
chest: crackles at bases b/l, no wheezes.
abd: +bs, soft, nt/nd, no rebound, no guarding, no organomegaly.
CXR [**2156-2-28**]: Persistent congestive heart failure with redistributing, possibly decreasing pulmonary edema, and new bilateral pleural effusions.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior/inferolateral akinesis, apical akinesis/dyskinesis and septal akinesis/hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior akinesis, inferoseptal akinesis/hypokinesis, and inferolateral hypokinesis.
The apical lateral and apical septal segments also appear hypokinetic.
No aortic regurgitation is seen in focused views.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen in focused views.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Elevated systemic pressures.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]yoF with 3VD and CHF, Afib, SSS with AV-PM, p/w 1d dyspnea likely [**1-22**] CHF exacerbation, s/p intubation.
# CHF: CXR consistent with volume overload and BNP very elevated, likely [**1-22**] diastolic dysfunction (EF 25-30%) and possible med/diet non-compliance.
TTE results indicate diffuse myocardial dysfuction, possibly secondary to LAD closure leading to anterior/apical akinesis/dyskinesis.
Treatment options were discussed with family (including intervention for revascularization), and decision was made for medical management.
# CAD: was ruled out for MI upon admission, but TTE consistent with ?
# Afib: AV-paced, on BB and amiodarone, and coumadin (goal INR>2.0), currently in NSR.
# CRI: baseline Cr elevation (high 1s - low 2s), currently at baseline.
# Ppx: PPI, coumadin for Afib, heparin SC, bowel reg.
