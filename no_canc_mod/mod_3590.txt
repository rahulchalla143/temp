Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 19444**] is a 91-year old woman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation off coumadin secondary to remote GI bleeds who presents with acute onset of left sided weakness and slurred speech with some evidence of left hand shaking but only after onset of deficits.
Initial exam showed marked somnolence, mutism, left facial droop, decreased movement of left relative to right with relative preservation in sensory modality, and visual field cut on left.
Her head CT showed no acute bleed or well-developed infarct.
Given the acute onset of left-sided weakness preceding any shaking as well as the history of atrial fibrillation off of coumadin, stroke was deemed more likely than seizure, though seizure was considered as a differential diagnosis.
A 1 mg ativan dose was given as trial to stop seizure without effect.
Further was not given due to concern of somnolence affecting respiration.
Given the elevated NIHSS and absence of absolute contraindications, though multiple relative contraindications were noted, discussion was had with her nephew/HCP whether to give TPA.
After extensive discussion with regarding the potential risks and benefits of TPA in this case with particular consideration to history of GI bleeds, old age, possibility, and possibility of a seizure contributing to weakness/somnolence, and her desire not to live if she were to have any additional deficits, the decision was made to proceed with TPA.
Facial weakness was mostly resolved.
She could elevate both arms to 45 degrees for at least 10 sec though persisted with grip weakness on the left relative to right.
An MRI/A did not demonstrate any acute ischemia, occlusion, or flow limiting stenosis.
It was postulated that the event was not vascular in nature but secondary to a seizure.
