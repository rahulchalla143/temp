IPMN  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP with sphincteroromy  History of Present Illness: 63f h/o severe copd on 4.5L 02 at home, insulin dependent diabetes type 2, obesity, afib on coumadin, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**8-19**] with lower chest pain and epigastric pain and is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cosnideration of ERCP.
Her hospital course is significant for MRCP with prominent intrahepatic dilatation, without change from [**2191**] and mild dilated pancreatid duct and transaminitis.
She had a TTE with EF 55 and mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], chest CTA neg for PE but with compression fracture of thoracic spine.
Currently she complains of severe pain diffusely, including mid-back.
She has new L leg swelling.
She denies vomiting, or diarrhea.
She does not relate abdominal pain to meals, food, or activity.
She denies chest pressure.

Pertinent Results: OSH studies significant for #Chest CTA no PE but with multiple chronic-appearing thoracic compression fractures --need f/u of L kidney masses?
#EKG with afib, normal axis, inferior TWI,  [**2196-8-21**] #MRCP with prominent intra-hepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation NOT significantly changed from [**2191**], no choledocolithaisis, mildly dilated main PD, 2 cystic lesions, suggestive of IPMN, 16mm L hepatic cyst, bil renal cysts .
Subsegmental atelectasis in the left lung base.
Compression deformity of a mid thoracic vertebral body, likely chronic.
LENI ([**2196-8-28**])- No DVT in left lower extremity.
Impression: Severe biliary dilation with CBD measuring 20 mm, with findings consistent with severe sphincter stenosis.
1mm ST depressions in II, III, AvF, and V4-V5.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: 63f h/o severe copd on 4.5L 02 at home, insulin dependent diabetes type 2, obesity, afib on coumadin, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**8-19**] with lower chest pain and epigastric pain and is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP.
Active Diagnoses: #Biliary ductal dilatation, sphincter stenosis: Appeared stable per MRCP report compared with images from [**2191**], but she has periods of transient elevation in LFTs.
(plan to restart coumadin on [**9-3**])  Other cardiovascular medications were continued with no significant perturbation in HR or BP.
#COPD:  The patient has a high O2 requirement at home (4.5L NC), and initial evaluation for procedure was concerning for respiratory function.
#L lower extremity erythema: Consistent with underlying venous stasis and superimposed cellulitis, given warm, blanching erythema.
#Chest Pain:  On the evening of admission ([**2196-8-28**]) she complained of [**11-7**] chest pain that was different from her epigastric pain.
EKG [**8-28**] was largely stable from prior at [**Hospital3 **], both of which showed diffuse downsloping ST elevations consistent with digitalis effect.
Pain improved with nitro SL and she was given diltiazem for rate control.
A f/u EKG on [**2196-8-29**] was again consistent with digitalis effect.
#Back pain: thoracic compression fx, likely secondary to chronic steroid use.
#Kidney masses: NOS, found on CTA of chest, but MRCP of abdomen only described bilateral simple renal cysts.

When you were admitted, you also had a warm, red area on your left leg that was felt to be a skin infection called cellulitis.
You also had chest pain while you were here, but were found not to have a heart attack.
3) Discuss whether you need to be taking antibiotics to prevent pneumonia given that you have been on steroids as an outpatient (bactrim would be the most likely antibiotic).
