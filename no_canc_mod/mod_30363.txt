Admission Date:  [**2164-8-17**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-8-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2111-8-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Advil  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11784**] Chief Complaint: nausea/vomiting  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: 57M w/hx of HTN, afib, CKD p/w decrease appetite, nausea and vomiting for three days.
Yesterday developed headache and photophobia and increasing lethargy.
At that time he denied blurry vision, numbness, tingling or weakness of his lower extremities.
Presented to [**Hospital3 **] where he was found to have sbp 180s and posterior fossa brain mass found on CT head.
Neurological exam remained stable and MRI then read as ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion.
Given significant hypertension and relative young age, pt underwent CT torso with contrast to look for possible Renal /adrenal mass which was unrevealing on wet read  Patient underwent bedside swallow exam and allowed to eat, his home atenolol was restarted at half his regular dose.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally without R/R/W Cardiac: irregular rhythm, nl rate, S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
There was no evidence of apraxia or neglect.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.

Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
There was no evidence of apraxia or neglect.
Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
Large acute infarction with hemorrhagic transformation in the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory, involving both the cerebellar hemisphere and the vermis within this territory.
No evidence of an enhancing mass.
Considerable effacement of the fourth ventricle, without dilatation of the third and lateral ventricles at this time.
No adrenal mass lesions.
No evidence of renal artery stenosis.
Minimal atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta.
4mm gallbladder polyp.
Small hiatus hernia.
Linear atelectasis at the left base.
Small bilateral renal cysts.
Overall unremarkable appearance to roughly co-dominant distal V4 segments of both vertebral arteries; however, there is flow-signal in only the proximal portion of the right PICA vessel with no flow-signal more distally, in the region of acute infarction.
TTE [**2164-8-20**]: IMPRESSION: Marked symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and mild global hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.
; multivessel CAD less likely given distribution of dysfunction).
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Dilated ascending aorta.
These findings are c/w hypertensive heart.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 52 yo male with HTN, CKD, paroxysmal afib (not on coumadin) found to have posterior fossa hemorrhage and R PICA infarct.
# NEURO: patient had a R PICA infarct with posterior fossa hemorrhage, however had minimal neurological deficits, with exam only notable for very mild dysmetria on the R on admission which since improved.
Patient will need anticoagulation for his afib to prevent further strokes.
Patient's TTE on [**8-20**] showed LV hypokinesis and LA enlargement, both of which puts pt at increased risk of clot, and therefore as above, decided to put pt on anticoagulation with dabigatran after discharge.
# ID: pt initially presented with a leukocytosis at 12, which increased to 18.8 after receving a dose of steroids when it was initially suspected that his PICA infarct was a mass (later proved false by further imaging).
He remained afebrile throughout this hospitalization.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: posterior fossa hemorrhage, PICA infarct Secondary: atrial fibrillation, Hypertension, Chronic Kidney Disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
This medication is very important to prevent future strokes.
It is VERY IMPORTANT that you attend this appointment as she will be starting a new medication at this visit that will help prevent new strokes.
