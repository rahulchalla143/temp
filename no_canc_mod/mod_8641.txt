Brief Hospital Course: This is a 59 year old female with DM, HTN, HL, OSA, and GERD with a recent admission, [**1-16**]-11th [**2198**] for GBS sepsis and suspected skin source, who presented with fevers, nausea/vomiting, hypotension, and sepsis likely due to cellulitis of the RLE.
Sepsis / Hypotension: On initial admission, pt met SIRS criteria w/temp to 103, HR Of 112, and SBP in the 70s.
Initial work-up revealed RLE cellulitis as the only sourse of infection: CXR, CT abd/pelvis, UA all normal.
Pt responded well to goal directed therapy, with CVPs trending [**7-26**] and MAPs > 65 with 3 L boluses of LR and brief requirement for Levophed.
Fever downtrended, as did lactate, from 2.4 to 0.8.
On hospital day 2, she remained afebrile and she was transferred out of the ICU.
RLE Cellulitis: Hematogenous source of recurrent cellulitis not apparent as blood cultures were negative.
The likely portal of entry for bacteria is through the skin breakdown on her feet from tinea pedis.
The patient was prescribed Clotrimazole cream to address the issues of Tinea Pedis to try to prevent future episodes of cellulitis.
Acute renal failure: The patient presented with a Cr of 1.3 from a baseline of 0.8, which was likely pre-renal azotemia due to dehydration.
Her hematocrit ranged between 26-32 without transfusion or evidence of hemorrhage.
The patient did have guaiac positive brown stools.
She will need follow-up with her PCP to have BP rechecked and to address whether or not to restart Metoprolol and HCTZ.
