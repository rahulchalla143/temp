Most recent echocardiogram has shown progression of his mitral regurgitation to moderate/severe with a flail posterior leaflet.
The patient, complaining of fatigue and some dyspnea on exertion, presents for surgical evaluation for mitral valve repair versus replacement.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post-bypass: The patient is receiving no inotropic support post-CPB.
An annuloplasty ring is well-seated in the mitral position and there is trace valvular regurgitation.
There is a mean transmitral pressure gradient of 3 mm Hg at a cardiac output of 6.3 L/min.
There is evidence of systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral leaflet, but there is not evidence of outflow tract obstruction or pressure gradient.
Biventricular systolic function is preserved.
All other findings are consistent with pre-bypass findings.

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the right-sided pleural effusion has minimally increased.
As a consequence, the right basal areas of atelectasis have also increased.
On the other hand, the ventilation of the left lung base is slightly improved.
Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette, no evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities indicative of pneumonia.
He was started on Neurontin with plans for increased titration as needed due to right medial thigh numbness and tingling (right groin cannulation.)
His CXR revealed a question of a moderate right pleural effusion and he had an ultrasound which showed less than 300 cc of fluid and he did not undergo thoracentesis.
