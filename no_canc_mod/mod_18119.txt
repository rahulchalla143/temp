Does report 2 episodes of emesis (brown tinge) in the last 10 days, non-bloody non-bilious.
No recent med changes.
Denies chills, cough, SOB, chest pain, dysuria, no increase in abd girth.
Was seen by PCP at [**Name9 (PRE) 53286**] and subsequently referred in for assessment.
Of note, pt admitted in [**12/2195**] for anemia and abdominal pain.
Pt found to be pancytopenic due to hypersplenism.
Head CT, no acute process.
CXR no acute process.
- Esophageal Varices: endoscopy [**2189**]: grade I varices - CKD (baseline Cr = 1.4-1.5): Diabetic Nephrosclerosis by biopsy - Diabetes (last HgA1C [**7-/2190**] 6%) with neuropathy - Ribavirin-induced Hemolytic Anemia - History of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis - Pancytopenia likely d/t hypersplenism - Chronic hyperkalemia - Hypertension - h/o IVDU with methadone maintenance, now off all therapy - DVT s/p IVC filter placement ([**10/2188**])- spontaneous in setting  of hepatic encephalopathy - Hemmorhoids - Hx of PV thrombosis, restarted on coumadin   Social History: Works as a carpenter.
Prior history of IVDU heroin and cocaine quit 7 years ago.
Family History: Father died [**Name2 (NI) 53283**] at 55, no history of blood clots in family  Physical Exam: Vitals: T:97.6 BP:112/56 P:62 R: 18 O2: 100% NRB General: eyes closed mouth open, snoring.
not responsive to pain or loud voice HEENT: pupils 5mm and reactive PEERL sclera anicteric, MMM.
Edontulous Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: chronic venous stasis changes on lower extremities BL.
Warm, well perfused, No edema Neuro: positive corneal reflex.
Other alternate possibilities include CJD but the distribution is contiguous and would be less typical.
The appearances are also not typical for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.
There is interval development of widespread parenchymal opacities, with perihilar and basilar distribution, most likely representing edema, although interval development of infection is a possibility.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
[**2-23**] MRI head: IMPRESSION: Persistent areas of cortical restricted diffusion bilaterally, involving the frontal, temporal, parietal and insular regions as described above, persistent areas of restricted diffusion in the basal ganglia bilaterally.
The possibility of diffuse hypoxic injury is a consideration, other causes cannot be completely excluded, including an infectious process.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus or mass effect.
Findings are nonspecific and can be seen in inflammatory disease or neoplasm.
[**3-9**] Opacification of the left lung has increased, there is now a complete opacification of the left hemithorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 61yoM with hep C cirrhosis complicated with portal vein thrombosis on coumadin, known grade 1 varices, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy in past, previously on wait list for combined liver/kidney [**Month/Day (4) **] with MELD 29, CKD from diabetic nephrosclerosis, and DM2 is admitted with confusion for 10 days now with persistent ams.
# Altered mental status: Pt admitted initially with presumed hepatic encephalopathy as there was a history of decreased lactulose use.
Later he was found unresponsive and transferred to the MICU.
His mental status improved however he was noted to have persistent confusion and significant moter deficits in non-vascular distribution and word finding difficulties.
Multiple MRIs were performed which showed restricted diffusion in b/l cortices most consistent with hypoxic brain injury.
Due to the small volume only CMV PCR was sent which was negative.
#Seizure: He had a seizure during this hospitalization that was treated with IV ativan.
# Cirhosis: From hepatitis C, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and h/o varices, portal vein  thrombosis and ascites.
He was presumptively treated for hepatic encephalopathy as this was felt to be a component of his AMS.
However because of his mental deterioration he was de-activated and ultimately de-listed.
However, an [**Month/Day (4) 950**] showed patent portal veins and the decision was made that the risks of bleeding with continued anticoagulation outweighed the benfits and his warfarin was stopped.
# Respiratory status- On the evening of [**2196-3-9**] the patient was noted to become acutely dyspneic.
Chest xray was suggestive of lung collapse which was attributed to mucous plugging.
Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Altered mental staus Hepatic encephalopathy Possible hypoxic brain injury .
