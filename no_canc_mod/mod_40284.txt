Severe right axillary stenosis with pressure gradient indicating severe stenosis.
Successful PTA alone of right axillary stenosis with 4.0x20mm NC balloon and then 5.0x15mm NC balloon with 10% residual stenosis and virtual elimination of gradient.
Angiography of the right carotid confirmed a severe stenosis in the right internal carotid artery just after the bifurcation.
A 7.0mm [**Doctor Last Name **] Freedom embolic filter wire crossed the [**Country **] stenosis with minimal difficulty and was deployed distal to the stenosis.
The stenosis was predilated with a 2.5x20mm NC Quantum Apex MR balloon at 8 and 10 atms.
Transient hypertension and then hypotension treated with IVF and neosynephrine.
S/P right carotid stenting: Patient with 90% right carotid stenosis s/p stent [**9-21**].
Neuro examination stable without any gross motor or sensory defects.
# CAD:  Pt had non occlusive CAD of LCX at OM1 bifurcation of 70% and RCA chronically occluded with collaterals.
She was having intermittent episodes of [**4-10**] dull pain that is substernal, in both arms, and radiates through to back.
Her Atenolol was held while in-house due to bradycardia secondary to vagal stimulation after carotid stenting.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # Pump: NL EF at 70% on recent pharmacologic nuclear stress.
She was restarted on her Imdur before discharge, but her home Atenolol was held due to bradycardia.
# COPD: currently stable on RA, but was continued on her home Fluticasone-Salmeterol 250/50 IH [**Hospital1 **] and albuterol prn.
PCP can restart atenolol if bradycardia resolves.
