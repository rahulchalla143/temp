Admission Date:  [**2178-11-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2178-11-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2113-11-28**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Hepatobiliary Surgery Service HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64 year old male with a past medical history of ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis who was initially evaluated by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in the outpatient clinic on [**2178-10-14**].
By report, the patient has a history of jaundice requiring initial stent placement times three in [**2166**], with subsequent stent removal in [**2171**] and cholecystectomy in [**2172**].
Surveillance liver function study tests by the patient's primary care physician demonstrated an increased alkaline phosphatase earlier this year; follow-up endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was notable for minimally and common bile duct narrowing, consistent with primary sclerosing cholangitis.
The patient's liver function tests were noted to acutely worsen in [**2178-9-15**], with a subsequent second endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography conducted on [**2178-9-23**] which demonstrated distorted intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts and focal narrowing of the right, left and common hepatic duct near the cystic duct remnant.
PTC placement was attempted on [**2178-10-20**], at which point a right-sided drain was placed successfully, but a left-sided drain placement was complicated by biliary obstruction.
A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2178-10-21**] was notable for intrahepatic bile duct dilatation and atrophic left hepatic lobe.
A needle core biopsy conducted the same day demonstrated features consistent with primary sclerosing cholangitis and no evidence of malignancy.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was conducted on [**2178-10-22**] for investigation of an incidental CT finding of soft tissue density in the esophagus; this soft tissue was determined to be grade I varices at the lower one-third of the esophagus and at the gastroesophageal junction.
A repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2178-11-3**] demonstrated persistent varices with an additional finding of a hiatal hernia, antral gastritis, and a reactive inflammation of the mediastinal lymph nodes.
Ulcerative colitis.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Status post colonoscopy with colonic polyp removal.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No history of alcohol abuse, reportedly smoked a pack a day of cigarettes as a youth but quit approximately 40 years ago, no history of intravenous drug use, marijuana use, tatoos, hepatitis or pierced ears.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2178-11-9**], the patient underwent a left hepatic lobectomy, common bile duct excision, Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy to the right anterior hepatic duct and right posterior hepatic duct.
The patient tolerated the procedure well with an estimated blood loss of 1,400 intraoperatively.
Postoperatively, the patient was noted to be afebrile with stable vital signs.
The [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains, both medial and lateral, were noted to be intact and patent and right and left biliary drainage were noted to be intact and patent as well.
On postoperative day number two, the patient's nasogastric tube was discontinued without complication and the patient was subsequently noted to be ambulating well independently.
On the evening of postoperative day number two, the patient was noted to have transient elevations in temperature with a maximum temperature of 101.1.
At this point, his wound dressing was removed and his suture line examined; wound evaluation revealed a clean abdominal incision with intact staples with mild serous drainage from the floor right extent of the wound.
The patient also demonstrated mild pericarp-incisional erythema and subsequently had a vancomycin dosage increased to 1,21 mg every 12 hours for the duration of his stay.
Due to the timing of this fever episode in relation to the patient's transfusion schedule, it was felt that this fever was unlikely to be secondary to a transfusion reaction.
Two sets of blood cultures and one set of urinary cultures were subsequently obtained; as of the time of this dictation, the patient's urine culture demonstrated no growth and his blood cultures are still pending.
The patient continued to progress well clinically through postoperative day number five, at which point he was noted to be afebrile with stable vital signs.
His abdominal examination demonstrated a soft, nontender and nondistended abdomen; the patient's dressing was noted to be clean, dry and intact with no drainage or saturation.
Incisional examination demonstrated decreasing peri-incisional erythema with no evidence of active drainage and staples intact.
