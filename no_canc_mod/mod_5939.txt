HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, steroid-treated polymyalgia rheumatica, hypertension, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and high cholesterol who presented for a lower extremity peripheral angiography for bilateral foot ulcers, and he was found to an evaluated [**Year (4 digits) **] urea nitrogen, and creatinine, and potassium.
The patient notes he developed worsening foot pain and ulcers four months ago.
His foot ulcers continued to develop, and the patient complained of pain in his feet; primarily at night.
The patient was referred to for Vascular consultation because of the ulcerations and pain and scheduled for a lower extremity angiography on the day of admission, but due to his renal failure the procedure was cancelled.
The patient showed peaked T waves on electrocardiogram, and he was transferred to Medicine.
The patient denied any oliguria, hematuria, dysuria, foamy urine, flank pain, abdominal pain, or urinary hesitancy.
He has complained of fatigue, anorexia, and a 10-pound weight loss in the last four months.
He gets short of breath with one flight of stairs.
He denies any fevers, chills, recent infections, chest pain, orthopnea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia.
Diabetes mellitus times four years; recently started insulin and metformin due to his concurrent steroid use.
Polymyalgia rheumatica diagnosed four years ago; on steroids.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy, status post transurethral resection of prostate.
High cholesterol.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Type 1 diabetes in twin brother, type 2 diabetes in mother and brother.
Neck revealed no lymphadenopathy.
No thyromegaly.
No jugular venous distention.
A 2/6 systolic murmur at the upper sternal border.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally with faint lower lobe crackles on the left.
Back revealed no costovertebral angle tenderness.
The abdomen was soft and nontender.
No rebound or guarding.
No lower extremity edema.
Left foot with a dry crusted ulcer over the medial aspect of the first metatarsal head and the lateral posterior heel.
On the right foot dry crusted ulcer over the medial aspect of the first metatarsal head and medial posterior heel.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of diabetes, steroid-treated polymyalgia rheumatica, hypertension, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and high cholesterol without presented to the hospital for lower extremity angiograph; however, that was deferred due to new onset renal failure.
RENAL FAILURE:  The patient was initially thought to be prerenal, and his renal status improved after hydration and increased oral intake.
He did have a magnetic resonance angiography of his kidneys which showed mild right-sided renal artery stenosis.
His renal function fluctuated throughout his hospital stay, and when he was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit he did have decreased urine output in the setting of cardiogenic shock.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient with severe peripheral vascular disease.
During his hospital stay, he developed some nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
He also became hypotensive on [**5-23**] in the setting of infection.
The patient had a central line placed and went into sustained ventricular tachycardia that was treated with lidocaine.
After being treated with lidocaine, the patient became apneic requiring intubation and transfer to the Coronary Care Unit.
It was found that he had elevated troponins and likely an ischemic event on the [**5-23**].
A repeat echocardiogram showed a decreased ejection fraction from prior.
The patient continued to have intermittent episodes of ventricular tachycardia.
He was noted to be cardiogenic shock requiring pressors.
Of note, he likely suffered a second ischemic event during his Coronary Care Unit stay.
The patient did have a Swan-Ganz catheter in place and had a low cardiac output.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was initially treated with levofloxacin for a left lower lobe infiltrate and a urinary tract infection.
He then developed positive [**Year (4 digits) **] cultures with Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to levofloxacin, and that was continued.
When the patient became hypotensive and required intubation and pressors, his antibiotics were broadened, and he was put on stress-dose steroids.
He was found to have bilateral Staphylococcus pneumonia.
PULMONARY:  The patient required intubation in the setting of hypotension and ventricular tachycardia.
He was also found to have a bilateral Staphylococcus pneumonia.
