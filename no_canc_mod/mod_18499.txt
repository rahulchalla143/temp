Carotid ultrasound showed no evidence of extensive disease.
However, the patient had a CVA on the left an unknown number of years ago leaving him with mild paresthesias and left upper extremity weakness.

RADIOLOGIC AND OTHER STUDIES:  Preoperative carotid series showed normal antegrade flow in the vertebral arteries bilaterally and mild plaque in the prophylaxis internal carotid arteries bilaterally with less than of 40% hemodynamic stenosis.
A MRI at the previous hospital showed a high-grade left carotid stenosis.
Persantine thallium on [**5-25**] showed a fixed defect apical/inferior left wall with a LVEF of 42%.
Preoperative chest x-ray also showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
The patient remained in a sinus rhythm in the 60s with no ectopy without any temperature.
On the 31st he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 4 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with a LIMA to the LAD, a vein graft to the diagonal, a vein graft to the PLV branch, and voiding to the PDA.

He continued to have decreased breath sounds at the bases.
