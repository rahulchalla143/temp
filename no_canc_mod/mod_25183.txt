There is a left basal effusion with atelectasis in the left lower lobe.
The right lung does not show any focal consolidations.
CONCLUSION: Left basal effusion with atelectasis in the left lower lobe, though focal consolidation cannot be excluded and followup is advised.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 2392**] is a 71yo female with PMH significant for ESRD on HD, anemia, respiratory failure s/p tracheostomy who is being transferred to the MICU for LGIB.
Per her PMH, she has a history of GI bleeding.
Differential diagnosis for LGIB includes hemmoroids, diverticuliosis, angiodysplasia, colitis (infectious, ischemia, IBD, and neoplasm.
No report of fevers, chills, or diarrhea to suggest an infectious colitis or IBD.
Most likely diverticulitis vs. hemorrhoids.
Per OMR, she has not had a colonoscopy here.
Her INR and PTT are elevated today.
She is on Aspirin as an outpatient but is not on any anti-coagulation (in light of history of atrial fibrillation).
GI consult was obtained and given spontaneous resolution of bleeding and low expectation for intervation, colonoscopy was not pursued.
No fevers or chills to suggest an underlying infectious process.
Lactate was elevated to 3.9 but quickly returned to [**Location 213**].
Her hypotension also resolved upon tranfer to the MICU.
3)Respiratory: Patient has history of respiratory failure s/p tracheostomy and was successfully weaned in [**1-11**].
Patient was acutely hypoxic with O2 saturation between 50-70%.
No evidence of a pneumonia on cxray.
Patient had a single, transient episode of desaturation wich resolved with suctioning.
4)Coagulopathy: Patient presented with elevated INR and PTT.
Hct on admission was 35, which is slightly elevated from baseline.
