Fever w/u included CXR-unremarkable, labs notable for amylase/lipase 1078/457 respectively.
Conservative management of pancreatitis, surgery consulted and aggreed to continue conservative management of pancreatitis w/IVF resuscitation, NPO and pain control.
Family History: unknown  Physical Exam: VS: 103.4 Rectally, 182/89 110 24 100%2LNC GEN: Arousable, not interactive HEENT: PERRL, Anicteric sclera, Dry MM, cracked tongue, no cervical LAD RESP: CTA b/l antly, no wheezing CV: Reg Nml S1, S2, no M/R/G ABD: Soft ND/NT, significantly diminished BS, guarding, no rebound EXT: No peripheral edema, warm, 2+DP pulses b/l NEURO: Arousable, does not follow commands, normal reflexes, downgoing toes b/l   Pertinent Results: IMAGING: OSH: CXR--No PNA/PTX/CHF ABD U/S--Limited study due to motion; multiple stones in GB ABD CT--Moderate inflammatory changes RUQ>LUQ; Minimal peripancreatic inflammation around head/body of pancreas .
IMAGING: [**11-16**] CXR: There are no old films available for comparison.
The heart is mildly enlarged.
The hemidiaphragms are poorly visualized suggesting bilateral pleural effusions.
There is bilateral lower lobe volume loss.
Some mildly dilated loops of bowel are seen in the abdomen.
Fluid overload with bilateral pleural effusions and vascular plethora.
[**11-16**] RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND:  Limited views of the liver demonstrate no focal or textural abnormalities.
Small stones and sludge are seen within a nondistended gallbladder.
There is no gallbladder wall edema or adjacent pericholecystic fluid to indicate acute cholecystitis.
No ascites is seen in the right upper quadrant.
Limited views of the right kidney demonstrate no hydronephrosis or calculi.
Cholelithiasis and sludge without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
No biliary ductal dilatation.
No evidence of acute intracranial pathology, including no sign of hemorrhage.
Chronic small vessel infarction as described above.
Overall limited examination; however, no definite evidence of pulmonary embolus to the segmental level.
Extensive severe pancreatitis with no definite evidence of pancreatic necrosis.
Due to extensive inflammatory changes, the patient is at risk for sequela of severe pancreatitis including necrosis and vascular complications.
Bilateral pleural effusions and compression atelectasis with no definite evidence of pneumonia.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve  leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally  normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Cannot exclude a regioanl wall motion  abnormality due to technical limitations.
Fevers: Fevers to 103.2 on presentation raised concern for SIRS vs. biliary sepsis in the setting of pancreatitis and E-coli UTI, elevated lactate, and leukocytosis.
She was initially treated with meropeneum empirically for biliary infection possibility.
Upon improvement of pancreatitis, meropenem changed to cipro for pansensitive e. coli UTI on [**2126-11-9**].=, however, she developed another positive UA on this regimen and began spiking fevers again, therefore this was changed to ceftazadime on [**2126-11-22**].
A CT chest showed b/l pulm infiltrates, but no PNA.
She was treated conservatively with IVF, NPO and pain control.
A repeat CT showed extensive and severe  pancreatitis, but no sign of necrosis.
Delta MS/Dementia: Multifactorial in setting of infectious process, resolved with improvement of acute issues.
A head CT was done to rule out acute intracranial processes; it revealed atrophy along with enlargement of the ventricals out of proportion to the degree of atrophy.
She was noted to have worsening pulmonary edema by CXR despite diuresis at the OSH.
The patient's PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**]; the patient has no documented history of CHF (though no recent echo and on standing lasix as outpatient).
Bilateral pleural effusions were noted on Chest CT (negative for PNA or PE).
A TTE was performed to assess for CHF which showed low normal EF.
HTN: Pt's HTN managed with metoprolol; this was initially held due to her tenuous original status w/SIRS.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] Of [**Location (un) 5176**]  Discharge Diagnosis: pancreatitis pulmonary edema hypertension hypothyroidism fever   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: please take your medication as directed  please call your physician if you develop fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhea as these may suggest a serious condition.
