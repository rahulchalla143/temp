Possible left anterior fascicular block.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
CTP is generally more sensitive than CT/CTA for infarction.
However, given the history of MS, an MR is more sensitive for acute infarct.
Chronic white matter changes consistent with demyelinating disease.
Interval improvement of left frontal edema.
EEG ([**9-9**]): IMPRESSION: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured no clinical or electrographic seizures.
EEG reflects low amplitude diffuse slowing with overlaying fast activity likely secondary to medications.
Superimposed on almost the entire recording is the presence of muscle artifact.
This EEG is most consistent with a moderate to severe encephalopathy.
If clinical suspicion for seizure persists, another day of EEG telemetry may be beneficial to further delineate any focal findings which may be obscured with encephalopathies.
New demyelinating plaques seen in the right cerebellar hemisphere and brainstem, both of which enhance.
In the supratentorial white matter, there are scattered areas of new enhancing plaques, while others have resolved when compared to the prior examination.
This is superimposed on a background of diffuse demyelinating disease in the supratentorial white matter.
CXR ([**9-17**]): IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
EEG ([**9-18**]): IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to the left frontal and hemispheric slowing including of the background.
This suggests a focal subcortical dysfunction in the left hemisphere.
The episode of focal faster activity in the left temporal area was of uncertain nature.
No definitely epileptiform abnormalities were evident.
CT Head ([**9-18**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.
No evidence of hemorrhage.
Chronic white matter changes, considering the clinical history, most likely consistent with demyelinating disease.
Seizures with Post-Ictal [**Doctor Last Name 555**] Paralysis: The patient is a 43 year old woman with a history of secondary progressive MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 54182**], bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, and baseline bilateral lower extremity paresis who presented with 3 GTC seizures, and was then found to have new onset left sided weakness.
A code stroke was called in the ED for new onset left sided weakness after the last seizure (of note, she has at baseline bilateral inferior limb paresis and right hemibody paresis).
Physical exam on admission showed decreased arousal, left face and arm weakness, and decreased reflexes in the legs (previously documented).
CTA on admission showed no acute intracranial abnormality.
EEG [**Date range (1) 54183**] showed moderate to severe encephalopathy, but no evidence of seizure.
Her progressive MS was determined to be the most likely cause of her seizures, especially since the hyperintensities on MRI extended past the grey-white junction.
Her post-seizure left sided weakness was determined to be [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 555**] paralysis, and was not consistent with a stroke.
She was initially on Keppra, but this was discontinued when she had altered mental status.
Secondary Progressive MS: MRI Head/MRA brain showed new demyelinating plaques in the right cerebellar hemisphere and brainstem.
It was determined that since the hyperintensities on MRI extended past the grey-white junction, this was likely the cause of her seizures.
Her Topamax and Amytriptyline were discontinued given her altered mental status.
While the patient was on the Neurology floor, she continued to have altered mental status including disorientation to place and date, and uncooperativity with the physical exam.
CT Head showed no acute intracranial abnormality.
CXR showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
Repeat EEG showed left frontal and hemispheric slowing including of the background suggesting a focal subcortical dysfunction in the left hemisphere.
However, there were no definitely epileptiform abnormalities evident.
Her change in mental statue was attributed to UTI and medications; but this may also be a new baseline for her given the progressive nature of her MS.  4.
UTI: Urine culture on [**9-12**] showed no growth.
However, a UA and urine culture were rechecked on [**9-19**] for her persistent altered mental status, which showed UA: sm leuk, neg nitr, 18 WBC, few bact.

You had a lumbar puncture which did not show any bacteria or viruses.
You were found to have a urinary tract infection, and are being treated with 10 days of antibiotics.
Your mental status fluctuated during this hospitalization, and you may be at a new baseline mental status.
You are being treated with Bactrim twice a day for urinary tract infection to complete a 10 day course.
If you develop further seizures, changes in your mental status, increased weakness or numbness, difficulty speaking or swallowing, fevers or chills, or any other symptoms that concern you, call your PCP or return to the ED.
