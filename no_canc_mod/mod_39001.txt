No change of the baseline ventriculomegaly.
No shift of normally midline structures.
Persistent moderate chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
No additional sites of intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
No acute fracture.
Small right posterior parietal scalp hematoma.
CTA head [**12-25**]  IMPRESSION: No vascular abnormalities or aneurysms identified to explain patient's intraventricular hemorrhage.
Intraventricular hemorrhage is noted.
No acute cervical fracture or malalignment.
Moderate degenerative changes, most noted at C5-6 and 7 level, with small posterior osteophyte causing mild canal narrowing.
The patient has slightly increased risk of cord injury even in the event of small trauma.
CT head [**2146-12-27**]: Evaluation is slightly limited due to patient motion.
A large intraventricular hemorrhage in the right ventricle extending through the frontal, occipital, and temporal horns and third ventricle is again seen, unchanged in size and extent.
A small amount of layering hemorrhage in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] remains stable.
No new areas of hemorrhage are noted.
Prominent areas of hypodensity within the periventricular white matter likely represent a combination of sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic changes and transependymal migration of CSF, stable in extent since the recent study.
The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells remain clear.
A small right parietal scalp hematoma is resolving.
IMPRESSION: Large intraventricular hemorrhage involving the entire right lateral ventricle, the third ventricle, and a small amount of layering hemorrhage in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] remains stable.
No new areas of hemorrhage seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 yo W with HTN, multifactorial gait disorder and multiple recent falls, asymptomatic ventriculomegaly, remote h/o seizures, h/o subdural hemorrhage after MVA [**2144**], afib on coumadin, OA, s/p hip replacement brought to ED after being found on the floor of her kitchen and being confused and found to have large R intraventricular hemorrhage.
NEURO:  She was admitted to Neuro ICU for monitoring.
She was treated with HOB elevation, maintentance of SBP in 120-140 range and bedrest.
At time of admission she was awake/alert but inattentive with with slight Left Tri/WE and IP/H weakness.
Although the most likely diagnosis was the post-traumatic hemorrhage a CTA was performed to rule out AVM, or anneurysm (this was negative).
There was no evidence of hydrocephalus.
On the floor she did well and her headache improved.
She remains somewhat inattentive and perseverative but overall she is more alert and oriented to her surroundings.
Due to fall she was assessed for Cspine fracture with a negative CT and was clinically cleared by the SICU team.

You were found to have a large bleed into the ventricles of your brain (compartments within your brain where spinal fluid flows).
This was felt to be due to a fall and being on coumadin.
You coumadin will be held until the intraventricular bleed has been completely resolved and your risk of falling has been re-evaluated.
With this treatment, your symptoms and bleed improved.
You still had some confusion but your headache improved.
coumadin has been stopped  Should you develop any of the warning signs below, or any other symptom concerning to you, please call your doctor or go to the emergency room  Followup Instructions: PRIMARY CARE Provider: [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10491**], MD Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 10492**] Date/Time:[**2147-1-16**] 2:15  NEUROLOGY: You have an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], on Tuesday [**2-7**] @ 4:00pm, this is at the [**Hospital1 69**] - [**Hospital Ward Name 5074**], in the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Center on the [**Location (un) **], phone number: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 7394**].
