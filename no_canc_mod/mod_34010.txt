Irrigation and debridement left Morel lesion thigh and flank.
[**2142-6-18**] Circumferential debridement from the gluteal fold to the ankle of the skin, subcutaneous tissue of left leg with the proximal control of the saphenous vein and application of dressing.
[**2142-6-19**] Debridement of the left leg with vac placement [**2142-6-25**] Debridement of the left leg  History of Present Illness: 59 year old male who was riding his motorcycle.
Helmet was intact but unknown loss of conscience.
He sustained multiple injuries: - large degloving injury to left leg - L proximal fibula nondisplaced fracture - R elbow abrasion that enters olecranon bursa - L scapular body fracture - R lateral rib fx 3,4,5,6 - L non-displaced buckling rib fx 4,5,6 - Spinous process fractures T8-11 - L eyebrow laceration   Past Medical History: Alcohol use, although no recent abuse known.
Cirrhosis, portal hypertension, without known hepatitis C status  Social History: divorced x2 but supportive girlfriend, family in area.
Pertinent Results: [**2141-6-16**]: CT Head: No intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.
CT C-spine: Mid-cervical spondylosis, without fracture or listhesis CT Abdomen and Pelvis: 1.
Multiple osseous injuries including bilateral rib fractures and lower thoracic spinous process fractures.
Left scapular inferior body fracture also noted.
Cirrhosis with splenomegaly, suggesting portal hypertension.
Right basilar consolidation more likely represents atelectasis than aspiration.
Chronically occluded left common iliac artery, with reconstitution of the left external iliac artery.
[**2142-6-25**] Abdominal Ultrasound: No ascites in upper abdomen.
Pneumatosis coli of the ascending, descending, and sigmoid colon.
Intraluminal air also within portions of the distal small bowel.
While ischemia is in the differential, given that the patient is intubated and has a significant amount of subcutaneous air secondary to trauma, the etiology maybe non- ischemic.
Multiple fractures as described above including probable nondisplaced fracture of the right acetabulum.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 19484**] is a 58 year-old man with no confirmed medical history who was admitted to trauma ICU [**2142-6-15**] after a motorcycle crash on the early morning of the same day.
He was thrown 50 feet from his motorcycle after collision with automobile, was wearing a helmet, but sustained multiple injuries: - large degloving injury to left leg - L proximal fibula nondisplaced fracture - R elbow abrasion that enters olecranon bursa - L scapular body fracture - R lateral rib fx 3,4,5,6 - L non-displaced buckling rib fx 4,5,6 - Spinous process fractures T8-11 - L eyebrow laceration    On [**2142-6-15**] patient went to the OR for two procedures.
First procedure was for an exposed right elbow joint.
The second procedure was irrigation and debridement of a left Morel-[**Doctor Last Name 83285**] lesion ("A variant of a true open fracture is an extensive lumbosacral fascial degloving injury similar to that described in Morel-[**Doctor Last Name 83285**] syndrome") of the pelvis, lower torso, thigh.
Repeat CT scan on the day of admission of his abdomen and pelvis due to his hypotension which was negative for injury or any source of bleeding.
On [**2142-6-18**] he was taken back to the OR for further debridement of necrotic skin and subcutaneous tissue (entirety of skin excised) from gluteal fold to ankle, with wet to dry dressing placed.
[**2142-6-19**] he returned to the OR for further debridement, washout and placement of a wound vac.
He continued to have high output (>3 Liters/daily) throughout the hospital stay.
Patient developed a rigid abdomen and had a bladder pressure of 34.
Bladder pressure decreased to 15 after a large bowel movement.
[**2142-6-26**] Concern that the leg was causing sepsis patient went to the OR for leg debridement and washout of the left lower extremity.
He then got a CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis which showed Pneumatosis coli of the ascending, descending, and sigmoid colon.
At this point it was felt that he had non-survivable injuries.
