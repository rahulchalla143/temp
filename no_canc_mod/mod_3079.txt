INDICATIONS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 17327**] is a 60-year-old woman, with severe COPD on high-dose steroids for exacerbation, who came in with increasing abdominal pain over a 24-hour period.
She had an upright chest film that showed free air.
She was tachycardiac and had peritonitis on physical exam.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  An upper midline incision was made with a #10 blade scalpel.
There were no adhesions from a previous cesarean section.
There was purulent material in the upper quadrants as well as the lower quadrants.
There was a hole in the anterior wall of the duodenum.
The abdomen was then further explored, and there was no further bleeding, or fluid to remove.
The the patient was then transferred to the ICU, intubated, given her poor pulmonary status preoperatively.
Specimens to pathology were anterior abdominal free-floating fatty mass.
Swallow Study:  BEDSIDE SWALLOWING EVALUATION:  HISTORY: Thank you for consulting on this 60 y/o female with CAD (s/p MI x2 and stent '[**93**] and '[**01**]) and COPD on home O2 who woke up with severe abdominal pain causing SOB and left shoulder pain resolved who was found with perforated duodenal ulcer and peritonitis.
She was transferred to the floor and advanced to clear liquids which she appeared to be tolerating well, but went into respiratory distress and a code was called on [**8-3**].
CXR showed "new bilateral effusions present.
There are increased interstitial markings in the left lung and at the right base with sparing of the right upper lung field, suggesting asymmetrical CHF."
Repeat on [**8-6**] showed "Slight interval increase in atelectasis and overlying effusion at the left lung base."
The pt today reported she can have difficulty swallowing when she tries to take several sips in a row, likely due to her COPD/SOB.
She denied any difficulty swallowing while on the floor.
Speech and voice were wfl and was able to follow all basic commands.
Palatal elevation was symmetrical, no gag.
Oral transit was timely and without oral residue.
The pt did not have any overt coughing, throat clearing or changes in vocal quality and she denied the sensation of aspiration or food stuck in her throat.
Laryngeal elevation was timely and wfl to palpation, however pt reported consecutive sips were "harder."
CXRs following her respiratory arrest do not appear to indicate aspiration from oral and pharyngeal dysphagia, but cannot rule out aspiration from reflux / tube feedings from this evaluation.
If there are any further concerns for oral and pharyngeal dysphagia / aspiration, we would be happy to take the pt for a video swallow.
Single  sips of thin liquid only.
If there are any further concerns for oral and pharyngeal dysphagia / aspiration, we would be happy to take the pt for a video swallow.
Her chest xray showed free air under the diaphragm.
In the operating room she was found to have a perforated duodenal ulcer.
Her ulcer was repaired and [**Location (un) **]-patched; a gastrojejunostomy tube was placed.
Because of her compromised pulmonary status prior to surgery she remained intubated post-procedure and was taken to the ICU for further care.
Hydrocortisone was provided for adrenal support as she was on high-dose steroids prior to admission for COPD exacerbation.
However, her WBC count was still elevated at 17.6 and we continued to await bowel function.
Primary care medicine saw her and wrote a brief note in agreement with current low dose steroid treatment and recommended increased bronchodilator treatment, which was followed.
On POD 6 she was reported to have a short episode of ventricular tachycardia while walking.
Cardiac enzymes and EKG were evaluated and were negative for ischemic event.
A post intubation chest xray showed small bilateral effusions, pulmonary edema, and no evidence of pneumothorax.
The ECHO showed no acute changes from previous ECHO of [**2202-5-17**].
Her EKG showed mild demand ischemia and cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated from 0.03 to 0.09.
Cardiology evaluated her and felt that despite her elevated troponin, her benign ECHO results did not support a deterioration related to acute coronary syndrome.
On POD 8 a right upper extremity ultrasound was performed to rule out DVT as her arm was swollen.
On POD 9 her respiratory culture was positive for pseudomonas and her antibiotic therapy was changed to Zosyn.
At this point her tube feeds were started back, metoprolol was added for cardiac protection, and Lasix was provided as needed to prevent pulmonary edema.
The primary team left a note that mentioned a chronic elevated WBC count that would not likely normalize.
On POD 12 she was afebrile and doing better.
A chest xray was performed to assess for interval change which showed bilateral moderate pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis, unchanged from the prior radiograph.
She was able to swallow her medications without problems.
She had several episodes of loose stool and this was sent for c. difficile which was negative.
