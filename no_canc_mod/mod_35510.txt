No new pulmonary emboli.
Small resolving pulmonary emboli in the lower lobes bilaterally, right middle lobe, and left upper lobe, smaller than the prior CTA of the chest [**2181-7-12**].
Increasing mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy of unclear etiology.
Two small pulmonary nodules measuring 3 and 6 mm in the right lung, the larger of which is likely related to atelectasis and unchanged from recent prior exam.
Right lower extremity nonocclusive DVT involving the right external iliac, common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins.
No left-sided deep venous thrombosis.
Pt denies having Chest pain at all, however he is not a could historian and is unclear of his presenting symptoms.
Unable to do stress test at this time, can not exercise (fall risk), reluctant to do dobutamine in setting of ACS, Persantine contraindicated in COPD exacerbation.
Will need chemical stress when COPD treatment complete likely after pt d/c to rehab.
Multifactorial, including systolic CHF (EF 30-35%), PE, COPD exacerbation.
CHF management, as below.
For COPD exacerbation, finished steroid taper 8/21(2nd day 20mg), nebs, levofloxacin [**6-16**] day course.
Pt clinically improved since out of CCU, breathing unlabored, lungs with decreased crackles .
# PUMP/ acute on chronic systolic CHF: [**7-16**] echo moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with sveere hypokinesis of the basal to mid septum and anterior wall, EF 30-35%.
severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Depressed EF likely [**2-10**] CAD given focal abnormailites.
Had incrased lasix to 60 PO daily with one additional 10IV lasix dose in setting of increased crackles.
Lasix stoped for 2 days now, had bolus IVF, with improved BP and Cr and crackles on lung exam has also diminished.
Pt was orthostatic [**8-28**] with SBP to 80, improved BP with boluses .
Recent for DVT and PE unclear.
Distant h/o Prostate CA.
There was concern that the PE lead to the [**Month (only) 7792**] and SOB/COPD flare.
Pt was on heparin gtt until [**8-29**], as Warfarin became theraputic.
# Metabolic alkalosis: ABG gotten [**8-29**] because of high HCO3 and inapropriate question answering [**8-29**].
No GI losses noted.
Etiology of lactate elevation unclear, likely [**2-10**] recent MI or DVT/PE.
No evidence of infection.
#Eosinophilia - present for 2 months, now downtrending since starting steroids.
Dx includes Neoplasm (as above, needs screening), undiagnosed asthma?, adrenal insufficiency (no e/o hypotension or hypoglycemia, but has evidence of adrenal disease on ct scan with normocytic anemia), connective tissue disease, sacrdoidosis, parasites (do not know travel history).
CTA did show Increasing mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy of unclear etiology which needs 6 month f/u.
[**Month (only) 116**] work up for connective tissue disorders as an outpt.
Ddx includes steroid or unit induceed delirium, or Wernickes considering significant Etoh history.
# ARF: Cr trending down from 1.7 to 1.4 (.9 to 1.0 baseline).
Felt to be prerenal since downtrending with decreased diuresis and hydration.
# GERD - PPI .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] Of [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Non ST elevation MI ([**Location (un) 7792**]) systolic congestive heart failure acute renal failure aortic stenosis - moderate to severe mulitiple Pulmonary Embolism - R-upper/R-middle lobe artery, ext mural thrombus aortic arch and descending abdominal aorta RLE Deep Vein Thrombosis Prostate CA s/p radiation Hypercholesterolemia COPD - unknown pfts, on albuterol med list at-home Hx ETOH abuse GERD   Discharge Condition: stable: [**Location (un) 7792**] medically managed, needs stress test once COPD exacerbation controled.
PE resolving, s/p IVC filter.
CHF controled but needs further management of lasix dose.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you were short of breath and were confused at home.
You were found to have a heart attack ([**Doctor Last Name 7792**]) and be in heart failure (CHF) which contributed to your shortness of breath.
We are treating your heart attack and heart failure with medicines.
You were found to have a blood clot in your right leg (DVT) as well as your lungs (pulmonary embolus) on your previous admission to the hospital.
Therefore you got a IVC filter placed in your vein to prevent future clots in your lungs.
You are at increased risk for seriously bleeding becuase of blood thinner if you fall.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight increases > 3 lbs.
If you became acutely short of breath or develop chest pain you should return to the Emergency room.
Also showed discuss your eosinophia.
You should discuss the need for a stress test to evaluate your heart disease at that time.
