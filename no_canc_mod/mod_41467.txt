On transfer to the floor, patient was afebrile at 97.8, heart rate of 86, a blood pressure of 104/51, respiratory rate of 20, and 96% on 2 liters.
Her HEENT:  She had right frontal resolving bruising with some minor abrasions.
No tenderness over her sinuses.
Her mucous membranes were moist.
Her cardiovascular examination is irregularly, irregular, no murmurs or rubs were appreciated.
Her pulmonary exam with diffuse inspiratory and expiratory rhonchi, crackles were at the bases bilaterally left greater than right.
Her abdomen had normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, and nondistended, no masses, and no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  Trace edema in her lower extremities to mid calves bilaterally.
Sepsis:  This 87-year-old female, who had a recent MRSA UTI, history of multiple aspirations, had recently been partially treated for a urinary tract infection versus aspiration pneumonia, which was seen on her initial chest x-ray.
The patient was continued on vancomycin and Zosyn for coverage of Staph epi bacteremia and pneumonia with MRSA in the sputum.
She continued on Zosyn for several more days and then was transferred to levo and Flagyl for further treatment of her pneumonia.
Explorations for further sources of sepsis were all negative.
Her urine culture was no growth.
A repeat P-A and lateral chest x-ray on [**2105-4-6**] did show bilateral patchy opacities, which could be consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
Given the verification, the patient did have bilateral patchy opacities.
A decision was made to treat the patient as if she had aspiration pneumonia with sputum that did grow MRSA.
Blood cultures on [**3-24**] did not grow out any infection and the blood cultures from [**4-3**] also were no growth to date.
In addition, if the patient spikes a temperature or becomes febrile after discontinuing her two week course of antibiotics, the team felt it would be wise at that time to obtain a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out endocarditis more accurately.
The patient did have a transthoracic echocardiogram during this hospital stay, which did not show any evidence of vegetations.
FEN:  The patient has a history of multiple prior aspiration pneumonias.
She will be treated for a 14 day course of antibiotics on the presumed diagnosis of repeat aspiration pneumonia.
Congestive heart failure:  The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure.
On her chest x-ray, she did have some evidence of congestive heart failure, however, her oxygen saturations remained stable throughout this hospital stay.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS/PRIMARY:  Aspiration pneumonia, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus lung infection complicated by sepsis.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Diastolic congestive heart failure.
as needed for dry nose.
prn shortness of breath or wheezing.
