Patient reports that two nights prior to admission, she developed a diffuse left lower abdominal pain at dinner time.
She initially thought it was due to constipation.
The pain did not radiate anywhere.
The pain improved somewhat by the following morning and she went to work, only to realize that she was feeling more ill and thus presented to the ED.
Patient denied dysuria, hematuria, blood in the stool.
No cough, headache, vomiting, or diarrhea.
Of note, she had similar abdominal pain two weeks ago which spontaneously resolved.
Labs were notable for a marked leukocytosis to 7.2 (baseline wbc 1.5-2 from SLE) with 51% bands, mild hyponatremia of 132, lactate of 2.9, and anemia with Hct of 34.8 compared to recent baseline of ~37.
CT abdomen/pelvis showed left proximal ureteric stone with mild hydronephrosis on ultrasound.
Urology was consulted and recommended percutaneous nephrostomy tube versus ureteral stent, and patient chose the former.
She was alert and oriented, expressing [**4-26**] pain, tachycardic to the 120s, hypertensive to the 160s, and in some mild discomfort.

Imaging/diagnostics: - CXR ([**2178-6-18**]): No acute intrathoracic process.
- Renal ultrasound ([**2178-6-18**]): Mild left hydronephrosis, source not identified on this study.
- CT abdomen/pelvis ([**2178-6-18**]):  7 x 4 mm proximal to mid left ureteral stone with mild to moderate left hydronephrosis and left perinephric stranding.
2-3 mm stone in the inferior pole of the left kidney.
Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2178-6-19**]):       GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN CLUSTERS.
Brief Hospital Course: 43 yo F with systemic lupus erythematosus with leukopenia, recurrent UTIs, presents with high fevers and abdominal pain, found to have infected ureteral calculus, now s/p percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement, hemodynamically stable.
# Pyelonephritis/sepsis: On admission, patient had high fevers, chills, leukocytosis with bandemia.
CT abdomen showed left proximal ureteric stone with mild hydronephrosis.
Blood cultures grew out pan-sensitive Proteus and urine culture grew pan-sensitive Proteus.
No obvious hematuria and signs or symptoms to suggest hematoma around the nephrostomy site.
Unlikely to be HIT but heparin stopped nevertheless and patient placed on fondaparinux given positive anticardiolipin antiboties.
# Systemic lupus erythematosus: Diagnosed in [**2171**] when she presented with repeated bounts of leukopenia (baseline WBC 1.5 - 2) during pregnancy as well as spontaneous DVTs.
# Depression: Stable.
