High dose steroids were given initially for possible tracheal edema exacerbating her tracheal narrowing and causing her current symptoms.
During her MICU stay she continued to have episodes of SOB/Stridor/cough/nausea which were attributed to her tracheal obstruction and responded to Ventolin and lidocaine inhalation, antiemetics and reassurance.
