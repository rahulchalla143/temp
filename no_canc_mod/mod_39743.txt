CV: On POD#1, the patient experienced atrial fibrillation with RVR with a troponin bump to 0.14.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.

The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
Midline surgical incision with staples remained clean and intact.
