Admission Date:  [**2125-1-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2125-1-20**]  Date of Birth:   [**2058-8-10**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old woman with history of CAD status post CABG in '[**15**] with peripheral vascular disease and inflammatory bowel disease causing chronic diarrhea who is presenting with hypotension and hypoxemia.
The patient had roughly two weeks' history of lightheadedness with standing in context of her usual [**6-17**] bowel movements and decreased appetite, nausea, and vomiting.
She also complained of intermittent chills, but no fevers, some fatigue, but no syncope.
No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no change in chronic cough.
No change in urinary symptoms.
She was administered 4 liters of normal saline over several hours with increase in blood pressure to 105/50 and subsequently developed hypoxemia, orthopnea, and CHF by chest x-ray.
Echocardiogram by wet read showed an ejection fraction of 30% and patient's CT reread as no retroperitoneal air and cleared by surgery.
She was admitted to the MICU for further evaluation of hypotension and CHF.
Coronary artery disease status post CABG in '[**15**].
Status post MI in '[**15**].
Peripheral vascular disease status post bilateral iliac artery stents.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies except to aloe and lanolin.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for 40 pound weight loss over the past four months.
In general:  She was a pale appearing woman alert, awake, oriented in mild respiratory distress speaking in fragmented sentences, profoundly orthopneic.
Neck with jugular venous pressure about 12 cm, supple neck, no lymphadenopathy, no masses.
Cardiovascular is regular, rate, and rhythm with frequent premature beats, normal S1, S2, 3/6 systolic murmur at the left sternal base.
Lungs with poor air movement bilaterally worse at lung bases, no rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.
Neurologic examination:  Is moving all extremities symmetrically, no facial asymmetry.
CT of the abdomen showed thickened walls of the colon, sigmoid colon and rectum.
There was no free air or fluid, positive gallstones, extensive vascular calcifications, question of a small internal hernia.
Chest x-ray with mild CHF.
Echocardiogram with an EF of 30% with 2+ MR, anterior distal septal, apical lateral, and inferior hypokinesis, akinesis, mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
EKG initially was normal sinus rhythm at 55, new biphasic T's in V1, T-wave inversions in V3 and V4, V5, I, and aVL, and poor R-wave progression.
Repeat normal sinus rhythm at 61 with no acute changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 66-year-old woman with history of CAD status post MI, status post CABG with peripheral vascular disease and history of chronic diarrhea, who presents hypotensive and hypoxemic.
Hypoxemia:  Patient's hypoxemia initially was attributed to CHF exacerbation with fluid overload.
Recent decrease in ejection fraction down to 30-35% per this echocardiogram.
With this acute change in her ejection fraction with her mitral regurgitation and elevated troponins and history of coronary artery disease, patient was evaluated by Cardiology and eventually taken for a cardiac catheterization, where she had three stents placed from her saphenous vein graft to her LAD.
Her coronary catheterization showed severe three vessel disease and an ejection fraction of 34%.
Patient remained chest pain free throughout the course of her stay, but did have severe cardiac disease as evidenced on the catheterization.
Also related to her hypoxemia with her decreased ejection fraction, the patient was in CHF.
At time of discharge, the patient was able to lie flat without orthopnea and was not requiring oxygen.
Patient did have evidence of hyperinflation on chest x-ray and has a long smoking history, although this may not have been previously diagnosed, patient probably has baseline oxygen saturations around 94%.
Patient was otherwise stable from a respiratory standpoint and did not complain of shortness of breath or dyspnea on exertion.
Patient's history of COPD and recent increase in ischemic cardiac disease were all likely contributing factors to patient going into new AFib four days into her admission.
Patient had one episode of chest tightness and EKG at that time showed patient was in AFib with a rate of 146.
Patient's rate was controlled with metoprolol and patient's discomfort immediately improved.
Patient however, remained in atrial fibrillation rhythm until she was d-c cardioverted on [**1-16**].
Patient's rhythm remains stable, and patient was only continued on her beta blocker for her rhythm and Coumadin.
Patient will likely have to continue Coumadin initially for three weeks, but possibly life long which is because of increased risk of atrial fibrillation.
Patient was also noted after cardioversion and after cardiac catheterization to have episodes of NSVT going up to 12-13 beats.
These were all asymptomatic, however, the frequency of these episodes were concerning, and patient was evaluated by the Electrophysiology department and plans were made to return in one month's time to have an Electrophysiology study and likely placement of a defibrillator and AICD because of concerns for ischemic cardiomyopathy with NSVT.
Otherwise for patient's coronary artery disease, she was continued on beta blocker, transitioned to a Toprol XL regimen because of new CHF.
Colitis:  Patient with history of chronic diarrhea since [**Month (only) 547**] of this year with initial thoughts of just inflammatory bowel disease.
Patient with increased amounts of diarrhea prior to this visit likely resulting in dehydration and hypotension on arrival.
Biopsy taken, granularity edema, loss of vascularity, and ulceration in the rectum and sigmoid colon compatible with colitis and overall appearance was more consistent with Crohn's disease.
Patient had pathology of the biopsies which were consistent with chronic active colitis.
To rule out ischemic colitis, patient had a MRI/MRA done of her abdomen which showed multifocal stenoses of the superior mesenteric artery seen, but there appeared to be good collaterals provided via the transverse pancreatic artery to pancreatic branches from the SMA.
There was no significant disease of the celiac access or the [**Female First Name (un) 899**].
There was some renal artery stenosis of the superior right renal artery as well as the main left renal artery.
Small bilateral pleural effusions were also seen and subcentimeter hemorrhagic cysts within the kidneys were seen bilaterally.
Also noted to have multiple layering gallstones within the gallbladder.
These findings made ischemic colitis less likely and then patient was treated as a Crohn's colitis patient and started on IV steroids, continued on levo and Flagyl, which she is to complete for a 14 day course and steroids eventually switched to a p.o.
Patient's diarrhea improved throughout the course of her stay with decreased output and decreased frequency.
Cholestatic picture:  Patient has known chronic gallstones which were seen on the right upper quadrant ultrasound, which showed multiple small gallstones which shadow, some of which were adherent to the gallbladder wall and there were focal areas of thickening and edema of the gallbladder wall.
Trace amount of cholecystic fluid.
There is no bile duct dilatation or common duct dilatation and the liver appeared normal.
However, with patient's elevated alkaline phosphatase and elevated GGT, and there was concern for possible cholangitis picture as patient had some mild fevers during the early course of her admission.
This was more likely attributed to her Crohn's flareup, however, concerns for cholangitis can be ruled out and with elevated LFTs and history of gallstones, plans were made to do a ERCP or MRCP to evaluate her biliary tree.
Anemia:  Patient with longstanding iron deficiency anemia on iron replacement.
However, with coronary artery disease and active ischemia, goal was to keep hematocrit greater than 30.
Nutrition:  Patient was on diabetic 2-gram sodium, low residue, low lactose diet for her diarrhea and otherwise was stable.
She did have her phosphorus and magnesium repleted at time, however, all remained within normal limits.
Patient ambulating with a cane not requiring oxygen, chest pain free with decreased amounts of bowel movements.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation.
Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
