THe HCP was then informed earlier on the day of admission that patient was hypoxic and had to be sent to the ED emergently.
Also of note was seen in ED for evaluation of cord compression causing weakness .
O2 sat then dropped precipitously to 81% on NC with increasing rales.
For hyperkelmia with K of 6.4, she was given Ca gluconate, insulin, HCO3.
Dopamine was titrated up with good BP response BP 126/52 P 91 currently on 20mcg of Dopa via peripheral IV as per family wishes no central line or invasive interventions.
They insisted that no central line should be placed and no escalation of care.

Left retrocardiac opacity consistent with atelectasis versus consolidation.
Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.
Hypoxia: Likely was secondary to pneumonia.
Less likley related to CHF as no pulmonary edema on CXR and no response to diuresis.
Hypotension: Most likely secondary to septic shock given bandemia, leukocytosis, and pneumonia.
ARF on CRI: Elevated creatinine above baseline, likely secondary to hypotension and decreased renal perfusion from decreased forward flow and possibly overdiuresis.
Hyperkalemia: Likely secondary to ARF on CRI, K had been coming down with Calcium, insulin, D50, bicarb, lasix.
Dispo: Patient transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from the ED with hypoxic respiratory failure.
Patient also transferred on dopamine drip for hypotension.
