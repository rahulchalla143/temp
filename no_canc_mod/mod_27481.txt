A CT scan here showed progression from the outside scan, and despite normal coags, he was given Factor 7 as it was not known whether his bleeding continued.
The patient was kept sedated as he became very agitated when off sedation and his BP would rise above goal ranges.
On transfer to the floor, the patient's alertness improved, as did his attention to the left side of space and awareness of his weakness.
2.ID: The patient was spiking fevers since admission and this seemed to worsen over time, with spikes to the 103 range at times.
He had a sputum sent which grew haemophilus and strep pneumoniae.
He also had a CXR which showed LLL hazy opacity.
He has evidence of sinus disease on multiple CTs.
3.CV: As above, he had significant hypertension with agitation.
He was started on metoprolol and lisinopril, with prn hydralazine being used.
On [**7-13**], an incidental R pulmonary nodule was found.
