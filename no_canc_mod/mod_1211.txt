The patient reports that symptoms started 3 days ago with fever to 100.7 (ear) and non-productive cough, with progressively worsening dyspnea on minimal exertion such that on the day of admission she had difficulty walking to her bathroom.
She does have a history of well controlled asthma, although states that her current symptoms are not consistent with prior asthma flare although dypsnea did improve with albuterol MDI.
She does endorse rhinorrhea and fatigue, but denies any sore throat, myalgias, LBP, sinus congestion, or wheezing.
Her husband had a cough several days ago, but denies any other sick contacts or recent travel.
She initially presented to an OSH ED, where she had a CXR demonstrating bilateral lower lung field opacities (R>L) felt to be CAP and was treated with CTX and azithromycin, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Her [**Hospital1 18**] course has been notable for a persistent tachcyardia, tachypnea, and an increasing oxygen requirement now up to a 15L face mask from 4L on admission.
Currently, the patient states that her breathing is improved after a neb treatment.

# Eosinophilic pneumonitis: Patient's A-a gradient was >180 with potential etiologies including V/Q mismatch, diffusion abnormality, or shunt.
Given absolute eosinophilic count of >3000, fever, and acute shortness of breath, the diagnosis of acute eosinophilic pneumonia was presumptively made.
She was treated with solumedrol 125 Q6H with improvement in symptoms and rapid weaning of supplemental oxygen to room air.
She was also covered for pneumonia initially with vancomycin and levofloxacin, but the regimen was narrowed to a 5 day course of azithromycin, which she completed while hospitalized.
She will require PCP prophylaxis if steroid course continues for longer than 1 month, and this will be determined as an outpatient.
# Hyperglycemia: elevated FSBG in the setting of steroid use.

Discharge Instructions: You were seen in the hospital for shortness of breath, likely caused by eosinophilic pneumonitis (pneumonia associated with an increase in a white blood cell called eosinophils).
You were also found to have elevated blood sugars after being started on prednisone, which is a common side effect.
