Known left subclavian stenosis, previous aorto-bifemoral bypass, complicated cardiac disease with multiple interventions.
The patient complains of right leg numbness post cardiac catheterization.
Cardiac catheterization of [**2196-6-23**] demonstrates right coronary artery graft and native vessel totally occluded, left main trunk disease of 50%, anterior descending native vessel totally occluded and bypass graft with a proximal and marginal shows an 81% stenosis, second obtuse marginal with a 50% stenosis.
Left ventricle shows inferior akinesis.
There is a left subclavian total occlusion.
Vascular was requested to evaluate the patient for right leg numbness post cardiac catheterization.
She had a repeat catheterization in [**2195-12-2**] for unstable angina.
She had severely diseased right coronary artery graft and required stenting of the right coronary artery graft.
A follow up catheterization in [**2196-1-1**] showed patent diagonal and right coronary artery grafts with a 50% stenosis of the diagonal.
She underwent a repeat cardiac catheterization in [**Month (only) 956**] of this year which showed distal left main trunk mildly tapered, irregular left anterior descending artery with diagonal saphenous vein graft patent but graft with a 70% stenosis The circumflex was a non-dominant system with 50% stenosis of the first obtuse marginal.
There was a 95% in stent stenosis and a 60-70% stenosis at the anastomosis.
Medical history includes hypothyroidism on Synthroid therapy, history of seizure disorder, trauma related to motor vehicle accident in [**2181**] on medical therapy, history of HIT, bilateral carotid disease.
She also has allergies to Codeine, Sulfa and Ceclor, reactions unknown.
Previous surgery includes the coronary artery surgery, aorto-bifemoral bypass grafting in [**2194**], left shoulder surgery for Erb's palsy at the age of 12, appendectomy in [**2166**], cervical spine surgery in [**2175**], lumbosacral spine surgery in [**2195-12-2**], bladder suspension in [**2174**].
The patient is in no acute distress but complains of right leg numbness and discomfort in the supine position in bed.
There is no jugular venous distention.
Heart has a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities show a mottled, cool right lower extremity distally with Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
However, she had sever underlying vascular disease that appeared to be acutely worse.The patient was begun on a Hirudin drip and she improved back to her perceived baseline and recommendations were for long term anticoagulation.
Further evaluation of her peripheral vascular disease was going to be done with a MRA.
However, her right leg symptoms worsened and she started to show signs of muscle damage in her right leg.She underwent a MRA on [**2196-6-28**] which demonstrated that the ascending aorta was of normal caliber.
The innominate artery is normal and gives rise to the right subclavian which is also normal with a low grade, mild stenosis at the junction of the right subclavian and axillary artery.
The left subclavian shows a high grade stenosis at its take-off but is normal in the remainder of its course.
There is focal stenosis to a 1.7 cm normal segment above the origin of the superficial femoral and profunda arteries.
The patient was evaluated by physical therapy who felt that the patient will need some rehabilitation for gait training and strengthening prior to being discharged to home.
Coronary artery disease, status post left heart catheterization.
Ischemic right lower extremity, status post right axillo-bifemoral bypass.
Hypothyroidism with medication adjustment.
