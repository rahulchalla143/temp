On catheterization, the patient was found to have total occlusion of the mid portion of the right coronary artery.
The patient underwent angioplasty and stent placement with no residual stenosis.
Post catheterization, the patient became hypotensive and required dopamine for blood pressure support.
The patient ruled in for a ST elevation inferior wall myocardial infarction with a peak creatinine kinase of 3,219 and creatinine kinase MB of 258.
The patient continued without further chest pain or EKG changes throughout the remainder of the hospitalization.
A post myocardial infarction transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated decreased left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 40 to 50% secondary to moderate hypokinetic basal and mid ventricular segments of the inferior and posterior free wall of the left ventricle.
The post myocardial infarction Telemetry demonstrated consistent normal sinus rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions.
The patient had a lipid panel which demonstrated hypertriglyceridemia with a normal low density lipoprotein on Zocor.
The patient continued with low systolic blood pressures from ranging in the 90's to 100's, however, was able to tolerate a low dose beta blocker for post myocardial infarction protection.
The patient completed a CPAP wean and was extubated on hospital day #2.
The patient has a known history of asthma and required minimal nebulizer treatments throughout the admission.
The patient was maintained on adequate oxygenation saturation post extubation without supplemental oxygen.
Hematology:  The patient has no known history of gastric or duodenal ulcer disease.
However, on hospital day #2 the patient had coffee ground emesis from the gastric tube.
GI:  The patient developed an upper GI bleed with one episode of coffee ground emesis on hospital day #2.
The patient was subsequently started on high dose Protonix with no further evidence of GI bleed.
Endocrine:  The patient was found on admission to have hyperglycemia (blood glucose in the 400's), ketonuria, and metabolic acidosis with a pH at the outside hospital of 6.98, consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis.
Neuro:  Status post extubation, the patient demonstrated new mental status changes with inattentiveness and poor short term memory.
The patient has a known seizure disorder, however, there was no evidence of seizure activity during the hospitalization.
Neurology was consulted on hospital day #4 for a persistent change in mental status.
The head MRI / MRA was without evidence of infarction, mass, or flow abnormality.
Pending a normal EEG, the most likely cause of the patient's change in mental status is anoxic encephalopathy.
SUMMARY:  The patient is a 44 year-old female with a history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, asthma, and seizure disorder who presented from an outside hospital status post asystolic arrest in the setting of an inferior wall myocardial infarction.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with total occlusion of the right coronary artery and is now status post stent angioplasty and stent placement.
The patient is now five days status post asystolic arrest with myocardial infarction and demonstrates persistent mental status changes likely consistent with anoxic brain injury.
Asystolic arrest status post inferior wall myocardial infarction.
Diabetic ketoacidosis.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Coronary artery disease status post right coronary artery stent placement on [**10-27**].
Follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8619**] at the [**Hospital 616**] Clinic for diabetes management at 10 AM.
