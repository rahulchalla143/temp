Last night, noted severe RUE pain and found to have a R brachial artery clot with decreased pulses then went to ED where he was also found to have some component of CHF.
Currently, no SOB or CP or RUE pain.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p one V CABG St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] MVR CRI HTN Atrial Fibrillation Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy Diabetes mellitus Hypercholesterolemia Cardiomyopathy - Echo [**9-5**] - EF 55%, Stress Echo [**8-31**] EF30% hypokinesis (unclear why discrepancy)   Social History: Retired Russian literature professor.
20 pack year.
Poor air movement in general.
Hard hematoma and edema in RUE.
A nonobstructing calculus is again identified in the lower pole of the right kidney.
The kidneys are unchanged in appearance with no hydronephrosis.
The brachial, radial and ulnar arteries are all patent with triphasic waveforms.
There is a sizable hematoma in the right upper forearm.
There is no evidence of AV fistula.
TEE:  The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen  in the body of the left atrium and moderate/severe SEC in the left atrial  appendage.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
There are complex (>4mm, non-mobile) atheroma in the ascending  aorta, in the aortic arch, and in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic  valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the  aortic valve.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mass or vegetation  is seen on the mitral valve.
A small paravalvular leak is probably present.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are  mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CT  TOrso: CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST:  No mediastinal hematoma is identified.
The thoracic aorta is of normal contour with evidence of atherosclerotic disease.
There is prominent mediastinal fat as well as prominence of the brachiocephalic vessels, which could explain the mediastinal widening seen on the prior chest radiograph.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are present with possible loculated components along the major fissures bilaterally.
Associated atelectasis is seen within the dependent portions of both lungs.
There is no evidence of failure.
No pneumothorax is seen.
There are calcifications within the coronary arteries as well as evidence of prior mitral valve replacement.
Nonobstructing stone is seen within the lower pole of the right kidney measuring 11 mm.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.
There is a gallstone within the gallbladder with no pericholecystic inflammatory change.
No dilatation or wall thickening is seen within large or small bowel.
No periaortic stranding seen.
No free fluid or free air is seen within the abdomen.
There is sigmoid diverticuli with no fat stranding or wall thickening to suggest diverticulitis.
CT head:  :  No definite evidence for acute intracranial pathology including signs of hemorrhage or infarction.
Equivocal region of hypodensity within the left frontal lobe, which may be artifactual.
Given that this patient has multiple old areas of infarction and obvious areas of atherosclerosis within the cerebral vasculature, an MRI with diffusion would be a more sensitive test to evaluate for acute infarction.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P:  82 y/o male with ischemic DCM, MVR who p/w acute brachial arterial thromoboembolic event and CHF in setting of stopping anticoagulation.
Likely [**2-3**] diastolic dysfunction, valvular dysfunction and NSTEMI.
Started isordil/hydral for afterload inhibition in setting of renal failure.
No standing lasix.
*  MVR: No evidence of clot by TEE.
CAD:  Mild troponin leak.
Likely [**2-3**] demand ischemia.
Very high risk for future events.
Underwent thrombectomy in OR successfully.
[**Name (NI) **] pt has large hematoma and decreased, but palpable pulses.
Likely the pt had pre-renal azotemia from forward failure, overaggressive diuresis with lasix and neseritide.
GFR improving, but may have new baseline.
No evidence of renal infarction.
No visual problems while in house.
