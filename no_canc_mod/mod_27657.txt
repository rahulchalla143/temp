Admission Date:  [**2154-11-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-11-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2085-11-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2518**] Chief Complaint: 68yo F transferred for acute onset of speech difficulty  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting of delerium tremens.
History of Present Illness: 68yo RH F h/o EtOH abuse, heavy smoking, HTN, CAD s/p MI in [**2150**] and h/o MS who was well until last night.
Around 9:30pm, the patient first had difficulty speaking in that her speech was slightly slurred.
Details of the history were provided by her daughter, as the patient has severe difficulty articulating her words.
The patient's daughter noticed a new right facial droop (that the patient says was not present last night).
She denies visual disturbances or diplopia and denies other deficits such as gait difficulty, dizziness, incoordination, headache, neck pain or manipulation, numbness/tingling.
ROS: On review of systems, the pt denied recent fever or chills.
No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain.
Denied cough, shortness of breath.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p MI in [**2150**] (no stents or surgery) HTN MS: diagnosed decades ago.
Details are hard to come by; it seems that her previous flares consisted of gait difficulty and possibly the left hand (which she points to).
She denies h/o blurry vision with her attacks and definitely had no flares like this before.
Family History: Father had DM2, mother had breast cancer   Physical Exam: VS 97.4 124/83 62 12 97% Gen Awake, cooperative, NAD HEENT NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in oropharynx Neck Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.

Walks steadily but with slightly wide based gait.
Hypodense areas in the left frontal lobe, including involvement of the anterior sylvian region, compatible with acute infarction.
Increased mean transit time is visualized on the perfusion images along the superior margin of this area, also supportive of recent ischemia and/or infarction.
No significant mismatch between blood volume, flow and MTT is noted to suggest significant salvageable tissue or penumbra.
Non-occlusive filling defect in a sylvian branch of the left middle cerebral artery, although the area of recent infarction is probably not primarily supplied by the vessel containing the filling defect.
Lucency about the lateral root of [**Doctor First Name **] 3, which could represent a periodontal abscess or dentigerous cyst.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism seen.
No hemorrhage.
No other significant new abnormalities since the previous CT of [**2154-11-5**].
[**2154-11-11**] MRI head: IMPRESSION: Acute infarcts of the left frontal lobe and insula not significantly changed in extent compared to CT scans.
Moderate degree of chronic microangiopathic changes and an old infarct of the left cerebellum.
Compared to previous tracing cardiac rhythm is now atrial fibrillation.
On [**2154-11-6**] the patient had new onset afib with rapid ventricular response (HR to 156) and blood pressures dropping into the low 100s.
The patient was transferred to the ICU so that pressors could be hung as we were concerned that her low blood pressure might put her at further risk for ischemic injury in the setting of her recent stroke.
Unfortunately she was still in and out of atrial fibrillation and a cardiology consult was required.
She was briefly on a propofol gtt and receiving regular ativan as the SICU team felt that she was at high risk for withdrawal related MI or seizures and as she was also very combative.
An ECHO did not demonstrate a cardiac source for the embolus.
The carotids had no significant stenosis on the CTA of the neck.
Given the likelihood that the patient's stroke was cause by her atrial fibrillation the patient was started on a heparin gtt and Coumadin was given as well.
A urine culture was positive for E.coli and Stenotrophomonas.
After extubation, she was also noted to have large bilateral pleural effusions.
She has had persistent expressive aphasia with aphonia.
She was evaluated by   Speech who noted a possible L vocal cord paralysis.
She was then seen  by ENT who noted that her vocal cords are mobile, but she had large posterior gap and significant laryngeal edema.
She was also re-evaluated multiple times for aspiration and failed.
Quetiapine 25 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: 0.5 Tablet PO Q12H PRN () as needed for aggitation.
