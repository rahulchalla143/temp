He initially presented to OSH on [**2115-10-7**] with pleuritic chest pain that came on acutely that morning.
No recent long travel, trauma or history of clots.
Presented to [**Hospital1 1474**] where he was found to have bilateral segmental PE by contrast chest CT.
He recieved 2 total doses of lovenox, with most recent dose of 60mg at 6am the morning of transfer.
Subsequently head CT was performed which showed evidence of acute on chronic subdural hematoma.
He had no complaints of headache, nausea/vomiting, vision changes, numbness or increased left sided weakness.
At that time, CT scan of the head showed interval increase in size of the right frontal subdural hypodense collection which measures 8 mm thick at its greatest width, consistent with a chronic subdural hematoma.
No midline shift.
There was resolution of blood within the left inferior frontal contusion.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], admitted to ICU, complains of R sided chest pain with deep breaths.
No other complaints at that time.
Past Medical History: 1. bilateral frontal hemmorrage- in setting of MVA, c/b L sided weakness 2. h/o enterobacter and staph aureus pneumonia   Social History: lives at home with girlfriend and kids.

Pertinent Results: OSH Chest CT w/ contrast [**2115-10-7**]- our read- bilateral segmental PE w/ small r pleural effusion OSH Head CT [**2115-10-8**]- our read- chronic R subdural hematoma w/ layered areas of increased attenuation concerning for acute hematoma; left frontal hypoattenuation c/w known prior hemmorrage OSH b/l LENI: negative for DVT OSH ECHO: EF 60%; trace TR.
There has been continued evolution of the subdural hematoma at the right frontal convexity.
The overall volume of the hematoma appears to have slightly increased when measured from the inner table.
However, there is no evidence of midline shift.
There is mild mass effect upon the underlying frontal lobe and upon the ipsilateral frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle.
As before, there is hypodensity within the right inferior frontal lobe consistent with contusion.
There is no evidence of a new hemorrhage.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
There is no evidence of a new hemorrhage.
[**2115-10-10**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) 1093**]: There has been no interval change in the appearance of the cervical spine from the prior examination.
The alignment of the cervical vertebral bodies is normal.
No paraspinal signal abnormality is demonstrated.
At C3-4, mild left neural foraminal narrowing is due to a small left posterior osteophyte.
At C4-C5, no disc herniation, spinal stenosis, or neural foraminal stenosis is present.
At C5-C6, prominent bilateral foraminal narrowing is secondary to uncovertebral degenerative changes.
At C6-C7, there is mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing secondary to uncovertebral spurring.
No disc herniation or spinal stenosis is present.
[**10-9**] head CT: The right subdural hematoma has moderately increased in size and has a new acute hemorrhage.
The extension of this hematoma cranially toward vertex is now more evident.
There is mild local mass effect, however, there is no shift of midline structures.
There are no other areas of intracranial hemorrhage.
The ventricles are normal, without hydrocephalus.
[**10-16**] Head CT: subdural 16mm max diameter (increased from 14mm) w/ signs of increased intensity around rim.
?rebleed vs nl changes of acute bleed to chronic subdurl?
This corresponds to the patient's known pulmonary embolism diagnosed at an outside hospital a few days earlier.
There is dense consolidation in the superior, lateral and posterior segments of the right and left lower lobes.
There are overlying moderate-sized pleural effusions bilaterally  Head CT [**10-19**] stable   Brief Hospital Course: 57 yo M s/p traumatic head injury in [**8-8**] with bifrontal hemmorhage who was transferred from OSH on [**10-9**] with chest pain and dyspnea.
At OSH he would found to have bilateral PE's via CTA.
This was placed on [**10-10**] with improvement in chest pain and other sxs.
His pain was controlled with morphine prn.
On [**10-11**] he c/o worsening chest pain and SOB with sats notable for 92% on RA which improved with supplimental oxygen.
He had such severe pleuritic pain that he was taking very shallow breaths and was tachypnic near 35 RR.
CXR showed RLL collapse with dense consolidation and moderate B pleural effusions.
CTA chest showed dense consolidation with small PTX.
Pulmonary service was consulted and felt [**3-7**] aspiration pneumonia, no signs of bronchial obstruction considering air bronchograms were seen through the consolidation.
He was therefore started on levofloxacin and metronidazole for presumed aspiration pneumonia and rapidly improved.
His pain was also treated and he was given an agressive pain regimen.
His fever and leukocytosis also resolved.
With regard to anticoagulation, subdural hematoma on head CT [**10-14**] looked stable and the decision was made to reattempt anticoagulation on [**10-15**] with heparin nomogram at starting rate 15U/kg no IV bolus and coumadin 3mg.
The evening of [**10-16**] he c/o a strange sensation in his head and repeat head CT showed slight expansion of the lesion with question of some hyperintensity of the hematoma.
Impression: 57 yo M with bilateral PE's, evidence of RLL collapse vs dense consolidation, likely pneumonia, PTX, s/p traumatic [**Hospital1 **] with bilateral subdural hematoma with expansion on heparin now s/p [**Hospital1 **] filter placement .
# Pulmonary: Pt likely with several pulmonary pathologies.
B/C air bronchograms were seen through the RLL lung parenchyma, obstruction not felt to be involved.
[**Month (only) 116**] have had lung infarction from PE with extension of free air into pleura.
This could have been the cause of his severe chest pain several days ago.
- [**Month (only) **] filter for PE) - Abx for pneumonia - repeat CT chest in 6 wks .
# Pneumonia.
RLL pneumonia that has been improving on levoflox + flagyl.
- plan 2 wk course of levoflagyl (from start [**10-11**]) - repeat CTA chest in 6 weeks to confirm resolution of RLL collapse .
# Chest pain/dyspnea: pleuritic in nature.
# Bilateral pulmonary embolus: given expansion of subdural hematomas, are not pursuing anticoagulation currently.
# Subdural hematomas: worsened and hemorrhaged initially on heparin; they have since stabilized on CT scan and patient is clinically stable.
Question of recent expansion?
# Constipation: Improved with bowel regimen- colace, senna standing .
# Prophylaxis - SCDs .
