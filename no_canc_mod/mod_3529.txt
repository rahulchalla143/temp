Admission Date:  [**2138-11-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2138-11-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2062-4-3**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**] Chief Complaint: Cardiac Arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal Intubation Femoral Venous Access Femoral Arterial Access  History of Present Illness: 76yo M with known CAD s/p 2V CABG [**2129**], afib, became unresponsive at 3pm while on the couch.
Pt became bradycardic with electrical rate 70's, perfusing beats 30's by femoral palpation.
Decision was made not to proceed with cardiac catheterization given risks vs. benefits in setting of active bleeding and anticoagulation needed for cath.
CARDS: could not auscultate discernable rhythm, absent peripheral pulses, femoral pulses weakly palpable.
Neuro: unresponsive, no doll's eye, no corneal reflex, no withdrawal from painful stimulus, upper extremity flexion with lower extremity extension- consistent with decorticate posturing.
CT head- No acute changes, no hemorrhage, no midline shift.
Stress MIBI- [**2135-10-5**]- large size, severe inferior wall defect which is partially reversible and a moderately severe inferolateral wall defect which is reversible.
There is akinesis at the apex and hypokinesis in the inferior wall at the level of the exercize achieved.
EKG: NSR, q-waves in II, III, aVF, 2mm ST depressions in V2, V3, V4.
Brief Hospital Course: 76yo M with known CAD s/p 2V CABG [**2129**], afib, HTN, hyperlipidemia, became unresponsive 3pm, found to be in Vfib arrest, now with absent brain stem reflexes and seizure-like activity, bradycardic, hypotensive, on dopamine and norepinephrine drips.
1) Cardiac- Ischemia- Possible acute posterior MI with old inferior MI although localization of area of infarct in Vfib arrest is difficult.
Likely acute blood loss.
LV function- known CAD, moderately depressed EF from [**2135**].
3) Pulm- Witnessed aspiration event, pt breathing over vent secondary to Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis likely secondary to elevated blood lactate.
4) [**Name (NI) **] Pt was found to have prominent lymphocytosis.
However this seems unlikely to be related to acute vfib arrest.
