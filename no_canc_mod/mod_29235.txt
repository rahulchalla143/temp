Assess for spinal cord/ligamentous injury.
Increased T2 and STIR signal intensity is seen in the spinal cord extending from the level of the tip of the dens to the superior endplate of the C4 vertebral body.
There is mild expansion of the cord at the level of the body of C2.
Axial gradient echo images demonstrate susceptibility artifact centrally in the cord at the level of C2.
At the C2-3 and C3-4 levels, there is mild left paracentral disc bulging with mild narrowing of the left neural foramina at these levels.
There is no central canal stenosis.
Vertebral body and intervertebral disc signal elsewhere in the cervical spine is normal.
Mild edema is seen in the prevertebral soft tissues.
Increased T2 and STIR signal intensity is also seen in the interspinous area posterior to C2.
Signal abnormalities in the spinal cord indicate focal areas of hemorrhage in the central cord posterior to C2, and cord edema from C2-C4 as described above.
There is also mild expansion of the cord at the C2 level.
Probable ligamentous injury of the interspinous ligaments at the level of C2-3.
Mild left paracentral disc bulges at C2-3 and C3-4 with mild left neural foraminal narrowing.
FEMUR (AP & LAT) SOFT TISSUE R  Reason: eval fx  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 17 year old woman with MVC and likely R femur fx REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval fx HISTORY: Fracture.
Two radiographs of the right femur demonstrate a displaced fracture through the mid diaphysis of the right femur.
Ionated contrast is present within urinary bladder as is a Foley catheter balloon.
for vertebral artery dissection Contrast: MAGNEVIST  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 17 year old woman s/p C2-C4 cord contusion and C1 fx, now paraplegic with fevers and new onset vertical nystagmus concerning for new brainstem lesion.
FINDINGS: There are areas of susceptibility artifact of the posterior upper neck and skull base consistent with artifacts from surgical fusion.
The upper spinal cord and the adjacent medulla are expanded and have increased T2 signal.
There are no signal changes indicative of blood within the spinal cord or medulla.
No epidural fluid collections or abscesses are seen, although evaluation is somewhat limited by adjacent artifact.
The above findings may represent changes of cord and brainstem contusion vs. infection, with no evidence of abscess formation.
A type 2 dens fracture is present.
No extra-axial fluid collections are seen.
There is no shift of the normally midline structures.
FINDINGS: The V4 segment of the right vertebral artery is hypoplastic but patent.
Enhancement, expansion, and T2 hyperintensity involving the upper cervical cord and medulla which likely represents changes of contusion Vs. infection without abscess formation.
Posterior cervical spinal fusion with a type 2 dens fracture still visible.

UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT P  Reason: SWELLING AND FEVER IN QUADEPLEGIC  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 17 year old woman with quadriplegia and incg size of RLE and fever REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval DVT c doppler INDICATION: 17-year-old female with quadriplegia, increasing size of right lower extremity and fever.
RIGHT UNILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND:  [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed.
No evidence of intraluminal thrombus.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of DVT.
I agree with her assessment and plan of action and would add the following:  Her parents were present during my visit today.
This suggests a lesion in the brainstem connections with the anterior semicircular canals; this tends to occur in the pontomedullary junction, and this localization is consistent with the known enhancing lesion seen on the overnight MRI from yesterday.
Because her ocular findings developed over the past couple of days, which her parents confirm, it argues against the lesion being ischemic and directly related to her original trauma as that event was over two weeks ago and would be beyond the period of maximal swelling.
I understand the lesion is felt to be an abscess, which would be more in line with the development of her symptoms and findings.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 67614**] was admitted to the trauma surgical ICU at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2198-6-28**] as a transfer from an outside hospital with a C1 fracture, C2-C4 spinal cord hemorrhage/edema, facial bone fractures, and right femur fracture following a car vs. tree motor vehical crash.
On hospital day #4, she had two episodes of bradycardia which were self-limited and self-resolved.
She returned to the operating room on [**2198-7-9**] for placement of an inferior vena cava filter for DVT prophylaxis.
[**7-11**]: Fever spiked, started on ceftiaxone for GNR coverage in sputum [**7-12**]: Fever, stopped ctx given Stenotr and started empiric PO flagyl (discontinued on [**7-19**]) [**7-13**]: spiked again, pancx., lost PICC [**7-14**]: Bronched, minimal mucus; foley changed/irrigated with ampho [**7-16**]: Started having upbeat nystagmus, Neurology consulted (see Pertinent results for note), then MRA head and neck.
Has likely brainstem abscess & ?R vert artery CVA/dissection.
Was started on ASA 325 qd; this has been discontinued secondary no dissection was identified.

Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
Heparin (Porcine) 5,000 unit/mL Solution Sig: 5000 (5000) Units Injection TID (3 times a day) as needed for prophylaxis.
