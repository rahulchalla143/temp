Based on notes, has a history of complex partial seizures with secondary generalization.
He has had recent cough and phlegm production.
He was urgently intubated and sedated, but developed seizure in the ED each time propofol was weaned.
Of note, he has a history of MSSA bacteremia in [**7-25**] and have hardware in place (a VP shunt).
Review of Systems: Not obtainable as Pt is intubated, sedated, and paralyzed  Past Medical History: - Traumatic head and neck injury s/p MVC in [**2091**] in Bolivia with brain and spinal cord damage, s/p shunt and shunt revision.
- Recurrent complex partial seizures with secondary generalization s/p MVC, described in prior notes as a "shaking of his extremities, facial twitching and/or mouth movements/lip smacking", usually occur in clusters and are prolonged.
Previously on Dilantin, transitioned to Depakote which became ineffective, Keppra added when he had recurrence of his events approximately 4 years ago.
Patient was instructed to take Keppra 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **], but was only taking 750 mg [**Hospital1 **] "because his mother did not make the dose increase as recommended because he has not had any seizures and becuase she is trying to make Keppra last longer."

- Tobacco: Denies - etOH: Denies - Illicits: Denies  Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: GEN: Intubated and non-interactive, does not follow commands or respond to verbal stimuli, withdraws from painful stimuli, in NAD.
HEENT: Sclera non-icteric, pupils minimally sluggishly reactive, spontaneous lateral nystagmus, no nasal discharge, neck supple CV: RRR, no MRG PULM: Coarse BS, crackles a the L base ABD: BS+, Soft, NT/ND, no masses or HSM LIMBS: Decorticate positioning of hands and feet bilaterally, no obvious wounds, but some scars.
Active spontaneous horizontal nystagmus on exam.
Withdraws to pain in both upper limbs.
There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or evidence of interval vascular territorial infarction.
Encephalomalacia is redemonstrated in the frontal lobes bilaterally as well as in the right occipital lobe.
The included paranasal sinuses are notable for circumferential mucosal thickening in the ethmoidal air cells bilaterally.
The included mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: Minimal change from the comparison studies, with marked ventriculomegaly, despite the presence of two ventriculostomy catheters.
Of note, there is no evidence of transpendemyal migration of CSF to specifically suggest an acute obstructive component.
Note is also made of a right femoral central venous line.
A tubular structure over the midline in the pelvis may represent a rectal tube or conceivably a Foley catheter.
There is hazy opacity in the right upper lung zone and retrocardiac region, concerning for areas of infection.
There is chronic elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, unchanged.
There is no effusion or pneumothorax.
Hazy opacities in right lung and retrocardiac region concerning for infection.
The findings are consistent with chronic occlusive right internal jugular vein thrombosis.
No left leg DVT.
Given the high position of the stomach underneath the ribcage, a safe window do not exist for percutaneous access and the study was canceled after discussion with the medical team.
Brief Hospital Course: 33 year old gentleman with a history of traumatic brain injury, seizure disorder, bactreremia with a VP shunt in place on long term antibiotics (cephalexin to [**3-/2107**]), and aspiration in the past who was admitted in status eplipticus with a high fever and possible pneumonia on CXR.
There was concern for a meningoencephalitis but LP was negative.
# Sepsis: Ultimately believed to be due to aspiration pneumonia.
Initially on Dexamethasone 10 mg IV Q6H for possible Strep pneumo meningitis.
DFA for influenza was negative.
He completed 7 day course without any evidence of recurrent infection.
He was placed back on Cephalexin, suppressive dose, for history of right IJ thrombophlebitis with positive culture.
# Transaminase elevation: Etiology unclear.
# DVT: Patient was found to have difference in bilateral lower extremity temparatures.
He was found to have right lower extremity DVT.
The recommendation for long term anticoagulation was made to the family given his prior history of RIJ thrombus and his risk factors for clotting (bed bound)is not going to resolve.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr.[**Known lastname 68285**],  You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] with fever and seizures.
Your fevers were due to aspiration pneumonia (infection of the lungs).
You were treated with antibiotics and your symptoms improved.
Your seizures were also due to the infection as well.
You were also found to have new clots in the right leg.
Too low of the levels placed you at risk for clotting and higher levels places you at risk for serious bleeding.
