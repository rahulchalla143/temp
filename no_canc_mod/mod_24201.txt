A CTA elsewhere revealed a Type A dissection, extending to the renal, without visualization of the right kidney.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
A mobile density is seen in the ascending aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection.
The aortic wall is thickened consistent with an intramural hematoma, which extends into the descending aorta.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**1-8**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small left pleural effusion.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
A pacing for slow sinus.
Repaired ascending aorta with synthetic material seen.
No residual dissection flap seen.
No AI seen.
No normal arterial venous waveforms noted within the right kidney with an abnormal-appearing pulsatile flow only seen within the right renal hilum likely representing collateral flow from lumbar vessels.
More normal-appearing arterial and venous waveforms within the left kidney.
The aortic contour is still enlarged which might be related to recent surgery and the presence of known dissection.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is small amount of left pleural effusion but overall the aeration at the lung bases has improved in the interim.
During surgery, the aorta appeared abnormal and aortitis was considered.
His pathology report suggested a differential diagnosis that included Ehlers-Danlos Type IV.
As mentioned earlier Infectious disease was consulted to evaluate for an infectious cause of his dissection or aortitis but it was felt that there was not evidence for either.
