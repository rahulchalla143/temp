He had obvious open left femur fracture, but remained hemodynamically stable in the field and on arrival to the emergency room at the [**Hospital1 188**].
Low back pain.
There was a left orbital ecchymosis.
Left pupils are irregular and unresponsive.
There was no instability of the face.
There was nasal blood bilaterally.
Trachea is midline with no crepitus.
There were no deformities.
Abdomen was nondistended and soft.
Back had no stepoff or deformities.
There is a left femur with obvious open fracture distal thigh.
ABI was 130/110 with palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial artery pulse.
Right had no deformities with palpable distal pulses.
RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  Chest x-ray was significant for a question of a widen mediastinum with good position of the ET tube.
Head CT Scan was significant for a large acute subdural hematoma with mass effect and shift to the right, extensive fascial fractures with pneumocephalus.
The facial fractures included the lateral and superior portion of the left orbit, multiple fractures of the ethmoid ..............., small bony chip in close proximity to the left optic nerve, fracture of the left orbital floor and multiple fractures of the left maxillary sinuses.
CT Scan of the C spine showed no evidence of acute fracture or dislocation.
CTA of the chest showed no aortic injury, but did show bilateral pulmonary contusion.
CT Scan of the abdomen showed no intraabdominal injuries, or free fluid, or free air.
Left femur film showed fracture of the mid distal third of the femur which was a compound fracture.
Film of the right hand showed a markedly comminuted spiral fracture of the proximal phalanx of the right second finger.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient after resuscitation and evaluation in the Trauma Bay was taken to the Operating Room for emergent craniotomy and evacuation of left epidural hematoma.
He underwent cerebral angiography on [**1-26**] which demonstrated a left direct carotid cavernous sinus fistula mid direct inferior maxillary artery, superior ophthalmic vein fistula which is coiled.
The patient's exam has remained stable, though visual acuity has not been tested secondary to patient's altered mental status, but will be followed as an outpatient.
The patient had a pulmonary artery arteriogram which showed a right middle lobe embolus and a inferior vena cava filter was placed.
On [**2186-1-29**], the patient had a left chest tube placed for increased effusion which was discontinued on [**2186-2-1**].
The patient has been extubated and has had pulmonary status which has been stable.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has remained hemodynamically stable and has required no further interventions.
Patient received an early swallow study which he failed secondary to altered mental status.
ENDOCRINOLOGIC:  Significant issues, patient received a 72 hour course of Solu-Medrol and received insulin drip for blood glucose control from which he has subsequently been discontinued and has remained stable.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Issues have included early course of Vancomycin and Gentamycin for the open femur fracture which were discontinued on postoperative day #5.
Later in his hospital course, the patient developed an increasing white count and low grade temperatures.
He was found to have right knee cellulitis and he was started on Kefzol for which he has completed a seven day course.
From the injury perspective, patient's femur fracture has been stable.
Following that surgery, the next day, the patient became agitated and tachypneic.
Chest x-ray showed a small left effusion, but no evidence of pulmonary edema.
Second significant event on hospital day #17, the patient demonstrated hoarseness of breath.
Oral was consulted and determined that patient had good medullization of the vocal cords and suggested a temporal bone CT Scan secondary to right hemotympanum which will be obtained prior to discharge.
Left epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma status post craniotomy and evacuation.
Direct carotid cavernous sinus fistula and indirect inferior maxillary artery sub-ophthalmic vein fistula status post coiling of latter.
Open left femur fracture status post IM rodding.
Left zygoma fracture status post open reduction internal fixation.
Right second proximal phalanx fracture status post open reduction internal fixation.
Right middle lobe pulmonary embolism status post IVC filter.
Left knee cellulitis status post course of Kefzol.
