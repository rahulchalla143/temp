There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Cath showed complete LCx occlusion which was stented with 2 DES.
# STEMI of LCx: Presented with typical chest pain, STE in the lateral leads with reciprocal changes in the inferior leads, as well as subsequent development of Q waves in the lateral leads in the setting of elevated cardiac enzymes, with troponins and CKMB of 0.66 and 58, respectively, on admission, peaking at 3.76 and 99, respectively, within 24 hours.
The patient remained in sinus rhythm and hemodynamically stable post-catheterization and throughout the course of the admission; her cardiac exam remained stable; she also remained clinically euvolemic.
Her percutaneous access site remained without clinical evidence of bruits, hematoma, or pseudoaneurysm.
Post-catheterization, the patient was started on ASA 325 mg daily for an indefinite course, and Plavix 75 mg daily x12 months; Metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] and Captopril 6.25 mg TID were started to optimize rate control and afterload reduction, with the Captopril transitioned to Lisinopril 5 mg daily prior to discharge and Metoprolol transition to Toprol XL 50 mg qd; Atorvastatin 80 mg daily was also started to optimize her lipid profile and for potential pleotrophic survival benefits.
Echo [**9-6**] showed: LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction 40 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the posterior and lateral walls, and mild hypokinesis of the inferior free wall.
# Transaminitis: Presented with a mild trans aminitis that peaked 24h after admission, with ALT 80 and AST 226 and showed a normalizing trend prior to discharge.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because you had a heart attack.
Please start taking the following NEW medications: START Plavix 75 mg daily (for one year) START Toprol XL 50 mg daily START Lisinopril 5 mg daily START Nitroglycerin below your tongue as needed for chest pain  STOP TAKING Simvastatin 40 mg daily START Atorvastatin 80 mg daily instead  STOP TAKING Ecotrin START taking Aspirin 325 mg daily instead  Please have blood taken on Friday [**2143-9-13**] so that labs can be checked; you can do this at [**Hospital1 18**].
Please return to the ED if you have any chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting or any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
