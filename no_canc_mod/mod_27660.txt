On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], pt spiked fever to 103.
Workup of the fever revealed severe RLL as well as large, loculated R pl.
Relevant recent hx includes admission to [**Hospital6 **] on [**2123-12-12**] w/ hypercarbic resp failure & MS changes.
She was thought to have COPD exacerbation & PNA, as well as possible CHF exacerbation.
Cause for her hypotension is unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) **] sputum from [**12-13**] grew pseudomonas (sensitive to gent, tobra, cefepime, imipenem, and zosyn).
Given overall picture, pt evaluated for trach & PEG at OSH; however, it was felt that she would be high risk for procedure given her kyphosis & body habitus, so she was transferred here for intervention.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], pt was con't on cefepime for tx of PNA as well as IV steroids & nebs for COPD and dilt gtt for rapid afib.
She underwent chest CT which showed PNA w/ large, complex effusion.
Additionally, CT showed possible filling defect in pulm artery, for which CTA was recommended to further eval.
Pt underwent flex bronch on [**12-23**], which showed small white exophytic playw in RML (likely aspirated food).
PPD performed--result pending.
Her afib has improved w/ regard to rate control.
No LE swelling, She notes that she only has diabetes while on steroids.

# MRSA Pneumonia: Pt was found to have LLL pneumonia, initially considered CAP vs. nosocomial as pt had been transferred from [**Hospital6 **] after being admitted there from home w/ PNA, and because pt had been vented for over a week before transfer.
Pt received cefepime for pseudomonal coverage per OSH cultures, and was started on vancomycin for MRSA in sputum.
# Respiratory distress: Pt originally intubated at OSH because of hypercarbic failure related to severe COPD, PNA, and pleural effusions.
Pt found to have bilateral pleural effusions likely [**3-5**] chronic process, and possibly related to previous infection (considered unlikely acute empyema).
A right-sided thoracentesis was performed on [**2123-12-27**] seeking to drain an effusion; this was complicated by the development of a pneumothorax which required the placement of a chest tube.
Pt administered heparin gtt and to r/o possible future PE source, bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds were obtained and confirmed no DVTs.
# COPD, possible exacerbation: Pt's baseline pulmonary function marked by severe COPD with hypercarbia & baseline 02 requirement.
Pt was therefore maintained on nebulizers and guaifenesin, and was started on methylprednisolone (Solumedrol) IV at 40mg IV q8h, which was tapered to 20mg q8h.
# CHF: Pt uses furosemide 60mg daily as home regimen for baseline CHF, and was restarted on furosemide 60mg QOD to maximize respiratory capacity and was increased to 60mg PO daily.
# Type II DM: Per pt, elevated glucose only when steroids used.
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day): Hold for loose stools.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Levalbuterol HCl 0.63 mg/3 mL Solution Sig: One (1) ML Inhalation q6hr prn () as needed for SOB, wheezing.
