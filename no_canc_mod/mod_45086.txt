Therefore, the decision was to proceed to CT scan guided biopsy of the right lower lobe lung mass and drainage of the right pleural effusion.
Radiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and they requested a two week follow-up CT scan of the chest to assess for progression of the right lower lobe lung mass, which was concerning for possible pneumonia / atelectasis / malignancy.
The follow-up CT scan of the chest showed no change in the size of the right lower lobe lung mass.
The left effusion was increased and loculated.
There was a ground glass nodule in the left lung apex which was concerning for bronchoalveolar carcinoma.
In view of these findings, the Medical team requested Radiology to proceed with biopsy of the right lower lobe lung mass and to drain the fluid on the right side for evaluation of cytology.
On [**2-13**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] received his CT scan guided right pleural effusion drainage.
10 cc were withdrawn and revealed serosanguinous fluid.
The fluid was negative for malignant cells.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5995**] was reluctant to biopsy Mr. [**Known lastname **]' right lower lobe lung because it appeared atelectatic and there was no obvious mass to biopsy.
Therefore, the recommendation was to proceed to an FDG nuclear scan of the chest to assess for viability of the right lower lobe lung mass.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] had some residual peri-wound discomfort post discontinuation of the pigtail.
He denied shortness of breath however.
