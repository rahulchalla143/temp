Admission Date:  [**2124-1-22**]       Discharge Date: [**2124-2-29**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old male with coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus who was admitted from a nursing home with change in mental status times seven days.
A head computed tomography was negative.
The working diagnosis was congestive heart failure.
The patient was initially admitted to the floor; however, the floor team asked the Medical Intensive Care Unit to evaluate for hypoxia and/or respiratory distress.
Dopamine was started for hypotension in the 60s/palpation.
A chest x-ray revealed new left lung whiteout.
An emergent bronchoscopy was performed and successfully suctioned copious amounts of mucous plugs from the left airway.
A repeat chest x-ray showed significant re-expansion.
Coronary artery disease; status post left anterior descending artery stent in [**2119**].
Peripheral vascular disease; status post aortobifemoral bypass, status post femoral-femoral bypass.
Ischemic colitis in [**2123-11-5**].
Left renal artery stenosis of 100%.
Diabetes mellitus.
Atrial fibrillation.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The abdomen was soft and nondistended.
Extremity examination revealed 2+ pitting edema bilaterally.
Urinalysis revealed positive nitrites, greater than 50 red blood cells, 11 to 20 white blood cells, many bacteria.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at 91, normal axis, and normal intervals.
1-mm ST elevations in V1 and V2.
ST depressions in V5 and V6.
A chest x-ray #1 initially revealed pulmonary edema with bilateral effusions.
Chest x-ray #2 revealed left lung whiteout/collapse, left mediastinal shift.
A head computed tomography revealed no acute bleeding.
PULMONARY SYSTEM:  The patient was seen with copious secretions and episodes of mucous plugs which were effectively suctioned.
Also with bilateral pleural effusions.
A diagnostic tap was performed of transudative effusion.
The patient was reintubated on [**2-1**] for ventilatory failure with respiratory distress, acidosis, hypercapnia.
Transudative and negative for malignant cells or organisms.
Due to pulmonary effusions with secretions, the patient was unable to be re-extubated.
GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  The patient has a history of ischemic colitis.
Beginning on the first week of admission, he began to bleed bright red/melanotic stool and was transfused as needed for maintaining a hematocrit above 30.
Ultimately, his bleeding slowed down on [**2-1**].
Then on [**2-3**], he had a colonoscopy performed for diagnostic purposes which revealed ischemic colitis up to the level of the splenic flexure; however, the colonoscope could not be further advanced.
He continued without bleeding, and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was placed on [**2-4**], and tube feeds were initiated on [**2-5**], and he began with more bright red blood per rectum.
He was started again on tube feeds and tolerated then well without any gross bleeding.
He continued with guaiac-positive stools, but no active copious bleeding.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient initially had a urinary tract infection with enterococcus and Citrobacter which was treated with Zosyn for 7/7 days.
Then, for ischemic colitis he was continued on Zosyn; however, this was discontinued after a 2-week course.
He was admitted with a large sacral decubitus ulcer.
The Plastic Service was consulted and initially suggested wet-to-dry dressing changes; however, they were consulted again on [**2-4**] and debrided it; revealing a stage IV ulcer.
Then, on [**2-20**], he became septic with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in his blood, and his left subclavian line was discontinued and revealed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus at the tip of the catheter.
It was felt to be secondary to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus line sepsis.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  (a)  Coronary artery disease: The patient with a history of coronary artery disease who had chest pain in the setting of his gastrointestinal bleed.
He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction with a slightly elevated troponin of 0.6.
which was discontinued secondary to hypotension.
(b)  Atrial fibrillation:  The patient with rapid atrial fibrillation despite being on Lopressor.
He was not anticoagulated because of his ischemic colitis and gastrointestinal bleed.
(c)  Congestive heart failure:  The patient with diastolic dyspnea; per echocardiogram.
An ACE inhibitor was not added secondary to acute renal failure.
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibody positive.
His platelets improved to the 140s, and the patient had no signs of thrombosis.
Prophylaxis with pneumatic boots only.
Ischemic colitis.
Respiratory failure secondary to mucous plugs.
Urinary tract infection.
Rapid atrial fibrillation.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibody positive.
Diabetes mellitus.
