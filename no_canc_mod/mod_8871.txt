Brief Hospital Course: Brief Summary: 36 y/o W with PSC s/p liver transplantation X 2, anoxic brain injury who is transferred with diarrhea, hypernatremia, and acute renal failure.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she was sent to the MICU for treatment hypernatremia (Na 160) & renal failure.
Renal failure was thought to be pre-renal in origin.
She was noted to have frequent diarrhea, and underwent sigmoidoscopy, which was suggestive of a UC flare.
CMV viral load & viral culture of sigmoid tissue were negative.
She was also found to have complete Left lower extremity DVT, and was started on lovenox [**Hospital1 **]--she was tried on coumadin, but this was discontinued after two doses as her INR rose to >17 after only two doses.
Detailed Course by Problem: # Hypernatremia: Due to hypovolemia from diarrhea + poor po intake.
As diarrhea slowed & pt's PO intake improved, IVF was discontinued and Mrs. [**Known lastname 32457**] was able to maintain adequate PO intake with Na in the low 140s.
Biopsy showed active colitis.
# L lower extremity swelling: She was found to have a large DVT in her left lower extremity, despite being on DVT prophylaxis with SC heparin.
This DVT is her first known thrombotic event, and it was felt to be due to her dehydration plus her immobility during her acute illness.
No active bleeding was found.
Her supratherapeutic INR was thought to be secondary to low Vit K stores from her diarrhea, antibiotics, and malnutrition.
Her underlying hepatic dysfunction may have also contributed to her elevated INR.
# PSC/Liver Transplant: Her primary liver disease is primary sclerosing cholangitis, which is treated with Ursodiol.
# UTI: Mrs. [**Known lastname 32457**] was found to have a urinary tract infection.
She has had a slow decrease in her hct following an admission Hct of 32.
Her stool was repeatedly guaiac negative, and there was no evidence of gross bleeding.
Her drop in hematocrit may have been a reflection of her baseline anemia (hct has reportedly w/ been in the upper-20s at her nursing home) plus a dilutional component in the setting of IVF.
# Cognitive deficits: Continued home medications, including ritalin, escitalopram, and risperdal.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Cefazolin in Dextrose (Iso-os) 1 gram/50 mL Piggyback Sig: One (1) gram Intravenous Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for UTI for 8 days: Last day [**2165-12-24**] for total 14 day course.
