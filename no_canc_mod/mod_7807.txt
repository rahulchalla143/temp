Cataract extraction with lens implants and a right leg wound dehiscence [**2105-6-8**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 50 year-old diabetic, hypertensive male who has a long history of coronary artery disease with a history of multiple myocardial infarctions and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties in the past.
He also has a history of end stage renal disease status post kidney and pancrease transplant in [**2094**] as well as peripheral vascular disease status post bilateral lower extremity bypass grafting.
Catheterization was done at that time, which revealed no significant disease of the left main coronary artery.
The patient is referred for coronary artery bypass graft, however, he has limited useful conduits due to his lower extremity bypass grafting and his left radial artery has already been used for an AV fistula and is no longer patent.
His right radial also being diffusely calcified seemingly with no flow.
Ultrasound of the lower extremities failed to show lesser saphenous on either side.
The patient denies any recent chest discomfort, chest pain or dyspnea on exertion.
However, his activity is limited by his bilateral lower extremity claudication.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted [**2105-7-22**] for an elective angiography of his left internal mammary artery and right internal mammary artery with possible coronary artery bypass grafting.
Cardiac catheterization was performed [**2105-7-23**], which revealed moderate stenoses of the proximal innominate, right subclavian and left subclavian artery with no resting gradient, a patent left internal mammary artery and a peak gradient of 20 mmHg across the left subclavian stenosis with hyperemia.
Also of note the innominate and left subclavian angiography revealed that there was a 50% proximal stenoses of the innominate artery and a 50% osteal right subclavian stenosis.
However, frequent unifocal premature ventricular contractions were seen on arrival ranging from 2 to 15 a minute.
Magnesium was given and the patient was A paced at 100 for ectopy depression with improvement.
The patient's vital signs temperature max 37.7, the patient was afebrile with a heart rate of 96 being E paced.
Renal came by and saw the patient postoperative day one at which time they agreed to low dose ace inhibitor given his coronary artery disease and chronic renal insufficiency and they recommended to follow creatinine and potassium closely.
The patient remained afebrile with vital signs stable and sinus rhythm at 67 with a white count of 6.5, hematocrit 31.2, platelets of 88, sodium 137, potassium 4.1, BUN 42, creatinine 1.7 and a glucose of 94.
The patient remained afebrile in sinus rhythm, vital signs stable.
[**2105-7-29**] the patient was evaluated by EPS for the ICD implantation and on [**2105-7-30**] the patient underwent an AICD placement to his left chest.
[**7-30**], renal came by and saw the patient again at which time they just recommended to continue with current treatment and to continue to check the chemistries and follow Is and Os.
Postoperative day seven [**2105-7-31**] the patient with low grade temperature of 99.4, vital signs stable in sinus rhythm.
Coronary artery disease.
Peripheral vascular disease.
End stage renal disease.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Congestive heart failure.
