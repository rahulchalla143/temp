The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Stable appearance of left parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No new foci of hemorrhage identified (allowing for limitation, above).
Opacification of the ethmoidal air cells and fluid layering within the nasal cavity, bilaterally, and the right maxillary sinus and sphenoid air cell.
Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left with associated compressive atelectasis and non-specific ground-glass opacity in the lungs could represent inflamation or infection.
Hypodensity in the right kidney is incompletely evaluated and could represent a cyst or other lesion, but infarct cannot be excluded.
Umbilical and right-sided inguinal bowel-containing hernias without evidence of obstruction/incarceraction.
Brief Hospital Course: HYPOTENSION/SHOCK: multifactorial - thought secondary to possibly septic picture (given known source of VISA endocarditis) and possible cardiogenic factor.
The patient was started on stress dose steroids given his long standing h/o steroid use.
His home medications for HTN and Afib were held in the setting of hypotension, and cultures were taken for the possible infectious cause.
&#9658; ENDOCARDITIS (VISA): was on synercid at OSH due to Lsided lesion, and as above, his coverage was increased to broad spectrum abx.
&#9658; ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC: likely due to hypoperfusion of the end organs given elevated lactate.
&#9658; SEIZURE vs STROKE: imaging suggest subarachnoid hemorrhage, not for surgical intervention.
His CT chest notable for b/l pleural effusions with RLL segmental collapse.
&#9658; ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB) on Coumadin with high INR - given subarachnoid bleed, he was reversed with profilnine, vitamin K, and FFP.
