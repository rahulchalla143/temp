She remained intubated for 10 days secondary to her open abdomen and volume overload following resuscitation.
The patient then had a slow wean from mechanical ventilation and was intermittently diuresed with Lasix prn and Lasix gtt.
She did spike fevers and had a mildly elevated WBC (12 - 13) which prompted an infectious work-up which revealed an E. coli pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
Ultimately, the patient was discharged to rehab on PODs #25 & 15 tolerating a regular diet, in adequate pain control, afebrile and with a normal white count.
