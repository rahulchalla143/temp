Admission Date:  [**2192-5-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2192-5-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2119-8-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8961**] Chief Complaint: lightheadedness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: central venous catheter insertion   History of Present Illness: 72 y/o woman with recently diagnosed cirrhosis and hemolytic anemia complicated by acute cerebellar hemorrhage now transfered to MICU for further workup and treatmenyt.
She was diagnosed with cryptogenic cirrhosis and hemolytic anemia; outpatient workup by her PCP and hematology including negative Hep serologies, [**Doctor First Name **] <1:40, -ANCA, low C3/C4 and including negative cold agglutinins and negative combs test was unrevealing.
She underwent an outpatient BM biopsy was complicated by bleeding requiring a transfusion.
She was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2192-5-4**] with hypotension (60s systolic); which responded to fluid/PRBC resucsitation.
CT of her abdomen showed liver nodularity suggestive of cirrhosis.
Past Medical History: Hyperlipidemia (simvastatin d/c'd in [**3-2**] after 15months) Hypertension AAA - currently 5.0cm, was 4.3 cm in [**10-30**] COPD - long smoking history, quit 1.5 yrs ago s/p CEA [**2190**] Renal Artery Stenosis on right Chronic Renal Insufficiency Gastric ulcer age 20 "yellow jaundice" age 20 cryptogenic cirrhosis (diagnosis [**2-/2192**]) hemolytic anemia   Social History: Lives with husband in [**Name (NI) **].
No recent travel.
no other drug use  Family History: Mother, stroke age 40 Father: etoh cirrhosis Sister: crytpogenic cirrhosis   Physical Exam: VS: T 101.4, HR 124 (98-130), BP: 210/100 (decreased to ->145/90 with lopressor) (range: 127/52-167/80s), RR: 14, O2: 94% 2L NC (had been 99% 2LNC) GEN: in moderate distress, rigoring, moaning HEENT: MM very dry, +scleral icterus, face symmetric, PERRL CV: RRR, tachy RESP: diminished, poor effort, no focal findings, some upper airway sounds ABD: diffusely tender, not distended, no rebound or guarding EXT: LUE: in ace wrap wrist to shoulder RUE: large hematoma/induration over forearm, quite tender to palpation or movement.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Please note that other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
Cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis.
There is associated vasogenic edema.
There is no compression noted of the fourth ventricle or the cerebellopontine cisterns.
Prominence of the extra-axial CSF spaces is likely due to age-related involutional changes.
There is no evidence of other hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, mass, shift of midline structures, or large vascular territory infarction.
No fractures are seen in the skull.
Small amount of mucosal thickening is seen in the left ethmoidal/sphenoidal region.
Vascular calcifications are noted in the cavernous carotid arteries.
IMPRESSION: Acute hemorrhage at the superior aspect of the cerebellar vermis in the midline likely represents subdural hematoma although possible intraparenchymal component cannot be excluded.
There is associated vasogenic edema.
Currently there is no compression on the fourth ventricle or the cerebellopontine cisterns.
CT HEAD: [**2193-5-12**] The known hyperdense collection along the cerebellar vermis is unchanged compared to the initial CT from [**Month/Day/Year 13835**] 27 hours prior, measuring 3.7 x 2.1 cm.
Again the focus is at the superior aspect of the cerebellar vermis and likely represents subdural hematoma.
There is mild associated vasogenic edema.
No evidence of hydrocephalus.
Age-related involutional changes are again noted.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged subdural hematoma along the cerebellar vermis with associated edema.
No new hemorrhage.
MR HEAD: [**2192-5-14**] FINDINGS: There is an [**Month/Day/Year 13835**] 40 x 22 mm intraparenchyma hematoma in the cerebellar vermis along with surrounding edema.
There is no apparent enhancement within this lesion, and there are no apparent underlying lesions.
Followup MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 13835**] one month after the resolution of the hematoma would be helpful to confirm the absence of underlying pathology.
There are several small high T2 signal foci in the deep and subcortical white matter on FLAIR imaging consistent with small vessel disease.
There is T1 hyperintensity in the basal ganglia suggestive of hepatic insufficiency.
There are no incidental bony or soft tissue abnormalities.
CONCLUSION: Acute cerebellar hematoma with surrounding edema as described above.
There are no apparent areas of enhancement or underlying lesions, and a followup MRI in one month would be helpful to assess resolution and also absence of underlying pathology.
There is no evidence of DVT involving either extremity, there is a focal hematoma medially in the upper left arm.
Brief Hospital Course: 72 y/o woman with HTN, HLP, CRI, COPD, admitted with hemolytic anemia and decompensated ESLD.
On [**5-11**] she developed acute dysarthria; stat head CT showed acute hemorrhage at the superior aspect of the cerebellar vermis.
She also developed a spontaneous large hematoma in her left arm.
Consults included: Neurology and Neurosurgery (for acute SDH- no intervention) Rheumatology (for ?vasculitis, thought unlikely), Hepatology (for cirrhosis, rec outpatient liver f/u, and outpt EGD) Hematology (for hemolytic anemia/coagulopathy, thought to be due to ESLD +/- mild DIC, rec plt goal 80-100, INR goal 1.5-1.7--no note since [**5-14**]) Vascular surgery- no need to intervene on arm hematoma, rec reversal of coagulopathy .
On [**5-16**] she developed GNR bacteremia and ARF, and underwent significant clinical deterioration.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for agitation, anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Cirrhosis/decompensated liver failure Hemolytic anemia DIC subdural hematoma gram negative rod bacteremia acute renal failure   Discharge Condition: guarded   Discharge Instructions: You are being transferred to another hospital per your family's request to be closer to home.
