Admission Date:  [**2133-10-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-10-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-3-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Avapro / Zetia / Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8487**] Chief Complaint: Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 64 yo male with PMH CAD (s/p CABG), AF (on coumadin), DM, HTN, recent admission for presumed drug-induced rhabdomyolysis/weakness resulting in hypercarbic respiratory failure (s/p trach and PEG) and ARF presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Pt was recently admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 60244**] with elevated LFTs, rhabdomyolysis with CK 13,000 and weakness presumed secondary to a combination of zetia and avapro.
Muscle biopsy suggested a metabolic myopathy induced by toxic agents and drugs (i.e cholesterol lowering agents).
No evidence of inflammatory myositis.
Hepatitis serologies negative.
Pt developed hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to muscle weakness and was intubated, then got trach and PEG for failure to extubate in setting of persistently low NIFs.
Per wife, pt was having difficulty tolerating Bipap.
[**Month (only) 116**] have preceding hypercarbic respiratory failure.
No neurologic complications.
Past Medical History: Rhabdomyolosis (presumed [**2-26**] drug toxicity) Respiratory Failure (s/p Trach and PEG) ARF ([**2-26**] contrast nephropathy) IDDM HTN AF on coumadin Gout Hypercholesterolemia Arthritis CAD (s/p CABG) .
[**2133-10-27**]: TTE ECHO: Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is hypokinesis of the basal half of the right ventricular free wall preserved apical systolic function.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The prominent RV cavity enlargement and free wall hypokinesis are similar and underestimated on the prior study and suggestive of a primary pulmonary process (pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, bronchospasm, etc.).
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 64 yo male with recent drug induced rhabdomyolosis/hepatitis complicated by respiratory failure (s/p Trach/PEG) and ARF who is re-admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure: On initial presentation, this was most likely of mutifactorial etiology.
Possibilites included secondary to recent weaning off vent, continued respiratory muscle weakness, increased abdominal girth (compressing diaphragm), and standing sedating medications.
Also, pt has RLL opacity on CXR which may be aspiration pneumonitis vs. early pneumonia.
He was not empirically started on antibitics because of lack of fever or increased WBC count.
On day of discharge, pt was started on Diamox, given his rising bicarb from 31 to 36.
# Anasarca: Most likely secondary to right heart failure.
Urine protein to creatinine ratio was 0.2 with a serum albumin of 3.8 - no evidence for nephrotic syndrome.
Most likely secondary to pulmonary disease - DDx includes intermittent pulmonary vasoconstriction 2/2 episodes of apnea, chronic thromboembolic disease, pulmonary edema.
Less likely secondary to LV dysfunction, given disproportionate RV dysfunction on echo.
Pt needs a right heart cath at some point, once his renal function improves and is stable.
# Elevated Tn: Pt had a Tn of 1.3 on admission, which increased to 2.75.
This is most likely secondary to demand ischemia (more likely RV than LV).
# ARF: Most likely secondary to pre-renal state from being intravascularly dry and underlying diabetic nephropathy.
Pt's Fe Urea was 11%, which is consistent with pre-renal status.
# Anemia: Most likely dilutional in setting of significant total body overload.
No evidence of active bleeding; guiac negative.
Iron studies suggestive of iron deficiency anemia.
Coumadin was held in setting of supratherapeutic INR.
# DM: ISS .
# HTN: continue hydralazine and lopressor .
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypercarbic respiratory failure Anasarca RH Failure ARF Demand ischemia vs. NSTEMI Anemia   Discharge Condition: Stable respiratory status.
Discharge Instructions: Please return to the ED if you develop altered mental status or respiratory distress.
