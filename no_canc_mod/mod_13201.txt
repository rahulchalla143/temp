GENERAL:  DIABETIC FOOT CARE:  Diabetes is a disease in which high blood glucose levels over time can damage the nerves, kidneys, eyes, and blood vessels.
When diabetes is not well controlled, damage to the organs and impairment of the immune system is likely.
With damage to the nervous system, a person with diabetes may not be able to feel his or her feet properly.
These factors together can lead to abnormal pressure on the skin, bones, and joints of the foot during walking and can lead to breakdown of the skin of the foot.
Bacterial infection of the skin, connective tissues, muscles, and bones can then occur.
If the infection spreads to the bloodstream, this process can be life threatening.
People with diabetes must be fully aware of how to prevent foot problems before they occur, to recognize problems early, and to seek the right treatment when problems do occur.
Although treatment for diabetic foot problems has improved, prevention, including good control over blood sugar, remains the best way to prevent problems.
Diabetics should learn how to examine their own feet and how to recognize the early signs and symptoms of diabetic foot problems.
RISK FACTORS:  These risk factors increase your chances of developing foot problems and diabetic infections in your legs and feet if you are diabetic.
Footwear:  Poorly fitting shoes are a common cause of diabetic foot problems.
If you have red spots, sore spots, blisters, corns, calluses, or consistent pain associated with wearing your shoes, you need to get new, properly fitting footwear as soon as possible.
If you have common foot abnormalities such as flat feet, bunions, or hammertoes, you may need prescription shoes or shoe inserts.
Nerve damage:  People with long-standing or poorly controlled diabetes are at risk for having damage to the nerves in their feet.
The medical term for this is peripheral neuropathy.
Also you may be unable to sense the position of your feet and toes while walking and balancing.
The diabetic may not properly perceive minor injuries (such as cuts, scrapes, blisters), signs of abnormal wear and tear (that turn into calluses and corns), and foot strain.
Normally, people can feel if there is a stone in their shoe and remove it immediately.
Smoking:  Smoking any form of tobacco causes damage to the small blood vessels in the feet and legs.
This damage can disrupt the healing process and is a major risk factor for infections and amputations.
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS:  Persistent pain can be a symptom of sprain, strain, bruise, overuse, improperly fitting shoes, or underlying infection.
Redness can be a sign of infection, especially when surrounding a wound, or of abnormal rubbing of shoes or socks.
Swelling of the feet or legs can be a sign of underlying inflammation or infection, improperly fitting shoes, or poor venous circulation.
Other signs of poor circulation:  Pain in your legs or buttocks that increases with walking and improves with rest (the medical term is claudication)  Hair no longer growing on the lower legs and feet  Hard shiny skin on the legs  Localized warmth can be a sign of infection or inflammation, perhaps from wounds that won't heal or are slow to heal.
Any break in the skin is serious and can be from abnormal wear and tear, injury, or infection.
Calluses and corns may be a sign of chronic trauma to your foot.
Drainage of pus from a wound is usually a sign of infection.
Persistent bloody drainage is also a sign of a potentially serious [**Last Name 4241**] problem.
A limp or difficulty walking can be sign of joint problems, serious infection, or improperly fitting shoes.
Fever or chills in association with a wound on the foot can be a sign of a limb- or life-threatening infection.
Red streaking away from or redness spreading out from a wound is a sign of a progressively worsening infection.
New or lasting numbness in your feet or legs can be a sign of nerve damage from diabetes and increases your risk for leg and foot problems.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4242**] moisturizer to prevent dry skin and cracking.
Wear cotton or wool socks.
If you have difficulty with your vision or using your hands, let your doctor do it for you or train a family member how to do it safely.
If you have flat feet, bunions, or hammertoes, you may need prescription shoes or shoe inserts.
Smoking accelerates damage to blood vessels, especially small blood vessels leading to poor circulation, which is a major risk factor for foot infections and ultimately amputations.
WHEN TO CALL THE DOCTOR:  Write down your symptoms and be prepared to talk about them on the phone with your doctor.
Following is a list of common reasons to call your doctor if you have a diabetic foot or leg problem.
Persistent mild-to-moderate pain in your feet or legs is a signal that something is wrong.
Constant pain is never normal.
Any new blister, wound, or ulcer less than 1 inch across can become a more serious problem.
Any new areas of warmth, redness, or swelling on your feet or legs are frequently early signs of infection or inflammation.
Pain, redness, or swelling around a toenail could mean you have an ingrown toenail?????
?a leading cause of diabetic foot infections and amputations.
New or constant numbness in your feet or legs can be a sign of diabetic nerve damage (neuropathy) or of impaired circulation in your legs.
Both conditions put you at risk for serious problems such as infections and amputations.
Difficulty walking can result from diabetic arthritis (Charcot's joints), often a sign of abnormal strain or pressure on the foot or of poorly fitting shoes.
Constant itching in the feet can be a sign of fungal infection or dry skin, both of which can lead to infection.
?F, in association with any other symptoms or even fever alone should prompt an immediate call to your doctor.
The degree of fever does not always correlate with the seriousness of infection.
You could have no fever or a very low fever and still have a serious infection.
People with diabetes need to be especially cautious of fever.
Following are some common reasons to seek immediate medical attention for diabetic foot and leg problems.
Severe pain in your feet or legs is often a sign of acute loss of circulation to the leg, serious infection, or may be due to severe nerve damage (neuropathy).
Any cut to your feet or legs that bleeds significantly and goes all the way through the skin needs proper cleaning and repair to aid healing.
Any significant puncture wounds to your feet (for example, stepping on a nail or being bitten by a dog or cat) carry a high risk of becoming infected.
Wounds or ulcers that are more than about 1 inch across on your feet or legs are frequently associated with limb-threatening infections.
Redness or red streaks spreading away from a wound or ulcer on your feet or legs are a sign of infection spreading through the tissues.
?F in association with redness, swelling, warmth, or any wound or ulcer on your legs may be a sign of a limb or life-threatening infection.
If you have diabetes and you simply have a fever more than 101.5??????
Because the degree of fever does not always correlate with the seriousness of the illness, people with diabetes should take even low-grade fevers (less than 101.5?????
Alteration in mental status (confusion) may be a sign of life-threatening infection that could lead to loss of a leg or foot, when associated with a leg wound or foot ulcer.
It may also be a sign of either very high or very low blood sugars, which are more common when there is infection present.
PREVENTION:  Prevention of diabetic foot problems involves a combination of factors.
Follow all of your doctor's or nurse's instructions.
Shrinkage of the wound or ulcer is a good sign.
Absence of fever is also generally a good sign.
Be especially vigilant about your diabetes care while you are healing a foot or leg infection.
Check your blood sugar regularly and let your doctor know of any pattern of lows or highs.
