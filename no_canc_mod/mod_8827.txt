He developed pain in his chest with pressure, about [**8-20**] pain.
The pain radiated to his neck.
He denied nausea and vomiting.
However, he did have some shortness of breath.
The patient blamed his persistent chest pain on muscle strain.
The primary care physician did an EKG which showed ST elevations anteriorly and he was sent by EMS to the [**Hospital1 1474**] Emergency Department.
In the Emergency Department there, he was noted to have anterior and lateral ST elevations, given aspirin and sublingual nitroglycerin, and transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for cardiac catheterization.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for a father with a CABG in his 60s and diabetes in his mother and maternal aunt.
Denies shortness of breath and wheezing.
Also denies GERD symptoms, claudication.
He says he has moderately poor exertional ability.
Cardiovascular - regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
He had Q waves in V1 through V4 and II, III and S.  ST elevations 1 mm in II and S, 4 mm in V2, V3 and F4, and 3 mm in V5, 2 mm in V6.
HISTORY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient went for a cardiac catheterization on the day of admission which showed an ejection fraction of 35%, apical and anterolateral hypokinesis.
It showed RA mean pressure of 14, RV pressure 33/13, PA pressure 33/18 with a mean of 26, wedge 18, left ventricular pressure 103/20, cardiac output 3.6, cardiac index 1.8, SVR 1579 and peripheral vascular resistance 178.
His catheterization also showed one-vessel disease, left main, no stenosis.
He had a distal left anterior descending ulcerated 90% stenotic lesion past the origin of diagonal-2 and occluded with thrombus at the origin of D-3.
He also had moderate systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
1) CARDIOVASCULAR COURSE - MYOCARDIUM:  The patient is status post an anterior wall MI, now with an ejection fraction of 35% and anterior and apical hypokinesis.
The patient was decided to be placed on coumadin for six months for his apical and anterolateral hypokinesis, as well as his anterior MI.
However, after much discussion with the team it was decided that his lipid levels may be falsely decreased in a setting of an acute myocardial infarction.
2) PULMONARY:  The patient continued to sat well on room air and no issues.
He says that at this time he would like to try doing without any nicotine patches or medications.
However, he says he will follow-up with his primary care physician if he has any difficulties quitting smoking.
3) RENAL:  The patient had no renal issues during admission.
He will also have VNA services come to his home to assist him with his new medications and adjustment to his decreased ventricular function and new myocardial infarction.
2) Acute anterior myocardial infarction.
