He was in his usual state of health until about 1 week prior to admission when he began to develop mild epigastric discomfort, pain [**1-30**], lasting most of the day while at work.
The symptoms became slightly more severe on the day of admission, and he went to see his cardiologist.
Then, at 8PM at night while mopping the floor, he developed severe [**11-8**] substernal CP without radiation followed by diaphoresis, dizziness, and nausea.
He presented to OSH with CP and bradycardia to 49 as well as borderline low BP 103/54, RR 20.
EKG with mild ST elevations in II,III,AVF, mild ST depressions in I, AVL.
He was found to have: R dominant LMCA: normal LAD: 30% proximal disease RCA: total proximal occlusion .
Upon transfer to CCU, pt reports [**2173-1-30**] epigastric discomfort similar to his symptoms from several days ago.
His major complaint is dry mouth.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
On review of symptoms, + loud snoring and feeling tired during the day.
He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Past Medical History: HTN Dyslipidemia diabetes: diagnosed 5 years ago GERD Sciatica  Social History: Pt works as construction worker during day.
He is married Smoking: 80 pack years (2ppd X 40 years) EtOH: rare over last 5 years   Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Mother had heart disease and DM.
Brother has DM, but no hx of MI   Physical Exam: VS: T97.3 , BP 144/51 , HR 55 , RR 16, O2 % on Gen: middle aged male, obese.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No murmurs Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP  Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP  Pertinent Results: EKG demonstrated bradycardia with ectopic atrial, nl axis, nl intervals <1mm ST elev in II, III, AVF, mild ST depressions in I, AVL, TWI in AVF .
The LMCA had no angiographically-apparent disease.
The LCx had no angiographically-apparent disease.
The RCA had a total proximal occlusion.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left filling  pressures with RVEDP of 15 mmHg and mean PCW of 25 mmHg.
There was moderate pulmonary arterial pressure with PASP of 40 mmHg.
Successful treatment of inferior STEMI with stenting of proximal RCA with a Vision 3x15mm bare metal stent.
Prior to intervention patient had bradycardia, relative hypotension and strong vagal reaction necessitating use of transvenous pacer.
Inferior STEMI 3.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Moderate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Successful stenting of RCA with bare metal stent.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild focal left ventricular systolic dysfunction with overall preserved EF   Brief Hospital Course: On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was already loaded with plavix, and on integrillin and heparin drips.
His EKG and clinical presentation were consistent with a right-sided myocardial infarction, as he had mild ST elevations in II, III, and AVF with an ectopic atrial rhythm; bradycardia, and hypotension.
He was immediately taken to the cath lab where he was found to have total proximal RCA occlusion, with 30% proximal LAD disease.
A post-cath echocardiogram was obtained which showed segmental wall motion abnormalities in distribution of his MI, with preserved overall LV function (EF >55%).
Over the course of his hospitalization, his heart rate improved to the 60-75 range and he returned to his pre-hospitalization hypertensive state.
