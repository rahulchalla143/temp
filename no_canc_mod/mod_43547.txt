2 days PTA she developed anorexia and nausea associated with poor oral intake, had a few episodes of non-bloody vomiting and [**9-30**] non-bloody episodes of diarrhea.
She has not had fever, chills, URI symptoms, abdominal pain, sick contacts, recent antibiotics (other than PO vanco) or recent travel.
weight gain and has felt more lethargic, reportedly similar to how she has during past episodes of fluid retention.
She was given just 1 L NS in light of severe systolic dysfunction.
She had minimal urine output.
CXR revealed bilat effusions R>L and cephalization c/w CHF.
Abd/pelvis CT w/o contrast preliminarily showed intraperitoneal free fluid and colonic wall thickening predominantly on the right c/w third-spacing or infectious colitis.
She was transferred to the ICU for observation and further management of CHF and ARF.
In the ICU, patient had a TTE which showed worsening of her EF to 15%, pulmonary hypertension, and severe aortic stenosis.

The findings are suggestive of congestive heart failure.
A left-sided unipolar cardiac pacemaker is seen with the tip projected over the right ventricle.
There are degenerative changes noted in the thoracic spine.
CT ABD/PELVIS w/o contrast (prelim) - large right pleural effusion and small left effusion with right lower lobe opacity could reflect atelectasis or pneumonia; intraperitoneal free fluid and colonic wall thickening predominantly on the right, could reflect third spacing other differential includes infectious colitis, including C diff.
Study not equipped for evaluation of bowel ischemia due to lack of IV contrast which remains in the differential .
TTE [**7-5**] - The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2).
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior wall, mild hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral, lateral and anterolateral segments and severe hypokinesis of the other segments.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity.
Mild to moderate ([**12-21**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is a small posterior pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
The degrees of valvular abnormalities are similar.
There is a small pericardial effusion seen on the current study that was present on the prior but not mentioned in the report.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 86 y/o F h/o CAD, CHF, DM, AFib hypertherapeutic on coumadin, and chronic c. diff colitis on recently elevated dose of PO vanco a/w vomiting and diarrhea with evidence of colitis, and acute on chronic renal failure in the setting of escalating diuresis.
#Acute on chronic renal failure - Patient presented with acute on chronic renal failure.
#Acute on chronic systolic heart failure - TTE revealed worsened valve and LV function c/w exam [**9-24**]; substantial pleural effusions but no respiratory compromise.
CEs negative, ECG unchanged, no new findings on TTE so unlikely recent ischemic event precipiated this decompensation.
# possible Burisitis- patient with reproducible pain with lifting left leg, but not with bending left knee localized to top of femur, likely musculoskeletal, ordered x-rays soft tissue/ bone to reassure daughter (no like pain in right leg) - femur xr showed degenerative changes, f/u as outpt .
UTI: Patient had a U/A yesterday which showed moderate leukocytes, small blood, few bacteria, and <1 epi.
Patient had foley removed.
- unclear i/o's since pt is incontinent, but foley was removed earlier due to possible UTI - cipro given d [**2-20**] .
# Bilat pleural effusion/RLL opacity - likely transudative effusions in the setting of decompensated CHF, cannot exclude underlying PNA but low suspicion since no fever or leukocytosis; stable resp.
in light of h/o c. diff) -blood Cx still pending .
#N/V/D - suspect viral etiology as has not had vomiting with prior episodes of c. diff; no c/o pain, benign abdominal exam, and supratherapeutic INR makes ischemia/thrombosis less likely; lactate trending down.
#Anemia - Hct 32, b/l ~38; no s/sx bleeding but GI tract most likely source; has polyps on prior colonoscopies; on Fe replacement for chronic anemia, likely element of ACD as well.
- Transfuse for Hct <21% - Monitor daily Hct - Guiac stools  \, on d.c, guiac negative, h/h has significant lab variation, no clincal problems .
#AFib - V-paced -holding coumadin with supratherapeutic INR .
#CAD - no ischemic changes on EKG and negative troponins x3 -cont.
# SW issues/ elder abuse - Her daughter would like for her to live with her again and will be hiring two caretakers to watch over the patient.
# Disposition: To Rehab.
