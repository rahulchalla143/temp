CXR showed a resolving right-sided pleural effusion.
He had 1 episode of bradycardia to the 30s and received atropine 0.5 mg.
He was admitted for further management of bradycardia and hypotension.

[**6-4**] CT ABD and Pelvis - prelim read Stranding in the mesentery is likley related to fluid overload, without evidence of large abscess or hemorrhage.
male with h/o syncope with falls, afib,  recent humerus fx is s/p pna with known large right pleural effusion, presents with lethargy and weakness found to be bradycardic and hypotensive .
# Bradycardia: Unclear etiology as not on BB, CCB or digoxin.
Unclear if patient's bradycardia and hypotension were trully related.
Was in slow atrial fibrillation on admission.. Likely age-related sclerotic conduction system disease.
# Hypotension: No focal infectious etiology.
Perhaps volume depletion secondary to diarrhea.
# ARF: Likely pre-renal in etiology given recent diarrhea versus ATN given hypotension.
He had loose stools on his last admission as well that were attributed to narcotic withdrawl and antibiotics and chronic stool softner use.
# Diastolic CHF: Patient has received 9 L IVF.
No LE edema, but does have pleural effusion and abdominal edema.
# Pleural effusion: He has had a loculated pleural effusion in setting of recent pna, possible parapneuomnic effusion vs transudate from right heart failure.
No fevers, no elevtaed WBC to suggest active infection.
not anticoagulated secondary to patients wishes.
# h/o Humerus fx:  tylenol PRN .
# FEN: regular heart healthy diet, nectar thickened liquids .
