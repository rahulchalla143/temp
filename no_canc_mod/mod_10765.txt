Over the past three weeks had increasing abdominal girth, fevers or chills, and fatigue.
He has had positive rectal bleeding over the last week and on the day of admission had episodes of hematemesis.
He presented to [**Hospital3 **] where he had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which revealed positive esophageal and gastric varices with a clot in the stomach, but no active bleeding.
He has had increasing confusion over the past two days prior to admission as well.
He has had increasing lower extremity swelling over the past week for which he had been taking Ibuprofen for pain.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Esophageal varices.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Plus fetor hepatis.
Abdomen distended, positive splenomegaly.
The patient received an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on the morning after admission, which revealed esophageal and gastric varices with stigmata of recent bleeding.
On that same day in the evening the patient underwent an episode of hematemesis again.
The patient received another emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which revealed some bleeding from the esophageal varices.
The patient did not have any further episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding while in the hospital.
The patient had two large bore intravenous in place at all time and required 2 units of packed red blood cells while in the hospital for gastrointestinal bleeding, but no further blood products.
The patient had an ultrasound with doppler studies showing reversible flow in the portal vein, recannulization of the umbilical vein, small cirrhotic liver with no masses.
The decision to have a TIPS procedure was deferred as the patient was unstable hemodynamically and had severe encephalopathy.
The patient received Lactulose and Propanolol for liver failure and portal hypertension.
The patient had a mild coagulopathy with an INRs at 1.7 to 1.8 range, which were corrected somewhat by administration of vitamin K.  The patient required no further fresh frozen platelets while in the hospital.
Alcohol withdraw:  The patient was monitored closely for alcohol withdraw / DTs and was maintained on an Ativan drip and a CIWA scale while in the hospital.
Neurological:  The patient had an episode of anisocoria on day four of the hospitalization.
The patient received an urgent head CT, which revealed no acute bleeds.
The patient was evaluated by the neurology service, which suggested that the patient had a temporary Horner's syndrome due to hematoma at his right internal jugular central venous catheter site.
The degree of hepatic encephalopathy could not be assessed as the patient was intubated and sedated for much of his hospital course.
The patient developed fevers and aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis from hematemesis and aspiration of blood was considered, however, serial chest x-rays revealed no suspicious infiltrates.
The patient was continued on MDI therapy for his asthma as well as steroids for suspected asthma.
Acidosis:  The patient was slightly alkalemic on admission with a pH of 7.45, however, he became more and more acidemic throughout the hospital course with eventual pHs of 7.23.
