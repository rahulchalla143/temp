PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES FROM THE OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  The lumbar puncture under fluoroscopy showed no organisms.
RADIOLOGY:  As stated before, a head computer tomography and KUB - per outside hospital - were also negative.
A chest x-ray showed no acute process.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 65-year-old gentleman with a 3-day history of fever of unknown origin with rigors, chills, tachypnea, and episodes of tachycardia with delirium who was admitted from an outside hospital.
The patient was initially worked up because of the rales found on his physical examination as well as some signs suggestive of either congestive heart failure or pneumonia found on chest x- ray.
He was initially diagnosed with pneumonia and was started on Levaquin and Flagyl for a possible aspiration pneumonia.
The patient continued to have these rigor episodes while on Levaquin and Flagyl, and other etiologies were  also pursued.
As the only imaging not done at the outside hospital - including his abdomen and with a history of uric acid stones and questionable picture of urosepsis, the patient received a computer tomography of the abdomen which showed a left portal vein septic thrombus.
During the first day of his admission, the patient had one episode of rigors and chills which lasted for one hour with a temperature to 105 - per axillary [**Location (un) 1131**]- as well as tachycardia into the 140s (which was normal sinus).
The patient was normalized within one hour with a normal temperature, a normal heart rate, and not having any oxygen requirement at all.
While in the Intensive Care Unit the patient was seen by Surgery who did not feel that the patient had any acute surgical needs.
He continued to spike fevers to 101 while in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit; although, he did not have any of his rigorous episodes.
The patient continued to have crackles at bibasilar base.
Because of the correlation with chest x-ray it was later assumed to be congestive heart failure either from diastolic dysfunction from his tachycardia or an underlying congestive heart failure picture; that was also given to using gentamicin, Flagyl, and ampicillin.
Throughout his hospital course, the patient - after being in the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit for 24 hours being afebrile - was sent back up to the floor.
While upon the floor, the patient was afebrile for at least 48 hours.
He never complained of abdominal pain.
Of note, the patient never did complain of abdominal pain on admission or while in the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit.
The patient's white blood cell count had normalized, and the patient did not have any rigorous episodes his initial presentation.
Because a left portal vein thrombus is not very common occurrence, and because the literature is very sparse in terms of the most efficacious treatment, the patient is going to be on Levaquin and Flagyl for coverage for anaerobes and gastrointestinal flora and will be given Lovenox and Coumadin for anticoagulation to dissolve the clot.
Computer tomography findings were also suggestive of a resolving diverticulitis that may have led to this left portal vein thrombus.
The patient stated he had recently had a colonoscopy which showed a diverticulosis and was unaware of what the correct diet for a patient with diverticulosis should be.
The patient notes that he frequent servings of nuts and popcorn before admission, but he did not recall any acute diverticulitis type symptoms before presentation of the rigors to the outside hospital.
Blood cultures from the outside hospital confirmed anaerobic bottles grew out Prevotella melaninogenica and Bacteroides fragilis, but no blood cultures or urine cultures from in house have grown any organisms.
The workup for any liver manifestations of his diverticulitis and left portal vein thrombus were also worked up; although, his liver function tests at the highest were in the 60s, and upon discharge were in the 50s and 30s.
The patient did not show any laboratory values of an obstructive bile pathology as his bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase were normal throughout his admission.
Three days prior to discharge, the patient noted have some loose stools - about two to three per day - which were green in color; although not watery in consistency.
A Clostridium difficile toxin times two were negative before discharge, and the patient did not have any diarrhea on the day of discharge.
The patient also understood that he was to have his INR and liver function tests checked and have a computer tomography of the abdomen in the future.
The patient was also given a prescription for hypercoagulability laboratories which are to be drawn at the [**Location (un) 448**] of the [**Hospital 469**] Clinic Laboratory before he presents to the hematologist.
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Degenerative joint disease.
History of recurrent urate stones.
The patient was instructed to have to have blood drawn for aspartate aminotransferase and alanine-aminotransferase in two weeks; and then in four weeks at Adelboro Laboratory and have the results telephoned or faxed to his primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
The patient was instructed to follow the advice of his primary care physician regarding medication changes if necessary, as the patient is on Lovenox, Coumadin, and chronic antibiotics.
These laboratories should include C protein, S protein, antithrombin III lupus anticoagulant, homocystine, and factor V Leiden.
