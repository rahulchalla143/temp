HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 46 year old female with a history of postpartum dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of about 15% who was recently admitted for congestive heart failure exacerbation.
The patient was totally asymptomatic at the time without any chest pain or shortness of breath.
The patient was also noted to have decreased urine output.
An echocardiogram was obtained and showed an unchanged ejection fraction with global left ventricular hypokinesis and akinesis.
Currently, the patient states that she is less short of breath, but is still very short of breath while in the supine position.
The patient had acute respiratory distress while in the Catheterization Laboratory when placed in the supine position.
The patient denies any chest pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers or chills.
Postpartum dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 15%.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Chronic renal failure with baseline creatinine of 2.0.
History of hepatitis B and C. 9.
Stress test from [**2121-2-4**] showed mild to moderate reversible inferior wall defect.
In general, the patient is moderately short of breath.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
Slightly tender in right lower quadrant, no rebound or guarding.
Extremities with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
LABORATORY:  EKG with sinus tachycardia, left bundle branch block which is old, no changes.
Echocardiogram from [**2122-7-20**], ejection fraction less than 15%, severe left ventricular systolic depression with akinetic anterior septum, hypokinesis/akinesis of anterior wall, inferior wall and apex.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient is a 46 year old female with a history of post partum cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of about 15% and diabetes mellitus, who presents after Visiting Nurses Association noticed systolic blood pressure of 70.
She was noted to a have acute on chronic renal failure with a bump in her creatinine from 2.0 to 5.1 in just several days.
PUMP:  With the patient's ejection fraction of 15%, and the elevated capillary wedge pressure, she was felt to be in cardiogenic shock with her decreased blood pressure.
The patient was also kept on Dobutamine as an ianotropic given her severely depressed left ventricular function in the setting of cardiogenic shock.
The patient was Swan-ed for hypotension on [**2122-7-25**].
However, her SVR was only 480, consistent with a septic like picture.
Of note, the patient is not a candidate for heart transplant.
Beta blockers were held secondary to hypotension.
It is unclear if the patient even has active cardiac disease.
She does have diabetes mellitus which is a cardiac coronary artery disease equivalent.
There was no ischemic event to explain the patient's worsened cardiogenic shock.
HYPOTENSION:  The patient's hypotension was initially thought to be secondary to cardiogenic shock.
There was no initial cardiac index calculated when she was first given a Swan in the Catheterization Laboratory on [**2122-7-20**].
The Neo-Synephrine had to be titrated up to a maximum of 5, however, this led to a decrease in urine output.
The patient was given Benadryl and Zantac for treatment of any possible systemic allergic reaction.
Because of her hypotension and fever, she was stared on empiric Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
The patient also received a dose of intravenous Dexamethasone both to cover any adrenal insufficiency and for any possible allergic systemic reaction.
After about 24 hours, the patient started growing Gram positive cocci from her blood cultures drawn peripherally and from her left sided arterial line.
This was consistent with a septic like picture superimposed on a cardiogenic picture.
RENAL:  The patient presented with acute on chronic renal failure.
The patient's chronic renal failure is likely secondary to a combination of diabetes mellitus and her depressed left ventricular function.
The patient's current acute on chronic renal failure is likely secondary to cardiogenic shock.
The patient was found to be prerenal by her FENA secondary to poor perfusion.
The patient did receive a renal ultrasound which showed right and left kidney sizes of 9 centimeters.
There was no hydronephrosis or stones identified.
The patient never came close to requiring any emergent dialysis for ultra-filtration.
The patient grew four out of four bottles of Gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters, which was identified as Staphylococcus aureus.
This was noted to have some pus at the end.
In addition, the patient's left arterial line was taken out as blood cultures drawn from that line also grew Staphylococcus aureus.
The patient's iron studies are consistent with iron deficiency anemia, although the patient likely also has a low epo state given her chronic renal failure.
The patient's pain was controlled with standing Tylenol and p.r.n.
The patient's pain overall improved.
