Admission Date:  [**2156-4-5**]     Discharge Date:  [**2128-3-8**]  Date of Birth:   [**2115-7-19**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 40 year-old lady with a long history of intractable epilepsy beginning in [**2133**] suffering from both simple, complex partial and generalized seizures.
1) Her simple partial seizures  are  somatosensory in nature with numbness and tingling over the left face and arm.
3) Her  generalized tonic clonic seizures mostly occur during the night, averaging once every other week.
Her last generalized tonic clonic seizure occurred three days prior to admission in her sleep with severe tongue [**Last Name (un) 20694**].
Prior to that episode, she had a six to seven minute generalized tonic clonic seizure with aura while shopping with her husband present.
[**Name2 (NI) **] generalized seizures are very different in appearance according to her husband.
Her workup for this elective admission included a PET scan which demonstrated hypometabolism in the right medial temporal lobe.
She also underwent neuropsychological testing which showed average intellectural abilities, but  relative difficulty with test of attention and processing speed.
MRI demonstrated polymicrogyria involving the insula with frontal and parietal operculum on the right side.
Pertinent findings on physical examination is as follows, the patient was an obese female lying in bed in no acute distress.
Neck was supple with no carotid bruits.
Extremities the patient had no clubbing, cyanosis or edema with 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
The patient had no apraxia, neglect, or frontal signs.
On cranial nerve examination the patient had a visual acuity of 20/20.
On reflex examination the patient had 2+ out of 4 reflexes bilaterally with down going toes bilaterally.
The patient was transferred in stable condition with head dressing changed by Neurosurgery on a daily basis.
From a neurology perspective the patient's medications were tapered to induce seizures and aid in localization of her seizures.
The patient's baseline video electroencephalogram showed 11 Hz alpha rhythm with sharp features across the A4 to A6, B4 to B6 electrodes with no electrographic seizure recorded.
The patient's leads were maintained by the epilepsy team after a right craniotomy to achieve the right temporal lobe exposure and include the frontal and parietal regions.
Strips were placed to cover the surface of the anterior temporal lobe extending toward the anterior portion of the hippocampus and amygdala.
The theta frequency spike and wave [**Month/Day (3) 20697**] evolve in the posterior temporal leads into  high frequency high amplitude 32 ms [**First Name (Titles) 20698**] [**Last Name (Titles) 20697**] seen in the A1-A8, B1-B8 contacts as well as the anterior and posterior strips along the temporal lobe.
