Pregnancy was complicated by diagnosis of gastroschisis on routine ultrasound at 18 weeks confirmed by level 2 ultrasound.
Subsequent ultrasounds began to show mild dilatation of single intestinal loops and most recently ultrasounds have shown more dilation with diffuse intestinal wall thickening.
No calcifications have been noted and fetal status has been otherwise reassuring with normal amniotic fluid volumes.
Pregnancy has been otherwise uncomplicated and maternal history is notable for prior elective pregnancy termination.
Due to increasing concerns for intestinal integrity on ultrasounds the mother was taken for [**Name (NI) 32007**] today.
A large gastroschisis was noted with protrusion of a long segment of the small and large intestine and a small amount of stomach.
Bowel was mostly pink with mild duskiness in some areas.
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 37079**] was placed for decompression and suctioning of large amounts of bilious fluids and the infant was maintained on blow-by oxygen.
The infant was active and vigorous, well developed, in moderate respiratory distress with agitation.
Neck was supple without lesions.
Chest was well aerated and coarse with mild to moderate retractions.
Cardiac was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs and femoral pulses 2+ and symmetric.
Abdomen was soft without hepatosplenomegaly or masses noted.
Large gastroschisis was secured in the bag with a small amount of serosanguineous drainage noted.
Genitalia was abnormal female.
IMPRESSION:  Newborn 34-1/7 week infant with large gastroschisis.
Infant has moderate distress.
A normal saline bolus of 10 cc per kilo was given due to presumed fluid loss.
CBC and blood culture were sent and ampicillin and gentamicin were begun for empiric coverage.
Infant was then transported to [**Hospital3 28900**] 7 North in a transport isolette after being shown to the parents.
