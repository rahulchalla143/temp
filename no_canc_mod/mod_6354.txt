Brief Hospital Course: This is a 58 yo woman with cirrhosis [**1-22**] to sarcoidosis complicated by esophageal varices and a failed TIPS procedure attempted in in [**12-26**] who presents from an OSH for evaluation of worsening pleural effusions (s/p L thoracentesis on [**3-4**] at OSH).
*  Pleural Effusion (presented w/ CP, tachycardia, & SOB)--likely hepatic hydrothorax [**1-22**] to cirrhosis and ascites (requires therapeutic paracentesis every week).
Ddx also includes hypoalbuminemia (albumin 2.7 on [**3-6**]) vs. pulmonary complication of sarcoidosis vs. possible infectious process (WBC not elevated, afebrile) vs. malignancy (no recent Hx of weight loss) vs. recent onset diastolic dysfunction [**1-22**] sarcoidosis (new Echo results pending) vs. heart failure [**1-22**] pericardial effusion (seen on MRI, slight PR depressions on EKG).
No h/o heart failure (most recent echo in [**1-26**] shows normal LV function), cardiac enzymes negative X 3, Pt is s/p Right-sided thoracentesis on [**3-9**] in which 1.5 L of fluid was taken off--she was repleted with 12 g of albumin following her procedure.
Follow-up CXR showed no significant change in bilateral pleural effusions and no pneumothorax.
However, the serum-albumin gradient is > 1.2 meeting criteria for a transudative process.
Pulmonary was consulted regarding her recurrent pleural effusions--they opine that effusions are likely transudative [**1-22**] to asctes, but would like to r/o malignancy and diastolic heart dysfunction.
Pleural biopsy showed inflammation, but no granulomas, no malignancy was identified.
Pleural effusions were shown to be stable by multiple xrays.
Patient does retain some degree of dyspnea most likely due to atelectasis and deconditioning.
Pericardial effusion: Earlier in the week, Mrs. [**Known lastname 496**] was noted so be a bit more hypotensive and a bit more short of breath.
An Echocardiogram revealed a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion with right atrial collapse during diastole.
This could have been low intravascular volume or early tamponade.
RHC showed low filling pressures (PCWP 11, CVP 7, PAP 22/5).
This was NOT felt to be tamponade physiology.
*  Cirrhosis/Ascites--[**1-22**] sarcoid liver disease--patient has persistently elevated Tbili & AlkPhos and slightly elevated AST.
Thrombocytopenia and hypoalbuminemia indicate synthetic dysfunction.
Initially, abdominal U/S shows a large amount of ascites--the ascites chemistries are notable for only 5% PMNs arguing against a bacterial infection.
Abdominal/Pelvic MRI showed attenuated patent main and right portal veins, a very thin vessel within the left lobe that may represent a recanalized left portal vein, (however, connection with the main portal vein is not appreciated), an attenuated but patent SMV, and a widely patent splenic vein.
Patient has grade II varices, s/p 1 banding, was due for the second banding, not performed during this admission due to complicated medical situation.
*  h/o bacteremia (Blood Cx Staph Aureus Coag + on [**2160-12-2**])/thigh abcesses (wound cx positive for Strep Milleri on [**2160-12-19**]) [**1-22**] ?endocarditis --Vancomycin was D/C on [**3-13**] as MRI showed interval resolution of the multiple fluid collections within the right thigh as compared to imaging done on [**2161-1-16**].
So, in summary:  58 yo woman with hepatic sarcoid.
Diagnosed with pulmonary sarcoid in [**2151**], stopped chronic Prednisone for pulmonary sarcoid in [**2155**] as per the pulmonary clinc.
Had esophageal variceal bleed in [**3-25**] requiring banding.
Developed presumed endocarditis and R thigh abscess (cx grew out Strep milleri, TTE negative for vegetations) in [**11-24**].
Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2161-1-13**] to [**2161-2-6**] for elective TIPS placement due to esophageal varices.
This was attempted but not successful due to distal main PV clot and clotted intrahepatic portal veins.
She became hypotensive peri-TIPS procedure, requiring stay in ICU.
During admission, had pretransplant evaluation, and right thigh abscess was reassessed, right thigh MRI showed decreased size of abscess, with no fluid collection that was amenable to drainage by radiology.
Presented to Hospital in [**State 1727**] on [**2161-3-3**] with 1 day chest pain and shortness of breath.
Found to have bilateral pleural effusions, which were tapped.
During long [**2161-1-13**] to [**2161-2-6**] hospital course, would typically get progressively short of breath as abdominal ascites reaccumulated, and generally needed a large volume paracentesis about once a week, when more than 3 L was removed, became hypotensive despite pre procedure Albumin, requiring short ICU stays.
Last LVP at [**Hospital1 18**] was 4.5 L and tolerated OK. Shortness of breath was different from when ascites reaccumulated, chest pain is new, does not feel like her usual GERD pain.
Large volume paracentesis.
Recurrent exudative pleural effusions, also small-mod pericardial effusion, ?hepatic hydrothorax vs. other process.
Repeat MRI of thigh showed resolution of thigh abscess and now off abx.
Has had low BP, hyponatremia.
Holding off on diuretics due to dehydration.
Bursts of atrial tachycardia and increased pulsus.
Trnasferred to CCU for Swan to check pressure and R/O tamponade.
PA diastolic pressures low suggesting underfilling.
Stable from hepatology standpoint, ascites small, no peripheral edema, continuing to hold diuretics.
Had slight drop in blood pressure, Nadolol held, afebrile.
Still dyspneic, hypoxic, CXR showed persistent pleural effusion.
Card: fluid restriction Pulm: W/U for other serositis [**3-30**] ECHO: small pericardial effusion [**3-30**] US: mod ascites [**3-31**] card MRI: pending Plan: Patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to discuss further options about liver transplantation, esophageal banding and sbp prophylaxis, since last abdominal ultrasound showed re-accumulating ascites.
Vancomycin 750 mg Q 24H for right thigh abscess which needs to be continued for 8-10 weeks (started at end of [**December 2160**]) 2.
