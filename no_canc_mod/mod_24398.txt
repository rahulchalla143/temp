On morning of transfer, patient had complained of mild burning sternal chest pain at outside hospital.
Patient was initially scheduled for aortic valve replacement on [**2132-10-22**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], but it was postponed in the setting of COPD exacerbation and recurrent herpes genitalis.

**FINAL REPORT [**2132-10-25**]**    Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2132-10-25**]):       NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
Blood Culture, Routine : NO GROWTH .
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2132-10-27**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
ECG Study Date of [**2132-10-24**]  5:13:00 PM Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Right bundle-branch block.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
Since the previous tracing of [**2132-10-22**] atrial fibrillation is new with rapid response.
ST-T wave abnormalities are more prominent.
There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema, focal consolidations, or pleural effusions.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Intraventricular conduction delay with QRS duration of 166 milliseconds and a right bundle-branch block pattern.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2132-10-26**] no diagnostic interim change.
No evidence of free air to suggest perforation.
Air and stool are visualized in the colon, and a nonspecific small bowel gas pattern is seen without evidence of obstruction.
Faint amorphous calcifications are seen in the left upper quadrant and may represent an abnormality in the gastric fundus, pancreas, or adrenal gland.
Would recommend abdominal CT for further evaluation if clinically indicated.
ECHO [**2132-10-31**]: There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 77M w hx severe aortic stenosis who presents with COPD exacerbation and hyperglycemia in the setting of preparing to have either valvuloplasty or aortic valve replacement.
# Aortic Stenosis, Critical: Originally scheduled for AVR on [**2132-10-22**] but postponed secondary to COPD exacerbation.
Pt also received ceftriaxone and azithromycin in setting of COPD exacerbation.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Debate was had regarding whether or not pt should go to surgery for valve replacement which would provide a more durable treatment vs valvulplasty which would allow for quicker recovery.
There were no immediate complications and the patient felt well with improvement of his shortness of breath on the day of discharge.
# COPD Exacerbation: Likely community acquired PNA (in hospital <48 hours) with LLL infiltrate on CXR, in addition to a likely component of pulmonary edeam secondary to his chronic diastolic dysfunction.
Repeat CXR showed resolving infiltrate, and by the day of discharge his cough and shortness of breath were markedly improved.
# Coronary Artery Disease: Known moderate diffuse disease including diagonals and OM2; 80% stenosis of the proximal RCA.
His beta blocker was held secondary to low heart rates after starting amiodarone for an episode of atrial fibrillation.
# Paroxsymal atrial fibrillation: The patient had episode of atrial fibrillation/flutter with HR 120-140s.
IV Lopressor was given without much effect, followed by IV diltiazem which slowed his rate and he had spontaneous conversion to sinus.
# Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure possibly [**3-18**] Valvular Disease, hypertension and/or ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Initially had signs of fluid overload and was given IV furosemide IV 40mg once and then continued on his home dose of furosemide 40mg PO daily was resumed.
# Diabetes mellitus: Hyperglycemia in setting of steroid administration for COPD exacerbation.
# Hypertension: Initially his pressures were tenuous and his home BP meds were held, but lisiniopril was restarted and titrated (after valvuloplasty) to home dose 20mg/day with a goal of <120 SBP.
It was clearly communicated to the patient that we recommend taking time off from returning to work in order to recuperate from his COPD exacerbation and avoiding driving to due risk of syncope if his aortic stenosis were to worsen in the future.

Discharge Instructions: You came to the hospital because you were experiencing worsening respiratory symptoms associated with a COPD exacerbation.
Given your known critical aortic valve stenosis, you were admitted for further management of your symptoms in preparation for either valvuloplasty (expanding your heart valve with a balloon) or valve replacement surgery.
