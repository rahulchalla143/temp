Admission Date:  [**2174-12-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2174-12-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2103-11-29**]     Sex:  F  Service:  MICU-Green  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypercarbic respiratory failure.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71 year old female with a history of COPD requiring home oxygen.
EMS were called this morning due to her increased dyspnea.
The patient has been complaining of increasing dyspnea, cough with productive sputum for the last three days with increased frequency of home 02 use.
Also complaining of mild intermittent fevers and chills without nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pain.
At that time EMS was called and they found the patient to be tachycardic at 122 with a blood pressure of 140/40 with an oxygen saturation of 85% on four liters nasal cannula which improved to 100% on 100% nonrebreather.
She was tachycardic and mildly tachypneic with an oxygen saturation of 79% on room air and 99% on 100% nonrebreather.
Thus she was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
History of DVT treated in the past with Coumadin.
Congestive heart failure.
History of pneumonia in [**2174-8-30**].
Transthoracic echocardiogram in [**2173-12-31**] showed ejection fraction of 70% with mild to moderate right ventricular dilation, marked right atrial dilation with a PEA pressure of 70, 2 to 3+ tricuspid regurgitation, 1+ aortic insufficiency and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Mucous membranes are moist, no pharyngeal lesions or exudates.
Neck:  Supple, no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic, regular rhythm, no rubs, gallops or murmurs, no jugular venous distention, no peripheral edema.
Pulmonary:  Lungs clear to auscultation with expiratory wheezes and decreased breath sounds throughout.
Urinalysis showed [**5-9**] white blood cells with occasional bacteria and no epithelial cells.
Chest x-ray showed patchy right middle lobe density.
EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 103 with nonspecific T wave changes in V6.
Per the patient's daughter, she gets very anxious and claustrophobic relatively easily.
On several occasions post-extubation the patient became acutely tachycardic, mildly hypertensive and tachypneic without significant changes in her oxygen saturation or in her arterial blood gas.
She was placed on BiPAP briefly for two of these episodes and was eventually treated with IV Ativan for anxiety.
The patient was also provided with DVT and GI prophylaxis while in the Intensive Care Unit with subcutaneous Heparin and IV Pepcid.
She does not have a prior history of diabetes mellitus.
COPD exacerbation.
History of DVT treated with Coumadin in the past.
Echocardiographic findings consistent with hyperdynamic left ventricular function, mild to moderate right ventricular dilation, marked right atrial dilation, elevated pulmonary arterial pressures, 2 to 3+ tricuspid regurgitation, 1+ aortic insufficiency and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
