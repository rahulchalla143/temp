Given his presenting symptom prior to the arrest was HA and nausea/vomiting this could have been suggestive of an MI, however, pt's cath was clean, and pt did not endorse CP prior to passing out.
Troponin elevation likely from chest compressions gotten at OSH.
# Thrombocytopenia: Plt count dropped from 180 ([**9-19**]) to 77 ([**9-21**]), improved back to 122.
Too soon to be Type II HIT and plt count too low to be Type I HIT.
# Aspiration PNA: Pt with fever and new R-sided opacity on CXR, with hx of beef stew seen in throat, very suggestive of aspiration PNA.
Pt had no fevers while on levo and flagyl.
# HTN: BP mildly elevated.
