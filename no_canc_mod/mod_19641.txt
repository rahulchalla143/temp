In the ICU the patient spiked a temperature to 102 and he was given Rocephin and Clindamycin for suspected aspiration pneumonia.
Per patient's wife, he was diagnosed with seizures 1 year ago when he had a seizure at home and presented to [**Hospital1 2025**].
Found to have CVA which was thought to be cause of seizure.
He has not had a seizure since then but has complained of seeing spots occasionally.

There was diminished compressibility in the left cephalic vein compatible with acute thrombosis.
IMPRESSION: Superficial venous thrombus noted in the cephalic vein.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right or left leg DVT.
Given suspicion for meningitis in the setting of seizure + fevers patient was given one dose of Ceftriaxone 2 gm IV with infectious disease consent required for further treatment.
Also, a history suspicious for Patient was sent for urgent MRA of head & neck and MR of head which showed:  1)No enhancing lesions.
Chronic infarct in left parieto-occipital lesion, and 2)50% narrowing of right proximal ICA.
Left ICA origin atheroma."
Patient was initially seen on unit by Neurology who recommended continuation of Keppra, EEG to evaluate for seizure activity, ECHO for new murmur + fever, LP when INR < 1.5, and an increase in versed drip with consideration of dilantin load if patient seized again.
Suctioning from ETT showed brownish-grey aspirate and UA that day showed no organisms.
HD#2 ([**2131-8-3**]):  Patient received Tylenol for fever overnight and had ECHO and EEG in the morning.
ECHO showed no signs of valvular vegetations and EEG showed no signs of an epileptiform focus.
In the setting of seizure + fevers meningitis remained at the top of our differential diagnosis and an LP was arranged.
Prior to admission patient had taken coumadin for his atrial fibrillation and on transfer to MICU initial INR was 2.5, patient was initially given 3 units of FFP with following INR=1.7.
Transfusion of two more units of FFP resulted in no change in INR so plan for LP was aborted.
During the day patient became very anxious, became tachycardic to the 140s, began demonstrating tremor in his lower extremities bilaterally and started pulling against his restraints.
He was also bolused with Dilantin 1000 mg IV once since patient was also displaying tremor in LE bilaterally while sedated.
Patient remained tachycardic to the 120s-130s depsite the increase in sedation and diltiazem 60 mg PO QID was started with diltiazem 5 mg IV for immediate control.
To empirically cover aspiration pneumonia Vancomycin & Flagyl were started and ID approval for Ceftriaxone therapy (to cover pneumococcus) was obtained.
Ampicillin was also started to cover Listeria monocytogenes and acyclovir was started due to concern for HSV encephalitis after blood drawn for HSV PCR.
HD#3 ([**2131-8-4**]):  Patient remained febrile and began having episodes of loose stools.
Patient with long history of ulcerative colitis, but stool sample sent for C.diff toxin which was negative.
Two fluid boluses of 500 cc were given with no effect.
CT of chest with contrast showed:  1)bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis & consolidation, left>right, 2)2 small pulmonary nodules in RUL ~4 cm in diameter, 3)airspace disease in the LUL, and 4)coronary artery and mitral annulus calcifications.
Also continued to have loose stools with output of 2L, flagyl discontinued due to multiple negative C.diff toxin screens.
However, stool was re-sent for C.diff A&B toxins and banana flakes were added to tube feeds to bulk-up stools.
Patient continued to have episodes of anxiety throughout the day for which he was given Lorazepam 1 mg IV for breakthrough relief.
PICC line was place in right arm in the a.m.  Zosyn 4.5 mg IV Q8H was started to empirically cover G(-) organisms causing pneumonia .
HD#6 ([**2131-8-7**]):  No high fever spikes, but patient ran low-grade fever of 100.5.
Azithromycin 500 mg PO BID added to cover atypical causes of PNA (mycoplasma/chlamydia/etc).
Heparin ggt restarted for DVT prophylaxis.
Overnight, patient became agitated on CPAP+PS, AC restarted briefly for a few hours and placed back on pressure support.
Dosed again with Lasix 40 mg IV to removed fluid that had third spaced into tissues/pleural space.
Patient also became tachycardic with HR increase to 130s-140s, diltiazem drip increased to 10 mg/hr.
Began having apneic episodes on pressure support and was placed back on AC at 20:00.
Tube feeds held due to continued high gastric residuals.
Urine sent for urine lytes (Na, BUN, creatinine), urine eosinophils, microscopic analysis.
Likely due to hypovolemia secondary to diuresis.
Throacic ultrasound performed to look for possible empyema/loculated plueral effusions and did not reveal any significant fluid collection that would benefit from throacentesis.
Decided to give patient spontaneous breathing trial.
Patient maintained own ventilation for 30 min at which time respirations were ~40/min, SaO2 92% and patient having difficulty breathing.
Recommended checking Borellia and Ehrlichia serologies and inspecting peripheral smear of blood for parasites (babesiosis) if spiked temp again.
HD#9 ([**2131-8-10**]):  Renal consulted for decline in renal fxn and proposed ATN vs. prerenal azotemia vs.
Renal US showed no evidency of hydronephrosis.
Had CT of head/sinuses which showed no acute sinusitis with mild mucosal thickening and non-contrast CT of chest & abdomen which showed: 1.
Bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis and consolidation, greater on the left than the right.
Stable extensive coronary artery and aortic calcifications.
No discrete focus of infection is identified although this study is limited by lack of contrast.
ID recommended further checking CMV serologies, patient spiked temp to 101 and blood was cultured again for anaerobic bacteria and fungus.
Attempted to wean esmolol gtt, could not maintain adequate control of HR & BP.
Patient then started on diltiazem 30 mg PO QID in addition to metoprolol 75 mg PO TID to control rate, though patient continued to be tachycardic and HTNive throughout day.
Overnight patient remained confused, likely residual effect of multiple heavy sedatives, and attempted to climb out of bed and required one-time doses of ativan & zyprexa.
Patient had TEE which showed no vegetations and severely deformed aortic valve.
D/C'd doxycycline per ID recs and had repeat CXR due to increased airway secretions and concern over ?aspiration while taking a.m. medications.
Order placed for speech & swallow eval, post-poned until tomorrow due to patient having brief episode of tachypnea and sats down to 92% requiring non-rebreating mask.
Per nursing that morning, patient had questionable episode of aspiration while taking morning medications.
Repeat CXR showed marginal worsening infiltrates in the RML.
He had several hours of respiratory stability but eventually re-developed tachypnea (50) and hypoxemia (7.48/36/61 on NRB) followed by an episode of hypotension and was re-intubated.
Initially struggling against ventilator requiring increases in sedation, suctioning of ETT showing brownish-[**Doctor Last Name 352**] sputum.
Now weaning sedation with vent on CPAP+PS as patient tolerates, decreased sputum production.
Pt extubated [**8-11**], required supplemental O2 via NC and HiFlow NRB over following days & developed tachypnea and hypoxia early morning of [**8-15**] requiring re-intubation.
[**8-15**] LENI and L UENI show no DVT, CT chest same day showing new bilat LL consolidation concerning for aspiration, bridging small-to-moderate pleural effusions and new hydrostatic pulmonary edema.
NGT placed prior to extubation for tube feedings due to recent h/o aspiration.
-aspriation PNA most likely culprit, cont IV vanc/zosyn renal dosing.
Currently on day 13/14 of zosyn regimen, will extend until chest can be re-imaged and abscess confirmed/ruled-out.
2)Fevers: Patient presents with fevers since he was admitted to OSH.
Likely cause of new onset seizures.
Possible sources of infection include LLL infiltrate.
No report of productive cough, dysuria, other symptoms at home.
Lack of leukocytosis may be due to UC tx with 6-MP.
[**8-11**] Non-contrast CT of head/chest/abdomen for eval of possible sinusitis and surveillance of occult focus of infection =>no infectious source.
[**2131-8-13**] TEE shows not evidence of endocarditis and a severely deformed aortic valve.
- Tylenol PRN for fever - Continue broad coverage of PNA.
Likely due to hypovolemia/prerenal azotemia secondary to lasix diuresis.
Urine lytes show no eosinophiluria, FENa and FEuria indicate intrinsic renal etiology of [**Last Name (un) **].
Morning of [**8-15**] found to be 155 but patient sedated after reintubation and difficult to assess for mental status changes.
5)Atrial fibrillation: Patient remains in atrial fibrillation; confirmed by EKG on admission to OSH and [**Hospital1 18**].
- [**2131-8-9**] shows severe AS with valve diameter of 0.8 cm2.
6)Seizure disorder (requiring intubation): Patient was diagnosed with seizure disorder 1 year ago in setting of CVA.
Now presents with recurrent seizures despite being on Keppra.
Concerned about meningitis as a possible etiology though ruled out by negative LP.
[**2131-8-3**] MRA head/neck and MR of head show no new enhancing lesions.
Same day ECHO for new murmur showed no vegetations and EEG showed no epileptiform focus.
- Infectious etiology continues to be at top of differential, but pneumonia only foci identified thus far.
- IV ativan if patient becomes symptomatic for seizures .
Per wife, patient has history of cramping and loose stools on a regular basis.
- Banana flakes added to tube feeds if having loose stools.
8)CAD s/p CABG: No complaint of recent SOB or chest pain during this admission.
- Continuing home statin, on oral beta blocker and CCB for rate & pressure control.
