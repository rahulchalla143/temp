Admission Date:  [**2196-1-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2196-1-29**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Levofloxacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status due to sepsis secondary to urinary tract infection.
History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] year old WF with a history of hypertension and sepsis [**2-2**] urinary tract infection, who originally presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with altered mental status, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2196-1-10**] for further management of sepsis [**2-2**] urinary tract infection.
Was originally transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] due to persistent hypotension and bradycardia in the setting of positive urine analysis.
MICU team attributed bradycardia to hyperkalemia on presentation and poor atenolol excretion [**2-2**] acute kidney injury.
Of note, she had a positive UA on presentation here, though cultures from [**Hospital1 **] and here have remained negative (here she had corynebacterium in one culture which was likely a contaminant).
Her MICU course has been complicated by new atrial fibrillation with RVR, for which she was initially given dilt IV and dilt PO without improvement in her rate (100s-110s).
She was started on an amiodarone load approx 36 hours after atrial fib onset and converted to sinus rhythm 6 hours later.
Due to development of pedal edema and findings of mild interstitial edema on chest xray, patient was started on lasix gtt for volume removal which was transitioned to lasix IV boluses with goal removal of negative 1L daily.
Hospital course also complicated by development of diarrhea with positive c. diff stool culture.
Over the weekend, her diet was advanced by MICU team without difficulty.
On the floor, patient reports that she feels fine, denies any complaints and wants to go home as soon as possible.
Reports that she had [**2-3**] loose stools overnight.
Past Medical History: Hypertension History of urosepsis  Social History: She lives at home with her sister.
No rales appreciated.
HEART: RRR with nl S1-S2, no m/r/g.
EXT: 2+ pitting edema appreciated int he bilat ankles and feet.
>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.. .
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2196-1-13**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
Urine Culture [**2196-1-12**]:  No growth.
FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
Compared to the previous tracing there is no significant change.
Cardiomegaly with mild interstitial edema.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.
Moderately dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasound [**2196-1-15**]:  IMPRESSION: 1.
No lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with marked tortuosity of the aorta and there are moderate pleural effusions bilaterally and mild basilar atelectatic change.
Minimal fullness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
No evidence of nephrolithiasis.
Bilateral hydroureter with shaggy appearance of the ureteral lining without a focal point of narrowing to suggest obstruction that is most likely related to ascending infection from known urosepsis.
Subtle hypodensity seen projecting over the left renal vein of uncertain etiology that may be artifactual as the renal vasculature is suboptimally assessed on this non-contrast study, though if thrombosis is of clinical concern, a renal ultrasound can be obtained for evaluation.
Cholelithiasis without secondary signs of cholecystitis.
Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
Bilateral small-to-moderate simple pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
A structure that is likely the left renal vein is identified on the grayscale imaging, though colour analysis was not possible secondary inability to breath-hold.
CXR [**1-25**] Lung volumes are much lower, probably due to atelectasis, and a contribution of small subpulmonic pleural effusions, greater today than on [**1-19**].
Atelectasis is present at the base of the left lung.
Moderate cardiomegaly and a generally very large and tortuous thoracic aorta are longstanding.
Right upper lung shows vascular congestion but pulmonary edema if present, is mild.
No pneumothorax.
Discharge labs: 2.9>32.2<244 PT 40.6, PTT 37.8, INR 4.3 147/3.6/107/32/24/1.6<94 Ca 8.8, Mg 2.4, Phos 3.3   Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old Caucasian female with history of hypertension and urosepsis, admitted to the MICU with sepsis secondary to URI, with hospital course complicated by new atrial fibrillation with RVR in setting of pressors, ARF, pulmonary edema attributed to volume resuscitation, and c. diff colitis.
Sepsis [**2-2**] urinary tract infection.
Patient initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] with altered mental status, found to have a positive UA, hypotension, bradycardia, and was started on vanco/zosyn as well as dopamine for BP support.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2196-1-10**] due to persistent hypotension and bradycardia, and she was intubated for airway protection.
It was felt that her bradycardia was likely due to rention of atenolol in setting of acute kidney injury as well as hyperkalemia.
Initially in the MICU, she was on dopamine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin for BP support.
She had a positive UA on arrival here, though cultures from [**Hospital1 **] and here have remained negative (here she had corynebacterium in one culture which was likely a contaminant).
Her course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of pressors, ARF, pulmonary edema secondary to aggressive volume resuscitation, and C. difficile colitis following a 7 day course of vancomycin and 8 day course of zosyn.
New atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Trigger was likely underlying infections (UTI, C. diff) in the setting of critical illness and multiple vasopressors for blood pressure support.
She maintained sinus rhythm until [**2196-1-22**], when she developed second episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR with rates in the 170s.
Her amiodarone will be continued as an outpatient with plans for pulmonary funciton testing.
Mild pulmonary edema.
Patient was transitioned off pressors, with albumin volume resuscitation but found to develop mild pulmonary edema on chest radiograph.
Echo demonstrated moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension, preserved LV function and cavity size, and a moderately dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle.
She was started initially on lasix gtt for volume removal, and then transitioned to lasix IV bolus with net removal of approximately 1L per day.
Upon reaching the floor, repeat chest radiograph demonstrated mild fullness of pulmonary vessels.
On physical exam, with notable 2+ pedal edema with oxygen requirement.
Due to elevated sodium and creatinine and suspicion that patient was euvolemic upon reaching the floor, further diuresis was discontinued upon reaching the general medicine floor.
Acute renal insufficiency.
While baseline appeared to be approximately 1.0, creatinine was found to be 2.6 on admission, likely due to volume depletion or hypotension in the setting of sepsis.
While sodium was within normal limits upon admission, levels elevated gradually over [**Hospital 12145**] hospital course.
Will need daily sodium checks and should encourage PO free water, and should consider D5W if continues to rise with the addition of lasix due to volume overload.
Following completion of vancomycin and zosyn, patient developed diarrhea and found to have positive stool studies.
Without fever or leukocytosis.
Patient underwent straight catheterization with post void residual >500cc's.
CT abdomen and pelvis was performed and demonstrated bilateral hydroureter with shaggy appearance of the ureteral lining without a focal point of narrowing to suggest obstruction that is most likely related to her infection from known urosepsis.
There was also a question of a subtle hypodensity seen projecting over the left renal vein of uncertain etiology that may be artifactual.
Renal ultrasound was performed but was of poor quality.
Originally presented to the hospital with hyperkalemia which was reversed with calcium, resin binding.
Losses were also likely aggravated by diarrhea and poor PO intake.
Status post extubation, patient was found to have difficulty swallowing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Sepsis secondary to urinary tract infection Atrial fibrillation Clostridium difficile colitis Acute kidney injury Pulmonary edema Hypernatremia Urinary retention   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker or cane)   Discharge Instructions: It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 827**].
You were originally seen at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for altered mental status, and were found to have a urinary tract infection that had spread to your blood.
Your hospital course has been complicated by an irregular heart rhythm that was controlled with medications.
You also developed diarrhea due to an infectious cause and were given medication to help you clear this infection.
You also developed some fluid in your lungs that improved with diuretic medication.
Finally, you have developed some difficulty urinating, and will need a foley in place for several more days (until you see the urologist) to allow your bladder to regain its former shape.
Please seek medical attention should you develop pain with urination, inability to urinate, increased frequency of urination, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, chest pain, worsening diarrhea.
You will need daily sodium checks and should drink free water, and should consider D5W if continues to rise with the addition of lasix due to volume overload.
