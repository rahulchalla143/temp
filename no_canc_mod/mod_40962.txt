Increased frequent of complex partial seizures without secondary regeneralization.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 39 year old right handed man with refractory seizure disorder, status post encephalitis at the age of four, with a reported mental age of a nine year old, who now presents with sudden onset multiple complex partial seizures which consist of his head turning to the left with moments of unresponsiveness lasting between ten seconds to thirty seconds.
He was at his baseline until the day prior to arrival on [**2178-12-5**], when he developed a new type of complex partial seizure which as mentioned above consists of left head turn and eye deviation and left arm deviation from time to time approximately ten seconds occurring every five minutes.
Complex partial seizures with secondary regeneralization since four years of age from presumed encephalitis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On general physical examination on admission, he was slightly confused but alert and oriented.
He had nystagmus from left to right and mild left pronator drift.
Decreased deep tendon reflexes in the left upper extremity, bilateral dysmetria and clumsiness.
His course was complicated by continued partial complex seizures as noted above with left side deviation and unresponsiveness and, on [**2178-12-6**], he was transferred to Surgical Intensive Care Unit for closer monitoring, as he was having one episode on the average of five minutes even after receiving 5 mg of Ativan.
He was transferred today from the unit without having had any episodes since [**87**]:00 p.m. last night.
We will get a Dilantin level tomorrow morning as well as trough Phenobarbital level.
