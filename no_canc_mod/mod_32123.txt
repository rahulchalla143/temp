He said "gee, you'd think I'd feel better after a good night's sleep," and she assumed he was having incisional pain.
Then all of the sudden his eyes rolled back in his head and he became unresponsive.
When he arrived here the ED found that he was unresponsive and that his pupils were fixed at 6 mm.
A Head CT was performed, which was negative for any evidence of hemorrhage, and we were consulted.

Color-flow imaging of the interatrial septum raises the suspicion of an atrial septal defect, but this could not be confirmed on the basis of this study.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of intracardiac thrombus.
There is a dynamic interatrial septum, although a septal defect was not well visualized.
MRI Brain: Extensive bilateral PCA infarctions as well as left cerebellar acute infarcts.
Findings consistent with a basilar tip thrombus.
Atherosclerotic calcifications most prominent at bilateral carotid artery bifurcations.
The occlusion of the top of the basilar artery was visualized and IA tPA was given in attempt to dissolve the clot.
MERCI was also attempted and part of the thrombus was removed, however there was residual occlusion of the L PCA.
Shortly after admission, he began to have intermittent afib.
Anticoagulation was not an option given his recent CABG.
Therefore a TEE was done the following day which showed no thrombus.
It showed extensive infarction of bilateral PCA distributions.
This gradually tended down and his ECG showed no dynamic changes.
It remained stable and iron studies were consistent with chronic disease.
On admission, a CXR was done which showed a retrocardiac opacification.
This was treated for 7 days but he still had a LLL infiltrate and fevers intermittently.
He did not have further episodes of afib and was not anticoagulated.
He became afebrile with improvement in his WBC.
Pt remained afebrile with normal WBC for >72hrs prior to discharge.
