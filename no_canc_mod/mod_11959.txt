Admission Date:  [**2159-11-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-11-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-4-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**] Chief Complaint: Cough and Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis   History of Present Illness: 52 yo F with PMH significant for asthma, HTN, presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-23**] after experiencing three days of SOB and cough productive of white sputum.
Pt also noted a gradual onset then worsening of CP over the past three days.
Pt attributed her symptoms to an exacerbation of her asthma.
In addition, pt had three episodes of nonbloody emesis last night.
She also received 30 mg of IV toradol with a decrease in her pain from [**9-10**] to [**1-11**].
A CTA was obtained and this was significant for a moderate to large pericardial effusion measuring [**3-11**] [**Doctor Last Name **].
An echo was then obtained which was significant for a LVEF of >55%; moderate sized pericardial effusion; and sustained right atrial collapse consistent with low filling pressures or early tamponade.
Asthma 2.
Thyroid nodule 3.
Hypercholesterolemia 4.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus- diet controlled 5.
HTN  Social History: The pt is currently separated from her husband.
No ETOH, tobacco, or drugs.
Family History: [**Name (NI) 1094**] sister had MI at age 39 and has DM.
No lesions in the oropharynx.
Pertinent Results: ECG- Sinus tachycardia at 116 beats per minute.
Borderline low voltage.
No ST-T wave abnormalities .
Low lung volumes but the lungs are clear.
Mild blunting of the left costophrennic angle consistent with a small effusion.
No pneumothorax.
CTA ([**11-23**])- No evidence of a PE.
Moderate to large amount of pericardial effusion measuring [**3-11**] [**Doctor Last Name **] on non contrast CT scan without definite evidence of enhancement.
Note is made of small bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis.
Moderate pericardial effusion.
Sustained RA diastolic collapse consistent with low filling pressures or early tamponade.
There is abnormal septal motion suggestive of  pericardial constriction.
There is a small residual pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2159-11-28**], there has been no significant change.
1 Pericardial effusion-Admission TTE showed moderate sized pericardial effusion with RA invagination concerning for tamponade.
This was continued for 3days with no improvement.
Repeat TTE showed enlarging effusion with continued early tamponade so she was taken to the cath lab for percardiocentesis and pericardial drain placement.
She was monitored overnight in the CCU with only 20cc of drain output after pericardiocentesis so drain was pulled the next morning after repeat TTE showed no recurrence of effusion.
On HD2 she manifested signs of URI with rhinorrhea and nonproductive cough with low grade fever which was though to be the cause of her effusion.
She also had bilateral pulmonary effusions thought to be due to tamponade physiology but should be followed as an outpt as they were asymptomatic.
Anemia- Fe studies suggested some component of AOCD but also an inflammatory process with increasing ferritin.
She was guiac neg but this does not rule out GI malignancy.
Pt was not reticking appropirately suggesting production problem which may just be related to recent viral illness.
SPEP and UPEP were negative, hemolysis labs were negative and hematuria was not enought to account fot this level of anemia.
Asthma- We continued to treat atrovent nebs only due to tachycardia but reverted back to her outpatient regimen on discharge.
Wheeze and shortness of breath were minimal during her hospitalization.
[**Name (NI) 12329**] Pt had a history of HTN but was not on any antihypertensives as an outpatient but we did not initiate any antihypertensive therapy given the pericardial effusion and risk of hypotension.
