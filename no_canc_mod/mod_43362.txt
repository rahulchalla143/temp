Upon his return on Sunday (2d PTA), he noted increased pain in his R foot, with swelling and some redness.
The VNA felt that the patient was SOB, tachypneic, tachycardic, and had swollen and painful legs bilaterally.
CT scan of abdomen was obtained and was negative for intraabdominal pathology.
He again had copious amounts of liquid green stool after receiving the Baracat for the CT scan.

A second linear density is also seen in the plantar soft tissues adjacent to the third metatarsal shaft, consistent with an additional foreign body.
Vascular soft tissue calcification is again noted.
