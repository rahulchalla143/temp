M with hypertension, prostate cancer s/p XRT 3 years ago, s/p L percutaneous nephrostomy for hydronephrosis secondary to retroperitoneal fibrosis, who presents with R flank pain, nausea, vomiting, and acute renal failure.
From [**6-9**] - [**2133-6-17**], the patient was admitted with hematuria on the medicine service.
He presented passing large clots of blood in his urine with intermittent hematuria since Novemver [**2132**].
Hematuria was thought to be due to renal stones.
He developed worsening of his L flank pain and presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
CT showed B/L renal enlargement with perinephric stranding and hydronephrosis without obstructing stone.
Cr trended downward after Foley placed, but then increased likely due to obstruction; thus L percutaneous nephrostomy tube was placed on [**2133-6-12**].
His hydronephrosis was thought to be obstructive in nature, likely chronic due to RP fibrosis.
For his pyelonephritis, he was treated with cipro for pan-sensitive e.coli x 10 days.
The patient presented on day of admission due to increasing R flank pain, nausea/vomiting, and weakness.
His malaise and weakness started 3 days ago.
He has been checking for fevers at home and his highest temperature was 98.0.
Since yesterday overnightat 10 PM, he had chills, nausea, vomiting (2-3 times) with decreased po intake.
He also found it difficult to start his urine stream yesterday.
Denies dysuria or hematuria.
His R sided flank pain is [**9-17**] and sharp.
Using a heating pad and taking a percocet helped with the pain somewhat.
His L sided flank pain is a [**2134-4-12**] but has been chronic for last 3 months.
These symptoms are the same as his symptoms when he was previously hospitalized.

R draining slightly pink but clear urine.
L draining clear yellow urine.
Increased perinephric and periureteral stranding on the right with mild hydronephrosis and hydroureter.
Stranding likely due to progression of known retroperitoneal fibrosis but underlying infection cannot be excluded.
No renal or ureteral calculi identified.
Status post nephrostomy on the left with decompression and no residual hydronephrosis.
Hiatal hernia and esophageal wall thickening raises concern for esophagitis.
RENAL ULTRASOUND [**7-4**]:  no evidence of abscess   Brief Hospital Course: 1.
Hypotension/Sepsis due to E Coli bacteremia  Patient had hypotension, bandemia, fever 101.1, and urinalysis suggestive of urinary tract infection.
His blood and urine cultures grew pansensitive E. coli.
Hydronephrosis  Likely secondary to retroperitoneal fibrosis resulting from XRT for prostate cancer.
The right tube was functioning, but was found to have an extra subcutaneous loop which may have been causing the patient discomfort.
Acute renal failure  Secondary to upper GU obstruction.
Hypertension  Antihypertensives were held for hypotension.
Anemia  Baseline HCT is mid-high 20s and he came in dehydrated.
Anemia was felt to be secondary to chronic kidney disease.
There was no evidence of acute bleeding.Iron studies from early [**Month (only) **] were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes - Held oral hypoglycemics while in house and patient placed on insulin sliding scale.
Hyperlipidemia - Statin continued.
Asthma - Albuterol and ipratroprium continued.
Chronic low back pain - Secondary to disc herniation.
GERD - Secondary to hiatal hernia, esophageal thickening on CT.
2 lung nodules in left base stable on repeat CT.
Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain for 7 days.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 Puffs Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for SOB/wheezing.

You had a tube in your left kidney from your last hospitalization and one was placed into your right kidney during this hospitalization.
Please return to the hospital if you experience fevers, chills, uncontrolled pain, dizziness or lightheadedness, shortness of breath, if you see blood draining from your nephrostomy tubes or for any other concern.
