History of Present Illness: 78 M with CAD, CABG x 2, AVR/MVR,HTN, hypercholesterolemia, who was USOH until Friday night when he went up stairs to bed and suddenly became diaphoretic and short of breath.
Continued until he sat down and the chest pain lasted minutes.
He told his wife he had chest pain all night which radiated to his arm.
Since Sat am, he has had chest pain with exertion, took another NTG today.
No palps, N/V/no PND, no orthopnea.
Pt states he had many episodes of diaphoresis, his angina begins with bilaterally terrible wrist pain.
Pt states he notes some blood on the toilet paper, but no clots or fresh blood.
He denies itching, pain in his anus.
Notes that diaphoresis as a harbinger of his atrial fibrillation.
He did have dizziness Sat., some chills now.
Noted to be ill appearing, uncomfortable, [**Month (only) **] BS at bases, [**3-14**] SM, guiac ++ with red clots.
EKG in ED showed NSR at 87 bpm, left axis, nl PR/QRS, LVH old TWI in avL, I, ST elevations in V1/V2 (new), III, avF (?change from baseline).
He was taken to cardiac catheterization from the ED for persistent chest pain on a nitroglycerin drip.
Cardiac catheterization revealed a right-dominant ciculation, LMCA with severe diffuse disease, proximal LCx occlusion, RCA occluded proximally, SVG-RCA with an ostial 99% lesion and SVG-OM1 proximal 80% and distal 90%.
The patient was noted to have elevated pressures (PCWP 16, RA 11, PA 43/26) and was transferred to CCU for hemodynamic support as he was briefly on a Dobutamine drip after the right heart catheterization.

The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global hypokinesis.
The apex is mildly aneurysmal and dyskinetic.
Left atrial abnormality.
Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left anterior fascicular block.
These findings are consistent with anterolateral ischemia.
No diagnostic interim change.
Moderate reduced ventricular function.
Colonoscopy: Findings: Flat Lesions Multiple angioectasias due to previous radiation therapy were seen up to 10 cm into the rectum.
These findings are consistent with radiation proctitis.
An Argon-Plasma Coagulator was applied for hemostasis successfully.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 103271**] is a 78 male with CAD, CABG x 2, AVR/MVR,HTN, Hypercholesterolemia, who presents with episode of diaphresis and shortness of breath, with EKG changes and positive cardiac enzymes.
Pt was transferred to the CCU with elevated LVEDP (22) on dobutamine, in the setting of a distal GI bleed.
STEMI s/p Four Drug Eluding Stents:  Pt was diuresed in the CCU and quickly weaned off dobutamine.
Apical akinesis: Pt needs long-term anticoagulation from a cardiology perspective to prevent ventricular thrombus and subsequent stroke.
However, pt had lower GI bleeding when placed on heparin and coumadin and therefore did not tolerate anti-coagulation at this time.
?Anxiety/Depression: Pt was given olanzapine as needed for anxiety.
CHF with EF < 20% 3.
Apical Akinesis 4.
Paroxismal Atrial Fibrillation 6.
Type II Diabetes   Discharge Condition: Pt was in fair to good condition, with stable vital signs, no chest pain, stable hematocrit in the low 30's, no BRBPR.
Call your doctor or return to the hospital if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, bleeding from your rectum, weakness, pale skin.
