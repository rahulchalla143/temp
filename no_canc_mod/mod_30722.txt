Admission Date:  [**2121-7-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-8-3**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Sulfonamides / Nsaids / Codeine / Percocet  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status, fever  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Central Venous Line Removal  History of Present Illness: (History obtained from charts, son, and telephone discussion with transferring physician).
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 82-year-old woman with MMP including CAD ( s/p 4V CABG [**6-/2112**], s/p PCI [**2114**]), CHF EF 25%, PVD who intiially presented to an OSH on [**2121-7-26**] with chest tightness and shortness of breath that began earlier that day.
Patient ruled out with 3 sets cardiac enzymes, no EKG changes, and stress test revealed cardiomyopathy with EF 30%, no reversible defects.
2 nights prior to transfer, patient felt unwell and experienced a low-grade fever, chills with T 99.5.
Patient with recent history of urinary retention with recurrent UTIs, had been on Macrobid as outpatient which was held on admission, and this was re-started at treatment dose by the covering MD.
Around this time, patient had temperature spike to 103, other VSS (had pulse, BP, and was breathing during unresponsive episode).
Patient had an emergent CT scan which did not reveal bleed, but showed evidence of prior infarctions.
She was admitted to the ICU, where she was found to have labored breathing and was intubated.
Patient continued to spike temperatures, but no localizing source of infection could be found - no rashes, no diarrhea, no cough, no sputum, LP negative.
CAD s/p 4V CABG [**2111**] s/p PCI [**2114**] 2.
No recent travel, no pets.
metastatic rectal CA.
Patellar reflexes asymmetric L > R, hyperreflexive.
Extensive acute innumerable infarcts involving bilateral cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres and a single focus of acute infarct in the right side of the pons.
This could most likely represent embolic or septic in origin and needs clinical correlation.
This could most likely represent thromboembolic occlusion.
Tiny foci of susceptibility, scattered in the brain parenchyma could represent foci of hemorrhage versus calcification.
EEG: Abnormal portable EEG due to the voltage asymmetry and background slowing and disorganization described above.
The lower voltage background over the left hemisphere suggests material interposed between the recording electrodes and cortical surface (e.g.
subdural fluid), or a widespread cortical dysfunction.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
There were no epileptiform features.
ECHO: No vegetations or abscess seen.
Dilated left ventricle with severe regional systolic dysfunction.
Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Moderate aortic regurgitation.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname 1258**] [**Known lastname **] is an 82-year-old woman with CAD s/p 4V CABG, CHF (EF 25%), PVD, who was intubated at OSH for respiratory distress, transferred here for further work-up and management of persistent mental status changes and fever.
# AMS Patient with new acute decompensation in mental status, arrived in comatose state without need for sedation.
Head CT negative for acute changes at OSH.
Given concern for central process, emergent head MRI was obtained which showed large MCA stroke with several small bilateral acute CVAs, likely embolic.
Patient was not anti-coagulated given risk for hemorrhagic conversion.
To evaluate etiology of embolic CVA, LENIs were done and returned negative for DVT.
TTE was done which showed no vegetations or abscess.
Given depressed LOC, EEG was done to rule out non-convulsive status, which showed widespread encephalopathy.
# RESPIRATORY DISTRESS Patient with altered level of consciousness requiring mechanical ventilation, unable to generate spontaneous breaths.
CXR unremarkable for infiltrate or effusion on admission.
# FEVER Patient received full fever work-up including CXR, UA, Blood Cx.
Patient with leukocytosis and left shift.
TTE was obtained to assess for endocarditis, and no vegetations were seen.
# CARDIAC/NSTEMI Patient with significant cardiac history, CAD and ischemic cardiomyopathy, reduced EF 25%.
Patient began to rule in for MI at OSH, enzymes and EKG revealed NSTEMI here.
Anti-coagulation was contra-indicated given large territory infarct.
BB were held to maintain MAP > 60 for cerebral perfusion.
