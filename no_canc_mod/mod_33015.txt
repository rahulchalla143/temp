#RADIOLOGY: []CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2118-8-20**] 11:50 AM IMPRESSION:  When compared to prior study, [**8-10**], there has been interval increase in pleural effusions, mainly on the left.
Brief Hospital Course: []BRIEF CLINICAL COURSE: 70 year old male with CAD s/p CABG (SVG-OM, LIMA-LAD) in [**2093**] and multiple subsequent NSTEMIs and PCIs (most recently a BMS to SVG-OM [**2118-3-31**]), CHF (EF 40-45%), HTN, HLD, paroxysmal Afib (not on coumadin), DM, COPD, OSA, prior CVA, and recent significant GIB ([**4-/2118**]), recently admitted in early [**Month (only) **] s/p fall with c6 fracture and surgical repair, c/f NSTEMI, now with 5 second pause on tele at rehab post d/c, admitted for possible pacemaker placement.
# Sinus Arrythmia: Patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] to [**Hospital **] rehab.
At rehab on [**2118-8-17**], the patient had a 5 second pause on telemetry that coincided with a syncopal event.
No pauses were seen on tele there.
According to EP, there was no indication for pacemaker placement if the patient's symptoms were related to taking too high a dose of metoprolol.
# Acute on chronic CHF (EF 40-45%): Patient is clinically volume overloaded.
Patient also has pleural effusions.
# NSTEMI: Multiple document NSTEMI's in past, most recently on [**2118-8-5**] s/p C6-T1 laminectomy on [**2118-8-4**].
# Cervical spine drainage: The patient presented with posterior neck surgical site drainage, c/f ongoing dehiscence, seen by ortho spine.
[]TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -patient will likely require home O2 for symptomatic control of dyspnea -patient will need to have his posterior cervical neck surgical site monitored for continued wound dehiscence.
