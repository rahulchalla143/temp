She stated that prior to her fall she was in her USOH without any change in her baseline respiratory status or other new symptoms.
There was no head trauma or LOC by report.
Here, spine films revealed no acute fracture.
She was being treated with PT and pain control.
She was not receiving any opiates due to underlying lung disease.
Yesterday evening, the patient triggered after an episode of nausea and vomiting as well as a drop in her O2 saturation.
No CXR or ABG was performed.
CXR performed on floor, showed some diffuse fluffiness.
She continues to have intermittent nausea and vomiting with 2-3 episodes of emesis since yesterday evening.
n the MICU, she was intubated on [**12-12**] for worsening hypercarbia.
That evening she spiked a fever, went into AF vs MAT with HRs into the 160s, and hypotension to the 80s.
She was also started on empiric vancomycin and zosyn for possible aspiration pna.
Her amiodarone was discontinued given concern for worsening lung and liver disease.
O2 requirement the same at 90s n 3LNC and no significant change in RR.
She received lopressor 5 mg IV x 2 without significant change in her HR and decrease in SBP to 80s.

Developed acute respiratry distress and transferred back to MICU.
Completed course of abx for HAP/aspiration PNA, but restarted based on evolving CXR.
Eventually in setting of renal failure pt developed worsening resp status and was placed on CPAP.
When pt became obtunded discussion with HCp - pt's daughter it was decided to not intubate and pt passed away from respiratory failure .
# Tachycardic arrhythmia: Pt had sinus tachycardia to SVT on [**12-13**] ?
# S/P Fall/Pain control: no evidence of fracture.
C/o back pain initially but pain issues were resolved on second transfer back to ICU.
# PTLD: No known active issues during hospitalization.
# HTN: On toprol as inpt.
# Access: PICC line was placed during hospitalization for abx therapy.
# FEN: After aspiration episode, eval'd by speech and swallow.
Made NPO when transferred back to ICU b/c of respiratory distress and concern for aspiration.
# Pt passed away from respiratory distress after she was dependent on non invasive ventilation, then became obtunded and would have required intubation.
