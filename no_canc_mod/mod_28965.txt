Infant began to have increased work of breathing in delivery room requiring facial [**Hospital 43216**] transferred to NICU  Upon admission to NICU, infant was intubated with a 3.0 ET tube with initial vent settings of pressure 22/6, SIO2 of 50% with a rate of 25%.

PDA closed on own without treatment with followup echo on day of life 8 revealed no PDA, PFO but right ventricular systolic pressure increased probably secondary to increased pulmonary pressures.
Oxygen sats were kept > 94 % and by day of life 22 when pulmonary pressures would have dropped, his sats were maintained in normal range of 90-94% This he was able to do in room air.
Infant also had self-resolving SVT with heart rates in the 290s during his first 3 days of life.
