CT perfusion study suggests acute infarctions in the superior right middle cerebral artery territory and in the right posterior cerebral artery territory.
These are not yet detectible on the conventional CT images, with only a small focus of mild cytotoxic edema noted in the right anterior insula.
Large thrombus extending from the distal right common carotid artery into the proximal right internal carotid artery with 99% stenosis.
This thrombus also extends into and completely occludes the proximal right external carotid artery, which demonstrates distal reconstitution, most likely via retrograde filling through its branches.
Bilateral fetal configuration of posterior cerebral arteries.
Enlarged and multinodular thyroid.
Large acute infarctions involving the right frontal lobe, insula, and temporal lobe in the middle cerebral artery territory and the right occipital lobe in the posterior cerebral artery territory.
Focal hemorrhagic transformation in the posterior right temporal lobe.
Motion-limited MRAs of the head and neck demonstrate no appreciable change from the preceding CTAs of the head and neck.
There is a large thrombus extending from the distal right common carotid into the proximal right internal carotid and external carotid arteries, with 99% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery, better demonstrated on the CTA, and complete occlusion of the proximal external carotid artery (with reconstitution via retrograde filling).
Bilateral fetal posterior cerebral arteries with bilateral patent posterior communicating arteries.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Mild aortic valve stenosis.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Dilated ascending aorta.
CTA neck [**6-18**]:Interval decrease in size of the thrombus in the right common carotid artery extending into both the internal and external branches.
A small amount of thrombus is still present.
Worsening pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 87 y/o with past medical history of AFib off coumadin for pastweek for colonoscopy, HTN,HL,AR, CHF p/w acute onset left sided weakness and found to have left hempiplegia and profound neglect consistent with R MCA syndrome.
The patient had a CTA head and neck here which revealed recanalization of the R MCA with cutoff seen at R M2 superior division and evidence  of thrombus at the R CCA occluding 99%, extending to R ECA and R ICA with recanalization distally.
Endovascular intervention was discussed with the neurointerventional attending as well as stroke attending, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2530**] [**Name (STitle) **] and the decision was made that the risk of attempting recanalization of the R CCA thrombus could potentially outweigh the benefit given the risk of distal embolization with manipulation, and relatively intact blood supply currently to circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
The patient had a MRI head which showed large acute infarctions involving the right frontal lobe, insula, and temporal lobe in the middle cerebral artery territory and the right occipital lobe in the posterior cerebral artery territory as well asa focal hemorrhagic conversion.
The patient was briefly placed on a heparin drip despite this due to concern for the right carotid occlusion.
This was later discontinued when the patient had a headache due to concern for bleed.
CT head was obtained 24hours after tPA and showed no progression of hemorrhagic conversion noted on MRI the previous day.
A repeat CTA of the neck showed decreased thrombus of the right common carotid.
Cardiac: The patient was monitored on telemetry and remained in atrial fibrillation.
On [**6-17**] the patient was cleared to start ground solids and nectar thickened liquids.
Dysphagia screening before any PO intake?
(x) Yes - () No (if LDL >100, Reason Not Given: ) 10.
Discharged on oral anticoagulation for patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter?
left facial droop, L hemineglect, L hemiparesis (antigravity).
localizes to pain on the left arm, withdraws to pain in left leg.
Bibasilar crackles in lungs, improved.
This was thought to be secondary to your atrial fibrillation.
You had a cardiac echocardiogram which demonstrated no cardioembolic source, but did show a patent foremen ovale.
