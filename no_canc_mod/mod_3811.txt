Admission Date:  [**2139-7-5**]       Discharge Date:  [**2139-7-9**]  Date of Birth:   [**2083-10-25**]       Sex:  M  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55-year-old male who was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2139-7-5**], for shortness of breath and with a room air oxygen saturation of 72%.
He had been admitted in [**Month (only) 956**] from [**3-16**] to [**3-26**] with hypoxia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.
Work-up at that time involved bronchoscopy which was negative for PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 14174**] of tissue eventually grew out alpha Streptococcus.
Since that discharge, he has been started on Lasix and Lopressor with cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20612**] on [**4-15**] and [**5-3**]; however, he continued to have increasing lower leg edema.
He had transient orthostatic hypotension because he missed his morning dose of Midodrine.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for end-stage renal disease status post a living-related donor kidney transplant in [**2131-1-9**], diabetes mellitus with significant neuropathy with orthostatic hypotension, nephropathy requiring renal transplant, retinopathy with a history of retinal hemorrhages.
He has obstructive sleep apnea and has been on BIPAP since [**Month (only) 1096**].
His left ankle is significant for Charcot joint, and he has a history of recurrent cellulitis.
He has had multiple skin cancers.
Coronary artery disease by stress test.
Heart:  Regular without gallops.
Distant heart sounds.
No obvious murmur.
Right lower quadrant kidney allograft, nontender.
There was an ulcer of the right foot with irritated skin.
Both ankles were significant for edema to the knees.
The patient had a chest x-ray which showed small bilateral effusions, left greater than right, left lower lobe consolidation versus atelectasis.
His chest x-ray is consistent with left lower lobe process, but the rapid development in resolution of his hypoxemia, as well as his chest x-ray findings, are most consistent with acute pulmonary edema.
Certainly PCP would not be consistent with this clinical picture given that his [**Month (only) 547**] MIBI showed significant partially reversible perfusion defect.
A potential clinical picture would be infection such as pneumonia causing increased myocardial demand resulting in acute diastolic dysfunction and then resulting in congestive heart failure.
Cardiology:  The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction, and it was noted that he had an [**Month (only) 547**] MIBI which showed severe perfusion defect in the apex, moderate perfusion defect in the inferior wall, moderate perfusion defect in the septum, all partially reversible, with an ejection fraction of 47%, and septal hypokinesis.
There were no electrocardiogram changes and no angina.
Cardiac catheterization was considered at that time but was deferred because of worsening renal function.
In addition, the patient was started on an Aspirin a day after discussion with his ophthalmologist about a slight increased risk of retinal hemorrhages.
It was decided that even in this patient with a history of retinal hemorrhages, that in light of his significant coronary artery disease, it would be unwise to not give him Aspirin.
He will likely need admission prior to catheterization for intravenous hydration, given his renal function.
Renal function:  The patient, on the hospital floor, developed worsening creatinine to a peak creatinine of 4.0 on the 29th; however, his urine output continued to be adequate, and he continued to have actually high urine output even after Lasix was discontinued.
The etiology of this renal failure was unclear.
It was felt that overdiuresis could be contributing to the acute renal failure.
Because of his high urine output, which was consistent with an ATN-like picture, the patient was instructed to maintain p.o.
Chest x-ray however showed a retrocardiac opacity which remained even after diuresis; however, the patient was afebrile on the floor.
He was treated however with Levaquin which was renally dosed at 250 q.d., and the patient was continued for a full 14-day course of Levaquin; however, he had no elevation in white count and had no fevers on the Medical floor at all.
Hematology:  The patient had anemia with a hematocrit of 29 post-diuresis.
congestive heart failure symptoms, Lopressor 50 b.i.d., ProAmatine 10 t.i.d., Niferex 150 q.d., NPH 32 and 9 as previously, regular Insulin sliding scale, Levaquin 250 p.o.
Congestive heart failure.
Diabetes mellitus.
End-stage renal failure with transplant and acute renal failure on chronic renal failure.
