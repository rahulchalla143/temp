No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
No nodules or masses.
No pleural effusions.
Tiny right upper pole renal arterial blush at the margin of laceration demonstrates non-enhancement on delayed imaging, suspicious for a renal pseudoaneurysm.
Recommend further evaluation by angiogram.
Status post surgery with liver and splenic lacerations without active extravasation.
Persistent residual bibasilar consolidations.
New left lower lobe widespread centrilobular andperipheral tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, suggestive of aspiration.
Hazy opacity in the right lung suggests either edema or aspiration.
The anterior margin extends through the frontal and temporal bones across the greater [**Doctor First Name 362**] of the sphenoid, through the posterior orbit, and into the ethmoid, without displacement of fracture fragments.
The fracture extends through the root of the medial and lateral pterygoid [**Doctor First Name 362**].
Additionally, there is a fracture through the outer table of the skull extending into the left frontal sinus.
There is lymphadenopathy of the bilateral cervical chains.
There is no intraorbital hematoma.
High-grade tear of the anterior cruciate ligament, including avulsion of the tibial insertion at the tibial spines.
Additional focus of edema and slight depression extends into the medial tibial plateau, consistent with minimally displaced fracture.
High-grade posterolateral corner injury, including avulsion (arcuate) fracture of the fibular head, and probable injury to the fibular collateral ligament, and biceps femoris insertions.
Abnormal signal is seen within the iliotibial band, concerning for injury.
Extensive abnormal signal in the myotendinous junction of the popliteus muscle, worrisome for rupture at the myotendinous junction.
Large bone contusion in the medial femoral condyle.
Small radial tear in the lateral meniscus.
Moderate joint effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Discharge summary started by Surgical resident in Intensive Care Unit:  Patient found to have R PTX in trauma bay after CT (though CXR prior did not reveal this).
And taken emergently to OR for ex lap for hemodynamic instability and free abdominal fluid.
On [**10-28**] he underwent ex-lap, liver packing for laceration.
Reintubated for EtOH w/drawal and inability to clear secretions in setting of need for increased sedation.
No keppra or dilantin required.
He will need to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] 4 weeks for a non-contrast head cat scan.
Cardiovascular: He did sustain a cardiac contusion as a result of the accident.
His initial electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia.
His current electrocardiogram continues to show sinus tachycarida.
Pulmonary:  s/p right pneuomthorax and rib fractures: Right chest tube was discontinued on [**11-1**] with no pneumothorax evident on chest x-ray.
He did sustain bilateral rib fractures.
He denies shortness of breath and is maintaining oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.
GI: s/p exploratory laparotomy and hepatic packing for hemoperitoneum, liver and right renal laceration.
He was taken to the operating room on [**10-29**] for removal of packing and abdominal closure.
He is tolerating a regular diet without complaints of nausea and vomitting.
After this was placed, he developed hematuria for which he required blood transfusion to maintain his hematocrit.
He was taken to IR on  [**11-5**] where he underwent embolization of right lobar artery.
His hematuria has resolved and his bladder irrigations have been discontinued.
He did have his foley changed to a 2-way, but c/o of pain after placment and it was removed.
He does have a brace on his right elbow for ligamentous injury for which he has ROM as tolerated.
His left knee is supported in locked extension in a Blesdoe brace for a high grade anterior cruciate injury for which he will need orthopedic follow-up.
If note increased bleeding after insertion of foley, or clots, please notify the Acute care service  (#[**Telephone/Fax (1) 600**])  Urology has been informed about removal of catheter, inability to void, and transfer to rehab facility.

Discharge Instructions: You are being discharged from the hospital after you sustained injuries from being struck by a car.
You also were found to have blood in your urine for which you required blood transfusions.
You are being discharged with the following instructions:  *  Your injury caused rigth sided rib fractures which can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the pain.
*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths.
If the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and notify your physician.
*  Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.
*  You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and deep breathing.
*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid and fiber intake if possible.
*  Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation around your ribs ( crepitus)  Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you have any of the following:    * You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or  tightness.
* New or worsening cough or wheezing.
* If you are vomiting and cannot keep in fluids or your  medications.
* You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting,  diarrhea or other reasons.
Signs of dehydration include dry  mouth, rapid heartbeat or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.
* You see blood or dark/black material when you vomit or have a  bowel movement.
* You have shaking chills, or a fever greater than 101.5 (F)  degrees or 38(C) degrees.
