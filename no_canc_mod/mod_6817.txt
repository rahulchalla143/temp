HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 37-year-old man with HIV aids, last CD4 count of 22, viral load greater than 750 ......./ml, who is a patient at [**Hospital6 **] and was referred for admission for fevers and anemia.
It was reported that he had been doing poorly times four weeks with complaints of fatigue and intermittent diarrhea since [**Month (only) 1096**].
His temperature waxed and waned with severe night sweats, chills, headache and intermittent photophobia.
The patient also noted watery-brown diarrhea occurring over the past month, as well as nausea and poor p.o.
At that time, he was started on Flagyl empirically for belly pain and diarrhea, but he had to stop after three doses because of an anaphylactic reaction requiring Benadryl and steroids in the Emergency Department on [**2173-1-27**].
The patient presented to his primary care physician's office on the day of admission because of significant temperatures, as well as having hallucinations, "seeing fairies on the edge of his bed," on the morning of admission.
The patient reported poor compliance of his antiretrovirals secondary to intolerance from side affects.
He most recently was on therapy ................ two weeks prior to admission when they were stopped for concerns of side affects versus infection causing the fevers and diarrhea.
Anxiety disorder.
Pancytopenia felt secondary to HIV disease.
Per his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] anemia improved with HAA-RT therapy.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Maternal aunt and uncle who both reported died secondary to intracranial aneurysmal bleeds.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco.
General:  The patient was a pleasant, thin, young man in no acute distress.
No wheezes, rhonchi or rales.
Extremities:  No edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the General Medicine Service for further work-up of his fevers and diarrhea.
Infectious disease:  In the Emergency Room, the patient was evaluated first for acute meningitis with lumbar puncture demonstrating 0-1 white cells, greater than 100,000 red blood cells, no xanthochromia, protein 256, glucose 47, with negative gram stain, no polys.
The patient underwent further work-up for possible source of infection including full-body scan which was negative for abscess and unremarkable for lymphadenopathy.
His chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia.
The patient underwent further evaluation of his abdomen given his diarrhea complaints including full set of stool cultures sent times three which were unremarkable, as well as a colonic biopsy, including testing for CMV which was again unremarkable.
The patient's stool viral culture was notable for a positive adenovirus.
Eventually send-out lab results came back demonstrating a positive urine histologic antigen.
On [**2-19**], the patient commenced treatment for histoplasmosis including ................. 3 mg/kg/day, pretreatment Tylenol, Benadryl, and 500 cc normal saline.
Of note, the patient's stool was determined to be positive for adenovirus, as well as possible nasopharyngeal swab confirming the presence of adenovirus.
Neurologic:  The patient's confusion persisted throughout the first two weeks of hospitalization correlating well with his temperature spikes.
The source of his mental status changes was felt likely to be ................... given his infectious source.
However, he was also evaluated for possible HIV encephalopathy, including a lumbar puncture to test for CSF HIV viral load which demonstrated 6230 ...../ml.
The case was discussed with Dr. ................. who felt that the elevated viral load in CSF would be consistent with HIV encephalopathy.
Heme:  The patient had persistent pancytopenia requiring multiple blood transfusions throughout his hospitalization.
He tolerated these without difficulty and had good symptomatic relief and improvement in his low blood pressure.
The likely source of his pancytopenia is bone marrow involvement from his HIV disease.
