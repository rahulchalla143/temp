Admission Date:  [**2159-6-14**]       Discharge Date: [**2159-6-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2090-2-3**]       Sex:  F  Service:  GYN/ONC with transfer to Medical Intensive Care  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 41323**] is a 69-year-old woman with a history of recently-diagnosed endometrial cancer status post total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, on [**2159-5-8**].
On initial examination by the Gyn Service, the patient was noted to have greenish exudate emanating from an open 3 cm incision.
There was associated mild erythema and minimal tenderness.
Coronary artery disease.
Endometrial cancer, status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
6. aortic stenoisis 7.
Morbid obesity.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to PENICILLIN AND SULFA.
FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's sister has depression and lung disease.
GENERAL:  The patient was an obese-appearing woman in no acute distress.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Examination indicated regular rhythm, normal S1 and S2 and a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur.
The patient had an open 3 cm incision over her left lower abdomen with greenish discharge.
There was mild erythema and minimal tenderness.
EXTREMITIES:  On extremity examination, the patient had trace edema bilaterally with palpable peripheral pulses.
Culture later turned out to be positive for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, as well as rare Enterococcus and Corynebacterium.
and bacteroides fragilis.
Urinalysis indicated 11 white blood cells, occasional bacteria and one subcutaneous epithelial cell.
The patient was also noted to have decreased mental status with impairment in orientation and attention.
The patient was without additional complaints of dyspnea.
She was noted to have diminished breath sounds at the bases and ABG indicated pH of 7.24, pCO2 of 73, pAO2 of 326.
Chest x-ray did not indicate any signs of overt congestive heart failure and there were no effusions.
There were no EKG changes.
The etiology of the patient's hypercarbia was unclear, thought secondary to body habitus versus mucous plugging versus CNS depression.
Oxygen requirement remained stable on four liters nasal cannula.
She was started on nightly BiPAP for possible obstructive sleep apnea.
The following summarizes the patient's initial events while on the Acove Service.
Infectious Disease was consulted with the question of whether the patient might simple be colonized with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or whether she actually had a MRSA wound infection.
Given that the patient's hypercapnia appeared to have resolved, it was decided that her transient hypercapnia might best be worked up as an outpatient in the context of pulmonary evaluation and/or a sleep study.
Her ace-Inhibitor has been stopped since hypotensive episode and ARF.
Could consider readding at later date if BP rises but will need close monitor of renal function.
Would avoid NSAIDs altogether due to renal insufficiency.
It was felt that delirium was multifactorial including hypotension/acute renal failure/infection/?side effect of antibiotics/hypercarbia and hypoxemia.
Wound infection status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
2. aortic stenosis 3.
Coronary artery disease.
Morbid obesity.
Acute renal insufficiency, resolved.Creat 1.1/BUN 19 day prior to discahrge.
Hypercarbia, resolved-likely due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11333**] in [**Name (NI) **] Pt should have pulmonary eval as outpatient including f/u of oxygenation, PFTs and sleep study to eval baseline hypoxemia and possible OSA/obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
