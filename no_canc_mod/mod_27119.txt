Admission Date:  [**2142-10-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-11-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2124-7-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3223**] Chief Complaint: s/p Rollover motor crash  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2142-10-20**] Repair of left hand extensor tendon/STSG   History of Present Illness: 18 yo female unrestrained driver, s/p rollover MVC; ejected from vehicle.
She was intubated at scene secondary to combativeness.
FINDINGS: There is a small left-sided acute subdural hematoma along the anterior left frontal convexity, up to 3 mm in thickness.
There is also a suspected thin subdural along the posterior aspect of the falx cerebri up to 4 mm in diameter.
A punctate 2 mm density in the subcortical white matter, within the right frontal lobe, is suggestive of a hemorrhagic contusion.
Additional punctate densities along the medial periventricular white matter adjacent to the right lateral ventricle, and within the right side of the corpus callosum, are suspicious for diffuse axonal injury with hemorrhage, based on their locations.
There is no mass effect, hydrocephalus or shift of the normally midline structures.
The ventricles, cisterns, and sulci are unremarkable without effacement.
There is a small air-fluid level in the left maxillary sinus which can be seen in intubation.
There is slight mucosal thickening in the sphenoid sinus.
There is bilateral soft tissue swelling above the orbits anteriorly.
Small left frontal subdural hematoma, with suspected small subdural along the posterior falx cerebri as well.
Small right frontal hemorrhagic contusion.
Dense foci along the right lateral ventricle, and within the corpus callosum, suspicious for diffuse axonal injury with hemorrhage.
When clinically appropriate, an MR is suggested in order to better evaluate the extent of injury, as MRI is more sensitive, in particular, for detection diffuse axonal injury, particularly for foci not associated with hemorrhage.
INDICATIONS: 18-year-old woman with altered mental status after motor vehicle accident.
There is no evidence of fracture, dislocation, bony destruction, or prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
The patient is intubated, and there is a nasogastric tube passing through the esophagus.
In the left upper lobe, there is a peripheral 4-mm nodular density which may represent a lung nodule, or perhaps a small contusion, although there is no evidence of surrounding injury to suggest chest injury.
There is mild dependent change in the visualized right apex.
No evidence of fracture or dislocation.
Small density in the left upper lobe, which could represent a small contusion or nodule.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: CP processes  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 18 year old woman with fever REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: CP processes IMPRESSION: 18-year-old with fever, status post motor vehicle accident.
There are no pleural effusions.
No evidence of central lymphadenopathy.
Neurosurgery and Plastic Surgery were consulted because of her injuries.
She was taken to the operating room for repair of her extensor tendon and STSG.
Because of her [**Doctor First Name **] Behavioral Neurology was consulted as patient was having behavior issues; periods of extreme restlessness and agitation.
Because of the dramatic improvement in her mental status it is expected that the Dobhoff will be very short term and she will eventually have her diet upgraded with continued evaluation by SLP once at rehab.
On the morning of her discharge she was in the bathroom and while sitting on the toilet slipped hitting her right foot, on examination there was no point tenderness or swelling.
No other injuries were identified.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: REHAB HOSP OF CAPE AND ISLANDS  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p Rollover motor vehicle crash Degloving injury left hand Small subdural hematoma Diffuse axonal injury   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: No procedures left arm because of the injury that was sustained.
Call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2992**] and inform the office that you will need a repeat head CT scan for this appointment.
