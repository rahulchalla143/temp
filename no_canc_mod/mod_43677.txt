In comparison with the prior examination, the left perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage has been decreased in the interim without evidence of mass effect.
No new intracranial hemorrhages are visualized.
Unchanged scattered foci of low attenuation in the periventricular white matter, likely consistent with microvascular ischemic disease, please correlate.
There is decrease in the size of the right frontal convexity subgaleal hematoma, unchanged right nasal bone fracture as well as fracture of the nasal septum.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST IMPRESSION: No traumatic injury to the cervical spine.
Abnormal EKG.
Normal biventricular cavity size and regional/global systolic function.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Neurosurgery was consulted because of her SAH; this injury was nonoperative; she was loaded with Dilantin and serial head CT scans were performed which were stable.
