Tiny focus of epidural abscess as well as the predominant epidural phlegmon in the cervical spine.
Osteomyelitis in the lumbar spine, predominantly from L1 through L3.
There is abnormal enhancement in the right paraspinal musculature abutting the facet joint from L1 through L5.
There is a left prevertebral/paravertebral abscess at T12-L1.
There is epidural enhancement at L2-L3 on the right, which appears continous with the paraspinal musculature enhancement.
No convincing evidence for epidural abscess in the lumbar spine is seen.
There is also prominent epidural enhancement within the left aspect of the canal at L5-S1.
CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with mild global left ventricular hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic etc.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Marked prevertebral soft tissue swelling with mixed signal intensities.
Post-operative changes and edema can have this appearance.
From an imaging standpoint, it is difficult to rule out residual infection.
Followup MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] of the neck may be helpful to document resolution of these changes.
Small abscess in the right paraspinal musculature, posterior to L3 and L4 as described above.
There are associated inflammatory changes in the muscle, likely representing myositis.
CT of neck [**7-16**]: IMPRESSION: Extensive intercommunicating fluid collections with numerous suspended air bubbles at the surgical site in the neck, deep to the right sternocleidomastoid, as described.
This process extends deep to the strap muscles, communicating with the retropharyngeal and prevertebral spaces, and persistent infected fluid collections cannot be excluded.
There is marked left lateral displacement of the laryngeal skeleton and cervical airway, which remain patent.
Postoperative change in the cervical spine involving C3 through C5.
Persistent signal abnormality at C3 through C5 vertebral bodies and intervening disc is likely related to ongoing inflammation, however, from an imaging standpoint, it is difficult to differentiate between postoperative change and residual infection.
No epidural collection is identified.
Large fluid collection containing gas at the surgical site in the neck extending to the C3 through C5 anterior prevertebral space not significantly changed from the postoperative MRI from [**2104-7-9**], and better evaluated on CT from [**2104-7-16**].

Pt had vancomycin trough in AM which was 5.0, had blood cultures, neurosurgery consult, TTE and had pain medication.
TTE did not show any valvular or abnormal flow suggesting endocarditis.
Patient had surgery on [**7-7**] for abcsess drainage.
Patient was still febrile, and started with a productive cough on [**7-11**].
Due to persistent fever a repeat MRI was obtained as well as more blood cultures.
Repeat MRI showed a small paraspinal abcess in lumbar region (L3-L4).
Neck pain kept increasing, so a CT scan of the neck was done, showing recurrence of the spinal abcsess with a big collection of fluid in the right cervical region.
An MRI ruled out epidural abscess, showed the same osteomyelitis seen in the priro MRI.
He had a drain left in place, which was removed on [**7-21**].
Patient has been afebrile since surgery (max temp 100.4 without tylenol).
Patient had acute renal failure, which was contrast induced after the CT scan.
Patient was explained the severity of his disease in english and spanish and was able to repeat to us.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed for breakthrough pain.
Sodium Chloride 0.9 % 0.9 % Syringe Sig: One (1) ML Injection PRN (as needed) as needed for line flush.
Disp:*25 Syringes* Refills:*3*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Heritage Manor  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary MRSA sepsis with cervical abcsess and cervica osteomyelitis as well drained paraspinal abscess in lumbar spine Gram negative sepsis (not fermenter, not pseudomonas)  Secondary Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus Chronic Renal Failure Stage 3, baseline Cr 2.1 Peripheral Vascular Disease Intravenous drug use (last [**2104-6-29**])   Discharge Condition: Stable, with PICC line in Left arm, breathing normally on room air, comfortable and with pain controlled.
Discharge Instructions: You were sent here from [**Hospital 189**] hospital due to fever, chills and increase WBC before your elective surgery.
You had an MRI later, which showed cervical osteomyelitis (infection of the bone).
Since your fever persisted, as well as positive blood cultures growing S aureus, you had another CT of the neck showing a recurrence in the cervical abscess that was srugically drained again.
You had a PICC line placed in your arm to give you antibiotics for the infection in the bone.
Please stop smoking, since it is very bad for your health and increases your risk for lung diseases and cancer.
If your neck pain persist, you have fever, chills, rigors or anything else that concerns you please come back to the ER.
