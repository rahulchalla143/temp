Central line placement (Left subclavian)   History of Present Illness: 57 yo Male with PMH of hep C/EtOH cirrhosis, history of recurrent hepatic encephalopathy (controlled by lactulose at home), history of seizures in [**2132-2-29**] (thought [**1-2**] narcotic and cocaine withdrawl - further w/u not done) who presents to ED after being sent by his PCP after noted to have some slurred speech/change in mental status, then noted to have bradycardia in ED.
Pt was called by his PCP at home last night to be given some lab results and noted to have some slurred speech on the phone.
As patient has a history of recurrent hepatic encephalitis, was sent to ED by PCP for further [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u.
Pt reports feeling confused and some dizziness earlier in the day.
Also c/o severe thirst.
He was confused, agitated, noted to have slurred speech, + asterixis on exam.
When HR 30, BP 94/56, pt c/o lightheadedness and was given atropine 0.5mg x 1 and Glucagon 5mg IV x 1 (at 16:32), HR increased to 61, BP 112/61.
--Guiac + stool in [**2129**] - s/p colonoscopy that showed incomplete exam due to poor prep.
--EGD in [**2129**] - grade II esophageal varices, hiatal hernia, portal hypertensive gastropathy - started on Nadolol.
--Pancreatitis ([**1-2**] EtOH) --Left foot injury - pins placed - on oxycodone and oxycontin for pain control (Of note, when he stops taking, experiences withdrawl symptoms such as N/V, piloerection, diaphoresis) --HTN --Thrombocytopenia - thought likely [**1-2**] EtOH use, also noted to have hypersplenism.

[**2132-8-21**] CXR: Stable appearance of the chest, with no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Etiology likely hepatic encephalopathy as had asterixis on initial assessment, history of recurrent hepatic encephalopathy in past.
Seizure disorder was also initially entertained, as patient had a history of seizures in [**4-3**], attributed to his oxycodone/oxycontin withdrawl and cocaine and heroin use, but had incomplete follow up (patient failed to show up at scheduled MRI and neurology appointment).
Patient's hepatic encephalopathy resolved, and patient was discharged on home dose of lactulose (30mL TID, titrate to 3 bowel movements/day) with instructions to follow up with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 151**] hepatology, and with pain clinic appointment for further management of his ongoing pain issues (SEE below).
However, when compared to EKG in [**2132-3-30**], shows similar rate and rhythm with ectopic atrial focus.
Initial assessment = ?intrinsic disorder (i.e.
sick sinus syndrome) vs secondary to his nadolol.
Nadolol was held and Atropine and glucogon given in the ED with minimal improvement.
EP was consulted and initially recommended placement of pacemaker, which patient refused at current time and also non-candidate as evidence of recent IVDU.
CCU course notable for improvement of HR from 40's --> 60's, decrease in pauses, without interventions (attributed to Nadolol effect wearing off).
Therefore thought likely bradycardia was secondary to patient's nadolol initiating likely sick sinus syndrome.
Pain control:  Pt with history of significant pain with difficulty controlling.
Hx GI Bleed and known varices and Colon polyp:  Patient was guiac negative on presentation without complaints of melena, maroon stools, or any BRBPR.
Nadolol was held during hospitalization in setting of bradycardia as described above.
No active seizure issues occurred during hospitalization.
Thrombocytopenia: Patient with known thrombocytopenia as outpatient.
FEN: Patient maintained on low protien diet during hospital course, in setting of hepatic encephalopathy.
Hepatic encephalopathy 2.)
Bradycardia - likely sick sinus syndrome   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Patient with improved mentation/somnolence (resolved hepatic encephalopathy) and heart rate improved to 60's, no pauses, asymptomatic.
Please contact physician if develop [**Name9 (PRE) 49205**]/agitation, fever > 100.4, vomit or stool with blood, lightheadedness/dizziness, fainting, weakness, any other questions/concerns 2.)
