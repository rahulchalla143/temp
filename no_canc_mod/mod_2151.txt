He was in his usual state of health until, on [**8-28**] at dialysis, he had a temperature fo 38.
After dialysis he felt awful, consisting mostly of chills and malaise without any change in his chronic nausea or abdomianl pain.
He did not have any pain around the line site.
Surgery was consulted and recommended CT abdomen which showed no evidence of ischemic bowel but did demonstrate a thrombus in the SVC.
On acceptance to the ICU, the patient feels well but does complain of his chronic low back pain, pain at the site of the L EJ catheter, and chronic abdominal pain.
He also denies chest pain, shortness of breath.

NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2116-9-30**] at 12:05:19 PM FINAL Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the pulmonic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
No apparent echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiogram may better assess for valvular vegetations.
Thrombus within the superior vena cava, with organization and peripheral location suggestive of chronic timeframe.
Postoperative change and fluid within the abdomen that is nonspecific with no dilated loops of small or large bowel.
Questionable sigmoid thickening versus underdistension, that is unchanged since [**2116-9-4**].
No abnormal intra-abdominal fluid collections.
Subcutaneous emphysema likely related to post-surgical change.
Extensive multiple bony deformities and fluid collection between the left femoral neck and left acetabulum from known chronic osteomyelitis.
The fluid collection appears increased since CT from [**2116-9-4**].
Subcutaneous emphysema in the right anterior chest wall, likely related to recent instrumentation.
EGD [**2116-10-6**]: Impression: Erythema and congestion in the antrum compatible with mild gastritis Retained fluids in stomach Bilious fluid was seen in the stomach and duodenum.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: The findings do not account for the symptoms Will discuss with team re: small intestinal evaluation for source of bleeding (capsule vs tagged RBC scan vs CT Angiography).
Brief Hospital Course: A 44 year-old man with a history of paraplegia and ESRD with tunnelled HD line presents with fevers and positive blood cultures from HD.
# Staph aureas and proteus bacteremia: Patient with MRSA in his blood at HD and at [**Hospital1 **].
Most likely secondary to HD line, but patient also has multiple wounds, any of which could potentially seed his blood.
Currently none of the wounds have purulent drainage or otherwise appear infected.
His cultures at [**Hospital1 18**] show blood culture positive for Proteus on [**9-29**], catheter tip culture positive for MRSA on [**9-30**], and wound culture positive for MRSA on [**9-30**].
He was on flagyl earlier in the admission which was discontinued on [**10-5**] as there was no clear indication.
Drainage of fluid collection around left acetabulum: Infectious disease was consulted and felt that the pt's collection in his left hip was increased from prior CT and recommended sampling and drainage as this was also another likely source of infection/bacteremia.
Because the pt became unstable, drainage and full washout was delayed initially but aspiration culture showed pseudomonas.
After he was stablized (see GI bleed section below) he went to OR w/ortho on [**10-11**] and is s/p washout and drain placement [**10-11**]).
Site healed well without complication.
At discharge site looked to be healing well with minimal tenderness, no drainage.
His endoscopy showed gastritis but there was concern for possible bleed at anastomosis site.
No further imaging performed.
Acute anemia in house secondary to GI bleed however patient with baseline normocytic anemia.
Iron studies reflective of anemia of chronic disease.
Hemolysis labs negative.
At 3mth plan to reassess need for ongoing anti-coagulation with PCP; risks vs benefits as patient with h/o GI bleed.
# ESRD: Apparently secondary to amyloidosis, on HD since [**09**]/[**2115**].
Renal placed a temporary IJ access for dialysis.
Line without tenderness, erythema at time of discharge.
# Paraplegia: complicated by multiple ulcers and severe constipation.
5. clonazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for anxiety/agitation.
16. sodium chloride 0.65 % Aerosol, Spray Sig: [**11-23**] Sprays Nasal QID (4 times a day) as needed for dry nose.
17. collagenase clostridium hist.

26. senna 8.6 mg Capsule Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
27. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1) PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 2222**] - [**Location (un) 538**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Bacteremia likely related to either a line infection or due to collection in the left hip SVC clot left hip infection + pseudomonas Paraplegia Multiple chronic non-healing ulcers .
Secondary: ESRD on hemodialysis Pneumonia Anemia hypotension GI bleed, unknown source   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because of low blood pressure and fevers at dialysis.
You were found to have a possible infection of your dialysis line and a clot in the blood vessel that was likely infected.
You were also found to have pneumonia, which was treated with antibiotics.
It was also felt that the collection in your left hip had increased in size and might also be another source of infection.
