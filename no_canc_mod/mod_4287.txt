Small mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are present, but they do not meet the CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a background of centrilobular emphysema.
Moderate patchy consolidated opacities are present in the dependent portions of the right upper and lower lobes.
Given the diffuse thickening of the esophagus and fluid within the proximal esophagus, the consolidation may represent aspiration pneumonia.
There is some mild pleural thickening posteriorly on the right.
Minimal atelectasis is present in the dependent portions of the left lower lobe.
Multiple old rib fractures are noted on the right.
No pulmonary embolus detected.
Right upper and lower lobe consolidated opacities suggesting pneumonia.
Thickened esophagus suggesting esophagitis.
Retention of fluid in the proximal esophagus raises suspicion for aspiration in the right lung.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 68yo male who underwent laminectomy and fusion on [**2115-1-16**] who developed respiratory distress from likely aspiration pneumonia.Post surgery, he had to be lying flat and most likely aspirated.
He was also found to have possible dural leak and had to lie flat for more days in ICU.
However, he developed allergic rash and the antibiotic was hence changed to Zosyn.
Sputum culture initially showed gram negative rods and zosyn was continued while waiting for sensitivity.
He was also found to be very sedated with just a tiny touch of morphine.
His mental status improved drastically with discontinuation of morphine and just using tylenol for pain control.
His sputum eventually grew Citrobacter which is sensitive to levofloxacin and he was hence changed to PO levofloxacin.
Of note, his RA medication-Arava was initially held because of the immunosuppresive effect while he was acutely ill.
Patient found to be guiaic positive on this admission.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
Aspiration pneumonia 2. post laminectomy 3. diabetes 4. hypertension   Discharge Condition: stable, ambulating with assistance, no oxygen requirements  Discharge Instructions: Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you have difficulty in breathing, fever, sudden worsening of back pain, sudden worsening of weakness or if there are any concerns at all  Followup Instructions: 1.
