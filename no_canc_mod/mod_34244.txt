Mild congestive failure.
EEG ([**2168-10-30**]): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the slow background suggestive of severe encephalopathy.
There were no lateralized or epileptiform features seen.
Of note is the sinus tachycardia .
CT Head without Contrast: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Cirrhotic-appearing liver, with evidence of portal hypertension.
Splenomegaly and multiple splenic varices are again identified.
Hepatic veins and main hepatic artery appear patent.
Thickened gallbladder wall with small amount of pericholecystic fluid.
This appearance could be consistent with patient's ascites and third spacing of fluid.

# Hepatic Encephalopathy leading to Altered Mental Status and Disposition: Likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, however component may have been UTI leading to sepsis.
Upon transfer from [**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center the patient was unresponsive to voice with roving eye movements.
In the ICU ([**Date range (1) 15491**]), tox screen negative, intubated for airway protection, CT Head without acute intracranial process, LP performed with platelets and FFP.
EEG revealed severe encephalopathy.
Neuro stated her condition was likely a diffuse, toxic-metabolic process in setting of liver failure.
Upon transfer to the floor on [**11-2**] the patient has no complaints and did not recall the events leading up to her admission to the hospital.
Differential includes hypovolemia (versus infectious (though afebrile currently).

# Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 0.7-0.8 per prior labs in OMR.
Likely related to hypovolemia in setting of insensible losses and acute illness, especially since FeUREA showed a pre-renal picture.
# HCV cirrhosis: Continued lactulose/rifaximin for a long history hepatic encephalopathy secondary to medical non-compliacnce.
LFTS otherwise appear to be at baseline with poor albumin (2.1 at OSH).
The patients was kept on PO lactulose and rifaxamin during her hospital course and had no further encephalopathic symptoms on the floor.
# Skin: Diffuse pinpoint, erythematous, raised lesions that have the texture of sand paper were evident on the extremities and back throughout this admission.
