Family History: Sister with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer and thyroid cancer in 50s  Physical Exam: Admission Exam: VS: 98.7 82 136/65 13 98% on RA GA: AOx3, hoarse voice HEENT:  PERRLA.
Extremities: wwp, no edema.
Scope ENT (on admission): Her glottic opening is about 4mm on scope exam without symptoms including stridor or retraction.
CT neck with contrast ([**2105-4-16**]): Retropharyngeal fluid collection spanning from C2/3 to C5/6 with extensive surrounding edema and inflammation of the hypopharynx.
Patent cervical vasculature.
No pathologic mediastinal widening.
Presence of minimal pleural effusions cannot be excluded.
No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.
No pulmonary edema.
Interval slight decrease of the retropharyngeal fluid collection and improved airway patency.
No evidence of Lemierre's disease or new abscess formation.
No evidence of extension of the fluid collection into the mediastinum.
No evidence of mediastinitis.
This could be due to empyema considering clinical suspicion for this entity, but definitive diagnosis would require correlation with thoracentesis results.
Small dependent left pleural effusion has also increased in size since the prior study but does not have loculated components.
Slight increase in size of pre- and sub-carinal lymph nodes as well as right hilar nodes.
Ground-glass opacities in left upper lobe which are likely infectious or inflammatory in etiology.
TTE ([**4-22**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**4-23**] CXR REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Evaluation of the patient with complicated pleural effusion.
There is interval increase in right pleural effusion, loculated, better appreciated on the prior radiograph but the change in size is significant.
No pneumothorax is seen.
Left pleural effusion is unchanged.
Bibasal areas of atelectasis are noted.
BETA-LACTAMASE CONFIRMATION REQUESTED BY DR. [**Last Name (STitle) 2345**].
Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo F with PMHX of HTN presenting with sore throat, neck pain, and odynophagia found to have epiglottis and retrophargyneal phlegmon.
The patient's airway was closely monitored in the ICU and underwent repeat ENT scoping on [**2105-4-18**] that showed ongoing arytenoid edema but completely patent airway.
Repeat CT neck and chest with contrast, in the setting of ongoing posterior neck pain and inspiration pain as well as worsening erythematous lesion (see below), did not show Lemierre's or mediastinitis.
Blood cultures from admission were positive for GNRs, later grew out HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable and re-evaluation by ENT in the ICU showed improved of supraglottic swelling so she was transfered to the floor.
Patient continued to be symptom free on the floor and did not have any further airway complaints or problems.
#Erythematous lesion: Patient developed a 3X3 inch erythematous lesion on her anterior chest, 2 inches below cricoid and poorly demarcated.
The patient endorsed feeling warm and mildly tender to palpation in this area with no pruritis.
Given the timing of her antibiotics, this lesion was not felt due to drug eruption, although a very early drug eruption can not be ruled out.
The erythema was felt most consistent with a toxic exanthem, which is a vasodilation that occurs in patients with bactermia (more often staph, strep).
Derm did not feel compelled to biopsy - they thought it was likely due to her infectious process but did not represent a cellulitis.
#Pneumonia and pleural effusion: She was noted to have intermittent hypoxemia and R sided pleuritic chest pain on [**4-20**].
Medicine was consulted on [**4-22**], and in setting of new moderate pleural effusions R>L on CXR, recommended chest CT, which showed rapidly expanding and loculated effusion on R. She was then transferred to medicine, and ID was consulted.
Her pleural effusion was attempted to be drained by IR, but they only withdrew 30 cc of fluid, given loculation.
Thoracic surgery was then involved and carried out a VATS procedure which was uncomplicated and the patient was transferred back to medicine.
The patient's atenolol, lipitor were held in the setting of epiglottis/retropharyngeal phlegmon but restarted once she was able to tolerate POs.
bradycardia into the 40's atenolol was discontinued ad replaced with Chlorthalidone on [**4-25**].
# Intermittent bradycardia to 40s, asymptomatic: She was monitored on telemetry with occasional intermittent bradycardia to the 40s.
TTE was done which showed no HD significant pericardial effusion, abscess, or vegetations.
Her bradycardia may have been due to vagal tone in setting of pleural effusions and pleuritic pain.
# Lower extremity edema: She noted increased edema during this admission.
She had some baseline edema as a flight attendant but only while standing for long durations.
She had no JVD or HJR, and TTE was normal.

You were admitted with a severe throat infection and bacteremia with H influenza.
You also developed a rash on your chest thought to be due to this bacteria.
Your rash and throat improved, but you then developed shortness of breath due to increasing pleural effusions.
You were thought to have pneumonia, and your pleural effusion was treated by thoracic surgery with VATS procedure.
Medication changes: START Levaquin (aka Levofloxacin) for your infection STOP  Atenolol (this was stopped because your heart rate was low) START Chlorthalidone (for blood pressure control) .
Thoracic surgery Call Dr.[**Name (NI) 2347**] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2348**] if you experience: -Fevers > 101 or chills -Increased shortness of breath, cough (it is normal to cough-up blood tinge sputum for a few days) or chest pain -Incision develops drainage or increased redness -Chest tube site remove dressing and cover site with a bandaid until healed -Should site drain cover with a clean dressing and change as needed  Activity -Shower daily.
