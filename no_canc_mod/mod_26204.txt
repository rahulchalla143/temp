Replacement of Ascending Aorta and Hemiarch(30mm Gelweave Graft) with Reimplantation of Innominate Artery   History of Present Illness: This is an 82 year old male with known aortic stenosis and increasing episodes of presyncope.
Recent echocardiogram showed severe aortic stenosis with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.8cm2, peak 87 and mean 53 mmHg.
There was trace aortic insufficinecy and 2+ mitral regurgitation.
Subsequent cardiac catheterization showed heavily calcified aorta and dilated ascending aorta, measuring 5.1 centimeters.
Angiography revealed a left dominant system and an 80% lesion in the right coronary artery.
Past Medical History: Congestive Heart Failure, Aortic Stenosis, Ascending Aortic Aneurysm, Coronary Artery Disease, Peripheral Vascular Disease with Claudication, History of Stroke, Atrial Fibrillation, Sick Sinus Syndrome, Type II Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, Obesity, History of Silent MI, Prostate Cancer - Lupron Injections, Gout, Macular Degeneration, Neuropathy, Osteoarthritis  Social History: 30 pack year history of tobacco - quit 20 years ago.
Family History: No premature coronary artery disease  Physical Exam: Vitals: BP 126/70, HR 82, RR 18, SAT  95 on room air General: obese, slow moving male in no acute distress HEENT: oropharynx benign, no peripheral vision in right eye Neck: supple, no JVD, hard to asses JVD due to squat neck Heart: irregular rate, normal s1s2, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur  Lungs: clear bilaterally , diminished at bases Abdomen: soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds Ext: warm, 2+ edema, rubor present Pulses: decreased distally Neuro: PERRL, EOM not intact, CN 2-12 grossly intact, nonfocal, slightly decreased strength on left side, moves all extremities    Pertinent Results: [**2142-9-30**] 09:30PM BLOOD WBC-6.0 RBC-3.48* Hgb-11.0* Hct-33.6* MCV-97 MCH-31.8 MCHC-32.8 RDW-16.2* Plt Ct-191 [**2142-9-30**] 09:30PM BLOOD PT-13.0 PTT-37.5* INR(PT)-1.1 [**2142-9-30**] 09:30PM BLOOD Glucose-108* UreaN-21* Creat-0.9 Na-137 K-4.9 Cl-100 HCO3-27 AnGap-15 [**2142-10-1**] Carotid Ultrasound: No evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis in the carotid arteries bilaterally.
Increased linear markings involving both lung bases.
Findings represent atelectasis versus scarring.
Pneumonia is not entirely excluded.
No effusion detected.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 68565**] was admitted for heparinization and preoperative evaluation.
Workup was unremarkable, and carotid ultrasound showed only minimal disease of the internal carotid arteries.
On [**10-2**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] performed an aortic valve replacement and replacement of his ascending aorta and hemiarch with reimplantation of his innominate artery.
He initially required atrial pacing for junctional bradycardia.
He experienced urinary retention which required reinsertion of a foley catheter.
Before discharge, foley catheter was removed and he was voiding without difficulty.
He remained fluid overloaded with oxygen requirements.
Serial chest x-rays were significant for improving bilateral pleural effusions with persistent lower lobe atelectasis.
Microbiology showed gram negative rods and gram positive cocci, for which he was treated with levaquin.
Postop, he was also noted to have left upper extremity edema.
Ultrasound was obtained which showed no evidence of left upper extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Given his prior history of stroked with persistent left sided weakness, he worked with physical and occupational therapies to improve strength and mobility.
