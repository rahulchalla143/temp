Admission Date:  [**2129-1-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2129-1-14**]   Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post fall with left hip pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft), with aortic valve replacement in [**2113**], with known paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and reactive airway disease who has a history of falls.
The patient presents status post a mechanical fall at home with subsequent left leg pain and deformity.
The patient was assessed and stabilized in the Emergency Department and was subsequently brought to the operating room for an open reduction/internal fixation of his left intertrochanteric fracture on [**1-9**].
In the Postanesthesia Care Unit, the patient's blood pressure decreased to a systolic blood pressure of 78, and he spiked a fever to 101.7 degrees Fahrenheit.
His blood pressure returned to baseline without pressors, and his mental status improved.
He did have an episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on [**1-9**] and required one unit of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of less than 28.
He complained of mild nausea.
No chest pain.
No shortness of breath.
He noted pain at his left hip which was worse with movement.
Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement with a Porcine valve in [**2123**].
Benign prostatic hypertrophy; status post transurethral resection of prostate.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Anemia secondary to iron deficiency anemia and chronic gastrointestinal bleeds.
Congestive heart failure (with a prior transthoracic echocardiogram in [**2113-3-20**] with normal left ventricular systolic function with mitral regurgitation noted).
Recurrent mechanical falls; status post right hip fracture with open reduction/internal fixation and fracture of the ramus.
ALLERGIES:   The patient has no known drug allergies.
He was in no acute distress.
No jugular venous distention appreciated.
Lung examination revealed a poor effort.
Decreased breath sounds throughout and course at the bases.
Mild end-expiratory wheezes.
The abdomen was soft, mildly distended, and mild tenderness on the right.
Extremity examination revealed 1+ edema at the ankles (right greater than left).
Left hip with tenderness and swelling.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram on admission revealed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 83 beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals, poor R wave progression, and nonspecific ST-T wave changes in the inferior and lateral leads.
No acute ischemic changes.
A chest x-ray on admission revealed mild congestive heart failure with a small right pleural effusion.
Left hip films revealed an intertrochanteric fracture of the left proximal femur was seen.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old gentleman with coronary artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft and aortic valve replacement) with known paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and a history of falls who presented with a left femur intertrochanteric fracture after a mechanical fall at home.
The patient required open reduction/internal fixation of his left femur and subsequent Medical Intensive Care Unit stay.
The patient's left leg wound remained clean, dry, and intact (per the Orthopaedic team).
The patient did have an episode of hypotension while in the Postanesthesia Care Unit after surgery.
The patient did rule out for a myocardial infarction during his hospitalization.
During the [**Hospital 228**] Medical Intensive Care Unit stay, and for two days subsequent, the patient was noted to have low marginal urine output.
The patient had presented in atrial fibrillation and had recurrence of atrial fibrillation during his one day stay int he Medical Intensive Care Unit.
His anemia was thought to be related to intraoperative bleeding and postoperative changes due to femur repair.
There was no evidence of significant bleeding at the left femur site (per the Orthopaedic team assessment).
There was no hematoma formation.
His INR became markedly elevated above 5.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient had a fever to 101.7 degrees Fahrenheit postoperatively.
He had no obvious signs of infection after surgery, and the patient was continued on cefazolin intravenously q.8h.
The patient remained afebrile and stable.
Urine cultures and blood cultures showed no growth.
A chest x-ray showed no infiltrate.
Congestive heart failure.
Coronary artery disease.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

as needed (for shortness of breath or wheezing).
