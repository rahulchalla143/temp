There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and low normal global left ventricular systolic function.
No pericardial effusion.
There has been resolution of the pulmonary edema since the previous study.
There are no pneumothoraces or large pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 76M with h/o CKD on dialysis MWF, anoxic brain injury, TIIDM brought in from nursing home for respiratory distress and chest pain.
Active Diagnoses # Respiratory distress: Pt was volume overloaded given elevated JVP, diastolic hypertension and history of concern for insufficient fluid off at last HD.
# Chest pressure: He experienced chest pressure most likely attributed to demand ischemia in setting of volume overload.
#Hypoglycemia: Pt dropped to the 20s for glucose and was given in total 4 amps of dextrose, glucagon shot, and D10 drip and was transferred back to the icu for monitoring.
Of note, he should be covered by the night-time humalog scale on mornings that he has hemodialysis and does not eat breakfast, in order to avoid post-HD hypoglycemia.
# Chronic pain:  Remained stable.
# GERD: Stable.

As you know, you were admitted to the intensive care unit for difficulty breathing.
Unfortunately you suffered low blood sugar which was very difficult to treat and required us to send you back to the intensive care unit.
You did well and were able to be sent back to the general medical floor where you had no further complications and were safely discharged.
There were some changes in medication that we started at the hospital.
This means you will only get insulin if your blood sugar is over 201 on the mornings that you get hemodialysis to avoid having very low blood sugar.
