Baby was [**Name2 (NI) **] to a 39-year-old G4 P1-2 mother at 38-5/7 weeks gestational age by vaginal delivery.
There are no sepsis risk factors, with GBS negative, no maternal fever, rupture of membranes for three hours.
There are no known prenatal complications.
Neck:  Clavicles were intact with no crepitus or step-off.
Chest:  Moderate grunting, but with minimal retractions and flaring, some tachypnea, good air entry bilaterally, but coarse breath sounds.
Cardiovascular: Regular, rate, and rhythm with no murmur appreciated initially.
Abdomen:  Soft, nondistended, and nontender, hypoactive bowel sounds present, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Back and trunk:  There was a deep sacral dimple, but the base was visualized; there were no hair [**Hospital1 **].
ASSESSMENT:  Full term large for gestational age infant with respiratory distress at two hours of life.
No significant sepsis risk factors.
Admitted for respiratory distress and sepsis evaluation.
No cardiac evaluation was thought necessary and there is no murmur audible on the discharge exam.
No active cardiovascular issues.
Respiratory:  There was initial tachypnea and grunting with mild retractions and flaring.
By day of life two, the grunting, flaring, and retractions had completely resolved, and the patient was saturating in the mid to high 90s in room air.
An initial chest x-ray on admission was notable for some hazy right sided opacities that appeared most consistent with TTN but could not rule out pneumonia.
A repeat chest x-ray done on the day of discharge showed improvement of the right sided opacities, and therefore this rapid resolution was more consistent with TTN rather than pneumonia.
At discharge, baby was not tachypneic and was in no respiratory distress.
No further respiratory issues.
FEN/GI:  Initially, the patient was maintained NPO due to respiratory distress.
After 24 hours of life, his respiratory distress had improved to the point, where we started on ad lib feeds of Enfamil 20, discontinuing the D10W IV fluids as he had previously been receiving.
At discharge, he was taking E20 adlib well, without any coughing or sputtering.
Blood glucoses were in the normal range throughout the admission without any requirement for supplemental dextrose.
Because of the chest x-ray which was concerned for possible pneumonia and respiratory distress, the baby was started on ampicillin and gentamicin, which were discontinued after the blood cultures had remained negative for 48 hours.
A circumcision was performed on the day of discharge; at time of discharge, the circumcision dressing was clean, dry, and intact, with no bleeding, and a normal urine void post circumcision noted.
