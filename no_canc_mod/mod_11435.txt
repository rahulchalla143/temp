No evidence of pneumonia or overt CHF.
No acute intracranial process MR is more sensitive in the detection of acute stroke .
No PE Mild patchy opacifications both lobes raise poss of infectious process No effusions Vasc including coronary artery calcs GWlms   Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yoF long term nursing home pt with dementia who presents from the [**Hospital3 2558**] with dyspnea and confusion.
Initially noted to have wheezes on exam and be tachycardic.
CXR was unremarkable, and no acute cardiopulmonary process was noted.
CTA chest w/o PE or other reason for respiratory distress however she has slight bibasilar opacities.
Given that she is dehydrated it is possible her respiratory distress is related to pneumonia and obstructive airway disease.
She has an unknown smoking history and her daughter was [**Name2 (NI) 16535**] for collateral information.
As patient with possible infiltrates on CTA, low grade temp at [**Hospital3 **], respiratory distress and leukocytosis, she will be treated for nosocomial pneumonia with cefepime for 8 days.
A sputum sample was not able to be obtained for sputum culture.
# Confusion: This altered mental status was most likely secondary to respiratory distress and UTI.
Patient will be treated with cefepime for 8 days for possible pulmonary infections, and UTI.
CT head was negative for any intracranial pathology.
# UTI: Patient had a positive u/a at the [**Hospital3 **] and was started on levaquin.
Given that patient has a history of proteus resistant to cipro (in [**2190**]), quinolone was changed to cefepime (for PNA as above).
# Leukocytosis: Likely related to urinary tract infection and possible pulmonary infections.
# Elevated troponin: In the setting of sinus tach w/ PACs, hypertension, tachypnea so likely related to demand, especially since MB not elevated but small NSTEMI is also a possibility.
Given her h/o SAH and SDH, age, as well as likely demand, anticoagulation was held off.
# Elevated BUN, dehydration: Patient was given 1L normal saline after coming to ICU, and her BUN and creatinine trended down.
# FEN: Patient was seen by speech and swallow, who didn't note aspirations but couldn't rule out micro-aspiration unless a video swallowing study is done.
# Prophylaxis: Patient was on subutaneous heparin tid for DVT prophylaxis.
Tylenol 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO q6h prn as needed for fever or pain.
