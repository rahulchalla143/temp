Family reports that the patient had sudden onset of nausea at dinner.
Pt was intitially taken to [**Hospital1 **] where he was intubated without sedation.
Head CT showed a large intracranial hemorrhage.
Head CT was read as massive intraventricular hemorrhage filling lateral, third, and 4th ventricles, with hydrocephalus and transependymal migration of CSF.
Large hemorrhage within left centrum semiovale.
EKG sinus bradycardia with QT prolongation.
Pt's family that he be full code overnight so that family could be at bedside tomorrow for terminal extubation.
Past Medical History: Metastatic Colon Cancer Coronary Artery Disease s/p CABG x2 Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension Stroke   Social History: Lives with sons.
Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: General Appearance: Well nourished, No acute distress, Thin  Eyes / Conjunctiva: No(t) PERRL, No(t) Pupils dilated, No(t) Sclera edema, Pupils 4mm, fixed  Head, Ears, Nose, Throat: Normocephalic, NG tube  Cardiovascular: (S1: Normal), (S2: Normal)  Peripheral Vascular: (Right radial pulse: Present), (Left radial pulse: Present), (Right DP pulse: Present), (Left DP pulse: Present)  Respiratory / Chest: (Expansion: Symmetric), (Breath Sounds: Rhonchorous: )  Abdominal: Soft, Non-tender, No(t) Bowel sounds present  Extremities: Right lower extremity edema: Absent, Left lower extremity edema: Absent, No(t) Cyanosis  Skin:  Warm, No(t) Rash: , No(t) Jaundice  Neurologic: No(t) Follows simple commands, Responds to: Unresponsive, Movement: No spontaneous movement, Tone: Decreased   Pertinent Results: [**2101-11-16**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: There is a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage, likely originating from a parenchymal hemorrhage in the left centrum semiovale.
There is a large amount of hemorrhage filling bilateral lateral ventricles, temporal horns, third and fourth ventricles.
Associated ventriculomegaly is compatible with obstructive hydrocephalus, with periventricular white matter low attenuation suggestive of transependymal flow of CSF.
There is associated edema related to the left centrum semiovale intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
However, no significant shift of normally midline structures or central herniation is identified.
There is patchy opacification of the ethmoid air cells, with air- fluid levels in bilateral maxillary sinuses.
No significant interval change in a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage likely originating within the left centrum semiovale, with massive hemorrhage extension within the ventricular system.
Obstructive hydrocephalus, without herniation.
Brief Hospital Course: Evaluated by neurosurgery in the ED and it was determined that given the extent of intracranial hemorrhage that there was little chance of a meaningful recovery, and operative therapy was deferred.
Patient had evidence of [**Location (un) **] response with progressive neurologic deterioration.
