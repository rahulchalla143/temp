Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to extensive severe inferior and posterior wall hypokinesis/akinesis, apical dyskinesis, and hypokinesis of all other segments with relatively preserved function of the basal segments.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
with depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CHEST X-RAY ([**2135-1-21**]) IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary interstitial edema.
Worsened, now large left pleural effusion and left basilar opacification with component of atelectasis, though pneumonia is not excluded.
Read in conjunction with CT examination from [**2128**] which demonstrated concern possible left lower lobe lung mass, current radiograph is insensitive for confirmation, and correlation with interval imaging or a repeat CT examination can be performed as appropriate.
[**2135-1-22**] CXR: FINDINGS As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing basal opacity has completely cleared.
There seems to be an element of volume loss, leading to slight displacement of the heart towards the left.
The presence of a left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
This is a 88 year-old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2121**], CHF (EF: 25%), DM2, HTN, HL, a-fib who presents with dyspnea.
ACUTE SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE / DYSPNES: Pt with extensive cardiac history and last EF 25% likely secondary to ischemia.
The patient has a markedly elevated BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 8068**] (prior value ~5000).
Given his extensive cardiac history most likely etiology is CHF exacerbation, and during admission able to elucidate recent discontinuation of metolazone and drastic dose reductions in home furosemide, carvedilol and ACE-I.
CXR showed large left pleural effusion and atelectasis vs consolidation in the left base.
He does have leukcytosis and elevated lactate and received vanco/levo/CTX while more data was obtained, however all cultures remained negative and urine legionella antigen was negative; no leukocytosis or fever was observed.
Patient was given BIPAP initially and diuresed gently to avoid acute kidney injury.
Able to transition to supplemental oxygen without difficulty in MICU and patient was transferred to the floor for further management of his CHF exacerbation.
# DYSPHAGIA / ASPIRATION: After contacting [**Hospital1 **], it was communicated that there was high concern for aspiration and esophageal disorder.
Patient was noted to have some aspiration however esophageal motility seemed grossly appropiate.
Given aspiration unable to complete barium study, but aspiration precautions were intitated (chin tuck / multiple chews per bite / honey thickened fluids / pureed solids).
CAD s/p CABG [**2121**]: Pt with no evidence of active ischemia.
Slightly elevated trop of 0.04 with flat CK.
No ECG changes.
Ruled out by enzymes for acute event.
CHF: Last ECHO showed EF 25% with severe hypokinesis.
Pt likely volume overloaded as above.
A-fib: Patient with chronic atrial fibrillation, ?
tachy/brady syndrome requiring permanent pace maker.

We found that you had diastolic congestive heart failure due to your recent medication changes.
STOPPED: Percocet prn pain  - you were not in pain Lidoderm patch  - you were not in pain GLYBURIDE - 10mg qam 7.5mg qpm - did not require in house ISOSORBIDE MONONITRATE - 10 mg daily  - defer to restart in the future, you were placed on Metalozone for further diuresis, as your blood pressure is already within normal range, we did not feel that Isosorbide Mononitrate should be restarted at the time of your discharge.
