Admission Date:  [**2180-4-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2180-4-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2100-12-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from OSH with chest pain for consideration of cardiac catheterization.
Her husband called EMS and she complained of having chest pain for the prior four days, described as substernal chest pressure, rated [**9-8**].
She did endorse some nausea and lower extremity edema recently.
At the OSH she wsa noted to have ST elevations in I and L and new Q waves in the same.
She was given SL NTG for relief of her CP with intermittant success.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for 4/10 chest pain on arrival which resolved spontaneously; she denies dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Coronary artery disease status post CABG [**12/2172**] (SVG->LAD, SVG->OM, SVG->RCA) 2.
Hypertension X 40-50 years.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus X 14 years.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35%.
Carotid stenosis status post carotid endarterectomy in [**2166**] and [**2171**].
Spinal stenosis status post lumbar laminectomy L4-L5 in [**2168**].
COPD with FEV1/FVC of 65 or 91%.
Post-operative deep venous thrombosis status post CABG with coumadin subsequently discontinued for gastrointestinal bleed.
No percutaneous coronary intervention.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
Ext: Lt. pedal and ankle edema 1+.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Left atrial abnormality.
Prior anterior wall myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2173-1-21**] there is new T wave inversion in leads V4-V6 and associated ST segment depression which may represent an active lateral ischemic process.
Frequent atrial ectopy has appeared, while the intrinsic rate has slowed.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had a 50% stenosis at its origin.
The LAD had diffuse disease to 100% in the mid vessel.
The LCx had diffuse disease to 80% in the mid vessel.
The RCA had difuse disease distally to 80% and give rise to R->L collaterals that supplied the OM.
The final angiogram demonstrated no residual stenosis with no angiographic evidence of dissection, embolization or perforation with TIMI III flow in the distal vessel.
CXR [**2180-4-21**] Moderate cardiomegaly more pronounced, particularly due to left atrial enlargement.
Pulmonary vasculature engorgement is present but there is no edema or pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20-30 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the anterior free wall, lateral wall, and posterior wall, with extensive apical akinesis; the basal and midventricular segments of the inferior free wall contract best.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 year-old female with known CAD s/p CABG who presented to OSH after fall at home complaining of 4 days of CP found to have STEMI by new ST elevations transitioning to Q waves in I and AVL prior to transfer and positive Troponin I suggestive of subacute ST elevation MI.
The patient was initially maintained on heparin, integrilin, and nitroglycerin drips for control of chest pain in addition to aspirin, plavix, beta-blocker, ACE-inhibitor, and high-dose statin.
No further evidence of active ischemia.
Pump: Echocardiogram on this admission revealed depressed EF 20-30%.
Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine on admission was 1.1 for GFR 48.
This is likely secondary to the patient's longstanding hypertension and diabetes.
Her ACE-I was initially stopped in setting of very mild renal insufficiency and was restarted prior to discharge.
# Depressed mood: Throughout hosp course, pt had labile emotions and occasionally expressed loss of hope and "I want to die, I don't want any pain."
After speaking to her son, she has had several long hosp courses recently and since her lung cancer, she had had depressed mood.
# GI bleed: The patient had brown but guaiac positive stools during admission.
The patient has a known history of diverticulosis.
# Diabetes mellitus type 2: Oral regimen held.
# E. coli UTI: Pt developed a pan sensitive E. coli UTI on [**4-21**] and was started on Ceftriaxone.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for SOB, wheeze.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for SOB, wheeze.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] Of [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: ST segment myocardial infarction s/p stent placement in right coronary artery Hypertension acute renal insufficiency Secondary: Diabetes   Discharge Condition: stable, chest pain free   Discharge Instructions: You had a myocardial infarction or heart attack and had a stent placed in your right coronary artery.
