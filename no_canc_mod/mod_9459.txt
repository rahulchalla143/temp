Admission Date:  [**2104-7-7**]     Discharge Date:  [**2104-7-12**]   Service:  C-MEDICINE  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea on exertion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of two prior myocardial infarctions, most recent in [**Month (only) 958**], history of congestive heart failure, ejection fraction less than 30%, who now presents with two to three weeks of worsening shortness of breath, lower extremity edema and increasing abdominal girth.
He also noticed worsening orthopnea with regular episodes of having to sleep in a reclining chair.
He also reports paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
The lower extremity edema he says is completely new to him and is progressively getting worse.
He also reports increase in his abdominal girth.
Of note, when the patient presented with myocardial infarction in the past, his only complaint was shortness of breath.
However, the shortness of breath in the previous myocardial infarctions was much more severe than now.
He denies chest pain, nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for fever, chills, dysuria or change in appetite.
Coronary artery disease, catheterization in [**2104-6-9**], showed severe three vessel disease with severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures, mild aortic stenosis.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Diabetes mellitus type 2, medically controlled with oral hypoglycemic, diagnosed about twenty years ago with no complications.
Status post hernia repair.
In general, the patient is sitting in bed uncomfortable but in no acute distress.
Anicteric sclerae.
The neck is supple with jugular venous distention around seven centimeters.
Respiratory - Bibasilar crackles left worse than the right.
Cardiovascular - normal S1 and S2 with a II/VI holosystolic murmur at the cardiac apex radiating into the axilla.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, with positive bowel sounds, no liver edge, no shifting dullness, and no tenderness.
Extremities - 3+ pitting edema up to the knees, unable to appreciate pulses.
Cardiovascular - This congestive heart failure exacerbation appears to have been acutely worse than previous episodes.
It was unlikely that infection or ischemia was contributing to his congestive heart failure.
It was therefore that potentially bowel wall edema was decreasing the absorption of his p.o.
He was therefore started on intravenous Lasix to which he diuresed very well and lost about four kilograms in his body weight in the first two hospital days.
He had no complaints during his hospital stay.
In about five minutes, the bathroom was opened and the patient was found pulseless with no breathing and no pulse.
He was emergently transferred to the catheterization laboratory where emergent cardiac catheterization revealed severe three vessel disease with no evidence of acute thrombus.
He was transferred to the CCU where he remained unresponsive and developed severe hypotension requiring the use of four pressors.
