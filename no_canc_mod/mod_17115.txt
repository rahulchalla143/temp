Also complaining of R arm pain.
Presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital complaining of nausea, R arm pain, not following commands; CT head done with concern for intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the R lateral ventricle and pt.
CT head with no hemorrhage, CT C/T/L spine with no fracture or malalignment.
Several hours after extubation, he developed stridulous upper airway sounds.
His stridor was unresponsive to steroids and racemic epinephrine and he was reintubated (without e/o soft tissue edema per anesthesia) for airway protection.
While intubated it was found that there was no air leak even w/ the cuff down, of note, however, a larger ETT was placed (8.0) for second intubation and it was thought that perhaps the large tube size was preventing air leak rather than true airway edema.
He was transferred back to the ICU for closer monitoring and bronch vs. CT neck to eval.
for fixed lesion obstruction.
Pt was transferred on [**2181-1-4**] from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to [**Hospital Ward Name **] for OR-Rigid bronch, Flex bronch, dilatation (13.2cm), Tumor debridement (granulation tissue) and rigid forceps.

Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 79 M c NPH and VP shunt s/p fall with no associated trauma presenting because pt.
# Intubation: Pt.
had no clear evidence of respiratory failure and no clear reason for needed airway protection upon intubation at OSH.
By report, he was apparently agitated and was intubated in this setting in order to reduce his dislocated right shoulder.
Depspite good mechanics, 1st extubation c/b stridor resistent to racemic epinephrine.
He was intubated w/ a slightly larger tube (8.0) and was without air leak w/ balloon down suggesting airway edema.
He was started on dexamethasone without clear improvement of edema (still no air leak).
It was thought that perhaps he would not develop an air leak if ET tube was large enough in his airway compared to original tube even if edema was not present.
Thus, anesthesia was called to be present for extubation in case of failed extubation, but 2nd extubation attempt was successful without the development of stridor.
# Stridor: As above, patient developed stridor hours after first extubation.
2 days after his second extubation, he developed stridor on the floor.
He developed stridor after coughing and increasing his respiratory rate and the stridulous sounds resolved with normalization of his respiratory rate.
ENT was consulted and visualized his upper airway which revealed mild arytenoid edema thought not to be the cause of stridor.
CT neck was obtained which showed severe tracheal stenosis and interventional pulmonology was then consulted.
A rigid bronchoscopy was performed that revealed mild tracheomalacia and granulation tissue in the upper trachea was cleaned out.
He will need follow up with IP if stridor persists as a stent may need to be placed.
# Fall: By history, appears to be mechanical given known ataxia in setting of NPH.
When mental status cleared, he was able to repsond subjectively regarding pain and denied cervical soft tissue pain, so his c-spine was cleared and collar removed.
He does have baseline dementia per his daughter's report in the setting of his NPH, but peri sedation, he was much less responsive than his baseline.
He was evaluated by neurosurgery here and V-P shunt appears to be functioning properly w/o e/o of worsening hydrocephalus on CT head (CT also negative for bleed).
Aspiration pneumonia:  Was febrile with elevated WBC count on admission.
By hx, he had emesis x1 at OSH prior to intubation so there was concern for possible aspiration pneumonia.
He was started on Levo/flagyl and fever and white count resolved.
# Anemia:  Baseline hct appears to be high 30s from recent labs at PCP's office.
He had initial drop on admission without clear source.
No bleed on head on CT, no RPB on CT.  Stools were negative for blood.
Iron studies revealed normal iron, elevated ferritin and low TIBC c/w ACD, but does not account for the acute drop during his stay at [**Hospital1 18**].
Trace protein on admission UA, but negative for protein on subsequent UA.
# Hyperglycemia:  Throughout his stay, he had borderline blood sugars which became  markedly elevated while on steroids (for stridor) into the 180s.
He has no diagnosis of DM, but likely has baseline element of impaired glucose tolerance.
# Hypernatremia:  Sodium began to climb as his tube feeds had been held for extubation (he had not been getting free water flushes via his OG tube while previously intubated).
On the day of elevated sodium, patient's mental status was much improved and he reported feeling thirsty and diet was advanced.
# FEN:  During his hospital stay, there was some concern for aspiration with eating as he occasionally had coughing with PO intake.
