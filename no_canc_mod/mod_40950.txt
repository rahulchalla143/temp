The right internal jugular line tip is most likely at the junction of the right internal jugular vein and subclavian vein.
Interval development of mild vascular engorgement as well as new right lower lobe consolidation accompanied by right pleural effusion are noted that might represent aspiration or atelectasis and pleural effusion.
The intrathoracic volumes have slightly decreased, as a consequence the size of the cardiac silhouette has increased.
The extent of the right-sided pleural effusion is unchanged.
The lung parenchyma shows no evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia.
No pneumothorax.
No appreciable pleural fluid.
