Compared to prior now in atrial flutter as opposed to atrial premature beats.
She had no complaints of chest pain and her EKGs showed no ST/TW changes so she was essentially ruled out for MI.
She had some episodes of tachycardia (180 BPM) overnight and thus her toprol was re-started (12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]).
She had some bradycardia and then long pauses on telemetry requiring atropine.
For this she was transferred to the CCU for further management of her arrhythmias and potentially a PPM placement.
She had her pre-procedure dose of Vancomycin and after completion had some flushing of forehead and scalp.
She had no further complications.
She had no palpitations, sob, chest pain.
Her pacemaker site was without hematoma or sign of infection.
She had a followup chest x-ray that showed ppm leads in place.
Entero-cutaneous fistula: Throughout admission the wound looked clean and there was no significant discharge from it.
Urinary frequency: patient noted that she has no dysuria and that frequency is a common symptom for her for several years.
However, she was nervous about having an infection and wanted us to check it so a UA C+S were sent and were pending at time of transfer.
