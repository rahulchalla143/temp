Bilateral pleural effusions.
Conclusions PRE BYPASS The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %).
The right ventricle displays focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The systolic excursion of the mitral leaflets is restricted, posterior leaflet greater than anterior leaflet, resulting in a failure to coapt and severe mitral regurgitation.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There are bilateral pleural effusions.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is in situ.
There is trace mitral regurgitation.
The maximum pressure gradient across the mitral valve is 4 mm Hg with a mean of 2 mm Hg at a cardiac output of about 4.5 l/m.
FINDINGS: There are small bilateral effusions, left greater than right.
There is no focal infiltrate.
Compared to the recent study, there is no significant interval change.
Right bundle-branch block.
