Pt initially presented to [**Hospital3 4107**] with shortness of breath and general malaise.
Finished recent course of cipro for UTI and 1 dose Levoquin for cough.
Noted to have diffuse ST elevations and received aspirin, statin, heparin, plavix.
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, had fever, stool studies confirmed severe sepsis from C.diff requiring pressors.
He had NG placed for concern of aspiration; tube was unable to be placed sub-diaphragmatically due to a large hiatal hernia.
Pt transfered to floor on [**10-29**] but triggered for hypotension and returned to MICU.
Aspirin was stopped due to positive guaiac stools.
On the floor, pt was found to have a nonocclusive thrombus in the right subclavian vein surrounding the indwelling PICC catheter on [**11-7**].
Pt developed gauaic positive stools with bright red blood per rectum on [**11-8**].
Past Medical History: COPD Severe degenerative disk disease Parkinson's C. diff Basal cell Cancer Scoliosis GERD HTN h/o GIB childhood encephalitis bronchitis h/o chronic known dysphagia wirh prior modified consistency diet and nectar-thickened liquids.
NECK: supple, no adenopathy CHEST: Decreased breath sounds over left lung base, no rales, wheezes, rhonchi.
ABDOMEN: soft, nontender, nondistended, active bowel sounds, no masses palpated.
1+ pitting R hand edema up to elbow, trace pitting L hand / forearm edema.
no pedal edema.
Low frequency resting tremor.
SKIN: hyperpigmented areas around ankles bilaterally.
FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated no angiographically apparent flow limiting stenosis in the LMCA, LAD, LCx, or RCA.
Limited resting hemodynamic measurements (taken while the patient was receiving 8 mcg/min of levophed IV) revealed mildly elevated right atrial pressure (mean 9 mmHg) and normal pulmonary artery pressure (27/11 mmHg).
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Bilateral pulmonary consolidations, left more than right, could reflect aspiration pneumonia in the setting of hiatal hernia.
There is also an abnormal appearance to the hypopharynx, which is gas-distended with apparent external laryngoceles, which may relate to aspiration risk.
Massively distended sigmoid colon measuring up to 10.3 cm.
There is a transition point at the rectosigmoid junction with fullness in the rectum and associated mural edema.
Overall, these findings reflect potential rectosigmoid obstruction possibly from volvulus, occult mass or stricture.
Within limitations on non-contrast evaluation, no associated secondary signs of inflammation or ischemia were noted.
Cystic structure adjacent to the proximal third part of duodenum as described above may represent a duodenal duplication cyst/fluid-filled duodenal diverticulum.
Other differential considerations include cystic neoplasm or, less likely, aneurysm, overall incompletely evaluated in the non- contrast setting.
Laryngeal elevation and laryngeal valve closure were moderately reduced.
Moderate vallecular residue remained after the swallow, requiring multiple followup swallows to clear.
Episodes of aspiration were noted to occur after the swallow secondary to pharyngeal residue across all administered consistencies, including honey- thick liquid, nectar-thick liquid, and puree consistency.
However, acute and reflexive coughing was ineffective in clearing aspiration beyond the level of the vocal cords.
Initiation of cough was weak and ineffective in clearing the penetrated material.
Chin tuck techniques were attempted, but were ineffective in preventing or eliminating aspiration.
IMPRESSION: Oral and pharyngeal dysphagia, which is moderate, contributing to multiple episodes of aspiration .
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: In brief the patient is a 76 year old man with history prior c.dif colitis, and Parkinson's disease who presented with septic shock.
His course was complicated by septic shock secondary to c dif colitis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, PICC line-associated and spontaneous DVT but further complicated by hematochezia and worsening of his chronic dysphagia.
1)  C. difficle colitis and shock - The patient's initial clinical picture of C. diff colitis, hypotension and CT scan was concerning for toxic megacolon.
The inciting factors for C. diff exacerbation were thought to be cipro treatment and use of lomotil.
2) Atrial fibrillation with RVR - The patient had multiple episodes of AF with RVR during hospital course, thought to be secondary dehydration inducing tachycardia.
His atrial fibrillation has been paroxysmal.
Given he was found to have guaiac positive stools on subcutaneous heparin and aspirin alone and his atrial fibrillation has not been persistent and in the setting of severe illness, he was not felt to be a candidate for anticoagulation.
3) BRBRP/GI bleed- During his initial MICU course he was found to have guaiac positive stools on subcutaneous heparin and aspirin alone and given his severe illness and the absence of a-fib, he was not anticoagulated.
On his second return to the floor, the pt was found to have a nonocclusive thrombus in the right subclavian vein surrounding the indwelling PICC catheter on [**11-7**].
Pt developed gauaic positive stools with bright red blood per rectum on [**11-8**].
He was transfused 2 units with stable HCT overnight and no further episodes of melena or maroon stool.
Given the risk of ischemic bowel he had CT-Abd/pelvis that showed a likely new L femoral vein clot which is in addition to his known RUE DVT.
Pt underwent LENIS to further assess LLE clot, was found to have complete occlusion L popliteal vein extending into L common femoral; No DVT found in the RLE.
Given his risk of GI bleeding, pt could not be anticoagulated for his multiple DVTs.
The need for colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy was discussed with GI, and it was decided that there was no need for urgent colonoscopy and GI would prefer to defer given active inflammation and bowel wall thickening on CT, though they were improved from previous.
If acute bleed develops, tagged RBC or angiography would be considered.
His Hct slowly trended down w/o evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
4) Myocardial Ischemia - The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath as he was found to have elevated ST segments diffusely.
His cardiac cath demonstrated no flow limiting CAD on [**10-23**].
His aspirin was held for guaiac positive stools.
The EKG changes were thought to be secondary to a fixed lesion that was made evident by the high demands of his septic shock.
5) Parkinsons Disease - The patient was continue on Senemet 25-100 TID.
He was found to be a significant aspiration risk and has been made NPO.
He was additionally found to have extensive femoral-to-popliteal venous thrombosis on the left.
He had an IVC filter placed due to his contra-indication to anti-coagulation.
7) Sacral decub ??????
His wound was healing well at the time of discharge.
8) Back pain - chronic spinal stenosis.

10) FEN/GI: The patient had difficulty with placement of a feeding tube due to a large hiatal hernia.
Given the patient's severe C. diff infection he was not felt to be a candidate for surgical placement of a feeding tube at this time.
He is not a candidate for PEG placement due to his hiatal hernia.
