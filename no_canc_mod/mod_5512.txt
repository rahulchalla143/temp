Leukocytosis here.

Intubated, sedated on propofol HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dryMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: irregularly irregular normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops, non-displaced PMI Abdomen: obese soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, GU: foley Ext: warm, well perfused, no edema Neuro: PERRL, withdraws to painful stimuli bilaterally upper and lower extremities   Pertinent Results: CTA chest [**2158-10-15**] FINDINGS: Patient is intubated with the endotracheal tube ending 3.4 cm above the carina.
There is no aortic dissection or evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There is moderate cardiomegaly.
Fat density is noted within the interatrial septum, most likely due to lipomatous hypertrophy.
Suture material is noted at the left hilum.
There are dense calcifications also noted at the left lung base along the diaphragm, likely related to prior surgery.
There is minimal atelectasis in the remaining left lobe.
A 2-mm pulmonary nodule is noted within the right middle lobe.
Dependent atelectasis is noted posteriorly in the right.
There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy.
Visualized aspects of the upper abdomen demonstrate diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver.
BONE WINDOWS: No concerning osseous lesions are identified.
Mild  degenerative changes are noted throughout the visualized spine.
No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2-3 mm nodule in right middle lobe for which no follow up is needed if low risk (no underlying malignancy or smoking).
Status post left upper lobectomy.
Diffuse fatty deposition in the liver.
Echo [**2158-10-16**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = ?40 %).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild global hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, tachycardia, etc.
Dilated ascending aorta.
LIPID/CHOLESTEROL Cholest Triglyc HDL CHOL/HD LDLcalc [**2158-10-20**] 06:48    168 312*1 21 8.0 85        Brief Hospital Course: 51yo M with h/o DM and AF on coumadin presenting with AMS found to have HONC and RAF admitted to ICU for insulin gtt.
CXR revealed widened mediastinum and likely CHF although cannot r/o MF PNA.
Given concern for CAP vs. aspiration PNA, treated with CTX/azithro/flagyl.
# HONK / Diabetes Mellitus: Patient has no known h/o DM but FSBS in 800s at OSH with neurologic and electrolyte abnormalities consistent with HHS.
Patient never developed an anion gap.
Will have VNA for diabetes / finger stick and insulin administration teaching.
# Demand ischemia: Patient has elevated trop with lateral ST changes on EKG and no prior to compare with but in setting of AF with RVR so more likely demand than ACS.
TTE done that did not show any wall motion abnormalities, but did show reduced EF with global hypokinesis.
# Hyponatremia: Hypovolemic hyponatremia likely in setting of HHS however corrected Na is 136 so actually likely [**3-21**] hyperosmoloar state and only pseudo-hyponatremia.
# Atrial fibrillation: Presented in sinus rhythm with good rate control.
# Chronic systolic CHF: Unclear if diastolic or systolic.
Initially, lasix and zaroxylin held given recent [**Last Name (un) **] and needing hydration for HONK and being down for at least 1 day.
# AMS / Alcohol Withdrawal: Patient was agitated night after being extubated, combative and required restratints.
He then became very tearful and distressed in the afternoon, which resolved without support.
He also discussed paranoid delusions (thought he was being videotaped or in a moviem thought room decoration was changing) and some visual hallucinations.
No blood products as patient is a Jehovah's witness.
Humalog 100 unit/mL Solution Sig: 0-16 Units Subcutaneous four times a day as needed for high blood sugar: Please check fingersticks prior to meals and administer insulin per sliding scale.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2) Puffs Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Secondary Diagnoses:  Systolic Heart Failure, Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response, Alcohol Dependence, Type II Diabetes Mellitus, Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Hypothyroidism, Hypertension, Back Pain   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for high blood sugar due to undiagnosed diabetes that was likely worsened by pneumonia.
Your pneumonia was treated with IV antibiotics.
You were treated for your withdrawal with valium.
By the day of discharge you were no longer showing signs of withdrawal and did not require any valium.
You also complained of chronic back pain.
If your pain is too severe to respond, you can try oxycodone for your pain.
Importantly, you should STOP drinking alcohol as you are causing extreme harm to your health and are at danger as well for dangerous withdrawal when you stop drinking suddenly.
Please follow-up with a primary care physician in the next 7 days for further management of these problems.
