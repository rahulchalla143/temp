Two weeks ago, she began to have increasing pain in her toe and instep, and noticed that her toe appeared darker.
She describes her pain as [**2-4**], in her 3rd toe and instep of her left foot.
Additionally, she complains of a stinging pain in her great toes bilaterally secondary to gouty arthritis.
She denies prior foot ulcers or injury, as well as numbness or tingling in her feet.
She has had recent falls without injury after tripping over the cord for an electrical blanket.
On review of systems, she has had recent nosebleed and asthmatic symptoms.
She denies HA, dizziness, CP, SOB, fevers/chills, abdominal discomfort, dysuria, urgency, or muscular weakness.
She has had some recent intentional weight loss.

Sclera anicteric.
No conjunctival pallor.

No organomegaly or mass.
Microbiology: Blood Cultures x 2 ([**1-2**]) No growth Wound Swab: MSSA, Group B Strep (Levo resistant), and diptheroids Urine cultures: ([**1-4**]) No growth ([**1-7**]) <10,000 organisms/ml.
Indistinct cortical contour of terminal tuft of the left third distal phalanx, concerning for osteomyelitis, related to an adjacent ulcer.
Cystic change in the first metatarsal head is likely degenerative, related to the hallux valgus deformity, although the less likely possibility of gout could be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
[**1-3**] Lower Extremity Arterial Doppler: IMPRESSION:  Significant bilateral popliteal/tibial artery occlusive disease with severe flow deficit to both forefeet.
[**1-6**] Stress P-MIBI: IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms with an uninterpretable EKG for ischemia.
Compared with the study of [**2100-9-17**], no significant change.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with no evidence of parenchymal consolidation.
Mild symettric [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] promince suggests possible fluid overload related to underlying renal condition.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Brief Hospital Course: In the ED, she was seen by podiatry, who probed her wound to bone, obtained wound and blood cultures, and ordered Chem 10, CBC, coags, lactate, ESR, and foot xray.
1) Toe ulcer: Ms. [**Known lastname 8884**] presented with an ulcer that had been present for six months with fluctuating course, and was found to be osteomyelitis after being probed to bone, with possible cellulitis spreading in foot.
[**Known lastname **] insufficiency was confirmed by doppler of lower extremities and ABIs which showed significant bilateral popliteal/tibial artery occlusive disease with severe flow deficit to both forefeet.
Additionally, she was found to have poor proprioception in her toes on admission.
[**Month/Year (2) **] surgery was then consulted:  [**Month/Year (2) **] procedures:  [**11-9**] - Diagnostic abdominal aortogram and pelvic arteriogram with unilateral lower extremity runoff, contralateral third order catheterization, primary balloon angioplasty of the anterior tibialis x 3.
2) Acute on chronic renal failure: Ms. [**Known lastname 8884**] had had a prior nephrectomy for secondary FSGS and a perinephric abscess.
Lasix was D/C'ed as there was no evidence of volume overload.
She had had a previous failed attempt at AV fistula formation due to poor vessel quality, so she then received a central venous dialysis catheter.
The etiology of the acute renal process was never definitively determined, although it was thought that there may have been contribution from medications, volume depletion, or an intrinsic process.
There were signs suggestive of an intrinsic renal process, including Albumin:Cr of 176 (Serum albumin low at 2.8, LFTs normal) and granular casts were noted on urinary sediment, suggestive of ATN.
Renal function - ESRD .
Anemia - epo 10,000 units at HD .
3) Orthopnea- Ms. [**Known lastname 8884**] developed positional dyspnea on [**1-8**], which was though to be likely due to volume overload, as she had received approximately 1 liter of IV fluids in the preceding day as renal protection for scheduled angiography.
A CXR was c/w volume overload.
4) Dermatomal vesicular rash- First noted by the patient on [**1-8**] on chest midline T4, tender to light touch.
A DFA came back negative for VZV on [**1-11**], and acyclovir was discontinued.
5) Type II Diabetes: Ms [**Known lastname 8884**] has longstanding DM that she says is controlled by diet alone and her HbA1c has always been less than or equal to 6.4%, which implies reasonable control.
She says that she is followed by an ophthalmologist at [**Hospital1 18**] and that she does not have any ocular disease.
There was no record of significant blood loss during IR procedure.
She had no sign of hematoma at procedure site.
A haptoglobin, LDH, and TBili were not consistent with a hemolytic process.
2 units pRBCs were given [**1-7**] with an appropriate response, and she experienced no further drop in hematocrit.
On [**11-14**] it was thought that the pt developed a psueedo anuerysm post cath.
Pt experienced extreme thigh pain / dropped her pressure.
Pt was taken to the the OR emrgently for hematoma evacuation and repair odf her femoral arery.
7) Asthma: Ms. [**Known lastname 8884**] has had no prior hospitalizations or oral steroid use for her asthma.
She had an exacerbation on [**1-4**] at night, but responded to albuterol inhaler with no further exacerbations.
8) Atrial fibrillation/flutter: Ms [**Known lastname 8884**] has a history of paroxysmal A-fib.

If you have any questions or concerns please talk with your doctor or nurse.
Premature closure or healing of the skin can result in infection.
Your wound was left open to allow new tissue growth within the wound itself.
The wound is covered with a VAC dressing.
The VAC:  _ helps keep the wound tissue clean  _ absorbs drainage  _ prevents premature healing of skin  - promotes healing  When to Call the Doctor:  Watch for the following signs and symptoms and notify your doctor if these occur:  Temperature over 101.5 F or chills  Foul-smelling drainage or fluid from the wound  Increased redness or swelling of the wound or skin around it  Increasing tenderness or pain in or around the wound   Followup Instructions: Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) **],[**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] SURGERY (NHB) Date/Time:[**2108-2-10**] 2:30  Provider: [**Name10 (NameIs) **] CALL Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 59**] Date/Time:[**2108-2-21**] 9:30  Provider:  [**Name10 (NameIs) 676**] CLINIC Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 59**] Date/Time:[**2108-5-21**] 9:00    Completed by:[**2108-1-27**
