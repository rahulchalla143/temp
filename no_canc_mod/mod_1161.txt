<br> PERSANTINE MIBI  [**2111-12-30**] PERSANTINE MIBI INTERPRETATION: This 50 year old type 2 IDDM woman with a history of [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular failure was referred to the lab for evaluation.
No arm, neck, back or chest discomfort was reported by the patient throughout the study.
There were no significant ST segment changes during the infusion or in recovery.
The rhythm was atrial fibrillation/flutter throughout with rare isolated vpbs.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.
Reason: 50 Y/O WOMAN WITH AFIB, DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE, AND FLASH PULMONARY EDEMA, EVAL REVERSIBLE WALL MOTION ABNORMALITIES SUMMARY OF DATA FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:  Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142 mg/kg/min.
She had no ischemic symptoms or ECG changes.
INTERPRETATION:  The image quality is adequate but limited due to breast attenuation.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the left ventricular myocardium.
There is worsening of pulmonary edema, now severe.
Small right pleural effusion is probably present.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
No ductal stones are present.
No evidence of biliary dilatation.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 50 y/o F w/ h/o DMII on oral agents, complains of 2 weeks of nausea/vomiting, decreased PO intake, and abdominal pain .
# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure Patient's volume status was continuously in flux.
She had two episodes of flash pulmonary edema requiring transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for BiPAP therapy and aggressive diuresis.
The etiology was likely A-flutter/A-fib with RVR versus hypoglyemia precipitating catecholamine surge causing htn vs anxiety provoking htn.
During the second episode she was noted to be hypoglycemic prior to becoming short of breath.
During the course of her hospitalization, she was ruled out for an MI and underrwent a P-MIBI which was negative for ischemia (showed resolution of previous lateral wall motion abnormalities).
This raised the suspicion for an infiltrative process such as amyloid.
During the course of her hospitalization, she was seen by cardiology consult who helped with titration of her medications.
After aggressive diuresis with IV lasix, her volume status improved and she was switched to PO lasix.
She is to follow up in the heart failure clinic and was sent home with careful electronic monitoring of weight and blood pressure.
# Atrial flutter/Atrial Fibrillation Rate controlled varied during the course of her hospitalization.
She was maintained on coumadin with decrease of INR prior to discharge due to a decrease in her dose (secondary to hematuria).
However she had hematuria and Lovenox was subsequently stopped.
# Hematuria As described above.
# Hypertension Blood pressure varied as described above.
# Abdominal pain/[**Name (NI) 9532**] Unclear etiology, but evaulation in ER demonstrated no acute abdominal pathology on CT, and pelvic ultrasound showed only fibroid uterus with normal ovaries.
# Acute on chronic renal failure Had major fluctuations in creatinine.
likely anion gap [**3-20**] to mild lactic acidosis and uremia from renal insufficiency.
Elevated bicarb/hypochloremia in setting of diuresis and vomiting.
# DM-II, controlled- Initially held oral hypoglycemics in setting of renal insufficiency and recent CT. Sulfonylurea (Glucotrol XL) subsequently restarted, however pt had hypoglycemic episode as described above and this was stopped.
# Depression/Anxiety - cont paroxetine initially, then psychiatry consulted and decided to cross taper paroxetine to fluoxetine given longer half-life which will be beneficial from a medical adherence standpoint.
She was given Valium for anxiety, but was discharged on Ativan per psychiatry's recommendation.
# Cough Patient reported upper respiratory symptoms during course of her hospitalization.
She was afebrile with normal WBC count and no evidence of infiltrate on her chest x-ray.
On discharge she reported resolution of cough and upper respiratory symptoms.
# Outstanding Issues: -consider fat pad biopsy for amyloid -consider w/u for secondary causes of htn -monitor INR -monitor HR/BP/weight -monitor response to Fluoxetine -repeat UA to ensure no microscopic hematuria -consider BiPAP for OSA -H. Flu in [**Name (NI) **], consider therapy vs. repeating.
Ativan 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for anxiety.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Atrovent HFA 17 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) puffs Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute on chronic diastolic CHF with episodes of hypoxia Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease Secondary: Hypertension Atrial Flutter/Atrial Fibrillation Anxiety Diabetes Mellitus, Type II Obstructive Sleep Apnea   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because you initially had nausea, vomiting, and a change in your kidney function.
You subsequently had worsening of your heart failure.
Your Glucotrol XL is being held since you had low blood sugars.
