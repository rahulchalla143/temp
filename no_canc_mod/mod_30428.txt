Moderate cardiomegaly is stable, with atherosclerotic calcifications of the aortic arch.
There are increased interstitial markings bilaterally, suggestive of mild fluid overload, with a slightly more confluent opacity within the right mid lung, also likely reflecting edema.
There are small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax is appreciated.
IMPRESSION: Mild CHF with bilateral pleural effusions.
[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT Severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
No vegetations seen, but cannot be excluded due to suboptimal acoustic windows.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-1-12**], stenotic aortic valve has been replaced with a mechanical prosthesis.
Worsening CHF with increasing edema and slight increase in effusions.
Circumferential left pleural opacity, likely due to loculated pleural effusion, but malignant pleural disease could produce a similar radiographic appearance.
Continued radiographic followup recommended to document resolution following treatment of the acute process.
If this fails to resolve, contrast-enhanced CT may be helpful to look for areas of enhancement or nodularity.
Bilateral, partly organized pleural effusions with bilateral intrafissural and left paramediastinal component.
The effusions would be consistent with the clinical history of chronic cardiac insufficiency.
Moderate mediastinal lymphadenopathy, that would equally be consistent with a clinical history of chronic cardiac insufficiency.
Cardiomegaly with marked coronary calcifications, status post aortic valve repair.
Right apical emphysema, small subpleural areas of parenchymal fibrosis, no evidence of lung nodules or masses suspicious for malignancy.
Extensive calcifications of the upper abdominal arteries.
Brief Hospital Course: # Hypotension: At initial presentation, there was concern for infection given leukocytosis and fever with hypotension.
Initial differential including pneumonia, bacteremia related to LLE graft / ulcers / osteo and cardiac decompensation in the setting of heart failure.
Pressures remained stable during the initial part of hospitalization and the patient was restarted on carvediolol for improved rate control in the setting of atrial fibrillation.
On [**9-10**], antibiotics were discontinued as patient had been afebrile since admission with normalizing white counts and clinical picture clear for exacerbation of CHF.
# acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: At initial presentation patient had substantial pulmary vascular congestion, peripheral edema, mild elevation in JVP and pt's history of progressive wt gain supported an acute on chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation.
His symptoms seemed subacute and progressive over past few months and likely made worse by volume resuscitation in the ED.
Patient was subsequently started on lasix with  substantial diuresis and substantial subjective improvement in symptoms throughout his hospitalization.
Echo was performed which showed severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD, normal-functioning mechanical aortic valve prosthesis, moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension and no vegetations seen.
Digoxin was continued for improved ionotropy in setting of systolic heart failure and lasix and carvedilol re-started for diruesis and afterload reduction.
Once sepsis was ruled out and antibiotics stopped he was re-started on to improve rate control.
On transfer to the medicine floor the patient was found to be tachycardic up to 150s on several occasions.
Upon transfer to the medical floor his INR became subtherapeutic and his coumadin was increased.
The risks of having a stroke or of his mechanical AV malfunctioning were explained to the patient on several occasions but he remained adamant about leaving the hospital.
# Loculated pleural effusion: Patient was found to have a loculated effusion on CXR and the result confirmed by CT chest.
Testing revealed that the fluid was consistent with a transudative process.
Cytology was done and it revealed atypical cells, many lymphocytes and some enlarged forms.
This could be consistent with a reactive lymphocytosis or a lymphoma.
He will be contact[**Name (NI) **] if cytology/flow suggest malignant process.
He was given a prescription to repeat CT chest in 5 weeks to evaluate for continued resolution or re accumulation of the pleural effusion.
# DM II: He was continued on his outpatient regimen of lantus and humalog.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Last Name (LF) 486**], [**First Name3 (LF) 487**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure Loculated Pleural Effusion Atrial Fibrillation  Secondary Diagnosis: Type 2 Diabetes   Discharge Condition: Good.
You were found to have low blood pressure.
You initially were admitted to the intensive care unit for closer monitoring of your respiratory status.
In the ICU, it appeared that you were having an exacerbation of your congestive heart failure.
While you were here, you were also found to have a small pocket of fluid around your lungs.
This was drained by a thoracentesis, and the fluid was sent off for cytology.
The fluid did show an abnormal type of cell, which may be from your congestive heart failure.
We placed you on Lovenox to prevent these complications until your INR is therapeutic.
Please stop this medication when your INR is 2.0-3.0, or when instructed by your cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 95337**]  Please return to the ED or your healthcare provider if you experience chest pain, increased shortness of breath, weakness, increasing fatigue, fevers, chills, or any other concerning symptoms.
