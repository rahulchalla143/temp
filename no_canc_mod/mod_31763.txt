Admission Date:  [**2148-3-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2148-3-25**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Placement of single chamber pacemaker (ventricular)  History of Present Illness: 88 yo M with a history of paroxysmal a fib, CHF, ASD, goiter, PVD, polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], chronic GIB on warfarin and recently started on atenolol, admitted with complaints of shortness of breath found to have profound bradycardia with high degree heart block.
A recent discharge summary from an admission starting on [**2148-3-12**] at [**Hospital3 **] describes symptomatic shortness of breath noted by [**Name Initial (MD) **] home NP.
The patient was treated for worsening anemia (Hct 23 on admission down from previous baseline of 35 in [**2147-11-13**]) in the setting of supratherapeutic INR.
EGD during this hospitalization revealed non-bleeding ulcers in the stomach and Barrett's esophagus.
ACEi was not started because of acute on chronic renal failure (Cr of 1.9 up from previous 1.5 many months prior).
In the ED, the patient was persistently bradycardic to 30-40 with complete heart block vs. high degree AV block on EKG.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: Cardiac Risk Factors: Diabetes .
Other: Multinodular goiter GERD with esophagitis and non-bleeding gastric ulcers on recent EGD ([**2-20**]) Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] DM, diet controlled Nephrolithiasis  Social History: Lived alone and administered his own meds prior to recent hospitalization.
No tob or EtOH.
Integumentary: Chronic venous stasis changes in the bilateral lower extremities.
[**4-18**] systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border.
Pansystolic mrumur at the apex.
Abd: Soft, nondistended, no masses or organomegaly.

No prior for comparison.
[**2148-3-18**] CXR: Pulmonary edema; the markedly abnormal cardiac silhouette suggests either underlying cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion (or both).
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM ([**2147-3-20**]): The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
A secundum type atrial septal defect is present with right to left shunting.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted with bradycardia with high degree heart block.
Atenolol use in the setting of acute renal failure likely worsened his bradycardia, but it was felt that his underlying conduction disorder had worsened and that he would benefit from placement of a pacemaker.
He had significant blood losses during the procedure, requiring transfusion of one unit of PRBC's.
Heparin for his AFib was restarted the morning after the procedure, and coumadin was restarted 48 hours after pacer placement.
On admission, his heart failure had been exacerbated by the bradycardia, and he had evidence of volume overload with crackles on lung exam.
He was aggressively diuresed and had improvement in his volume status.
He was admitted with acute on chronic renal failure likely secondary to hypoperfusion with his bradycardia (Cr 2.0 on admission; baseline uncertain but pt has history of DM and vascular disease).
Creatinine improved somewhat with control of his CHF exacerbation and placement of the pacemaker.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Last Name (un) 1687**] - [**Location (un) 745**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Bradycardia  Secondary Diagnoses: Congestive heart failure-- diastolic Gastroesphageal reflux disease Diabetes mellitus-- diet controlled   Discharge Condition: Stable-- heart rate in the 50 - 60's; satting in the mid to upper 90's on 2 Liters supplemental oxygen; breathing comfortably.
Because your heart rate was low, you had an exacerbation of your heart failure, requiring removal of fluid from your body with medications.
