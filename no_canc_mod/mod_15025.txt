It started with pain in the back of his neck that his primary care physician thought were muscle spasms.
It was a sharp pain that would shoot down his right arm, exacerbated by head motion.
Three days or so later, he noticed tingling in his hands and couldn't tell the temperature was his fingertips.
The initial neurologic examination showed left-sided hand intrinsic weakness overcome with fair effort and right deltoid, biceps, and triceps weakness.
Sensation was decreased to pinprick from C6-T2.
There was hyperesthesia in the C5-6 distribution on the left.
The initial presentation was suggestive of a multifocal process felt most likely to be acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.
A diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis was made and steroids were started.
There was significant improvement in his right arm weakness and complete resolution of truncal sensory loss.
One week prior to this admission, he had a severe shocking type of pain in his head with a throbbing quality.
Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
Right arm fracture, status post motor vehicle accident, status post surgery with placement of a metal plate.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
There are no neurological diseases or autoimmune diseases.
In general, he was a well-nourished young man in no distress.
There were no carotid bruits.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
He has no apraxia.
He has no nystagmus.
There were no fasciculations.
Motor examination: He had normal bulk and tone throughout, no tremor.
There was no sensory level to pin in the chest.
There was a subjective feeling of tingling in the hands bilaterally.
Chest x-ray:  No acute process.
The initial C2-C3 lesion in his spine had expanded down to C7 and he had a new lesion in the conus.
The right parietal occipital lesion had decreased somewhat size and no longer extended across the corpus callosum and the areas of enhancement are reduced.
A brain biopsy was considered to determine pathologically what [**Known firstname **] diagnosis is, however, this was deferred as the constellation of clinical findings including the lesion location, the rapid progression, and the response to steroids were all consistent with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.
