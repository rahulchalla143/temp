Admission Date: [**2159-8-23**]        Discharge Date: [**2159-8-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2159-8-23**]        Sex:  M  Service:  NB   HISTORY:  Baby boy [**Known lastname **] is a 30 week gestation infant born weighing 2.24 kg, admitted to the NICU for prematurity, upper airway obstruction, immature lungs with respiratory failure and abdominal ascites of unknown etiology.
Maternal history: 36-year-old, G3, P2, white female with history of recent diagnosis of large fetal ascites within past week prior to delivery associated with lung compression and no evidence of hydrops.
Differential etiologies include perforated bowel, obstructive lymphatic drainage, or urinary ascites.
Mother had spontaneous premature rupture of membranes revealing clear fluid on [**2159-8-23**] at 5 a.m. with onset of contractions.
Mother's labor progressed despite trial of tocolysis with magnesium sulfate.
Due to concerns related to potential soft tissue dystocia with vaginal delivery a decision was made to deliver by cesarean section.
Thus there was unanticipated airway narrowing below the vocal cords.
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM: There were no murmurs auscultated on several examinations.
No masses palpable.
No hepatosplenomegaly noted although the abdomen was difficult to examine due to distention.
GENITOURINARY: Normal premature male with edematous scrotum due to the ascites.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  RESPIRATORY:  The infant remained intubated, was given a total of 2 doses of surfactant and weaned to extubatable settings by day of life 1, remained intubated due to concerns aboput possibel airway obstruction if extubated.
The infant developed a large air leak around the 2.0 ET tube at which time the ventilator settings were low, and a blood gas was overventilated.
[**Hospital1 **] was consulted and a decision was made to extubate the baby at the bed side and call [**Name (NI) **] for further concerns with breathing difficulties.
The infant was extubated on day of life # 3 and initially looked well, however he slowly and progressively developed worsening respiratory stridor and retractions which were more pronounced when agitated or stimulated.
Echocardiogram was done on [**2159-8-24**] that showed a small patent ductus arteriosus, patent foramen ovale, right ventricular and pulmonary hypertension, mild dilated right ventricle with depressed function and normal left ventricular function.
The infant did receive abdominal paracentesis on the newborn day at which time 150 cc of fluid was removed from the abdomen.
The infant has had no further hematocrits measured.
No blood typing had been done and since then the infant has received no blood product transfusions.
There was no left shift.
If there are any psychosocial concerns she can be reached at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8717**].
Abdominal ascites.
Respiratory distress syndrome.
Sepsis ruled out.
Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.
