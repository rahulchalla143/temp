He was initially seen at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital where CT scans demonstrated a Le Fort fracture, left proximal humerus fracture with associated dislocation, rib fractures, left tib-fib fracture, small left pneumothorax.
He is currently complaining of pain to his left upper and lower extremity and his face.

Hyperdense thickening compatible with hematoma seen in the retroperitoneum on the right, adjacent to the IVC, inferior to the renal vein, and posterior to the duodenum and pancreatic head.
Differential includes a venous injury (including IVC or right renal vein), duodenal injury, pancreatic injury, or nonspecific post-traumatic hematoma.
No definite injury to any of these adjacent structures is identified.
Focal thickening of the sigmoid colon in the left lower quadrant, with adjacent stranding and mesenteric edema.
There are underlying diverticula.
There is associated free fluid seen in the pelvis.
[**2148-11-2**] Left tib-fib : Comminuted, intra-articular proximal tibial fracture and transverse proximal fibular fracture, as above.
Cross-sectional imaging may be helpful for further characterization.
[**2148-11-2**] Left humerus: Comminuted, displaced fracutre of the left humeral surgical neck, extending through the greater tuberosity.
Comminuted oblique intra-articular fracture of the proximal tibia, involving both tibial plateaus, and a portion of the posterior metaphysis, with depression, posterior displacement, and distraction as detailed above.
Comminuted, segmental fracture of the proximal fibula.
No central or large segmental pulmonary embolus.
Limited assessment of subsegmental vessels but adequate distal perfusion.
Development of complete collapse of both the right and left lower lobes, and posterior segment of the right upper lobes, with moderate-to-large pleural effusions bilaterlly.
Poorly evaluated abnormal collection of soft tissue material and air at the gastroesophageal junction measuring 5 cm.
Considerations include esophageal trauma, interval increase in a previously small hiatal hernia, or conceivably, a mediastinal abscess.
Further radiologic evaluation depends on the ability of the patient to ingest oral contrast material; if possible, fluoroscopy and/or swallowing CT could provide further information.
Evidence of sternal impaction injury with focal cortical irregularity anteriorly at the manubrium.
He was taken to the Operating Room for ORIF of his left humerus and left tibia which he tolerated well.
His hemodynamics were stable after resuscitation with fluid and blood.
He also had an Opthomology exam for bilateral contusions and there was no evidence of herniation just some periorbital edema and ecchymosis.
His pain was controlled with IV dilaudid.
The Maxillofacial surgeons planned for stabilization after some of his edema resolved.
His pain was well controlled.
His chest Xray revealed bibasilar atelectasis and he was subsequently transferred back to the ICU for further management.
He had a Chest CTA which ruled out PE and showed bilateral lower lobe collapse.
