Non-specific ST-T wave changes, most notable in leads VI-V2.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2128-5-11**] atrial fibrillation has replaced sinus bradycardia.
TTE ([**2146-7-21**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is at least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, with evidence of right ventricular pressure overload and consequent ventricular interaction.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Mild pulmonary edema and small left pleural effusion.
Ill-defined opacity in the left lung base is nonspecific, but could reflect an area of atelectasis, or possibly infection.
There is persistent atelectasis versus developing infiltrate at the left lung base.
There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema or pneumothoraces.
Overall, there has been no interval change.
There is some atelectasis at the lung bases.
There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema.
There is some prominence of some of the interstitial markings and atelectasis of the left lung base which is stable.
There is minimal wedging of several mid thoracic vertebral bodies.
AP PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY ([**2146-7-25**]): Lung volumes are lower today, exaggerating relative caliber of distended mediastinal veins and the extent of moderate cardiomegaly.
Thoracic aorta is quite tortuous and aneurysm is not really evaluated by this study.
Pleural effusion is minimal if any.
No pneumothorax.
V/Q SCAN ([**2146-7-25**]): Multiple mismatched perfusion defects bilaterally consistent with very high likelihood ratio of acute pulmonary embolus.
# Dyspnea secondary to pulmonary embolism: Initially attributed to diastolic CHF based on age, history of diabetes, JVP of 10-12cm and pleural effusion on CXR and BNP >10k, although dry mucus membranes and no edema peripherally.
Diastolic dysfunction was confirmed by echo.
Also initially considered was PNA given hypothermia, but no history of cough and only mild leukocytosis to 12.1k.
Initially Troponins negative x2 and no evidence of ischemia by EKG.
Pulmonary embolism was also initially considered, but other etiologies including diastolic dysfunction were more likely initially and despite vague shoulder pain, no frank chest pain and no stepwise changes in dyspnea; patient described it as progressive shortness of breath.
She was then switched to PO levoquin and dyspnea continued, with desaturations to the 80s with ambulation.
When patient did not improve with aggressive diuresis and leukocytosis increased to 20K, other etiologies were reconsidered.
Repeat troponins were not consistent with an acute ischemic event.
AGB was consistent with primary metabolic acidosis, with normal anion gap, with superimposed respiratory alkalosis and an Aa gradient of approximately 50.
The evening of [**7-25**], patient's entered atrial fibrillation with RVR with decreasing O2 saturations, decreasing blood pressure to 80s systolic and no urine output.
She was noted to have dusky, cool, pulseless LLE, possibly arterial thrombus showered from atrium in setting of RVR.
She was started on peripheral norepinephrine and levophed drips for hypotension.
As her presentation was consistent with massive PE causing hemodynamic instability, lysis with TPA was attempted.
Daughter specified she did not want central line placed, and updated code status to DNR/DNI in light of severity of her illness.
Over the next six hours after TPA infusion, patient's oxygen requirements continued to increase and she became increasingly hypotensive with rising pressor requirements and agonal breathing.
infection as above versus other process as hypothyroidism or poor cardiac output.
No evidence of Q waves on EKG.
Echo without wall motion abnormalities.
Patient was continued on ASA 81mg qd and simvastatin 40 mg daily  # DM complicated by protinuria.
We held glipizide 5 mg daily  # Atrial fibrillation: CHADS 2 of 4, although not anticoagulated due to risk.
This was discontinued on [**7-25**] when patient entered into [**Last Name (un) **] from combination of diuresis and pulmonary embolism  # Recent corneal transplant with history of glaucoma.
