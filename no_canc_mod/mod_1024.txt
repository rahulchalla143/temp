CXR ([**2129-4-6**]): CHF and effusion with slight interval worsening.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No definite vegetations seen.
CAROTID US ([**2129-4-8**]): 60-69% stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid arteries; however, this estimate of percentage of stenosis may not be precise due to a generalized increase in systolic velocities in the bilateral common and internal carotid arteries.
CT CHEST ([**2129-4-9**]): Interval worsening of right lower lobe opacity, and development of hazy lingular opacity, likely representing infiltrates, with adjacent pleural thickening.
No intrinsic or extrinsic airway obstruction is identified.
Hyperkalemia/ESRD: Presented with hyperkalemia (>7) in the setting of 2 dialysis sessions in 10 days.
Presented with chest pains which were concerning but in the setting of persistent nontypical pain, this was thought to be likely secondary to other causes.
Did have CK and troponin elevations, but has chronic troponin elevations.
Rhythm: Presented in sinus bradycardia though briefly had junctional bradycardia while in the ED.
This may have been secondary to combination of both beta blocker effect (in the absence of dialysis) as well as severe hyperkalemia.
Pneumonia: Found to have RLL opacity on CXR with leukocytosis and cough.
Treated as a community acquired pneumonia with azithromycin and ceftriaxone (changed to cefpodoxime upon discharge).
A CT was performed which showed "Interval worsening of right lower lobe opacity, and development of hazy lingular opacity, likely representing infiltrates, with adjacent pleural thickening."
Upon discussion with radiology, it was recommended that an outpatient PET scan be obtained (to evaluate for possible malignant process).
Pump: Presented with a history of CHF in OMR but normal function on last echo and nuclear study.
Did have volume overload initially, but improved greatly after dialysis and was euvolemic upon discharge.
Chest pain: Potential causes include angina, esophageal irritation, anxiety among other causes of atypical chest pains.
Hyperkalemia 2.
End-stage renal disease 3.
Coronary artery disease 2.
Diabetes mellitus   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, saturating well on room air.
