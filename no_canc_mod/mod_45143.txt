Change in mental status:  The patient's altered mental status improved slightly after extubation in the Intensive Care Unit.
She had recovered from her acute renal failure, therefore, it was felt by her ongoing infection was causing her mental status to be unclear.
Infectious disease:  The patient was given three chest tubes to suction, to drain ceftriaxone resistant and meropenem resistant Pseudomonas empyema.
She had undergone evacuation of the hematoma without decortication on [**2159-5-2**].
She was transferred to the floor with two chest tubes to drainage and one chest tube for irrigation and then eventually the two chest tubes were put to water-seal.
She also had right internal jugular central line which had been placed on admission that was a risk for infection, but the patient was not manifesting fever or elevated white count, and the line was watched and was attempted to be changed on the day prior to death.
On the day of death, the patient became hypothermic to 93.3 tympanic despite some warming blankets.
An Infectious Disease consult was obtained for management of multidrug resistant empyemas as well as to consider other sources of infection.
They recommended Vancomycin for possible line sepsis causing the clinical picture of hypothermia as well as oliguria.
In addition, fungal cultures and blood cultures were obtained to try to elucidate the mechanism of sepsis and fluconazole was administered for concern of fungal sepsis.
On the evening of [**5-14**], the patient became bradycardic to about the 30s and remained unresponsive.
The rhythm varied from bradycardia to asystole to pulseless electrical activity.
The mechanism of death was felt to be sepsis due to unknown source of infection.
