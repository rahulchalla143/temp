PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Reveals a vigorous, non-dysmorphic, premature infant.
He has occasional episodes of apnea and desaturation, the last episode occurring on [**2127-6-5**].
There are no cardiovascular issues.
Gastrointestinal:  The infant was treated with phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity from day of life number three until day of life number nine.
The etiology of his hyperbilirubinemia is presumably exagerrated physiologic due to prematurity, with some residual secondary to breastmilk jaundice.
There is no ABO set-up with mother A+ and baby [**Name (NI) **], [**Name2 (NI) **] negative.
There has been minimal change in his hematocrit making chronic hemolysis unlikely with an admission hematocrit of 44 and a repeat hct on [**2127-6-10**] of 35.9 (35.8 on [**6-7**]), the reticulocyte count is pending at this time.
Infectious Disease:  The infant was started on ampicillin and gentamicin at the time of admission for sepsis risk factors.
Medications:  The infant is discharged on no medications.
Status post hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity 5.
