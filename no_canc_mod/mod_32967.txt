Diff negative X 3 [**2112-5-10**], [**2112-5-19**]: urine cultures contaminated  Studies: [**2112-5-12**] Angiography/Cath of Mesenteric Vessels: ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS: 1.
Elongated 2.5-cm long stenosis of approximately 70% to the superior mesenteric artery with post-stenotic dilatation.
There was an initial 15-mm gradient which was reduced to less than 10 mm systolic after second ablation of the 7-mm balloon.
80% focal stenosis of the proximal celiac artery successfully stented with a 7 x 18-mm Genesis stent.
There was no residual systolic gradient after completion of the stent.
A small brachial artery required cutdown initially for access and was repaired using interrupted Prolene sutures without difficulty.
There is still present interstitial pulmonary edema, slightly asymmetric with more involvement of the right side, most likely due to patient positioning.
Small right pleural effusion is noted, slightly increased since the prior study but still small.
There are no areas of focal consolidation worrisome for infection.
Findings compatible with anasarca, with diffuse soft tissue stranding/edema, marked bilateral effusions, and free fluid within the abdomen and pelvis.
No specific evidence of bowel ischemia.
No pneumotosis or free air.
No obstruction.
[**2112-5-19**] CXR, pa and lateral: Slight worsening of congestive heart failure with increasing interstitial edema.
[**2112-5-20**] KUB: Improved bowel gas pattern with air noted throughout non-distended loops of large and small bowel.
No evidence of obstruction.
[**2112-5-22**] CXR, portable: There is no significant change in the right PICC line, pacemaker, sternal wires and mediastinal clips, small bilateral effusions, left greater than right, and mild interstitial edema similar in appearance compared to the prior study.
The colon is prominent measuring up to 5.7 cm with some air-fluid levels.
Brief Hospital Course: 77yo F w/hx of CAD, CHF, PVD, DM2, afib who presents as a transfer from an OSH for evaluation of abdominal pain and mesenteric ischemia.
On [**2112-5-12**], patient became hypoxic and tachypneic likely secondary to volume overload; she was given lasix and transferred to the MICU.
Then she was taken to the OR by the [**Date Range 1106**] team and had a brachial artery exposure and repair with celiac artery stent x1 and superior mesenteric stent x2 placed.
She began to c/o increased abdominal distention; abdominal xray revealed likely ileus; she was made NPO.
She only could tolerate minimal clears with recurrent abdominal pain.
On HD8/POD4, [**2112-5-16**] noncontrast CT abd/pelvis was done, which showed findings compatible with anasarca, with diffuse soft tissue stranding/edema, marked bilateral effusions, and free fluid within the abdomen and pelvis, but no specific evidence of bowel ischemia, pneumotosis, free air, or obstruction.
o/n, she c/o worsening lower abd pain with some nausea and minimal emesis.
Medicine Team Updated Hospital Course: Upon transfer, Ms. [**Known lastname 6185**] had evidence of pulmonary edema and active heart failure based on symptoms and CXR findings.
The EGD and colonoscopy were planned given her continued symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, however these were deferred given her tenuous respiratory status and inability to lie flat.
Her abdominal symptoms improved over the next few days and her was able to tolerate clears on [**2112-5-20**].
As symptoms resolved, it was felt that EGD and colonoscopy were not indicated given risks associated with procedure.
Mesenteric Ischemia: s/p SMA and celiac stents.
On discharge, she was 100% on RA and basilar crackles on exam.
Bowel: KUB was consistent with ileus which is resolving.
She was put on colace and senna PRN for bowels and had small loose stool on the day of discharge.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Mesenteric Ischemia 2.
Acute on chronic systolic heart failure  Secondary: - CAD status post IMI and CABG - Atrial fibrillation/SSS status post pacemaker - Stroke - CKD stage II/III - PVD status post aorto-bifemoral bypass - Diabetes mellitus type II - COPD - Hypertension - Gout - s/p hemigastrectomy for peptic ulcer disease - s/p cholecystectomy - s/p bilateral cataract surgeries   Discharge Condition: afebrile, hemodynamically stable, eating and drinking without pain, nausea or vomiting   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for nausea and abdominal pain.
You should call your doctor or return to the hospital with any fevers > 100.4, chills, night sweats, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, leg swelling, skin rashes or any other symptoms that concern you.
