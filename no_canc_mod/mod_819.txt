Extensive areas of intraparenchymal, subarachnoid, and subdural hemorrhages, have not significantly changed compared to the most recent study done approximately three hours earlier.
There is no significant change in the surrounding edema, around the left parietal intraparenchymal hematoma.
No obvious new areas of hemorrhage are noted.
There is mild mass effect, on the left lateral ventricle, which is not significantly changed.
There is mild shift of the midline structures to the right side, unchanged.
Small retention cysts are noted in the left maxillary sinus.
There is unchanged appearance of the hyperostosis of the left frontal and the squamous temporal bones and small amount of pneumocephalus.
CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE HEAD: Significant atherosclerotic vascular calcifications are noted in the intracranial arteries, in the vertebral, in the cavernous carotid segments as well as extending into the supraclinoid segments and the distal vertebral arteries, right more than left.
The major intracranial arteries are otherwise patent, without focal flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm.
The right distal vertebral artery, is markedly narrowed in caliber, which may be related to hypoplasia and superimposed atherosclerotic disease and stenosis.
No significant change in the multiple areas of intracranial hemorrhage, with some surrounding edema and minimal shift of the midline structures.
No evidence of aneurysm.
Extensive/significant atherosclerotic disease, in the intracranial arteries, predominantly in the right distal vertebral, cavernous segments, with decreased flow in the right vertebral artery, which may be due to hypoplasia and superimposedatherosclerotic stenosis.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**3-17**]: IMPRESSION: No appreciable increase in extent of multi-compartmental hemorrhage with bilateral subdural hematomas, diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhages, and multifocal hemorrhagic contusions.
Increasing hypodensity surrounding areas of parenchymal hemorrhage is consistent with continued evolution of areas of contusions.
There is tiny new right lateral intraventricular hemorrhage.
Mild leftward subfalcine herniation and mass effect on the left lateral ventricle is similar to that previously seen.
However, they appear  disproportionate to the amount of parenchymal blood, as much of the hemorrhage in this region, particularly on the right, appears extra-axial, and wedge-shaped rather than rounded.
CHEST (PA & LAT) [**3-19**]: In comparison with the study of [**3-17**], there is no change on the frontal view.
The heart is within normal limits in size and there is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
On the lateral projection, there is suggestion of some increased opacification posteriorly in the lower lung zone.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS [**3-19**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
Most conspicuous are bilateral frontal and temporal lobe IPH, with significant associated underlying edema, presumably secondary to contusion.
There are no areas of new hemorrhage.
There is no transtentorial or uncal herniation appreciated.
There is no definite intraventricular hemorrhage appreciated on today's study.
There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
No vegetation identified.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) [**2164-3-22**]: The liver demonstrates normal echotexture and architecture, without focal liver lesion seen.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation is noted; the common duct measures 6 mm.
The gallbladder appears normal, without evidence of stones.
The pancreatic body and tail is obscured by overlying bowel gas; the visualized portions of the body and head appear unremarkable.
No ascites is seen.
Note is made of a 9 mm right lower pole cyst, otherwise no evidence of stone, hydronephrosis or solid mass is seen in the kidneys.
IMPRESSIONS: No abdominal pathology seen to account for the patient's symptoms.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2164-3-22**] Continued evolution of multifocal intracranial hemorrhage, with decreased density and conspicuity of blood products on today's study.
Extensive edema is unchanged, with most prominent edema seen in the right frontal lobe, resulting in mass effect upon the adjacent sulci, frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the ipsilateral ventricle, and subfalcine herniation.
No findings to explain leukocytosis and daily fevers.
Numerous diverticula of the descending and sigmoid colon without acute diverticulitis.
Extensive atherosclerotic calcification.
Multiple nodules in the right lobe of the thyroid.
Brief Hospital Course: On [**3-13**], Mr. [**Known lastname 8360**] was admitted to ICU for frequent neurologic monitoring and assessment after abnormal behavior reports by family, and aphasia.
Throughout the admission, he has had a fever from 101-102, treated [**Date range (1) 8361**] with Ciprofloxacin for urinary tract infection.
Patient was transferred to the Medical service on [**2164-3-21**] given no planned neurosurgical interventions and persistent fever and leukocytosis.
The rest of his hospital course (on the medical service) is as follows:  # FEVER / LEUKOCYTOSIS:  Upon transfer, etiology had not been identified despite extensive work-up.
Specifically, he has had negative blood cultures, urine cultues without an identifiable pathogen and negative imaging including repeat CXR and LENIs.
Given that he is hospitalized, there is always concern for C.diff but abdominal exam fairly benign and no reported loose stools.
Also would consider aspiration PNA given poor swallowing but no changes on CXR.
Given prolonged bed rest, at risk for skin breakdown but no evidence of this given nursing diligence with turning.
No appreciable murmur on exam, but previously instructed to take antibiotics with dental procedure so may have valvular abnormaliteis.
[**Month (only) 116**] also be due to an intra-abdominal process such as acute hepatitis given LFTs elevated, but not to the point of an acute viral process.
Did not performed LP given acute bleed and at low risk for a concurrent meningitis.
Other considerations included drug fever (though no clear causative agents), central fever s/p SAH or occult seizure activity.
TTE [**3-21**] without clear vegetations but Echo poor quality due to patient unable to cooperate fully with exam.
[**3-22**] RUQ ultrasound ordered for transaminitis revealed no intrabdominal pathology.
Stool culture were no growth.
CT chest/abd/pelvis was obtained to assess for occult infection and revealed no evidence of an infectious process.
After an extensive work-up, infectious disease signed-off on [**2164-3-24**] as fevers were thought to likely be of central origin.
# Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: Noted on OSH CT with expected evolution per NeuroSurgery.
On AEDs already given h/o seizure s/p meningioma resection.
NC-CT head [**3-22**] with expected interval change, no worsening edema or midline shift.
Also planned to have PT/OT at rehab.
# HYPERTENSION: Elevated inpatient and likely [**2-20**] central process.
# DIABETES: Initially on regular sliding scale, will transitioned to humalog SS.
# HYPOTHYROID: TSH checked inpatient and found to be 0.51.
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Longstanding and s/p TIA in past.
Denies history of coronary disease per wife.
[**Name (NI) **] Simvastatin given transaminitis but should be restarted as ; restart ASAP  # ASPIRATION RISK: Patient on aspiration precautions and s/p speech and swallow evaluation with modifications per their recommendations.
# BPH: Urinating s/p foley removal.
Volume status difficult to assess as patient unable to fully cooperate with exam but no peripheral edema, MM appear moist.
Urine Osm / Na consistent with SIADH.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day): Hold for loose stools.
If markedly different than discharge or concerned for acute process, please further evaluate as necessary.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Bilateral Subarachnoid Hemorrhage, left Subdural hematoma, fever  Secondary: Seizure disorder, hypertension   Discharge Condition: Neurologically and hemodynamically stable.
