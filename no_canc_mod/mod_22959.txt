Admission Date: [**2201-5-12**]        Discharge Date: [**2201-6-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2201-5-12**]        Sex:  M  Service:  Neonatology  IDENTIFICATION:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 1794**] is a 24 day old former 35 [**4-28**] wk premature infant with a history of respiratory distress syndrome and apnea of prematurity who is being discharged from the [**Hospital1 18**] NICU.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby boy [**Known lastname 1794**] is a 3.8 kg product of a 35 [**4-28**] week gestation born to a 28-year-old G2, P1, woman with history of type 1 diabetes.
Mother presented on day delivery with lower abdominal pain, and ultrasound suggested a thin-walled uterus.
With her history of diabetes and prior c-section, mother was considered to be at high risk of uterine dehiscence, and she was taken for elective c-section.
The NICU NNP was called to the delivery room at approximately 10 to 15  minutes of age for respiratory distress.
Mild to moderate grunting, flaring, retracting on cannula.
He was on nasal cannula briefly with increased oxygen requirements, and was transitioned quickly to CPAP.
He continued to have increased oxygen requirements.
Chest x-ray was consistent with moderate hyaline membrane disease.
He has subsequently been on room air without evidence of respiratory distress.
The infant has had mild apnea/bradycardia events, with the most recent episode of apnea/bradycardia on [**2201-6-1**].
These events have been mild, occasionally requiring stimulation but mostly self-resolving and characterized by brief dips in heart rate and oxygen saturation.
They are presumed to be secondary to apnea of prematurity or immaturity of respiratory control.
A murmur was noted to develop, thought to be most with consistent with persistent pulmonary stenosis.
He received phototherapy for a total of 24 hours at which time it was discontinued and he has had no further issues.
The infant has had no further issues with sepsis.
Respiratory distress syndrome treated with surfactant.
Rule out sepsis with antibiotics.
Mild hyperbilirubinemia.
Apnea/bradycardia of prematurity.
Murmur, likely peripheral pulmonic stenosis.
