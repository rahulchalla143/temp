It appears from the record that Mr. [**Known lastname 11622**] had presented to the ED with complaints of seeing "flashing lights" associated with a headache today.
He also complained of nausea and vomiting.
The nursing notes are difficult to read, however it appears that he had vomiting while there prior to his CT.
The image showed a 2cm R occipital bleed and a repeat study 3 hours later was stable.
His labs at [**Hospital1 2436**] showed a metabolic acidosis with a low HCO3 and an anion gap of 19.
His tox screen was positive for THC.
He had LOC for a few seconds but was reportedly back to baseline immediately without evidence of being post-ictal.
Past Medical History: Hepatitis C - reports receiving treatment but details unknown  Social History: -heavy and longstanding tobacco use -No EtOH or drug use per girlfriend -works from home as a currency exchanger   Family History: Father with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer.

Hyperacute parenchymal hemorrhage with small amount of surrounding edema in the right occipital lobe as described above.
If the hemorrhage was secondary to a small AVM, this would not be detectable on MRI, and if clinical concern present, a conventional arteriogram is recommended.
Intensely enhancing lesion with irregular borders in the atrium of the left lateral ventricle with associated cystic component indenting into the superior ventricular.
Given that similar enhancement characteristics are noted and a focus of choroid plexus appears to extend towards this region, this most likely represents a focus of ectopic choroid plexus.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to NSICU and successfully extubated the next day - initially was quite agitated requiring several doses of haloperidol, possibly due to the R occipital hemorrhage but soon improved with redirection provided per 1:1 sitter.
He was also loaded with Dilantin and was continued on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.
He underwent angiogram per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**9-23**] without complications, which raised the possibility of an occipito-temporal arteriovenous fistula.
During the admission he was noted to have progressive CK elevations, and had mild rash around his neck.
Disp:*1 1* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Right parietal-occipital intracerebral hemorrhage seizures   Discharge Condition: stable with mild residual visual changes   Discharge Instructions: You were admtted to this hospital because you developed visual changes and headache, while in the outside hospital you had a generalized seizure.
You underwent a head CT which showed bleeding in the posterior aspect of your brain.
To evaluate the cause for this bleeding you had a brain angiogram, the first test showed a possible fistula in your vessels but because of the amount of the bleeding and movement artifact a second angiogram was required.
Please call Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] or return to the emergency department if you have visual changes, persistent headache, mental status change, weakness, dizziness or seizures.
