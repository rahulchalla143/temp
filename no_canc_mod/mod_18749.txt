ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY)  Reason: NECROTIZING PANCREATITIS, R/O GALLSTONES  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 67 year old woman with acute necrotizing pancreatitis REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o gallstones PORTABLE ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND:  There is diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver with focal areas of sparing in the region of the porta hepatis.
Additionally, multiple hypoechoic lesions are seen scattered throughout both hepatic lobes.
The largest lesion in the left hepatic lobe measures 1.8 x 1.3 cm.
The largest lesion in the left hepatic lobe measures approximately 0.4 cm in maximum dimension.
Further characterization with MRI or CT may be helpful and/or correlation with prior cross-sectional imaging if available.
There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
There is nonspecific gallbladder wall thickening.
Evaluation of the pancreas is markedly limited due to overlapping gas-filled loops of bowel.
No focal peripancreatic collections are noted.
A non-obstructing left renal stone is noted.
There is no hydronephrosis in either kidney.
No evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Distended gallbladder containing sludge with nonspecific gallbladder wall thickening.
No focal peripancreatic fluid collections identified.
The rest of the lesions are nonspecific and may represend solid lesions or abscesses.
Further evaluation with MRI or CT or correlation with prior cross-sectional studies may be helpful.
4.Non-obstructing left renal stone.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2154-7-20**] 1:37 PM There are low inspiratory volumes and mild blurring due to patient respiratory motion.
Again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small bilateral pleural effusions, with atelectasis at the right base.
No pneumothorax is detected.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2154-7-20**] 6:07 PM [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 67 year old woman with acute necrotizing pancreatitis, now desatting to low 90s on 7L O2 Nc, RR=30 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: rule out PE IMPRESSION: 1.
No evidence of any pulmonary embolus.
Bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis and some consolidation.
Small amount of perihepatic ascites.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2154-7-23**] 4:27 AM IMPRESSION: Stable bilateral pleural effusions and stable left retrocardiac opacity.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild (12mmHg) resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction that increases to 24mmHg with Valsalva manuever.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse or systolic anterior motion ([**Male First Name (un) **]).
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with hyperdynamic systolic function.
Mild resting LVOT gradient that slightly increases with Valsalva.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Is there a history to suggest high output syndrome (anemia, thyrotoxicosis, sepsis, fever, thiamine deficiency, Paget's disease, etc.)
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 67 year old woman with history of hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension who presents with 24 hours of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, found to have pancreatitis.
# Pancreatitis.
Found to have necrotizing pancreatitis on CT at OSH.
We monitored her LFT's, Amylase, and Lipase as these numbers slowly declined and her pain resolved/ .
# Hyperglycemia: Due to her necrotizing pancreatitis, she required an Insulin drip while in the ICU and then required SQ insulin and a sliding scale.
# Respiratory Distress She was transferred out to the floor and then on [**7-20**], she was transfer back to the SICU - 88% on 13L mask, RR=30.
A CTA chest showed no evidence of any pulmonary embolus, bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis and some consolidation, right subclavian central venous line in situ, subcentimeter mediastinal lymphadenopathy, some perihepatic ascites She was fluid overloaded due to the aggressive hydration and required intermittent Lasix for diuresis.
She received 20IV lasix and a CXR showed some bilateral atelectasis and pleural effusions.
#Pain: She received Fentanyl and Morphine for pain control.
# Hypothyroidism.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
