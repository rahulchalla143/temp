Ulcers were complicated by cellulitis and treated with intravenous antibiotics multiple times.
The patient had a biopsy of those ulcers, which showed leukocytoblastic vasculitis.
The patient presented on [**2183-10-22**] to this hospital with shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion.
She had a chest CT at that time, which showed patchy ground glass opacities.
She underwent bronchoscopy and was found to have bloody frothy sputum that was felt to be consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
Both the Pulmonary Service and Rheumatology Service felt the vasculitis was the most likely source to this.
She had no complaints of fevers or chills.
No complaints of nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
No complaints of shortness of breath until the morning of admission when she woke feeling "awful" per her husband.
Around [**Name2 (NI) **] of that day she became acutely short of breath, gasping for air.
Of note, the patient had developed a new rash on her feet and fingers over the weekend prior to admission.
The patient also has a history of arthritis and chronic pain.
History of depression, history of migraines, history of multiple pneumonias prior to this admission and a history of vasculitis as detailed in the history of present illness.
She had no conjunctival petechia.
The patient's neck was plethoric, however, supple without lymphadenopathy.
Lungs were remarkable for coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination was difficult due to body habitus, but was regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs.
The patient's abdomen was benign, soft, obese with multiple surgical scars, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
The patient's extremities were notable for a macular rash across her feet and toes that was becoming confluent.
She had clean ulcers around her ankles bilaterally with no discharge and good granulation tissue.
She also had several more clean ulcers on her left lower extremity in the shin area some of which had yellow brown eschar.
Her fingers were notable for small purple lesions less then 2 mm in diameter that were scattered across her fingertips.
Chest x-ray on admission showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates particularly on the right that were consistent with an ARDS like picture as well as bilateral patchy alveolar infiltrates.
IMPRESSION:  In short this is a 55 year-old female with P-ANCA positive vasculitis and known diffuse alveolar hemorrhage presenting with a new rash, acute shortness of breath and hypoxic respiratory failure.
Respiratory failure:  The patient was profoundly hypoxic with a few bloody secretions and suctioning and ARDS like picture on chest x-ray.
The patient underwent bronchoscopy the day after admission and was found to have diffuse petechia within her large airways, scant blood in her bronchi and minimal to no mucous.
The patient's bronchoscopy samples were sent for a fungal, bacterial and viral cultures.
The patient was gradually weaned from her oxygen, however, she still had a significant oxygen requirement on discharge requiring 4 liters of oxygen at rest to maintain saturations above 90%.
Rheumatology:  The patient has a known history of P-ANCA positive vasculitis.
Her P-ANCA titer was quite elevated on admission in the range of 60,000.
The patient's Cytoxan was held upon admission due to concern of opportunistic infection.
The patient's vasculitic ulcers on her legs were cared for in the MICU by nursing staff.
Likely the drop in her hematocrit was due to her diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
Infectious disease:  The patient had a low grade fever at the time of admission and a bandemia.
Urinalysis prior to discharge was concerning for urinary tract infection, however, was contaminated with a large amount of squamous epithelial cells.
The patient was allowed to care for her own leg ulcers, which she treats with a combination of benzoperoxide cream and dilute acetic acid washes once a day.
Pain:  The patient has a history of chronic pain after which she is treated with Oxycontin 30 mg po b.i.d.
