This pregnancy was uncomplicated until the mother was admitted on [**2179-2-26**] due to premature cervical dilatation associated with vaginal bleeding.
Ultrasound demonstrated a footling breech with estimated fetal weight of 594 grams, in the 42nd percentile.
She received Pitocin following progressive dilatation, and declined cesarean section due to increased risk with classical incision, including infertility.
Mother did receive antibiotics greater than four hours prior to delivery, and other than premature delivery, the infant did not have any other sepsis risk factors.
No maternal fever, no fetal tachycardia.
Prior to delivery, several attending neonatologists spoke with the mother regarding viability issues at this gestational age and the potential for severe long-term neurological sequelae.
The rest of the infant's body emerged soon after but, due to severe clamping of cervix, head delivery was delayed.
He had first signs of respiration with gasps at about five minutes of age.
The infant was without evidence of spontaneous activity, and continued with gasping intermittently.
Significant bruising, especially the left leg, left hand and slightly over the right leg.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Hypotonia noted diffusely.
No spontaneous activity noted except for the right arm jerks, which was not consistent with seizure activity since it was able to be stopped when held, and no association with vital sign changes.
Chest x-ray initially showed a high endotracheal tube that was advanced, bilaterally well-expanded lungs, evidence of reticulogranular pattern, diffuse, consistent with hyaline membrane disease.
Umbilical lines in good position, and no pneumothorax.
He received a total of 12 mEq/kg of bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis.
As stated previously, chest x-ray was consistent with hyaline membrane disease.
He did not have any signs of patent ductus arteriosis.
Was receiving initially maintenance intravenous fluids, and then was started on hyperalimentation and interlipids for nutritional support.
He did not show any evidence of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
He did receive one blood transfusion of 15 cc/kg initially after birth because of his hypotension.
Neurology:  Because of his initial perinatal depression and clinical examination and gestational age, head ultrasound was done on day of life one.
This was very concerning, and showed diffuse parenchymal echogenic areas bilaterally.
Neurological examination was abnormal, with little spontaneous movements, no spontaneous respirations, and flaccid tone.
The baby also received fentanyl from his time of birth as needed for pain control.
Dermatology:  Skin was extremely bruised, with necrotic-looking areas on the right lower leg, and also had abdomen breakdown.
There was extreme bruising diffusely noted in various areas of the body.
The father arrived on [**3-6**] in the morning, and was updated in several meetings on [**Known lastname 4946**] progress, with the long-term prognosis and serious concerns for devastating sequelae given early manifestations including significant perinatal depression, persistent abnormal neurological examination, diffuse posterior sagittal echodensities on head ultrasound, and seizure activity.
