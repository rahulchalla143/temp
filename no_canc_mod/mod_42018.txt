He represented to OSH 2 days later found to have weakness, pain and decreased urine output.
Initially there was concern for possible HRS so he was fluid challenged with albumin and initially treated with octreotide and midodrine.
He had an abdominal ultrasound which showed normal sized kidneys without evidence of obstruction.
He initially underwent CVVH in the ICU, and was eventually able to transition to HD given that he was no longer hypotensive s/p the removal of 4 L of fluid after a paracentesis.
Per renal, his renal failure was likely due to ATN.
Given that he is currently dialysis dependent, he did not continue midodrine and octreotide.
He was started on nephrocaps and calcium acetate  # Cirrhosis- Patient has a cirrhosis due to hemachromatosis and alcohol complicated by hepatic encephalopathy.
EGD performed [**9-6**] showed 2 stage 1 varices and findings suggestive of Barrett's esophagus although no biopsies were taken.
He had 3 theraputic paracentesis during this admission, the last paracentesis was on [**9-14**] removing 4.5L.
# Hypotension- His hypotension was felt in the ICU to be most likely secondary to tense ascites.
Significant improvement of hypotension after therapeutic paracentesis (4L removed) on [**9-3**].
Given improvement of blood pressure following drop in intra-abdominal pressure, hypotension was most likely secondary to poor venous return due to intra-abdominal hypertension.
At OSH, he was stated on Zosyn for concerns for bacteremia and sepsis, but blood, urine, and peritoneal cultures from there as well as our own were negative, and he had already completed a 2 week course of antibitoics for MSSA bacteremia, therefore antibiotics were discontinued.
No fevers, chills or cough.
ABG showed moderate hypoxemia.
Likely due to tense ascites causing decreased volume of ventilation.
# MSSA bacteremia- Patient was origianlly treated with oxacillin at the OSH with a total 2 weeks of antibiotics.
Cultures from OSH and here were negative for bacteremia.
At this point hypotension seems most likely secondary to abdominal compartment syndrome.
# Anemia- Dropped as low as 22.5.
# Malnutrition- On admission the patient has a low albumin of 1.9, likely both secondary to liver disease and poor nutrition in setting of alcohol abuse.
# Depression- continued home zoloft.
Given trazodone 12.5mg po qhs prn insomina  # Access- patient had PICC line and HD line in place on admission.
He underwent mapping for a left arm AV fistula.

You were admitted because you had a bacterial infection in your blood and very low blood pressure requiring care in the ICU at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital.
Your liver failure, which is due to your alcoholism and hemachromatosis, led to fluid build up in your abdomen and the pressure caused worsening of your low blood pressure and difficulty breathing.
You had a endoscopy procedure which showed two stage one varices and mucosal dysplasia which needs to be followed up with another endoscopy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 42375**] in one year.
You also developed a fungal infection which was treated with Nystatin and resolved by discharge.
