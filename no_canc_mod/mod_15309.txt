She was brought to ED, where CT head and CTA head demonstrated subarachnoid hemorrhage and 2 right MCA aneurysms.
Mild nausea, no emesis.
No prior similar episodes.

Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basal cisterns and sylvian fissures bilaterally and in the right parietal lobe as described above.
5 mm x 7 mm sized multilobulated right MCA bifurcation aneurysm.
4 mm sized right M1 segment MCA aneurysm  [**2119-4-30**] angio Ms. [**Known firstname 1894**] [**Known lastname 51078**] underwent cerebral angiography and coil embolization of two aneurysms arising from the right middle cerebral artery, one from the right MCA bifurcation and a second aneurysm arising from the right M1 segment.
This was uneventful and there were no complications  [**2119-4-30**] CXR There is hyperinflation of the lungs and upper lobe predominant emphysema.
Diffuse predominantly mid and lower lobe interstitial lung opacities are present, representing either atypical/opportunistic infection (such as Pneumocystis), dependent distribution of interstitial edema or inflammatory airway disease mimicking interstitial lung disease.
There is no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
[**2119-4-30**] CXR Mild pulmonary edema has improved over the past 12 hours.
Small region of atelectasis persists at the base of the left lung, but obscures what may have nodule visible on [**2117-10-27**].
There was no evidence of vasospasm.
There was no evidence of vasospasm.
New subcentimeter low-attenuation focus in posterior right parietal subcortical white matter, suspicious for interval subacute infarction, perhaps embolic.
Interval clearing of the extensive diffuse subarachnoid blood, with no new hemorrhage, and no evidence of development of hydrocephalus.
Status post coiling of the the aneurysms at both the bifurcation and the M1 segment of the right MCA, with associated metallic artifact, limiting the evaluation of immediately-adjacent parenchyma  MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2119-5-7**] 1.
Small subacute infarct in posterior right parietal subcortical white matter with punctate focus (or foci) in the overlying cortex; these are likely embolic in nature.
No acute infarction elsewhere.
Status post recent coiling of two MCA aneurysms, with no evidence of new hemorrhage.
Baseline TCD's were performed on [**5-1**] and were negative for vasospasm.
She continued to have headache on [**5-3**] and prednisone was started.
She continued to have headache on [**5-5**] and TCD which showed velocities in the high end of normal range and no spasm.
She remained neurologically intact and was transferred to the floor.On [**5-6**], CTA head was done which was negative for vasospasm.
There was a question of a very small occipital infarct.
On [**5-7**], MRI head confirmed small subacute infarct in occipital region, but since patient remained stable on exam, no intervention is needed.
On [**5-8**], patient reported slight headache otherwise stable.
She was discharged home with no services.
**It was discovered during this admission that she does not have sarcoidosis althouth some recent OMR note mention this in the history.
She saw a pulmonologist for chronic mediastinal lymphadenopathy and elevated ACE levels.
Discharge Instructions: Ms. [**Known lastname 51078**] - You were admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] for subarachnoid hemorrhage after a right middle cerebral artery aneurysm rupture.
You make take Tylenol or prescribed pain medications for any post procedure pain or discomfort.
Your incision may be left uncovered, unless you have small amounts of drainage from the wound, then place a dry dressing or band aid over the area that is draining, as needed ??????
Slurring of speech or difficulty finding correct words to use ??????
Severe headache or worsening headache not controlled by pain medication ??????
A sudden change in the ability to move or use your arm or leg or the ability to feel your arm or leg ??????
Trouble swallowing, breathing, or talking ??????
Numbness, coldness or pain in lower extremities ??????
New or increased drainage from incision or white, yellow or green drainage from incisions ??????
Bleeding from groin puncture site  *SUDDEN, SEVERE BLEEDING OR SWELLING (Groin puncture site) Lie down, keep leg straight and have someone apply firm pressure to area for 10 minutes.
Please call your primary care physician within two weeks of discharge - a small pulmonary nodule was noted on chest xray that will require out patient follow up    Completed by:[**2119-5-9**
