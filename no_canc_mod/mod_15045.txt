HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 75-year-old white male with multiple medical problems who was admitted on [**2146-11-4**] from an outside hospital.
Patient was in his usual state of health until an acute onset of shortness of breath and respiratory distress.
The patient was admitted to an outside hospital with tachycardia, acidosis, hypoxia and hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 70s and a pH of 7.26.
He had an EKG which showed sinus tachycardia, but no evidence of acute ischemia.
An echocardiogram at the outside hospital showed an ejection fraction of 40% with anterior hypokinesis and akinesis.
He had a CT Scan angiogram which was negative for a pulmonary embolus, but did have a right lung effusion and consolidation.
During the transfer, the patient suffered from a PEA arrest and was resuscitated according to the PEA protocol.
Work up revealed cardiogenic versus septic shock.
This initial troponin leak was thought secondary to demand ischemia or a result of his cardiac arrest and resuscitation.
The patient had a PA catheter placed which was significant for an elevated cardiac output and a decreased systemic vascular resistant which was consistent with a septic picture rather than cardiogenic shock.
At that point, the patient was transferred to the MICU for treatment of a right lower lobe pneumonia and effusions.
The patient had a long .................. MICU course which was complicated by infection and difficult fluid balance.
The patient had thoracentesis to drain his pleural effusions and it was found they were consistent with a transudative pattern likely thought secondary to congestive heart failure.
Throughout his MICU course, the patient had difficulty being weaned from his ventilator.
He developed a new pneumonia and had sputum positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
In addition, the patient had a difficulty fluid status with hemodynamic instability secondary to his congestive heart failure and hypoalbuminemia.
His blood pressure persistently remained low after the multifactorial secondary to sepsis versus decreased albumin.
He was ruled out for adrenal insufficiency.
The patient was given Dopamine to help increase cardiac output and help increase his blood pressure, however he developed a second troponin leak and lateral ischemic changes so Dopamine was discontinued.
The patient was continued for treatment of his pneumonia and was started on Lasix in hope of mobilizing his third space fluid and increasing his cardiac output.
At the time of his transfer to the Medical Floor, the patient's main issues included continued diuresis for his persistent right sided transudative pleural effusion and continued mobilization of third space fluid in general.
CVA in [**2147-8-25**] embolic which left him with expressive aphasia.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
Non-Q wave MI in [**2146-9-25**].
Left carotid stenosis 80%, right carotid stenosis 50 to 60%.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general he was a pleasant, elderly male in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  He had moist mucous membranes.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Extremities:  He had 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.
Neuro exam:  Patient did not say anything, but nodded his head to questions.
Chest x-ray showed no interval changes.
ASSESSMENT:  This is a 75 [**Hospital **] nursing home resident with complicated recent medical history including CVA and a non-ST segment elevation MI within the past two months.
He was admitted on [**11-4**] with sepsis likely secondary to pneumonia complicated by bradycardia and PEA arrest upon transfer.
There was initial resolution of his pneumonia with continued hypotension secondary to infection, hypoalbuminemia, grossly positive fluid balance with right sided transudative pleural effusion status post two thoracentesis procedures, status post extubation now transferred from the MICU on [**2146-11-27**] to the floor.
PULMONARY:  Patient was status post extubation and was intubated for respiratory failure.
He had persistent transudative right sided pleural effusions.
Two thoracentesis revealed that this is transudative in nature and it was determined that continued thoracentesis would only result in reaccumulation of fluid.
We monitored his effusions via chest x-rays and oxygen saturations.
His oxygen requirement remained stable and chest x-ray revealed stability of his effusions.
Initially he had a troponin leak secondary to demand ischemia versus cardiac arrest resuscitation.
His second troponin leak was secondary to Dopamine to increase his cardiac output.
The patient had no symptoms of chest pain and was continued on aspirin therapy.
The patient still had a globally depressed akinesis and hypokinesis, however his overall function was improved.
He maintained his electrolytes with a potassium greater than 4 and magnesium greater than 2.
Hypotension:  The patient's hypotension was likely secondary to his depressed ejection fraction as well as his hypoalbuminemic state.
We continued to treat the patient with diuretics in hopes of mobilizing his third space fluid and to help the patient achieve a more desirable location on the ................. curve.
NEUROLOGY:  Patient has a history of CVA with subsequent expressive aphasia with right sided weakness.
Also has a history of a carotid stenosis status post sepsis with hypotension and status post PEA arrest which were all contributed to hypoxic brain injury.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient had a right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis that he had sustained a month back.
He completed a course of Levaquin and a 14 day course of Vancomycin for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive sputum and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in his catheter tip.
He also completed an 11 day course for Meropenem for Klebsiella urine infection.
A repeat urine culture when the patient was on the Medical Floor revealed no growth on his urine culture.
ENDOCRINE:  Patient had history of diabetes now on NPH 11 and 5 while his p.o.
FEN:  Patient had a speak and swallow evaluation and a modified barium swallow which revealed he can tolerate ground solids as well as nectar thick consistency liquids.
LINES:  Patient had a left PICC placed on [**2146-11-29**] given that he has poor access.
Congestive heart failure.
Urinary tract infection.
Note to rehab facility, the patient will need his heparin drip and Coumadin titrated to maintain INR between 2.0 and 3.0 for treatment of his right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
Patient can also receive Dextrose 50% solution if his glucose becomes low.
