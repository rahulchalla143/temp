A CTA was performed which showed a There is marked elevation of the left middle cerebral artery, including sylvian points A and B by the huge adjacent hemorrhage within the left temporal lobe.
Slight medial deviation of the proximal left posterior cerebral artery is presumably a consequence of the adjacent posterior hippocampal herniation.
There is a stellate-shaped collection of veins along the anteroinferior aspect of the left temporal hemorrhage.
The morphology and lack of obvious communication with visualized arterial structures would seem most consistent with the diagnosis of a developmental venous anomaly.
He was intubated at outside hospital he had a repeat CT here showing has shown progression of initial bleed - [**4-12**] large L temporal lobe bleed,with at least 1.5 cm midline shift to right, trapping of R lateral ventricle, with blood layering in the lateral ventricles bilaterally.
