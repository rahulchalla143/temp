Admission Date:  [**2118-4-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-5-2**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1631**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension at rehab.
History of Present Illness: This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo woman with history of stroke, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, CHF, COPD, Crohn's disease, and uterine cancer sent in from [**Hospital 100**] rehab for BP of 70/40, HR 65 (on digoxin), 92% on RA.
Per [**Hospital 100**] rehab, patient has had altered mental status and was being treated for COPD flare for one day with albuterol and atrovent q4 hours.
Hx of dementia and cognitive decline but unclear baseline.
Patient denies chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
She does have shortness of breath with a cough, though has been afebrile.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation without ST segment changes.
Atrial fibrillation off Coumadin.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which consist of emphysema.
History of resected left upper lobe pulmonary nodule.
History of basal cell carcinoma.
History of colonic polyps biopsied in [**2102**] 11.
-HCP= [**Name (NI) 8797**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 38917**] -lives at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab -100 PY tobacco hx -no EtOH/drugs   Family History: Family Hx: NC  Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 97.8 BP:85-97/43-52 P: 84 R: 22-25 O2: 98% General: Somnolent, A+Ox1 only, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear.
Neck: supple, unable to assess JVP, no LAD Lungs: Diminished breath sounds bilaterally.
No murmurs heard Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly.
Surgical scar present.
Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, or cyanosis.
1+ non pitting edema Neuro: L sided facial droop.
No evidence for congestive heart failure.
Previously described left lower lung field density obliterating diaphragmatic contour and presenting as retrocardiac density persists.
Presence of barium contrast, apparently used for an oropharyngeal video study earlier during the day, discloses sizable hiatal hernia which apparently contributions to this retrocardiac density.
Heart size has not changed and previously described general widening and elongation of thoracic aorta remains the same.
No new parenchymal infiltrates are seen.
Mild blunting of right lateral and posterior pleural sinus is present.
No pneumothorax identified.
Adjacent basilar lung opacification, probably atelectasis although aspiration pneumonia is not fully excluded.
Small pleural effusions with improvement on the right.
Brief Hospital Course: A [**Age over 90 **] yo woman history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, dementia, COPD, diastolic CHF now presenting with hypotension and hypoxia from rehab.
Potential other etiologies were adrenal insufficiency, cardiogenic shock secondary to decomensated CHF or MI, and less likely PE.
CXR showed left lower lobe infiltrate, concerning for pneumonia, along with SOB and cough.
In addition, she was started on IV Solumedrol and standing nebs for presumptive COPD flare and given small boluses of IV Lasix (when blood pressure came up) for possible component of decompensated CHF.
With the above interventions her blood pressure improved to 95-110s systolic, and her mental status improved.
She has completed a seven-day course of antibiotics at time of discharge; steroids were stopped prior to discharge and Lasix has been stopped due to concern of intravascular volume depletion based on labs.
# Altered mental status: She has mild dementia, likely compounded by hearing loss; per NH report she is alert and oriented to person, place and time at baseline.
Her electrolytes showed a mild hypernatremia, which corrected with IV D5W.
Her mental status gradually improved with treatment of infection and hypernatremia.
# Microcytic Anemia: Her baseline hematocrit is in the low 30s.
Given the hypotension at admission, there was concern that blood loss might be contributing.
There were no blood transfusions necessary.
# Acute renal failure: Her baseline creatinine is 0.9-1.1.
This was likely prerenal ARF in the setting of infection and sepsis, and it resolved with intravenous fluids.
# Lactic acidosis: Her initial lactate was 2.5 in ED, likely secondary to organ hypoperfusion.
There was no abdominal pain.
# Atrial fibrillation: She takes digoxin for rate control and is anticoagulated on coumadin.
# Diarrhea: She had loose bowel movements after transfer from the ICU in the setting of receiving broad spectrum antibiotics for health-care associated pneumonia.
First C dificile test was negative.
There is a second C dificile test pending.
Her symptoms may have been due to underlying Crohn's disease (in the setting of holding Asacol while she was in the ICU), and we have restarted Asacol prior to discharge.
# Urinary retention: On the day prior to discharge, she was noted to have post-void residual of 500 ccs after voiding 300ccs.
However, due to elevated PVR yesterday she was straight-cathed.
She is not on any anti-cholinergic meds or narcotics.
Her elevated PVR may be due to deconditioning.
