Rapid Respiratory Viral Antigen Test (Final [**2183-1-29**]):       Positive for Respiratory Syncytial viral antigen.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 58143**] is a 66 yo male with CHF, CAD, COPD, remote h/o lung cancer s/p left pneumonectomy presents with respiratory distress x 3 days- found to have a RSV respiratory infection and subsequently MRSA pneumonia.
#.MRSA Pneumonia/RSV - The patient presented with a new productive cough in the absence of clear pulmonary infiltrate.
He failed levofloxacin x 3 days at home as empiric treatment for community acquired pneumonia.
On admission he was found to have an elevated lactate, chills, and sputum production.
He was started on vanc/levo, but was found to have + RSV nasopharyngeal aspirate and antibiotics were DC initally discontinued, however on [**1-28**] sputum culutre was obatined and found to have MRSA.
He oxygen was weaned as tolerated and is currently afebrile and on his home rate of 2L NC.
#.COPD exacerbation - the patient has a long-standing history of COPD, admission exam consistent with a compenent of COPD exacerbation as a cause of dyspnea.
#.Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure - The patient has a history of severe systolic CHF s/p large anterior STEMI.
His lungs remained relatively clear of edema on CXR and on exam but he did have significant dyspnea on exertion indicative of left sided heart failure which improved with diuresis.
In addition he had very significant peripheral edema, with 3+ pedal edema to his upper thighs and also sacral edema, this also improved greatly with diuresis.
During his diuresis hyponatremia down to 118 and renal failure were limiting factors but these improved eventually with further diuresis and uptitration of milrinone.
He was continued on pseudoephedrine 30mg po q6hrs for BP augmentation and on spironolactone.
#.CAD - The patient was admitted from [**2182-11-14**] - [**2182-12-26**] with a large anterior STEMI.
He was found to have an LAD with a 70% stenosis after a proximal stent and then a total occlusion without collateral flow and stent was placed.
His hospital course was complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring balloon pump.
He has continued to be pressor dependent as above.
He improved to 1.4 with hydration, and believed to be likely prerenal in the setting of intravascular volume depletion, superimposed on mild chronic renal insufficiency.
#.DM2: On admission his glyburide held in the setting of acute illness.
