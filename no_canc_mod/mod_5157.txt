Admission Date:  [**2102-9-22**]     Discharge Date:  [**2102-10-9**]   Service:  C-MED  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure (on 3 liters of home oxygen) presenting with malaise, shortness of breath, and bilateral lower extremity edema for several days.
He has had multiple past admissions for cardiopulmonary problems.
Of note, he has a questionable history of a pulmonary embolism approximately one year ago and had been on Coumadin for this in the past.
Coronary artery disease; status post two myocardial infarctions.
Atrial arrhythmia, status post pacemaker.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (on 3 liters nasal cannula at home).
History of pulmonary embolism.
He has difficulty sleeping at night and must sleep at an angle secondary to his breathing problems.
ALLERGIES:  Allergies include CODEINE.
No recent ethanol use.
The patient was a well-appearing elderly male in no acute distress.
The lungs had emphysematous breath sounds with prolonged expiration with occasional anterior wheezing.
There were faint crackles at both bases.
No appreciable splenomegaly.
Extremities revealed 4+ pitting edema bilaterally to the midthigh.
Neurologic examination revealed cranial nerves II through XII were intact with no focal deficits.
Urinalysis on admission revealed a specific gravity of less than 1.005 with nitrites negative.
No red blood cells and no white blood cells.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray had cardiomegaly and was consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease changes.
There were no appreciable effusions.
The patient had right lower extremity Doppler studies which were negative.
Electrocardiogram with a dual-paced at a rate of 70 with no appreciable ischemic changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure presenting with malaise, shortness of breath, and increased lower extremity edema.
On physical examination, the patient had signs of right-sided heart failure including elevated jugular venous distention and extremity edema, as well as hepatic congestion.
It was felt, based on the patient's history, there was no clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so the patient had initially been started on heparin but this was discontinued early on in his hospital course.
The patient also had his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease medications continued.
The patient's symptoms improved with decreased edema; however, the patient still continued to have total volume body overload.
He had an episode of ventricular tachycardia which lasted approximately 30 seconds.
The patient was unresponsive during the run, but he awoke after the ventricular tachycardia broke.
The patient denied any further lightheadedness or dizziness after that.
The patient wished not to have a implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placed even given his risk for further tachycardic arrhythmic event, and this was discussed with the Electrophysiology Service.
The patient was aware of the fact that he may have a future arrhythmic event which may lead to early mortality.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15% to 20%.
Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction.
History of atrial arrhythmias; status post pacemaker.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
History of pulmonary embolism.
