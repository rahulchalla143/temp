Admission Date:  [**2120-1-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-1-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2054-8-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 15373**] Chief Complaint: Weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: .
Plasmapheresis .
History of Present Illness: 65 y/o female with 22 years of Multiple Sclerosis, severe, non ambulatory for 6-7 years, was admitted to [**Hospital6 1597**] because of increased weakness and decreased blood counts.
Over the past three years she has had multiple admissions for MS flares presenting with mental status changes, diffuse quadriparesis, hypotension, and fluctuating temperatures attributed to hypothalamic MS. She has responded to treatment with steroids in the past.
She also has chronic leukopenia, attributed to her Betaseron medication.
She presented to the [**Hospital3 **] ED hypothermia and was diagnosed with RLL pneumonia.
In the MICU at [**Hospital1 **] she was treated for RLLL pneumonia with ten days levofloxacin and ceftriaxone, course completed [**2120-1-7**].
Blood, urine, and CSF cultures showed no infection.
MRI showed stable disease without active flare.
Course also c/b runs of atrial flutter.
She was treated with steroids for MS and a pacemaker was placed for symptomatic bradycardia.
Her stay there was summerized above, and now she reports some difficulty with focusing her vision, as well as significant weakness of both her arms and legs.
She denies difficulty breathing, chest pain, headache, dysphagia, dysarthria, facial droop, parastheisas, or bladder or bowel incontinance.
She does report one episode of right leg numbness and coldness several days ago, which has resolved.
Multiple Sclerosis- sine [**2097**], severe, unable to walk for 6-7 years, wheelchair bound, no bladder/bowel incontinance, able to transfer herself to a wheelchair and stand at baseline, treated with avonex until several years ago, then betaseron since.
Trigeminal Neuralgia-left sided,well controlled with neurontin  Hypothyroidism- Thyroiditis, Diagnosed [**2093**] Osteoporsis S/P Tubal Ligation S/P Uterine Fibroidectomy S/P Pacemaker Placement [**12/2119**] .
Physical Exam: Mildy obese Caucaisan Female in no distress.
No carotid bruits.
Heart with 2/6 systolic murmur at RUSB.
Lungs with decreased breath sounds throughout due to poor respiratory effort.
Mild rhonchi at right base posteriorly.
No evidence of pneumonia is now present.
There is no failure.
IMPRESSION:  No active disease.
Noncontrast Head CT, [**2120-1-9**]: No intracranial hemorrhage.
Low attenuation periventricular white matter hypodensities most consistent with the patient's diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.
Diffuse patchy bilateral airspace disease, likely pneumonia with superimposed atelectasis.
No pulmonary embolism.
Enlarged main pulmonary artery suggesting pulmonary hypertension.
Mildly enlarged ascending aorta measuring 4 cm.
65 y/o female with progressive Multiple Sclerosis and extensive family history of autoimmune disease, who presented with decreased memory, bilateral lateral gaze nystagmus, upper extremity hypotonia, motor weakness of upper and lower extremities (much worse in lower extermities and proximally), decreased sensation to vibration in the toes, hyporeflexia (worse in the lower extremities), and bilateral upgoing toes.
Current weakness likely consistant with severe multiple sclerosis flare.
# Multiple sclerosis flare: The patient was admitted from an OSH for possible plasmapheresis for her MS exacerbation.
Given that the patient has had multiple exacerbations of her MS this year and given that her current MS flare did not appear to be responding to pulse solumedrol, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for possible plasmapheresis.
Because of concern for autonomic dysfunction, plasmapheresis was initially deferred given that plasmapheresis can cause fluid shifts and hypotension.
However, after the patient demonstrated stable blood pressures, it was decided to pursue plasmapheresis given the severity of the patient's weakness and lack of recovery of LE strength.
Plasmapheresis was stopped because of autonomic instability and because the patient did not show significant improvement.
# Hypotension, Autonomic Dysfuction: Patient with long history of autonomic instability [**1-12**] her multiple sclerosis which worsen during her MS exacerbations.
At [**Hospital3 **], the patient had a pacer placed for symptomatic bradycardia.
She was hemodynamically stable without hypotension or bradycardia.
The incision site was noted to have a small hematoma but otherwise clean and dry without evidence of infection.
Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], a chest xray showed no evidence of recurrent pneumonia.
She was afebrile during this admission and no further antibiotics were necessary.
The patient remained afebrile during this admission.
# Hypoxia: Patient was found to have persistent O2 requirement while in the MICU.
Primary: Multiple Sclerosis Exacerbation Autonomic Dysfunction, Hypotension Anemia .
Hemodynamically stable without hypotension or bradycardia.
Please call your doctor if you experience worsening weakness, decreased sensation, or confusion.
