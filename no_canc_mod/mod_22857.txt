Admission Date:  [**2176-9-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2176-11-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-8-25**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5129**] Chief Complaint: Transferred for angio  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: initiation of hemodialysis debridement of leg cellulitis Right lower extremity angiograms/ angioplasty of Right ant/post tib artery.
for DM, HTN, recent onset afib on coumadin, and PVD with chronic LE ulcers and cellulitis who was transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for angiogram of BLEs.
He had been admitted at [**Hospital1 1562**] on [**9-8**] with worsening LE ulcers and LE edema.
He had a 10 year history of bilateral LE ulcers with eschar on the R leg accompanied with pain worse wtih ambulation.
His course was complicated by ATN requiring 2 sessions of HD and afib with RVR s/p cardioversion on [**2176-9-23**] (and found to have elevated troponins) and initiation of amiodarone and coumadin.
No conjunctival pallor.
No scleral icterus.
MMM Neck: Supple, No LAD; unable to assess JVD given anasarca CARDIAC: irregularly irregular, S1 S2 systolic murmur LUNGS: bilateral rhonchi and transmitted upper airway sounds ABDOMEN: NABS.
No HSM EXTREMITIES: generalized anasarca; multiple full and partial thickness ulcerations extending from dorsum of right lower extremity to popliteal zone- currently wrapped in keflex bandage.
Left heel necrotic ulcer SKIN: generalized anasarca, scattered ecchymoses and petechia.
The patient is obese and therefore much of the widening is due to fat deposition but adenopathy could be present and the contour of the thoracic aorta is nearly entirely obscured.
There is no free subdiaphragmatic gas, and no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
CT Head [**2176-9-26**]- No acute intracranial process.
Bilateral pulmonary consolidations with small pleural effusions as above, possibly infectious given the provided history, though, given the distribution in this patient with a nasogastric tube as well as an endotracheal tube, aspiration is another consideration.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease involving the coronary arteries as well as the aorta.
Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 44 mm in greatest diameter.
ECHO [**2176-9-26**] - Moderately dilated left and right ventricles with normal left ventricular systolic function and mildly depressed right ventricular function.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
LENI ([**2176-10-2**])- IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
CT Head ([**2176-10-13**])- IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
ANKLE FILMS ([**2176-10-13**])- IMPRESSION: Bilateral extensive vascular calcifications.
Bilateral massive degenerative diseases in the region of the forefoot.
Bilateral soft tissue swelling at the medial aspect of the first and the lateral aspect of the fifth toe, with accompanying cortical defects, partly combined to sclerotic regions, suggesting either active or recurrent osteomyelitis.
Similar but less extensive lesions are seen in the distal parts of the first and fifth toe on the right and at the distal parts of the second and fourth toe on the right, as well as at the distal parts of the fourth toe on the left.
Markedly limited study, but no hydronephrosis or renal stone.
Echogenic renal parenchyma consistent with medical renal disease.
ECHO ([**2176-10-14**])- The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
Intrinsic function may be more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is trivial mitral regurgitation.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-9-26**], the left ventricular cavity size is smaller with mild global hypokinesis, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation is increased, and the rhythm is now sinus with ventricular bigeminy.
The severity of aortic stenosis and estimated PA systolic pressure are similar.
EKG ([**2176-10-20**])- Wide complex tachycardia suggestive of atrial tachycardia with frequent ventricular premature beats and underlying right bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2176-10-14**] there is no change.
Stable size of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, unchanged in size since the previous study.
Small right pleural effusion is likely, decreased since [**10-20**].
Mild-to-moderate bibasilar atelectasis stable.
No pneumothorax.
MRI Head ([**2176-11-2**])- IMPRESSION: No acute infarct seen.
Multiple small cortical infarcts are noted which appear subacute to chronic.
Limited post-gadolinium images demonstrate no obvious enhancement.
for DM, HTN, recent onset atrial fibrillation on coumadin, PVD with chronic LE ulcers and cellulitis who was transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for angiogram of bilateral lower extremities.
Upon hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**], patient rapidly developed symptoms of shock requiring transfer to the ICU.
He subsequently had a prolonged hospital course complicated by hospital aquired pneumonia, acute renal failure with trial of hemodialysis, persistent encephalopathy.
Eventually medical comorbidies were stabilized, allowing angiogram and subsequent angioplasty of right lower extremity on [**10-22**].
Multifactorial Shock: Soon after admission to [**Hospital1 18**], patient developed isolated hypotension requiring vasopressors despite no response in HR (though blocked by amiodarone and carvediol).
Etiology thought to be multifactorial from iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency (on chronic steriods) and septic shock secondary to hospital aquired pneumonia.
Only had TTE at OSH that showed no vegetations.
He is hypoxic and CXR with worsening infiltrates.
There may also have been a componenent of hypovolemia as had low urine output on arrival to the MICU as compared to previous days but likely due to ARF.
The patient was put on stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone) for adrenal insufficiency given history of chronic prednisone use.
Pt did have a brief pressor requirement.
Pt was briefly intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure from [**Date range (1) 49753**] and extubated without complication.
A CT scan of torso showed bilateral consolidations.
ECHO showed moderately dilated LV and RV, normal LV systolic function, mildly depressed RV function, mild AS, moderate PA systolic HTN.
Blood, stool and sputum cultures no growth.
Acute mental status changes: On admission, patient had progressive encephalopathy with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] consciousness and poor attention.
Initially, while the patient was in the intensive care unit, altered mental status was felt to be secondary to narcotic and sedative requirement.
All CNS- altering medication were stopped, residual delerium attributed to toxic metabolic syndrome with uremia, hyperammonemia, hypercapnia and hypernatremia.
Repeat head CTs ([**9-26**], [**10-13**]) through hospital course were negative for intracranial process and neurologic exam remained nonfocal throughout (although motor and sensory exam was limited by mental status).
Course was punctuated by several episodes of profound lethargy with hypercapnea (CO2 in 60s) secondary to hypoventilation.
These acute decompensations in mental status resolved with application of the patient's CPAP machine.
Chronic progression of encephalopathy corresponded to rising uremia from acute renal injury.
With reversal of metabolic abnormalities, patient's mental status improved significantly but he remained disoriented with severe short term memory deficits and evidence of frontal slowing.
Due to persistent mental status changes an MRI was pursued, showing multiple subacute and chronic cortical infarcts.
Peripheral Vacular Disease with chronic lower extremity ulcers:  Got Vanc/zosyn from [**Date range (1) 51011**], zosyn switched to clinda and cipro on [**9-30**].
Transfered from outside hospital for angiogram of bilateral lower extremities.
X-rays showed bony erosion from gouty tophi but no evidence of osteomyelitis.
On [**10-22**], once other medical problems had been stabilized, patient had CO2 angiogram with angioplasty of left anterior tibial artery.
Subsequently developed a wound infection in right dorsal ulcer, put on 1 week course of ciprofloxacin for wound culture growing serratia.
Likely repeat ATN after hypotensive episodes.
FeUrea 30% consistent with prerenal etiology.
At the same time, patient developed an erythematous rash, peripheral and urinary eosinophils.
Pancytopenia: According to primary care provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had progressive thrombocytopenia for the previous two years.
Extensive evaluation of thrombocytopenia was negative for other signs or symptoms of TTP, HIT, or DIC.
Peripheral smear with anisocytosis, burr cells and tear drop cells suggestive of myelodysplastic syndrome although diagnostic bone marrow biopsy not performed given acute illness.
There were no schistocytes on smear.
Initially, on transfer to the floor, the patient had a slow GI bleed with guiac positive stools.
He was initially placed on omeprazole [**Hospital1 **] for stress ulcer prophylaxis in the setting of chronic steriod use, but this was transitioned to ranitidine secondary to concern for acute interstitial nephritis (see below).
By time of discharge, no further evidence of active bleed.
Atial Fibrillation: Transferred from outside hospital with new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation s/p cardioversion on coumadin.
Hypothermia:  On [**2176-10-11**] patient developed hypothermia with minimum temperature of 91.
Etiology unclear, although maintained high suspicion for sepsis given pancytopenia.
Most likely source remained leg ulcers, especially given evidence of active/ recurrent osteomyelitis on x-ray.
no evidence of active flare  9.
