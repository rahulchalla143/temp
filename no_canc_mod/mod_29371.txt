Admission Date:  [**2143-3-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2143-3-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2068-4-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: 74yo man with h/o CAD, DM2, A fib, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and recent episode of bronchitis presented with two days of worsening dyspnea.
He initially presented to [**Location (un) 620**] with complaints of shortness of breath for two days.
He reports that he does not have dyspnea at his baseline; normally, he can climb a flight of stairs and walks his dog daily without any chest pain or shortness of breath.
Two days prior to admission, he was raking leaves in his yard with his hands, and afterward he experienced continued shortness of breath at both rest and worsened with exertion, which persisted for two days.
At [**Location (un) 620**], evaluation notable for elevated d-dimer, elevated troponin at 0.153 (0.00 - 0.01), and elevated BNP at 4133.
Right heart catheterization revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures (RVEDP = 14 mmhg, mean PCWP 25 mmhg with prominent v waves).
There was no evidence for pulmonary hypertension.
CAD - no documentation for this available; I discussed his history with his Cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 44655**].
ekg changes c/w ischemia .
inferior basal ischemia on echo - this was a small area and unchanged compared to prior in '[**37**].
- cath records not available; by report, "only mild disease"; has never had stents or CABG done.
Atrial fibrillation; failed cardioversion in past 3.

Insulin requiring DM2 5. depression 6. hyperlipidemia 7. inguinal hernias 8. kidney stones 9. s/p bronchitis about three weeks ago 10. reports h/o allergic symptoms, dyspnea, cough with previous exposure to leaves.
gen a/o, mildly dyspneic heent dry mucous membranes neck JVP 10cm cv irregularly irregular; no m/r/g resp bibasilar crackles abd obese, soft, nt, nd extr trace bilateral edema with stasis pigmentation changes.
no calf tenderness or asymmetric findings.
Pertinent Results: ECG [**Location (un) 620**]: atrial fibrillation, 76bpm, likely old anterior wall MI with Q waves in anterior precordial leads.
Non-specific ST/T  wave changes in lateral precordial leads V4-6 (no old EKG for comparison) .
Mild congestive heart failure.
Ill-defined retrocardiac density.
Follow up PA and lateral chest radiograph after resolution of pulmonary edema is recommended to further assess for resolution and to exclude a neoplastic nodule in this area.
CTA chest: IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2) Congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Follow-up is recommended after treatment of congestive heart failure.
ECHO: Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include mid to distal anterior septal/anterior akinesis and apical akinesis dyskinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system revealed severe native three vessel coronary artery disease.
The left anterior descending is diffusely diseased.
There is a 90% ostial LAD stenosis.
There is an 80% distal - apical LAD stenosis.
There is a significant ramus branch with a 80% ostial stenosis.
There is a 70% tubular stenosis of the LCX.
The right coronary artery is non-dominant and is diffusely diseased.
Right heart catheterization revealed elevated right and left sided filling pressures (RVEDP = 14 mmhg, mean PCWP 25 mmhg with prominent v waves).
There was no evidence for pulmonary hypertension.
Left heart cathererization did not reveal evidence of systemic hypotension.
IMPRESSION: Moderate plaque with a left 40-59% carotid stenosis.
CT CHEST: FINAL REPORT   INDICATION: Right sided chest pain and congestive heart failure.
Chest radiographs of the same day are available for correlation.
CHEST CT ANGIOGRAM: There are no filling defects in the pulmonary vasculature to suggest pulmonary embolism.
The heart and aorta appear unremarkable.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are present.
There are bilateral ground glass opacities, predominantly in the lower lobes, compatible with pulmonary edema.
There is a 14 mm segmental lymph node in the right lower lobe and an 11 mm right interlobar lymph node.
Subcentimeter paratracheal and left periaortic lymph nodes are also present.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic bone lesions are identified.
IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2) Congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural effusions.
Follow-up is recommended after treatment of congestive heart failure.
Brief Hospital Course: IMPRESSION/PLAN: 74yo man with h/o DM2, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, CAD admitted with fatigue and shortness of breath worsening over the past few weeks.
He was found to have three vessel disease during catheterization, with evidence of increased filling pressures and decreased cardiac output / index.
NSTEMI: Patient had evidence of an non ST-elevation myocardial infarction with elevated cardiac enzymes, dynamic ECG changes, and severe three vessel disease seen at catheterization.
He was a candidate for surgery, but needed optimization of his respiratory status, renal insufficiency, and infectious issues prior to surgery.
He had continued to have intermittent rises in his cardiac enzymes while awaiting surgery, presumably from demand / ongoing ischemia.
He had an episode the night prior to surgery where he became bradycardic and hypotensive, that lead to a code blue.
Exacerbatoin recently likely due to ischemia.
At cath, he had poor CI/CO, and was started on dobutamine.
His oxygenation did not improve drastically, and it was considered that much of his hypoxia was due to an infectious process / mulit-lobular pneumonia since it was not improving and he had a persistent leukocytosis.
It was subsequently determined that, since he did not really improve with the antibiotics, and his WBC remained elevated without any fever, that most of his hypoxia was due to ongoing ishemia and congestive failure.
He remained in atrial fibrillation.
