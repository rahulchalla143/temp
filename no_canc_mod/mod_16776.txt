Admission Date:  [**2161-8-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2161-9-11**]  Date of Birth:   [**2083-5-10**]     Sex:  M  Service:  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old male with a past medical history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, who was in his usual state of health when he developed nausea and vomiting x5 with bright red blood.
He went to [**Hospital6 33**], had nasogastric tube placed with bright red blood and melena, and developed rapid atrial fibrillation.
He had an EGD with varices noted, but no active bleeding.
Is also noted to have a portal gastropathy.
A repeat EGD showed active variceal bleeding.
He had hypotension as low as systolic blood pressure of 60 and again started having bright red blood per rectum.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for evaluation and possible transcutaneous intraperitoneal shunt.
On arrival, the patient was without complaint.
He denied lightheadedness, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.
The unit was stopped and sent for transfusion reaction work up.
Congestive heart failure for which he had been hospitalized years ago.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Question of scarring in the liver with no followup.
He has edematous icteric sclerae.
Lungs had bibasilar crackles.
Abdomen had decreased bowel sounds, it was distended, but soft without evidence of ascites.
There was no evidence of chronic venous stasis changes.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of [**Street Address(2) 52288**] depressions of 1.5 to 1 mm in leads V2 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE WAS SIGNIFICANT FOR THE FOLLOWING ISSUES:  An OG tube was placed and lavage showed fresh blood.
It was decided that the patient be electively intubated for airway protection and [**Last Name (un) **] tube was placed in the esophagus in order to correct hemostasis of esophageal varices.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: GI:  Patient continued to have bright red blood.
A repeat EGD with banding of several more esophageal varices which were oozing.
The patient had no more episodes of active bleeding from his varices throughout the duration of his hospitalization.
The patient had multiple paracenteses with drainage of 2.4 liters of yellow-red fluid on [**8-27**].6 liters of serosanguinous fluid on the 11th, and 1.7 liters on the 12th.
Cardiac:  On arrival, the patient was in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, and was noted to be hypotensive.
He received multiple blood transfusions and fluid boluses.
Patient was started on Natrecor on the 11th, and noted to have a decreased blood pressure, which responded to boluses and decreasing sedation medications.
He was started on dobutamine, Lasix, and digoxin for rate control and for inotropic effect.
He continued in atrial fibrillation for the duration of his hospitalization.
He continued to be pressor dependent for the next few days and received large volumes of fluid.
Infectious disease:  Urinalysis shortly after admission showed the patient had a urinary tract infection and a culture positive for proteus.
Multiple cultures of the blood, sputum, and peritoneal fluid were negative for organisms and there were no malignant cells in the peritoneal fluid.
Two to three days before his death the patient was noted to have a sputum culture positive for Staphylococcus aureus and ultimately bacteremia with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which continued to persist despite Vancomycin treatment until the patient's death on [**9-11**].
While the patient developed Staphylococcus aureus in his sputum, it appeared unlikely that he would be extubated within the following few days.
Renal:  Upon admission, the patient noted to have acute renal failure due to prerenal azotemia, which improved with correction of his intravascular volume depletion.
This was thought to be likely secondary to aggressive diuresis versus early sepsis.
Diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome was entertained, but thought not to be present and for other reasons for his acute renal failure.
The patient had several central lines placed during the course of hospitalization including a right internal jugular line which was used for the TIPS procedure.
Atrial fibrillation.
Acute renal failure.
