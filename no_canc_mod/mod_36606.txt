The husband states that the wife was vomiting this morning, "too numerous to count", complained of a headache.
A head ct was done and revealed blood in the ventricular system with an entraped left lateral ventricle and subsequent hydrocephalus.

Left middle cerebral artery duplication.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2127-5-3**] 9:46 PM IMPRESSION: Acute hydrocephalus with multiple foci of blood within the bilateral lateral ventricles, cerebral aqueduct, and fourth ventricle with ventricular catheter placed within the left lateral ventricle.
Hypodensity within the periventricular white matter may represent transependymal flow of CSF versus chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2127-5-4**] 7:54 AM IMPRESSION:  Minimal if any decrease in ventricular size.
A small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage is now evident.
Brief Hospital Course: The pt was admitted to the ICU with a 5x6 mm ACOM aneurysm rupture and obstructive hydrocephalus, so an emergent EVD shunt was placed.
The pt's neurologic exam never improved from her initial presentation despite shunt placement, and a cerebral angiogram revealed a minimum of 7 more aneuyrsms, at least one of which (ACOMM) was not amenable to coiling or clipping.
