Admission Date:  [**2129-10-30**]     Discharge Date:  [**2129-11-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2087-5-28**]     Sex:  M  Service:  TRANSPLANT HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 42-year-old male who had a longstanding history of type 1 diabetes with a history of a kidney transplant in [**2126-10-10**].
At the time of admission he denied any recent illnesses or symptomatology of shortness of breath or chest pain.
Type 1 diabetes times 32 years.
Status post right cadaveric kidney transplant in [**2126**] with previous end-stage renal disease.
His preoperative workup had consisted of a stress test approximately two months prior to admission which was negative.
There were no complications.
During the remainder of his hospital course, he did quite well clinically and was ambulating without very much abdominal pain by postoperative day number two.
This was presumed to be secondary to his steroids and mild amount of graft pancreatitis.
While it was presumed that this elevation was secondary to both his sugar load that he had just received along with the steroids, he was taking that evening for a graft ultrasound.
Ultrasound showed no evidence of any compromise flow to the graft, and no evidence of any peri-graft fluid collection.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Good with a well-functioning pancreatic graft.
