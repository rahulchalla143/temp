Patient had a WBC count of 16.4 and a UA with moderate Leuks and >50WBC's.
CXR was significant for mild pulmonary edema and a proBNP>[**Numeric Identifier **].
Patient was given 750mg Levaquin, 1g Vancomycin, 500mg Meropenem for antibiotics in additional to tylenol for fever and dilaudid for pain.
The patient was transferred to the ICU for further work-up and treatment of severe sepsis.

Rheumatoid arthritis.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Neurogenic bladder.
Dementia Status post total hip replacement in [**2116**].
Diverticulosis and diverticulitis   Social History: Has lived at [**Hospital **] nursing home x several years.
Is bedbound and needs assistance w/ ADLs like eating/dressing/toileting because of her contractures and pain.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: VS: Temp: 99 BP: 128/69 HR: 125 RR: 31 O2sat: 98% on 4L NC GEN: uncomfortable, moaning 'help' HEENT: R>L pupil, EOMI, anicteric, MM dry, arcus senilus NECK: no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd RESP: coarse breath sounds bilateral, tachypneic CV: difficult to appreciate [**2-6**] loud, coarse breath sounds ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt EXT: L AKA, RLE warm, well perfused SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice NEURO: Alert and oriented to place   Pertinent Results: [**12-21**] - CXR - IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %) with apical akinesis/hypokinesis.
Cannot exclude apical thrombus (apical views are technically suboptimal).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: [**Age over 90 **]yo F with MMP who presents with dyspnea, fever and altered mental status found to have urosepsis.
# Severe Sepsis - WBC 16.4, T 102, Tachypnea to 40., lactate 2.8, abrupt alteration in mental status.
Chronic Klebsiella UTI with UA significan t for >50 WBCs and moderate leukocyte esterase.
Pt received gentle IVFs in setting of radiographic evidence of mild pulmonary edema and BNP>70,000 suggestive of CHF.
Patient remained fluid responsive throughout the first hours of admission and then became progressively tachycardic and tachypnic.
The patient died at 5:10am on [**2128-12-23**] from respiratory failure secondary to urosepsis and congestive heart failure.
# CHF/Respiratory Failure - BNP>70,000 and mild pulmonary edema on CXR, MI v troponin leak in setting of tachycardia.
Clinically dry, no elev JVP, however, lung sounds were very coarse.
# Tachycardia - likely secondary to respiratory effort v pain.
Patient then developed AFIB w/ rapid ventricular rate with intermittent episodes of hypotension requiring the use of IV lopressor and digoxin to obtain rate control.
# F/E/N: Puree foods, gravy thick.
# PPx: Bowel regimen, PPI, sq Heparin  # Access: PIVs  # Code Status: DNR/DNI, it was discussed with patient's health care proxy the grave nature of her sepsis and impending respiratory failure.
