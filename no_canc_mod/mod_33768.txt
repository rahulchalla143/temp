**FINAL REPORT [**2180-11-18**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2180-11-18**]):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
**FINAL REPORT [**2180-11-21**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2180-11-21**]):    NO GROWTH.
FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
----------- Blood cultures from [**11-14**], [**11-16**], [**11-17**], [**11-19**], 10/20,[**11-22**] no growth to date ------------  DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:  CT HEAD [**2180-11-14**]: Hyperdense lesion within the right lateral ventricle likely represents an intraventricular mass, with associated hemorrhage, though further evaluation with MRI with gadolinium is recommended.
PELVIS CT [**2180-11-14**]: IMPRESSION: No acute fracture.
Please note, the examination is limited secondary to osteopenia.
Diffuse osteopenia, which may limit the sensitivity for detection of nondisplaced fractures.
Mild degenerative changes including grade 1 anterolisthesis at the L4-5 level and loss of intervertebral disc space height at the L5-S1 level.
Significant canal stenosis at the L4-5 level.
CXR [**2180-11-14**]: PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The heart is mildly enlarged.
No large pleural effusions or pneumothorax is demonstrated.
There may be mild scarring within the posterior costophrenic angles.
Degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**2180-11-16**]: he left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: no definite vegetations seen  XRAY Bilateral Feet [**2180-11-16**]: Marked arthropathy involving the bilateral feet as described.
Diagnostic considerations include neurogenic osteoarthropathy (Charcot).
The sequela of chronic infection can have a similar appearance.
BONE SCAN [**2180-11-17**]: IMPRESSION: Positive three-phase bone scan in the hind and mid feet bilaterally with more focal area of increased uptake in the left midfoot.
The findings likely reflect Charcot Arthropathy, although an underlying infection cannot be excluded.
There is mild-to-moderate prominence of temporal horns indicating early communicating hydrocephalus.
Following contrast administration, no abnormal enhancement is identified.
Persistent mild prominence of temporal horns indicating early communicating hydrocephalus.
No abnormal enhancement is seen surrounding the region of hematoma.
WHITE BLOOD CELL STUDY [**2180-11-20**]:IMPRESSION: Increased tracer uptake in both feet is a non-specific finding, probably related to chronic inflammation due to extensive neuropathic changes; however, a component of bilateral osteomyelitis cannot be excluded with these findings.
CXR [**2180-11-22**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-19**], there is little change.
Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists without vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
Specifically no evidence of acute pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 81 year old female with history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, charcot feet, who initially presented with a fall and was found to have and intraventricular hemorrage.
1)Intraventricular Hemorrhage: Intraventricular hemorrhage felt by neurosurgery to likely be secondary to trauma.
Pt was brought to outside hospital for evaluation after having multiple falls at home and was found by head CT to have an intraventricular hemorrhage for which she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
Head CT did not show evidence of fracture, nor did L spine films.
However, this initial head CT was concerning for intraventricular mass, with associated hemorrhage.
MRI could not be obtained to clarify this question of a mass so CT Head with contrast performed and showed right-sided intraventricular hematoma without any abnormal enhancement surrounding hematoma.
Patient remained hemodynamically stable.
Patient not noted to have any motor or sensory deficits attributable to the hemorrhage.
Part of her confusion/disorientation could certainly be attributed to her intraventricular hemorrhage versus delirium from her infections.
Patient found to have urinary tract infection positive for E.Coli on [**11-14**] that was treated with a course of nitrofurantoin.
Fevers continued in spite of UTI being treated.
Infectious disease team was consulted and felt that intraventricular blood was most likely cause of fever, though UTI and osteomyelitis were also considered.
Patient has had recent MSSA bacteremias secondary to osteomyelitis of right foot.
An extensive work-up for potential osteomyelitis was initiated.
Patient's underlying charcot feet made differentiating osteomyelitis from her underlying inflammation very difficult.
But given normal white cell count and no positive blood cultures suspicion for osteomyelitis remained low.
On [**11-22**] patient found to have clostridium dificile and was symptomatic with diarrhea.
It is possible cdiff colitis could have contributed to the fevers.
Patient was started on Flagyl 500mg PO TID for this infection (day 1 of 14 day course [**11-22**]) At time of discharge patient had been afebrile for 48 hours and continued to have a normal WBC count.
Likely hyponatremia secondary to patient's interventricular hemorrhage.
Would suggest continued fluid restriction, but increase fluids to 1500ml/day and monitoring serum sodium until intraventricular hemorrhage resolves.
5)Anemia: Likely represents anemia of chronic disease, which is supported by iron studies during this hospitalization.
7) Type II Diabetes Mellitus: Blood sugars remained stable.
9)Right gluteal ulcer/Left gluteal ecchymosis: Patient seen by wound care nurse who recommended  atmos air mattress, repositioning every 1-2 hours, waffle boots for charcot feet, elevating legs, sitting on chairs for now more than 1.5 hours with pressure relief cushion in place.
13) Gastroesophageal reflux disease: Patient was continued on omeprazole 20 mg daily.
Lantus 8 units at bedtime Humalog 4 units before dinner Tylenol Extra Strength 500 mg Tab Oral [**2-2**] Tablet(s) Every 4-6 hrs PRN   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1293**] - [**Location (un) 1294**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Traumatic Intraventricular hemorrhage Delirium Urinary tract infection Clostridium dificle colitis Hyponatremia/SIADH Decubitus Ulcer  Secondary: Diabetes mellitus type II Rheumatoid arthritis - chronic steroids Anemia of chronic disease Bilateral Charcot foot Diabetic neuropathy Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Prior osteomyelitis, right foot MSSA bacteremia Hypothyroidism GERD Total knee replacement   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to this hospital to manage bleeding in your head.
This blood did not result in any neurologic changes on examination.
We think that your bleed was likely due to falling.
During your hospitalization you were found to have fevers multiple days in a row.
You were found to have an infection in your urine that we treated with antibiotics.
You also had an infection in your bowel that caused you to have diarrhea, which we also treated with antibiotics.
At the time you were discharged you had been without fever for over 48 hours.
Your Seroquel was STOPPED becuase you were having some confusion and we did not want to further alter your mental status.
If you experience a recurrence of fevers, or have chills, night sweats, chest pain , shortness of breath, or increasing weakness please call your primary care provider or come to the emergency department for evaluation.
