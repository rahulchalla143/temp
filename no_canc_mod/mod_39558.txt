Admission Date:  [**2136-5-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2136-5-14**]  Date of Birth:   [**2083-8-31**]       Sex:  F  Service:  NEUROLOGY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52 year old right handed woman with a past history significant for fibromyalgia, asthma, and chiropractic manipulation in the week prior to presentation.
She was in her usual state of health until approximately 4:00 p.m. on the day of admission when she had a sudden onset of speech problems and right sided arm and leg weakness causing her to be unable to stand.
The magnetic resonance scan showed mild diffusion hyperintensity in the deep white matter on the left in the region of the internal capsule and periventricularly.
MRA showed left internal carotid artery/middle cerebral artery occlusion.
Her vascular risk factors are negative including no history of smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, cardiac history or diabetes mellitus.
There is no history of clotting problems in her or in her family.
She does have headaches associated with her fibromyalgia but no history of migraine headaches.
Pyridium which causes nausea and vomiting.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has no history of smoking.
In general, the patient was awake and alert in no acute distress.
Head was normocephalic and atraumatic  The neck was supple with no carotid bruits.
The abdomen was soft and nontender, nondistended.
Extremities were without edema and without evidence of thrombosis.
Neurologic - The patient was awake and alert with nonfluent speech with only occasional verbal utterances and no clear words.
There was a right upper motor neuron facial palsy.
There was very minimal spontaneous movement at the right arm and right leg.
On sensory examination, she withdraws to noxious stimuli in all four extremities with less rapid response at the right arm and leg as compared to the left.
RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  On admission as above included magnetic resonance scan which showed the subtle area of restricted effusion within the left corona radiata and absence of flow within the visualized intracranial portion of the left internal carotid artery and left middle cerebral artery on MRA.
The vertebral basilar system and right internal carotid artery were patent.
On the morning after admission, the patient's neurologic examination was significantly improved with increased verbal output but with slow and effort speech as well as grammatical and paraphasic errors.
MRA of the neck was done to evaluate for carotid dissection.
This showed left internal carotid artery occluded nearly at its origin.
Repeat magnetic resonance scan of the brain showed large left basal ganglia infarct involving the head of the left caudate nucleus, anterior limb of the left internal capsule as well as the left lentiform nucleus.
There was no evidence of hemorrhage seen.
This showed no atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There was no cardiac source of embolus seen.
The patient's neurologic status continued to improve with continuing improvement of her aphasia and her right sided weakness.
At the time of her discharge, her neurologic examination was significant for a transcortical motor aphasia with normal repetition, normal comprehension and fluent speech though with significant difficulties with naming.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Status post left internal carotid artery/middle cerebral artery occlusion secondary to carotid dissection with transcortical motor aphasia and right hemiparesis.
