# GI Bleed/Acute blood loss anemia: Given the recent manipulation, the duodenal adenoma site was felt to be the most likely site of bleeding.
The findings were as follows: normal mucosa in esophagus and stomach, visible vessels noted in the base of ulceration from previous resection --> three endoclips were successfully applied for the purpose of hemostasis, and no fresh or altered blood in upper GI tract.
He passed a melenotic stool while in the ICU and was monitored for transition back to brown stools.
Presyncope: His symptoms were likely positional, in the setting of bloody BMs.
Likely orthostatic vs vasovagal etiology.
EKG showed S1Q3T3, but no tachycardia or O2 requirement, leaving low suspicion for PE.
He was volume repleted with 3L IVF prior to arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] and received 1 more liter bolus in the ICU.
Fever: Likely from translocation of bacteria at site of GI bleed.
