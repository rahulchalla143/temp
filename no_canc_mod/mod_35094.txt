Admission Date:  [**2201-3-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2201-3-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2139-4-7**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Vancomycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4854**] Chief Complaint: Weakness, [**First Name3 (LF) 7186**] of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: 61 y/o male with history of Wegener's granulomatosis and autoimmune lymphopenia, on immunosuppression complicated by multiple infections as detailed in HPI below presents with weakness and [**First Name3 (LF) 7186**] of breath.
He has complained of dizziness and headaches but this has thought to be related to his antihypertension medications.
Most recently he has not had any evidence of active pulmonary vasculitis and stable emphysema.
Today he developed lethargy and was brought to the ED by his nephew.
[**Name (NI) **] was noted to be hypotensive with SBP 78 and tachycardic and was started on an NRB.
Multiple new small nodules, many of which are cavitating, within the right lung, which may be consistent with patient's known Wegener's granulomatosis.
Extensive consolidation in the left lower lobe, consistent with pneumonia.
Limited examination for mesenteric ischemia; however, there is loss of normal haustra and mild bowel wall thickening of the colonic wall starting from the hepatic flexure extending to the proximal descending colon.
Ischemia is thought to be less likely due to the distribution of the abnormality, spanning different vascular territories.

ST-T wave abnormalities are non-specific.
Since the previous tracing of [**2200-11-26**] ventricular rate is faster and further ST-T wave changes are present.
[**2201-3-14**] CXR: UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Dense consolidation within the left lung base is concerning for pneumonia.
There is likely a small left effusion.
Focal ill-defined patchy and nodular opacities within the right upper lobe appear similar to the prior study.
Relative lucency of the lung apices reflects underlying emphysema.
There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: New consolidation in left lung base concerning for pneumonia.
Multiple new small nodules, many of which are cavitating, within the right lung, which may be consistent with patient's known Wegener's granulomatosis.
Extensive consolidation in the left lower lobe, consistent with pneumonia.
Limited examination for mesenteric ischemia; however, there is loss of normal haustra and mild bowel wall thickening of the colonic wall starting from the hepatic flexure extending to the proximal descending colon.
Ischemia is thought to be less likely due to the distribution of the abnormality, spanning different vascular territories.
Avascular necrosis of the right femoral head.
[**2201-3-16**] Abdominal x-ray: IMPRESSION: A solitary overhead view of the abdomen excludes the lower pelvis.
As far as one can tell with the patient in this position, there is no appreciable distention of the GI tract, with the exception of the stomach which is fluid filled, despite a nasogastric tube in place.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
Sinus disease as above.
This is more likely due to hemorrhage.
Otherwise there are no changes in the right lobe with pleural parenchyma scarring in the right apex.
Areas of increased opacification persist in the lower half of the left hemithorax.
This could be due to pulmonary hemorrhage or superimposed pneumonia.
Apical pleural changes are again seen.
[**2201-3-18**] RUQ ultrasound with Doppler: FINDINGS: Extremely limited views of the liver demonstrate no focal or textural abnormality.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
The gallbladder is normal without evidence of stones.
There is no evidence of splenomegaly with spleen measuring up to 9.9 cm.
No appreciable ascites.
Limited study with no gross abnormalities of the liver.
Unchanged extent of the predominantly left basal parenchymal opacities, combined to some degree of retrocardiac atelectasis.
Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without evidence of pulmonary edema.
No newly occurred opacities.
The presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
Worsening of pulmonary abnormalities in right lower lobe and left upper lobe but improvement in left lower lobe.
Findings consistent with bleeding in the internal adductor muscles of the left hip.
[**2201-3-20**] CXR: Bibasilar consolidation, left greater than right, worsened since [**3-17**], stable since [**3-19**], consistent with bilateral pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration, alternatively pulmonary hemorrhage.
Left lung base is excluded from the examination, probable small persistent left pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
The pre-existing bilateral apical and bilateral basal opacities that are slightly more severe on the left than on the right, have mildly improved.
New parenchymal opacities are not seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 y/o male with a history of Wegener's granulomatosis admitted with respiratory failure thought to be due to pneumonia.
The suspicion was highest that he developed respiratory failure due to pneumonia in a patient with emphysema and [**Month/Day/Year **] lung damage from repeated infections and Wegener's granulomatosis.
His hospital course was complicated by sepsis requiring multiple vasopressors, oliguric renal failure with hyperkalemia, acidosis, and volume overload requiring CVVH, lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, atrial tachyarrhythmia, ileus, and anemia with CT scan showing internal adductor muscle bleed.
Regarding his DVT, given his bleeding and evidence of coagulopathy he underwent a temporary IVC filter placement by interventional radiology.
Multiple services were consulted including the infectious disease team regarding management of his pulmonary infection, the renal service for management of oliguric renal failure, and rheumatology given his Wegener's disease.
Despite out combined efforts, his respiratory status declined as he developed an increasing FiO2 requirement with agonal breathing, also with worsening hemodynamic status and acidemia, and deterioration in his neurological status.
