Admission Date:  [**2132-7-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-8-17**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: infected PEG tube  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2132-7-30**] - laparotomy and open debridement of L abdominal abscess and necrotizing fasciitis with new gastrostomy tube placement  History of Present Illness: 89 yo female with pmhx sig for a-fib, aortic stenosis, recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**Month (only) **] for SDH, s/p evacuation.
She was discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**2132-7-19**] but remained vent-dependent with recurrent high fevers.
Per records from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, her TFs had been held secondary to an ileus which resolved with an aggressive bowel regimen.
Currently she is responsive to voice, able to follow commands and answer questions; denies pain but heavily grimaces with palpation of her abdomen.
Prior to that she was living alone, daughter lives in [**Name (NI) 3844**]        Family History:  Mother died at the age of 70 from lung cancer .
Physical Exam: GEN: elderly female, lying semi-upright, alert, repsonsive, NAD HEENT: + alopecia, + temporal wasting, anicteric sclera, PERRLA, EOMI, dry mucosa, thick whitish yellow coating on tongue, OP clear NECK: no LAD, trach site appears clean, in proper place CV: regular rhythm, normal rate, 3/6 systolic murmur best at right sternal border, radiates to carotids LUNGS: decreased at bases, prolonged exp phase, no accessory muscle use ABD: mildly distended, soft, diffusely tender to palpation, hypoactive BS.
Stage I ulcer on buttock, DP pulses faint B/L.
[**7-29**] G tube check: multiple small amounts of extravasation into skin, but not intraabdominally.
evidence of free air in peritoneum c/w manipulation of PEG.
[**7-29**] I+O- CT abd/pelvis: prelim report shows evidence of 9cmx3cm abscess extending from g-tube into pelvis .
[**2132-7-31**] L subclavian central line placed without complication .
[**2132-8-5**] RUE doppler US: neg for DVT .
no acute IC bleed  Brief Hospital Course: 89 yo female with recent SDH s/p evacuation with complicated course including intubation, VAP; and eventual trach and PEG placement.
Pt readmitted from rehab for recurrent fevers, found to have infected PEG tube with necrotizing fasciitis, now with afib and RVR.
# A-fib - H/o of A fib during prior admission, on [**8-3**] in afib with RVR up to 130's-140s.
Increased sympathetic drive in setting of hypotension may have contributed to elevated HR.
Pt tried on esmolol drip for rate control on [**8-6**] which failed secondary to poor rate control and decrease in SBPs to 80s.
There was poor rate control on diltiazem drip (110s-150s) and we were unable to increase diltiazim drip rate per decreasing SBPs.
#) hypotension - pt had decreased UOP since admission.
There was evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR and much peripheral edema on exam without evidence of oxygen desaturation.
She was losing a significant amount of fluid from her wound and so I/O recordings were not accurate assessment of her fluid status.
Pt was aggressivley hydrated with good response to  UOP and CVP at target (19-20); however, aggressive hydration was held per increased pulmonary edema on CXR with increasing FiO2 requirement.
Pt intermittently became hypotensive and pressor dependent due to volume depletion and/ or RVR.
# Respiratory [**Name (NI) 37370**] pt initially with hypoxemic respiratory failure thought to be secondary to pulmonary edema from severe aortic stenosis, but also with VAP.
[**2132-8-6**] CXR showed diffuse pulmonary edema with large bilateral effusions, likely a result of aggressive fluids.
# [**Name (NI) **] pt with increasing leukocytosis over several days with no clear source, with 4+ GNRs, klebsiella pna and pseudomonas on [**8-6**] sputum despite vancomycin and aztreonam treatment, and low grade fever.
# Infected PEG tube/ abscess/ necrotizing fasciitis - pt with recurrent fevers and bandemia while at rehab despite antibiotics.
Pt was taken to OR by general surgery on [**7-30**] for laparotomy s/p abscess drainage and debridement for necrotizing fasciitis.
Pt lost large volumes of fluid through the wound --> eventually a woundvac was placed, and surgery did not feel the wound was infected several days post-op, but that her poor nutritional status compromed wound healing.
Levo/ flagyl for gut flora coverage was started on admission --> changed to aztreonam on [**7-30**] when wound culture grew pseudomonas --> flagyl restarted and fluconazole added on [**7-31**] for anaerobic and yeast coverage s/p surgical debridement; patient was on vancomycin, flagyl, and fluconazole when she expired.
# R hand discoloration: The patient developed RUE swelling and purplish discoloration.
RUE doppler US  was negative for DVT.
Vascular surgery thought there was evidence of vascular emboli in her hands though this was also thought possibly secondary to frequent FS checks.
# hyponatremia - etiology thought to be hypervolemic hyponatremia  from vasopressin administration or from multiple fluid boluses.
# hyperglycemia - pt had increased glucose on FSS on [**8-1**] --> insulin added to TPN, increased FS again, so insulin gtt was started .
# Anemia- macrocytic, baseline hct 25-30.
Fe studies here are consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
History of LVH in setting of critical aortic stenosis is concerning for possible subendocardial ischemia in the setting of decreased hct.
#) MSSA bacteremia - pt with recurrent fevers and bandemia while at rehab despite antibiotics in setting of history of pneumonia and MSSA bacteremia, for which she was on vancomycin.
# Acid/base - primary nonanion gap metabolic acidosis with primary respiratory alkalosis; an increase in bicarb was seen on [**8-8**] - probable contraction alkalosis given volume depletion, subseqyently resolved.
# FEN- electrolytes were repleted as needed (K, Mg, Phos); she was fed via tubefeeds, nutrition was consulted and made recommendations throughout.. .
# Access- R PICC, L subclavian .
