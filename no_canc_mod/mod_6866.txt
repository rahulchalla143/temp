Admission Date:  [**2132-11-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2132-11-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2055-11-19**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 76 year old, white female with known coronary artery disease, recently increased in symptoms.
Coronary artery disease.
Questionable transient ischemic attack.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of endocarditis at age 40.
Status post upper gastrointestinal bleed, due to aspirin.
Status post colon polypectomy.
Chronic back pain.
On the morning of [**2132-11-11**], the patient had carotid ultrasound which showed no significant stenosis in either carotid and the patient was taken to the operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] on [**11-11**].
As the assistants were placing the lines, the patient became hypotensive with ischemic electrocardiogram changes.
The patient became profoundly hypotensive, requiring chest compression and intravenous epinephrine.
At the end of the case, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed and the patient was started on epinephrine, Levophed, Vasopressin as well as Lidocaine and Amiodarone for ventricular ectopy.
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where she had several episodes of hypotension requiring volume resuscitation.
The patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram at the bedside in the Intensive Care Unit for low cardiac index and profound hypotension.
This showed a dilated and severely hypokinetic right ventricle with an ejection fraction of 40% and global hypokinesis, mild central mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid regurgitation, an intact thoracic aorta and a balloon pump that was in good placement.
The patient was started on Milrinone for her right ventricular dysfunction with the Milrinone and volume resuscitation.
The patient continued to have varying requirements for vasopressors, continuing to require Epinephrine, Levophed and Vasopressin to maintain adequate blood pressure.
It was felt that the Vasopressin was contributing to Syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone.
The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation which she tolerated well with continued good blood pressure and cardiac index.
On postoperative day number five, the patient again had an episode of atrial fibrillation which resulted in oliguria.
The patient was given fluid boluses without any improvement.
The patient converted to sinus rhythm spontaneously and oliguria resolved.
The wound was packed wet to dry.
The patient was also draining moderate amounts of serous fluid from the knee and distal portion of the vein harvest site.
On postoperative day number nine, the superior thigh wound looked clean and a VAC dressing was placed.
Chest x-ray on [**11-20**] showed small bilateral effusions, no pneumothorax, no consolidations.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
There is no erythema.
There is no drainage.
The right lower extremity and upper thigh wound is dehisced about six to seven cm, about three to four cm deep, with good granulation tissue at the edges.
There is no surrounding erythema.
The knee and ankle portions of the incision are closed, draining serous fluid.
Right thigh wound dehiscence.
