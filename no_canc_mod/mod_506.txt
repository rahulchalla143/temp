No pneumothorax.
Worsening right middle lobe opacification.
Possible small left pleural effusion.
Dense right middle lobe pneumonia.
No pulmonary emboli visualized.
No large or central emboli to account for the patient's hypotension.
Questionable calcifications in deep right breast.
CXR [**12-19**]:  IMPRESSION: Interval slight worsening of bilateral interstitial and alveolar opacities consistent with pulmonary edema.
CXR [**12-22**]:  IMPRESSION: Improvement since prior film with significant resolution of the pulmonary edema but persistent interstitial densities and focal opacities at right base, as described.
No pneumothorax.
U/S ABD [**12-23**]:  1) Partially distended gallbladder without cholelithiasis.
The gallbladder wall is thickened which could represent early acute cholecystitis in the correct clinical setting.
A follow-up ultrasound or HIDA scan is recommended if there is continued clinical concern.
2) Small amount of ascites which is seen tracking around the gallbladder.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with  mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve  prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Pulmonary edema superimposed on a baseline of diffuse emphysema, with nodular interstitial thickening suggesting additional superimposed infection.
The appearances of the lung, and specifically, the areas of diffuse interstitial thickening and pulmonary edema, have worsened significantly since the examination from [**2131-12-18**].
The dense opacity at the right middle lobe has improved, although there are new opacities in the inferior aspects of the lingula and anterior left lower lobe.
Brief Hospital Course: 54yo woman with extensive psychiatric history presented with RML pnuemonia.
She did not have any positive blood cultures.
She was quickly weaned from the levophed, and maintained appropriate MAP without any pressor support.
Pulmonary Edema:  - developed pulmonary edema after fluid resuscitation, requiring supplemental oxygen, bipap, and ultimately intubation for progressive hypoxia and respiratory failure.
- aggressively diuresed with lasix, secondarily developing metabolic alkalosis that responded to KCl infusion.
- weaned down from AC to Pressure support ventilation; pressure support weaned, spontaneous breathing trial completed, and patient was extubated successfully and transferred out of the unit to the medical floor.
While on the medical floor she was weaned off supplemental oxygen and was O2satting in mid 90s on RA  Psych:  - Extensive psychiatric history.
Abdominal Pain:  -  Pt had some intermittent complaints of abdominal pain that were pursued with abd ultrasound.
No significant pathology was elucidated.
Her pain resolved by the time of discharge.
