She also had moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Past Medical History: Diabetes Sick sinus syndrome -> PPM [**2184**] Breast Cancer HTN Hyperlipidemia Past Small bowel obstruction Past GI bleed  Social History: Denies alcohol use or smoking.
Family History: + for CAD  Physical Exam: 98.9 103 152/87 94% RA NAD, A+Ox3 NECK: Supple, FROM, + carotid bruits bilaterally HEART: Irreg, irregular, III/VI diastolic murmur LUNGS: CTA ABD: Soft, nontender, nondistended, normaoactive bowel sounds.
Mild calcified plaque in the left internal carotid artery with the degree of stenosis evaluated as less than 40%.
The estimated degree of stenosis by the velocities correlates with the visual assessment.
No evidence of carotid stenosis on the right.
[**2187-6-4**] ECHO Conclusions: PRE-CPB The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic [**Month/Day/Year **] leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic [**Month/Day/Year **] stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral [**Month/Day/Year **] leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is partial posterior mitral leaflet flail involving P1 and P2.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
Mild pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Left ventricle with left septal "bounce" consistent with ventricular pacing and post-CPB status.
[**2187-6-9**] CXR Small right apical pneumothorax, slightly decreased in size since the prior radiograph of [**2187-6-6**].
Resolving left basilar atelectasis and improving small effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 13751**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2187-5-31**] for surgical management of her mitral [**Date Range **] disease and atrial fibrillation.
She was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which revealed mild left internal carotid artery disease and a normal right.
Ciprofloxacin was started for an E. Coli urinary tract infection.
Anticoagulation was started with coumadin given her preoperative atrial fibrillation and MAZE procedure.
