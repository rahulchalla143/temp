Generalized tonic-clonic seizure 2.
Small intracerebral hemorrhages on right frontotemporal and 3.
Aortic graft infection  Procedures:  1.
PICC line placement  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr [**Known lastname 732**] is a 26 year old right-handed man who was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital6 256**] from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 1096**] for multiple injuries sustained after a motor vehicle accident.
In summary, on [**10-20**], the patient sustained an unrestrained 28 feet ejection.
He sustained a severe head injury with a reported [**Location (un) 2611**] Coma Scale of 14 at the scene.
The patient developed a retrograde amnesia of the events preeceding the accident of about one hour and post traumatic amnesia for about two months.
He also developed traumatic aortic dissection, liver laceration, severe pulmonary contusion.
He was intubated for two and a half months due to recurrent pneumonias.
On [**1-19**] while at [**Hospital **] Hospital, he had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.
Blood cultures from [**1-19**] showed coagulase negative Staphylococcus as well as coagulase negative Staphylococcus which was resistant to Cephalin.
Lungs with coarse breathsounds bilaterally.
Abdomen was soft, no tenderness to palpation.
No cyanosis or edema of extremities.
Reflexes, reflexes were 2+ bilaterally at biceps, triceps and brachioradialis, patella, ankle and toes downgoing on both sides.
LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory values showed an INR of 1.5, chest x-ray showed a questionable left lower lobe atelectasis or infiltrate.
Computerized tomography scan did not show any obvious infarct or hemorrhage.
Generalized tonic clonic seizure assessment and management: -The patient was initially treated with 350 mg/die of Dilantin however, his PTN levels were repeatedly below the expected range.
Due to his history of liver damage, there was concern that the amount of free PTN would be higher as expected by the total serum PTN level.
During the present hospital course the patient did not have any other seizures.
A MRI scan showed very small hemorrhages in the right frontotemporal and left parietal lobes consistent with his history of head injury.
Aortic graft/repair -Because of the  central lines infection with coagulase negative Staphylococcus and his initial fevers, the patient was started on Vancomycin and the Infectious Disease service was consulted.
As per Infectious Disease recommendation, he needs to get three independent sets of blood cultures after he finishes his course of Vancomycin and will need close follow-ups because of the possibility of the aortic graft being infected is real and is of concern.
The Hematology Team concluded that he may have a thalassemic trait that is  clinically irrelevant at the present time.
He should get three sets of independent blood draws after Vancomycin is stopped to make sure that he doesn't have any nidus infectious that could potentially seed aortic graft.
