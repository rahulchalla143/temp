His post-op course was prolonged and complicated by tamponade, DVT and multi-organ failure.
An echo revealed worsening aortic insufficiency, now severe with an enlarging left ventricle.

Evaluate swallowing function.
Multiple consistencies of barium were administered as well as a half of a barium pill.
FINDINGS: There is a left vocal cord palsy, seen in AP projections, but no evidence of penetration or aspiration with any consistency of barium.
The patient swallowed half a barium pill without difficulty or holdup at any esophageal level.
Mild right-sided pharyngeal residue was present, but no left-sided pharyngeal residue.
IMPRESSION: Left vocal cord palsy, but no evidence of aspiration and penetration with any consistency of barium.
No holdup at any esophageal level with half of a barium pill.

Persistent opacification at the left base is consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss in the left lower lobe.
Aortic valve disease.
Left ventricular function.
Prosthetic valve function.
Right ventricular function.
No thrombus in the LAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Moderately dilated LV cavity.
Mildly depressed LVEF.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=45-50 %).
The appearance of the ascending aorta is consistent with a normal tube graft.
A mobile density is seen in the ascending aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection.
A mobile density is seen in the aortic arch consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection.
A mobile density is seen in the descending aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection.
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen there is a central jet with coaptation defect.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The appearance of the ascending aorta is consistent with a normal tube graft.

He was kept intubated overnight on day of surergy given history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] but woke neurologicaly intake and was extubated early on the morning of POD1.
After extubation he remained in the ICU to monitor his cardiac rhythm as he had had episode of junctional rhythm and history of Atrial fibrillation, EP service was consulted.
