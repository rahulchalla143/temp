Admission Date:  [**2158-2-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-2-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2091-1-30**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**] Chief Complaint: Elective admission for coronary and carotid angiography/angioplasty.
At that time, carotid angiography revealed 80-99% stenosis in the [**Country **].
No intervention was performed.
She was referred to a [**Country 1106**] surgeon, and deemed a poor surgical candidate.
This, however, was in the setting of poor PO intake and generally feeling unwell.
She was subsequently referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in consultation, and referred today for elective carotid and coronary angiography with endovascular intervention.
She denies ever experiencing any episodes of amaurosis, diplopia, visual loss, focal weakness, focal numbness, incoordination, gait difficulty, or headache.
No chest pain, no orthopnea or PND.
Hyperlipidemia Hypertension Hypothyroidism Deafness Carpal tunnel syndrome  Past surgical history: Status post hysterectomy  Social History: She is deaf and lives with her son.
Brother with myocardial infarction at age 58.
Father with myocardial infarction.
No carotid bruits.
Mild diffuse tenderness, non-focal.
Right groin (cath site): no bruit or hematoma.
No facial asymmetry.
Pertinent Results: [**2158-2-27**] CATHETERIZATION:  PTCA COMMENTS: Initial angiography demonstrated a tight 90% lesion of the [**Country **] sparing the bulb in a tortuous segment.
The lesion was then pre-dilated with a 2.5 x 20 mm Maverick at 8 ATM.
A 6.0 x 30 mm Acculink was then deployed at the origin of the [**Country **] but the [**Country **] missed covering the distal lesion.
Attempts to deliver a 6.0 x 20 mm Acculink failed secondary to incomplete expansion of the first [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] we post-dilated with a 4.5 x 20 mm Maverick at 12 ATM.
Attempts to recapture the filter failed secondary to inability to deliver beyond the proximal [**First Name3 (LF) **].
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenoses, no dissections, and normal flow.
The patient became hypotensive with catheter and balloon manipulation around the carotid bulb, but this was responsive to IV Phenylephrine.
Coronary angiography in this left-dominant circulation demonstrated no flow-limiting coronary artery disease.
The LAD, LCX and RCA had mild irregularity without significant disease.
Thoracic aorta:  Type I arch without lesions.
There were no critical lesions in the [**Country **].
There were no lesions in the posterior cerebral or cerebellar arteries.
The [**Doctor First Name 3098**] had a mid-segemnt 80-90% lesion with modest calcification.
**************** DATA FROM OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  [**2158-1-12**] Carotid Duplex: 80-99% stenosis at the origin of the right internal carotid artery.
The left side has a 16-49% stenosis at its origin.
Mild AS, peak/mean 26/15 mm Hg, peak aortic velocity 2.5 m/s.
No pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 year-old female with CAD, HTN, hypercholesterolemia and active smoker, admitted for elective coronary  and carotid angiography and endovascular intervention, now status post [**Country **] [**Country **] placement.
1) Carotid stenosis s/p [**Country **] [**Country **] placement: Post-procedure, she was continued on ASA, Plavix, as well as Lipitor.
Her hypotension was felt most likely secondary to excess vagal stimulation post carotid [**Country **] placement.
2) CAD: Cardiac catheterization revealed no flow limiting CAD on angiography.
As mentionned above, Metoprolol and Imdur were held in hospital given her relative hypotension, and should be reintroduced as an out-patient.
3) COPD: No acute issues in hospital.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Carotid stenosis status post carotid [**First Name (STitle) **] placement Coronary artery disease Hyperlipidemia Hypertension  Secondary diagnoses: Hypothyroidism Deafness   Discharge Condition: Patient discharged home in stable condition.
He will check your blood pressure and restart some of your medications.
