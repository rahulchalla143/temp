[**2195-4-9**] Sacroiliac screw fixation of left hemipelvis and cyst.
Irrigation and debridement left elbow laceration down to fascia.
Thoracic aortography.
He was taken to an area hospital where he was found to be hypotensive and was intubated on arrival.
A chest tube was placed, his blood pressure varied between 80 and 115 systolic and was dependent upon transfusion of blood and blood products.
FAST examination which suggested a hematoma in the right kidney.
The CXR and Pelvic AP films showed no bleeding site.
Evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage.
FINDINGS: No intra- or extra-axial bleed, masses, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures is noted.
No acute major vascular territorial infarcts are evident.
No acute fractures.
Mild mucosal thickening in left maxillary sinus and moderate opacification of bilateral anterior and posterior ethmoid air cells, likely secondary to patient's intubation is noted.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process or hemorrhage.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2195-4-7**] 9:23 AM FINDINGS: A focus of ovoid hyperdense material is noted in the posterior nasopharynx.
There are no acute fractures or alignment abnormalities of the cervical spine.
Right posterior first and second rib and left posterior first rib fractures are evident.
There is soft tissue emphysema coursing along the left posterior intramuscular planes.
Apical chest tube with a left apical pneumothorax is also noted.
There is opacification of bilateral ethmoid air cells, likely due to intubation.
Multiple prominent lymph nodes measuring up to 8 mm in short axis not enlarged by CT criteria.
No acute fractures or alignment abnormalities of the cervical spine.
Right first rib and bilateral second rib fractures.
Left apical pneumothorax and soft tissue emphysema.
Layering hyperdense material in the posterior nasopharyngeal wall of uncertain etiology, may represent chipped dental enamel, post intubation, clinical correlation is recommended.
No definite underlying fracture is seen.
Diffuse soft tissue swelling is noted.
Sinus tachycardia.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic wall is thickened consistent with an intramural hematoma.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a enhancement at the junction of the aortic arch and descendiong thoracic aortic consistent with a stent.
Vascular and Orthopedics Surgery were also consulted because of his injuries.
His vascular injury - aortic tear with associated para-aortic hematoma at thoracic T4-5 level was not repaired initially as he was deemed stable and required repair of his other multiple injuries more urgently.
He was taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy and placement of his left chest tube by Trauma Surgery.
Orthopedics also performed irrigation and debridement of the open left elbow wound and closed reduction of the fracture same site.
There were no intraoperative complications; postoperatively he was taken to the Trauma ICU.
Two days later he was taken back to the operating room for placement of IVC filter and insertion of superior left chest tube; also underwent by Orthopedic surgery sacroiliac screw fixation of left hemipelvis and examination under anesthesia left elbow with irrigation and debridement left elbow laceration down to fascia.
A left elbow external fixator remains in place; he will follow up in [**Hospital 5498**] clinic 2 weeks after discharge.
There were no intraoperative complications.
He was evaluated by Speech Language Pathology for evaluation of his oral and pharyngeal swallow function.
He was recommended for a video swallow which showed mild oral residue and residue seen in the valleculae and piriform sinuses without any evidence of aspiration.
Because of his extensive injuries Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted early and have continued to work with him.
He has made slow gains and is being recommended for rehab post acute hospitalization.
