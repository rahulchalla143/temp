Patient complained of some chest discomfort on the night of [**11-2**] while eating dinner and was noted to have elevated cardiac biomarkers.
She became anxious and then developed throat "heaviness" that subsequently radiated to her chest, which pt states is consistent with her previous anginal and heart attack symptoms.
The chest pressure was associated with diaphoresis and SOB but pt denied palpitations, dizziness, nause, vomiting.
She was taken to the hospital by her husband and by the time she reached [**Name (NI) 8530**] her chest pressure had subsided completely but she did have some abdominal discomfort.
In [**Location (un) **], she was hypotensive and central line was placed.
No EKG shown.
Per report, there were some gallbladder thickening and the initial thought was hypotension/sepsis from a gallbladder source prompting her transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] with for management of possible cholangitis.
The week prior she endorsed increasing orthopnea having to sleep upright and also noticed some increase LE swelling for which she was taking [**2-22**] additional lasix 20 mg pills on top of her morning 20 mg lasix.
On presentation to [**Hospital1 1516**], she denies any chest pain or shortness of breath.
She also denied abdominal pain.
She was also finishing her last day of azithromycin for an upper respiratory infection.
She reports that over the last 6 days, she has also noticed increasing LE edema for which she has been taking increasing doses of Lasix.
She also complains of worsening orthopnea.
She is able to walk [**1-21**] blocks with no chest pain.
On cardiac review of symptoms as stated above.
- Carotid stenosis s/p CEA - HTN - Hyperlipidemia - h/o pericarditis x 1 - Rheumatoid arthritis on DMARDs - s/p wrist fusion - s/p multiple joint replacements - C4-5 neck fusion - Restrictive lung disease (rheumatoid lung) - Asthma questionable - s/p TAH for precancerous uterine lesion .
Central abdominal bruit heard.
EXT: [**1-21**]+ lower extremity edema below the knees.
[**2-25**] holosystolic murmur best over apex LUNGS: Lungs CTAB, No wheezes, rales, rhonchi.
EXT: Left leg erythema, warm and tenderness vastly improved though still present.

The gallbladder findings may be secondary to third-spacing from volume overload.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilation.
No evidence of aortic dissection or aneurysm as questioned.
Atherosclerotic change and ulcerated plaque throughout the imaged aorta.
Dilated air and fluid-containing esophagus which is unchanged.
The appearance could be seen with a connective tissue disorder such as scleroderma.
New, extensive and diffuse peribronchovascular, ground-glass and nodular bilateral lung opacities which likely represent pulmonary edema and/or superimposed atypical infectious or inflammatory process.
Bibasilar fibrosis that was demonstrated on prior chest CT is largely obscured by this process.
1.3-cm hyperdense left renal lesion which is slightly larger than in [**2121**] and does not clearly enhance.
Features are most suggestive of a hemorrhagic cyst, however, as some types of renal cell carcinoma could have a similar appearance, further follow up is recommended.
Mild stenosis of the left subclavian artery at its origin.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal 2/3rds of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-21**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA distribution).
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation most likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction.
Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review) of [**2119-1-10**], the left ventricular regional dysfunction is new and c/w interim ischemia/infarction.
-[**11-7**] LLE Doppler: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left leg.
-[**11-7**] ABI: IMPRESSION: Mild left common iliac arterial inflow insufficiency and mild right popliteal outflow arterial disease.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 8529**] is a 61F with significant history of CAD with multiple stents presenting from OSH with abdominal pain initially concerning for cholangitis and hypotensive episode requiring pressors, transferred from [**Hospital1 18**] SICU for NSTEMI.
NSTEMI: After transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she was found to have troponin elevated to 1.33->.1.23-> 1.24, likely ACS vs demand ischemia in the setting of the hypotensive episode at the OSH.
EKGs remained normal and unchanged from previous, and pt was chest pain free.
TTE showed new left ventricular regional dysfunction c/w interim ischemia/infarction.
Her enalapril and nifidipine were held during admission given recent hypotensive episode and multiple doses of contrast.
CHF- echo [**2118**] showed EF> 55 percent but exam notable for bilateral crackles, elevated JVP, and lower extremity edema.
She also had an elevated BNP.
#  New onset atrial fibrillation at OSH - etiology may be secondary to infectious process (UTI or pneumonia) vs. secondary to ischemia from NSTEMI.
Leukocytosis: on admission to [**Location (un) **], she received stress dose steroids and had a WBC of 44K on admission to [**Hospital1 18**], likely secondary to stress dose of steroids.
The outside hospital noted gall bladder thickening but US done at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**11-3**] did not show evidence of acute cholecystitis and abdominal exam is benign so evolving cholangitis was unlikely (see below).
# UTI- Ucx were negative, but initial UA showed UTI.
Vanc and unasyn were switched on the cardiology floor to PO bactrim and ampicillin, but the pt spiked fevers and her cellulitis worsened (see below).
Vanc and unasyn were switched on the cardiology floor to PO bactrim and ampicillin, but the pt spiked fevers and her cellulitis worsened.
Fe studies were c/w anemia of chronic dz.
CHRONIC ISSUES: .
#RA: Continued prednisone taper; in the context of possible infection leflunomide and simponi were held.

You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] because you were sick with very low blood pressures.
You were treated in the intensive care unit, and were then moved to the cardiology floor because you were found to have blood tests suggestive of a type of heart attack called an NSTEMI (non ST-elevation myocardial infarction).
You also continued to receive antibiotics for your left leg skin infection and a urinary tract infection.
