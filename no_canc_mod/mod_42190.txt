The patient's brother corroborates this by saying he was told she may have had a seizure - he was unaware of a fall report.
She was brought to an outside hospital first where CT head was negative and a pelvic x-ray showed a pubic ramus fracture.
At that point, the OSH transferred her to [**Hospital1 18**] for orthopedic evaluation.
CT torso showed no other signs of trauma but had "evidence of aspiration" so she was given Levofloxacin/Metronidazole.

Possible right ventricular hypertrophy.
Modest ST-T wave changes are non-specific.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST [**2126-5-31**]: No fractures.
Multilevel degenerative changes.
Comminuted right intertrochanteric, left acetabular, left ischial, and left sacral fractures.
Mixed density right upper lobe nodule.
Probable pulmonary hypertension.
2.6-cm right adnexal cyst.
Nonspecific liver and renal hypodensities.
CXR [**2126-5-31**]: No acute intrathoracic process or radiographic evidence of injury.
Please refer to subsequent CT torso for further details, including small right apical lung nodules.
Fractures of the left acetabulum and ischium.
Severe bilateral hip and right knee osteoarthritis.
Short P-R interval.
Intraventricular conduction delay of right bundle-branch block type.
Since the previous tracing of [**2126-5-31**], the rate is faster, ST-T wave abnormalities are more prominent.
RUQ ULTRASOUND [**2126-6-4**]: Focal liver lesions seen on recent CT correspond to simple hepatic cysts.
The liver is otherwise normal in appearance showing no signs of cirrhosis or splenomegaly.
The extrahepatic common bile duct dilatation is also noted, which could be age-related ectasia, but clinical correlation is recommended.
No acute intracranial process.
Ventriculomegaly with dilation of the occipital horns is likely due to atrophy.
Chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
MR HEAD [**2126-6-5**]: No acute infarct seen.
Small vessel disease.
No evidence of ligamentous disruption of marrow edema within the vertebral bodies to suggest acute trauma.
Multilevel degenerative changes with disc bulging at multiple levels and minimal extrinsic indentation on the spinal cord by disc bulging at C3-4 level.
No evidence of intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities.
EEG [**2126-6-4**]: This is an abnormal awake and sleep EEG because of intermittent generalized frontally dominant bursts of slowing with admixed sharp features.
These findings are indicative of mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy most likely related to patient's history of static encephalopathy.
No electrographic seizures are present.
If clinical concern for seizures is high, a 24 hour bedside EEG telemetry study is recommended.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 48639**] is a 79 y/o lady w/ developmental delay who presented from her group home for a right pelvic and femur fracture.
Her stay was complicated by a brief MICU stay for post-operative tachycardia and hypotension (possibly due to blood loss) that resolved.
# Right pelvic and femur fracture: s/p surgery [**2126-5-31**].
She had a comminuted right intertrochanteric fracture, and a fracture of the left acetabulum and ischium.
Pain well controlled with Tylenol and low-dose narcotics (which were not needed by the time of discharge).
# Mechanism of fracture: unclear, possibly a seizure.
Since there was no fall, the fracture was initially suspicious for very severe osteoporosis in the setting of seizure versus possible elder abuse.
With regards to the cause, seizure was investigated due to her presentation.
It was fellt that risks of antiepileptics outweighed the benefits so she was not started on one this admission.
Tramadol was stopped due to risk of decreasing seizure threshold.
Has not had a BMD scan (she has a clinical diagnosis of osteoporosis given this fracture).
# Post-operative tachycardia/hypotension: requiring MICU stay, resolved.
Her tachycardia persisted and in the evening she developed hypotension to the 80's so she was observed in the MICU overnight.
With time her tachycardia and hypotension resolved and she was able to return to the medical floor the next day.
Finally, other etiologies that were considered peri-operative MI but this was ruled out by EKG and serial troponins.
# Acute anemia: likely from blood loss, now Hct stable.
She was s/p surgery with only 200cc blood loss, however did have pelvic/femur fractures which can bleed extensively.
No obvious signs of cirrhosis or hypersplenism.
No signs or symptoms to suggest TTP.
WBC 12.9 on presentation (neutrophil predominance, no bands) but no signs and symptoms of infection (negative urinalysis and urine cultures, blood cultures with no growth to date, and clear CXR).
No antibiotics were continued once she was admitted, and her leukocytosis resolved (WBC 6.8 at discharge).
Initial leukocytosis might have represented a stress response from her fracture.
# Hypertension: controlled.
Besides her episode of hypotension (see above) she did require her antihypertensive medications and her blood pressure was reasonably controlled.
# Mixed density right upper lobe nodule: incidental finding on CT. 6-month followup chest CT was recommended.
# Nonspecific liver and renal hypodensities: incidental finding on CT. Non-emergent abdominal ultrasound was recommended, and was done while she was an inpatient.
This revealed several simple hepatic cysts and mild dilation of the extrahepatic bile duct.
