On this admission, plastic surgery evaluated the wound and was not concerned for infection.
VAC was maintained with high density sponge.
When it became apparent that the wound would not close quickly enough by secondary intention, plan was for a latissimus flap to close the sternal wound with both plastic surgery and CT surgery involved.
# CHF/pleural effustion: Pt appeared hypervolemic on exam, with large L pl effusion on CXR.
TTE was a limited study due to the large, open sternal wound, but showed EF 60% and evidence of diastolic dysfunction.
On [**7-13**] pt had a thoracentesis with 1200cc of fluid removed.
# CAD s/p CABG: Pt had CABG [**5-3**] at OSH.
Hospital course was complicated by fluid overload and wound dehiscence.
Clinically, no CP or anginal symptoms.
Hematuria then resolved and hct remained stable.
# Acute Renal Failure: This was likley due to contrast andminstration at outside hospital and quickly resolved.
Creatinine again bumped up slightly, likely due to diuresis.
# Infection/?PNA: CXR on admission shows that the heart is enlarged.
There were no overt signs of failure.
Considerable opacification at the left base was present.
This may have been related to an effusion, extensive pleural thickening, or consolidation or subsegmental atelectasis.
Levofloxacin was started, but discontinued because no clinical signs of infection (no cough, fever, or elevated WBC count).
# Paroxysmal Afib/Rhythm: Pt is higher risk due to PFO seen on echo done at OSH.
Anticoagulation was stopped due to hematuria, then lovenox was restarted with no evidence of bleeding.
# Anxiety/agitation: On last admission, this was an active issue.
Pt is less anxious currently.
Once acute renal failure resolved, switched back to lovenox.
# Access: [**Name (NI) **], Pt has a RIJ clot visualized on chest CT on last admission.
PRS part [**2180-7-17**] Underwent sternal wound debridement and latissmus dorsi flap closure on [**2180-7-17**] without complications.
Post op pain and anixety were controlled, B/P was elevated and treated with lopressor and lisinopril.
congestion, JPs were SS and draining, and he had minimal edema.
Flap remained well perfused throughout hospital course with good cap refill, it was warm, and never showed signs of venous congestion.
On [**2180-7-21**] c/o SOB and felt as if his lungs were filled with fluid.
Had basilar crackles on exam and CXR showed fluid in R lung field.
O2 sats and symptoms improved with Lasix administration (goal was 500 negative per day) and his last Lasix dose was on [**2180-7-26**] (40 PO BID had been TID previous days) and it was stopped because his O2 sat was stable off of O2.
Wound Cx came back MRSA positive and he was started on Vancomycin on [**2180-7-25**] for a total of 14 days.
Gabapentin 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for anxiety.
If you have fever >101.5, severe pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, if the flap changes color or in sensation, if you have bleeding or discharge, or anything that causes you great concern, please return or go to local hospital.
