Apparently earlier today the patient began to c/o dizziness and midscapular pain.
Initially the patient was transferred to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1459**] Hospital and did not require pressors until arrival there.
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her vitals were HR 50s-80s, BP 90s-160/50s-60she was found to have pupils 5mm NR, unresponsive without sedation, and EKG with lateral deep ST depressions.
CT of the head revealed no ICH or mass effect.
Diabetes mellitus with last hemoglobin A1C of 8.7 in 12/[**2172**].
Chronic renal insufficiency baseline creat 1.7-2.0 .
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2163**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to D1 and PDCA), last cath [**3-/2164**] with elev R and L filling pressures, PTCA of RCA and 2 VD; last ETT-MIBI [**6-21**] 6 min on [**Doctor Last Name 4001**] protocol, no reversible defects.
CHF with EF 45-50% on last echo [**10-20**], mild LV systolic dysfunction, mildly depressed LV function, inf and mid inf HK, mild 1+MR.
Anemia - unclear etiology; baseline Hct 29-31, last iron studies nl [**7-21**]; per pt, has never had EGD or colonoscopy   Social History: SH: lives with her boyfriend at home, retired; previous tob user 2ppdx20 yrs, quit [**2155**]; no ETOH   Family History: FH: sig for father who deceased in his 50s from cirrhosis secondary to alcoholism; 1 brother deceased from MI in his 40s; other brother who died of lymphoma in his 50s  Physical Exam: Vitals: T 98.2 P 86 BP 122-163/55-65 R [**10-9**] Sat 99% on AC 500x22, PEEP 5, FiO2 60%, PIP 36 UO: minimal ABG: 7.21/50/21 on current settings Gen: obese caucasian female laying in bed at 30 degrees, unresponsive HEENT: pupils fixed and dilated at 5-6 mm, conjunctivae injected, OG and ET tube in place Neck: obese CV: RRR, no m/r/g Lungs: coarse breath sounds diffusely Ab: soft, protuberant Extrem: trace pitting pretibial edema BL LE, full dp/pt and radial pulses Skin: no rashes or ulcers Neuro: comatose, GCS score of 3, no pupillary/oculcephalic reflex, negative doll's eye, no knee or biceps reflexes, toes mute   Pertinent Results: Echocardiogram on [**2177-2-5**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity  size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly  thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Is there a history to suggest right ventricular ischemia or ARVC?
Head CT on [**2177-2-5**]: HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is no comparison.
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no shift of normally midline structures or ventricular dilatation.
There is poor differentiation of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter which could be due to technique or due to mild diffuse brain edema.
There is small amount of fluid in the nasopharynx.
Mucosal thickening is seen in the ethmoid sinus.
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
diffuse brain edema.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 65 yo F with a history of CAD s/p CABG, CHF (EF of 55% with basal inferior hypokinesis), pulmonary HTN, Stage IV CKD, DM and hypothyroidism who had a syncopal episode c/w cardiac arrest.
#Asystolic Cardiac Arrest: The precipitant of the cardiac arrest is unclear, but likely related to an MI.
Serum tox was negative, and BP is stable off pressors so a massive PE or tamponade is unlikely as well.
Intubated for unresponsiveness .
She has no pupillary/oculocephalic/corneal reflexes, indicating very poor prognosis.
She has evidence of anoxic brain injury on imaging.
She also appears to have an ?epidural hematoma vs. artifact on CT of the C spine, for which its contribution to her presentation is unclear.
Neurology consulted:  "Recent AAN guidelines suggest that the most specific indicators of prognosis are absent pupillary light response, absent corneal reflexes, extensor or worse motor response to pain, myoclonus status epilepticus, elevated serum neuron-specific enolase, and absent somatosensory evoked potential studies (Wijdicks, et [**Doctor Last Name **], Neurology [**2175**];67:203-210).
The neurologic examination three days after the event has been demonstrated to be a reliable indicator of prognosis, however the literature supports the notion that patients with absent brainstem reflexes at any time after the event have relatively poor prognosis with low likelihood of returning to a high functional status. "
#Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Acidemia: Likely related to altered mental status.
Hyperventilated pt given brain anoxic injury .
#Elevated cardiac enzymes: The patient likey has elevated enzymes secondary to defibrillation as well as possible ACS.
Her troponin is also elevated in the setting of renal failure.
EKG on admission revealed lateral ST depressions.
She likely has at least an element of demand in the setting of known CAD and hypotension.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's Cr is 3.1, with BL of 2.2-2.8.
The patient's renal insufficiency is unlikely to account for the hyperkalemia as her creatinine is not far from baseline.
#Hyperkalemia: Likely secondary to respiratory acidosis as well as renal failure.
