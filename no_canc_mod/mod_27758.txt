Admission Date:  [**2133-6-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-7-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2073-11-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9569**] Chief Complaint: Lower Back Pain with LE weakness beginning [**2133-6-8**]  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Laminectomy T12-L2 Single wire pacemaker placed   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 59 y/o Cantonese female with a h/o Atrial fibrillation and mechanical MVR (Bjork-Shiley) secondary to RHD experienced low back pain and LE weakness beginning on [**2133-6-8**].
MRI of the lumbar spine revealed a cystic mass at the T12-L2, which was found to be a hematoma upon surgical exploration on [**2133-6-12**] and was subsequently evacuated.
Pt has been on Coumadin and digoxin due to her cardiac hx and initially her INR was 3.5.
During the operation the pt experienced episodes of bradycardia with right neck manipulation and swan-ganz catheter placement c/w vagal etiology, however bradycardia and pauses continued for following the surgery.
Pt demonstrated NSVT believed to be d/t digoxin toxicity (1.1).
Currently pt c/o pain in right leg from the buttock down to the ankle on the lateral calf, diminishing distally.
No c/o CP other than at the incision site for the pacemaker, no SOB, no LH.
Difficulty with using bedside commode due to pain and reports no BM, but positive flatus.
No tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs.
HEENT: EOMI NECK: JVP noted b/l, no JVD CV: Irregularly irregular, tachycardic; Loud S1, S2, no M/R/G/C noted; heart beat noted visibly across the chest and by palpation.
No carotid bruits.
Ext warm, with no cyanosis or edema.
No right leg tenderness.
Neuro: AOx3; observed exam by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] (ortho) - weakness in right hallux extension; left LE weakness improving, left knee extension at 2/5 strength.
Associated large veins are suggestive of a vascular malformation.
If the hematoma is intradural, a spinal cord arteriovenous malformation is likely.
A conventional angiogram is recommended for assessment of vascular malformation.
MRI L-Spine [**2133-6-13**]: IMPRESSION: Status post decompression of a large dorsal epidural hematoma, there is soft tissue swelling which continues to impress the distal cord and proximal cauda equina.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Severe biatrial enlargement.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
PM Interrogation [**2133-6-24**]: PM functioning properly   Brief Hospital Course: 59 yo Cantonese F with history of Atrial fibrillation, Mitral valve replacement presented with epidural hematoma and lower extremity weakness.
Patient was found to have NSVT/?junctional tachycardia likely secondary to digoxin toxicity.
The patient p/w spontaneous epidural hematoma and LE weakness on [**2133-6-12**].
At the time of admission the patient's INR was 3.5 as she was taking 3.5mg coumadin PO Qhs for prophylactic anticoagulation due to her h/o afib and MVR.
In the perioperative period the patient began having episodes of bradycardia and pauses for which a single wire pacemaker was placed on [**2133-6-14**], with confirmation of proper lead placement by CXR.
Additionally in this time she developed mild anemia likely due to the spontaneous hematoma and surgical blood loss for which she received a total of 2 units of PRBCs and has since resolved.
During this time the patient was continued on Lanoxin for her atrial fibrillation and developed a NSVT/?
junctional tachycardia likely due to digoxin toxicity.
Following evacuation of her epidural hematoma she developed right LE pain, which was attributed to a radiculpathy and was successfully treated with Neurontin 100mg TID.
Ceftriaxone was stopped on [**2133-6-29**] and the patient remained afebrile and asymptomatic.
Both incisions healed well without current drainage, erythema, edema, or tenderness.
Lastly during her hospital course she developed some bladder irritation/spasms and hematuria likely due to foley catheter trauma.
She has since been asymmptomatic and without hematuria.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Epidural hematoma s/p evacuation, periop brady/pause s/p single wire pacemaker placement, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia secondary to digoxin toxicity   Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: Please take all medications as prescribed.
Contact primary care physician or return to hospital if experience chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, worsening lower extremity weakness, or other concerns.
