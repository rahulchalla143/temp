Multiple cervicothoracic spine and rib fractures, ultimately concerning for spinal instability at the cervicothoracic region.
Non-displaced right scapula and right distal clavicle fractures.
Widening of the anterior aspect of the C6-C7 intervertebral disc space, concerning for ligamentous injury.
Somewhat lobulated pleural thickening along the right lung apex, non-specific.
Findings could relate to chronic scarring, prior asbestos exposure (if patient has history of such) or underlying trauma  MRI spine [**2181-12-17**]: 1.
Multiple cervical spine fractures are as previously described on CTA neck of [**2181-12-16**].
Posterior ligamentous complex injury at least from C6 to T2, multifocal disruption of the ligamentum flavum on the right from C6 through T2, and probable injury to the anterior longitudinal ligament at C6-C7 with widening of the anterior intervertebral disc space again suggest grossly unstable cervical spine injuries.
No evidence of cord injury or cord compression.
Small epidural hematoma noted layering posteriorly in the upper cervical spine.
Bilateral pleural thickening with somewhat lobulated contour in the right lung apex, as seen on CT.
Recommend correlation with prior asbestos exposure and/or history of malignancy.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
[**2181-12-21**] MRI Head : There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
There is no evidence of diffusion abnormalities to suggest acute or subacute ischemic changes.
Bilateral opacities involving the mastoid air cells and also mucosal thickening is demonstrated in the ethmoidal, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses as described above.
Limited examination due to motion artifact and superimposed metal artifacts related with posterior instrumentation as described above.
Grossly, there is no evidence of spinal cord edema or cord expansion.
A compression fracture is again redemonstrated at T2 level, apparently unchanged since the prior studies.
Post-surgical changes identified from C3 through T1 levels consistent with posterior decompression, laminectomies, posterior arthrodesis and lateral instrumentation at C4-C5 levels.
No gross change of cervical alignment.
No evidence of immediate hardware complications.
Underwent MRI showing diffuse spinal ligamentous injury in the cervical and thoracic spine.
On [**2181-12-20**] he required re intubation for somnolence.
He had a repeat head CT which showed no intracranial hemorrhage and an MRI on [**2181-12-21**] corroborated these findings.
He appeared to have right shoulder weakness and had a repeat MRI of the C spine which was unchanged.
A Chest Xray done on re intubation showed a left lower lobe pneumonia and his BAL was positive for H flu.
He was able to tolerate a regular diet and had multiple assessments by the Speech and Swallow service to assure his safety.
He had repeat CT scans of the cervical and thoracic spine on [**2181-12-29**] which showed no new findings and he was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] who noted a slight decreased strength in the right shoulder compared to the left, possible due to pain.
C6-T1 spinous process fractures 2.
Right T1-2 compression fracture 3.
Bilateral C7 facet fractures 4.
Right non displaced scapula fracture 5.
Right non displaced distal clavicle fracture 6.
Left posterior 1st rib fracture 7.
Right posterior 2nd rib fracture 8.
Pneumonia 9.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
* You sustained multiple injuries including a broken spinal bones, rib fractures, collarbone and [**Doctor First Name 362**] bone fractures.
*  Your injury caused rib fractures which can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the pain.
*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths.
If the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and notify your physician.
*  You had pneumonia during this hospitalization.
Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.
*  You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and deep breathing.
*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid and fiber intake if possible.
*  Do NOT smoke  *  Do NOT drink alcohol  *  Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation around your ribs ( crepitus ).
