Felt likely viral illness.

At [**Name (NI) **] pt had smear Positive for babesiosis.
Received "gentle" IVF for fevers and developed hypoxia.
No blood transfusion given.
No night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
+ mild SOB which pt compares to nasal congestion.
+ right posterior back pain, last episode prior to admit to [**Hospital1 **].
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.

Past Medical History: Osteoarthritis Osteopenia Raynauds syndrone seasonal allergies insomia s/p tonsillectomy s/p mastoidectomy bilaterally   Social History: Lives in [**Hospital1 **] in 2 apt house.
Family History: Notable for heart disease and arthritis.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T 102.3 P  86 BP 134/55 R 20 O2 sat 95 3LNC General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP 5cm above clavicle, no LAD Lungs: Crackles BL to upper lung fields with decreased BS on bases.
no wheezes or  ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, 2/6 SEM, LUSB, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis.
There are new bibasilar opacities, which could represent a combination of infection, aspiration, or atelectasis with pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
[**2196-7-23**] TTE Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**1-8**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for review) of [**2190-10-20**], the aortic regurgitation may be slightly increased; otherwise no obvious change.
[**2196-7-25**] CXR: There is significant interval improvement seen as decrease in pulmonary edema, improvement of the bilateral basal aeration and decrease in still present small bilateral pleural effusions.
There are no new areas of consolidation.
There is no mediastinal widening with stable appearance of the cardiac silhouette which is mildly enlarged.
There is no pneumothorax.
DISCHARGE LABS (722/09): BLOOD WBC-4.3 RBC-3.14* Hgb-9.1* Hct-27.4* MCV-87 MCH-29.1 MCHC-33.3 RDW-15.9* Plt Ct-189 Glucose-102 UreaN-13 Creat-0.9 Na-131* K-4.6 Cl-99 HCO3-24 AnGap-13 03:20PM BLOOD Na-132* Calcium-8.8 Phos-4.8* Mg-2.1  Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 y/o with Raynaud's, no significant heart or lung history who presented from [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with intermittent fevers and fatigue for 3 weeks and parasite smear + for babesiosis and SOB.
# Fevers, malaise: The patient had a parasite smear at [**Hospital1 **] positive for babesiosis.
Fatigue and fevers were consistent with Babesiosis, as was recent tick exposure.
New onset anemia and thrombocytopenia were also consistent.
The patient was treated with Atovaquone and Azithro for Babesiosis.
She was also treated with Doxycycline for possibly Lyme disease - it was continued when her Lyme titer came back positive.
The patient likely had flash pulmonary edema, given her lung findings, elevated JVP, h/o valvulopathy, and new onset arrthymia.
ECHO showed moderate aortic regurgitation.
ARDS was possible in the setting of Babesiosis, but unlikely since the patient had other signs of heart failure and had minimal oxygen requirement.
When the patient was transferred from the MICU to the floor, she no longer had SOB and did not require oxygen.
Her exam was consistent with hypervolemic hyponateremia.
# PAF: The patient had new onset Afib [**7-21**] and spontaneously converted back to NSR.
She was started on Lovenox in the MICU, but it was discontinued since she developed afib in the setting of an infection and spontaneously converted back to NSR.
On transfer to the floor, the patient was back in atrial fibrillation with RVR, HR 130-140s.
#  Anemia: The patient had a low HCT during her hospitalization.
There was no obvious GI bleed.
Disp:*28 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital3 **] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses Babesiosis Lyme disease Atrial fibrillation  Secondary Diagnoses Anemia Pulmonary edema   Discharge Condition: Stable, improved, afebrile, normal sinus rhythm   Discharge Instructions: You were treated in the hospital for Babesiosis and Lyme disease, which are infections that were in your blood.
You were continued on Azithromycin and Atovaquone to treat Babesiosis and Doxycycline to treat Lyme disease.
The Babesiosis has caused you to have a low blood count, also known as anemia, but this has been stable for several days prior to discharge.
You were having trouble breathing when you were admitted, which was due to fluid in your lungs.
You were also found to have an abnormal heart rhythm, called atrial fibrillation, likely due to the infections.
