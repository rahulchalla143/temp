PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH  FINDINGS:  Since most recent film, there is probably slight increase in size to right- sided small effusion with stable appearance to left-sided small effusion.
Left lower lobe/retrocardiac atelectasis persists.
There is no evidence of pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
Enlarged cardiac silhouette is unchanged and the hilar contours are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Slight increase in size to small bilateral pleural effusions (right greater than left).
Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis.

No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
No atheroma in ascending aorta.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Results were personally  Conclusions:   Prebypass  1.No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2.Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
3.There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
That evening she had atrial flutter treated with Amiodarone and beta blockers which she converted to sinus rhythm.
