History of Present Illness: 84 year old female with a well known history of mitral valve regurgitation followed by serial echocardiogram.
She was evaluated for a cough in early [**2198-1-13**] and was noted to be in mild congestive heart failure.
Symptoms include dyspnea on exertion such as climbing stairs, or carrying a laundry basket.
As she began to develop a dilated left ventricle last year, the recommendation for surgery had already been made however she was reluctant to proceed.
Given her severe mitral regurgitation, she has been referred for surgical management.
