For management of her elevated blood pressures, she received 10mg IV labetalol, hydralazine and metoprolol 5mg IV.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2124-12-12**] 11:59 AM IMPRESSION: Stable cardiomegaly with no signs of failure or acute pneumonia.
Acute infarction of the left corona radiata and the left posterior aspect of the putamen.
Focal area of infarction in the right parietal lobe.
This distribution is indicative of a central source of emboli-like a cardiac source.
Changes consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease and old lacunar infarctions.
Stenosis of the right M1 segment.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2124-12-13**] at 11:01:15 AM IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism identified.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
The degrees of mitral and aortic regurgitation are slightly less on the current study.

In the short term, a joint decision between neurology and cardiology was made to hold off on anticoagulation out of fear for hemorrhagic conversion and to continue her aspirin and plavix.
Her echo showed preserved EF, no evidence of embolic source and no PFO.
Her lipid panel showed elevated lipids including an LDL of 113, and so her lipitor was increased from 20 to 80 mg daily and zetia 10 mg daily was added.
She was originally scheduled for PEG placement [**2124-12-18**], but this was postponted until [**12-21**] as she was quite hypertensive immediately before the initially scheduled PEG placement.
