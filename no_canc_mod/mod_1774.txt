Also, at her presentation at [**Location (un) 12017**] Regional, the patient had a U/A finding that was consistent with UTI and was started on levofloxacin.
Myocardial infarction times two, status post three vessel CABG in [**2182**]; SVG to LAD, SVG to left circumflex, and SVG to RCA.

The patient complained of mild sternal incisional pain which was controlled with p.o.
