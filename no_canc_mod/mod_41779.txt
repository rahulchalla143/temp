She states that the pain has no exacerbating or alleviating factors but has been persistent over this period of time.
There was no fat stranding but given these findings she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

Sacral Skin Decub She has and area of skin breakdown that appears to be partial thickness with few areas of increased depth.
focus of calcific irregularity along the right aspect of the aneurysmal sac is stable since the 6:18 reference examination.
Severe right femoralacetabular osteoarthritis.
TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired 2.5-mm axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained prior to and following the uneventful administration of 90 cc of Visipaque intravenous contrast.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Included views of the lung bases demonstrate mild dependent atelectasis.
There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and no free air or free fluid.
The patient is post left colectomy with a right lower quadrant loop ileostomy, with no evidence of obstruction.
Extensive colonic diverticulosis is present, with no evidence of diverticulitis.
No adnexal masses are present.
There is no intrapelvic free fluid or lymphadenopathy.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is no acute fracture.
Severe osteoarthritic changes are seen within the right femoroacetabular joint (3:131, 400B:23), where there is complete loss of joint space with extensive sclerosis and subchondral cystic change.
There are no bony lesions concerning for malignancy or infection.
There is loss of the L5-S1 disc space with vacuum phenomenon and posterior osteophytosis with mild thecal sac narrowing.
The aneurysmal sac arises from the right side of the aorta and demonstrates peripheral coarse calcifications, with focal area of calcific irregularity at the lateral-most edge (3:52), with no neighboring stranding to suggest an active rupture.
The appearance of the aneurysmal sac is unchanged in comparison to the 8:19 p.m. reference examination, but is markedly enlarged since [**2172-5-13**] reference exam.
Moderate atherosclerotic calcifications extend throughout the abdominal aorta and iliac branches.
48-mm right saccular infrarenal AAA, markedly increased in size since [**2172**], with mild irregularity of the lateral-most calcific borders placing this at high risk for rupture.
No active rupture is detected.
Severe right femoroacetabular osteoarthritis.
Post-left colectomy and right lower quadrant loop ileostomy, with no evidence of obstruction.
DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] DR. [**First Name (STitle) 8085**] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8086**] Approved: FRI [**2174-7-22**] 5:27 PM    Brief Hospital Course: 76 year old female with a history of CAD, HTN, atrial fibrillation, RBBB diverticulitis status post left colectomy with loop ileostomy and oxygen-dependent COPD on steroids who presented on [**2174-7-21**] with progressive abdominal pain over the past few weeks.
She went to an outside hospital where CT with oral contrast only demonstrated an expansion of an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm that was saccular in shape without an adequate neck for endovascular repair.
However, she was complaining of significant pain and was tender over her aneurysm.
A CT angiography was obtained, despite an elevated creatinine, that did demonstrate concerning expansion of her aneurysm without any evidence of rupture.
However, it was felt with her progressive pain and tenderness over the aneurysm and the saccular shape that she was at incredibly high risk for imminent rupture.
We therefore admitted her for urgent repair of her juxtarenal AAA.
On POD #1 she was extubated but required NIV for a short period.
She was noted to have a metabolic acidosis with a lactate of 2.3 and a WBC of 14 and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] with a creatinine on 1.6.
On POD 3 she had bursts of Afib overnight which was rete controlled with lopressor.
Her white count remained elevated and UA was positive so she was started on cipro.
On POD 12 her urine culture grew pseudomonas and she was noted to be incontinent so her foley was replaced.
Infectious disease recommended cefepeme for her pseudomonal UTI so she was started on cefepime and continued on flagyl.
Cardiology was consulted for two episodes of bradycardia to the 30's associated with SOB.
She continued to have episodic bradycardia and on POD 14 had multiple episodes of bradycardia associated with brief loss of consciousness.
The patient was transferred to the CCU where review of the telemetry strips revealed prolongation of the P-P interval with eventual sinus arrest and slow junctional escape leading to asystole, and then recovery of sinus node activity within a few seconds consistent with increased vagal tone.
Additionally on POD 18 she was noted to have right arm swelling and an UE US revealed a partially occlusive thrombus surrounding the PICC line.
There were no EKG changes and over the next several days she required multiple rounds of therapy with insulin, D50, Ca-gluconate and lasix for persistently elevated potassium levels.
The administration of kaexylate was differed in the setting of her end ileostomy with a concern for potential ischemia.
That evening she again had 2 episodes of bradycardia to the 20's consistent with elevated vagal tone which resulted on very transient loss of consciousness.
Over the next several days she continued to have short lived, asymptomatic episodes of tachycardia to the 130's which resolved spontaneously.
At the time of discharge she was tolerating a regular diet, she was afebrile and she was not tachycardic.

Discharge Condition: Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after a CT scan, to evaluate your complaints of abdominal pain, showed growth your abdominal aortic aneurysm.
It was felt that the aneurysm was causing your pain and at risk of bursting so you were brought to the operating room immediately for repair.
You were treated for a UTI and were found to have a low heart rate because of increased vagal tone and are being sent home with a medication to help control your heart rate.
