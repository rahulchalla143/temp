Pain felt "like heartburn."
No associated shortness of breath or nausea.
He notes that his pain is very similar to the MI he had in [**2168**].
He initially presented to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], where he was found to have ST elevations in II, III, and aVF and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], he was chest pain free.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p MI in [**2168**], treated with POBA per patient HTN--per chart; patient denies elevated BP Hyperlipidemia  Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use; he smoked from age 20 years x 1 PPD, stopped around age 40.
Family History: There is a strong family history of premature coronary artery disease: his father died of an MI at age 39 and all of his brothers have had MIs, usually in their 50s.
+DM  Physical Exam: VS: T 98.3, BP 127/72, HR 66, RR 24, O2 99% on 3L Gen: Pleasant, overweight middle aged male in no distress, resp or otherwise.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Distant heart sounds with RR, normal S1, S2.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP  Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP   Pertinent Results: EKG demonstrated NSR with normal axis and intervals and < 1mm STE with Q waves in III and aVF and Q waves in V1-V3 with poor R wave progression and J point elevation in V3.
He also had ST depresions in I, aVL, V1-V2 and STE in V5-V6 at the time, now resolved.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant patient revealed severe three vessel CAD.
The LAD gave rise to one large diagonal which had moderate proximal disease.
The LCX had a long mid lesion to 80% at its tightest.
The RCA had a discrete mid 70% lesion and a 70% distal with thrombus and a thrombotically occluded rPL that reconstituted via collaterals.
There was no gradient across the aortic valve.
LV gram with EF 45% with no significant mitral regurgitation.
There was inferobasal hypokinesis.
IABP placed and patient referred for surgery.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinetic inferior mid papillary segments..
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=40 %).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Normal LV systolic function with mild hypokinesis of the inferior at the base and apex.
Cath showed severe three vessel coronary artery disease and a IABP was placed.
Later he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without complications.
Also on post-op day one he had episode of rate controlled atrial fibrillation which was appropriately treated with beta blockers.
He was started on diuretics and diuresised for his preoperative weight.
