Multiple overlying EKG wires and external pacer wires are noted.
There is cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion compatible with congestive heart failure.
No large pleural effusions or pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION: Mild congestive heart failure.
TTE ([**2192-1-31**]) The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 59 M with hx of CHF, atrial fibrillation, NIDDM and schizophrenia presents with SOB at rest.
# CHF, Predominantly Diastolic with mild systolic dysfunction: Patient's history of progressive DOE to SOB at rest in the absence of chest pressure/pain in the setting of severe dietary indiscretion and missed lasix [**Month/Day/Year 4319**] is strongly suspicious for CHF exacerbation.
A history of depressed EF in [**2184**] indicates a systolic failure.
# Chronic Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: Patient with hx of Afib, likely related to CHF and enlarged left atrium, but also possible is OSA, hyperthyroidism or less likely, ischemia.
However, patient has a history of "coumadin intolerance".
On discussing with his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] appears that the reason he was not able to tolerate coumadin was due to over-sensitivity to coumadin and was supratherapeutic on coumadin.
ACEI was also started due to systolic heart failure.
LFT showed mildly elevated ALT: 58 and AST: 63, Alk phos and bilirubin were within normal range.
Possibly related to mild iron deficiency (recently) but also possibly a mild hemoglobinopathy.
2) Dietary Indiscretion - reinforce healthy diet, review low/high salt foods for repetition 3) Hypertension and Rate control - we made changes to these meds (metoprolol, lisinopril) and restarted digoxin.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on Chronic Diastolic congestive heart failure Diabetes Mellitus Hypertension Atrial fibrillation Schizophrenia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You had an exacerbation of your congestive heart failure because you stopped taking some medicines at home and because of a high salt diet.
Call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if your wieght increases more than 3 pounds in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days.
