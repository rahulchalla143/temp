HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80 year old the evening of [**2184-1-14**], when the patient had acute onset of right sided weakness during a card game.
He slumped over in his chair at the table and had no loss of consciousness, but was not able to speak afterwards.
Paramedics were called and the patient was brought to [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Department where on Head CT showed no hypodensity and no evidence of any hemorrhage.
He was considered to be a TPA candidate and had no contraindications.
The patient received TPA approximately one hour and forty minutes after onset of symptoms and was afterwards monitored in the unit.
The patient's post TPA course was significant for agitation with the patient receiving 19 mg of Lopressor and 10 mg of Ativan in the Emergency Department for blood pressure and agitation control.
The patient was monitored in the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit for post TPA monitoring for any evidence of hemorrhage.
The patient's agitation continued with some alteration in mental status.
An electroencephalogram was performed which showed diffuse swelling though no epileptiform activity.
A transthoracic echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 30 to 40% and no evidence of any cardiac etiology of his stroke.
Magnetic resonance scan was performed which showed an area of restricted diffusion in the left basal ganglia and insular cortex, otherwise no structural abnormality.
Speech and Swallow was consulted which recommended a regular diet for the patient as well as further speech therapy secondary to mild dysarthria.
Cardiac examination reveals a regular rate and rhythm with no murmur.
On neurological examination, the patient is awake and alert, in no acute distress.
Extraocular movements are intact with no nystagmus present.
On motor examination, the patient has full strength on the left side and mild 4+ out of 5 weakness on the right in an upper motor neuron distribution.
The patient has mildly slow rapid alternating movements and finger-nose-finger though steady and accurate.
The patient's gait is significant for mild unsteadiness.
