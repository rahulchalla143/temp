Admission Date:  [**2102-12-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2103-1-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2030-9-29**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**] Chief Complaint: worsening shortness of breath, recurrent pericardial effusion found on routine echo  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardial window ([**2102-12-28**])   History of Present Illness: 72M with PMH of DM, AFib on coumadin, and RA complicated by pericardial effusion and tamponade in [**5-6**], transferred from [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] for further evaluation and management of recurrent pericardial effusion and tamponade seen on routine repeat echo.
Patient had past admission on [**5-5**]/09 for fatigue, edema, and decreased exercise tolerance.
Routine follow-up TTE today at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] showed a small to moderate mainly anterior pericardial effusion with diastolic right ventricular collapse suggestive of tamponade.
HR 101 without intervention.
CXR showed only bibasilar linear atelectasis.
Reports having some shortness of breath, but is at his baseline due to his COPD.
Usually takes Tylenol for pain control.
- COPD   Social History: Retired.
Sclera anicteric.
PERRL, EOMI, MMM CV: RRR, S1S2, no murmurs, rubs.
Slightly distant heart sounds LUNGS: Diffuse rhonchi, good air movement, resp unlabored ABD: Obese, soft, NT, ND, no HSM or tenderness EXT: WWP, 2+ radial and DP pulses.
1+ LE edema b/l SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
A small to moderate mainly anterior pericardial effusion is present with diastolic right ventricular collapse suggestive of tamponade.
Additional In-house Read: Small amount of pericardial fluid and no evidence of RV diastolic collapse.
ECHO [**2102-12-30**] GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - bandages, defibrillator pads or electrodes.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
There is again seen some streaky densities at the bases most consistent with subsegmental atelectasis which is unchanged.
The upper lung fields are clear without focal consolidation or signs of overt pulmonary edema.
Linear opacities within both lung bases are compatible with linear atelectasis.
No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.
No acute skeletal abnormalities are seen.
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise visualized.
CXR [**2103-1-1**] IMPRESSION: Heterogeneous opacification at both lung bases has improved since [**12-30**], probably atelectasis.
On the left, it is conceivable that pneumonia was present and is rapidly clearing, but there is no new or worsening consolidation.
There is no pulmonary edema, pleural effusion or mediastinal widening.
Heart size is normal  Brief Hospital Course: 72M with PMH of DM, AFib on coumadin, and RA complicated by pericardial effusion and tamponade in [**5-6**], presents with recurrent pericardial effusion concerning of tamponade and complaints of some progressive shortness of breath.
Pericardial effusion - patient has had history of pericardial effusion in the past, thought to be a complicaton of RA.
Had a pericardiocentesis with drain placement in 5/[**2101**].
Initially had methotrexate discontinued for concerns of worsening pericardial effusion, but was restarted back on it in [**Month (only) 205**] when patient did not tolerate Humira well.
His echo read done at [**Location (un) 620**] showed a small to moderate mainly anterior pericardial effusion with evidence of diastolic right ventricular collapse suggestive of tamponade.
An additional read done by cardiology service here showed small amount of fluid with no evidence of RV diastolic collapse.
Patient was evaluated by thoracic surgery for pericardial window.
Procedure was performed on [**2102-12-28**] with drainage of only 80cc of fluid and was complicated by afib with RVR.
The drainage tube was subsequently removed and he is being followed with serial imaging which at the time of discharge showed a smaller pericardial effusion on echo and only atelectasis on CXR.
Biopsy from pericardial window showed unremarkable cartilage and skeletal muscle and fragments of pericardium with chronic inflammation and fibrin deposition.
HTN - patient was continued on home dosage of metoprolol, furosemide, and spironolactone during admission.
Valsartan was substituted for his home dose of olmesartan during admission, but patient was switched back to olmesartan on discharge.
# Anemia: he was found to have a microcytic anemia consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Hyperlipidemia - patient was continued on home regimen of pravastatin .
Rheumatoid Arthritis - patient's home regimen of methotrexate was held for pericardial effusion.
Was restarted on discharge after his pericardial window procedure.
COPD - currently at baseline, patient was in no respiratory distress.
DM - patient was continued on his home regimen of insulin as well as regular insulin sliding scale.
Glaucoma - patient was continued on prednisolone drop to left eye and artificial tears  Medications on Admission: ASA 81 Warfarin 3 mg daily Pravastatin 20 mg daily Benicar 20 mg daily Metoprolol tartrate 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] Furosemide 60mg QAM, 40mg QPM Spironolactone 25 mg daily Potassium chloride 10 mEq daily NPH insulin 34 units qAM, 32 units qPM Regular insulin 16 units qAM, 17 units qPM Symbicort 160/4.5 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **] Spiriva 18mcg 1 puff daily Omeprazole 20 daily Folic Acid 1 mg daily Prednisone 7.5mg daily Methotrexate 6 tablets of 2.5 mg once weekly qTues Prednisolone drops left eye qHS Aritificial Tears PRN  Discharge Medications: 1.

During this admission, we reviewed the echocardiogram that was performed at [**Location (un) 620**] and found that while there is some fluid present, it is not causing any tamponade of your heart.
A pericardial window was performed by thoracic surgery to help drain the fluid around your heart and prevent future reaccumulation.
If you experience any chest pain, worsening shortness of breath, or any other worrisome symptoms, please return to the emergency room  Followup Instructions: #1.MD: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1026**] [**Name (STitle) 1016**] Specialty: Cardiology Date/ Time: [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**1-5**] at 10:00am Location: [**Street Address(2) **], [**Location (un) 620**], [**Numeric Identifier 3002**] Phone number: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 8937**] .
