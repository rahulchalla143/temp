Admission Date:  [**2177-12-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-1-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2106-8-2**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Heparin Agents / Morphine / Tylenol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: CC: pain control, [**First Name3 (LF) **] hypotension   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: right IJ CVL placement PICC placement  History of Present Illness: 71 y.o.
female with left tib/fib fracture recently admitted to MICU Green for pain control in the setting of hypotension necessitating Dopamine, later found to have an Enterobacter UTI treated with Meropenem and subsequently called out to the floor upon resolution of hypotension who is now being transferred back for an acute change in mental status.
Of note, she had gotten Dilaudid in the AM for pain control and had undergone regularly scheduled dialysis with no complications.
At the time of the acute change in mental status, a head CT was performed which was normal.
Given underlying acid-base disturbance in the setting of mental status changes, she was transferred to the ICU for further management.
In the MICU, she continued to be hypotensive, CTA negative for PE, Urine + enterococcus and started on Meropenem.
She did have a hct drop (see below) but heme/onc felt this was not hemolysis and there was no active bleeding but hemoccult + stools.
Currently, patient reports some leg pain at fracture site but otherwise feeling well.
She denies f/c, no dizzyness, no dysphagia, no chest pain, no SOB, no cough, no [**Last Name (un) 103**] pain, [**Last Name (un) 103**] girth slightly increased, no dysuria, no hematuria.
She has loose stool with copper tinge, no melena, no nausea/vomiting.
Past Medical History: - VRE UTI (IV Daptomycin) [**2177-12-6**] - admission [**Date range (1) 40794**]/07 for altered ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] hypotension - Hepatic encephalopathy: multiple episodes s/p lactulose non-compliance - Portal vein thrombosis [**5-10**] but not anticoag for h/o GIB - Type 2 diabetes.
- End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis M/W/F - Cirrhosis [**3-7**] NASH and acetaminophen toxicity.
- Gastric angioectasia with h/o GI bleeding in 4/[**2177**].
- Diastolic CHF.
Mod MR and long mitral deceleration time - ?right sided pleural effusion: diagnosed on U/S [**11/2176**], CXR showed a small effusion - stayed stable in subsequent imaging.
- History of seizure disorder, on [**Year (4 digits) 13401**].
- History of infection in the left knee.
- History of MRSA and Clostridium difficile and VRE.
- History of gram-positive rod bacteremia in 4/[**2177**].
- Status post ORIF of the left distal femur fracture in 12/[**2175**].
JVP flat CARDS: III/VI systolic M w radiation to axilla.
RRR, no heave LUNGS: decreased BS at right base, otherwise clear, no wheeze ABD: obese, no caput, BS+ NT ND soft, no rebound.
no obvious fluid wave.
no shifting dullness SKIN: erythematous plaques under left breast and panus.
ecchymotic lesions on right and left upper ex.
GUAIAC: NEG brown stool   Pertinent Results: EKG: sinus brady, rate 50, left anterior fasc block, RBBB pattern, QTc 535, TW flattening diffusely, no other ST-T changes.
CXR: Stable right pleural effusion and a lower lobe opacity which may reflect effusion/atelectasis .
Pelvis and ankle: no fracture .
Left Leg: Acute fracture involving the proximal tibia and fibula metaphysis with approximately 6 mm medial displacement of the distal fracture fragment .
RUQ U/S Note is made that this is a difficult study due to the patient's body habitus.
The liver has a coarse echotexture appearance, but there are no lesions identified.
There is no biliary dilatation and the common duct measures 0.5 cm.
There is no ascites identified.
There is interval resolution of pulmonary congestion and improvement in right pleural effusion which is now small-to-moderate.
Right lower lung opacities persist likely representing atelectasis.
Streaky atelectasis persists in the left mid and lower lung.
Otherwise no new pulmonary infiltrates are identified.
No pneumothorax is identified.
female with multiple medical problems, namely cirrhosis and current ESBL UTI who was transferred to the MICU for change in mental status.
MS: delirium intermittently thought initially [**3-7**] hepatic encephalopathy vs infection vs medications.
In the ICU, she was hypotensive requiring pressors (see below).
She initially refused lactulose but once she took it, started having BMs and improved MS.  She was transferred from MICU to the floor and was stable for several days.
ABG revealed mild hypercapnea but her sx improved rapidly without much intervention.
We felt this was [**3-7**] dilaudid in setting of pt with poor baseline ms (hepatic enceph) as well as urosepsis.
She did have a hct drop (see below) but heme/onc felt this was not hemolysis and there was no active bleeding.
Her slightly low BP was attributed to diarrhea and the patient responded to gentle IVF boluses.
HEME POSITIVE STOOLS: The patient has history of upper GI bleeds and has known gastric angioectasia and grade I varices of esophagus.
She continued to have maroon-colored stools this hospitalization but she remained asymptomatic and her hematocrit was stable.
Her propranolol has been held due to low blood pressures.
Cirrhosis: Patient appeared encephalopathic on presentation but improved throught her stay and was oriented and interactive.
Adrenal Insufficiency: Patient  mildly abnormal stim test while hypotensive and received steroids which were rapidly tapered.
CHF: History of diastolic dysfunction with significant edema on exam after aggressive hydration.
Diarrhea: The patient had multiple episodes of diarrhea with slightly low BP.
Her diarrhea was mostly likely secondary to lactulose and her dose was decreased, with decreasing bowel movements.
