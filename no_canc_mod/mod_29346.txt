Overnight she became febrile to 102.3, increasingly tachycardic to 125, and hypotensive to 80 systolic.
Stress dose steroids were planned for a 7 day course, antibiotics were peeled back to levofloxacin alone, and a R hip film revealed no loosening nor inflammation.
On the floor the patient remained stable hemodynamically without recurrent fever and was stable for transfer back to [**Hospital1 **] 4.
Hypotension: Patient presented after episode of hypotension and syncope on [**Hospital1 **] 5.
Initially it was felt that this was a result of poor PO intake.
She was afebrile without orthostatic vital signs nor hypotension.
She had no symptoms of infectious source, normal UA, normal chest xray, and no symptoms nor signs of injury after her fall with syncope.
Subsequently overnight, she developed a fever to 102.3 and recurrent hypotension in the setting of fevers and tachycardia that was concerning for an infectious source.
She still had no localizing signs of infection and culture data was negative to be negative.
RUQ US was ordered and returned without signs of infection later.
She had cultures drawn, was given tylenol (tylenol screen prior to this dose was negative, as was a urine tox), was started on levofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin to cover emperically for hospital aquired pneumonia, GI sources, and a potential hip infection.
In the ICU she also received an echo that revealed normal function and little valvular disease (she has two loud systolic murmurs on exam), and a hip film revealing no inflammation nor loosening.
The patient was planned for a 7 day course of stress dose steroids followed by a return to her basal predinisone/fludrocortisone dose.
Elevated LFTs: LFTs wre elevated at presentation.
Initially the differential was thought to include shock liver from hypotension, hepatitis, cholangitis or choledocholithiasis.
Hepatitis serologies were negative and the pt was eventually felt to have had shock liver from her hypotensive episode as the transaminitis resolved over time.
These were initially continued as above and later, when she became hypotensive and febrile, stress dose steroids were started and planned for a 7 day course followed by a return to her prior dose of prednisone.
On the day of discharge her glargine was decreased by one unit because her glucose remained somewhat low in the mornings.
A R hip film was negative for pathology or failure of her hip replacement.
Pain was controlled with tylenol and the pt was reassured.
The pt uses a wheelchair often at baseline due to pain from arthritis.
Depression:  The pt was being treated at [**Hospital1 **] 4 for suicidal ideation and a suicide attempt on original admission with tylenol and oxycodone.
She remained very depressed at her inpatient admission and refractory to treatment.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] 4  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypotension Early Sepsis Adrenal Insufficiency Diabetes I Hypocalcemia (Hypoparathyroidism) Depression Transaminitis   Discharge Condition: Stable vitals, depressed.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a low blood pressure and developed a fever.
