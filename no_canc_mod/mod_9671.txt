He was previously admitted to the [**Hospital1 190**] from [**5-21**] to [**5-24**] with a gastrointestinal bleed after transfer from an outside hospital.
The patient then presented via ambulance on [**5-27**] with vomiting and melena.
The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and underwent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt on [**5-31**] without complications initially.
However, the next day the patient became febrile with a temperature maximum of 103.
The patient's liver function tests continued to rise, and a computerized axial tomography a right hepatic lobe infarction.
Over the next two days, the patient developed lethargy and fatigue and stated that he did take all his medications.
He also noted that he had melanotic stools and subsequently presented to the Emergency Department.
Alcoholic cirrhosis; hepatitis C induced.
The patient has a history of portal hypertension.
As mentioned previously, the patient was admitted on [**2166-5-27**] and underwent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt on [**5-31**] which was complicated by localized hepatic infarction and was subsequently admitted on [**6-8**].
The patient has a history of hepatitis C virus.
The patient has a history of gastritis and duodenitis by esophagogastroduodenoscopy in [**2165-7-28**].
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
[**Name (NI) **] has a history of arrests and [**Last Name (un) 20934**].
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination on admission revealed vital signs with a temperature of 97.2, blood pressure was 119/60, heart rate was 100, respiratory rate was 18, and oxygen saturation was 985 on room air.
Neck examination revealed no jugular venous distention.
No carotid bruits.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Soft and nontender with good bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed 1+ lower extremity edema bilaterally.
The patient had somewhat slurred speech.
The patient had positive asterixis.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  As mentioned above, the patient was readmitted on [**6-8**] with melena, a drop in hematocrit, and lethargy.
GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:   The patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy that showed a nonbleeding ulcer.
The patient had a Doppler ultrasound showing reversible flow in the left portal vein, and decreased transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt velocities, and worsening ascites; consistent with decreased transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt patency.
The patient subsequently underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt revision on [**2166-6-10**] during which the patient was found to have a spontaneous splenorenal shunt stealing blood flow from the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.
However, an ultrasound from [**6-11**] showed slowed flow through the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.
The repeat ultrasound showed patent forward flow and increased transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt velocity; consistent with a patent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.
The patient did not show any signs of return of encephalopathy or fluid overload.
From a cirrhosis point of view, the patient had a successful transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt revision; status post angioplasty of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt and coiling of spontaneous splenorenal shunt.
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  Anemia and thrombocytopenia were stable.
The patient did not show any evidence of active bleed.
The thrombocytopenia was likely secondary to splenic sequestration and was stable.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was placed on ciprofloxacin 500 mg by mouth every day for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis.
RENAL ISSUES:  Hyponatremia was stable; most likely secondary to end-stage liver disease/ascites/total body sodium overload.
Decreased patency of original transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt; status post revision with good flow.
