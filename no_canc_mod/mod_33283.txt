He was brought into the [**Hospital1 18**] ER where because of continued generalized seizures involving upper and lower extremity stiffening and was given a total of 10 mg of Ativan before being intubated to protect his airway and started on a Propofol drip.
Patient spiked a temperature to 103.2 and thus empiric Vancomcyin, Ceftriaxone, Acyclovir were started prior to performing an LP which was unremarkable for signs of infection.
Patient was seen by neurology who felt that seizures were likely due to alcohol withdrawal vs. head trauma.
Approx [**2095**]: hit by a car > frequent generalized complex seizures afterwards.
[**2130**]: Fall > subdural and epidural hematoma/non-displaced fracture of rt parietal bone > craniotomy x 2.
**Additionally, pt states he has been hit in the head during fights and hit his head after being struck by cars "many, many times."
Hx of withdrawal seizures.
Previous EEG: [**2128**]: routine study (during sleep): no spikes or sharp waves.
No organized electrographis seizure activity.
EEG: [**2130**]: AbnL: generalized slowing, focal slowing left frontocentral regions with freq sharp waves but no def electrographic seizure activity was seen.
[**6-5**] General: Sedated, intubated, NAD, unresponsive to verbal stimuli, in neck hard collar HEENT: Small swellings on left forehead; PEERLA Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops; Seemingly absent sternum with skin retraction with coughing Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: 2+ DTRs bilaterally in biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patella.
Upgoing toes bilaterally (unchanged from neuro exam in ED and felt to be non-specific in the setting of current encephalopathy).
Areas of hypodensity in the left frontal and left temporal lobe, of uncertain chronicity, could be due to infarction, prior or recent trauma, or post-surgical.
Focal area of hyperdensity in the left frontal lobe, could be due to cortical contusion, or post-surgical.
Bilateral post-surgical craniotomies.
Prominence of ventricles and sulci.
Mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus, and ethmoid air cells.
No definite traumatic changes seen in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.
male with a history of multiple traumatic brain injuries, seizures and alcohol abuse, found down by [**Location (un) 86**] police smelling of alcohol and subsequently seizing and febrile, intubated s/p a MICU stay, extubated, sent to the floor with uptitration of keppra to 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **].
# Seizures: Differential mostly concerned with alcohol withdrawal vs. traumatic brain injury.
Head CT shows prior craniotomy as well as hypodense lesions of unclear chronicity, which may or may not be contributing.
He was initially placed on acyclovir but that antiviral was discontinued when his initial LP demonstrated no growth.
# Alcohol Withdrawal: Suspected based on low alcohol level in a patient who chronically drinks with seizures seen in ED.
# Fever: No localizing signs/symptoms of infection besides CNS, which has been ruled out with head CT and negative LP.
Culture data from LP, blood, urine all negative or preliminarily showing no growth.
# Transaminitis.
LFTs trending down although are persistently elevated and should be followed up as an outpatient.
The patient should have chronic follow up for both his alcohol abuse and for evaluation of his degree of liver dysfunction/inflammation/or fibrosis.
# Elevated LDH.
Should be rechecked as an outpatient to ensure no pathological etiology.
Patient truly needs to follow up with neurology and establish a primary care provider to allow for follow up and management of his chronic medical problems and alcohol abuse.
