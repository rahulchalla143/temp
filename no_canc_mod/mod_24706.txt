Outside hospital CT reportedly show bilateral ground-glass opacity, predominating in the lower lobes.
He subsequently had a right wedge resection of the right lower lobe, with pathology consistent with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP).
Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained in standard 5 mm and 1.25 mm thin slices for evaluation.
There are diffuse ground-glass opacities throughout the lungs fields, right worse than left, and predominantly in the right lower lobe.
A curvilinear density in the right base represents a suture line compatible with the documented RLL VATS surgery.
Several peripheral small pulmonary nodules are noted in the right lung, two in the right middle lobe both measure 6 mm (image 4:125), and one in the right upper lobe measures 6 mm (image 3:32).
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
A small thymic remnant is noted.
Non-IV contrast limits full evaluation of the great mediastinal vessels, but vascular variant is noted, including a right-sided aortic arch and a right-sided descending aorta.
There are separate aortic origins for the right subclavian and right internal carotid artery.
There is an aberrant left subclavian artery.
Patulous appearance of the upper esophagus is suggestive of dysphagia lusoria secondary to the vascular anomaly.
There is no gross mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy.
There is a right hilar lymph node, measuring 19 x 14 mm (image 2:35), possibly reactive to the underlying right lung disease.
The distal trachea is noted with mild AP diameter narrowing just proximal to the carina, but the tracheobronchial tree is otherwise patent.
The study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis, but no gross abnormality is noted.
BONE WINDOW: No suspicious lytic was sclerotic lesion is noted.
Diffuse ground-glass patchy opacities, right worse than left, and with predominance in the right lower lobe.
Evidence of prior right lower lobe VATS surgery.
The constellation of findings is compatible with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.
Differential diagnosis consideration also includes infection, alveolar hemorrhage, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and less likely asymmetric pulmonary edema.
Small peripheral pulmonary nodules in the right lung.
Aortic variant including a right-sided aortic arch and right-sided descending aorta, aberrant left subclavian artery, and separate origins of the right common carotid and subclavian arteries.
Patulous upper esophagus suggestive of dysphagia lusoria.
Mild decrease of the AP diameter of the distal trachea near the carina.
The current study demonstrates interval increase in widespread parenchymal opacities bilaterally, right more than left, which might be due to the recent bronchopulmonary lavage.
[**2162-4-8**]: Resolution of right lung opacification with new severe diffuse opacification of the left lung and a left mainstem bronchial tube, which may represent a lavage tube.
No pneumothorax.
[**2162-4-9**]: Respiratory motion obscures pulmonary detail, but consolidation in the right lower lung may have improved slightly, but has worsened appreciably in the left lung, now densely consolidated, a progressive change since [**4-7**].The volume of the accompanying left pleural effusion is indeterminate, but could be very small.
Heart is mildly enlarged but unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
About the time this radiograph was officially interpreted, a subsequent study 7:35 a.m. on [**4-10**] showed dramatic clearing of left upper lobe consolidation, an improvement in residual basilar involvement.
Unchanged minimal bilateral basal opacities, that has substantially improved in the retrocardiac lung areas.
No evidence of newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities.
Brief Hospital Course: 25 y/o M with biopsy-proven pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, s/p bilateral whole lung lavages.
Developed hypoxia and unsuccessful attempts to retrieve fluid during left-sided lavage.
About 1 liter of normal saline was not retrieved from lung during left lung lavage and patient developed pulmonary edema on chest x-ray, likely representing interstitial diffusion of lavage fluid.
He became hypoxic to 80s in OR and was intubated on [**4-9**].
# Fevers: Spiked fevers after lavage which were felt to be consistent with a post-lavage fever.
Oxygen Continue using your home oxygen as needed   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis  Secondary: Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for further treatment of your lung disease, called "pulmonary alveolar proteinosis."
The pulmonary doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 44669**] your lungs out with saline to get rid of the extra material in your lungs.
Your oxygen requirement decreased daily.
Upon discharge, you were hemodynamically stable, afebrile and comfortable.
Please resume your medications as prescribed by your outpatient providers  If you develop fevers or shortness of breath, please contact your primary care physician or go to the emergency department immediately.
