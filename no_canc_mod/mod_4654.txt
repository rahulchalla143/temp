Approximately one to two days prior to admission, he developed a fever to 104.0 F., tachycardia with heart rate to the 150s and hypotension with systolic blood pressure to the 60s.
On admission, he was found to have an elevated creatinine of 2.7 with a prior baseline as high as 1.6.
Initial infectious work-up was positive for urinalysis with over 50 white blood cells and he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for suspected urosepsis.
Bilateral fibrothoraxes status post right lung and diaphragm decortication and tracheostomy placement in [**Month (only) 958**] of this year.
History of a Roux-en-Y reconstruction after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in [**2139-4-2**].
History of knee replacement and chronic leg pain.
Diabetes mellitus.
Chronic anemia.
Diabetic neuropathy.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy with a history of prostatitis.
Abdomen had positive bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended, no rebound noted.
Extremities with trace lower extremity edema bilaterally.
Skin with no obvious rashes.
Urinalysis was notable for cloudy urine, negative nitrite, moderate leukocyte esterase, more than 50 red blood cells, more than 50 white blood cells with moderate bacteria, zero to two epithelials.
Chest x-ray showing stable postoperative changes; small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
Previous cardiac catheterization in [**2139-6-2**] showing clean coronaries except for mild coronary artery disease in left circumflex of 30 to 40% lesion.
SEPSIS:  With initial positive urinalysis and negative chest x-ray, the patient was thought to be in urosepsis.
He was initially febrile in the Emergency Department and subsequently became hypothermic.
After the patient's blood pressure stabilized, he became afebrile and his urine culture returned as infective pseudomonas, he was taken off steroids and placed on Zosyn for pseudomonas coverage.
As he became hemodynamically stable throughout the rest of his hospital course, his central access was discontinued as well as his arterial line.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  He had a presumed urine infection with pseudomonas that was resistant to fluoroquinolones.
BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY:  The patient has had a Foley catheter in place for at least one to two months because of a history of benign prostatic hypertrophy and urinary retention.
A Foley catheter was continued during his inpatient hospital stay but he will likely need an outpatient urology evaluation and / or possible transurethral resection of the prostate procedure as indwelling Foley catheter may increase his risk for recurrent urinary tract infections and / or future episodes of urosepsis.
PULMONARY:  The patient was continued on the ventilator intermittently as he had done previously and he was not thought to have a primary pulmonary process as the cause of this admission.
Because of air leak around the cuff of his tracheostomy, his tracheostomy was changed to a Portex #7.
He did well on intermittent pressure support and no vent changes were made.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had initial elevated troponin of 0.26 in the setting of hypotension and acute renal failure.
Given the clinical circumstance, his elevated troponin was thought to be due to demand ischemia.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  His creatinine was elevated up to 2.7 on admission thought to be due to his sepsis and decreased intervascular volume.
The patient had minimal bleeding around the site of the PEG placement so his aspirin dose was lowered from 325 mg to 81 mg which is a prophylactic dose.
DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient had some elevated glucose while on steroids.
He was afebrile with stable hemodynamics and doing well on a ventilator.
He was felt to be safe for discharge to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation for continuation of his ventilatory wean and for continued intravenous antibiotic therapy.
Urosepsis with pseudomonas urinary tract infection.
Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Acute renal failure, now resolved.
Diabetes mellitus.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
He was told that if he developed any recurrent fevers or chills, episodes of nausea, lightheadedness, confusion or any other concerning symptoms whatsoever, that he should seek immediate medical attention.
