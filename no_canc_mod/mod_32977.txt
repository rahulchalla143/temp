Per report, pt had been having mild respiratory complaints recently.
Mother notes that the patient complained of lip and eye swelling on Friday and was seen at [**Hospital **] hospital.
At [**Hospital1 **], she was noted to have LE edema and hypoxia and so was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
In the ED, her O2 sat was normal, workup was only notable for 3+ LE edema and elevated bicarb.
Exam was only notable for intermittent agitation, no respiratory distress, lungs clear, mild LE swelling.
No leukocytosis.
Patient was given neb with minimal effect.
On the floor, she has no complaints.
Formerly lived in the downstairs apartment of her mother's house.
Family History: Father with bipolar disorder.

# Hypoxia: Patient presented with significant hypoxia with oxygen saturations occasionally falling into the 60s on room air.
Etiology of hypoxia appeared to be multifactorial.
After sedating psychiatric medications were held her hypoxia and hypercarbia mildly improved and her symptoms resolved.
Echo with bubble study was performed that ruled out any septal defects or cardiac malformations that could be causing a shunt.
EKG was without ischemic changes, cardiac enzymes were negative and telemetry was without events.
Echo and chest x-ray showed no evidence of pulmonary effusion or CHF.
She also had diminished diffusion capacity on PFTs but without clear evidence of interstitial edema or fibrosis on imaging.
She had no fever or leukocytosis during admission but infiltrate on CT chest suggested infectious etiology so patient was treated with a 5 day course of levaquin.
They determined that the patient likely has a chronic hypoventilation syndrome.
This hypoventilation in setting of underlying COPD, sedation, obesity, and pneumonia is likely responsible for this patient's hypoxia and hypercarbia on admission.
Would strongly consider outpatient sleep study to evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea.
Patient has a BMI of 30 but would likely benefit from weight loss.
# Hypercarbia: Patient presented with diminished breath sounds and rapid respiratory rate exacerbating likely chronic hypoventilation.
With smoking history, paraseptal emphysema on CT, and PFTs support diagnosis of COPD.
Patient did not appear to have contributory muscular weakness on exam.
# Bipolar/Schizoaffective Disorder: Known history of bipolar and schizoaffective disorder would give patient limited reserve in the setting of hypoxia, hypercarbia, and hospitalization in an unfamiliar setting.
Restarted outpatient psychiatric medications with exception of depakote and clonazepam and minimized sedating medications.
She was very cooperative with limited evidence of psychosis.
There remained evidence of old, dead nits which would require intensive fine-tooth combing and likely further oil therapies to have them removed.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: Two (2) Puff Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for wheezing.
Perphenazine 8 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for agitation.
Supplemental Oxygen For treatment of chronic hypoxia please continue to use supplemental oxygen at night via face mask or nasal cannula.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO TIDprn as needed for anxiety, agitation.
Hypoxia 2.
Pediculosis  Secondary Diagnosis Schizoaffective disorder Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile, oxygen saturations greater than 90% on room air when awake.
This was most likely from a variety of causes, including side effects from your medications which were making you sleep a lot, from changes to your lungs because of your smoking history, from not taking deep breaths, and from a lung infection called pneumonia.
Please return to the ER or call your primary care doctor if you develop shortness of breath, chest pain, increased leg swelling, lightheadedness, dizziness, fever, chills, or any other concerning symptoms.
