His shortness of breath started yesterday and persisted until today, noted by his wife as mostly tachypnea.
It is nonexertional in character and he describes a productive cough with yellow sputum, not necessarily different than his normal smoker's cough.
He never vomits while he is still laying down and does not ever remember choking on his own vomit or aspirating.
He is currently being worked up by GI for his recurrent vomiting, which has responded to ondansetron in the past, with a pending EGD to work up possible eosinophilic esophagitis.
Extensive workup for the cause consisted of an EGD that showed esophagitis with eosinophils and neutrophils.
Initial labs showed an elevated lactate to 6.8 that improved to 3.8 with 2L IVF.
WBC notable at 19.4 (slightly higher than his elevated baseline on prednisone) with normal differential.
For his dyspnea, an elevated D-dimer forced a CTA chest/abd, which did not show PE but did have multifocal small ground-glass opacities.
He was covered with levofloxacin and ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia, as there was no clear explanation for the elevated lactate.
He is not in any acute distress and appears quite comfortable.

[**2182-7-27**]: BCx pending  Brief Hospital Course: 47 year old male with ankylosing spondylitis on chronic prednisone + infliximab and recurrent vomiting of unknown etiology, presenting with new onset dyspnea and another recurrence of sudden onset vomiting.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Dyspnea:  The most likely scenario is an atypical pneumonia that may have precipitated dyspnea and productive cough in his relatively immunocompromised state.
Hospital-acquired infection is possible, but less likely given his last admission was nearly 1 month ago and he has been at home since then.
In the setting of chronic steroid use without prophylaxis and new ground-glass opacities (though subtle) on the CT chest, PCP was ruled out.
Pulmonary embolism ruled out by CTA and no other structural abnormalities noted (i.e.
He was given albuterol/ipratropium prn for wheezing.
# Corticosteroid-induced diabetes mellitus: On metformin at home, not requiring any oral hypoglycemics or insulin.
His glucose was elevated upon arrival to the ED and he was given a small amount of insulin SC for an elevated anion gap to 19, which quickly closed to 14 without a significant acidosis.
Unlikely to have represented DKA and ketones in the urine more likely secondary to starvation from recurrent vomiting.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # Ankylosing spondylitis:  Controlled on infliximab and daily prednisone which was continued as was calc/vit D  # Paroxysmal AF: Currently in sinus rhythm.
