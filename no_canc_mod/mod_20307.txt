Infant was born to a 28-year-old O-positive, gravida 3, para 1 now two living three female, whose pregnancy was notable for spontaneously occurring twin gestation.
Preterm labor and concerns for intrauterine growth restriction in this twin resulted in mother being admitted to the hospital from [**6-8**] through [**6-11**] with cramping and preterm labor.
She is also on Zantac for gastroesophageal reflux.
Cardiac:  Infant has had a soft murmur initially heard, but then subsequently was intermittently heard and then I am unable to appreciate the presence of this murmur currently.
