His initial creatinine was 15.3, his glucose was 162, and he had a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 24 (up from his baseline of 19, due to his chronic kidney disease).
He was given 2L IVF for hydration, and his anion gap closed to 20.
On the medicine floor he had worsening nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, his glucose rose to 305, his gap increased to 21 and his pH was 7.27.
He had an EKG that showed no ischemia, and morphine for pain.
The patient was refusing his calcium capsules because they were too big to swallow, and tried to order a pizza in instead of hospital food.
Following his HD session, he was seen by the medical team and advised to stay in the hospital for one more day to assess for an infection, given his overnight fever and recent initiation of hemodialysis.
He was advised to stay to ensure he remained afebrile for 24 hours.
Increased above baseline on presentation probably due to uremia in setting of dehydration.
Patient's anion gap decreased to baseline ~17, given patient's underlying end-stage renal disease/uremia.
Patient required resumption of insulin gtt briefly; he was resumed on insulin sliding scale and fixed dose, with Nutrition Consult and Social Work following for coping/management of his long-standing, complicated Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.
N/V/D, abdominal pain.
Given low grade fever and acute onset, most c/w viral gastroenteritis although possible that this was exacerbated by uremia.
Abdominal exam nonfocal but with tenderness initially that resolved.
Did have an episode of resumed, increased abdominal pain after consumption of KFC, likely due to brief opening of anion gap and underlying gastroparesis.
Mild elevation of LFTs gradually resolved.
Pt was already in end stage renal disease (stage 4) on admission.
In the setting of profuse nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, there was also likely a prerenal component to the bump in creatinine.
Initially on arrival to the MICU, hematocrit was 20, mildly below baseline of 25 and felt due to the combination of iron deficiency and CKD.
Patient did not have emesis or blood in his stools.
Poorly controlled, likely in the setting of initial acute discomfort and later due to volume overload in the setting of his ESRD and intravenous fluids for DKA.
As discussed above, in the setting of recent initiation of hemodialysis and pending blood cultures, the patient was advised to remain in the hospital to be sure he was afebrile for 24 hours, without signs or symptoms of infection, and that his blood cultures remained negative.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Viral Gastroenteritis Diabetic Ketoacidosis Diabetes Mellitus type 1 CKD stage V, requiring initiation of hemodialysis   Discharge Condition: The patient is leaving AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE given his recent fevers, pending blood cultures, and recent initiation of hemodialysis.
Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: *LEAVING AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE*  You were admitted to the hospital for nausea and vomiting.
While in the hospital, your sugars were elevated and you were found to have Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA).
However, you were not compliant with your diabetic diet and after eating fried chicken you redeveloped signs of DKA requiring a second insulin drip.
You developed further episodes of DKA during your hospitalization and each required insulin drip in the intensive care unit.
Given your recent initiation of hemodialysis and lengthy hospital course, we advise you to remain in the hospital while we await the results of these cultures.
As you have decided to leave, it will be AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE as we strongly believe that you should continue to be evaluated for signs and potential sources of infection given your recent fevers.
We want to ensure that you did not have an active infection and do not have fevers over the next 24 hours.
