He states no increase in pain during this time.
Patient reports increase in activity with physical therapy on [**2120-3-12**], leading to some increased diffuse knee pain that completely resolved at rest.
He denies any recent fevers, chills, or diaphoresis.
He notes development of significant knee swelling which is similar to in the past.
His recent medical course is notable for septic left TKA and left shoulder s/p I&D on [**2-25**] and [**2-26**].

IMAGING: [**2120-3-12**] Knee xray: No radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis.
Status post total knee arthroplasty without evidence of hardware failure.
[**2120-3-12**] [**Month/Day/Year **] U/S: No left lower extremity DVT.
[**2120-3-15**] Knee xray: The left knee arthroplasty has been removed and there is a methyl methacrylate spacer in the knee joint.
Smooth periosteal reaction about the distal shaft of the femur is unchanged and likely reactive to the recent infection.
HPOA could have a similar appearance and note is made of the recent chest radiograph dated [**2120-4-4**].
Expected post surgical changes including soft tissue swelling as well as a surgical drain are noted.
Mild multifocal pneumonia.
No pulmonary emboli.
Possible pulmonary hypertension.
Mild dependent atelectasis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Severe ascites.
[**2120-3-26**] CT Chest w/o con: Newly occurred massive consolidations and opacities, predominating in the upper lobes but also visualized in the peribronchial areas of the middle lobe and both lower lobes.
Newly appeared moderate right pleural effusion, increased left pleural effusion.
Numerous mucus accumulations in the tracheobronchial tree.
Mild decrease in extent of the pre-existing ascites.
Extensive ascites with mesenteric edema and anasarca, findings consistent with decompensated cirrhosis.
No discrete loculated fluid collection to suggest abscess, though evaluation is limited due to the free fluid and non-contrast technique.
Multifocal consolidations within the lung bases consistent with pneumonia.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
No definite evidence of colitis, though evaluation is limited due to extensive free fluid and non-contrast technique.
[**2120-4-2**] CT Head w/o con: Moderately motion limited study without evidence of an acute intracranial process.
[**2120-4-3**] Bilateral UE U/S: Occlusion of the distal segment of the right radial artery, without evidence of flow.
Brief Hospital Course: 54 year old man with EtOH cirrhosis, recent MSSA bacteremia with left septic prosthetic knee and left septic shoulder, initially admitted to the ortho service with increased drainage from the left knee, s/p L TKA resection, with course complicated by development of hypoxemic respiratory distress requiring transfer to the MICU.
The patient was extubated and pain was controlled with morphine.
# HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: On [**3-18**], patient became hypoxic with sat of 90% on 6L NC.
CTA negative for PE, but showed multifocal PNA.
Was concern patient may have aspirated in setting of AMS [**2-14**] hepatic encephalopathy, and also concern for volume overload in setting of multiple recent transfusions given elevated JVP.
Restrictive physiology from worsening ascites and abdominal distension was also felt to be contributing, though diuresis initially limited secondary to [**Last Name (un) **].
Had repeat CT chest, which showed worsening of multifocal PNA with bilateral patchy consolidations.
Sputum cultures sent, but only positive for rare yeast, and all blood cultures remained negative.
Ongoing respiratory distress again thought to be multifactorial from PNA, restriction from significant ascites, and volume overload in setting of repeated transfusions and worsening renal function with near anuria.
Patient's vent settings were changed from assist control to pressure support, and patient did well, though extubation was limited by patient's mental status.
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: Patient initially with AMS secondary to hepatic encephalopathy prior to ICU transfer, in setting of refusing [**Month/Year (2) 89638**].
Had some improvement in MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 89638**] dosing increased, though developed increasing confusion in ICU most likely secondary to delirium in setting of post-op pain and infection.
Patient was intubated on [**3-25**] for return to OR, and given initial sedation with propofol, and later with fent/midaz, was difficult to fully assess mental status.
Was though to have persistent encephalopathy, and also AMS secondary to uremia in setting of worsening renal function.
CT head [**4-2**] was negative for acute intracranial process.
Hypotension felt to be multifactorial in setting of underlying cirrhosis, acute blood loss peri-operatively, infection, and sedation.
Patient had recurrent hypotension when starting on HD; was switched to CRRT and had arterial line placed for closer monitoring on [**4-3**].
Also received small fluid boluses as needed for recurrent hypotension.
Patient had h/o recent AIN from nafcillin, and urinalysis still revealed rare eosinophils.
However, was more concern for pre-renal azotemia/transient ischemia causing acute worsening of renal function.
Renal consulted, and felt presentation most c/w ischemic injury based on presence of granular casts and sheets of hyaline casts in urine.
Was some concern for HRS, given low urine Na, though patient was responsive to albumin challenge and maintained good urine output initially.
However, again developed worsening renal function with significant rise in Cr, and renal re-consulted on [**3-28**] and felt [**Last Name (un) **] secondary to ischemic ATN.
Urine output continued to decline, and patient became nearly anuric with ~100cc urine output daily.
Decreased urine output was also exacerbated by increased bladder pressures, noted to be as high as 28 in setting of worsening ascites and abdominal distension on [**3-31**].
Had repeat para [**3-31**] with 3L removed, and resultant decrease in bladder pressure to 12.
Given hypotension occurring during HD, but desire to remove volume given persistent respiratory distress, patient started on CRRT on [**4-2**] to allow removal of greater volume.
Was on daptomycin and cefazolin, which had been started for MSSA bacteremia and VRE bacteremia during previous admission.
All other cultures remained negative, and cipro later d/c'd as this was felt to be contaminant and not true infection by ID consulting team.
Patient's JP drain removed while patient in ICU, though patient continued to have oozing from left knee given underlying coagulopathy from his liver disease.
Patient transfused additional 2 units pRBCs in ICU, and also given vitamin K given elevated INR.
Fluid pocket felt to be hematoma and not infection, and cultures sent from OR [**3-25**] negative.
Patient continued on antibiotics throughout his hospital course (see below), though when antibiotic course for multifocal PNA completed on [**3-30**], patient switched back to cefazolin for planned 6 week course of treatment of L septic knee, scheduled to end [**4-27**].
# ETOH CIRRHOSIS: Patient with decompensated cirrhosis this admission.
Patient initially continued on home regimen of spironolactone and lasix, as well as [**Month/Day (4) 89638**], though spironolactone and lasix later stopped in setting of worsening renal function.
Had repeat paracentesis [**3-21**] with removal of 3L fluid, and another paracentesis on [**3-25**] which was also negative for SBP.
Dobhoff placed in OR on [**3-25**] for increased nutritional support, and patient continued on thiamine and folate.
# DVT: Patient found to have DVT in left gastrocnemius [**Last Name (un) **] via LENIs performed [**3-23**].
Given surgery and concern for ongoing blood loss post-operatively, patient could not be anticoagulated and therefore had IVC filter placed.
# RIGHT RADIAL ARTERY THROMBUS: Patient found to have clot in R radial artery on [**4-3**] ultrasound.
Patient did not have any arterial cannulation or ABGs obtained from right side.
# DIARRHEA: Patient noted to have increased stool output on [**3-23**], and which was felt to be multifactorial from increased [**Month/Year (2) 89638**] dosing and antibiotic course.
Several stool samples negative for C. diff, and flagyl eventually stopped [**3-29**] after C. diff PCR came back negative.
