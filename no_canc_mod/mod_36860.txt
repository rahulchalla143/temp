Admission Date:  [**2116-3-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2116-3-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2076-5-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Penicillins / Clarithromycin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: R sided weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Sinus surgery   History of Present Illness: 39F with a history of AIDS (CD4 113 [**2-25**], VL 109), Hep B, pancreatitis, candidiasis, HSV, pyelonephritis, gonorrhea, syphilis and cocaine abuse who presents with acute right sided weakness for one day.
Per report (compiled from the patient, her group home, and mother), the patient yesterday complained of R leg numbness/weakness and a mild headache.
She lay down and felt better but awoke at ~4am with an inability to ambulate [**12-20**] R leg weakness and slurred speech.
Of note, the patient reports intermittant R leg numbness over the past several months but the mother has noticed her daughter complain of bilateral LE symptoms for >1yr.
She does endorse some mild pressure type non-radiating chest pain in the ED today along with palpatations that had since resolved.
In the ED, the patient was noted to have a variable mental status and exam.
They observed discordant neurologic exam findings on the R compared to the L and a code stroke was called.
CT scan showed marked destruction of her sinuses c/w old surgical procedures but infectious cause could not be excluded.
No recent infarcts were seen on this scan.
Neurology evaluated the patient and felt her picture was more consistent with an infectious etiology but suggested an acute MRI to exclude CVA.
ENT was consulted who felt the CT was suggestive of an acute vs chronic sinusitis but noted that this was unlikely to cause her neurologic symptoms.
Her telemetry showed a NSR with intermittant runs of a rate related LBBB that had been seen previously in [**7-23**].
On the floor, her exam was significant for a ?
of R sided neglect and marked R sided UE/LE weakness.
She received her MRI soon after reaching the floor which showed multiple acute infarctions present within the left frontal lobe and another within the right amygdala that were thought to be c/w either embolic or watershed strokes.
Past Medical History: AIDS (CD4 113 [**2-25**], VL 109) Hep B pancreatitis candidiasis HSV pyelonephritis gonorrhea syphilis and cocaine abuse   Social History: Significant drug use (most recently crack cocaine) but clean for >4mo per her program.
TEE showed no vegetations, no asd/vsd and a bubble study was negative.
ID was consulted regarding sinusitis and recommended broadening her coverage for sinusitis from antibiotics to include antifungals and they recommended tissue biopsy/debridement.
This showed "Similar to the previous examination, there is a soft tissue mass that destroys the sphenoid sinus.
Following the administration of intravenous gadolinium, there is diffuse enhancement of this invasive mass.
Multiple areas of abnormal signal intensity within the cerebral hemispheres are consistent with subacute infarction.
An area of hyperintensity within the left frontal lobe is much more pronounced on today's examination compared to the exam from [**2116-3-11**].
The areas of infarction within the left frontoparietal lobe superiorly also appear more extensive compared to the previous examination.
The abnormal hyperintense signal within the right temporal lobe is unchanged.
On [**3-15**], head CT was performed for decreased responsivenss.
It showed "Very large right MCA and ACA infarct continues to evolve with enlarging mass effect and shift of the median midline structures, subfalcine herniation now 10 mm across the midline, previously 5 with associated effacement of the lateral ventricle.
The suprasellar cistern is also effaced with deviate asymmetry of the quadrigemminal plate cistern secondary to transtentorial herniation that has also worsened in the interval.
There is also effacement of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation along the left MCA and ACA territory secondary to infarct though to a much lesser involvement.
New hypodensity in the right cerebral peduncle is also suspicious for ischemia" and the patient was started on mannitol.
it showed worsening herniation and neurosurgery was again consulted.
