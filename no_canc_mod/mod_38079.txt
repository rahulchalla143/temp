The history is limited secondary to patient's mental retardation, however as per group home, patient was in his USOH until the a.m. of admission when he was noted to have several episodes of emesis with bright red blood.
It is unclear, however, whether the patient had hemoptysis and then emesis, or just hematemesis.

Denies change in bowel or bladder habbits.
He does describe mild URI symptoms over the week prior to admission.
During the month prior to admission he had been hospitalized twice at [**Hospital6 **] for pneumonia, suspected aspiration but not conclusively documented.
A CXR on admission appeared to suggest a L hilar mass, but it was a poor film.
HEENT: anicteric sclerae, no epistaxis, no lesions within nares, oropharynx clear, without blood in posterior oropharynx.
Neck: No cervical LAD, supple, no thyromegaly Lungs: Scattered expiratory wheezes, otherwise CTA b/l, mildly decreased breath sounds throughout.
Right bundle-branch block.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave abnormalities.
Right axis deviation - consider left posterior fascicular block or possible biventricular hypertrophy.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Question of mass in the left hilum.
Large hiatal hernia.
CXR [**9-2**]: Evidence of fairly marked background emphysema.
No evidence of cardiac failure.
No focal pulmonary lesion, i.e., no evidence of a carcinoma.
CT thorax [**9-3**]: Multiple moderately enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, several prominent R hilar lymph nodes.
Subcarinal lymph node.
Images limited secondary to motion artifact.
Partially calcified irregular density in R apex with architectural distortion.

Active TB vs. malignancy.
Recommend 3 month interval chest CT.  Large hiatal hernia with dilatation of esophagous and thickening of lower esophageal wall.
EGD: Findings: Esophagus:  Lumen: A medium size hiatal hernia was seen, displacing the Z-line to 35cm from the incisors, with hiatal narrowing at 32cm from the incisors.
There was no stigmata of recent bleeding.
Follow-up cytology results and treat for candidiasis with fluconazole if positive.
Follow-up biopsy results If positive for H pylori, treat with triple regimen  Additional notes: Mr. [**Known lastname 17204**] should have repeat upper endoscopy in [**1-1**] months to document healing of esophageal ulcer and repeat biopsy to rule out Barrett's esophagus.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 17204**] is a 74 year old male with history of renal cell ca., possible prostate ca with enlarged prostate, elevated PSA, history of hiatal hernia repair, who presents with hemoptysis as well as hematemesis, and a question of a hilar mass.
1) Hematemesis:  Pt underwent EGD which revealed ulcerations and erosions in the esophagus and stomach which were subsequently biopsied (results pending at this time of dictation).
EKG on admission with ST depressions, but cardiac enzymes were negative.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] resumed his other anti-hypertensive medications without incident.
3) Latent tuberculosis: Chest CT performed on [**2104-9-3**] revealed an irregular, partially calcified granuloma as well as 5mm granulomas.
