HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56 year old Caucasian female with a history of hypothyroidism, atrial fibrillation and a large hepatic cyst, who underwent attempted laparoscopic cystectomy and marsupialization of the cyst at an outside institution.
This was complicated by conversion to an open procedure secondary to difficult dissection, but the open procedure was complicated by a large hemorrhage presumably from the hilar area of the liver.
A bile leak was identified.
Despite this she continued to have ongoing jaundice and biliary leak and she was transferred to this facility for further management.
At that time she had marked ascites and jaundice.
She underwent a CAT scan of the abdomen which demonstrated a large cystic appearing lesion within the medial segment of the left lobe and the anterior segment of the right lobe of the liver as well as a large amount of ascites.
These were unable to cross the stenosis located in the hilum.
The following 48 hours later she was taken back to the interventional suite where the catheters were advanced across the stenosis in the right main and left main hepatic duct and the catheters transversed the stenosis and entered the duodenum.
At this time she was unable to aspirate the fluid in the peritoneal cavity and due to continued fever and elevated white count, she was taken to the operating room on the 10th where 5 liters of free flowing bile was found in the peritoneal cavity.
There was also a large abscess located in the right subphrenic space.
Cultures of the abscess and the bile grew out Enterococcus that was sensitive to vancomycin.
She had multiple episodes of diarrhea which had been treated for C.diff colitis at the outside institution and the cultures did not grow Clostridium difficile at this institution.
During the remainder of her hospital course she had several episodes of fever and elevated white count that prompted further imaging studies and no residual abscess within the peritoneal cavity could be documented.
The [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains located inferior to the lateral segment of the left lobe of the liver and in Morison pouch were removed, leaving only the abscess drain in the subphrenic space.
These were balloon dilated with minimal residual stenosis.
Due to continued fever and chills, she was taken back to the interventional suite where an 8 French pigtail catheter was placed into the remnant cyst cavity.
This presumably had become the source of the bile leak as well as abscess.
The catheter drained approximately 40 to 50 cc of bile stained fluid on a daily basis, the cultures of which also grew Enterococcus and gram negative rods.
The transhepatic catheters were internalized and her bilirubin remained slightly elevated, but did not bump any higher.
