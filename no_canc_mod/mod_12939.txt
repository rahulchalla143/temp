Admission Date:  [**2115-11-4**]       Discharge Date: [**2115-11-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2086-6-26**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MICU-ORANG  CHIEF COMPLAINT:   The patient was transferred from outside hospital for continued fevers, jaundice, pancytopenia and splenomegaly.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 29 year old male with a recent prolonged admission at [**Hospital3 35813**] Center in [**Doctor Last Name 792**]with pancytopenia, fevers, liver failure, who was discharged to home for approximately one day and returned with persistent fevers, hypotension and poor urine output.
At the outside hospital, the patient had extensive Infectious Disease work-up because of persistent high fever, including blood cultures which remained negative including fungal cultures, a liver biopsy that showed a granulomatous hepatitis, bone marrow biopsy that showed increasing eosinophils, flow cytometry on the bone marrow biopsy showed no acute leukemia or lymphoma.
A CT scan of the abdomen showed splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, prominent mediastinal lymph nodes and a gallium scan that was negative.
An ACE showed to be elevated at 115.
The patient had no monoclonal gammopathy, and the EEG that the patient had was negative.
Pancytopenia was thought to be due secondary to splenomegaly.
The patient was started on Prednisone 20 mg three times a day for a question of sarcoid and defervesced given the granulomatous infiltrate in the liver that was noted.
The patient had a total of ten units of platelets, two units of packed red blood cells and two units of fresh frozen plasma during that admission and the patient was discharged on [**11-1**], but re-presented on [**11-2**] with increasing shortness of breath and fever to 104.0 F.  At the outside hospital, the patient was started on Zosyn, Diflucan, and Vancomycin for empiric treatment and the patient also had significant hypotension and dopamine was started prior to the transfer of the patient to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for further work-up.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 69**] and transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was hypotensive and immediately continued on the dopamine drip and continued to be febrile.
The patient also had a worsening acidosis with an arterial blood gases of 7.30, pCO2 of 29, pO2 of 90, and an elevation of lactate to 3.0, and given the worsening acidosis and patient's tachypneic appearance, the patient was subsequently intubated for compensation of his acidosis.
Granulomatous hepatitis.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Question history of seizure disorder.
The patient had dried blood in the oropharynx and around the nares.
Neck was supple, without rigidity, and with increased jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy.
Lungs with decreased breath sounds at the bases; tachypnea, no stridor.
Cardiovascular with regular rhythm, tachycardia, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Skin with no rashes.
No asterixis, no pronator drift.
METABOLIC ACIDOSIS:  The patient initially presented with an anion gap metabolic acidosis.
Unclear whether this patient was hypoperfusing versus renal failure or liver involvement or tumor lysis.
With improvement of his metabolic acidosis and maximal ventilatory support, abdominal CT scan on hospital day three showed no splenomegaly, no perforations or free air.
PANCYTOPENIA:  Unclear etiology, thought to be likely due to secondary splenomegaly and splenic sequestration versus an infectious or hematology process, question Ehrlichia.
Also, component of DIC with elevation of his coagulations and low fibrinogen.
The patient was transfused with blood products to support a hematocrit greater than 30 and INR less than 1.5, and platelets greater than 50 given his continued bleeding during this hospital stay.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient was maximally vented for supportive acidosis give poor respiratory compensation.
The patient appeared hypoxic secondary to volume overload and possible pneumonia process at the right apex by CT scan.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The Infectious Disease consultation team assistance was requested in the management of this patient and the patient had an elaborate work-up including multiple serologies for CMV, EBV, as well as numerous Zoonotic diseases that are currently pending at this time.
Hematology/Oncology was also consulted in the management of this patient and there was initial consideration of disseminated sarcoid and the patient was initially placed on a maximum dose of steroids on hospital day one and two without significant improvement of his clinical symptoms and it was thus thought that this was less likely to be sarcoid and the corticosteroids were decreased.
At this time, bone marrow biopsy shows that this infiltrate might be consistent with more a lymphoma, and the patient's clinical course explained by question tumor lysis syndrome given his elevation of uric acid.
Empirical treatment of tumor lysis with allopurinol was initiated.
HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA/HEPATITIS:  Liver biopsy with inflammatory cell infiltrate and granulomas, not suggestive of tuberculosis or sarcoid by report but per [**Hospital6 2121**] pathologist, differential diagnosis includes most likely Hodgkin's lymphoma versus leptospirosis versus other Infectious Disease process.
The patient had an abdominal CT scan that was also unrevealing for any primary process.
The patient got high dose steroids times two days without improvement and decreased distress dose only.
HYPOCALCEMIA:  The patient upon initiation of CVVH, had a significant drop in his calcium, and a calcium drip was initiated during this administration for improvement.
The patient, upon initiation of CVVH with citrate exchange on hospital day three, precipitated severe tetany, hypotension, for which a calcium drip was started.
COAGULOPATHY:  The patient had low platelets and abnormal coagulations, attributed to DIC.
ENT was consulted for epistaxis and recommended supportive care only.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient was essentially anuric during this hospital course, likely attributed to acute tubular necrosis, ATN.
The patient was getting hemodialysis with bicarbonate exchange as well as calcium drip.
PERICARDIAL EFFUSION:  The patient had an echocardiogram initially with mild to moderate pericardial effusion noted.
