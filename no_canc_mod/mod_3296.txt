This occurred in the setting of vague abdominal discomfort and possible melanotic stools though the patient was a poor historian.
He underwent EGD revealing a single pyloric ulcer with a spurting vessel.
His pre-syncope and orthostatic symptoms resolved.
Because of the patient's presenting complaints including exertional dyspnea, diaphoresis and pre-syncope, he did have an EKG and 2 sets of cardiac enzymes all of which were negative for signs of ischemia.
His symptoms were due to hypovolemia associated with the acute blood loss anemia and as above the symptoms resolved with transfusion.
On admit he had some acute on chronic renal failure but his Cr returned to its baseline with correction of his hypovolemia.
