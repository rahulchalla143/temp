There are bilateral effusions, as before, and the right-sided effusion is somewhat larger.

(B) LENIS: No DVT RUQ U/S: Prelim "Cholelithiasis, wall edema, and slight tenderness over GB.
Given effusions and sm amt ascites, wall edema could be due to edema state, so indeterminate for cholecystitis.
If concern for cholecystitis, would suggest HIDA.
CT Abd: IMPRESSION: 1) Bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Nonspecific bowel gas pattern without obvious thickening of the bowel.
No evidence of pneumatosis.
Repeat CXR 12:15 am: increase in size of (B) pleural effusions and new development of CHF   Brief Hospital Course:    1) Hypotension: Sepsis was not likely initially, however patient was spiking fevers with white count.
Patient heart failure seemed to continue to worsen.
2) Abd pain:  Meserentic ischemia less likely as no evidence of pneumatosis on CT abd; no abnormal bowel loops seen.
Changes on RUQ U/S likely related to volume overload 2) Respiratory: patient was vented 3) [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**]: Ct angio revealed 1.6 cm [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1916**] clot, was on on heparin drip, dc'ed secondary to hempotysis 4) afib: continue on amiodarone 6) DM: blood sugar under good control  Patient clinical status continued to decline, the patients family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and her code status was changed.
