She presents from rehab facility with a few hours of low tidal volume.
Over the past several months she has undergone prolonged course with several hospitalizations including a recent admission from [**Date range (1) 49798**] for shortness of breath thought initially to be pneumonia but eventually attributed to COPD exacerbation as opposed to infection.
Due to respiratory failure she underwent a tracheostomy on [**12-25**].
She otherwise has denied any fever, chills, headache, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting.

No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Some  bibasilar atelectasis is also unchanged.
Prominent pulmonary artery is again noted in this individual with history of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
No obvious fracture.
If there has been significant trauma and wrist pain  persists, then followup radiographs in [**7-8**] days could help to assess for  resorption about an occult fracture.
This could represent a post-traumatic finding, though it is of indeterminate acuity.
Possible soft tissue swelling, best assessed by physical exam.
First CMC and triscaphe joint degenerative changes.
The patient was taken to the operating room and, under direct laryngoscopy, was found to have a dislodged tracheostomy.
The tracheostomy was replaced with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 295**] tracheostomy piece without complication.
Her anemia was attributed to anemia of chronic disease given she had no evidence of active bleeding.
Her transfusion was given in conjunction with IV Lasix to avoid exacerbation of her congestive heart failure/pulmonary edema.
No fracture was identified.
On hospital day #3 the patient went to IR for post-pyloric advancement of a Dobhoff tube.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Abdominal pain: your pain is similar to the chronic pain you experienced prior to admission.
Obstructive sleep apnea: while you are on the vent you will receive respiratory support while you are both awake and asleep.
This is very important as sleep apnea contributes to worsening of your pulmonary function and heart failure.
