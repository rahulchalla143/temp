Admission Date:  [**2147-3-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2147-3-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-10-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Shellfish  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**] Chief Complaint: Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization for NSTEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization Intubation Thoracentesis Transfusion of packed RBC Central line placement Upper endoscopy  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 66 yo man with PMH of tobacco use, ?hyperlipidemia, does not see doctor regularly, initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] with respiratory symptoms today AM, treated for COPD, then found to have new LBBB and + troponin and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
Per notes and d/w family, patient was in his USOH until 3 weeks prior to presentation at [**Hospital1 **], when he began to experience upper respiratory symptoms described as cough, productive of yellow-colored sputum, no blood, denied fevers, SOB initially.
Then night PTA, pt c/o some associated SOB with his cough.
Of note, per patient's wife, she states that the patient had been experiencing L shoulder pain with exertion, such as raking the leaves, and that it would resolve with rest after about 10 minutes.
CXR demonstrated bilateral increased interstitial markings c/w CHF vs diffuse infiltrate.
He was treated for COPD exacerbation with combivent neb x 1, solumedrol 125mg IV x 1, albuterol neb x 1.
Later, patient was noted to have trop I elevation to 0.53 and ?new LBBB on EKG and therefore was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
During transfer, patient developed worsening respiratory distress and on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED was intubated for presumed flash pulmonary edema prior to transfer to cath lab for urgent PCI.
In cath lab, pt was found to have 50% mid and proximal LAD disease, subtotal occlusion of L Cx from origin to mid vessel w/ severe disease extending into LPDA and OM2, slow flow in LPDA, 80% ostial/proximal OM1 lesion, 80% proximal RCA lesion (RCA noted to be small, non-dominant).
Cardiac cath course was c/b persistent hypotension and pt was started on dopamine gtt and dobutamine gtt, and had IABP placed for presumed cardiogenic [**Hospital1 **].
Intra-cath ECHO prelim demonstrates good LV fxn (EF>55%), no WMA (although could not exclude inferlateral hypokinesis).
Family History: Father w/ MI in his 70's, Mother with pacemaker, sister w/ CAD in 60's, + "lots of people" with DM, CHF.
Physical Exam: Vitals - T 96.3, HR 134->82, BP 101/49, AC/FiO20.8/TV600/RR28/PEEP5, O2 sat 100%, ABG=7.34/39/135/22 (on 100% FiO2, prior to wean) General - intubated, sedated HEENT - small pupils, equal, reactive to light b/l, dried blood in nares, ENT packing in place Neck - JVD @ 7cm CVS - RRR, balloon pump ascultated, could not assess for M/R/G Lungs - coarse w/ scattered rhonci on right, clear anteriorly on left Abd - soft, no noted HSM, + BS Groin -  Some oozing noted around sheath/PA catheter site in R groin, no noted hematoma on R or L Ext - No LE edema b/l, [**1-2**]+ DP pulses b/l   Pertinent Results: Labs on admit:  [**2147-3-16**] 08:58PM   TYPE-ART TEMP-36.5 PO2-109* PCO2-34 PH-7.35* TOTAL CO2-20* BASE XS--5 [**2147-3-16**] 08:58PM   LACTATE-5.5* [**2147-3-16**] 08:30PM   GLUCOSE-411* UREA N-16 CREAT-1.1 SODIUM-133 POTASSIUM-4.3 CHLORIDE-102 TOTAL CO2-18* ANION GAP-17 [**2147-3-16**] 08:30PM   CK(CPK)-624* [**2147-3-16**] 08:30PM   CK-MB-38* MB INDX-6.1* [**2147-3-16**] 08:30PM   CALCIUM-8.0* PHOSPHATE-2.7 MAGNESIUM-1.6 [**2147-3-16**] 08:30PM   WBC-13.6* RBC-4.55* HGB-13.8* HCT-40.1 MCV-88 MCH-30.3 MCHC-34.4 RDW-13.8 [**2147-3-16**] 08:30PM   NEUTS-92.5* BANDS-0 LYMPHS-6.5* MONOS-1.0* EOS-0.1 BASOS-0  Brief Hospital Course: Assessment/Plan:  Patient is a 65 yo man with PMH hypercholesteromia, presented to [**Hospital1 **] with c/o URI and SOB, found to have [**Hospital 39700**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], en route developed respiratory distress requiring intubation, now in [**Hospital1 **].
Initially, as above, though [**2-2**] COPD, then thought [**2-2**] CHF, but due to clinical picture above, now think likely [**2-2**] infection, as pt appeared w/ septic picture (as above).
HTN and tachycardia treated with nitro gtt and lopressor PRN.
Had increased labored breathing on [**3-22**] therefore re-intubated.
Patient re-extubated [**3-25**] without complication.
He was continued on a long steroid taper for his presumed COPD flare with atrovent MDI's prn.
# Anemia: Patient w/ elevated Hct on initial presentation to 54.5, thought hemoconcentrated from dehydration.
Since that time, trended downward, initially thought secondary to IVF rehydration.
Had epistaxis, ENT repacked nasal cavity on [**3-20**], no recurrence since then.
anginal sxs w/ exertional L shoulder pain - did not seek medical attention.
Then, after presentation to [**Hospital1 **] for URI/SOB, patient r/i for NSTEMI with + Trop 0.53 at OSH, on presentation here, CK=188, MB=28, Index=14.9, Trop=0.3.
Intra cath, pt found to have diffuse disease with LAD lesion (50%), L cx/LPDA/OM2 lesions, OM1 lesion, RCA lesion, s/p 3 x stent to L Cx/LPDA/OM2.
Pump:  Patient w/ respiratory distress that brought him to [**Hospital1 **].
CXR c/w edema vs diffuse infiltrate.
Appeared intravascularly dry in setting of possible sepsis with hypotension, but now BP stabilizing.
Pleural effusion also c/w transudate/CHF.
He became tachycardic with ventilator weaning and developed sinus tachycardia.
# Sepsis/ID/Hemodynamics:  Patient became hypotensive during cardiac catheterization, initially thought [**2-2**] cardiogenic [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] dobutamine, dopamine started, IABP placed.
Given hx of URI sxs and CXR findings (may be diffuse infiltrate vs CHF), may be infectious etiology.
Septic physiology improved, but he continued to have low grade fevers.
Given findings, pneumonia was likely source of infection causing systemic inflammatory state and septic [**First Name3 (LF) **].
# DM2:  Patient hyperglycemic on initial presentation, borderline elevated AG, acidemia (although likely [**2-2**] hypotension, not DKA).
No hx of DM, but pt does not see physicians as outpt, and + DM in his FH.
# Acidemia:  Patient w/ some ABGs on presentation with acidemia (Ph at one point = 7.16) - now resolving w/ pH=7.35.
Lactate elevated at 5.5, therefore likely [**2-2**] lactic acidosis from hypotension/sepsis, although can still consider DKA, although less likely.
Resolved w/ treatment of sepsis above w/ IVF hydration.
Gap acidosis was likely lactic acidosis in setting of sepsis.
