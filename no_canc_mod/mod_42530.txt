History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 1191**] is a 49 year old woman with HIV infection (CD4 450 on [**5-30**]), chronic hepatitis C, lumbar stenosis, presented to PCP with worsening altered mental status over the past week.
Her family sent a note with her relaying the increasing confusion over the past week, with poor med compliance and somnilence.
She had been spending most of the day in bed, had new urinary and fecal incontinence and was unable to walk or stand on her own.
She had pain in the feet and legs if anything contact[**Name (NI) **] her skin, even the slipper she was wearing.
She had a negative NH3 level and head CT.  A RUQ ultrasound showed a distended gall bladder without stones.
A shock ultrasound showed a collapsable IVC and mild right lung base effusion.
On the floor,  she is in severe lower extremitiy pain.
- Hepatitis C (Genotype 3A) dx in [**10/2136**], worsened with alcohol (one bottle of wine per night ++).
She had progressive deterioration in her liver function with her last albumin 2.8, INR 1.5, spleno-megally and thrombocytopenia - Spinal stenosis, and chronic pain in the feet and legs from this and HIV-related peripheral neuropathy; treated with fentanyl patch.
She had an MRI scan in [**11/2136**] that documented multilevel lumbar disc degeneration and spinal stenosis.
- meningitis at age 2 - lower spine cyst, s/p surgery at age 4 - s/p appy at age 6 - Hypertension, recently improved with cirrhosis - G1P1 (vaginal delivery) - mild cervical dysplasia.
- Depression   Social History: She has smoked 1 pack per day for almost 30 years.

H/H on admit 11.1/32.7 and dropped down to 10.0/32.1 by discharge likely due to fluid resuscitation.
Markedly distended gallbladder and dilated CBD.
Evaluation of son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign could not be performed due to altered mental status (hepatic encephalopathy).
A HIDA scan or MRCP is recommended to further evaluate.
Cirrhosis with small amount of perihepatic ascites.
[**2142-6-20**] AP CXR: No acute intrathoracic process.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
MR is more sensitive in detection of acute stroke and small masses.
Right maxillary, ethmoidal and sphenoidal sinus mucosal disease [**2142-6-21**] EKG: Sinus bradycardia.
Low voltage in the precordial leads.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Demonstrate no mass effect or hydrocephalus.
[**2142-6-22**] MRI spine w/o: Degenerative changes from L1-2 to L5-S1 level with spinal stenosis as described above.
No intraspinal fluid collection seen.
Mild spinal stenosis is seen at L2-3 and moderate spinal stenosis at L3-4 and L4-5.
Foraminal changes as described above, predominantly on the right side at L3-4 and L4-5 levels.
Bilateral moderate foraminal narrowing is seen at L5-S1 level.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: This is a 49 year old woman with HIV, HCV, lumbar stenosis presenting with hypotension, altered mental status, leg pain.
# HYPOTENSION: Collapsable IVC and no evidence of fluid overload suggestive of hypovolemic or septic shock.
The patient had a history of poor fluid intake.
However, we did not feel that her hypotension was due to sepsis and we discontinued her antibiotics prior to floor transfer.
On the floor, the pt did not have any episodes of hypotension and remained hemodynamically stable until discharge.
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: This was most likely related to encephalopthy [**1-1**] liver failure.
When her mental status improved, the pt stated that she had been non-compliant with her lactulose at home.
# BACK and LEG PAIN: Patient with longstanding spinal stensois with neropathy.
# HCV and ALCOHOLIC CIRRHOSIS: Was started on Lactulose, Rifamixan, B12, folate, and thiamine.
No known bleeding but likely has varices.
Patient' haptoglobin was down and LDH elevated suggesting hemolysis.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Cr 2.3 from baseline 1.1.
Casts in urine c/w pre-renal, either from hypotension or hepatorenal.
# FLUID OVERLOAD: The pt was felt to be fluid overloaded and so Lasix 20mg IV and Spironolactone 100mg PO qday were started with appropriate UOP response.
Presumed hepatic encephalopathy due to home noncompliance with Lactulose  Secondary Diagnoses: - HIV, diagnosed in [**2121**], on atazanavir boosted with ritonavir, lamivudine, and raltegravir (but not taking).
- Hepatitis C (Genotype 3A) dx in [**10/2136**], worsened with alcohol (one bottle of wine per night ++).
She had progressive deterioration in her liver function with her last albumin 2.8, INR 1.5, spleno-megally and thrombocytopenia - Spinal stenosis, and chronic pain in the feet and legs from this and HIV-related peripheral neuropathy; treated with fentanyl patch.
She had an MRI scan in [**11/2136**] that documented multilevel lumbar disc degeneration and spinal stenosis.
- meningitis at age 2 - lower spine cyst, s/p surgery at age 4 - s/p appy at age 6 - Hypertension, recently improved with cirrhosis - G1P1 (vaginal delivery) - mild cervical dysplasia.
- Depression   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for altered mental status and hypotension presumably because you had not been taking your home Lactulose, and were having leg pain.
You also received an MRI of your spine which did not show any cause for your mental status or your leg pain.
Please return to the hospital for: fevers, chills or night sweats, pain uncontrolled with over the counter medicines, uncontrollable nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, confusion or altered mental status.
