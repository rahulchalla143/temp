Admission Date:  [**2189-8-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2189-8-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2109-3-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ativan / OxyContin  Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 10493**] Chief Complaint: Bilateral foot pain and hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 2491**] is an 80 year old man with DJD, ?
gout, kidney disease, nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (?amio toxicity), dilated cardiomyopathy with EF of 20-25% s/p ICD placement presenting with bilateral foot pain and falls for 3 weeks.
The patient believes his symptoms began suddenly, and progressed over a 2 week time.
He noted increasing pain, swelling in his ankle and 1st MTP joints bilaterally.
He also noticed slightly worsening dyspnea on exertion and generalized weakness.
He denied SOB but looked dyspneic and upon further questioning admitted to dyspnea.
He was noted to have increased pain and swelling of his ankles and MCP joints bilaterally and was given cefazolin 1gm IV ONCE for suspected septic arthritis.
On the floor, he remained asymptomatic but continued to be transiently hypotensive occasionally to the 80s, and at one point down to the 60s, and fortunately responded to a 250cc bolus of NS.
Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.
Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
Denies rashes or skin changes.
Compared to his last testing two and a half weeks ago there is a marked decline in both his forced vital capacity (about 400 mL) and a drop in his FEV1 by about 400 mL as well  2) Idiopathic DCM, chronic LBBB, sp ICD implantation for primary   3) Hypothyroidism  4) Bilateral TKR  5) T12 compression fracture in [**2188-3-3**]  6) Right peroneal nerve injury [**2189**],now improving  7) CKD .

[**8-11**] CXR: Increased interstitial markings bilaterally, most noted in the periphery and at the lung bases, mildly increased since the prior study.
Findings consistent with interstitial lung disease, which may have progressed.

Brief Hospital Course: 80 year old man with DJD, ?
gout, kidney disease, chronic pneumonitis (?amio toxicity), dilated cardiomyopathy with EF of 20-25% and ICD placement for primary prevention and chronic pneumonitis presenting with bilateral foot pain and falls for 3 weeks with hypotension, [**Last Name (un) **], leukocytosis, worsening intestitial infiltrates.
Cardiogenic shock due to CHF exacerbation/MI was also considered but EKG and physical exam ___and echo?___ made this less likely.
CXR showing increased interstitial infiltrate density in setting of steroid-induced immunosuppression made atypical PNA a concern, and numerous studies for legionalla,PCP,[**Name10 (NameIs) 3019**],beta galactoman,glucan were all negative.
Given increasing density of interstitial infiltrates on CXR and dyspnea, would be concerned about a an atypical pulmonary infection, although patient arrived with normal rest saturations.
Ultimately, because pt presented with hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and recent steroid dose reduction, and because sx resolved rapidly after IV dexamethasone, it was concluded that adrenal crisis was most likely etiology of hypotension.
On Day #2 he was transferred from MICU to floors where he received prednisone PO and remained afebrile with stable VS. Cortisol stim test and random cortisol both were elevated but this is because pt was being treated with steroids during test.
#) Arthritis: Given podagra in left MTP in setting of elevated serum uric acid, acout gout was diagnosed.
There was also concern for septic arthritis given fever, white count etc so pt was initially started on broad spectrum abx but synovial fluid cx were negative.
#) Dilated cardiomyopathy: Echo on hosp day #3 (done to R/O CHF as etiology of hypotension) showed no progression of CHF (severe systolic, EF 20-25%).
#) Hypothyroidism: TSH normal when checked to R/O hypothyroid as etiology of hypotension.
Adrenal insufficiency from stopping steroids 2.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital yesterday with low blood pressure and swollen feet.
There is a small chance that you have a joint infection; cultures of your joint fluid have been negative so far but you should follow up with your PCP about these results and/or if your symptoms worsen.
