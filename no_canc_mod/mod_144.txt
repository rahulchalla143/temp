Multilevel degenerative changes within the lumbar spine, most prominent at C4-C5 with disc bulge and facet degenerative changes causing minimal narrowing of the spinal cord and indentation of the thecal sac.
Posterior soft tissue swelling with no obvious disruption of the ligamentum flavum, anterior, posterior spinous ligaments within the cervical region.Increased signal in interspinous region without widening of interspinous distance indicates trauma without disruption.
