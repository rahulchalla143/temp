Status post removal of the rectal tube, no evidence of volvulus recurrence.
Interval increase in extent of the right lower lung opacities, a followup with a dedicated chest radiograph is recommended.
KUB [**2132-8-14**] 7:22 AM  IMPRESSION: Interval recurrence of sigmoid colon dilatation, an asymmetric appearance and absence of dilation of proximal large bowel, may represent pseudovolvulus.
No volvulus identified.
No obstruction identified.
No grossly dilated small bowel is identified.
Again noted is one abnormal colonic loop with a thumbprinting pattern.
KUB [**2132-8-17**] 8:20 AM  IMPRESSION: No volvulus identified.
Although there is a capacious sigmoid colon, there is no evidence of sigmoid volvulus.
Contrast passed through to the cecum without evidence of obstruction.
Scout image demonstrates diffuse atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta and iliac system.
No evidence of obstruction or volvulus.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure(PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
