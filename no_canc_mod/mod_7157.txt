Admission Date:                   Discharge Date:  [**2139-2-15**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  M   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44-year-old male with end stage renal insufficiency and diabetes who was on hemodialysis for four years and last dialysis was two days prior to admission.
The patient denied nausea, vomiting and  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes, neuropathy and retinopathy.
Hemodialysis for several years.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes toe amputation, CABG times four in [**2135**] and left AVF and left lower extremity bypass surgery.
On postoperative day #1 the patient was placed in the ICU as per routine and on the following several days patient appeared to have a delayed kidney graft function and patient was continued on hemodialysis.
The patient was recovering in the ICU while regaining his renal function and, patient's recovery was complicated by an acute inferior posterior MI on postoperative day #7 and patient underwent emergent catheterization which showed that his CAB graft were open and he had non-bypassable disease.
Cardiac echo showed inferior posterior severe hypokinesis with ejection fraction of 35-40%, no significant pericardial effusion and at the time patient was recommended to undergo ICU management of MI and hypotension and careful volume management in view of elevated filling pressure.
So patient was taken back to the surgical Intensive Care Unit undergoing management for his acute MI.
On postoperative day #10 the patient, while undergoing dialysis, appeared to have a bradycardia and ventricular tachy and hypotension and patient was placed on Dobutamine.
At the time patient's heart rate was in the 30's and systolic blood pressure was at 60's and Dobutamine was started and patient appeared to be critically ill at the time and on [**2-14**] the patient underwent another cardiac catheterization which showed unchanged patency since previous study and temporary pacemaker was placed in the right ventricular apex and due to his worsening hypotension and deteriorating condition, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed on [**2139-2-15**] and on return from cath lab status post intra-aortic balloon placement, patient was noted to have heart rate of 40 and no readable blood pressure, no pulse, ACLS protocol was initiated and return of BP and heart rate capture was pacer.
Once again return of BP and pulse and all drips maximized and patient's condition was discussed with the family and decision was made to proceed with comfort measures only and at that time patient was started on a Morphine drip and family does not wish to perform chemical codes if further defibrillation occurs and patient died at 6:15 on [**2139-2-15**].
Addendum: The patient had severe small vessel coranary disease which led to intractable MI.
