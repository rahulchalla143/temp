The patient was referred in the [**Hospital1 18**] after developing new onset shortness of breath at her [**Hospital1 1501**].
Her CXR was notable for persistent opacities in the RLL with worsening pulmonary edema.

There is cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion, interstitial edema and bilateral pleural effusions, representing CHF, worse since [**4-23**].
There is persistent focal airspace opacity involving the right lung base, also more confluent over the series of studies, likely representing pneumonic consolidation; no new airspace process is seen elsewhere.
Atherosclerotic changes involving the thoracic aorta are redemonstrated.
Persistent confluent airspace process involving the right lung base, likely representing pneumonic consolidation.
CHF with interstitial edema and bilateral pleural effusions, worse since [**4-23**].
>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..  Brief Hospital Course: 86 year old woman with hx of CAD s/p CABG, biventricular CHF, COPD, DM2 who presented with acute hypoxia and hypotension.
Hypoxia secondary to Aspiration Pneumonia: Likely multifactorial with residual pneumonia +/- additional aspiration with co-incident pulmonary edema (potentially capillary leak from UTI).
Patient presented on day 8 of 10 of health-care associated pneumonia therapy.
Her oxygen requirement improved throughout her stay.
Speech/swallow evaluation consisitent with moderate dysphagia.
Hypotension: ICU team thought likely related to infection in patient with poor cardiac reserve (biV dysfunction).
She was weaned off pressors and did not require any further pressors or fluid boluses.
Psychiatry evaluated the patient and was concerned for delirium versus catatonia.
The patient was deemed not to have capacity at that tiem and per the strong wishes of her HCP, the patient's code status was changed to DNR/DNI on [**2149-5-4**].
Anemia: Normocytic anemia with elevated RDW but with no evidence of acute blood loss or hemolysis.
Biventricular ischemic CHF: currently intra-vascularly wet given edema in legs and pulmonary edema in setting of likely infection.
no evidence of an ischemic event and CE unremarkable.
Diabetes mellitus type 2: currently well controlled.
Hospice/Comfort measures -- Palliative care was consulted given patient's poor functional status and numerous recent admissions.
They decided, consistent with Ms. [**Known lastname 16013**] previous conversations, that she would not want aggressive care and recurrent hospitalizations.
She continues to recieve oral and IV morphine for pain (neck/hips).
Cardiac medications were continued to avoid symptomatic palpatations.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Morphine 10 mg/mL Solution Sig: 0.5-1 mg Intravenous every four (4) hours as needed for pain: breakthrough or if unable to take po.
Ativan 2 mg/mL Solution Sig: 0.5-1 mg Injection every four (4) hours as needed for agitation/anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Meadowbrook - [**Location (un) 2624**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Hypoxia Aspiration Pneumonia Pulmonary Edema Delirium   Discharge Condition: Vital Signs Stable, bed bound, intermittently somnolent, cachectic, PICC in place.
