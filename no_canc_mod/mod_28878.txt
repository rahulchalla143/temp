History of Present Illness: 53 year old male who developed atrial flutter in [**2127**].
He underwent an atrial fibrillation ablation in [**3-/2131**]; however, had recurrence shortly thereafter.
He had been doing well until [**5-22**] when he presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with two hours of left lower extremity pain and pallor and was diagnosed with left leg arterial clot.
He also had left lower extremity four compartment fasciotomies and evacuation and drainage of a left medial calf hematoma.
Of note, the patient has a history of brain aneurysm in [**2117**] and [**2127**] and had a subdural hematoma in [**2131**].
The patient is very reluctant to be on anticoagulation long term given his past medical history but was on it short term after recent left leg arterial clot.
He currently reports episodes of palpitations occurring two to three times per week.
He has no associated chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dizziness, syncope or presyncope.
He recently had cardiac monitoring which showed primarily sinus rhythm and sinus bradycardia with rates ranging  form 49 to 68bpm.
There were several short episodes of Atrial Fibrillation with the longest 1 minute in duration.
Given his palpitations, concern with anticoagulation and recent cardiac study with documented atrial fibrillation, he has been referred for consideration of MAZE and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1916**] removal.

There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post-CPB: The patient is AV-Paced, on no inotropes.
The patient was extubated on post operative day 1 with hypoxia after extubation requiring noninvasive ventilation.
He was hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support on POD 1.
Sputum eventually grew out staph coag positive and cirpto was d/c'd and he was started on IV Vanco.
He developed post-operative afib and was started on betablockers for but developed a junctional rhythm.
He was anticoagulated with coumadin for afib and was sensitive to coumadin dosing.
The wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
