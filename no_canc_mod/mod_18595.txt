By report, the chest pain has been intermittent for at least a month, but she did not tell her family about it until this week.
She presented to [**Hospital6 3105**] On [**5-15**] for increased severity of this pain.
She describes the pain as a "sharp" pain starting in left shoulder blade and radiating around to left anterior chest associated with some shortness of breath.
Pain is worse with exertion and improves w/ rest.
By report, she also has been having left shoulder pain and started on percocet at [**Hospital6 5016**].
At [**Hospital3 **], she had nausea with emesis x 3 (non-bloody).
First set two sets of cardiac enzymes were negative; on eve of [**5-16**], however, by report new TW in precordial leads and + TnT --> started on heparin gtt and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**].
Currently denying active chest pain or shortness of breath, though endorses mild nausea.
ROS: On review of symptoms, denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: CAD cath in [**2119**] at OSH with 70% LAD stenosis, 60% LCX stenosis  Cath in [**1-2**] with stent to RCA ETT in [**2123**] at OSH with no ischemia and 60% LVEF DM2 with retinopathy adn nephropathy HTN Hypercholesterolemia obesity OA depression SEVERE NONCOMPLIANCE GERD with hiatal hernia anxiety tension HA CRI 1.0-1.3 baseline Cr PAD h/o cholecystectomy   Social History: Has lived in U.S. since [**2098**] from [**Male First Name (un) 1056**].
Family History: mother with diabetes and CAD and an aunt with the same.
No murmurs or rubs.
?mild exacerbation of pain on palpation of shoulder Resp: CTAB Abd: obese, soft, NT/ND.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM  [**2126-5-18**] Mild left ventrical apical aneurysm with severe global systolic  dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery  systolic hypertension.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2126-5-19**] 12:35 PM Very mildly echogenic liver consistent with questionable fatty infiltration.
Coronary angiography showed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
The left main coronary artery had moderate calcification but no angiographically apparent flow limiting stenoses.
The LAD was diffusely calcified with a proximal stenosis of 90% followed by another 90% stenosis in mid segment.
The RCA was a large dominant vessel with severe instent restenosis proximally.
Arterial conduit angiography revealed a robust patent LIMA with no lesions.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left sided filling pressures (LVEDP was 32 mm Hg).
Systemic arterial pressures were severely elevated (aortic pressure was 179/83 mm Hg).
There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve upon pullback of the catheter from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta.
Severely elevated left sided filling pressures.
Severely elevated systemic arterial pressure.
Severe resting perfusion defects of the apex, distal inferior wall and the mid and basal inferoseptal walls.
Mild resting perfusion defects of the inferior wall and distal ventricle and normal perfusion of the mid and basal anterior and anterolateral walls, consistent with high probability of recovery of function after revascularization.
Inreased right ventricular uptake, consistent with global reduction in left ventricular perfusion.
She went in to rapid atrial fibrillation, which was treated with metoprolol and amiodarone.
For the next few days, her rhythm varied from bradycardia (junctional and sinus) in the 30's to rapid AFib.
Anticoagulation for AFib was initiated with warfarin, with a target INR 2.0-2.5.
