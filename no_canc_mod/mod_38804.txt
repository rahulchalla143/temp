Admission Date:  [**2103-12-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2103-12-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2053-11-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Erythromycin Base / prednisone  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**] Chief Complaint: L arm and L leg weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: The pt is a 50 year-old R-handed woman with PMHx of hypothyroidism, distant hx of Hodgkins lymphoma s/p chemotherapy and radiation, now s/p pacemaker placement on [**2103-11-30**] for 3rd degree heart block of unknown origin who presents as a code stroke with new L arm and L leg weakness.
She noticed that her L arm and shoulder hurt near where the pacemaker was placed.
The next morning ([**2103-12-1**]) she woke up to go to the bathroom and other than some L arm soreness felt normal.
However, she was then gotten out of bed at 10am to go to a CXR, and she felt her L leg "give out", and she felt it was too weak to support her weight.
So, she was sat down by the nurses, told to rest, and when the transportation team came to get her again at 11am, she was able to get up and walk to the stretcher without difficulty.
She was then discharged home at around 2pm and had no difficulty walking to the car, or walking out of the car into her home.
She was watching the football game at around 4:30pm (although she thinks could have been as early as 3:30pm or as late as 5pm), when she felt lightheaded and sweaty, and then noticed she couldn't hold herself up on the cough, and tried to scoot up.
She didn't notice any difficulty with her L arm, but she was "trying to keep it from moving" because of her recent pacemaker placement on that side.
In the ED a code stroke was called for her L leg weakness, and she was found to have a R ACA stroke as described below.
On neuro ROS, the pt reports L leg weakness as above, denies current headache, loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty.
Denies difficulties producing or comprehending speech.
No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or chills.
No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain.
Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
No relapses since then.

There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may be due to a trace effusion.
No focal consolidation is seen.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is mild prominence of the right hilum which could relate to underlying vasculature, however, recommend further evaluation with dedicated PA and lateral views.
Blunting of left costophrenic angle which may be due to a small pleural effusion.
Mild prominence of the right hilum for which further evaluation with dedicated PA and lateral views is recommended.
There is no definitive pneumothorax seen but minimal apical pleural air cannot be excluded and repeated radiograph is recommended in case patient is symptomatic.
Left lower lobe consolidation has progressed since the prior study and might reflect developing infection, worsening atelectasis or aspiration.
Left and right pleural effusions are small, unchanged since the prior study.
Mild vascular engorgement is seen.
CT/CTA BRAIN WITH PERFUSION / CTA NECK Study Date of [**2103-12-1**] 8:59 PM FINDINGS:  On the unenhanced head CT, there is no evidence for acute ischemia.
There is no hemorrhage, midline shift or mass effect.
Evaluation of the CTA of the neck demonstrates mild atheromatous irregularity of the right common and proximal ICA but without significant stenosis.
There is also a mild plaque at the origin of the right vertebral artery which causes mild stenosis.
There is a plaque at the origin of the left ICA and the left carotid bulb causing mild approximately 20-30% stenosis.
The left vertebral artery is markedly hypoplastic and there appears to be poor flow proximally which could be related to high-grade stenosis or hypoplasia.
The remaining of the left cervical vertebral artery also demonstrates irregularity which could be related to atherosclerotic disease or may be technical in nature.
There is moderate plaquing at the right subclavian artery beyond the takeoff of the vertebral artery.
CTA images through the brain demonstrate no evidence for high-grade stenosis, or vascular occlusion.
No aneurysm is seen within limits of the examination.
There is mild irregularity and narrowing of the ACA branches which may be related to atherosclerotic disease.
There is possibility of an infundibulum at the origin of the left superior cerebellar artery.
Bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
There are apparent goiterous changes in bilateral thyroid lobes which should be correlated with an ultrasound if not already performed.
There is a rounded focus of ground-glass density in the right upper lobe which could represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
There is also apparent consolidation in the left upper lobe.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence for vascular occlusion intracranially.
Atherosclerotic disease in the bilateral carotid bifurcations and proximal ICAs, left greater than right but which does not appear to be more than 50%.
Thyroid lesions which could represent goiter but consider further evaluation with ultrasound if not already performed.

TRACING #3   Read by: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 251**] [**Doctor Last Name 640**]    Intervals Axes Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 78 0 136 442/473 0 -67 117  Brief Hospital Course: 50RHF with PMH of hypothyroidism, distant history of Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p chemotherapy and radiation, and 3rd degree heart block of unknown origin s/p pacemaker placement on [**2103-11-30**], who represented as a code stroke on [**2103-12-1**] with left leg>arm weakness in keeping with right ACA ischemia.
Her exam was initially notable for left proximal arm weakness and complete left leg plegia.
She was admitted to the ICU and started on pressors with significant improvement in her weakness suggesting hypoperfusion as opposed to infarction.
CTA (it was not possible to perform MRI scanning due to the presence of her pacemaker) revealed a stenotic right ACA and no clear acute infarction.
She developed orthopnoea and dyspnea on exertion and CXR revealed bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary edema likely due to her aggressive IV fluid resuscitation to maintain her BP.
She received a single dose of IV furosemide in the ICU and no further diuresis given concern for further hypoperfusion.
# Neurology: Patient was recently s/p pacemaker placement on [**2103-11-30**] and represented as a code stroke on [**2103-12-1**] with left leg>left arm weakness in keeping with right ACA ischemia.
Initial examination revealed left proximal arm weakness and complete L leg plegia and notably this improved somewhat with elevation of her BP.
CT head revealed no evidence for acute ischemia, hemorrhage, midline shift or mass effect.
CTA head showed mild irregularity and narrowing of the ACA branches particularly on the right felt likely due to atherosclerosis in addition to no other evidence for high-grade stenosis or vascular occlusion.
CT perfusion revealed decreased perfusion in the right ACA territory.
CTA neck showed atherosclerotic disease in the bilateral carotid bifurcations and proximal ICAs, left greater than right but which does not appear to be more than 50% in addition to mild plaque at the origin of the right vertebral artery which causes mild stenosis and the left vertebral artery was noted to be markedly hypoplastic with poor flow proximally which was felt could be related to high-grade stenosis or hypoplasia.
In addition, there was incidental note of apparent goiterous changes in bilateral thyroid lobes.
Her weakness continued to improve rapidly, and by [**2103-12-3**] she had regained full strength throughout her left arm and leg.
However she began to complain of shortness of breath when lying flat, and a CXR showed pulmonary edema and moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
On advice of cardiology and out of concern for dropping her BP and causing hypoperfusion symptoms, she received no further diuretics.
She was followed by cardiology and had a pacemaker interrogation on [**2103-12-2**] which showed normal function and although she had episodes of paced tachycardia in the 100s and per cardiology this tachycardia represented pacing from SA node.
Stroke risk factors were addressed.
She was monitored on telemetry and this showed a paced rhythm throughout.
Pre-op TTE on [**2103-11-30**] showed normal systolic function with no evidence of cardioembolic source and this was not repeated.
The diagnosis was felt to be likely ACA hypoperfusion given ACA narrowing on CTA and perfusion deficit on CTP with resolution of symptoms with higher BPs.
Although she was initially symptomatic as a result of her bilateral pleural effusions with orthopnoea and dyspnoea on exertion, this improved and repeat CXRs showed better aeration but still moderate pleural effusions.
She was advised that if she had any further weakness on the left side, she should return to the ED and in the interim should try and lie flat to improve blood pressure.
She began to complain of shortness of breath when lying flat on [**2103-12-3**].
Repeat CXR showed pulmonary edema and bilateral moderate pleural effusions.
Fluids were stopped and she received 10mg IV furosemide in the ICU and no further fluids due to concern for further hypoperfusion.
She had episodes of paced tachycardia in the 100s and per cardiology this tachycardia represented pacing from SA node.
# ID: She remained afebrile with no leukocytosis and no leukocytosis.
She was continued on Augmentin 500mg Q8H for a planned 14 day course for R hand cellulitis resulting from a dog bite.
UA was equivocal and UCx revealed no growth.
# PULM: CXR on [**2103-12-2**] showed pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions.
This had slightly improved on [**2103-12-3**] although still showed b/l pleural effusions.
IVF were stopped and her respiratory status was monitored closely in the ICU.
On transfer to the floor she was initially symptomatic as above with orthopnoea and dyspnoea on exertion, this improved and repeat CXRs showed better aeration but still moderate pleural effusions.
# ENDO: TSH was found to be elevated at 6.9.
Patient has a history of hypothyroidism and note incidental finding on CT of apparent goiterous changes in bilateral thyroid lobes.
IVF were discontinued due to concern for pulmonary edema.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 30485**], You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2103-12-1**] with left arm and leg weakness.
You were found to have decreased blood flow to the right front part of your brain.
Your weakness improved greatly after being started on medications to increase your blood pressure.
For this reason, we believe the most likely cause of your weakness was relatively low blood pressure causing inadequate flow to your brain through this narrowed vessel after starting lisinopril.
If you have any further weakness on this side, you must come back to the ED and in the interim should try and lie flat as this improves blood pressure.
In order to increae your blood pressure, we used a large volume of IV fluids and this resulted in fluid collections in the outside of both lungs.
You developed some bleeding in the urine, likely as a result of the placement of a catheter.
We made the following changes to your medications: We HELD lorazepam as this can lower blood pressure (we prefer that you discontinue this) We STOPPED lisinopril We STARTED aspirin 325mg daily We STARTED atorvastatin 20mg daily Please continue augmentin for your dog bite and possible urinary infection to finish on [**2103-12-14**]  If you experience any of the below listed danger signs, please call your doctor or go to the nearest Emergency Department.
