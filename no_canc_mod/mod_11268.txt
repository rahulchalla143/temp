In the ED, the patient had a witnessed fever for which he was given Ativan, glucose for persistent hypoglycemia with improvement in patient's mental status in approximately two hours.
Unclear [**Name2 (NI) 44024**] events for unresponsiveness other than hypoglycemia.
CT Scan of the head was negative for massive bleeding.
Sodium was found to be 122 and ammonia also 122.
The patient was admitted to the MICU at the outside hospital with hypotension with SVP in the 80s and 90s.
Hyponatremia was treated with IV normal saline and Lasix without improvement in urine output.
The patient was also noted to be coagulopathic and treated with vitamin K 10 mg p.o.
Abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for pelvic portal vein thrombosis which was consistent with liver cirrhosis, no focal masses, no thrombosis, large ascites.
It was determined there was no further need for paracentesis.
The patient was determined to be in oliguric renal failure likely prerenal with a pheno of 0.2 and urine sodium of 18 in the setting of liver disease, but not severe enough to be felt to be hepatorenal syndrome.
Hepatitis C and Hepatitis B, child class C cirrhosis, history of ascites, encephalopathy, cordal gastropathy, esophageal varices grade II.
Patient has recently been removed from the transplant list due to lack of social support.
History of urinary tract infection.
History of coag negative staphylococcus bacteremia secondary to PICC line infection.
History of SVP with e.coli in [**8-1**].
Echo on [**11-1**] showed an ejection fraction of greater than 60%, 1+ MR, 2+ TR, mild pulmonary hypertension.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Pancreatic carcinoma, hypertension and myocardial infarction.
Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation with scleral icterus.
Mucous membranes dry, no lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention.
Cardiac:  S1, S2, regular rate and rhythm There is a II/VI systolic ejection murmur.
Abdomen:  Soft, mildly distended, bowel sounds positive.
Extremities: 3+ pitting edema to above the knee bilaterally.
Blood cultures grew out one of four bottles gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
Right ventricle systolic function normal, 1+ MR, 3+ TR, mild pulmonary hypertension, no effusion.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Liver, she is felt to be in worsening liver failure in the setting of progressive of cirrhosis.
Patient's mental status remained relatively slow, however she had no signs of acute encephalopathy such as asterixis.
It is unclear whether this is the patient's baseline, a mild encephalopathy not correctable with Lactulose or perhaps some sort of permanent neurologic damage which occurred in the setting of hypoglycemia and seizure.
without significant change in her INR which remained between 1.9 and 2.0 throughout hospitalization.
Despite this, she was not found to have a bleeding tendency on repeat paracentesis or on central line removal.
It was found to be negative for indices for SVP and no evidence of significant hemorrhage.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Patient was running low grade fevers in the range of 99 to 100.
Cultures drawn from the line grew one out of four bottles of gram positive cocci in clusters and pairs.
It is unclear whether this is contamination at this time, however central line has been removed and patient is currently afebrile and asymptomatic.
Anemia requiring multiple blood transfusions.
