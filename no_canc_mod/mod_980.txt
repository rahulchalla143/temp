HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old Jamaican female with a history of lymphocytic pleocytosis of unknown etiology, a seizure disorder, a history of herpes encephalitis that was treated empirically (although never diagnosed as herpes encephalitis), hypertension and a suprasellar mass noted on CT scan in [**2125-9-15**].
She presented with a one week history of nausea and vomiting on [**2125-10-6**] as well as a three day history of atypical chest pain.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history, as stated above, included lymphocytic pleocytosis, a seizure disorder, hypertension and a suprasellar mass.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was afebrile and vital signs were stable.
She seemed slightly confused.
The pulmonary examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes, rales or rhonchi.
The cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The abdomen was soft, nontender and nondistended with no rebound or guarding and no hepatosplenomegaly.
The extremities had 2+ pulses times four with no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
CARDIAC STUDIES:  The electrocardiogram on admission showed T wave inversions in I through III, aVF and V2 through V6 with early R wave progression.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2124-8-15**], the widespread T wave inversions were new.
Myocardial ischemia was considered, but ruled out by enzymes.
A stress test thereafter showed no angina with an uninterpretable electrocardiogram.
RADIOLOGY DATA:  An MRI of the head showed the base of the third ventricle a suprasellar mass with associated foci of increased intensity on the flare sequences within both cerebral hemispheres, primarily in the periventricular location, possibly consistent with sarcoidosis and probably not consistent with herpes encephalitis.
She continued to complain of nausea and vomiting on day #2.
The neurosurgery service was consulted for possible biopsy of the mass and the leptomeninges.

On the steroids, the patient's nausea and vomiting were noted to be improving.
However, she remained in the hospital because of continued concern about her diabetes insipidus.
