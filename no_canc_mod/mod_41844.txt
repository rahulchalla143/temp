The patient was ultimately intubated for his COPD flare as he developed hypoxic respiratory failure and admitted to the MICU.
While in the micu, he was treated with prednisone for COPD flare and extubated the day before admission at which time severe lower extremity weakness was noted.
He underwent urgent spine imaging with both CT and MRI, which were concerning for epidural abscess, diskitis, osteomyelitis and collapse of T9 with cord compression with edema from T8-T11.

Also with discitis, osteomyelitis.
Severe cord compression with edema extending from T8-T11  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 y.o.
man with Stage IV COPD CAD s/p CABG, CHF admitted to OSH with COPD flare, his course was complicated by hypercarbic respiratory failure and lower extremity paralysis with cord compression and paraspinal abscess now POD12 s/p surgical debridement and fusion, course complicated by transient episodes of complete AV block, poor systolic function, respiratory failure x 2 requiring intubation, and hypotension requiring pressors.
His respiratory failure has resolved, his hypotension is resolved on midodrine, but he has persistent LE paralysis secondary to paraspinal abscess/cord compression.
Active Issues  #)Respiratory failure: Per OSH, pt had COPD exacerbation leading to hypercarbic respiratory failure and intubation and uneventful extubation.
He did experience dyspnea [**12-26**] excess secretions and atelectasis.
However, he began having respiratory distress and poor blood gases necessitating transfer back to the MICU, where he was intubated and put on pressure support.
He became hypotensive and tachycardic in this setting, likely b/c he was put on pressure support b/c of concern for an ARDS picture.
He did well on CPAP, but extubation was held off due to his inability to clear secretions.
He passed this trial and was able to be weaned down to 4L NC over the next few days w/o having acute respiratory distress.
# Hypotension: This is the result of multifactorial processes: poor systolic function + neurogenic hypotension + sepsis + sedation.
Also has baseline orthostatic hypotension for which he was on fludrocortisone prior to admission.
However, he again became hypotensive in the setting of pressure-support ventilation and an [**Month/Year (2) 7792**].
He also had elevated troponins and was diagnosed w/ an [**Month/Year (2) 7792**] in this repeat setting of hypotension, so the [**Month/Year (2) 7792**] may have contributed to his hypotension by worsening his systolic function, although his LVEF remained at 35% on f/u Echo.
# Epidural abscess and T9 osteomyelitis s/p debridement and fusion: Pt presented with cord compression and lower extremity flaccid paralysis [**12-26**] epidural abscess and osteomyelitis.
Likely source was sacral decubitus ulcer.
ID on board and advised to continue vancomycin for 6 weeks since the tissue grew Strep viridans but after sensitivities returned changed the antibiotic to ceftriaxone.
#[**Hospital 7792**]: In the setting of his hypotension upon his second transfer to the MICU on [**5-31**], he was found to have elevated troponins for which he was started on heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg, and ASA 325 for [**Month/Day (4) 7792**].
A TTE, which was poor quality, was performed [**6-1**] which revealed LVEF 35%, moderate LV dilated systolic dysfunction hypokinesis w/ distal 3rd of ventricle having hypokinesis, nl R chamber, no AR/MR, and no effusions.
He has follow-up with his cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13310**] on [**7-7**], at this appointment anticoagulation for LV aneurysm should be considered but was deferred during hospitalization given comorbidities and recent surgery.
#Complete AV Block / Tachycardia-Bradycardia syndrome: Pt had 2 episodes of bradycardia with complete AV block which required atropine and pressors to break during initial MICU stay.
Per cardiology and EP, a pacemaker is likely to be required after his acute osteomyelitis has resolved and antibiotics course completed.
Given continued concern for possible cardiac vegetations or complication such as abscess, a TEE was performed [**6-13**], which revealed no cardiac vegetations or clinically significant valvular disease.
He developed renal failure where his Cr doubled to 2.2 from [**5-31**] to [**6-4**] following his episode of hypotension and [**Last Name (LF) 7792**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] this was likely pre-renal in nature.
#Delirium: On the 1st MICU admission, he exhibited waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status with some agitation before transfer to the general floor.
He did require haldol 6 mg IV during his second MICU stay due to acute agitation.
# Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: This was an issue which the ACS service was monitoring.
This ulcer has not been improving per nursing, wound care, and ACS.
# Chronic systolic heart failure: EF 35% per report from [**2155-6-1**].
His metoprolol was held throughout his hospitalization given his complete heart block.
# Hypothyroidism: Stable, continued outpt meds.
# Diabetes Mellitus: His blood glucose levels remained below 240 on SSI and below 150 the last few days of his hospitalization.
Transitional Issues - reassess need for antipsychotics, mental status may be improving and may not have long-term need - assess volume status daily and daily weights, consider increasing lasix dose if weight increasing or appears hypervolemic - consider pacemaker placement for heart block and anticoagulation for both paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and LV aneurysm at cardiology followup visit - Continue ceftriaxone 2 gm daily until [**2155-7-10**] and weekly CBC/diff and ESR/CRP to be faxed to infectious disease nurses at [**Hospital1 69**] #Full code as per HCP, nephew, [**Name (NI) 449**] [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 976**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 111744**].
