An echocardiogram in [**2120-4-7**] showed severe aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 112mmHg across the valve as well as moderate regurgitation.
She does note some dyspnea on exertion however she continues to particpate in [**Last Name (un) 91633**] and weight lifting.
Given the severity and progression of her disease, she is now referred for surgical consultation.

No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is prominent septal hypertrophy extending into the LVOT.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is no evidence of a peri-valvular leak.
There is no evidence of aortic dissection.
[**2120-9-5**] CXR: PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright position.
Status post sternotomy and significant postoperative cardiac enlargement as before.
Pulmonary congestive pattern; however, has decreased and there is no evidence of acute pulmonary infiltrates.
Still, the diaphragms are concealed by bilateral pleural effusions that blunt the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses.
Also identified on the lateral view are the metallic components of a porcine aortic valve prosthesis in place and multiple surgical clips in the left anterior mediastinum related to the previous bypass surgery.
A right internal jugular approach central venous line remains in place and terminates overlying the SVC at the level 2 cm below the carina.
The pleural spaces were free and the now existing pleural effusions are considered to be of moderate degree.
No pneumothorax is seen in the apical area.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
On post-op day 4 she had an episode of atrial fibrillation and was given beta-blocker and amiodarone with good response.
By the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
