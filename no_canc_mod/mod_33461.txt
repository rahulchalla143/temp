[**2181-3-15**] chest AP x-ray: Low lung volumes are noted, with mild crowding of bronchovascular markings.
The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema.

[**2181-3-15**] N/C head CT: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.
# Altered mental status: Appears to be related to drug overdose.
TCA positive on Serum tox, but no EKG changes so less likely to be toxic from TCA.
No clear toxic prodrome fits this clinical picture as patient without tachycardia, hypertension and diaphoresis (sympathomimetics); agitation, tachycardia, flushing (anticholinergics); miosis, lack of response to narcan (opiods); or autonomic instability, clonus, tremors (serotonin syndrome).
No dramatic anion gap, so less likely ethylene glycol or methanol toxicity.
The patient was intubated in the ED for somnolence and maintained with mechanical ventilation.
# Sinus tachycardia: stably tachycardic.
Not responsive to fluid boluses.
