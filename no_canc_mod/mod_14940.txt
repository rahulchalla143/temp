Family History: (+) FHx CAD  Physical Exam: 97.1  97 SR  90/60  92% RA sats WDWN, NAD A+Ox3, MAE CTAB, good resp effort, no wheeze, crackles or rales Distant heart sounds, RRR, no m/r/g soft, nt, nd, nabs, small umbilical hernia LE warm, Distal DP/PT pulses 2+ Carotids 2+ pulses, no bruits.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
3.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Central jet with a wide base.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
Mitral regurgitation persists.
[**2168-6-20**] Lower Extremity Ultrasound Extremely limited study due to patient's body habitus and central line with overlying dressings obscuring the common femoral veins.
There is no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the proximal and mid SFV, or the popliteal veins.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a large pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**2168-6-21**] Liver Ultrasound Secondary to subcutaneous gas from recent surgical procedure, no ultrasound evaluation can be made of the intra-abdominal organs.
Assess for mediastinitis.
There are associated postoperative changes in the anterior chest.
However, on today's examination, just anterior to the heart, there appears to be a low- density area with diffuse fat stranding, particularly along the inferior margin which is suspicious for inflammatory.
There are diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications of the right coronary, left anterior descending, and left circumflex arteries respectively.
There are multiple prominent lymph nodes in the prevascular space, the largest of which measures 11 mm in short-axis dimension (4:64).
The largest collection is located superiorly and measures 6.2 x 3.5 cm and has a mildly denser rim.
There is a small-to-moderate left pleural effusion which may contain some proteinaceous material as it is higher in attenuation than simple fluid.
There is associated mild compressive atelectasis.
The left lower lobe pleural effusion is not significantly changed compared to the previous examination.
There is right lower lobe atelectasis which also appears unchanged compared to the previous examination.
There is a small, 3-mm pulmonary nodule within the right middle lobe, lateral aspect (3:34).
Limited views of the lung bases again demonstrate bilateral adrenal nodules which are incompletely imaged.
A right-sided nodule measures approximately 1.3 x 1.0 cm.
There is at least one calcification within the head of the pancreas.
No foci of air within the mediastinum to suggest mediastinitis.
However, there is increased fluid-soft tissue density material within the anterior mediastinum amidst multiple surgical clips that appears new compared to [**2168-7-3**].
New, two simple-appearing fluid collections in the superior aspect of the left upper lobe with associated pleural thickening consistend with a left upper lobe loculated pleural effusion.
Persistent moderate left pleural effusion and associated atelectasis versus consolidation.
Persistent right lower lobe atelectasis.
Bilateral adrenal nodules, unchanged compared to [**2168-7-3**].
Followup is recommended in [**3-22**] months if these do not meet criteria for adenoma by CT.  5.
A 3 mm right middle lobe nodule should be evaluated in [**3-22**] months to confirm stability.
DR. [**First Name (STitle) 2618**] [**Doctor Last Name **] DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 21884**]      Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 59042**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2168-6-15**] via transfer from [**Hospital6 **] for surgical management of his coronary artery disease.
He developed atrial fibrillation which was treated with amiodarone and cardioversion.
As Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 59044**] hemodynamics were poor an echocardiogram was obtained which showed some pericardial effusion.
Mr. [**Known lastname 59042**] required aggressive diuresis for fluid overload.
Respiratory: From a respiratory standpoint, Mr. [**Known lastname 59042**] [**Last Name (Titles) 59045**] with acidosis, hypoxemia and failure to wean from the ventilator.
On postoperative day four, he developed ventilator associated pneumonia.
Culutures revealed pseudomonas aeruginosa for which cefepime was started.
Mr. [**Known lastname 59042**] developed subcutaneous emphysema after his chest closure and chest tubes were positioned accordingly with slow resolution of his emphysema.
Mr. [**Known lastname 59043**] was treated for pseudomonas Ventilator Acquired Pneumonia(VAP) with intravenous cefepime.
Flagyl was started empirically for C. Diff prevention.
A blood culture from [**2168-7-2**] grew vancomycin resistent enterococcus and a catheter tip grew gram negative rods.
At the same time, a swab from his lower portion of his sternal wound grew enterococcus as did a blood culture.
On [**2168-7-10**] he drew gram negtive rods on his central line tip and cefepime was resumed.
Wound Care: As Mr. [**Known lastname 59042**] developed some skin breakdown and ulcers from being incapacitated.
He also had lower sternal drainage and the lower portion of his wound was opened.
Renal: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) **] developed postoperative renal failure.
Gastrointestinal: Mr. [**Known lastname 59042**] abdomen was distended postoperatively in the presence of rising liver enzymes and leukocytosis.
A CT scan showed a fecoloaded rectum and an elarged gallbladder with pericholecystic fluid.
He was transfused with multiple blood products.
He was taken to the catheterization lab for an angiogram where successful coil embolization of left sided rectal arteries and successful coil embolization of perineal branches of the left internal iliac artery was performed.
is to return to [**Hospital 409**] Clinic on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2 on Wed. [**7-27**] to have all wounds checked.
