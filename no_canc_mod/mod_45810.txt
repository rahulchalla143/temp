The computerized tomography scan revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, predominantly at the lung bases, where there is complete collapse, consolidation, cardiomegaly and, coronary artery calcifications.
The patient has been evaluated by the Pulmonary Service due to her persistent carbon dioxide retention and likely contraction alkalosis.
The Pulmonary Team felt that the patient had a primary contraction alkalosis along with primary respiratory acidosis that were compensating eachother.
The Pulmonary Team also thought that the patient's respiratory acidosis was mostly related to the large bilateral effusions that were increasing her work of breathing and causing her to produce more carbon dioxide and allowing her to blow off her carbon dioxide.
Therefore her right pleural effusion was tapped and drained and studies were sent to rule out empyema or parapneumonic effusion.
Two days later, the patient had her left effusion taped dry and similar studies were sent.
The patient's respiratory acidosis improved slowly as well as the contraction alkalosis.
The patient's oxygen requirement resolved at the time of discharge.
