Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after a fall where you sustained rib fractures [**6-8**] on the left side of your chest.
You also sustained a small area of lung collapse on the left side.
*  Your rib fractures can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the pain.
*  You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths.
If the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and notify your physician.
*  Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.
*  You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and deep breathing.
*  Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid and fiber intake if possible.
*  Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation around your ribs ( crepitus ).
