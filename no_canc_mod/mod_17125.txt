Yesterday he reportedly had several episodes of vomiting but this improved somewhat by this morning.
He brought him to [**Location (un) **] where he was tachycardic and hypotensive to 70/60.
He was given Vanco/Levo/Flagyl/gent and Decadron for presumed sepsis and was intubated, presumably for airway protection and for sedation for scanning (according to his daughter).
Abd CT showed a distended colon with fluid and fecal material, no bowel wall thickening or edema and no pneumatosis; mild pericolic fat induration in the left lateral mid abdomen and proximal to mid descending colon; and fecal impaction in the rectum.
He received 6L IVF resuscitation and peripheral dopamine was started for hypotension to the 70s.

Dilated loops of large bowel with air-fluid levels suggestive of [**Last Name (un) 3696**] or large bowel obstruction.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.
1.2 cm hypodensity in the spleen, which is not characterized well on this non-contrast study, but likely a hemangioma.
Cholelithiasis, without CT evidence of cholecystitis.
The source of sepsis was unclear.
However, bowel etiology was likely given the abdominal distension on physical exam.
Other possible etiology considered were PNA or urosepsis.
The patient was evaluated by surgery for possible intervention, however the decision was made not to go to the OR immediately as there was no clear indication and the pt.
performance status was poor and was high risk for surgery.
