There is no pneumothorax or apical hematoma.
The heart size is markedly enlarged but stable.
There is no change in the mediastinal contours.
Small amount of pleural effusion decreased compared to [**2177-4-18**].
IMPRESSION:  1) Cardiomegaly, no evidence of failure.
2) Decreased pleural effusion, small.
3) Standard position of right internal jugular line.
Valvular heart disease.
Severely dilated LV cavity.
Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction.
No LV mass/thrombus.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity.
AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with thinning and akinesis of septum, anterior and lateral walls, and hypokinesis of the remaining segments.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated, and right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
The aortic root is moderately dilated athe sinus level.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe systolic dysfunction.
Borderline-mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Normally-functioning mitral valve bioprosthesis.
Moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
No prior examinations.
LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY DEEP VENOUS ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler examination of the left internal jugular vein, subclavian, axillary, brachial, cephalic, and basilic veins was performed.
These demonstrate intraluminal thrombus with the left cephalic vein with expansion of the vein suggestive of acute clot.
The remainder of the veins demonstrates normal compressibility, augmentability, and respiratory variation and flow.
IMPRESSION: Left cephalic vein thrombus extending to the confluence with the subclavian vein, presumably due to recent IV line.
DIAGNOSIS:    Mitral valve, valvuloplasty:  Valve leaflet with myxoid degeneration.
No significant calcifications are grossly noted.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2177-4-7**] for surgical management of his valvular heart and coronary artery disease.
On [**4-8**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] performed a redo-sternotomy with coronary artery bypass grafting and a mitral valve replacement with a 31 mm [**Company 1543**] mosaic porcine valve.
Due to persistent blood glucose levels, the [**Last Name (un) **] service was consulted to assist in the postop management of his type II diabetes mellitus.
Ultrasound revealed a left cephalic vein thrombus extending to the confluence with the subclavian vein.
Argatroban anticoagulation was subsequently started with slow transition to Warfarin.
Further evaluation included a lower extremity ultrasound which found no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.
The cardiology service was consulted to assist in the management on his congestive heart failure and diuretic regimen.
He also experienced sternal drainage with a leukocytosis.
He eventually became therapeutic on Warfarin with appropriate Argatroban overlap.
