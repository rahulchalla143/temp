Patient initially presented to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital early yesterday morning with fevers and chest congestion starting the night prior.
[**Name (NI) **] wife states that she was sick with URI symptoms and suspects that she may have infected him.
He was initially admitted to the medicine floor at [**Hospital1 1474**] with a diagnosis of viral pneumonia based on a positive influenza DFA.
Over the course of the day, however, he became more febrile and hypotensive, with hypoxia to the 80s-90s and became more obtunded on exam.
Past Medical History: Alzheimer's dementia--baseline oriented to wife, conversational; needs assist with bathing, dressing Congestive heart failure Atrial fibrillation  NKDA  Social History: Lives at home with his wife.
No oral ulcers.
No murmurs or rubs.
No rhonchi or wheezes.
Neuro: Unresponsive to sternal rub or loud voice.

No pneumothorax or mediastinal widening.
Dense consolidation in the left lower lobe accompanied by a small left pleural effusion is stable.
There is new opacification at the right lung base which could represent another region of atelectasis or aspiration.
No pneumothorax.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis/akinesis (LVEF = 20 %).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe global left ventricular hypokinesis/akinesis.
Mild mitral regurgitaiton.
Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No prior echo for comparison.
CT Head [**2-11**]: There is no evidence of mass, mass effect or large acute territorial infarct, however, acute/subacute ischemic changes cannot be completely excluded, MRI is recommended if clinically warranted.
In the brain parenchyma, there are multiple areas with low density in the subcortical white matter, likely consistent with microvascular ischemic changes.
Dense arteriosclerotic calcifications noted in both carotid siphons as well as in the left vertebral artery as described above.
Mucosal thickening is identified in the maxillary sinuses with mucous retention cysts, there is also mucosal thickening in the sphenoidal, ethmoidal and left mastoid air cells as described above.
Moderately large left retroperitoneal hematoma expanding the left psoas and quadratus lumborum.
No evidence of bowel obstruction.
Sigmoid diverticulosis without definitive evidence of acute diverticulitis.
Left greater than right bibasilar pleural effusions.
Hypoattenuating segment II liver lesion likely represents a cyst.
Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion and probable small right pleural effusion are unchanged.
New faint ill-defined opacity in the right upper lobe could be due to aspiration given the clinical history.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 7518**] is a 79 yo M w/PMHx sx for CHF and dementia admitted with respiratory failure in the setting of viral pneumonia secondary to influenza.
[**1-30**] viral pneumonia.
Although he was initially treated with antibiotics for possible bacterial superinfection, he was transitioned to nafcillin for bronchial washings positive for MSSA.
During his course in the ICU, he developed new leukocytosis in the setting of having NG tube placed.
He was started on vancomycin/cipro/zosyn to cover possible aspiration pneumonia or hospital aquired pneumonia.
Septic shock.
Felt to be due to viral pneumonia with associated fever, bandemia, tachycardia, hypotension.
His septic physiology resolved over time.
Patient with elevated troponin, with lateral <[**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions on EKG.
Patient had AF with RVR initially in the setting of fever and respiratory distress.
Evidence of demand ischemia resolved with improved control of heart rate.
Atrial fibrillation.
Beta blockade for rate control.
Initially on coumadin, which was held when his INR became elevated to 7.
His heparin was held on [**2-12**], when a retroperitoneal bleed was identified on CT Abdomen and pelvis ordered because of concern for obstruction (there was no evidence of obstruction on CT).
Of note, patient had had elevated INR to 7.5 early in his course.
Altered Mental Status - myoclonus and delerium: Patient was noted to have myoclonal jerking after extubation.
Neurology was consulted about the myoclonus, and he was felt to have a toxic-metabolic process in the setting of his infection, sepsis, and sedating medications.
CNS CT imaging was negative for acute changes.
EEG was consistent with widespread encephalopathy; there was no evidence of epileptiform activity.
CT of head showed no stroke.
Our hope is that mental status may improve somewhat, but to what extent is questionable, given baseline of severe dementia.
He has periods of somnolence alternating with spontaneous one or two word response.
# Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient noted to have decreased EF to LVEF 20%, global hypokinesis  In setting of influenza, ICU team was concerned that he might have viral cardiomyopathy.
Ischemic event also possible.
He will need regular weight checks and consideration of diuresis if any significant increase in weight.
Mild elevation wtih slightly increased CK's, CK down to 500's today, good UOP.
# Alzheimer's Dementia:  Severe dementia, requiring help dressing and showering before current illness.
Namendia and aricept held for now at suggestion of geriatrics team.
#Aspiration risk: Swallow eval with aspiration risk.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 15290**] [**Hospital 2481**] Care Center  Discharge Diagnosis: pneumonia: influenza, then [**Hospital 78166**] hospital acquired pneumonia atrial fibrillation hypersensitivity reaction (rash) dementia, severe benign hypertension   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Please [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD or return to ER with any fevers, dizziness, or other concerning symptoms.
