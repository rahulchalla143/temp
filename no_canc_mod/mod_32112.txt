IDENTIFICATION:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname 76665**] is a newborn infant with known diagnosis of complete atrioventricular canal defect with hypoplastic left heart, who is being transferred from the [**Hospital1 69**] Neonatal Intensive Care Unit to the [**Hospital3 1810**] cardiac intensive care unit.
This pregnancy was complicated by a diagnosis of complex congenital haert disease at approximately 18 weeks gestation with fetal echocardiogram at that time showing unbalanced atrioventricular canal defect with hypoplastic left ventricle, aortic arch hypoplasia and a large atrial septal defect.
Quad screen was performed which showed a low risk of Trisomy.
Fetal growth had been appropriate until just the week prior to delivery when mild growth restriction was noted.
Cesarean section was eventually performed under general anesthesia due to inadequate epidural level.
There was no maternal fever and no sepsis risk factors were noted.
At delivery, the infant emerged stunned with poor tone and respiratory effort.
At approximately 2 to 3 minutes of life, the infant became vigorous with a strong respiratory effort and a strong cry.
In general, infant was well developed and nondysmorphic, vigorous with mild work of breathing.
Neck was supple without lesions.
Chest was clear to auscultation with moderate aeration and mild retractions.
Abdomen was soft without hepatosplenomegaly.
Infant remained hemodynamically stable throughout the monitoring period in the NICU, with mild retractions but overall comfortable respiratory status.
Complete atrioventricular canal defect with hypoplastic     left ventricle.
Mild transient tachypnea of the newborn.
Mild neonatal depression resolved.
