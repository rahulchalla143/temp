Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
The left main coronary artery had a distal 50% stenosis with moderate calcification.
The LAD had a mid vessel total occlusion with a heavily calcified D1 total occlusion and faint distal filling.
The LCX had a 60 to 70% stenosis of the AV groove vessel with a distal total occlusion.
The OM2 had a mid vessel 90% stenosis and the OM1 had an 80% stenosis at its origin.
The RCA was severely calcified throughout (though the presence of previously placed stents could not be excluded) with a 60% stenosis proximally, 50% stenosis in the mid vessel, and diffuse disease in the PDA and RPL up to 80%.
Resting hemodynamics revealed minimally elevated right sided filling pressures (mean RA pressure was 9 mm Hg and RVEDP was 11 mm Hg).
Left sided filling pressures were minimally elevated (mean PCW pressure was 15 mm Hg).
During one episode of suctioning, the patient was noted to have a significant drop in his systemic pressures to the 40s systolic with no palpable pulse.
A stat echocardiogram was performed and revealed depressed myocardial function, a thickened aortic valve, and a mean aortic valve gradient of 20 mm Hg.
No aortic insufficieny or significant pericardial effusion was noted.
An IABP was placed though there was no systolic unloading secondary to the patient's tachycardia.
Post cardiac arrest, the patient had moderately elevated pulmonary artery pressures (PA pressure was 62/38 mm Hg).
Severe three vessel and branch coronary artery disease.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Moderately to severely elevated left sided filling pressures post cardiac arrest.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a tiny to small pericardial effusion, mostly over the right ventricle.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably moderately depressed; ejection fraction difficult to assess due to the presence of bigeminy (EF ?35%).
There is at least mild aortic valve stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
GI BLEEDING STUDY  [**2183-6-4**] Blood flow images show no areas of abnormal tracer accumulation.
Delayed blood pool images for 90 minutes obtained immediately after injection of tracer show no areas of abnormal tracer accumulation.
Delayed blood pool images obtained six hours after injection of tracer show accumulation of tracer in the right colon and hepatic flexure, with subsequent progression of tracer into the transverse colon.
Angiographic demonstration of an area of angiodysplasia in the ascending colon, just inferior to the hepatic flexure.
Two vasa recta supplying this lesion were successfully embolized with microcoils, with good immediate arteriographic result.

Ischemia: PT with NSTEMI at OSH.
This was likely in the setting of superimposed PNA on COPD.
With NSTEMI as well as pt got anticoagulated, he bled further (bronchiectasis)leading to a bigger stress as well as PEA and coded.
Catheterization showed 3VD and initially it was thought that pt needed high risk intervention vs. CABG.
Cardiac surgery was consulted in the cath lab and at that point as pt was intubated, had just had PEA arrest and was hemoptysizing, they deferred.
Reconsulted cardiac surgery given stabilization a few days later but given high comorbidities it was decided that risk outweighed the benefit.
Pt was initially on heparin and Integrilin that was d/d/cd secondary to hemoptysis.
Additionally, pt was started on ACEi and BB a few days in to hospitalization, but these were d/cd when he was hypotensive again and GIB (See below).
Ultimately, as patient's blood pressure improved following resolution of multiple infections, patient was able begin medical managment of coronary artery disease with lisinopril and metoprolol as well as continuing atorvastatin and aspirin.
Irrespective, following catherization, patient had no further episodes of myocardial ischemia or angina.
b. Pump/Hypotension: Pt had initially been unable to maintain pressures without supportive care.
On HD #11, pt had hypotension requiring re-starting Levophed to maintain MAPs, which were d/cd later that day.
Indeed, patient was found to be adrenally insufficient, likely secondary to long-standing corticosteroid treatment for sarcoidosis and COPD, and required a brief high dose hydrocortisone pulse which immediately improved hypotension.
Although throughout hospitalization, patient had several episodes of CHF exacerbation/flash pulmonary edema, at the time of discharge, patient was euvolemic.
Following clinical stabilization, echocardiography was repeated, which, although a poor study given ventricular bigeminy, revealed an EF of 35% and mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension was identified.
c. Rhythm: Pt with PEA in cardiac cath lab & resuscitated.
He was tachycardic in the 140s at admission, likely due to fever, sepsis , and low stroke volume.
Over the course of hospitalization, however, patient had three episodes of NSVT without further episodes of cardiac arrest.
In addition, patient had intermittent episodes of ventricular bigeminy without degeneration of rhythm or hemodynamic compromise.
Following hemodynamic stabilization with resolution of infections, patient was uptitrated on metoprolol given unrevascularized CAD without issues.
Pulm: Pt was intubated secondary to hypercarbic resp failure in likely setting of MI, ?
sepsis/infection, and long standing severe COPD.
Of note, sarcoidosis was felt to be stable throughout this hospitalization.
a. Vent: During coronary catheterization, patient was found to have severe intrinsic PEEP, likely contributing to both hemodynamic and respiratory compromise around the time of the PEA arrest.
Question of if pt met criteria for ARDS though could not exclude a cardiac cause of b/l pulmonary infiltrates completes and ARDSNET protocol ventilation was administered.
Following tracheostomy placment, patient was quickly weaned to minimal pressure support and initiated on daily trach collar trials and successfully fitted for Passey-Muir valve.
Of note, patient continued to require intermittent pressure support and/or assist control ventilation secondary to fatigue at the time of discharge.
He was double covered for gram (-) w/Zosyn, Levaquin, and vancomycin but tapered to Levaquin  alone when sputum grew out H. flu.
BCX from cath lab grew coag neg staph but only one bottle (so thought to be contaminant).
On HD #11, pt had hypotension to 80s systolic.
He also had an increase in sputum production and was pan-cultured.
At that point, a ventilator associated pneumonia was high on the differential.
Chest CT that day showed LLL PNA & bilat atelectasis & small pleural effusions (?aspiration).
Course was further complicated by development of MRSA ventilator associated pneumonia which was treated with vancomycin for a full two week course.
However, at the end of that course, patient again was febrile with a transient hypotensive episode, and patient was started on linezolid 600BID for an additional seven day course.
Following that initial febrile episode, patient was afebrile and normotensive for the remaining hospital course.
d. Sarcoidosis- Inactive during this hospitalization, however, bronchoscopy revealed a left lower lobe endobronchial nodule on the day prior to discharge.
e. Hemoptysis- On admission following cardiac catheterization, patient had episode of hemoptysis while on integrillin and heparin.
He had multiple episode of frank melena with blood clots.
PEG was placed at bedside on the day prior to discharge, as patient failed speech and swallow evaluation two days prior discharge.
Psych- Continued on outpatient dose of paxil - no issues.
Renal: Patient initially had acute renal failure, with creatinine max of 1.7.
Patient was able to ambulate with a walker on trach collar with assistance, was hemodynamically stable, and had no further febrile episodes.
Trazodone HCl 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Oxycodone HCl 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for pain for 7 days.
