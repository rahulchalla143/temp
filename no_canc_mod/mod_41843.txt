Denied lightheadedness, CP or SOB at home.
Has chronic DOE which is unchanged from baseline.
Mild nausea.
Patient denies NSAID use.
In the ED, digital rectal exam revealed maroon stool in rectal vault and NG Lavage was negative.
EGD done showed esophagitis, gastritis, duodenitis as well as Shatzki's ring.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: T 97.4, 140/70, 91, 24, 100% on 2L GEN - NAD, A&Ox3, slurred speech HEENT - PERRLA, EOMI, MMM NECK - no JVD HEART - nl s1s2, RRR, III/VI holosystolic murmur at apex and II/VI SEM at LUSB radiating to carotids LUNGS - CTAB ABD - soft, mildly distended, NT, NABS, no masses EXT - no edema  Pertinent Results: Labs on admission: [**2118-4-14**] 11:30 am Hct 31.5, WBC 4.3, Plts 128, INR 1.9                Na 146, K 4.0, Cl 112, CO2 22, BUN 27, Creat 0.9                CK 93, Trop T 0.01                UA negative  Studies: CXR [**2118-4-14**] Heart size is unchanged; bilateral small pleural effusion with atelectasis.
No CHF noted.
Esophagitis in the gastroesophageal junction.
Erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis.
Erythema in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
There are dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels without transition point.
A small amount of fluid around the liver, around the gallbladder and in the pelvis.
Persistent native portosystemic shunt.
(right posterior portal vein to right hepatic vein)  EEG [**2118-4-19**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of intermittent, focal delta frequency slowing involving the right anterior quadrant.
This finding suggests subcortical dysfunction in this region and is a relatively non-specific finding with regard to an evaluation for seizures.
In addition, the background rhythm is slowed with occasional generalized delta frequency slowing.
This finding suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and it is consistent with an encephalopathy.
Note was made of an irregular rhythm with occasional ectopy on the cardiac monitor.
No epileptiform abnormalities were seen.
2) Retrocardiac left lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation.
Squamous epithelium with active esophagitis and ulceration.
No neoplasm identified.
Colonoscopy [**2118-4-21**]: multiple non-bleeding diverticula in the entire colon and rectal varices.
Video Swallow [**2118-4-25**]: Video oropharyngeal swallow study: The study was performed in conjunction with the Speech and Swallow Service.
There was premature spillover of thin liquids through straw to the level of the piriform sinuses.
Bolus propulsion is mildly impaired.
There is a small amount of ground solid residue in puree consistent in the valleculae, which clears after a subsequent swallow.
However, there is moderate oral and mild pharyngeal dysphagia as described  Brief Hospital Course: 88 yo man with A fib on coumadin and CHF presents with melena and maroon stool in rectal vault.
EGD done in the ED revealed gastritis, esophagitis, and duodenitis with signs of recent bleeding but no active bleeding.
Patient transferred from floor after being intubated for airway protection secondary to altered mental status.
Felt that patient may have encephalopathy secondary to GI bleed.
He was given 6 liters of prep for a colonoscopy and put out very minimal stool.
Felt that patient may have partial bowel obstruction.
Patient had c-scope and EGD with push enteroscopy which was negative for any active bleeding.
During ICU course patient had witnessed aspiration after coughing out trach tube.
1) Esophagitis, Gastritis, Duodenitis - No signs/symptoms of active bleeding.
Patient denies recent NSAID use.
Likely related to encephalopathy precipitated by GIB (elevated ammonia) vs meds from EGD done in ED.
Likely with continued delirium after prolonged intubation and ICU stay.
As per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was independent of all ADL's, cooking, and driving.
- Head CT negative.
- EEG done on [**4-19**] with right anterior bursts of delta slowing amidst theta/delta background consistent with encephalopathy.
No epileptiform activity.
3) Cirrhosis noted on Abd CT (Abd CT from [**6-15**] with some evidence of cirrhosis).
- RUQ U/S ([**4-16**]) w/o ascites - unconjugated bili not elevated, therefore less likely related to cardiac congestion as per liver - continued on lactulose for goal of 3 BM's per day  4) Pneumonia - likely aspiration event when pt extubated.
Patient with sputum culture positve for pansensitive Pseudomonas and Klebsiella.
He was moinitored for complete heart block, as pt has significant underlying conduction disease.
His coumadin was d/c'ed given recent GI bleed (last INR 1.7).
6) CHF - known diastolic dysfunction, treated as outpt with lasix and lisinopril.
His lasix was dosed on a prn basis during this admission.
His lasix should be restarted if he appears fluid overloaded.
7) BPH - Terazosin restarted at discharge.
9) Hypernatremia and contraction alkalosis.
Continue to hold lasix as pt appears volume deplete.
10) Ileus noted on KUB while in ICU, resolved.
Pt had NGT to suction with bilious output in ICU.
He did well on a ground diet with thickened liquids.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: GI Bleed Aspiration Pneumonia Hepatic encephalopathy   Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: Please call your primary care physician or return to the hospital if you experience bleeding, confusion, shortness of breath, fever >101,4, or any other concerns.
Currently being held secondary to volume depletion.
Pt was on coumadin as an outpt for Afib, however currently being held for recent GI Bleed.
