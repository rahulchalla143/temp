Admission Date:  [**2116-3-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2116-3-12**]   Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Orthostatic hypotension.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 82-year-old male with a past medical history significant for benign prostatic hypertrophy (status post transurethral resection of the prostate in [**2092**]), gout, hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency ?, hypothyroidism and thrombocytopenia, status post cerebrovascular accident, and anemia requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells.
He was most recently hospitalization on [**2115-11-23**], during which time he was treated for dehydration and acute renal failure.
In addition, he was noted to have a left facial droop, and right tongue deviation, and MRI was ?
He has had a weight loss of approximately 20 pounds over the past six months.
He denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, or urinary signs or symptoms.
He denied any fevers, chills, nausea or shaking.
He did complain of dizziness when he changed positions from supine to standing or supine to sitting, but he denied any loss of consciousness and denied any confusion.
After the VNA found the patient to be orthostatic hypotensive, the patient was sent to the Emergency Department.
He was given aggressive intravenous fluids, and his orthostatic hypotension responded to three liters of intravenous fluids.
The patient continued to have profuse melena was admitted directly to the medical intensive care unit.
Cerebrovascular accident.
Transient ischemic attack.
Venous stasis ulcers.
Chronic renal insufficiency ?
Benign prostatic hypertrophy status post transurethral resection of the prostate in [**2092**].
Anemia requiring transfusion.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended abdomen.
No costovertebral angle tenderness.
Extremities: Lichenification of his hands with excoriation was noted; erythema with venous stasis of bilateral lower extremities, two small ulcers (1.5 cm), clearly demarcated, on the right lower extremity, well granulated, one ulcer on the left lower extremity/lateral calf, well granulated.
EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 99, left ventricular hypertrophy, normal intervals, no acute ST and T wave changes.
IMPRESSION:  An 82-year-old male with a history of cerebrovascular accident and dehydration who was noted to have orthostatic hypotension (standing blood pressure 40/palpable), when VNA visited him.
OGT lavage was done, which revealed no bright red blood, and only brown-tinged fluid, which cleared with lavage.
GI bleed:  The patient was admitted directly to the medical intensive care unit and was typed and crossed for blood, and was transfused initially five units on hospital night number one.
The question of an emergent/urgent endoscopy was approached again with GI and since the patient was hemodynamically stable, and his nasogastric lavage was negative, in the setting of a new large pneumothorax, and without obvious life-threatening active hemorrhage, GI deferred on endoscopy until the patient was more medically stable.
The patient will likely continue to have melena for a couple of weeks, until his entire GI system has been cleared out.
Given that the patient's hematocrit remained stable, there did not appear to be any active blood loss.
On [**2116-3-11**], one day after the chest tube was pulled, GI did an esophagogastroduodenoscopy to evaluate for the cause of upper GI bleed.
They found in the stomach, a single cratered nonbleeding 15 mm ulcer in the pylorus.
There were changes of the ulcer base consistent with ulcer healing.
There was no visible vessel.
There was distortion of the pylorus, and edema of the surrounding mucosa.
In addition, there was no aspirin, no Aggrenox, no non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs given.
The patient should not have any aspirin, Aggrenox, or any more non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, until further directed to do so by GI.
Pulmonary:  The [**Hospital 228**] medical intensive care unit course was complicated by an iatrogenic pneumothorax, which was caused status post numerous left subclavian central line placement attempts.
Initially, the chest tube had air leaks, which later resolved.
On [**2116-3-10**], cardiothoracic surgery pulled the chest tube, and a repeat chest x-ray obtained showed that the pneumothorax was slightly smaller in size.
Hematology:  The patient is a difficult crossmatch secondary to numerous antibodies.
It took several hours for the patient to be crossmatched for a unit, secondary to his numerous antibodies.
Acidosis:  The patient developed a nonanion gap acidosis (low bicarbonate of 17), hyperchloremic (117).
If possible, the patient should be continued on these compression stockings, which the patient says help his leg edema and oozing a great deal.
Prophylaxis:  The patient was given subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
and as it seemed that his GI bleeding had resolved, and hematocrit was stable, he was transitioned to sips of clears.
Ins and outs:  The patient has no history of coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure.
The patient did not show any signs of pulmonary edema or elevated jugular venous distension throughout his aggressive intravenous fluids hydration.
He is afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
Upper gastrointestinal bleed, secondary to pyloric ulcer.
Anemia, secondary to acute blood loss, requiring transfusion.
Venous stasis disease/leg ulcers.
Fifteen mm pyloric ulcer, showing evidence of healing.
Patient is absolutely not to use any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, or Aggrenox.
If there is evidence of decreasing hematocrit (patient's hematocrit is currently stable at the 29-31% range) to less than 26-27%, recommend investigation.
*THE PATIENT'S PAST MEDICAL HISTORY INCLUDES THROMBOCYTOPENIA AS WELL AS CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY.
THE PATIENT DOES NOT SHOW SIGNS OF THROMBOCYTOPENIA AT THIS POINT IN TIME.
IN ADDITION, THE PATIENT HAS A PAST MEDICAL HISTORY LISTED OF CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY.
THESE LABORATORY VALUES DO NOT REFLECT ANY ELEMENT OF CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY.
Absolutely no non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, or Aggrenox.
