The corpus callosum does not appear involved, though no sagittal FLAIR sequence is available.
There are no infratentorial lesions.
IMPRESSION: Numerous supratentorial white matter lesions without contrast enhancement, which are nonspecific.
These findings are compatible with autoimmune disease-related vasculitis or inflammatory demyelination, but they may also be seen in chronic small vessel ischemic disease and a range of other disorders.
Spinal cord signal abnormality extending from C6-C7 disc and inferiorly to the conus level, predominantly in the central portion of the cord involving the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter.
No expansion of the cord or enhancement identified.
The location and appearance of the signal abnormality are more in favor of an ischemic insult to the spinal cord.
No abnormal flow voids or associated findings in the vertebral bodies seen.
Mild multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical and thoracic region.
No evidence of Chiari malformation.

Heterogeneous, bilateral consolidation in the mid lung zones, improved from [**2193-9-15**].
In conjunction with the CT appearance, this may represent cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
Less likely etiologies include infectious pneumonia or vasculitis.

[**9-29**] AST-17, ALT-16, LDH-123, AlP-14, TBili-0.7 Aldolase-normal   Brief Hospital Course: In summary, this patient is a 62-year-old woman with ascending weakness and a sensory line in the setting of chronic pulmonary complaints and autoimmune arthritis.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course as narrated according to [**Last Name **] problem list is as follows:  # Rapid onset weakness: Quickly progressive over the last 48 hours involving the toes to the T2 level, with a lumbar puncture significant for greater than 350 WBCs (see above).
The underlying autoimmune arthritis (and possible lung dz), the rapid onset, and the band like abdominal pain was initially believed to be consistent with a transverse myelitis.
A longitudinal myelitis variant does exist and case reports have suggested association with Sjogren's disease.
That said, despite positivity for anti-Ro and anti-[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 32545**] detected earlier on a reflex rheumatologic panel, her constellation of symptoms does not conform to a diagnosis of Sjogren's or any other rheumatologic disorder.
A complete infectious and autoimmune workup, as displayed above, showed only positivity for anti-Ro and anti-La but no other serologies.
Her neurological examination improved initially but then plateaued, with a persisting T2 sensory level and weakness in the lower extremities with the left worse than the right and the proximal muscles worse than the distal muscles.
There was never marked weakenss in her upper extremities except for mild symmetric weakness of the deltoids bilaterally.
Cyclophosphamide therapy was considered, but a thorough review of the literature suggested that it would confer no benefit to her.
The presence of bronchiectasis suggested significant chronicity, consistent with the patient's slowly progressive history of shortness of breath.
The central, peri-vascular findings could be consistent with vasculitis.
Infection was considered but was deemed less likely without fevers and given the atypical distribution.
Pathology from a wedge resection at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital was reviewed at the [**Hospital3 2576**] [**Hospital3 **] pathology department and was consistent with cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
These slides were obtained and read internally at the [**Hospital1 18**] where they were confirmed to be classic for cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
# Abdominal pain: The patient initially presented with a band-like pain, which may have been secondary to the progressive myelitis.
The pain may also have been exacerbated by constipation, as she went more than 5 days at a time without moving her bowels.
# EKG: Qtc prolongation, T wave inversion.
There were no ACS symptoms ever.
Elevated ferritin, likely autoimmune disease, and normal MCV suggested an anemia of chronic inflammation.
# Mood: Ms. [**Known lastname 5942**] had intermittent periods of low mood associated with the chronic hospitalization.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Autoimmune Myelitis with comorbid SSA/SSB+ antibodies.
Bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP) Vancomycin-resistant urinary tract infection   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
You were admitted to the hospital after having asecending numbness and lower extremity weakness shortly after your lung biopsy.
This lung biopsy showed evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP).
As you know, a large lesion was also found in your spinal cord likely accounting for your symptoms.
As extensive panel of infectious, autoimmune and viral tests were sent on your spinal fluid and did not provide a definite cause for your symptoms.
There was evidence of inflammation in both your spinal fluid and your blood and your Sjogrens antibodies were positive.
We believe your likely had an autoimmune process causing a myelitis (inflammation of your spinal cord).
You were treated with steroids and plasmapheresis and your repeat spinal tap and blood markers showed less inflammation.
You will also need to continue linezolid for the next 10 days to treat your urinary tract infection.
