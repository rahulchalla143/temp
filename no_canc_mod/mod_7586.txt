Admission Date:  [**2139-5-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-5-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2066-2-22**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1032**] Chief Complaint: ?
seizure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: MRI, EEG   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 31390**] is a 73-year-old right-handed female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and probable right pontine lacunar stroke (she presented with right CN VI and VII palsies that have since resolved) in [**2137**] who was noted by her son on [**2139-5-6**] to be in her usual state of good health.
They were riding in the car, and at one point during the ride he asked her a question and got no response.
This was followed by a period of 15-20 minutes of confusion and extreme fatigue.
Her son noted no clonic activity, incontinence or tongue biting during the event.
She denies prior episodes consistent with her son's description of what occurred.
She denies prior episodes consistent with auras, or prior episodes of syncope or dizziness.
She denies recent headaches, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or changes in urination or bowel movements.
Past Medical History: 1) Likely right pontine lacunar stroke The patient was admitted in [**10/2137**] after developing blurred vision, diploplia worse with right gaze, and a right-sided facial droop.
MRI performed during this admission showed no acute territorial infarct within the brain, but did show scattered old lacunar infarcts within the cerebellar hemispheres, and chronic periventricular white matter changes that were noted were seen as evidence of stroke.
An extensive workup was done to evaluate whether her symptoms could be due to other causes (detailed in Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] discharge summary from [**2137-10-23**]), but all tests returned negative, and therefore the diagnosis of a small pontine stroke which was not seen on MRI is the most likely possibility.
Interestingly, an echocardiogram from [**2137-10-23**] revealed a small secundum atrial septal defect, but left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
2) Hypertension Diagnosed when she was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2137-10-19**] for likely lacunar stroke (blood pressure was 184/90 upon admission).
3) Borderline diabetes Patient reports that she was told that her blood glucose was elevated when admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2137-10-19**].
4) Hyperlipidemia Lipid panel during [**2137-10-19**] admission revealed LDL elevated at 117.
Likely essential tremor, the most common neurologic cause of postural or action tremor (estimated prevalence worldwide of up to 5 percent of the population) given that she has a family history, it started in her youth, and has not progressed to include other neurologic symptoms.
Head tremor, which she has, is more likely to be a manifestation of essential tremor, whereas tremor of the jaw or lips is more typically parkinsonian.
6) Frostbite In both feet, many years ago  7) S/p bilateral cataract surgery  8) S/p right lumpectomy for benign breast lesion roughly 20 years ago.
Does not engage in formal exercise but spends a lot of time playing actively with her children, especially since retirement.
Father died of coronary artery disease.
Denies family history of seizures or other neurologic disorders.
Pleasant, talkative, in no acute distress Neck: Supple, no JVD or lymphadenopathy.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Pulmonary: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, anteriorly, without wheezes or rhonchi Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, without palpable masses Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, edema GU: Foley catheter in place, draining dark yellow urine  NEUROLOGIC EXAM([**2139-5-7**] at 9:30pm, upon transfer from SICU to floor): Mental Status: Patient is awake, alert, and fully oriented.
She is attentive, able to say the months of the year backwards clearly and without hesitation.
No signs of apraxia: patient is able to bring right hand to left ear and point to ceiling without difficulty.
No extinction or evidence of left-sided neglect.
CN III, IV, VI: extraocular muscles intact, without nystagmus or ptosis.
CN V: intact to light touch throughout CN VII: Smile symmetric, facial movements intact CN VIII: hearing intact to finger rub bilaterallyl CN IX, X: palate rises symmetrically CN [**Doctor First Name 81**]: Trapezius and sternocleidomastoid intact.
No pronator drift or signs of asterixis.
Vibration mildly decreased in bilateral lower extremities.
Coordination: Finger-to-nose testing revealed slight bilateral tremor (consistent with known history of probable essential tremor) but no ataxia.
Gait: Unable to walk far because of IV pole, but few steps revealed a narrow-based gait that was slightly unsteady.

Head CT [**5-6**]: Probable tiny chronic small vessel infarct in the right periatrial white matter.
MRI scanning recommended for better detection of a seizure focus.
Head CTA [**5-6**]: No definite signs for basilar artery stenosis or occlusion.
Head MR/MRA [**5-6**]: No acute infarct.
There is FLAIR sulcal hyperintensity which can be seen with leptomeningeal processes or high inspired FIO2.
Head MR [**5-7**]:  No significant change since prior study.
Stable probable small vessel ischemic sequela.
Mild stable sulcal hyperintensities which can be seen with leptomeningeal processes or high inspired FiO2.
No evidence for leptomeningeal enhancement seen.
The patient became hypotensive and Propofol was discontinued.
She was hemoconcentrated (hematocrit 52.1) and acidotic (bicarb 13 with anion gap of 29) upon arrival; both of these abnormalities were resolved on the morning of [**5-7**] after IV hydration.
Cardiac enzymes drawn to rule out MI returned normal.
CXR revealed no evidence of cardiopulmonary abnormality.
MRI, MRA, CT, and CTA showed no evidence of acute infarct, mass, or vascular abnormality.
EEG showed delta slowing but no epileptiform discharges.
On the morning of [**5-7**], the patient was extubated without difficulty, and no apparent neurologic or other deficits were noted.
It is likely that the patient had a seizure from a site of an old stroke given her vascular risk factors.
However, because she lives alone, we presented her with the option of starting a medicaion to prevent a future seizure.
The patient elected not to start an antiepileptic medication at this time, with the understanding that if she did in fact have a second seizure, the chance of having recurrent seizures would rise exponentially and she would likely need to start a medication at this time.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Seizure likely secondary to an old stroke   Discharge Condition: Good - no deficits   Discharge Instructions: Please take all your medications as directed and attend your follow up appointments.
You should also avoid heights or any situation that would put you at risk for falling should you have another seizure.
