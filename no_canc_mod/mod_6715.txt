On postoperative day #3, the patient was noted to have sternal drainage, respiratory distress, and acute hypotension.
Chest x-ray shows a widen mediastinum, but no obvious blood.
A transesophageal echocardiogram showed no tamponade and the decision was made to take the patient to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy and exploratory thoracotomy, at which point no intraabdominal blood was noted and no retroperitoneal blood was noted, but there was distention of the colon noted per the General Surgery team.
Transplant Surgery was consulted intraoperatively, and they noted enlarged fatty liver with significant venous congestion.
Plastic Surgery was consulted, and an omental flap transposition with bilateral bifemoral muscle flaps was done for sternal closure.
Three days later on [**4-2**], the patient was noted to have a right sided wound suture line disruption for which the patient underwent a sternal wound exploration and reclosure of the VAC on [**4-7**] after the patient had undergone enough diuresis for such a procedure.
The patient was placed on strict bed rest for the Plastic Surgery team in order to attempt to resect the wound closure.
The patient subsequently had an uncomplicated resolution of his hospital stay as he was able to tolerate regular diet and had good pain control with oral pain medications, and was eventually allowed to ambulate with strict sternal precautions, and felt to be ready to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility on [**2132-4-18**].
