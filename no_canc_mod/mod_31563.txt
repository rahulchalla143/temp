Admission Date:  [**2164-3-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2164-4-2**]   Service:  [**Hospital1 212**] MEDICINE  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86-year-old female with a past medical history significant for hypertension and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin with bilateral lower extremity edema who was originally referred to the Emergency Room from her PCPs office for increased lower extremity edema.
There was no loss of consciousness at that time.
She does report increased frequency of falling at home over the past three weeks.
Besides having no loss of consciousness she also reports no memory deficits.
She had a headache, no nausea or vomiting, neck stiffness in the last two days.
In the Emergency Room, a CT scan was performed which showed a small right frontal subdural hematoma.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Atrial fibrillation.
Bilateral lower extremity edema.
No pronator drift.
Cardiovascular: Irregularly/irregular, II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.
Lungs:  A few crackles at the bilateral bases, good air movement.
Extremities:  There was 4+ pitting edema of the bilateral lower extremities above the hips.
The initial chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly and mild vascular redistribution.
The EKG showed atrial fibrillation.
The head CT showed a right subdural hematoma, subacute.
ASSESSMENT:  This is an 86-year-old female with a history of hypertension and A fib on Coumadin with a subdural hematoma status post fall at home.
There, in the MICU, the primary concern was lowering the patient's INR from the admission INR of 2.3 down to below 1.3 for her subdural hemorrhage.
Her MICU course was then complicated by flash pulmonary edema with A fib and rapid ventricular response.
The patient received frequent neurologic checks and was deemed stable from a neurosurgery standpoint.
They decided that there was no need to evacuate the hematoma at this time and that could be followed.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was with increasing lower extremity edema and CHF like symptoms.
The patient also had an episode of flash pulmonary edema after receiving FFP in the MICU for which she received additional Lasix.
She also was in an A fib rhythm throughout her hospital course with one episode of RVR which had to be controlled with a Diltiazem drip.
The patient continued to have A fib throughout her hospital course; however, only that one episode of rapid ventricular response.
Right ventricular wall cavity was markedly dilated with depressed systolic function.
There was physiologic mitral regurgitation and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.
There was borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior report of [**2160-1-1**], the right ventricle had become dilated and the function decreased.
PT/OT:  The patient was evaluated by the PT and OT Service due to her recent increase in falls for her fall risk and also for general deconditioning.
ANEMIA:  The patient is with known history of iron-deficiency anemia.
The patient did have a low hematocrit during her hospital course of 23.6.
Subdural hemorrhage in the right frontal region.
Dilated right ventricle.
b.i.d., hold for loose stools.
The patient should have her electrolytes including potassium and creatinine checked every two to three days and have her electrolytes repleted appropriately.
