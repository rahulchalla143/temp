CXR ([**2120-8-10**]): LLL effusion .
ECHO: EF 40% LVH, LAD, mild MR, no new WMA .
ECG: sinus rhythm, RBBB with ST depressions in V2-V4 and terminal deflection in qrs but not significantly changed from prior tracings .
TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: Initial MDCT axial images through the abdomen were obtained for guidance for this patient's drainage.
The lung bases demonstrate bilateral dependent atelectases and small pleural effusions.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The gallbladder is markedly distended with gallstones.
Pericholecystic fluid and soft tissue stranding is noted.
There is a 2.3-cm hypodense nodule in the lower pole of the right kidney.
After explanation of the risks and benefits of the procedure, informed consent was obtained from the patient's wife.
There were no immediate complications.
Hypotrophic right kidney and bilateral renal hypodense lesions, not fully characterized on this non- contrast study.
Brief Hospital Course: 74M w/ CAD s/p CABGx2, DM, gout, [**Hospital 2091**] transferred from OSH with cholangitis and gallstones with positive troponins in the setting of ARF/CKD.
For his cholecystitis with ascending cholangitis: Pt was admitted from OSH after an extensive negative GI workup for RUQ pain on Unasyn, admitted after clearance of NSTEMI, for ERCP emergently.
Exploratory ECRP demonstrated gross pus in the stomach and spilling from the papilla, and a biliary stent was placed.
Amylase and lipase rose transiently suggestive of post ERCP pancreatitis but trended downwards by POD2.
Acute on chronic renal failure: He presented in prerenal ARF with Cr ~6, with likely component of oliguric ATN [**1-27**] CHF with kidney hypoperfusion.
He displayed indications for HD including acidemia, hyperkalemia, and uremic encephalopathy.
He received dialysis on [**2120-8-12**] for volume overload and 2L were taken off.
His AceI, colchicine, statin, lasix were held due to renal failure.
Mental status change: related to uremic encephalopathy given renal failure but there was also convern for bacteremia possible related to biliary sepsis.
NSTEMI: likely [**1-27**] to demand ischemia in the setting of infection and ARF/CKD, as opposed to NSTEMI.
Troponins were elevated from OSH on heparin gtt, peaking at trop 2.19 on ICU day 6 ([**2120-8-12**]).
ECG showed sinus rhythm, RBBB with ST depressions in V2-V4 and terminal deflection in qrs but not significantly changed from prior tracings.
Restrictive lung disease/COPD: OBstructive disease [**1-27**] COPD with superimposed Chest wall dysfunction [**1-27**] obesity and deconditioning and restarted on home atrovent and encouraged to use incentive spirometry.
Bilateral pleural opacities in LLL, RLL: Thought to be [**1-27**] fluid overload, atelectasis.
Gout: Patient has a history of gout, and had pain in his joints secondary to gout.
Anemia: normocytic Hct 30 down from baseline of 37-40, likely related to CKD, Fe deficiency given hx of GIB with possible malnutrition.
PVD: Hx of TIA, PVD, and carotid stenosis b/l.
CHF: ECHO from [**2115**] shows EF 50%, with inferior basal hypokinesis and the ECHO obtained in the ICU did not show interval development of wall mortion abnormalities.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Acute on chronic renal failure 2.
Acute cholecystitis 3.
Chronic systolic heart failure 5.
Diabetes mellitus   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: If you develop worsening shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, or confusion, call your primary care doctor or go to the emergency room.
