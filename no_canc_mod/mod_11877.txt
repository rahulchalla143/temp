Admission Date:  [**2141-5-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2141-5-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2064-10-30**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Keflex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**] Chief Complaint: s/p cardiopulmonary arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Mechanical Ventilation (previously trached) Central venous Catheter R SC placed [**5-6**] -> d/c'd and changed to PICC line left femoral A-Line placed [**5-6**] Chest tube removal  History of Present Illness: This is a 76 y/o male with with history of large right MCA and MCA/PCA watershed infarct in [**2-15**], likely cardioembolic due to his history of atrial fibrillation; cardiomyopathy with EF 15%; s/p MRSA pneumonia, now with E.coli pleural effusion; C.diff infection; and s/p recent trach and PEG on [**4-28**] for inability to wean vent from recurrent aspirations; found unresponsive at the [**Hospital1 **] Facility this morning.
This morning at rehab, at approximately 7:20 am he was found to be unresponsive and pulseless, but had a blood pressure of at least 100/60.
Upon initial exam, he was noted to flex his limbs to noxious stimuli, but his eyes were deviated up and to the left, and he had a "resting tremor" of the left arm, which was described as intermittent twitches of the arm that were not sustained or rhythmic.
Just before he was transported his nurse in the ED noticed more pronounced left arm twitching.
Upon arrival to the MICU, pt's VS were stable, however he was noticed to have left arm twitching and blood at the corner of his mouth.
Past Medical History: - Hypertension - hypercholesterolemia - disc bulge L4-5 w/o herniation - hx of osteomyelitis T12-11 [**2136**] - screening carotid study '[**37**]: bilateral mild to moderate carotid stenosis - s/p laminectomy thoracic spine - Cardiomyopathy with LVEF 10-15% - Ischemic MCA CVA [**2-15**] - Paroxsymal Afib - History of GI bleed - Aspiration PNA (patient failed speech and swallow in past) - CRI with baseline Cr 1.8-2.2 - s/p trach/PEG [**4-29**]   Social History: From [**Hospital **] rehab.
General: Unresponsive male with rightward eye gaze, biting down on tongue HEENT: Pupils pinpoint and non-reactive.
No doll's eye reflex.
Neck: supple, unable to assess JVD Chest: Diffue coarse rhonchi, right chest tubes in place CV: RRR s1 s2 distant, no murmurs appreciated Abdomen: obese, soft, active bowel sounds, PEG c/d/i Ext: +2 edema in LE and UE b/l; heel ulcer Neuro: Unresponsive except to noxius stimuli, pupils pinpoint and NR, trace corneal reflex.
There are multiple mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes, none of which are pathologically enlarged.
There is a right-sided pleural effusion that is small in size and decreased compared to prior study.
There is also atelectasis of the right lower lobe; the possbility of superimposed airspace disease cannot be excluded.
There is a tiny left pleural effusion.
Within the lung parenchyma, there is ground glass opacity diffusely thoughout the left lung, nonspecific, although the possibility of infection cannot be excluded.
Subcutaneous emphysema is seen along the chest tube tracts.
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Within the liver, there is a focal hypodense hepatic cyst within the left lobe measuring 19 mm.
Within the caudate lobe of the liver, there is an additional 8 x 14 mm hypodensity also likely representing hepatic cyst.
There is a small amount of perihepatic fluid.
There is thickening of the aderenal glands bilaterally without evidence of focal lesion.
There is no evidence of obstruction.
There is a small- to- moderate amount of fluid within the pelvis.
There is a rectal tube in place.
There is a moderate amount of soft tissue edema throughout the entire torso, most notable within the pelvis and proximal thighs.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ________________________________________________________________ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2141-5-6**] 12:58 PM FINDINGS: Again demonstrated is a large low-density area within the right MCA distribution consistent with a subacute/chronic infarction which is not significantly changed compared to prior study from [**2141-3-21**].
There are also linear hyperdense foci near the vertex of the posterior temporal region likely representing cortical mineralization secondary to the infarct.
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no shift of the midline.
IMPRESSION: Stable head CT with no evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage.
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ________________________________________________________________ Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2141-5-7**]  FINDINGS: PUSHBUTTONS: Five events were identified for periods of rhythmic  eye-blinking.
Apart from eye-blink artifact, no other changes in the EEG were seen.
The eye-blinking lasts for many seconds at a time, and in short periods between the eye-blinking, the EEG does not show signs of epileptiform activity.
When the eye-blinking stops, no epileptiform changes are seen.
AUTOMATED INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: Background activity consists of very low amplitude [**2-13**] Hz mixed delta and theta frequency slowing.
AUTOMATED SPIKE DETECTION: This algorithm captured 141 events, all for eye-blink artifact.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal 24 hour bedside telemetry due to the presence of extremely suppressed background activity.

# s/p cardiac arrest - PEA primary rhythm, thought to be secondary to hypoxia from mucous plugging or blood clots in trachea.
He had no signs of sepsis and blood cultures were all negative.
Troponin was elevated in the setting of renal failure but had no ECG changes.
He was continued on hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone for 7 days for presumed adrenal insufficiency which was started prior to arrival to the MICU.
The patient had no further cardiac arrhthymia during his MICU stay.
# Seizure/anoxic brain injury/stroke - Most likely [**1-13**] anoxic brain injury in setting of cardiac arrest and hypoperfusion to brain as well as later repeat MRI brain on [**5-10**] showed a new right posterior temporal/superior parietal/occipital regions, posterior to the chronic infarct, which was the culprit for seizure/twitching.
His twitching improved with dilantin but still continued to have intermittent eye twitching.
After 5 days of not showing any evidence of meaninful and/or purposeful responsiveness over the course of the MICU stay, neuro consultant felt that his prognosis for recovery was poor.
# Respiratory failure - in setting of recurrent aspiration [**1-13**] CVA, now trached and pegged.
Continued ventilation and aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet.
- Pt was continue on Aztreonam 1 gm q8 for E.coli PNA c/b empyema during last admission, course until [**2141-5-28**].
-  Chest tube # 2 was removed on [**2141-5-19**] after confirming no air leak and no further drainage.
However, Chest tube #1 continued to have air leak and drainage.
The right sided chest tube was placed to water seal on [**2141-5-22**] with a chest xray that showed a stable pneumothorax and no significant change or worsening with re-expansion of the right lung.
Please continue to keep chest tube in place until there is no longer an air leak present.
Please continue IV Vanco and IV Aztreonam for 2 additional weeks (end date [**2141-6-6**]) to complete a total of a 6 wk course of Abx for his empyema.
# h/o CHF - EF 15%, was on afterload agents including BB, Isordil, digoxin, hydralazine.
However, he had bleeding from trach site for which he underwent bronch on [**5-15**] and showed suction trauma with granulation tissues at the carina without any active bleeding.
He was given vitamin K. IP repeated bronch on [**5-16**] which only showed slight trach displacement with was repositioned and only saw granuation tissues.
He did have guaiac positive stool on [**4-19**] but lavage from PEG was negative for any coffee ground materials or blood.
- His hematocrit remained low at 24 but stable with no active issues.
# h/o C diff colitis - Flagyl was discontinued on arrival to the ICU given its ability to lower the seizure threshold.
He had no more recurrence of diarrhea and negative C. Diff cultures from [**2141-5-10**].
# A fib - The patient was in normal sinus rhythm on transfer.
Anticoagulation was held given the low hematocrit and concern for GI bleed in addition to acute stroke, ?
# CRI - Cr now stable at 1.5-1.6.
# F/E/N - with G tube on tube feeds, monitor lytes .
# PPx - heparin SC, famotidine .
# Access - R SC placed [**5-6**] -> d/c'd and changed to PICC line, left femoral A-Line [**5-6**] d/c'd .
# Communication - sister [**Name (NI) 382**], [**Name (NI) **]) [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 37628**] .
Artificial Tear with Lanolin 0.1-0.1 % Ointment [**Year (4 digits) **]: One (1) Appl Ophthalmic PRN (as needed).
Dose by levels as patient has renal failure.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Anoxic brain injury Cerebrovascular accident Congestive heart failure, EF 15% Empyema s/p chest tube Air leak in chest tube from likely bronchopleural fistula   Discharge Condition: Poor prognosis for neurologic recovery, non-purposeful movement of eyes.
Please have chest tube removed once there is no air leak present.
His Vancomycin has been dosed by daily levels as his renal failure has required q48 hour dosing.
