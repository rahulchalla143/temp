Admission Date:  [**2141-8-24**]     Discharge Date:  [**2141-9-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2068-3-31**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CAR [**Last Name (un) **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 73 year old with a history of coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**2120**] and also a history of severe mitral regurgitation with atrial fibrillation, severe cardiomyopathy with EF of approximately 10%.
Patient was admitted to the medicine service on [**8-24**] with congestive heart failure.
Despite medical care, patient made very little progress and subsequently was evaluated by cardiac surgery and underwent high risk mitral valve replacement operation on [**2141-9-7**].
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, chronic renal failure, anemia.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient was noted on admission to be awake and appropriate neurologically with decreased breath sounds at bilateral bases to suggest some failure.
Patient was tachycardiac with irregular heart beat.
Abdomen was soft, nondistended, nontender, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities had no evidence of edema.
The mitral replacement was a 29 mm [**Doctor Last Name **] porcine tissue heart valve through a right thoracotomy.
Given patient's low ejection fraction and poor risk for operation, patient's drips were turned down very slowly.
Initial plan was to have EPS place a pacer for her arrhythmia which was a/fib.
On [**9-14**] patient was suddenly hypotensive and severely acidotic which required her to go back on pressors which included Levophed, Neo-Synephrine, propofol as well as dopamine.
Moreover, her renal failure acutely decompensated which, at one point, made her not only oliguric, but also anuric for a few hours.
Given patient's history of a/fib, suspicion was made that perhaps patient had ischemic bowel or mesentery ischemia.
General surgery was then consulted who agreed that patient was at high risk for mesenteric ischemia and given her clinical picture, this may, indeed, be the diagnosis.
Therefore, patient was taken to the operating room and underwent exploratory laparotomy which, unfortunately, did not show any signs of ischemic bowel or any other intra-abdominal pathology to explain her sudden decompensation.
At this point the nephrology service was also consulted and they placed patient on CVVHD to help control her acidosis as well as her renal decompensation.
Patient underwent ultrasound which revealed thickened gallbladder wall, pericholecystic fluid and sludge in the gallbladder, all of which could be explained from previous laparotomy as well as her septic physiology.
Intraoperatively once again there was no obvious pathology found, however, a cholecystostomy tube was placed given the fact that patient had the ultrasound which suggested that she may have cholecystitis and she does have evidence of stones.
Her blood pressure remained very tenuous in the high 70s systolic blood pressure.
Family agreed at that point to make patient DNR and agreed to no escalation of her treatment.
Congestive heart failure with low ejection fraction.
Multiple organ failure including lung, kidney, liver.
