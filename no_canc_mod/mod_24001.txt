Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 75 year old female with history of HTN, HL, CAD s/p MI, and chronic afib on warfarin presented with lightheadedness and nausea found to have complete heart block on EKG.
# symptomatic bradycardia:  The patient presented with symptomatic bradycardia in atrial fibrillation, and was found to have a heart rates in the 30-40s.
The patient was ruled out for MI with negative cardiac enzymes.
Her bradycardia could be secondary to worsening conduction delays due to aging.
The patient had pacer pads placed; she also had one episode of hypotension, which responded to a 500cc NS bolus.
# atrial fibrillation:  The patient has been in slow atrial fibrillation while in the CCU.
# CAD: The patient has a history of MI in [**2123**] with RCA stent.
She was ruled out for MI as the cause of her symptomatic bradycardia.
The patient's beta blocker was also held because of her bradycardia.
# PUMP:  The patient appeared euvolemic on exam, and does not have any history of heart failure.
