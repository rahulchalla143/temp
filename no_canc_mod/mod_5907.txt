Admission Date: [**2109-5-7**]        Discharge Date: [**2109-5-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2038-2-23**]        Sex:  F  Service:  NSU   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and breast cancer who was transferred from [**Hospital1 69**] at [**Location (un) 620**] with a diagnosis of bilateral subdural hematomas after fall.
She came into the house, but she could not tell him exactly what happened, but there was no loss of consciousness.
She had a CAT scan there which showed bilateral subdural hematomas (left greater than right), and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Room.
Upon arrival she was awake and following commands, but within 1 hour she became increasingly lethargic and developed respiratory distress requiring intubation.
A repeat CT revealed a right subdural that had increased in size, which also showed some transtentorial herniation and brain stem compression.
Postoperative CT showed interval development of pontine and midbrain hemorrhages; consistent with infarct.
The family did ultimately decide to make the patient comfort measures only due to her prognosis and the feeling that this was in keeping with the patient's wishes.
