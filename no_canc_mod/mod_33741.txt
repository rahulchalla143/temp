She recovered from that operation and was doing well until she presented last month with a small bowel obstruction neccesitating extensive adhesiolysis, enterectomy and completion subtotal colectomy with an end ileostomy on [**2201-6-11**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**].
She was not experiencing any fevers, nausea or vomiting, however.

Then around noon of HD 2 on [**7-17**], she developed hypoxemia to the 70's and was triggered.
ECG showed sinus tachycardia, CXR showed some fluid, and ABG showed hypoxemia.
She was intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure and started on Vanco/Zosyn IV.
A bronchoscopy and BAL was performed while she was intubated which showed growth of oropharnygeal flora as well as a right lower lobe opacification and mucous plugging of the right main stem bronchus suggesting post-obstructive pneumonia.
Given no growth of MRSA or hx of such, she was mainatined on a 10day course of IV Zosyn for this aspiration PNA which was completed during her hospitalization.
2) Abdominal Pain Initially admitted to the surgical service with abdominal pain and concern for a partial SBO on imaging.
Her abdominal pain resolved and at discharge she continued to have good ostomy output.
4) FEN/aspiration risk: Pt known to have constant aspiration risk.
A repeat S&S eval showed risk of aspiration for all consistencies.
A discussion regarding the results of her S&S eval was had with her HCP mother who emphasized that she is careful about having her sit upright at all times while eating at home and that she has not had an episode of aspiration at home and rather felt that her aspiration events while hospitalized were in the setting of her acute illness.
A full discussion regarding her risks of aspiration were discussed as well as the option of having a PEG placed for enteral nutrition.
Her mother [**Name (NI) 382**] did not want PEG tube placement at this time, but did state that if she developed aspiration events at home she will consider this in the future.
The speech/swallow team had multiple teaching sessions with the parents to attempt to minimize aspiration.
5) ARF: Developed acute renal failure while hospitalized, felt due to temporary hypoxia and ATN while being intubated along with contrast nephropathy.
Takes Lasix at home but due to her NPO status through much of her stay and anticipated difficulty maintaining hydration at home, lasix has been held.
