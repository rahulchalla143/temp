Her pulmonary symptoms started last [**Month (only) 1096**] with progressive shortness of breath impacting activities of daily living.
The tempo of her symptoms has progressed sgnificantly within the past 2 weeks to significant dyspnea even at rest.
Over the past 24 hrs, she has been unable to take significant POs due to her constant symptoms.
She notes a cough productive of thick- white sputum of a glue-like consistency, unchanged from prior accompanied by significant abdominal/ chest pain caused by coughing.
She denies any associated fevers, sick contacts, recent travel, medication noncompliance or other symptoms.
She is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2168**] in pulmonary, and unfortunately, her symptoms have progressed too rapidly to allow pulmonary biopsy.
Given tenuous respiratory status, she was admitted to MICU for further management.
Past Medical History: - pulmonary fibrosis - seasonal allergies - s/p c-section - s/p breast reduction   Social History: lives at home with husband, previously worked as banking clerk but unable to work since decline in functional status.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Microbiology: blood cx: [**10-14**] NTD urine cx: [**10-14**]: no growth  Brief Hospital Course: 65 yo/f with likely pulmonary fibrosis presenting with progressively worsening dyspnea with high A-a gradient requiring 100% NRB to maintain oxygen saturations in the low 90s%.
CXR on admission with worsening bilateral infiltrates, which was most consistent with acute worsening of likely pulmonary fibrosis.
A superimposed process such as infection, fluid overload, right to left cardiac shunt or PE was also possible.
To treat likely progressive pulmonary fibrosis started on pulse dose steriods with 1gm solumedrol daily.
Also maintained on broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc, cefepime and azithromycin given possibility of superimposed infection in setting chronic immunosuppression.
Given limited data that acute decompensated pulmonary fibrosis may be improved with anticoagulation, patient was started on heparin gtt.
She was initiated on morphine SR to decrease work of breathing and symptoms improved slightly.
Unfortunately, patient's respiratory distress continued and she began to complain of respiratory fatigue.
On [**10-16**], patient became more lethargic and obtunded.
The patient expired from respiratory failure on [**10-17**] at 13:45.
Medications on Admission: methylprednisilone 64mg daily cellcept 500mg [**Hospital1 **] bactrim DS three times weekly atenolol 50mg daily advil 200mg prn albuterol prn   Discharge Medications: N/A  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Respiratory Arrest secondary to likely progression pulmonary fibrosis  Discharge Condition: expired  Discharge Instructions: N/A  Followup Instructions: N/A
