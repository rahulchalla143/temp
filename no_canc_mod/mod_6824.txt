He had a Billroth II procedure in [**7-26**], and presented to outside hospital ([**Hospital3 **]) with abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting and [**11-13**] EGD demonstrating esophagitis and gastritis.
On [**11-20**], he was taken to the OR for a conversion of his Billroth II to a roux-en-y for bile reflux gastritis.
On [**11-21**], he suffered an episode of shortness of breath with chest pain radiating down his right arm.
This pain was relieved with SL NTG and morphine.
On admission, he had no EKG changes and he was chest pain free.
He subsequently ruled in for NSTEMI by cardiac enzymes.
He was felt to be a poor candidate for catheterization secondary to his complicated coronary anatomy with multiple previous interventions.
Additionally, he was noted on [**11-22**] to have slurred speech and slight left facial droop.
A non-contrast CT was obtained, which demonstrated a hypodense lesion in the right fronto-parietal region with associated edema and slight mass effect; there was no associated hemorrage.

Hypodense in the right frontoparietal region preserves the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]- white matter and is concerning for vasogenic edema since there is a small amount of mass effect associated with it.
There is a small round area within it and it is unclear whether this represents [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter or a mass.
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats and ventricular paced rhythm.
Brief Hospital Course: Right fronto-parietal brain mass - [**11-22**] the patient was noted to develop a left facial droop w/ slurred speech.
CT scan showed a right fronto-parietal brain mass.
Neurosurgery consult was considered but deferred as pt and family desired no further interventions.
He was not anticoagulated due to the large risk for bleed in light of his recent surgery.
Pt had a CXR that showed him to be in mild failure.
He was also maintained on an ACE inhibitor for afterload reduction.
Acute on chronic renal failure - pt went into mild renal failure with a creatinine of 2.1 likely secondary to hypovolemia/aggressive diuresis .
Bandemia - pt was initially found to have a bandemia with a normal wbc count on admission.
His UA was significant for pyuria and the patient was started on ciprofloxacin.
The patient was given prescriptions for symptomatic treatment of his condition and all other extraneous medications were discontinued.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for ANXIETY.
