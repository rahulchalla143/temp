Past Medical History: asthma with 3 intubations at [**Hospital1 2436**], last [**7-26**] DVT [**12-25**] pulmonary embolism [**12-25**] s/p 3m coumadin ?COPD: dxed at [**Hospital1 2025**] GERD Pneumonia in [**2156**] Syncope and bradycardia s/p PM in [**2156**] Headaches: migraines Anxiety Colitis: Inflammatory Bowel Dz, unknown type, not sure how it was diagnosed   Social History:  Tobacco:  none - Alcohol:  none - Illicits:  none - works as a PA at a rehab   Family History: paternal grandfather MI at 40 Asthma on father's side   Physical Exam: Admission Physical General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: CNII-XII intact, 5/5 strength upper/lower extremities, grossly normal sensation, 2+ reflexes bilaterally, gait deferred, finger-to-nose intact .
HEENT: MMM CV: RRR, no m/r/g Lungs: When patient still groggy asleep, clear but slightly reduced breath sounds.
When patient asked to take a deep breath, Absent breath sounds.
There is no pneumothorax, focal consolidation, or pleural effusion.
No pulmonary embolus detected to the subsegmental levels.
No dissection.
No consolidations or pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: 32F h/o asthma and intubations consistent with severe asthma exacerbation.
Was also treated with Azithromycin for 5 days for presumed bacterial Bronchitis based on purulent sputum.
She was noted have atypical respiratory exam with nearly absent breath sounds, but appeared in no respiratory distress.
Patient was suspected of breath holding and this was confirmed by placing stethoscope on chest for prolonged periods, patient would cough and in the process large volume air movement could be appreciated X 1 then no breath sounds again for 30 seconds to one minute.
On day of discharge patient was cooperative with exam, she had good airmovement with clear breath sounds, no wheezes.
Patient described pleuritic chest pain which was found not to be cardiac in origin or related to PE as negative CTA.
She continued to report intermittent chest tightness which resolved by day of discharge.
UNRESPONSIVENESS Her hospitalization was notable for three episodes of sudden unresponsiveness with chest discomfort/tightness prior to all.
Pt denies any history of episodes like these previously, says they are different from prior syncopal drop attacks she has had previously.
Subsequent episode in ICU was observed, possibly thought to be secondary to low cardiac output in vagal state, and initiation of CLS feature as described below.
She was tachycardic and hemodynamically stable, no air movement noted on exam, no drop in O2 sats throughout the episodes.
Episodes resolve suddenly with no postdrome.
Began suddenly after episode of "chest tightness", patient was unresponsive to sternal rub and multiple ABG attempts.
Patient had slight resistance to eye opening, eyes were roaming, at one point eyes made contact but patient did not respond to voice or commands.
Episode resolved suddenly in [**11-29**] minutes with no postictal state, no self urination or tongue biting.
Patient was at baseline mental status, alert and oriented immediately after the event reporting nausea and dry heaving.
There was no emesis.
Neurology was consulted who found her episode to be highly unsuggestive of a seizure episode or related to patient reported history of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome.
Possibility of vasovagal syncope related to migraine headaches was raised, though this would require no further intervention.
There is also concern for non-organic causes of her symptoms.
Patient, herself, demonstrated less concern for her unresponsive episodes than her asthma symptoms.
She was previously seen at [**Hospital1 2025**], but decided to change neurologists when somatisization was raised as a cause of her symtpoms.
TACHYCARDIA Also during her hospitalization, patient had intermittent tachycardia as high as 140-160s.
Patient had one unusual episode thought to be vagal episode during which patient was noted to be unresponsive and tachycardiac.
Despite this she continued to have intermittent tachycardia which continued through subsequent episodes of unresponiveness as well as when she was in her baseline state.
The summary of the EP report is as follows "Summary (normal / abnormal device function): Stable lead parameters, without evidence of over/undersensing or inappropriately tracking.
Her CLS function appears to be activating during rest in the absence of vagal episodes, prompting atrial pacing to 130 bpm while in bed.
To avoid confusion and inappropriate pacing during this hospitalization, this feature was turned off (programmed to DDD).
She notes that she has also had an episode since implantation where she was not adequately treated by the device and lost consciousness, indicating that the device needed to be optimized prior to this encounter."
Outpatient cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of [**Hospital1 2025**] was notified and felt her symptoms seemed unlikely to be cardiogenic, no intervention needs to be made to CLS function.
5. naproxen 375 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for headache.
9. albuterol sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
10. butalbital-acetaminophen-caff 50-325-40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for headache.
Progestin only OCP  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: asthma exacerbation unresponsiveness   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted for an asthma exacerbation which was managed with high dose steroids and antibiotics and you completd a five day course.
You did require intubation and your symptoms improved during your hospitalization.
During your hospitalization you also had several episodes of unresponsiveness of unclear etiology.
But it was felt that you were not having a seizure or stroke.
Neurology team evaluated you and recommended getting records of prior EEGs and if symptoms continue outpatient EEG may be warranted.
