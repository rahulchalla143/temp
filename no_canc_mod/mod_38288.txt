It was thought that this may have been a pseudocyst versus abscess and it was aspirated on [**2196-2-14**], returning fluid with a high amylase.
Initially he improved but then again became further distended, and had signs and symptoms consistent with sepsis.
A repeat CT scan showed evidence of cholecystitis.
Patient was also noted to have bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and collapse consistent with pneumonia.
Another CT scan was performed which showed a large fluid collection in the peri-hepatic area.
He has been on Levophed for hypotension, and weaning as tolerated.

Separate subhepatic fluid collection does seem to be continuous with the peri-hepatic ascites, drain has pulled out into the subQ tissues.
- [**2-27**] CT Abd: Decreased size of hepatic fluid collection inferior to the left lobe, status post pigtail drain placement.
No significant change in thick-walled irregular fluid collection adjacent to the pancreatic head, most compatible with a pseudocyst.
The gallbladder is not distended, and there is no wall thickening or pericholecystic inflammation.
Moderate simple intra-abdominal ascites.
Persistent left hydronephrosis with delayed contrast excretion.
Abnormal appearance of the Hartmann's pouch is noted, with marked circumferential wall thickening which abruptly transitions to more normal appearing wall.
While this appearance may represent changes of pouchitis, circumferential neoplasm should also be considered, and proctoscopy recommended if not recently performed elsewhere.
- [**3-5**] CT torso: small pleural effusion, compressive atelectasis, subhepatic collection decreased in size 13.7 x 1.7 cm, plastic biliary stent in plastic, liver unremarkable, no transhepatic/extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, spleen normal, adrenals normal, bilateral distal ureteral stones, 6.6 x 5.4 cm simple fluid which partially replaces pancreatic head -> stable, stable [**Doctor Last Name 3379**] pouch wall thickening, no new acute intra-abdominal processes, decreased subhepatic fluid collection, cholecystostomy tube in good position - [**3-7**] Echo: Normal left ventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional systolic function.
Mild right ventricular cavity enlargement with borderline normal free wall motion.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-2-24**], the right ventricular cavity is now mildly dilated with low normal systolic function and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher.
- [**3-8**] Cholangiogram: flow of contrast around but not through CBD stent, contrast flows into the duodenum - [**3-8**] CXR: Opacification at the left base is consistent with atelectasis and effusion, pulmonary congestion - [**3-9**] Triple Phase CT: No new acute intra-abdominal process identified, with relatively stable appearance since examination from [**2196-3-5**].
Slightly decreased size of subhepatic fluid collection inferior to the left lobe with pigtail drain well positioned within the collection, no measuring 55 x 15mm, previously 59 x 19mm.
Cholecystostomy tube in standard position within a relatively [**Name2 (NI) **] gallbladder with no pericholecystic inflammatory change.
contrast within gallbladder likely secondary to cholangiogram.
Thick-walled irregular fluid collection adjacent to the pancreatic head and uncinate process most compatible with pseudocyst measuring 72 x 62 mm, previously 73 x 70mm.
An additional likely either irregular forming pseudocyst or area of inflammatory change seen superior to the pancreatic body 28 x 19 mm, prev 53 x 26mm.
No areas of hypoenhancement noted within the pancreatic parenchyma to suggest necrosis.
Stable extent of moderate simple intra-abdominal ascites.
Bilateral pleural effusions, mildly increased compared to [**3-5**], [**2195**].
On review of the patients records and imaging, he was determined to have multiple fluid collections including a subhepatic fluid collection, a pancreatic fluid collection and free fluid in his abdomen.
At the time of admission, the patient had a percutaneous cholecystostomy in place, and laboratory analysis of fluid from this drain was c/w biliary output; microbiology showed pan sensitive enterococcus in this fluid.
A second drain was in the epigastrium draining fluid c/w pancreatic fluid and was contained in the subhepatic collection.
A needle aspirate was taken from his free peritoneal fluid using ultrasound and this demonstrated fluid c/w pancreatic drainage.
Additionally the patient was found, per record, to have pseudomonas in his urine as well as in sputum cultures, which was confirmed with Bronchoscopy/BAL.
On [**2-25**] patient had persistent Levophed requirement.
An MRCP was performed without any evidence of biliary dilation.
A stent was placed in the distal bile duct due to stenosis.
On [**2196-3-5**] he was transferred back to the TSICU for respiratory distress, febrile to 102.5, tachypneic to 40-45, sinus tachycardia to 130.
A CT abdomen/pelvis showed no interval change.
He was reintubated, was adequately resuscitated with LR and albumin and a diagnostic/ therapeutic paracentesis was performed with 3L drained, pan-cultured, peritoneal fluid cultures finally grew pseudomonas.
On [**2196-3-9**] blood cultures were positive for GNRs.
Discussed with ID - changed dapto to linezolid because of poor urine penetration.
Borderline blood pressures throughout day with intermittent marginal urine output requiring Albumin boluses, patient was made DNR by family but OK to intubate.
On [**2196-3-13**] patient was started on standing lactulose for worsening mental status.
Increasing ascites tapped again for 2.5L.
On [**2196-3-14**] patient had worsening respiratory status.
