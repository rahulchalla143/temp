LEFT ATRIUM: Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the LA.
No mass/thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Mild global LV hypokinesis.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
Focal calcifications in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Conclusions PRE BYPASS Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %).
The right ventricle displays mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
POST BYPASS There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of about 35-40%.
The mitral valve is s/p repair - a mitral valve annuloplasty ring is seen in situ.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.
