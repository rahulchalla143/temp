His initial symptoms were fever and myalgia, beginning abruptly on Friday morning.
On the morning of his admission, he developed palpitations and presented to a hospital in [**Location 3615**], where he was found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation.
From there, he was transported to [**Location (un) 9101**], where he was treated with normal saline, vancomycin 1 gm, azithromycin 500 mg, ceftriaxone 1 gram, digoxin 0.25 mg, ibuprofen 600 mg, acetaminophen 975 mg, diltiazem 20 mg IV, and Cardizen CD 120 mg. His heart rate was controlled, but he developed a new oxygen requirement and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
At [**Hospital1 18**], CXR showed a right-sided pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion.
- No family history of venous thrombosis.

Left base retrocardiac opacity could be due to atelectasis although a second location of consolidation/infection not excluded.
Additionally, subtle opacity at the lateral left mid lung, while could relate to overlying soft tissue, additional focus of consolidation is not excluded.
[**7-7**]: CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the pre-existing right pleural effusion is stable.
There is a newly occurred small reactive left-sided pleural effusion with subsequent left atelectasis.
The diameter of the pulmonary vessels is minimally increased, potentially reflecting mild fluid overload.
Small bilateral simple layering pleural effusions.

ACUTE DIAGNOSES: # Multilobar Pneumonia, likely bacterial: CTA results showed significant tri-lobar PNA which appeared significant enough for shunting to explain his degree of hypoxia.
On the floor he quickly weaned down to room air and was breathing comfortably with occasionally sputum tinged with blood.
#Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: Dr. [**Known lastname 23**] initially presented in new onset A.Fib with runs of RVR into 160s with associated hypotension.
Although he has a history of palpitations in the past (and has been on a Holter monitor), this is his first episode of atrial fibrillation.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: None.
He was told to discuss reinitation of aspirin with his PCP when his hemoptysis ceases.
He should also be screened for hypertension, as it was noted that his blood pressure was elevated to the 140s-150s systolic while he was on the floor.
Disp:*500 ML(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: - Multifocal pneumonia - Sepsis  SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: - Atrial fibrillation with rapid  ventricular response   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were initially admitted to the MICU on a diltiazem drip to control your rapid atrial fibrillation.
You had an ongoing oxygen requirement and it was discovered that you had a multifocal pneumonia.
MEDICATION CHANGES: - Medications ADDED: Linezolid 600 mg Q12H for 10 days - Medications ADDED: Guaifenesin-CODEINE cough syrup as needed for cough - Medications STOPPED: Aspirin - Medications CHANGED: None.
