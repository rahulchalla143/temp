Admission Date:  [**2127-1-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2127-1-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2054-2-18**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**] Chief Complaint: intracranial hemorrhage  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: right hemicraniotomy open aneurysm clipping   History of Present Illness: 73yo F w/ severe headache for the past three days associated with nausea and vomiting.
Interval expansion of right temporal hematoma with mass effect and midline shift of 7 mm towards the left.
Extensive subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage is seen.
Large 2 cm x 1.2 cm right MCA bifurcation aneurysm centered at the site of the temporal hematoma and likely represents the source of bleed.
Poor opacification of the supraclinoid ICA and MCA on the right side with poorly vascularized right cerebral hemisphere, likely secondary to mass effect from the hematoma.
Status post right fronto-temporo-parietal craniotomy with evacuation of a right frontotemporal intraparenchymal hematoma with some persistent foci if intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Widespread subarachnoid hemorrhage is not significantly changed in quantity or distribution.
Additionally, hemorrhage within the third ventricle, fourth ventricle, and foramen magnum and upper cervical spinal canal is not significantly changed.
New small quantity of hemorrhage overlying the tentorium cerebelli leaflets.
Unchanged leftward shift of normally midline structures, although compression of the right lateral ventricle is slightly decreased.
CT Head [**1-16**] AM: worsening rightsided edema and leftward shift  CT Head [**1-16**] Right lower extremity Doppler ultrasound: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right leg  CT Head [**1-16**] Postop: Extension of craniectomy seen with right middle cerebral artery infarct.
The mass effect is stable or slightly decreased.
There remains slight dilatation of the left lateral ventricle.
Extensive infarcts are identified involving the right cerebral hemisphere involving basal ganglia and predominantly the middle cerebral region but also extending to the right occipital lobe.
Additional infarcts in the left cerebral hemisphere are seen in the anterior cerebral artery region as well as in the partial left middle cerebral artery region.
Mass effect on the right lateral ventricle is seen.
Enhancement along the leptomeninges likely related to subarachnoid hemorrhage.
A large aneurysm of the right MCA with rebleeding and midline shift was visualized.
A right hemicraniectomy was performed with evacuation of clot and clipping of the MCA aneurysm.
A post-operative cerebral angiogram showed no sign of vasospasm of other aneurysm but showed no distal flow.
[**1-14**] Pt had repeat CT head that showed decrease in midline shift and evolving R MCA infarct.
[**1-15**]: Repeat CT head showed increased swelling and worsening of R MCA infarct.
Pupils were aniscoric but minimally reactive.
Repeat Head CT demonstrated worsening cerebral edema and increased leftward shift.
Given her clinical deterioration and worsening Head CT the decision was made to extend the craniectomy site to allow for more expansion.
She was taken to the OR for a right temporal lobectomy and extension of the craniectomy site.
Postop Head CT demonstrated minimally improved midline shift.
[**Date range (1) 25556**]: No significant improvements were noted in the the patient's exam, a new finding of a forced downward gaze and occular bobbing led to an MRI which showed bihemespheric strokes.
On the right both the MCA and the ACA showed strokes, and on the Left a new ACA stroke, given the patients new strokes we started to back off on fluids to keep the total fluid balance even to negative.
