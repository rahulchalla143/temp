Per family and records, patient complained of intermittent chest pain, cough, and URI symptoms x 3 days.
Yesterday after getting home from work, he had worsening chest pressure and went to bed early.
He was found unresponsive with agonal respirations.
When EMS arrived approx 30min later, patient was found to be in slow VT/ vfib arrest with "fixed and dilated pupils."
Med-flight also placed c-collar given report of trauma prior to episode of unresponsiveness.
Upon transfer to CCU, patient intubated, hypothermic and sedate.
Pupils minimally responsive with absent corneal reflex and suppressed DTRs.
Unable to obtain a rewiew of symptoms as the patient is intubated.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: + Diabetes, + Hypertension  Social History: immigrant from [**Country 149**] approx 10 yrs ago.

Sinus rhythm.
There are Q waves with ST segment elevation in the inferior leads and the anterolateral leads consistent with acute or evolving infarction.
Reciprocal depressions in the lateral leads offer additional evidence of ischemia.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) with inferior/inferolateral/inferoseptal akinesis and moderate to severe hypokinesis elsewhere.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
ECHO [**2104-3-27**]: There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and posterior akinesis.
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: No left ventricular pseudoaneurysm or free wall rupture seen.
Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w inferoposterior myocardial infarction.
Very small pericardial effusion.
CT Head [**2104-3-29**]: No acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or large acute territorial infarction.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Moderate degenerative changes at C5/C6 with posterior disc osteophyte complex.
Left upper lobe opacity might represent pneumonia.
EEG [**2104-3-26**]: This is an abnormal video EEG due to the presence of a slow background which was generally in the delta and theta frequency range representing a moderate to severe diffuse encephalopathy.
There were very brief periods of alpha frequency background.
It is also  abnormal due to the presence of bifrontal delta and theta frequency slowing seen representing bifrontal subcortical dysfunction.
Overall, there was higher amplitude anteriorly which may indicate bilateral posterior cerebral dysfunction.
There were no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures.
EEG: [**2104-3-30**]: This is an abnormal video EEG due to the presence of a slow background which represents a moderate encephalopathy.
It is also abnormal due to the presence of generalized delta frequency slowing which represents a diffuse subcortical dysfunction.
There were no epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures.
There is a small oval-shaped 1.4 x 0.6 cm T2 hyperintense, FLAIR hypointense cystic structure abutting the right aspect of the superior sagittal sinus at the vertex, which does not demonstrate restricted diffusion, consistent with small arachnoid cyst.
There is no evidence of infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, mass (with the exception of the above-mentioned small arachnoid cyst), mass effect, or shift of midline structures.
There is moderate mucosal thickening of the sphenoid sinuses, left greater than right and mucosal thickening versus fluid within the mastoid air cells, right greater than left.
No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality is demonstrated.
No evidence of infarction identified.
Paranasal and mastoid sinus disease described above.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 39 y/oM with PMH of HTN, [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH s/p inferior- lateral STEMI and V fib arrest admitted in cardiogenic shock requiring multiple pressors and intra-aortic balloon pump, who was on the artic sun protocol, extubated on [**2104-3-31**] and was discharged to rehab.
# S/P Cardiac arrest: Patient experienced V. Fib cardiac arrest at home in the setting of inferio-lateral STEMI.
On admission, he was hypotensive [**2-13**] RV infarct requiring multiple pressors (initially dopamine, neosynephrine and then dobutamine) and intra-aortic balloon pump.
His initial echo showed severe global hypokinesis with an EF of 25%.
His echo on HD 3 showed EF improved to 40% and no mechanical complications.
Per cardiac cath report, patient has no- minimal disease in other coronary arteries.
He was also started on ACE inhibitor and beta blocker after resolution of cardiogenic shock.
He was monitored on telemetry and remained in sinus rhythm with occasional PVCs.
His initial echo showed EF 25% with global hypokinesis and his repeat echo was much improved with EF of 40% and improved ventricular function.
There are some dystonic movements noted with intentional movements that are impairing ambulation and acitivty in small measures.
MRI brain revealed no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality and no evidence of infarction identified.
# Pneumonia: Patient had 3 days of URI symptoms prior to admission.
On HD3, he had increased secretions and fever.
He continued to spike fevers and his ceftriaxone was changed to zosyn.
STEMI was the most likely etiology factor but there was also come concern about lower extremity ischemia from balloon pump or mesenteric ischemia (esp with guiac + stool).
His lactate improved with improved blood pressures and several amps of HCO3 and he had no other signs of leg ischemia or mesenteric ischemia.
# Leukocytosis: WBC was 22 on admission likely stress response from STEMI and cardiogenic shock.
Initially there was no evidence of infection although he did develop a pneumonia.
Occasional low grade temps with no obvious source.
# Type II DM: Patient was admitted with hyperglycemia to 400s in the setting of MI.
He was started on an insulin drip and his fingerstick blood glucose levels dropped appropriately.
# Tranaminitis: Was likely [**2-13**] shock liver and muscle injury from STEMI and CPR.
