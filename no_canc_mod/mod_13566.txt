He also had left rib fracture, left humeral shaft fracture and a left subarachnoid hemorrhage and left open radioulnar fracture, and left subclavian line was placed at the outside hospital.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for left knee scope and left thumb amputation in the past.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The patient has profound bleeding from all surfaces, however, trachea appeared to be midline.
The pupils were 3 mm and sluggishly reactive.
The abdomen was soft and nondistended at first.
Right upper extremity, he had elbow radial pulse and right lower extremity with no obvious injury and palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial on the right lower extremity.
His left upper extremity has shoulder bruises and open forearm fractures, but he has palpable radial pulse.
His left lower extremity has a bruise over his left knee and broken deformity and dopplerable pulses on the left side.
The patient was taken to the computerized tomography unit to obtain computerized tomography scan of the head which showed right frontal contusion, left subdural hemorrhage and left orbital fracture and fourth rib fracture, right axillary sinus fracture, basilar skull fracture and petrous bone fracture.
Computerized tomography scan of the chest showed a left clavicular hair fracture and lateral lung contusion, rib fractures and the patient also had a humeral head fracture.
Left lower extremity, the patient had a tibia-fibula fracture and tibial plateau fracture and knee effusion.
Left upper extremity, the patient had a humerus fracture and open radial and ulnar fracture.
Neurosurgery was consulted, and ICP monitor was placed by Neurosurgery for monitoring his intracranial pressure and the patient was given intravenous antibiotics for his open fracture and Vascular Surgery and Orthopedic Surgery were also consulted.
No intervention was done by Vascular Surgery.
Orthopedic after seeing the patient decided to take the patient to the Operating Room for incision and drainage and open reduction and internal fixation of his left ulnar fracture.
The patient was taken by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] to the Operating Room on [**2200-11-8**] and underwent the incision and drainage and open reduction and internal fixation of his left forearm fractures.
Vancomycin was for his open skull fracture and Ceptaz was perioperatively for his facial fractures.
Oromaxillofacial Surgery was consulted for his facial fractures, which they saw the patient for and recommended no operative repair and recommended Clindamycin for ten days for his maxillary facial fracture.
The patient had a repeat head computerized tomography scan for Neurosurgery to assess this intracranial hemorrhage which appeared with no change.
The patient also underwent subsequent head computerized tomography scan again on [**11-11**] which showed no change in his intracranial hemorrhage.
Due to the patient's multiple lower extremity traumas and injuries and due to the patient's heparin bleed the patient is not able to receive Lovenox for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and an inferior vena cava filter was then placed.
It was retrievable inferior vena cava filter which was placed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 22063**] from Vascular Surgery on [**2200-11-11**].
On [**11-13**], the patient underwent another head computerized tomography scan which showed no change in terms of his intracranial bleed or hemorrhage and ICP drain was then subsequently discontinued by Neurosurgery.
However, it was reported over the next several days the patient remained tenuous in terms of respiratory condition and he has a lot of secretions that require frequent suctioning and the patient's mental status deteriorated.
The repeat head computerized tomography scan shows no change from previous intracranial bleed.
On [**2200-11-18**], the patient had finished a ten day course of Vancomycin and a ten day course of Clindamycin for neurosurgery and oromaxillofacial fractures and the patient's antibiotics were discontinued, and on [**2200-11-18**], the patient apparently spiked a fever to 101.4.
The patient had a panculture and sputum grew out Acinetobacter and pseudomonas and blood culture at the same time grew out Acinetobacter.
Chest x-ray showed small bilateral pleural effusion, although no frank pneumonia was seen.
The patient has a lot of secretions, requiring frequent suctioning.
On [**2200-11-21**], the patient had a repeat head computerized tomography scan which was negative and still showed the right frontal contusion and subarachnoid hemorrhage was unchanged.
The patient had a feeding tube placed by Interventional Radiology and the patient was started on broadly advanced to O2V of breast pallor at 60 cc/hr.
The neurologist saw the patient and recommended a spinal tap and computerized tomography scan with intravenous contrast to further evaluate to rule out cerebrovascular accident and rule out the meningitis, given the patient's history of open skull fracture.
Computerized tomography scan with intravenous contrast on [**11-26**], shows no embolic or hemorrhagic infarct and his right frontal contusion is about the same as previous.
His left subarachnoid hemorrhage has improved prior to previous, and a lumbar puncture was performed on the patient with approximately 10 white blood cells, however, the lumbar puncture grew out coagulase negative Staphylococcus for which we consulted Infectious Disease.
They agreed that coagulase negative Staphylococcus most likely could be a contaminate of the lumbar puncture and they do not believe the patient's lumbar tap was indicative of a meningitis.
They recommended to continue 14 days of Zosyn and Vancomycin for the complete treatment of his respiratory-associated pneumonia.
The patient's mental status began to gradually improve over the next few days.
Neurobehavior saw the patient once again and believed that the patient most likely had altered behavior pattern and altered mental status due to his frontal contusion and recommended follow up in the clinic.
The patient is to be discharged to rehabilitation whenever there is a bed available.
