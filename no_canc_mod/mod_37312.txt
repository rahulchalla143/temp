Abdominal US with dopplers [**4-13**]: IMPRESSION: 1) Findings again suggestive of congestive hepatopathy (nutmeg liver) with cardiomegaly and marked dilatation of the IVC and hepatic veins as well as probable third spacing within the gallbladder wall.
No vascular thrombosis is present.
2) Unchanged cholelithiasis and probable cholesterol polyps within the gallbladder.
Interval increase in the degree of biliary sludge within the gallbladder lumen.
3) Echogenic atrophic kidneys consistent with known underlying renal disease.
Moderate to large right pleural effusion.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Brief Hospital Course: 55 year-old female with history of Type I DM, sCHF (EF 30%) s/p ICD, ESRD s/p failed transplant and OSA who presented with a couple of weeks of worsening fatigue and nausea and transaminitis on labs s/p episode of hypotension/hypothermia without identified cause whose symptoms resolved.
Active issues: #  Episode of hypotension and hypothermia: The morning after admission, the patient developed an episode of hypotension with SBPs in the 60's and hypothermia with a temperature of 91.
EKG showed only slight T wave changes and cardiac enzymes were negative.
U/S of graft site showed no fluid collection.
CXR after [**Female First Name (un) 576**] showed small R apical PTX.
Abd US did show chronic gallbladder wall thickening and cholelithiasis, however no dilatation of her common bile duct.
Surgery was consulted due to concern that her decompensation could have been from a biliary source, but the surgery team did not feel a cholecystecomty was indicated as there was no evidence of inflammation of the gallbladder on the abdominal US.
#  Weakness/nausea/transaminitis:  Her initial symptoms were nonspecific.
Symptoms improved over her hospital course and her transaminitis trended downward.
Hep C VL was negative.
# Hypertension: In the setting of hypotension her antihypertensive medications were all held.
As she improved, her [**Female First Name (un) **] pressure mediations were slowly added back and she was discharged on her home regimen of metoprolol, nifedipine, isosorbide [**Name (NI) 101507**], and [**Name2 (NI) 101508**].
