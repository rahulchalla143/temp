He was recently discharged from an admission to the CCU for an acute on chronic CHF exacerbation thought to be due to dietary incompliance and underdosing of his home diuretic.
During the admission, Foley placement was traumatic and resulted in persistent hematuria.
The Foley was removed, but hematuria continued prompting replacement of Foley with bladder irrigation.
The catheter was replaced, but was not draining, thought to be due to presence of blood clots and thus the catheter was removed.
He presented to the ED today with a markedly distended bladder with inability to void.
A 3 way Foley was placed by the ED team with poor urine output.
Labs were notable for HCT 23 (baseline high 20's to 30's), acute renal failure (Cr 2.1 baseline Cr 1.5-1.8), hyperkalemia (K 6.5) with a newly widened QRS on ECG.
His abdominal distention is improved.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation (last BM yesterday), or changes in bowel habits.
