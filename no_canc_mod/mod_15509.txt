REASON FOR ADMISSION/HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 75-year-old gentleman with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and coronary artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft times three with a left internal mammary artery at [**Hospital6 **] in [**2128-8-1**]).
This was complicated by a postoperative sternal infection requiring debridement and pectoralis muscle advancements.
He was taken back to the operating room in [**2129-11-1**] where an incision and drainage and removal of the sternal wires was performed along with closure of the wound.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The patient was in no apparent distress on 4 liters of oxygen.
The cervical examination revealed no adenopathy.
Cardiovascular examination revealed irregular heart sounds.
There were no murmurs.
Thoracic examination revealed no lesions on the back or flanks.
He had a midline vertical incision extending from the suprasternal notch down to below the xiphoid.
There was a T portion to the lower wound from reconstructive surgery.
The upper three quarters of his sternum appeared to be free of sinus tracks, infections, or masses.
The abdominal examination revealed the abdomen was obese with no masses.
He had an umbilical hernia which was reducible.
Extremity examination revealed no clubbing or edema.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient is a 75-year-old gentleman with multiple risk factors for sternal breakdown, status post median sternotomy.
The patient had a chronic sternal infection that required radical debridement and omental flap for reconstruction.
The patient was brought into the hospital on [**2130-12-20**] and was taken to the operating room for a combined procedure between Thoracic Surgery and Plastic Surgery and underwent opening of his sternal wound and debridement of some of the remaining sternal bone with removal of all infectious tissue.
It was felt that should the patient not tolerate early extubation he would likely also require a prolonged intubation, the decision was made to proceed to early tracheostomy to facilitate ventilator weaning and pulmonary toilet.
He had no neurologic events during this prolonged hospitalization.
He pain was controlled with a combination of empiric and intravenous pain medications.
RESPIRATORY ISSUES:  As stated, the patient had to have a tracheostomy.
The patient also had a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in his sputum.
He has had a persistent white blood cell count, and this was the presumed source.
CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and continued to be in atrial fibrillation postoperatively.
At times he was in a rapid ventricular response which was controlled with both beta blockers, and at one point an amiodarone bolus plus drip, which seemed to control the rapid ventricular response.
GENITOURINARY ISSUES:  The patient has chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of approximately 2.5.
The patient has had no real acute issues with his kidneys.
He has had no gastrointestinal complications.
Today, he had a video swallow and the patient was cleared for puree solids, thin liquids, and to swallow pills and puree.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  As noted, the patient had methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from his sputum and is currently on vancomycin.
