When he got home he developed a R frontal headache.
When his wife came home she thought he seemed a little disoriented because he couldn't see the chair she was pointing out to him, but it may have been due to neglect.
He was brought to [**Location (un) 620**] ED where a NCHCT at 18h00 showed a large R parietal IPH with edema and mass effect but no midline shift.
Possible LUE numbness reported at OSH, denies this currently.
No dysarthria or aphasia.
ROS: denies any fever, chills, weight loss, neckpain, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, weakness, tingling, numbness, bowel-bladder dysfunction, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria, or bright red blood per rectum, rash, muscle aches, joint pains.
Past Medical History: -porcine AVR [**2114**], at that time found to have arch atherosclerosis but no coronary artery disease -cardiac pacemaker ([**Company 1543**] Adapta), dominantly ventricular-paced, for sick sinus syndrome -ingunial hernia   Social History: Lives with wife, no tobacco, 3 children, 1 son and daughter present today   Family History: No brain tumor, ICH, or vascular malformations   Physical Exam: VITALS: T 99.4 HR 62 paced BP 142/66 RR 18 sO2 100%on 4L nc O2 GEN: NAD HEENT: mmm NECK: no LAD; no carotid bruits; full range neck movements LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally HEART: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, gallops and rubs.
ABDOMEN: normal bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended EXTREMITIES: no clubbing, cyanosis, ecchymosis, or edema  MENTAL STATUS: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal affect.
Attention: mildly inattentive on DOWbw.
Language: fluent; Naming difficulties to low frequency objects; Comprehension intact; no dysarthria, no paraphasic errors.
Dense L hemi-neglect: would not attend to any stimuli presented to his L, did not even note his wife when she was standing to that side, when shown his own L thumb stated it was mine.
Mild L ptosis.
VII: Facial movement symmetrical; no facial droop.
VIII: Decreased auditory acuity bilat.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline, no fasciculations.
No adventitious movements, no tremor, no asterixis.
No pronator drift.
CTA Head ([**10-26**]): IMPRESSION: 1 Stable in appearance 5 x 4 cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage of the right parietal lobe with mass effect and vasogenic edema and midline shift of 1.5 mm that is unchanged from previous examination.
No evidence of arterial venous malformation or an underlying lesion.
However, this hemorrhage may mask an underlying lesion, and repeat imaging is recommended to follow up resolution and to assess for an underlying mass or malformation.
Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute pneumonia.
Intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right parietal lobe that is largely unchanged in size and appearance from previous examination from [**2116-10-26**].
No worsening mass effect.
The differential diagnosis for this lesion includes a hypertensive hemorrhage, underlying lesion or arteriovenous malformation.
Right intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right parietal lobe that is largely unchanged in size and appearance from previous examination from [**2116-10-27**].
No new hemorrhage, no worsening mass effect, and no associated hydrocephalus.
The differential diagnosis for this hemorrhage includes amyloid angiopathy, hypertensive hemorrhage, an underlying lesion, or arteriovenous malformation.
Carotid Ultrasound ([**11-2**]): (prelim) 0% stenosis bilaterally  Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 78 year old man with a history of porcine AVR in [**2114**] on Coumadin (for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation around the time of the procedure) and sick sinus syndrome s/p PPM, who presented to an OSH with difficulty focusing his vision, frontal headache, and disorientation, who was found to have a large 5x4 cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right parietal lobe with surrounding vasogenic edema and local mass effect with slight midline shift and compression of the right lateral ventricle.
Neurosurgery was consulted on admission to [**Hospital1 18**], and recommended keeping INR <1.3 and no neurosurgical intervention.
CTA Head showed stable in appearance 5 x 4 cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage of the right parietal lobe with mass effect and vasogenic edema and midline shift of 1.5 mm that is unchanged from previous examination, no evidence of arterial venous malformation or an underlying lesion.
His CRP was 7.1 on admission, but the patient then started complaining of headache and had tenderness to palpation of his left temporal lobe.
He was determined to have temporal arteritis clinically, and was started on Prednisone 60 daily for the next 3 months.
Carotid ultrasound showed 0% carotid stenosis bilaterally on preliminary report.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Medication Humalog Insulin Sliding Scale   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1108**] Rehab Unit at [**Hospital6 1109**] - [**Location (un) 1110**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right parietal IPH, likely due to amyloid angiopathy Temporal arteritis   Discharge Condition: Left sided neglect, no dysarthria, tender to palpation of right temporal region, extinction to DSS (tactile and visual)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with difficulty focusing vision, frontal headache, and disorientation, and were found to have a large right parietal hemorrhage.
This is most likely due to amyloid angiopathy.
You were started on Prednisone 60 mg daily for the next 3 months, given that you were found to have temporal arteritis on exam.
If you develop weakness or numbness, difficulty speaking or swallowing, decreased vision or blurry vision, or any other symptoms that concern you, call your PCP or return to the ED.
