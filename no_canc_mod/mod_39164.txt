Admission Date:  [**2195-2-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2195-2-20**]   Service: SURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**] Chief Complaint: Back Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PROCEDURE: 1.
Thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR) of     multiple penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers in the     descending thoracic aorta using a Cook Zenith TX2     endovascular graft with Pro-Form proximal tapered     component, reference number [**Serial Number 90146**], lot     number [**Serial Number 90147**].
Thoracic and abdominal aortography.
History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 37393**] is an 87 year old female who developed sudden onset of back pain in her upper back, non-radiating, associated with shortness of breath this morning.
This imaging showed a penetrating ulcer w/ mural hematoma of her descending thoracic aorta.
She denies any chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or melena.
ROS is otherwise negative  Past Medical History: PMH: CAD s/p stents x 3, htn, ^chol, melanoma  PSH: TAH/BSO   Social History: SOCIAL HISTORY: Denies smoking history, reports only occassional alcohol.
Neck: No masses, Trachea midline, Thyroid normal size, non-tender, no masses or nodules.
Nodes: No clavicular/cervical adenopathy, No inguinal adenopathy.
Gastrointestinal: Non distended, No masses, No hepatosplenomegally, No hernia, No AAA.
NO STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS ISOLATED.
[**2195-2-8**]:  CTA: Intramural hematoma is seen within the mid thoracic aorta distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery and extending inferiorly to the level of the aortic hiatus ([**Location (un) 11916**] type B).
There is displacement of aortic calcifications away from the wall anteriorly.
At the superior aspect of the intramural hematoma, foci of extraluminal contrast are seen (4;135) with possible communication with the aortic lumen.
There is moderate stenosis of the celiac origin with post-stenotic dilatation as well as of the SMA origin.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mitral annular calcification and aortic annular calcification is present.
CHEST: There is bibasilar atelectasis, without pleural effusion.
There is no pathologic axillary, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
There is no intraperitoneal free fluid or free air.
There is diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.
BONE WINDOWS: There is retrolisthesis of L5 on S1 and anterolisthesis of L4 on L5, both grade I. Degenerative disease is seen of the lumbar spine.
No concerning lytic or blastic lesions are seen.
IMPRESSION:  Acute aortic syndrome with intramural hematoma extending inferiorly.
Contrast within the superior portion may represent bleeding or hemorrhage of the vasa vasorum, or extension from the aortic lumen into the wall.
More inferiorly, a flap may represent a penetrating atheromatous ulcer versus very early aortic dissection along the spectrum of acute aortic syndrome.
[**2195-2-10**]:  ECHO:  The left atrium is markedly elongated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Severe aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Dilated ascending aorta.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
INDICATION: 87-year-old with intramural hematoma, status post endovascular aortic graft.
There has been interval placement of a thoracic aortic stent starting in the proximal descending aorta and terminating at the juncture of the thoracic and abdominal aorta.
Intramural hematoma involving the descending aorta is stable in appearance with three relatively unchanged focal areas of enhancement, not significantly changed compared to [**2195-2-10**].
At the distal end of the graft, there is a new type B dissection extending from the distal thoracic aorta to the aortic bifurcation.
The true lumen feeds the major abdominal aortic vessels, including the celiac axis, SMA and renal arteries arise.
In the right groin, there is a new bilobed right femoral pseudoaneurysm with a narrow neck.
There is again a small- to-moderate nonhemorrhagic left pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion, with associated atelectasis.
There is a 4-mm right middle lobe nodule (2:45).
There are atherosclerotic coronary artery calcifications and a stent within the LAD.
Small mediastinal lymph nodes measure up to 9 mm in the precarinal nodal station and are likely reactive.
The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically with several unchanged hypoattenuating lesions within the left kidney likely representing cysts.
Small retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.
Calcified mesenteric lymph nodes may represent prior granulomatous disease.
There is no ascites.
CT OF THE PELVIS: There is extensive sigmoid diverticulosis.
No pelvic free fluid or lymphadenopathy.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Mild wedge deformity of the T12 vertebral body is unchanged.
New type B dissection involving the abdominal aorta (starting at the distal aspect of the stent to the bifurcation), without involvement of the abdominal branch vessels.
New right femoral pseudoaneurysm with a narrow neck, which is amenable to percutaneous thrombin treatment.
Immediately superficial to the right common femoral artery and common femoral vein are two hypoechoic collections which measure 1.5 cm and 1.1 cm respectively, without evidence of color flow.
IMPRESSION: Two non-vascular hypoechoic collections immediately superficial to the right common femoral artery and common femoral vein, likely reflective of small hematomas/thrombosed PSA.
No patent pseudoaneurysm identified.

Typical signs and symptoms include:  Sudden severe chest or upper back pain, often described as a tearing, ripping or shearing sensation, that radiates to the neck or down the back Loss of consciousness (fainting) Shortness of breath Weakness or paralysis Stroke Sweating High blood pressure Different pulse rates in each arm When to see a doctor If you have signs or symptoms such as severe chest pain, fainting or sudden onset of shortness of breath, contact your doctor or call for emergency medical assistance.
While experiencing such symptoms doesn't always mean that you have a serious problem, it's best to get checked out quickly.
