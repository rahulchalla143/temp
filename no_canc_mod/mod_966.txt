The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent, consistent with age-related volume loss.
Mucosal retention cysts are noted in the left maxillary and right sphenoid sinuses.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Pancolitis, likely infectious or inflammatory in etiology.
Dilated intra and extrahepatic bile ducts, with abrupt cutoff in the visualization of the distal CBD at the level of the pancreatic head, but no gross pancreatic head mass or intraluminal lesion is visualized.
2.8 cm right ovarian cyst, abnormal in postmenopausal female, and not seen on prior CT from [**2179**].
1.9 cm measuring echogenic lesion in the posterior right lobe of the liver which was not visualized on the CT of [**2191-3-3**].
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
Small amount of free fluid in the anterior perihepatic space.
Knee X-ray ([**2191-3-5**])- Three views of the left knee demonstrate mild medial and lateral compartmental osteoarthritis with chondrocalcinosis.
There is severe osteoarthritis of the patellofemoral compartment with joint space narrowing and large osteophyte formation with subchondral cystic change.
In addition, there is mild periosteal reaction of the medial aspect of the distal femur.
There is a large joint effusion with apparent soft tissue mass within the suprapatellar region.
It is unclear as to whether the periosteal reaction is reactive to the suprapatellar process.
There are multiple intra-articular bodies.
No IV gadolinium administered.
Mild intra- and extra-hepatic bile duct dilatation with the common bile duct measuring up to 8-9 mm.
Abrupt caliber change of the common duct at the level of the ampulla of uncertain significance.
No periampullary or pancreatic mass detected.
However, sensitivity of this examination is limited without contrast.
Clinical correlation with symptoms and LFT values recommended, and an ERCP can be obtained for further evaluation.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and retroperitoneal edema related to pancolitis.
Left renal cysts.
No correlate identified to suspected echogenic lesion of the right hepatic lobe on ultrasound [**2191-3-4**].
Duodenal diverticulum.
EUS ([**2191-3-10**])- No mass seen   Brief Hospital Course: 62yF with HTN, HLD, hypothyroidism, and diverticulosis, who presented with an episode of non-cardiogenic syncope and subsequently was found to have pancolitis on CT.  #) Pancolitis: CT demonstrated bowel wall thickening and mild fat stranding throughout colon with no evidence of obstruction, perforation, or abscess.
Inflammatory etiology less likely, given no evidence of inflammation on colonoscopy one month ago.
It showed CBD dilation of 8-9mm but no discrete pancreatic mass (see below).
Patient's symptoms improved while here.
She was afebrile and tolerating a regular diet.
#) Syncope: Thought to be secondary to vasovagal event (given prodromal symptoms) vs dehydration (given hypotension, poor PO intake prior to admission).
A cardiac etiology was thought unlikely, given normal EKG, no tele events, no murmurs on exam, no signs of LV dysfunction on stress MIBI from [**2181**].
Patient's hypotension was corrected and she remained asymptomatic.
This is concerning for underlying nutritional deficiency and decreased hepatic production  vs protein wasting gastroenteropathy.
Patient has no obvious edema on exam.
Most likely due to poor nutrition in recent weeks.
#) UTI: UA positive for nitrates and WBCs, the latter of which may have been [**2-1**] overwhelming inflammatory process in the gut.
Pt is without dysuria or frequency.
The antibiotics for presumed GI infection would also treat any UTI.
#) Anemia with macrocytosis: HCT down to 28 on ICU Day 1, down from baseline 32 on admission.
This may represent hemo-dilution vs GI bleeding in setting of inflamed gut.
Per chart, pt also has a remote history of iron deficiency anemia.
No signs of blood in diarrhea.
#) Hypothyroidism: Pt carries dx of hypothyrodism but had several signs/sx of hyperthyroidism on admission, including tremor (gone the following morning), proptosis, fine hair, warm skin.
#) Pancreatic mass: Bile duct dilatation seen on CT but LFTs normal.
Concern for mass in head of pancreas.
This is a possible explanation for patient's history of abd pain, though pt has no other signs/sx of systemic illness, including wt loss, appetite loss, etc, and pancreatic CA would not explain patient's pancolitis.
GI was consulted and patient underwent MRCP and EUS, both of which did not show pancreatic mass.
#) HTN: Lisinopril and verapamil initially held in setting of hypotension.
#) Hypomagnesium- Patient had low magnesium while here of unknown etiology.
#)  Rash- Patient developed a rash in her groin while here that was treated with topical miconazole to which she responded well.
She also had a rash on her left buttock that was noticed by nursing on [**3-9**].
#) Knee pain- Patient developed knee pain while here.
Aspirate taken- did not show signs of infection or crystal arthritis.
Pain improved with tylenol (avoided NSAIDs given recent GI symptoms).
By discharge, pain was drastically improved.
Miconazole Nitrate 2 % Powder Sig: One (1) Appl Topical TID (3 times a day) as needed for irritation.
While here, it was found that you had an inflammation of your small bowel.
The gastroenterologist team evaluated you and performed an MRCP followed by an endoscopic ultrasound, which did not show any pancreatic mass.
You experienced some knee pain but it improved on its own.
Please do not take Aleve anymore given your recent GI symptoms.
