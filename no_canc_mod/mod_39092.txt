There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, with mild unfolding and tortuosity of the aorta.
Prominence of the pulmonary arteries with a tapered configuration is consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is identified.
No pneumothorax is detected.
No pulmonary embolism or dissection.
New slight compression deformity of mid-thoracic (probably T6) superior endplate.
Small right and trace left pleural effusions.
Unchanged left ventricular hypertrophy, changes from prior aortic valve replacement, and atherosclerotic calcification.
Again seen is severe hyperinflation, consistent with severe COPD.
The patient is status post sternotomy with moderate cardiomegaly and unfolded aorta, unchanged.
No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is identified.
No pneumothorax is detected.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30%).
Systolic function of apical segments is relatively preserved (suggestive of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is minimal aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with global hypokinesis suggestive of a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Brief Hospital Course: 69F h/o COPD (FEV1 47%), tobacco abuse, DM2, chronic back pain on narcotics, mild dementia initially presented with hypoglycemia after accidental insulin overdose and developed acute SOB while being observed in the ED.
Dyspnea:  Most likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of volume resuscitation from hypoglycemia vs. COPD exacerbation.
No previous history of CHF, but elevated BNP.
CXR appeared clear except for chronic emphysematous changes.
Patient was started on a long prednisone taper, given recent admit for COPD exacerbation, and sudden worsening dyspnea.
Ruled out for MI with 3 negative cardiac enzymes, and monitored on telemetry with no significant events.
ECHO showed EF of 25-30% concerning for nonischemic cardiomyopathy.
Patient did not require lasix in house and was stable over her subsequent course only on therapy for COPD -Consider outpatient stress test once COPD exacerbation has resolved.
Discontinued D5 in the MICU, and no further hypoglycemic episodes.
Diabetic teaching was given to patient and family members.
[**Name (NI) **] will go home with VNA for diabetic assistance, and was discharged with an insulin pen for easier administration.
Albuterol 1 Puff Inhalation Q4H as needed for wheezing.
Fleet Enema once a day as needed for constipation.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for SOB, wheezing.
Hypoglycemia 2.
COPD exacerbation Secondary diagnosis: Type 2 diabetes mellitus Chronic low back pain   Discharge Condition: Stable.
While you were in the emergency room you had some shortness of breath, and got steroids for this.
If you have worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, feel lightheaded, or your sugars are poorly controlled, please see your primary doctor or go to the emergency room.
