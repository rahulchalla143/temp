Admission Date:  [**2110-2-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2110-2-24**]  Date of Birth:   [**2038-10-25**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Presenting for right heart catheterization and Swan-Ganz placement for inotrope therapy.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71 year old male with congestive heart failure, secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 15% with the following baseline:  No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no palpitations, no nausea, vomiting, no diaphoresis.
He denies orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea as well as ankle edema.
Over the past one month, the patient has been feeling dizzy and has been having episodes of near syncope as well as syncope.
He has been generally feeling much weaker, though still without shortness of breath, chest pain, edema or orthopnea.
The patient also reports that he has had two urinary tract infections in the past one month with frequency nocturia.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of less than 15%.
The patient sustained two myocardial infarctions since the late [**2087**]'s and sustained a torsades ventricular fibrillation arrest.
He has had some hypoxic brain injury from this.
Status post Degenerative disc disease pacemaker and AICD placement.
Mild left monocular blindness.
Likely benign prostatic hypertrophy with two urinary tract infections in the past one month.
ALLERGIES: Aldactone causes hyperkalemia and acute renal failure.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2109-11-1**] shows left circumflex occluded after the first obtuse marginal one which was patent.
Left anterior descending and right coronary artery with mild luminal irregularities, mean right atrial pressure of 12, right ventricular end diastolic pressure of 22, pulmonary artery pressure 54/30; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 28; cardiac index 1.7.
Echocardiogram on [**2109-5-6**] shows left ventricle severely dilated, severe left ventricular global hypokinesis, ejection fraction less than 15%.
Left atrium mildly dilated.
Right ventricle mildly dilated.
Global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
General:  Very thin, chronically ill appearing male, in no acute distress, but looks very weak.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no rubs or gallops.
There is a systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.
No jugular venous distention.
No peripheral edema.
No sensory or motor deficits.
HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  No icterus, no pallor.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] first underwent a non invasive physiologic study, NIPS, which showed his devices to be functional; however, this study did show possible occlusion of the superior vena cava and subclavian venous vasculature.
Follow-up ultrasounds of bilateral upper extremities revealed that the bilateral internal jugular, subclavian and axillary veins were patent but there was sluggish flow on the left side.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was next transferred to the CCU where a Swan-Ganz catheter was inserted under fluoroscopy through a femoral vein because of inability to pass it through the internal jugular vein.
After two days of Dobutamine therapy, the patient was transferred back to C-Medicine where the Dobutamine drip was continued on the floor for several days, again with no clinical improvement.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was next taken for an attempt at biventricular pacer upgrade but because of an occluded superior vena cava, the leads were unable to be inserted.
It should be noted that the patient was maintained on heparin since he was off his Coumadin, in order to maintain anticoagulation for his known superior vena cava thrombus.
His chest tube was removed by the cardiothoracic surgery service with a residual small pneumothorax in the apex of the left lung.
At no time did he become symptomatic from low blood pressure.
Near the end of his hospital course, the Carvedilol was discontinued and the patient was kept on Lisinopril, given his persistent low blood pressure and the fact that he will not be able to monitor his blood pressure at home while taking his medications.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] also had low urinary output near the end of his hospitalization which increased somewhat with the insertion of a Foley catheter.
Given this and the patient's history of frequent urinary tract infections over the past one month, he almost certainly has benign prostatic hypertrophy and this should be followed up as an outpatient.
Follow-up x-ray prior to discharge of the patient's left apical pneumothorax revealed no change.
At no time did the patient become acutely dyspneic nor show any evidence that he was in congestive heart failure nor that his pneumothorax became symptomatic.
This was held his entire hospitalization and he did not develop pulmonary edema.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of less than 15%.
Congestive heart failure, secondary to #1.
