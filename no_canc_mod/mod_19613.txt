Admission Date: [**2177-8-16**]        Discharge Date: [**2177-8-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2097-3-17**]        Sex:  M  Service: Cardiac Surgery   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old man with a long history of coronary artery disease who for the past several weeks has experienced increasing chest pain which in retrospect was  angina and has taken increased nitroglycerine.
The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, and shortness of breath.
He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit, however review of the EKG showed severe EKG changes.
He was taken for emergent catheterization that showed 90% left main, 90% ostial LAD stenosis, circumflex disease and moderate right coronary artery disease.
The patient was hypotensive and hemodynamically unstable.
Surgery was consulted because the patient developed cardiogenic shock acidosis and hypotension and intraaortic balloon pump was placed which stabilized his hemodynamics although he continued to be somewhat hypotensive and acidotic.
On physical examination, his BP was 90/50 on the intraaortic ballon pump with elevated filling pressures, HR was 90 BPM.
Lung exam showed bilateral rales.
Abdomen was soft and nontender.
Cardiac exam showed distant heart sounds.
The patient had non-papable distal extremity pulses, suggesting peripheral vascular disease.
Ejection fraction initially was 20-30% with pulmonary hypertension and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
His mixed venous oxygen saturation was approximately 48%, suggesting poor peripheral perfusion and shock.
He has rather severe pulmonary hypertension prior to surgery (55/27 mmHg).
He developed severe episode of ventricular tachycardia prior to chest closure.
His poor hemodynamic condition was felt most likely to be due to poor underlying cardiac function, poor bypass targets and poor vein conduit.
His acidosis may be in part been due to the IABP and peripheral vascular disease.
He continues to have low cardiac output syndrome and acidosis despite maximal inotropic support and intraaortic balloon pump support.
Acute myocardial infarction.
Cardiogenic shock, treated with IABP and emergency CABG x 3.
Congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema.
Mild renal insufficiency, peripheral vascular disease.
Moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
