Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed severe left main and two vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA was calcified with a distal 80% lesion leading into the ostial LAD and ostial LCx.
The LAD was calcified with the ostial 80% lesion and mild diffuse disease.
The LCx was calcified with the ostial 80% lesion and an additional 80% stenosis proximally.
The RCA had a high anterior origin and was mildly calcified with mild diffuse plaquing to 25%.
Abdominal aortography demonstrated mild tapering of the distal aorta, a 60% proximal left renal artery stenosis, and mild bilateral common iliac artery plaquing to 30% on the right.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderate systemic arterial hypertension (SBP 174 mm Hg).
The left ventricular filling pressure was moderately elevated (LVEDP 23 mm Hg).
Moderate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Moderate left renal artery stenosis.
ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to distal inferolateral wall hypokinesis.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with normal global systolic function.
Estimated elevated left ventricular filling pressures.
Intra-op Echo [**2134-6-14**] PRE BYPASS No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No significant change from the pre-bypass study.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 year old female with history of diabetese c/b foot ulcers, CHF presents with NSTEMI on POD#1 from skin grafting to right foot ulcers.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD 4, the sternal wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
