Admission Date:  [**2118-5-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2118-5-12**]  Date of Birth:   [**2118-5-6**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Naomie [**Known lastname 48156**] was born at 30 and 5/7 weeks gestation, after induction for intrauterine demise of her twin, secondary to twin to twin transfusion syndrome.
The pregnancy was complicated by twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome and demise of the other twin.
The mother was treated with Betamethasone on [**2118-4-21**] due to abnormalities of fetal testing.
The infant emerged with decreased tone and respiratory response; apgars were six at one minute and six at five minutes.
The infant initially required continuous positive airway pressure by nasopharyngeal delivery due to mild respiratory distress.
On the day of delivery, she was noted to have some episodes of apnea with desaturations.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm and there was no murmur.
She remained euglycemic during her Neonatal Intensive Care Unit stay and had adequate urine output.
She was started on Ampicillin and Gentamycin at the time of admission for sepsis suspected.
The profound apnea present within the first 24 hours of life prompted a CAT scan on day of life number one, [**2118-5-7**], which revealed a large bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage, evolving cystic encephalomalacia in the deep [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter.
Low signals in the white matter, brain stem and cerebellum were noted.
A follow-up Magnetic resonance scan study done on [**2118-5-11**] revealed hemorrhagic periventricular leukomalacia margins, bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage, germinal matrix hemorrhage, hemorrhage of the posterior fossa and subdural hematoma.
The infant was also started on Phenobarbital on day of life number one for desaturations and apnea felt to be associated with seizure activity.
Sepsis ruled out.
Intraventricular hemorrhage.
Cystic encephalomalacia.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage.
