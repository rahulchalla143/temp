**FINAL REPORT [**2169-5-8**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2169-5-8**]):    NO GROWTH.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the distal inferior and distal lateral walls, and apex.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The pulmonary vascular congestion and pleural effusions have substantially decreased.

Brief Hospital Course: 51M with PMH HTN, HLD and NSTEMI and three-vessel [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] requiring ballooning several years later presents with acute onsent chest pain found to have a STEMI now s/p LAD thrombectomy and POBA.
# CAD: Patient with known history of CAD with cardiac risk factors: HTN, HL, strong family history and smoking.
Patient presented after syncopal event and complaints of chest pain.
Asymptomatic hypotension with SBPs in 90s prompted downtitration of Lisinopril 40mg to 20mg QD and Atrial Fibrillation with RVR prompted uptitration of metoprolol from 25mg [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Hospital1 **] to 75mg XL QD.
At time of discharge patient hemodynamically stable and chest pain free.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES: -- Potential cardiac rehab as an outpatient -- Continue smoking cessation counseling .

Telemetry with evidence of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rates (to the 130s) on hospital day 2.
Patient reported associated palpitations during the episode and upon questioning endorsed previous episodes of palpitations as an outpatient; consistent with PAF.
# S/P VT/VF Arrest:  In ED, patient noted to be in VT alternating with VF, requiring cardioversion x 6.
Likely secondary to ischemic tissue from known STEMI.
He was without further episodes of VT or VF.
