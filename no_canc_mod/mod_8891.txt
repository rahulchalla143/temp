Admission Date:  [**2154-8-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-8-23**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1899**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Insertion of Metronic Dual Chamber Adapta L pacemaker   History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **]M with a history of CAD s/p CABG in [**2124**] and recent admissions ([**8-6**]) for inferior STEMI s/p DES in SVG-LAD and CP r/o MI ([**8-17**], d/c'ed [**8-18**]), CHF, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (not on anticoagulation) p/w substernal chest pain, and was found to have A-fib w/ RVR.
Pain was described as midsternal, with radiation to both arms, very similar to the pain he had during prior ischemic events, but gradually worsening to [**11-11**], with no diaphoresis, sob, n/v.
He underwent urgent cardiac cath for revascularization with occluded SVG-RCA.
Cath was complicated by hypotension with IABP insertion.
Repeat angiography of SVG-LAD revealed 95 % stenosis of its ostium and underwent PTCA and one drug-eluting stent.
Pt rated pain [**11-11**] upon arrival.
Pt states pain is 0/10 at this time.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope, claudication.
Other ROS is notable for vision loss (only perceptable to light) on the right side.
Pt also c/o hesitency during urination, which has been a chronic issue.
He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.

No xanthalesma.
NECK: No JVP elevation CARDIAC: irregularly irregular rhythm, good s1, s2 with no murmurs appreciated.

There is moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette which is unchanged.
The aorta is mildly tortuous and diffusely calcified, which is stable.
Multiple calcified mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are again demonstrated.
There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Increasing opacification of the right lung base may represent worsening atelectasis, pulmonary edema, or infection.
Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is redemonstrated suggestive of a small pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Increasing patchy opacity in the right lung base may reflect worsening atelectasis, edema, or infection.
Small right pleural effusion, unchanged.
# Portable CXR [**8-21**] INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with tachybrady syndrome status post dual-chamber pacemaker implant using the axillary vein.
The lungs are well expanded and show mild bilateral interstitial opacities.
No pleural effusions or pneumothorax is present.
IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial edema.
No pneumothorax.
Left lung field is clear without vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.
The right lung shows chronic apical changes with scarring and nodular thickening of the apical pleura and a prominent minor fissure which are unchanged since at least [**2153-10-3**].
Compared with radiograph on [**8-21**] and after accounting for difference in positioning and technique, there is mild worsening of the right lower lobe opacity with obscuring of the right hemidiaphragm.
Blunting of the right pleural sulcus is likely due to tiny pleural effusion or pleural scarring with retraction and has been present since at least [**2153-10-3**].
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Mild interval worsening of right lower lobe opacification.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]M with a history of CAD s/p CABG and multiple stents, CHF, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation p/w substernal chest pain, A-fib w/ RVR, but later developed sinus bradycardia and underwent pacemaker placement.
# A-fib with RVR Patient presented with A-fib with RVR in the setting of recent STEMI s/p restenting of SVG-LAD.
On presentation he was in [**11-11**] chest pain with HR in 110-120s with no evidence of ischemia on EKG, but a slight increase in cardiac enzymes on the second day, consistent with demand ischemia.
A decision of chemical conversion was made after first seen in the ED, given his intolerance to b-blocker and good response to amioderone for SVT during prior admission.
Pt responded well to amiodarone, with complete resolution of chest pain and tachycardia.
However, he later developed mixed sinus / junctional bradycardia in 30-40s with stable blood pressure.
Patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.
We hope with the pacemaker, patient would be able to tolerate optimal medical management for his A-fib to prevent rapid ventricular rate and demand ischemia.
After discussing with family, we decided not to start anti-coagulation, given his age and risk of life-threatening bleeding.
# CAD: Patient had recent STEMI s/p stent placement in SVG-LAD.
His chest pain on presentation was not associated with EKG changes.
There was a transient slight elevation of cardiac enzymes, likely a result of demand ischemia secondary to rapid ventricular rate during A-fib.
We temporarily discontinued lisinopril because of patient's low blood pressure.
- Please consider restarting lisinopril if patient's blood pressure tolerates .
# CHF Patient has a documented history of CHF likely secondary to his long standing CAD, with stable LVEF at 30% and mild to moderate MR on recent ECHO.
Of note, he had a history of refractory pleural effusion requiring talc pleuridesis.
# Right eye vision loss Patient reported vision loss in his right eye for an unknown duration, likely started during his recent hospitalization for STEMI.
He was seen by our ophthalmology team, and was found to have a subretinal hemorrhage, involving the macula.
This unfortunate incident could have potentially happened in the setting of anti-platelet treatment for his cardiac problems.
CHRONIC ISSUES # HTN Patient has a documented history of HTN.
We temporarily discontinued his lisinopril, isosorbid mononitrate and furosemide, and restarted him on isosorbid mononitrate, decreased dose of furosemide, but no lisinopril.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES - please consider restarting lisinopril given patient's history of CAD and CHF.
# Chronic renal insufficiency Patient's Cr was at his recent baseline of 1.8-2.0.
It appeared that his renal insufficiency only started to worsen in the past two years.
His renal insufficiency could certainly be a result of poor forward flow secondary to CHF.
However, patient did endorse symptoms associated with BPH, and was found to have moderate retention despite spontaneous urination.
The post-renal obstruction could be a component causing his renal insufficiency, and potentially be reversible.
OUTPATIENT - please consider evaluation for BPH .
# GERD Patient has a documented history of GERD.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with chest pain and a fast heart rate.
Your chest pain is gone but because you still have blockages in your arteries, you will probably have more chest pain in the future.
Chest pain that lasts only seconds and goes away completely should not be concerning.
Chest pain that lasts more than seconds can be treated with one nitroglycerin tablet every 5 minutes, no more than 2 tablets total.
If you still have chest pain after nitroglycerin tablets or if the chest pain is severe, call 911 or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Your urine has some bacteria in it, you have been started on antibiotics for a 7 day course.
Increase amiodarone to 200 mg daily to prevent atrial fibrillation and a fast heart rate 3.
Start Metoprolol succinate daily to prevent chest pain 4.
Start ciprofloxacin to treat the bacteria in your urine .
No soap over the incision site.
