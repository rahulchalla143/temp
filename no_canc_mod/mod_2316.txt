While visiting her, at 4.15pm he suddenly developed slurred speech.
A CT head was negative for acute pathology.
CTA showed a decreased flow in the L-superior MCA, decreased signal in L-MCA.
No headache or double vision, no nausea or vomiting.
He also has been having some chest, L-shoulder and L-arm discomfort.
ROS: denies any chills, visual changes, hearing changes, headache, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, weakness, tingling, bowel-bladder dysfunction, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria, or bright red blood per rectum.
No chiropracter   Past Medical History: - some kidney problems in the past; says he was said to drink plenty of fluids   Social History: Occupation: does not work; used to do some "taxes", when asked for whom, he said for himself Smoking: no; EthOH: no; drug abuse: some pot Does not drive; lives alone; divorced; 3 children: 24, 22, 6, all live in the area.
ABDOMEN: normal bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended EXTREMITIES: no clubbing, cyanosis, ecchymosis, or edema  MENTAL STATUS: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal affect.
Language: fluent; repetition: intact; Naming intact; Comprehension intact; no dysarthria, no paraphasic errors.
Fund of knowledge normal; 3D-construction: intact; No Apraxia.
VII: Prominent R-facial droop (UMN pattern, but also involving upper part of the face) VIII: Hearing intact to finger rub bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline, no fasciculations.
No adventitious movements, no tremor, no asterixis.
[**Doctor First Name **] slowed on the R.  No dysmetria or pastpointing.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Normal CT angiogram with no evidence of dissection or aneurysm.
No intracranial mass lesion.
----- MRI head: FINDINGS: Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarct.
There is no midline shift, mass effect, hydrocephalus or focal signal abnormalities seen within the brain.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct.
No lateralizing or epileptiform abnormalities were seen.
------ TTE: Conclusions: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
Premature appearance of agitated saline contrast is seen in the left atrium post-Valsalva release c/w a patent foramen ovale.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**2-7**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
On initial exam, he had a Right facial droop, slurred speech, Right homonymous hemianopsia, followed by R-pronator drift and R-leg drift.
Head CT was negative for bleed or early infarct signs.
His facial weakness appeared to be a nuclear or peripheral facial, but he clearly had a field cut, sensory loss, and hemiparesis.
The patient was felt to most likely have a subcortical posterior circulation stroke.
He improved quickly, and by the next day he had no appreciable weakness, sensory loss, slurred speech, or visual field deficit.
He had 2 MRIs performed, neither of which showed any abnormality or evidence of stroke/restricted diffusion.
He then had a TEE which showed a PFO and mild-moderate aortic regurgitation(but normal aortic valve) but no other abnormality(including no atrial septal aneurysm).
Cardiac telemetry while here for several days showed no abnormality.
He also had blood cultures sent to evaluate for possible septic emboli.
There was no valvular lesion seen on TEE either.
Also consider CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis to rule out malignancy as a cause of hypercoagulability.
In addition, he will need to have a contrast brain MRI performed as an outpatient before his follow-up to confirm the absence of any enhancing lesion that may explain his symptoms(especially as seizure is still a remote possibility).
He continued to have a right facial droop, but was otherwise at his baseline.
