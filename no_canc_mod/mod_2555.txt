Admission Date:  [**2162-4-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2162-5-10**]   Service:  ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Severe mitral valve, severe mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis, as well as aortic regurgitation.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old female with a history of rheumatic heart disease status post mitral valve replacement x2, the most recent one being in [**2150**]; it was a porcine valve.
She also has a history of atrial fibrillation with a VVI pacemaker in place, as well as diabetes mellitus, pulmonary hypertension and aortic regurgitation with mild aortic stenosis which was diagnosed in [**2156**] by an echocardiogram.
She presented on [**4-20**] with worsening dyspnea on exertion for five days.
She had no difficulty getting air.
She had no pedal edema, no fevers, no new medications.
She denied any paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
She had a gastrointestinal bleed several months prior to admission and received four units of packed red blood cells.
She did state that she had had recent dark stools.
Rheumatic fever 2.
History of atrial fibrillation 5.
Diabetes mellitus since [**2150**] 7.
Hyperlipidemia 8.
Bilateral cataracts, glaucoma on the left 9.
Questionable left subclavian thrombosis 14.
Coumadin  ALLERGIES:  She had no known drug allergies.
The patient was admitted to the medicine service where it was felt that she had worsening aortic regurgitation, as well as mitral regurgitation leading to these symptoms.
Here she underwent a work up which included an echocardiogram that demonstrated a mildly dilated left atrium with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and an overall left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%.
The aortic valve leaflets were moderately thickened with moderate aortic valve stenosis and mild to moderate 1 to 2+ aortic regurgitation.
A bioprosthetic mitral valve was also seen that demonstrated thickened leaflets with at least modest mitral regurgitation without significant stenosis.
She also underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**4-22**] that was significant for the following:  Normal coronaries in a right dominant system, 3+ mitral regurgitation and moderate to severely stenosed aortic valve with a mean gradient of 30 across the valve, as well as severe primary pulmonary hypertension.
In the meantime, she had a tooth extraction and on [**4-29**], she underwent a mitral valve replacement with porcine valve, as well as an aortic valve replacement with pericardial tissue valve.
However, she failed the extubation and had to be reintubated for respiratory acidosis and respiratory distress.
At this point, she was placed on a regular diet, however she did have some problems with swallowing.
The patient was also given a trial of clear fluids and slowly advanced to a regular diet.
She was clear to auscultation with a sternotomy wound that showed no evidence of drainage or infection.
She is being sent to rehabilitation because of poor balance, high fall risk and difficulty with activities of daily living.
