Head CT scan revealed intraparenchymal hemorrhage; he was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for continued trauma care.
[**Doctor First Name **] s/p MVC and increasing rigidity on exam in all extremities REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: [**Doctor First Name **] pontine lesion, please perform with Gad CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  Reason: [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **]  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 23 year old man s/p MVC c IPH in R basal ganglia and occipital lobe REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN WITH MR ANGIOGRAPHY  HISTORY: Evaluate extent of diffuse axonal injury.
FINDINGS: Previously noted multiple intraparenchymal hemorrhages as well as right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] hemorrhage are redemonstrated, with probable additional tiny amounts of blood within the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Tere are probable additional smaller areas of hemorrhage within the cerebellum and throughout the cerebral hemispheres, as seen on the susceptibility weighted scans.
Also noted is high T2 signal within the right side of the pons and the left side of the splenium of the corpus callosum.
Given the history of major head trauma, these latter lesions presumably represent nonhemorrhagic shear injuries, as well.
There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
There is fairly extensive subgaleal swelling, somewhat more evident on the left side, and most prominent on both sides near the cerebral vertex.
CONCLUSION: More extensive shearing injury, both nonhemorrhagic and hemorrhagic, compared to the recent CT scan, as noted above.
MR ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **] AND ITS TRIBUTARIES  TECHNIQUE: Three-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar reconstructions.
There is no definite evidence for the presence of vascular injury or aneurysm, within the limitations of this modality.
INDICATION: Question [**Doctor First Name **] status post MVC and increasing rigidity on exam in all extremities, evaluate pontine lesion, please perform with gadolinium.
A right frontal subdural collection containing hemorrhagic products which are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on gradient echo sequences, is increased in size from the prior MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**5-25**] and probably stable in size in comparison with the head CT of [**6-3**], [**2128**].
Multiple bilateral foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage, as well as hemorrhage within the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle, appear stable in size.
T2 hyperintensity and small focus of hemorrhage within the splenium, consistent with patient's known diffuse axonal injury, appear unchanged.
Evaluation of the signal abnormality within the right pons, which appears contiguous with signal abnormality involving the right internal capsule, is somewhat limited due to motion artifact, although probably unchanged.
No new areas of intracranial hemorrhage are identified.
There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
No areas of abnormal enhancement are identified within the brain parenchyma following the administration of gadolinium, although evaluation is limited by motion artifact.
There is probable dural enhancement about the right convexity at the site of the subdural collection.
No areas of slowed diffusion are identified to suggest a new acute minor or major vascular territorial infarct.
Right subdural hematoma, increased since [**5-25**] but probably unchanged since [**2129-6-3**].
Unchanged bilateral parenchymal hemorrhages and intraventricular hemorrhage.
Edema within the splenium of the corpus callosum as well as within the right pons and internal capsule, consistent with patient's diffuse axonal injury, are probably unchanged allowing for technical limitations due to marked patient motion.
MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]:  TECHNIQUE: 3D time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar reconstructions.
MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **] AND ITS TRIBUTARIES: The vessels of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] and its major tributaries are patent without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN  Reason: [**Location (un) **] obstruction  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 23 year old man with diffuse axonal injury s/p open G-tube placement, with emesis REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: [**Hospital **] obstruction INDICATION: 70-year-old male with head trauma, NG tube placement.
No dilated loops of small bowel are seen.
IMPRESSION:  No dilated loops of small bowel to suggest SBO.
Neurosurgery was immediately consulted because of his head injury.
He underwent further imaging of his head; MRA did not reveal any vascular injuries; MRI of the head did reveal diffuse axonal injury.
He remained in the ICU for several weeks; he initially had problems with elevated heart rate and blood pressure; both improved with IV Lopressor and Hydralazine.
The ileus did eventually resolve; his tube feedings were restarted; he was started on Reglan and is currently tolerating these with minimal residuals.
Vascular surgery was consulted for placement of IVC filter given his high risk for thromboembolism.
Filter was placed on [**2129-6-15**] without complication.
He was also followed by Neurology during his hospital stay; EEG monitoring was performed and revealed no seizure activity.
