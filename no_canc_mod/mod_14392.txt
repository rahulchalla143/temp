By this time the patient had not been febrile nor exhibited any clinical symptoms of infection.
The wound site had no evidence of erythema although had mild serosanguinous drainage within normal limits.
Because this was a mild elevation, presumably from initiation of quinapril as well as continuation of Lasix, both quinapril, Lasix and potassium were discontinued.
By [**2172-4-23**] the patient's clinical status had dramatically improved and repeat creatinine level revealed a value of 1.6 indicating reversal of the trend.
With the patient's clinical status significantly improved, the follow up on the urine culture revealed that the patient had a low-grade urinary tract infection at that time.
x 5 days for urinary tract infection.
