Admission Date:  [**2139-2-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-2-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2070-7-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Blood transfusions Intravenous immunoglobulin infusion Platelet transfusion   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 68yo F w/ PMH of severe AS, MR, CHF, ITP, type 2 DM, and cryptogenic cirrhosis who was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 37495**]/07 for variceal banding and a resultant pneumonia (s/p 7 day course of levo/flagyl) who presented initially on [**2139-2-10**] s/p an episode of shortness of breath and hypotension following an infusion of Winrho for ITP.
Approximately 45 minutes after the infusion, she developed rigors and became hypotensive to 70/50.
She also became increasingly hypoxic to 87% on 3L (compared to 91-94%).
In the ED, her VS were notable for BP 110/70, HR 140s with ST depressions in V4-V6, RR 30s.
Her CXR was felt to be consistent with CHF so she was given an additional 40 mg IV lasix with 530 cc UO.
She remained tachypneic so she was placed on Bipap for 35 minutes with improvement in her oxygenation and shortness of breath.
She was given a dose of vancomycin and was transferred to the ICU for further management and supportive care.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient noted mild shortness of breath but denied lightheadedness, palpitations, or chest pain.
She reports an 8lb weight gain over the prior week with increasing abdominal girth and lower extremity edema.

OP: MM mildly dry appearing Neck: JVP 9-10cm vertical.
Non-tender Back: large ecchymosis over right buttock [**1-23**] recent BM Bx Extremity: warm, [**1-24**]+ pitting edema to knees bilaterally.
Hypercellular bone marrow for age with erythroid hyperplasia, see note.
Abundant megakaryocytes are seen, which are in keeping with peripheral destruction/sequestration as a cause of patient's thrombocytopenia.
[**2139-2-10**]: blood cx x2 no growth [**2139-2-10**]: urine cx no growth [**2139-2-11**]: urine cx no growth .
The liver shows coarsened echotexture with nodular architecture consistent with chronic liver disease.
No focal mass is seen within the liver.
There is a contracted gallbladder containing multiple stones.
There is no gallbladder wall edema or evidence of cholecystitis.
The right lower quadrant was marked for paracentesis by clinical team.
Smoothly thickened septal lines and ground glass opacities are most consistent with hydrostatic pulmonary edema, especially in the setting of a right pleural effusion and known cardiac disease.
However, this process could potentially obscure underlying chronic interstitial disease, and if clinically indicated, repeat scanning following diuresis could be performed.
Several scattered noncalcified sub 5-mm nodular opacities within the right lung, possibly representing noncalcified granulomas given the presence of other calcified granulomas.
However, followup CT in three months is recommended to document stability and to exclude a neoplastic etiology.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Cirrhotic-appearing liver, with moderate amount of ascites and splenomegaly.
Coronary artery calcifications.
[**2139-2-17**] ECHO: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated, with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is at least moderate aortic stenosis, but accurate quantification of its severity was technically limited.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe mitral annular calcification and moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
There is mild mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2).
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional systolic function.
Dilated right ventricle with mild systolic dysfunction.
At least moderate aortic stenosis.
Mild mitral stenosis.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
[**2139-2-17**] CAROTID U/S: Less than 40% stenosis of the proximal internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
Brief Hospital Course: # MICU course: In the MICU, the patient was stablized with IVF, however her laboratory values showed a severe hemolytic reaction with an rise in her total bilirubin to 21, a drop in her hematocrit to 23, acute renal failure with a creatinine of 2, and LDH >800 and haptoglobin <20.
Cardiology and renal were consulted to help guide further management, given that she was in need of diuresis in the setting of severe aortic stenosis and acute renal failure.
She become hypotensive when diuresis was attempted with IV lasix.
She was switched to a lasix gtt with improvement in her diuresis and less change in her blood pressure.
She was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 for continued diuresis and CT surgery evaluation for valve replacement.
# CV: 1) CHF - Her recent ECHO and cardiac MRI reveal moderate to severe aortic stenosis, with [**Location (un) 109**] 0.8cm2, likely causing her CHF in the setting of volume overload.
She also has 3+ MR, 1+ TR, and pulmonary artery hypertension.
She was started on a lasix gtt for diuresis given that she was in renal failure and was not making large volumes of diuresis.
2) CAD - Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a clean cath in [**2137**].
However, she also had troponin elevation from <.01 to .17 in the setting of tachycardia, hypotension, hemolysis, and ARF.
She was not able to receive aspirin given her thrombocytopenia and she could not take an ACE-I given her hypotension and acute renal failure.
3) Rhythm - She remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout most of her hosptialization, with short beats of NSVT.
Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction: She developed an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction in the setting of her recent Winrho infusion.
# Thrombocytopenia - Her platelets were 38 after the Winrho infusion, but then came up to 83 by the time of discharge.
Hepatology was concerned that her thrombocytopenia may also be a result of her liver disease.
Hypoxia - The etiology of her hypoxia is most likely multifactorial, with elements of volume overload, CHF, and valvular disease contributing.
She also has evidence of pulmonary artery hypertension on ECHO.
Her CT chest from [**2-12**] was consistent with CHF, as was her clinical exam.
She has a questionable diagnosis of ILD in the past, with PFTs c/w a restrictive pattern.
Acute renal failure: She likely developed ATN from hypotension and hemoglobinuria.
Hepatology feels that the patient is Child's class B at baseline, but now is a class C given the recent events, which makes her operative mortality high.
Type 2 DM - Her FS remained elevated throughout her hospitalization, requiring uptitration of her lantus dose.
The etiology of her hyperglycemia was not clear.
Anemia - Her hematocrit dropped to 23 post-Winrho infusion, and then trended down to 21.
She was given 1u pRBC to see if that would improve her dyspnea and renal perfusion and her Hct bumped to 25.7.
No further transfusions were given as we were trying to limit her fluid intake.
She also had one  guaiaic positive stool on [**2-18**], but had no further episodes.
Excessive phlebotomy might also be contributing to her anemia as she was having labs checked [**Hospital1 **] to replete her electrolytes.
Hyponatremia - She developed a hyposmolar, hypervolemic hyponatremia likely secondary to heart failure.
FEN - She was given a diabetic, low sodium diet.
PPX - She was ordered for pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis, but the patient did not wear them due to her low plts.
She tried to ambulate for short distances daily.
Access - Perpiheral IVs .
