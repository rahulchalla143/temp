HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease (status post a coronary artery bypass graft with one thrombosed graft as of [**2184**]) who presented with multiple episodes of coffee-grounds emesis at his nursing home on the day of admission.
He has also had brown loose diarrhea with multiple sick contacts at his nursing home.
He denied any abdominal pain.
Atrial fibrillation.
Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2176**].
Congestive heart failure.
Chronic renal failure (with a baseline creatinine of 2.1).
Peripheral vascular disease.
A left eye thrombosis.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Peptic ulcer disease.
ALLERGIES:  Allergies included a possible allergy to CONTRAST.
He was in some mild respiratory distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed mucous membranes were dry.
Minimal jugular venous distention.
His cardiovascular examination revealed a tachycardic heart that was irregular with faint heart sounds.
The lungs revealed coarse breath sounds bilaterally with rhonchi; especially at the right base.
The abdomen revealed a midline abdominal scar which was well-healed; otherwise, the abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and with present bowel sounds (but diminished).
The extremities showed no ulcers and 1+ ankle edema bilaterally with venous stasis dermatitis.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at 136 with a left bundle-branch block.
A chest x-ray showed evidence of right lower lobe infiltrate.
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION:  The patient ruled for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes due to demand ischemia; likely related to tachycardia from his anemia.
Because of his myocardial infarction, he went into new heart failure which was documented by a cardiac echocardiogram which documented a new ejection fraction during this hospital stay of about 20% to 25%.
ANEMIA SECONDARY TO GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient bled down to a hematocrit of approximately 34.
He needed about five units of fresh frozen plasma to reverse his coagulopathy due to Coumadin.
He had no further episodes of active hematemesis.
The Gastroenterology team saw the patient in consultation and decided not to do an upper endoscopy due to his acute myocardial infarction.
He continued to do well and was transferred to the floor with no further episodes of bleeding and guaiac-negative stools since.
A possible etiology was peptic ulcer disease versus an arteriovenous malformation versus [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear.
PNEUMONIA/TACHYPNEA:  Pneumonia and tachypnea was thought likely due to acute uremia and lactic acidosis, but also with concern for pneumonia.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  He had a mild increase in his creatinine which basically resolved as his cardiac issues resolved.
PULMONARY EDEMA:  With his new ejection fraction, the patient had pulmonary edema and was diuresed gently with his standing dose of Lasix of 80 mg p.o.
He had an oxygen requirement of approximately 2 liters to 3 liters of oxygen which decreased by the time of discharge.
METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS SCREEN:  He did have a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus screen here of the nares which were positive.
DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient had episodes of fasting hypoglycemia; and accordingly, his evening dose of NPH was titrated down to achieve a satisfactory glucose in the morning.
Status post myocardial infarction related to demand ischemia due to anemia.
Atrial fibrillation.
Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery bypass graft.
Diabetes mellitus.
Congestive heart failure (with a new ejection fraction of 20%).
Chronic renal failure.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Peptic ulcer disease.
Left lower quadrant surgery.
