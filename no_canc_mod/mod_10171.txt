The patient was discharged from his stay on a four drug TB regimen, HAART including Trizivir and Abacavir and Coumadin for left iliac deep vein thrombosis, prednisone 20 for a paradoxical reaction.
He was re-admitted on this admission on [**5-31**] for a three day history of fevers to 103 with only other symptoms being nocturia.
ALLERGIES:  Patient has no known drug allergies.
In general, he was a cachectic but well-appearing male in no acute distress.
The heart was regular, tachycardic with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left sternal border.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended without hepatosplenomegaly.
His extremities showed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Skin showed no rashes.
Back: There was a question of mild left CVA tenderness.
Urinalysis showed nitrate positive with 3-5 white blood cell and moderate bacteria.
Admission laboratories were also notable for a sodium of 130, potassium 4.0, chloride 98, bicarbonate 20, BUN 19, creatinine 1.0, glucose 88, parathyroid hormone 11, viral culture showed herpes simplex 1 on his lip confirmed by monoclonal fluorescent antibody.
A chest x-ray had no infiltrates.
The patient received the following tests while a patient:  A chest x-ray which showed no infiltrates.
An MRI of the had which had no lesions.
An MRI of the neck which showed likely lymphadenopathy of the left neck.
An MRI of the abdomen which was unremarkable when compared to previous although showed multiple fluids collections.
An ultrasound of the neck which showed probable abscess.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed gastritis and duodenitis.
Renal ultrasound showed diffusely echogenic patterns, otherwise, normal kidneys.
A work-up was done including multiple cultures and imaging without any source of fever ever identified.
An MRI of the neck was significant for collectional lymph nodes that may have been there previously.
MRI of the abdomen showed multiple fluid collections, although, most likely improved or unchanged from previous CT imaging.
An MRI of the L spine was done due to complaints of back pain which was essentially normal.
The patient was treated for a urinary tract infection with levofloxacin for three days.
Upon discharge, the patient had been afebrile for 48 hours but a source of infection being found.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient was started on heparin and discontinued on Coumadin in anticipation of her renal biopsy.
On the evening of starting the heparin, the patient had several episodes of hematemesis and bright red blood per rectum.
The patient then became hypotensive, received several units of blood and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, esophagogastroduodenoscopy which was significant for gastritis and duodenitis, although, was H. Pylori negative, a colonoscopy done several days later was essentially normal.
Renal:  The patient began having an increase in creatinine with a normal BUN.
Renal consult was obtained and biopsy was eventually deferred since her creatinine went down to 1.2, although, this was felt most likely to be a drug reaction due to Tenofovir.
An ultrasound was done which showed diffusely echogenic pattern which would be most consistent with an infiltrative process or a drug reaction.
Bactrim was stopped due to possibly causing the increased creatinine as was Tenofovir.
Hematology:  The patient started having a decreasing white blood cell count on the week prior to admission which had a nadir of 1.2.
Anemia:  The patient was chronically anemic and had a several unit requirement during his gastrointestinal bleed.
After the bleed, he was hemodynamically stable and had no more blood requirement.
Musculoskeletal:  The patient complained of aches and muscular pains in his legs and back pain.
Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  Hyponatremia:  The patient was chronically hyponatremic and was treated with fluid restriction and had resolved by the time of his discharge.
