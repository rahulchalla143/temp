History of Present Illness: This 66 year old black male with significant non-ischemic cardiomyopathy who underwent ICD implant in [**2128**].
He has NYHA Class II congestive heart failure with an EF of 30%.
The patient was hospitalized in [**2132-9-11**] for a CHF exacerbation treated with intravenous diuretics.
The patient reports a moderate limitation with physical activity and a low energy level.
The patient reports shortness of breath with mild exertion relieved with rest.
The patient denies lightheadedness, palpitations, pre syncope, syncope or chest pain.
recent interrogation of his device revealed that he had episodes of non sustained VT, no episodes of sustained VT and no therapies were delivered.
Past Medical History: Non ischemic cardionyopathy s/p gastric bypass hypertension gout obstructive sleep apnea  Social History: Married and retired police officer.
Family History: Grandmother with CAD but no premature CAD in family.
Left ventricular function.
Right ventricular function.
Shortness of breath.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
Dilated LV cavity.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Borderline PA systolic hypertension.
No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal views.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with grossly preserved contractility but views are suboptimal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
He developed epigastric pain and a surgery consult was obtained.
No acute surgical issues were found beyond colonic ileus and he was transferred to the cardiac surgery intensive care unit for monitoring.
Attempts at gastric and rectal tube placement were unsuccessful (there was no stomach distention).
