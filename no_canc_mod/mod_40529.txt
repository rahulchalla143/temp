M with ESRD on HD (last HD [**First Name3 (LF) 2974**] [**2137-9-20**]), s/p kidney transplant x 2 ([**2121**], [**2129**])with progressive renal disease, chronic rejection and renal failure (listed for kidney transplant, but inactive due to underlying liver cirrhosis), HCV c/b cirrhosis and ascites (requiring serial therpeutic paracentesis), PVD, CHF (EF 45%, systolic and diastolic dysfunction), labile HTN with recent admissions ([**2137-4-11**], [**2137-8-11**]) for hypertensive emergency requiring labetolol gtts, who presented to ED with visual changes.
Patinet reports that he's had nonpainful visual changes for 7 days described as a "shade coming over his eye".
Patient found to be hypertensive to 221/107 and started on Nipride gtt with additional 10 iv & 50 PO of Hydral and responded well with resultant BPs in the 140's.
Patinet also seen by Ophtho who thought that the visual changes were likely due to acute optic nerve ischemia in setting of hypertension.
Head CT was negative for intracranial process and CXR was negative as well.
Past Medical History: -Seizure disorder -ESRD on HD (M,W,F) due to idiopathic glomerulonephritis, s/p 2  failed renal transplants -labile hypertension -hypothyroidism -peripheral [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] disease -hypoparathyroidism -hepatitis C -CHF-systolic w/ EF 45% and diastolic dysfunction (echo [**12/2135**]) -SVT/AVNRT s/p ablation -multiple fistulas -H/O MRSA line infection -Recent admission [**2136-2-29**] for infected L upper arm AV fistula.
Family History: Mother with breast CA; father alive with CAD & CHF; sons healthy.
CT w/o contrast on [**9-21**]: There has been no change in the appearance of the brain compared with prior study.
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of midline structures, or loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation.
The posterior fossa is unchanged, with slight prominence of extra-axial space.
Calcification of the cavernous carotids again noted.
There is again noted to be partial opacification of the left mastoid air cells.
No acute intrathoracic process.
No acute infarcts.
Moderate degree of small vessel ischemic changes.
MRA of the neck is limited due to patient motion, but no gross abnormalities are seen.
Moderate perihepatic ascites.
EEG [**9-26**]: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine sampling and spike and seizure detection programs demonstrated several episodes of brief generalized polyspike and wave discharges as well as several multifocal spike and wave discharges.
The discharges were never repetitive or sustained.
The second is suggestive of an underlying encephalopathy which could be due to deeper midline or subcortical dysfunction.
Assessment: 58M with h/o epilepsy, ESRD on HD s/p 2 failed kidney tranplants, HCV cirrhosis, PVD, CHF, labile hypertension admitted with hypertensive emergency  and nonarteric ischemic optic neuropathy (R eye).
Pt originally presented to the ED c/o decreased vision in his R eye, and was found to have BPs in the 220s/110s.
Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient also had acutely altered mental status thought to be due to hepatic encephalopathy.
The patient did have a seizure thought to be due to missing 1-2 doses of seizure meds while encephalopathic, but now is back on his po anti-seizure regimen.
# AMS: hypertensive encephalopathy vs. hepatic encephalopathy vs. uremic encephalophy medication side effects vs. prolonged post-ictal state.
h/o epilepsy on Keppra and Lamictal on admission.
AMS shortly after admission to MICU thought to be secondary to Perocet given for H. Zoster or olanzapine given for sleep.
MRI/MRA without contrast of neck and head negative.
Altered mental status thought to be due to encephalopathy compounded by prolonged post-ictal state.
# Rectal bleeding- BRBPR s/p PR lactulose in ICU.
Trace positive stools in ED.
Currently hemodynamically stable with no repeat guaiac positive stools in unit.
Possible due to underlying hemorrhoids, although may be secondary to bowel hypoperfusion.
Lactate in ED was 1.2, not suggestive of mesenteric ischemia.
Polyps c/w esophagitis, duodenitis.
Colonoscopy [**2-17**] showing grade 2 hemorrhoids and no rectal varies, minimal blood loss precipitated by lactulose enema.
# HTN Emergency - Unclear of patient compliance with medications with evidence of end organ ishcemia to his right eye.
# Herpes Zoster - Patient has had occasional L flank pain preceeding the vesicles in the distribution of L2-3.
not c/o Zoster pain currently.
# Right eye optic nerve ischemia - Patient seen by Ophtho in ED.
Guarded to poor prognosis in terms of regaining vision and will follow up in clinic next week (would be [**9-28**]).
Patient also developed superficial keratitis and was prescribed erythromycin ointment by ophtho.
CAD: Patient without evidence of ischemia.
On aggressive outpatient antihypertensive regimen, thought to be due to renal disease -RHYTHM:  No issues at this point.
# Hyperkalemia - -corrected with HD .
# ESRD on HD: To HD on M/W/F via R Hickman catheter.
Patient has bilateral nonfunctioning AV fistulas in forearms.
# Anemia - [**3-15**] chronic renal disease: Hct baseline 30.
# PVD s/p bilateral common iliac stents: continued aspirin and plavix per outpatient regimen.
# Epilepsy: h/o primary generalized epilepsy since childhood with h/o paroxysmal episodes of confusion due to nonconvulsive seizures.
