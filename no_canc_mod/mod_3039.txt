Admission Date:  [**2163-3-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-3-26**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Pneumovax 23  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea on exertion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pacemaker placement  History of Present Illness: 88yo F Russian speaking woman with dCHF, s/p AVR 3 years ago, SSS with baseline HR in the 40s, feeling week and tired today with heart rates in the 30s.
Patient has had "good days" and "bad days" with some days feeling very tired and fatigued and other days feeling more energetic.
Noted dyspnea on exertion and some accompanied chest pressure with exertion and nausea.
Denies any fevers or chills but does endorse ~5lbs weight loss over the past several months and decreased appetite.
She complained of some mild headache and continued to have some baseline orthopnea.
Labs were drawn and she was admitted to the CCU to be started on a low dose dopamine infusion and is due for PPM implantation in the AM.

This represented a marked change from previous ECGs that showed NSR or sinus bradycardia with short-normal PR interval, and minor, nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay, with QRS duration 110-120 msec.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**1-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CXR [**2163-3-26**]: There has been placement of new left-sided pacemaker with the distal lead tips in the right atrium, right ventricle and appropriately sited.
There are low lung volumes with crowding of the pulmonary vascular markings.
There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
No large areas of consolidation are seen.
There are no pneumothoraces.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: 88yoF, Russian speaking, dCHF (preserved EF), s/p AVR 3 years ago, presenting with symptomatic bradycardia and some CP on ambulation.
# Syptomatic bradycardia: Pt with hx of SSS w/o pacemaker as she had previously been asymptomatic, now with fatigue, DOE and HR in the 30s.
However, EKG and troponins did not suggest any ischemia and the patient went for ppm placement.
Patient tolerated procedure well with improvement in her HR and systolic pressures, she had resolution of symptoms with pacer placement.
Post procedural CXR demonstrated no effusions or pneumothroax and correct placment of leads.
# Hypotension: Patient had episode of hypotension to the 90s and concurrent chest pain.
There were no other symptoms or laboratory abnormalities.
This was felt to be related to her bradycardia and improved after placer placement.
# Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure:   Patient had no symptoms or exam findings suggestive of an acute exacerbation though did have pulmonary edema noted on CXR and hyperkalemia.
Felt to be prerenal in the setting of poor forward flow and kidney hypoperfusion.
# CAD: pt had CP but cardiac enzymes and EKG were negative for signs of ischemia.
# Dementia: stable.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for a slow heart beat.
