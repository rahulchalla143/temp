Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
[**10-27**] CXR - This study is extremely limited by low lung volumes and motion.
Prominence of the pulmonary vasculature may reflect pulmonary edema and/or crowding of structures due to low lung volumes.
[**10-28**] CXR - There are persistent low lung volumes.
Mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette is accentuated by the low lung volumes and their projection.
If any, there are small bilateral pleural effusions.
There is mild vascular congestion.
Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity has increased, a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.
No changes have newly occurred.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 81 yo F with history of COPD, dementia, HTN presenting with dyspnea/hypoxia, likely related to PNA and septic physiology.
# Respiratory Status: Patient was admitted with elevated WCC, CXR w lower lobe consolidations bilaterally and new onset dyspnea/hypoxia.
#Bacterial Conjunctivitis: Pt admitted with bilateral injection of sclera with pus-like exudate.
# Hypotension: Patient admitted with hypotension most likely from septic etiology given source of PNA.
Was treated as discussed above, briefly required peripheral pressors, but was then able to maintain MAPs >65 without support.
# Acute Kidney Injury on chronic kidney disease: Admitted with Cr 2.1 up from baseline of 1.2.
Likely pre-renal associated with hypotension [**3-13**] sepsis.
Cr resolved with volume resuscitation.
# Heart Failure: Day#3 of hospitalization, CXR demonstrated and CXR increased infiltrates and effusions thought to be secondary to CHF.
#Acute Respiratory Failure: Despite treatment of PNA and CHF, patient had increasing O2 requirements.
Medications on Admission: # Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheeze.
# Spiriva with HandiHaler 18 mcg Capsule, w/Inhalation Device Sig: One (1) capsule Inhalation once a day.
# Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation every six (6) hours # Erythromycin eye gtt 0.5 inch strip QID start [**10-26**] x10 days # Flovent 220 mcg IH [**Hospital1 **] # Lasix 60 mg PO BID  Discharge Medications: none  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: acute respiratory failure [**3-13**] pneumonia  Discharge Condition: expired at 8:58pm [**2125-10-30**]
