She had no headaches, no visual changes, positive dry cough times two days with shortness of breath, no chest pain, no abdominal pain, no dysuria.
Rheumatoid arthritis on Prednisone status post urethral dilation, status post bilateral hemothorax with inferior pubic rami fracture, C2, C3 stress fracture, lower lumbar spine 3 through 5 fracture of the transverse process, status post liver laceration with ERCP and biliary stents placed, all status post motor vehicle accident on [**10-19**].
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to SULFA.
Heart revealed regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.

Workup showed no clear source, except for a small volume left retrocardiac infiltrate and urinalysis with moderate bacteria.
The patient had vomiting at rehabilitation, but no abdominal pain now.
The abdominal CT showed biliary stent in place.
The CT showed air in the biliary system consistent with prior stent and subacute hypodensity in the right lobe consistent with prior laceration, overall clear source of infection.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Fever, gram-negative covered for moderate bacteria, urine + or -, coverage for cholangitis, if she becomes less stable.
T wave decreased in Q, old Qs with no clear history of CAD and no chest pain.
RENAL:  Mild ARF resolving with IV fluid.
The patient with horseshoe kidney and ureteral abnormality, increased risk for UTI and pyelonephritis, follow creatinines, IV hydration, avoid nephrotoxic drugs.
LINES:  The patient has peripheral line, prophylaxis, she is on Lovenox, status post inferior vena cava filter which was placed prophylactically due to the motor vehicle accident.
The patient then had a CT of the abdomen which noted abscess in the abdomen.
Second CT was performed of the liver showing minor fluid in the abscess and it was felt via the Department of Infectious Disease that this would be treated with the IV antibiotic.
Echocardiogram was performed, which showed left atrium normal size, ejection fraction greater than 55%, no pericardial effusion and normal heart function.
Urine culture, final, on [**2131-11-25**] showed no growth.
Wound culture showed mixed bacterial types.
Abscess drainage showed Enterococcus, which was sensitive to Ampicillin, Levofloxacin, and Penicillin, and Vancomycin.

Stool culture, on [**2131-11-18**], revealed Clostridium difficile negative.
12 hours, which will continue for six weeks to treat appropriately the abscess bacteria, which was found on gram stain and culture.
The patient will followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] in two to three weeks for cervical fracture assessment.
The patient has an incidental finding on chest x-ray and CT of pulmonary hilar lymphadenopathy.
The patient ruled out via enzymes and troponin I less than .3.
The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation as planned with the followup with Infectious Disease Clinic, [**Hospital **] Clinic for cervical fracture issue as well as pulmonary for hilar lymphadenopathy-issue followup.
