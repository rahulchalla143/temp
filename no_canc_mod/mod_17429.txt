This pregnancy was complicated by hepatitis B antigen positive maternal status and an echogenic cardiac focus prenatally.
There was spontaneous onset of labor leading to spontaneous vaginal delivery under epidural anesthesia.
The mother was febrile on admission with a peak temperature intrapartum of greater than 103 degrees in association with sustained fetal tachycardia.
Rupture of membranes occurred 10 hours prior to delivery and yielded clear amniotic fluid.
Small left occipital parietal caput.
No nasal flaring.
CNS: Mildly lethargic with responsiveness to moderate stimuli.
The infant did have episodes of apnea after crying.
The     most recent episode of apnea after crying was on [**12-10**], [**2128**].
No further hematocrits or     platelets have been measured.
The CBC was not     left shifted, and there was a normal white blood cell     count; but due to the maternal temperature of 103 in the     mother and the infant was admitted with a temperature of     103.6, the infant was planned for a 7-day course of     ampicillin and gentamicin.
A chest x-ray     was done which did not show any focal areas and was     normal.
NEUROLOGY: The infant has maintained a normal neurologic     exam for a term infant.
No medications.
Infant also received Hepatitis Immuneglobulin due to maternal hepatitis B positive status.
