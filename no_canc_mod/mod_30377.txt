No fluoroscopic evidence of gastric perforation.

Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY: 58M with 5.7cm infra-renal/juxta-renal AAA who presented for open AAA resection-suprarenal cross clamp, with intraoperative course complicated splenic laceration requiring splenectomy, and post-operative course complicated by small gastric fundal perforation requiring endoclipping.
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was brought to the OR on [**2199-12-30**] for open repair of juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with 14 mm tube graft.
Intraoperative bleeding with splenic laceration was noted, for which the ACS service was consulted, and ultimately performed a splenectomy during the same procedure (attending surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
On POD5 erythema surrounding his midline vertical abdominal incision was noted and he was begun on cefazolin given concern for a superficial skin infection.
VICU and floor course: Prior to initiating clears on HD8, the patient had serosanguineous output from his 2 flank JP drains in the splenic bed.
Following initiation of clears on POD7, however, JP output markedly increased to over a liter per day from each drain.
Given the change in JP output and a persistently uptrending WBC count, the patient underwent a CTA torso on POD 8, [**2200-1-7**], which showed a small gastric perforation along the greater curvature of the stomach.
In discussion between the ACS service and the gastroenterology service, the patient underwent an endocscopy-guided clipping (over the scope clipping, OTSC) of the gastric fundus perforation on [**2200-1-8**] by the GI service, without complication.
JP output markedly decreased post procedure.
CT a/p on [**2200-1-9**] (POD 10) with contrast via NGT showed no active extravasation, UGI series on [**2200-1-14**] confirmed no extravasation, and the NGT was removed on [**2200-1-14**] (POD 15).
Repeat CT a/p on [**2200-1-15**] again showed no active extravasation, and demonstrated a small residual peri-splenic bed collection (residual 9 x 2.7 x 3.4 cm subphrenic collection).
On discharge he was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating independently, with pain well controlled on oral medications.
Regarding his pulse-exam post operatively, he had palpable distal pulses throughout his post-operative period.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital after a repair of your abdominal aortic aneurysm on [**2199-12-30**].
Your spleen was also removed, and a small perforation in your stomach was repaired with an endoclip.
We have started you on several new medications, metoprolol (lopressor) for high blood pressure, pantoprazole (protonix) for stomach acid, aspirin for your blood vessels and metformin for high blood sugars.
