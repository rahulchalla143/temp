Sinus tachycardia.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with associated ST-T wave changes, although ischemia or myocardial infarction cannot be excluded.
Recommend repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis to assess for underlying infection.
TTE [**5-10**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: A [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman with history of [**Age over 90 1291**], CAD s/p CABG, PAF, diastolic CHF, now presenting with fever, leukocytosis and respiratory distress, admitted to the MICU for persistent tachypnea.
# Respiratory distress/tachypnea.
Other considerations include pulmonary edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction versus acute coronary syndrome.
Her symptoms were felt to be most consistent with pneumonia.
She was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone and vancomycin) and her symptoms improved.
On the second hospital day, her tachypnea was improving and her oxygen requirements decreased.
Her respiratory status remained stable, with only mild expiratory wheezes.
She was transferred to a rehab center with instructions to complete a fourteen day course of levofloxacin, for her pneumonia as well as her bacteremia (see below).
# Bacteremia: One blood culture from admission labs came back positive for STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE, sensitive to levofloxacin.
TTE showed no vegetations, but they could reportedly not be ruled out, due to suboptimal study.
# Hypotension.
Her hypotension improved to baseline.
# Diastolic CHF: Patient was euvolemic on exam, although CXR suggested pulmonary edema.
BNP, as above, was elevated but less than prior values.
An echocardiogram was performed during this admission, showing findings similar to her prior echo, except for possibly increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
# CAD s/p CABG.
EKG shows new increased voltage consistent with LVH.
# Depression, anxiety, insomnia.
No active concerns.
# Acute kidney injury.

You were also found to have an infection in your blood.
You were given antibiotics intravenously and orally, and your symptoms improved.
Last dose will be on [**2130-5-18**] - Started ALBUTEROL SULFATE nebulizer, one nebulizer treatment every six hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheeze - Started IPRATROPIUM BROMIDE nebulizer, one nebulizer treatment every six hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheeze  Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you experience any fevers, worsening shortness of breath or chest pain, or other new concerning symptoms.
