[**2122-11-7**]: CXR Portable: IMPRESSION: Prominent pulmonary hila consistent with known pulmonary emboli.
No evidence of other pulmonary abnormality.
FINDINGS: Within the bilateral pulmonary arteries, there are multiple filling defects consistent with pulmonary emboli.
Emboli within the right upper lobe branches, right middle lobe branches and right lower lobe branches are identified.
In addition, emboli in the left upper lobe branches and left lower lobe branches are identified.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions identified.
Degenerative changes throughout the thoracic spine are noted.

Bilateral PEs: patient was initially monitored in the ICU given extent of clot burden, but always remained hemodynamically stable.
CTA showed significant b/l pulmonary embolisms, with extensive clot burden.
He did not receive thrombolysis given hemodynamic stability.
Hypercoagulation work-up was deferred given the history of PE in setting of extensive air travel as well as possibility of confounding results while on anticoagulation.
Leukocytosis: mild leukocytosis of 12.1 on admission, likely related to his PE versus his recent URI symptoms.
Patient's WBC normalized and he was afebrile throughout hospitalization.
Chronic venous insufficiency: patient with mild RLE and LLE swelling.
Medications on Admission: Avapro 300mg daily Darvocet-N 50mg/325mg q4-6 hrs PRN Meridia 15mg daily Prilosec 20mg daily MVI Flex Seed Oil  Discharge Medications: 1.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Bilateral Pulmonary Emboli   Discharge Condition: good, ambulatory on room air, denies chest pain or shortness of breath, tolerating food well   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital3 **] hospital after being diagnosed with bilateral blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary emboli) at the outside hospital ([**Hospital3 6592**]).
You were initially in the intensive care unit for concern of hemodynamic instability, but you did quite well and were quickly weaned off supplemental oxygen.
