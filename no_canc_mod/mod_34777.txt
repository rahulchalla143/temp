She was first seen for evaluation of her liver disease in [**State 4565**] and [**State 8780**] in [**2124-5-21**].
During that travel she developed severe itching associated with extremity swelling and edema.
On laboratories she was noted to have elevated liver function tests and subsequently progressed to "near fulminant liver failure."
She underwent a liver biopsy on [**2124-6-13**] which showed reactive hepatocytes, cholestasis, and inflammatory infiltrate.
The biopsy was felt to be consistent with autoimmune hepatitis, drug reaction or extra-hepatic obstruction.
She was started on immuran and prednisone on [**2124-6-21**] for presumed autoimmune hepatitis with plans to also undertake an MRCP to assess for sclerosing cholangitis.
Per OSH notes she did have an MRCP but report not available to us at [**Hospital1 18**].
Between [**2124-6-21**] and [**2124-7-14**] her total bilirubin decreased from 21 to 17 (direct 9.8) with a decrease in her transaminases to AST 176 and ALT 223 with alkaline phosphatase of 213.
On the day prior to admission, she complained of fever and chills and had a recorded temperature of 102.
A CT of head, by report, demonstrated a left frontal mass and left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she was found to be hypothermic and hypotensive, and was placed on pressors.
Bronchitis 3. per report, evaluated at [**Doctor Last Name 21721**] for arthritis in [**2124-4-20**]   Social History: Patient lives in [**State 8780**] and was visiting family members in [**Name2 (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].
This trip was part of an educational exchange program, for which she serves on the board of directors.

[**Month/Year (2) **] ET tube, NG tube and for pneumonia or CHF.
The lungs are clear, without evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
There is bibasilar atelectasis amd a probable small left basal effusion.
There is mild degenerative change in the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
[**9-14**] CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST  INDICATION: Subarachnoid hemorrhage, with new mass, seizure, [**Month/Year (2) 4656**] for interval change and please compare with outside hospital CT.
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired contiguous axial images of the head were obtained without intravenous contrast.
FINDINGS: There is a 4.3 x 2 cm area of low attenuation in the left frontal lobe with minimal surrounding edema and mild mass effect.
There is bilateral fronto-parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There is no intraventricular hemorrhage.
There are no fractures.
IMPRESSION: Large area of left frontal low attenuation lesion, which may represent acute infarct or tumor.
In addition there is bilateral fronto- parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage without significant midline shift This is not significantly changed since the study at 5:30 a.m. from the same date.
[**9-14**] MRI OF THE HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST, [**2124-9-14**]; MRA OF THE HEAD, [**2124-9-14**]  INDICATION: 60-year-old woman with new intracranial mass, hemorrhage, and seizures.
[**Year (4 digits) **] for mass or aneurysm.
FINDINGS: Within the left frontal lobe, there is a heterogeneous region containing focal regions of peripheral enhancement.
The focus of abnormal signal encompasses approximately 4.2 x 2.7 cm.
In addition to this dominant focus, there are several punctate foci of high signal on diffusion-weighted sequences, including the right frontal lobe, lateral to the right caudate, left temporal, and right parietal lobes.
While no definite low signal can be demonstrated on the ADC reconstructions, these foci may also represent small infarcts.
Septic emboli are a differential consideration.
As demonstrated on the recent CT, there is subarachnoid blood layering within the sulci bilaterally.
There are bifrontal subdural collections, most prominent in the frontal regions, where they measure up to 6 mm in thickness.
There is heterogeneous FLAIR signal intensity, which could suggest the presence of blood products.
There is a prominent vessel coursing along the surface of the right frontal lobe, with a prominent parenchymal focus of linear enhancement.
This likely represents a developmental venous anomaly.
There is no significant intracranial stenosis.
There is no aneurysm.
There is no midline shift.
Large abnormality within the left frontal lobe characterized by peripheral enhancement, surrounding edema, blood products, and restricted diffusion.
Differential considerations for this lesion would include an abscess with associated hemorrhage versus an infarct with hemorrhage.
There are numerous punctate foci of abnormal signal bilaterally which may also represent either small infarcts or septic emboli.
Bilateral subdural fluid collections, most prominent in the frontal regions, where they measure up to 6 mm in thickness.
There is heterogeneous signal within it, which could suggest the presence of acute blood product.
Right frontal developmental venous anomaly.
[**2124-9-19**] EEG: FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: Focal and lateralized slowing was noted toward the end of the record with 1-2 Hz slower theta and faster delta from the left mid-temporal, central, posterior temporal, and parietal regions.
The posterior rhythm was relatively low to moderate voltage and of a pseudoperiodic nature verging on a burst-voltage reduction pattern not as extreme as a burst suppression pattern.
CARDIAC MONITOR: No arrhythmias noted.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to a burst-reduction and pseudoperiodic record overall with marked slowing in the theta and delta range with additional focal and lateralized slowing in the left mid to posterior head regions without associated spike or sharp discharges.
This would suggest a diffuse encephalopathy of a moderate to moderately severe degree with accentuated slowing over the left hemisphere from the mid to posterior regions suggestive of a possible structural or destructive process in that area.
No epileptiform abnormalities were noted, however.
There is focal thickening of the right coronary cusp of the aortic valve which measures 0.5 x 0.5 cm; cannot exclude valvular vegetation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Focal thickening of the right coronary cusp of the aortic valve without aortic regurgitation.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would better assess for endocarditis.
Increased enhancement and mild increase in surrounding edema in the left frontal lesion, which now demonstrates intrinsic slow diffusion, consistent with an abscess.
Additional areas of new enhancement are seen in the right frontal lobe and in the region of right caudate head.
New small bilateral frontal hypointense effusions.
Diffuse in meningeal enhancement which could be due to meningeal inflammation.
Bilateral extensive mastoid middle ear and sphenoid sinus soft tissue changes.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There are filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant).
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No vegetations or clinically-significant regurgitant valvular disease.
No PFO, ASD, or cardiac source of embolism seen.
MRCP, [**2124-10-7**]  INDICATION: 60-year-old woman with history of autoimmune hepatitis.
FINDINGS: There is a right pleural effusion.
There is multifocal abnormal, patchy, linearly-oriented T2 signal abnormality throughout the liver, in a pattern suggestive of bridging fibrosis.
There are no focal lesions.
The regions of fibrosis are associated with capsular retraction.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
No definite gallstones are identified.
Spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and adrenals are grossly normal, allowing for limitations of non-breath-hold technique.
Subcutaneous edema is noted.
Note is made of Tarlov cysts associated with several sacral nerve roots.
IMPRESSION: Morphologic changes and diffuse abnormal signal throughout the liver, in keeping with hepatitic fibrosis.
No biliary dilatation.
Continuous fluoroscopic observation was provided during administration of multiple consistencies of barium.
The patient displayed moderate to severe oral phase swallow dysfunction with decreased tongue propulsion, and delayed swallow initiation.
Mild residue was also noted within the valleculae bilaterally with nectar and puree consistencies.
Focused examination of the vocal cords was not possible as no phonation was able to be elicited from the patient.
Mild decrease in the size of the small enhancing lesion, in the head of the caudate nucleus on the right side and a few smaller lesions noted in the right centrum semiovale and in the left centrum semiovale adjacent to the largest lesion in the left frontal lobe, which itself has not signficantly changed.
No new lesions.
Bilateral moderate subdural fluid collections are unchanged.
Unchanged diffuse fluid/mucosal thickening in the mastoid air cells on both sides.
There is still mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, though the vascular status is certainly improved from the previous examination.
Probable mild atelectatic change in the retrocardiac region at the left base.

#) Listeria bacteremia and meningitis/encephalitis/abscess and resultant altered mental status: .
Listeria noted in blood and CSF cultures from [**9-15**] and [**9-16**] respectively.
Her recently immuno-suppressed state secondary to steroid and azathioprine treatment for auto-immune hepatitis may have pre-disposed her to infection.
Initial imaging revealed small SAH and large mass, likely abscess with several satellite lesions.
?s and MRIs have been stable showing large left hemisphere lesion and  and interval resoluton of bleed and multiple septic emboli.
TTE and TEE completed as noted (abnormal, but no definite abscess or vegetation).
EEG was not suggestive of convulsive status.
- Neurology service consulted for initial seizure presentation, recommend Levetiracetam 1500 [**Hospital1 **] indefinitely for seizure prevention.
#) Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for airway protection in setting of altered mental status, and underwent tracheostomy on [**2124-9-22**] due to persistent altered mental status.
#) Hemoptysis: Patient had episodes of significant hemoptysis and blood around her trach site.
CTA was negative for fistula.
No further bleeding noted.
Repeat bronchoscopy after latest episode of hemoptysis on [**10-5**] found a bleeding lesion in the trachea, which was coagulated with good hemostasis.
Since then, there have been no repeat episodes and her hematocrit and respiratory status have remained largely stable.
#) Pancytopenia: Pt was pancytopenic on admission and remained so throughout hospital stay.
Pt admitted on prednisone and imuran for autoimmunie hepatitis, initially immunosuppressants thought to be culprits, but were held throughout admission without resolution of pancytopenia; other possibilities included stress of acute infection, viral process.
TPMT returned positive, consistent with heterozyogous state, which suggests increased risk of myelosuppression with Imuran treatment.
Her elevated INR had been felt to be secondary to nutritional deficiencies and liver disease.
#) Elevated LFTs: On admission her LFTs were essentially normal.
During her stay had an elevation most notable in alk phos as well as a mild elevation in transaminases which are again trending down.
RUQ ultrasound consistent with liver disease, no other concerning pathology (no ductal dilation or gall bladder abnormalities noted).
There was concern that her autoimmune hepatitis could be returning, but the team was hesitant to start her on any immunosupressive therapies given the severe comorbid infection in this patient.
Hepatology recommended a MRCP, which showed findings c/w cirrhosis, as well as some ascites.
Hepatology also recommended starting ursodiol, but no Imuran or prednisone given her acute infection.
#) Pt had acinetobacter growing in her sputum sample during ICU stay.
Decision made not to treat due to abscence of clinical disease.
As above pt tolerated vent and 02 weaning without addition of antibiotics.
#) During initial decompensated illness, there was concern for systemic fungal infection.
Currently it is thought that this may have been a false positive in setting of listeria infection or possibly her ampicillin.
Various causes were considered including medication effects from Gentamycin or Keppra.
A TTKG calculated [**10-12**] was 10.33, which was inconsistent with the measured hypokalemia and suggestive of renal losses.
She is at risk to develop renal failure due to cumulative gent dosing, her renal function should be monitored closely for this reason and to prevent developmement of hyperkalemia in face of aggressive repletion.
#) ENT - ENT service was consulted when pt developed partial vocal cord paralysis after extubation and trach decannulation seen by laryngoscope.
The ENT team recommends [**Hospital1 **] PPI to prevent any GERD associated laryngeal edema complicating her recovery and follow up with their service in [**12-22**] months.
On day of discharge [**Known firstname 12705**] vital signs are stable, she has no oxygen requirement.
Her dense right sided hemiplegia has improved markedly since presentation and she is now able to move and grip with her right hand and wiggle her toes.
She does have some persistent attention deficits and difficulty with complex tasks (see neurology consult note for full details of current functional neurologic status).
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet [**Month/Year (2) **]: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization [**Month/Year (2) **]: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
