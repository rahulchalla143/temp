She ruled in for NSTEMI with troponin peaking at 13ng/mL.
Cardiac cath showed severe two vessel coronary artery disease with a 90% lesion in a heavily calcified LAD and total occlusion on the right.
Additionally, she presented to the ED with new onset rapid atrial fibrillation, which was rate controlled with IV Diltiazem, digoxin and Lopressor.
Initial hematocrit was 30%, GI was consulted and recommended follow up as an outpatient following resolution of cardiac issues.

-No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the right atrium or the right atrial appendage.
-No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
-The coronary sinus is mildly dilated (diameter 1.1cm).
No bubbles/saline noted in CS during interrogation for persistent LSVC.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-50 %).
-There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
-The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe restriction of the posterior mitral valve leaflet.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae attached to the anterior mitral leaflet.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
-The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
-There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
-There is no pericardial effusion.
Prior to weaning from cpb, there was moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, which reduced to 1+ off bypass.
Two small jets of mitral regurgitation were seen.
The annuloplasty ring was well-seated without rocking and with only a small perivalvular leak.
Her lisinopril was stopped for creatinine elevation of 1.6 up from 1.1 on labs from outside hospital - noted for acute kidney injury on admission.
She was continued on heparin for atrial fibrillation, and continued on digoxin and diltiazem for rate management.
Then on [**2190-8-12**] she underwent transesophageal echocardiogram to evaluate valve and rule out any clot prior to cardioversion.
She underwent ultrasound that ruled out pseudo aneurysm and vascular surgery was consulted.
She did have drop in hct from admission at 32 down to 24.8 and was transfused with packed red blood cells, and responded appropriately.
She had post operative bleeding that was treated with blood products with improvement.
The morning of postoperative day one she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without complication.
She remained in the intensive care unit for monitoring and on post operative day two was restarted on amiodarone for preoperative atrial fibrillation and coumadin.
She is to be discharged to rehab on telemetry with history of preoperative atrial fibrillation as well as IV lasix with significant post operative residual edema.
