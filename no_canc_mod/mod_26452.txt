The patient was found cool and diaphoretic with BP 70/50 and HR 100.

Brief Hospital Course: 64yo M w/ PMHx of  ESRD on HD (MWF), chronic aspiration, seizure disorder, history of CVA with residual left-sided weakness and dysarthria, upper extremity DVT on coumadin, recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] with melena found to have gastritis with no active bleeding lesions and Staph epidermidis bacteremia s/p IV vanc treatment [**7-20**], who was admitted to the ICU for hypotension.
He denies chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, n/v.
# Hypotension: Patient underwent HD on day of admission; it is likely that the patient's hypotension is related fluid shifts during HD.
Patient was initially with SBPs in the 70s upon presentation to the ED and improved to 100s with 1L of fluid and some pressors in the ED.
He did have brief episodes of hypotension to the 80s systolic while in the ICU but required a total of only 750cc IVF while in the ICU.
No clear evidence of infection so antibiotics were NOT continued while in the ICU.
# ESRD on HD: M/W/F.
# Hyperkalemia:  Pt is normally on HD and has baseline K around 5.
EKG was checked and showed now acute changes.
Pt denied chest pain or palpitations, dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea.
# UE DVT: Patient w/ clot in AVF previously on coumadin which was held in light of anemia.
Decision was made by daugther not to continue coumadin in light of risk of bleeding per most recent PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 626**].
# Anemia: HCT 33 upon [**Name Initial (PRE) **], consistent with chronic anemia secondary to ESRD, patient's baseline HCT is in the low 30s.
# GERD: H. pylori negative.
