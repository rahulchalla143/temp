Admission Date:  [**2182-2-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2182-2-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2113-2-28**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Location (un) **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease and chronic atrial fibrillation who presented with a fall, contusion and fever.
The patient had an unwitnessed fall heard by Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 30420**] on [**2-9**], and was found on the floor alert, but mildly confused.
He is generally without complaints of pain but was noted to have poor p.o.
Today, he had a second unwitnessed but overheard fall, was alert but confused and complained of pain in his right hand.
The patient remained confused for hours and was thus brought to the Emergency Department.
In the Emergency Department, the patient was noted to be febrile to 100.7 F.; he complains of increasing right hand pain.
The patient has a small amount of pus at the bottom of his graft that was sent for a culture.
Diabetes mellitus.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2164**]; status post myocardial infarction in [**2173**] and [**2180**].
Congestive heart failure with a ejection fraction of 20%.
Atrial fibrillation.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Status post cerebrovascular accident.
Cardiovascular is regular rate with no murmurs.
Extremities with left graft with no bruits, no pulse in graft.
Left hand x-ray showed no osteo, no fractures.
Chest x-ray was positive for congestive heart failure and a retrocardiac opacity.
Graft ultrasound showed no fluid pockets, no flow, noncompressible.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had sepsis secondary to an infected AV graft.
The patient's AV graft was removed on [**2182-2-11**], and the patient was found to have both a clot and an infection at the AV graft site.
The patient was sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit after graft removal because of rising oxygen requirements.
Additionally, the patient's left hand film on [**2-11**] was negative for a fracture or osteomyelitis.
The patient had an MRI of his hand which was also negative for osteomyelitis but positive for cellulitis and a nonspecific fluid collection over the first and second digits.
The patient's OR graft tissue and blood cultures last on [**2-10**], were both showing Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.
The patient also had an MRI of his left shoulder which was negative for any osteomyelitis, however, imaging showed two peripheral lung nodules which led to a chest CT scan which showed multiple peripheral ill defined cavitary lesions concerning for septic emboli.
END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE ON HEMODIALYSIS:  The patient had his AV graft removed in the Operating Room on [**2-11**] secondary to infection and clot.
GENERALIZED TONIC/CLONIC SEIZURES:  The patient had one episode of a generalized tonic/clonic seizure in the setting of sepsis.
Neurologic and Infectious Disease both stated that his lumbar puncture was not suspicious for a meningitis.
A head CT scan was done with no acute lesion.
The patient was loaded with intravenous Dilantin in the Emergency Department and remained on Dilantin throughout the majority of his hospitalization; however, at the end of the hospitalization, the Dilantin was removed as Neurology recommended no need to continue Dilantin for seizures in the setting of sepsis.
The patient should not be given any Ativan, Haldol and morphine given his renal failure and increasing sedation when any of these medications are given for his agitation.
CARDIOVASCULAR / CORONARY:  The patient had coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft.
He had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in the Medical Intensive Care Unit with peak CKs of 184 and troponin T 0.21.
The patient was getting dialysis for weight control.
RHYTHM:  The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation on Amiodarone.
Per the patient's primary care physician the patient is not to be anti-coagulated due to the increased risk of bleeding and high risk of fall in this patient.
INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient was continued on a regular insulin sliding scale with fingersticks consistently below 180.
PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE AND FOOT INFECTIONS:  The patient had a necrotic appearing fourth toe during this hospitalization.
DERMATOLOGY:  The patient had multiple papule like lesions on his lower extremities.
Dermatology was consulted and biopsied these lower extremity lesions which were eventually consistent with Kyrle's Disease.
This disease is associated with end-stage renal disease.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient had a video swallowoing study during this hospitalization, which showed minimal aspiration.
ELEVATED LIVER FUNCTION TESTS:  The patient had a right upper quadrant tenderness on one day of his hospitalization with an elevated GGT of 179.
A right upper quadrant ultrasound was done which was consistent with cholelithiasis but no cholecystitis.
Infected arteriovenous graft status post removal.
End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
Generalized tonic/clonic seizure in the setting of sepsis.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft.
Chronic atrial fibrillation.
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
Atrial fibrillation.
