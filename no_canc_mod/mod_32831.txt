However, the waveforms demonstrate essentially no significant diastolic flow.
This is an abnormal finding, and can be seen with ATN among other etiologies.
There is no hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection.
Doppler evaluation is substantially limited due to portable technique and the patient's inability to breathhold.
Waveforms are abnormal, with essentially no diastolic flow noted.
However, there is a sharp systolic upstroke.
Prostate is diffusely enlarged measuring approximately 5.4 x 4.9 x 3.5 cm.
IMPRESSION: Examination limited due to inability to breathhold as well as portable technique.
However, allowing for this limitation, there is flow and sharp systolic upstroke in both renal arteries.
However, there is essentially no diastolic flow.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
Large vegetation on aortic valve.
MITRAL VALVE: No mass or vegetation on mitral valve.
Mild to moderate ([**12-20**]+) MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
No mass or vegetation on tricuspid valve.
Conclusions No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are complex (>4mm) mobile atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta to 42 cm from the incisors and simple plaque in the transverse arch .
There is a large ((1.9x0.5cm) vegetation on the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen without evidence of leaflet perforation or root abscess development.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly to moderately thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild to moderate ([**12-20**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No abscess is seen.
Mild to moderate MR is present.
MODERATE GROWTH.
ASPERGILLUS NIDULANS.
He was seen by the infectious disease service as well as the renal service, and vascular surgery.
