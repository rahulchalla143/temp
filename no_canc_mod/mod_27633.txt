EGD showed mild gastritis and no active bleeding.
Capsule endoscopy was also performed on [**2-13**] that showed a few mild erosions in the duodenum and proximal small bowel as well as a few nonbleeding redspots in the mid and distal small bowel.
Since discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] the patient reports that he has had dark stools but has not had any BRBPR.
On sunday night the patient developed a tightness in his abdomen which he describes as a knot.

CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2200-3-6**] 2:23 PM  CT ABD W&W/O C; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  Reason: source of GI bleeding.Please administer PO and IV contrast.C Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 56 year old man with congenital heart dz, s/p VSD repair, GI bleeding.
INDICATION: GI bleeding, query source, concern for small bowel source, CT enterography please.
There are technical limitations to this study since it appears that the patient was not administered the VoLumen and this limits the accuracy of this study.
FINDINGS:  CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST AND WITH LIMITED ORAL CONTRAST: Again there is evidence of median sternotomy and four-chamber cardiac dilatation consistent with a history of conigential cardiac disease.
There are essentially unchanged bilateral pleural effusions and associated compressive atelectasis.
The IVC and hepatic veins appear dilated but otherwise the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands and kidneys appear unremarkable.
Within the limitations of the study there is no evidence of a gross mass within the bowel or for extravasation of intravenous contrast into the bowel lumen.
A ventral defect previously seen has resolved with residual soft tissue being demonstrated.
There is no free fluid or free air within the abdomen or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST AND WITH LIMITED ORAL CONTRAST: No intravenous contrast is seen within the lumen of the pelvic loops of bowel though enteric contrast is seen in the rectosigmoid area.
There is no significant free fluid or free air or pelvic lymphadenopathy and the bladder and distal ureters appear normal.
There is an unchanged small fluid collection measuring 3.9 x 2.6 cm overlying the left common femoral (2, 111).
MUSCULOSKELETAL: Persistent severe thoracolumbar scoliosis but no suspicious lytic or blastic lesion.
Technically limited study without sufficient oral contrast; within these limitations no GI bleed is unambiguously defined and no gross mass is identified.
Enteric contrast is seen in the sigmoid rectum of unknown origin.
Essentially unchanged bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis.
Unchanged massive cardiomegaly with associated mege-pulmonary artery and a seroma overlying the left common femoral artery.
G/GJ/GI TUBE CHECK PORT  [**2200-3-8**] 1:07 PM  G/GJ/GI TUBE CHECK PORT  Reason: eval for correct placement of J-tube  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 56 year old man with J-tube that fell out today, was replaced at the bedside.
Injection of a J-tube was performed without a radiologist present and shows contrast in several loops of non-distended small bowel.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 y/o M with PMH congenital heart disease s/p VSD repair, PVR and MVR, CHF, DM, afib on coumadin and mult.
# Anemia/black stools: Has had extensive workup this month without discovering active bleeding source, including EGD, small bowel enteroscopy, capsule endoscopy and colonoscopy.
He did have some erosions in duodenum and small bowel which may be source of chronic slow bleed.
He never had a notable large bleed but hematocrit continuously drifted down slowly.
His bleeding is complicated by the need to keep him anticoagulated due to Afib and large atrial size.
At one point there was consideration of transfer to [**Hospital6 **] for double balloon enteroscopy, as repeat EGD was thought to be low yield as most of the erosions were not within reach.
However, he had some respiratory distress requiring placement on the ventilator and the GI team at [**Hospital1 2177**] recommended deferring the procedure at this time.
He is considered transfusion dependent at this time.
# Acute on chronic resp.
failure: Trached during admission in [**Month (only) 404**] for heart surgery due to difficulty weaning.
He was transferred to the MICU twice for respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation.
His first transfer was in the the setting of volume overload and mucous plugging which improved with treatment of the MRSA/stenotrophomonas in his sputum.
The second incident of respiratory failure was in the setting of getting high doses of IV ativan leading to likely respiratory depression.
He completed a 5 day course of Bactrim for Stenotrophomonas and completed a 7 day course of vanco.
# Acute renal failure: He was diuresed given volume overload affecting respiratory status.
After being diuresed for 3 days, he developed oliguria with urine microscopy consistent with ATN.
Diuresis has been held and can be restarted when needed for volume overload and creatinine allows.
In light of his chronic lower GI bleed, it was decided by the ICU team that his anticoagulation would be discontinued.
# Congenital heart disease: s/p recent surgery.
No CAD on cath in [**12-10**].
Cardiology was consulted for periop risk assessment given his history - feel no increased risk since no CAD on cath.
# Anxiety/depression: increased fluoxetine to 30.
# DM: Cont.

You were admitted to the hospital after you were found to have dark black stool.
You have had extensive workup for GI bleeding in the past and again this admission.
In addition you developed problems with your breathing that were related to a class of medications called benzodiazepines, as well as a likely pneumonia.
You also had an infection of your bloodstream that was treated with ciprofloxacin that you will have to take for a total of 14 days.
You will not be taking coumadin for your atrial fibrillation for now as you have had bleeding.
Please return to the hospital if you have bloody vomit, large amounts of blood in your stool, large drop in hematocrit at rehab, dizziness, low blood pressure, poor urine output, or any new symptoms that you are concerned about.
