Admission Date: [**2121-6-10**]        Discharge Date: [**2121-6-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2043-7-2**]        Sex:  F  Service:  CME   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77 year-old female with a past medical history of coronary artery disease status post right coronary artery stent ([**10-29**]), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, deep venous thrombosis, status post recent axillobifemoral bypass graft on [**2121-5-6**] who is transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] from [**Hospital3 **] with fever and arrhythmia.
The patient underwent a recent bypass surgery for blue toe syndrome and course was complicated by a polymicrobial groin site infection, which included methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus for which the patient was treated with one week of Vancomycin and two weeks of po Linezolid.
Her course is also complicated by complete heart block necessitating the placement of a DDD pacemaker, which was placed on the [**11-12**].
The patient returned to [**Hospital3 **] on the [**11-10**] with a one week history of shortness of breath, fatigue, fevers or chills, sweats and right sided chest pain.
At [**Location (un) **] she was found to have six out of six bottles that grew out coag positive staph aureus.
In addition, the patient was noted to have a rapid irregular heart rhythm that was thought to be rapid atrial fibrillation and was loaded with intravenous Amiodarone.
The [**Hospital 228**] [**Hospital3 **] course is also notable for a 2 unit packed red blood cell transfusion for a hematocrit of 24 in the setting of guaiac positive stools and an INR of greater then 8.0.  REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  Fatigue, malaise, chest pain centered around the pacemaker insertion as well as dyspnea on exertion, stable three pillow orthopnea and stable lower extremity edema.
The patient denies any paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or syncope.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post right coronary artery cypher stent on [**10/2120**] (one vessel disease).
Peripheral vascular disease status post axillobifemoral bypass graft [**2121-5-6**].
Diabetes mellitus complicated by neuropathy.
Pancytopenia (?
Acute pancreatitis [**3-/2121**], endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography demonstrated a common bile duct dilatation/stricture.
Cirrhosis noted incidentally on MR of [**2-27**].
The patient is hepatitis B and C seronegative.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease/hiatal hernia.
Anxiety/panic attacks.
Breast cancer status post left mastectomy.
Suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm that is 4.2 cm in size.
Intravenous heparin.
The patient is found lying flat in bed breathing comfortably in no acute distress, anicteric.
There are no sores or lesions in the oropharynx.
There is no jugular venous distension in the upright position.
The patient has an irregular rhythm with a grade 2 out of 6 holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex radiating to the axilla.
She has 1 plus pitting edema bilaterally.
She has 1 plus dorsalis pedis pulses and trace posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
There are no rashes noted and no stigmata of endocarditis appreciated on examination.
Cranial nerve examination is notable for moderate hearing loss, otherwise unremarkable.
Electrocardiogram demonstrates a paced rhythm with atrial premature complexes, left atrial abnormality, left bundle branch block with an intraventricular conduction delay.
Infectious disease:  As mentioned above the patient was    noted to have a high grade bacteremia from cultures drawn    at the [**Hospital3 **] prior to admission.
Surveillance    cultures following transfer continued to reveal high grade    bacteremia with 2 out of 4 bottles that were positive on    the 15th for gram positive cocci.
Given the discomfort around her    pacemaker site as well as fluctuance at the pacemaker    site, as well as her frequent arrhythmia the    Electrophysiology Service was consulted.
Subsequent ECG    on the [**5-11**] showed what was likely to be a wide    complex tachycardia with a left bundle branch block,    superior axis with AV dissociation consistent with    ventricular tachycardia.
She was subsequently noted to    have multiple prolonged runs of wide complex tachycardia    of 10 to 30 beats on telemetry.
Fluid was sent for studies and    revealed involvement with MRSA.
Out of concern for possible endocarditis given the combination of high grade MRSA bacteremia, likely infected pacer wire, which is present in the RV and RVOT as well as newly appreciated MR murmur, the patient underwent transesophageal echocardiogram, which did reveal mild to moderate mitral regurgitation as well as moderate mitral annular calcification.
An echogenic mass was seen at the base of the posterior mitral valve leaflet consistent with a calcified annulus, however, a vegetation in his region could not be fully excluded.
Given the history of groin infection that included involvement with MRSA shortly after the axillobifemoral graft was placed as well as the high grade MRSA bacteremia, the patient was taken for MR of the torso to ascertain whether the axillobifemoral graft might be infected.
The MRI revealed the graft is patent with patent proxima and distal anastomosis though with a large amount of fluid along entire extent of the graft that is up to 3 cm in transverse diameter in portions.
The fluid is contained within an enhancing capsule that is highly concerning for infectious involvement.
The patient also complained of low back pain and again given the history of high grade MRSA bacteremia the patient underwent MR of the L spine.
Although initially the MRI was concerning for L5 S1 facet joint septic arthritis and possible associated epidural abscess a subsequent review of the MRI with both neurosurgery and infectious disease consult as well as with radiology revealed a very low level of suspicion for either septic arthritis or epidural abscess.
Serial physical examinations were followed and there was no evidence of cord compression through the time of this dictation summary.
The patient has remained afebrile for several days prior to the end of the period covered by this dictation summary.
The patient has also had multiple episodes with diarrhea.
Arrythmia:  As mentioned above the patient was transferred    from the outside hospital with concern for possible rapid    atrial fibrillation.
It is felt that the    arrhythmia that was noted prior to transfer and just after    transfer were likely caused by this malfunctioning lead,    which stimulated a burst of wide complex tachycardia.
She    was noted to have frequent episodes of sinus beats    followed by blocked APCs.
After pauses caused by the    blocked APCs she was noted to have inappropriate QT    prolongation of up to over 600 milliseconds and on several    occasions underwent a Torsad like nonsustained ventricular    tachycardia of up to five beats.
Out of concern for reinfection of even a temporary    pacemaker wire the patient was maintained on telemetry    without reinsertion of pacing wire and remained    hemodynamically stable even during the short burst of    torsad like nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
She was noted to have    dynamic T wave changes on several ECGs, though remained    chest pain free throughout.
Of note the patient was noted    to have a positive troponin T on admission.
Congestive heart failure:  The patient was noted to have    significant pulmonary edema on physical examination on    admission.
Right sided visual loss:  The patient complained of    partial right sided visual defect several days into the    hospital course.
These visual defects were quite    concerning to the team for possible stigmata of    endocarditis.
The defects are further concerning as the    patient is maintained on anticoagulation for her bypass    graft and had an elevated INR of greater then 8 prior to    admission.
An MR of the head did not demonstrate any    evidence for septic emboli, although there was concern for    a small (.5 cm) subdural hematoma in the right occipital    region.
However, subsequent CT did not demonstrate any    intra or extracranial hemorrhage.
The hemorrhage was thought to be    unrelated to the MRSA infection and was felt to be self    limited.
Pancytopenia:  The patient was noted to have pancytopenia    on admission.
This had previously been attributed to a    possible adverse reaction to Nexium.
The patient does,    however, have a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease    as well as Barrett's esophagus and was maintained on an H2    blocker rather then Protonix or Nexium.
