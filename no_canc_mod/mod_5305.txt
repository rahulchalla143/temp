His anxiety was managed with seroquel.
His blood pressure medications were held and he was continued on a less agressive CIWA scale (10mg q2hrs) held for hypotension or sedation.

Upon transfer, the patient reported that he was very anxious and required 50mg of valium every 4 hours to avoid withdrawal.
