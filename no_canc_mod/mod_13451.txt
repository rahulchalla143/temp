The pregnancy was complicated by dichorionic, diamniotic twins with discordant growth.
The mother also had a history of cervical shortening.
The infants were born by elective cesarean section due to increasing concerns for discordant growth.
After delivery and stabilization, she was transferred to [**Hospital3 1810**] due to census issues at the [**Hospital1 69**] neonatal intensive care unit.
In addition, over the first week of life, there was renal insufficiency noted, with a serum creatinine of 2.3 on ODL #2, increasing to peak of 3.7 on DOL #5.
There was also  mild hyperkalemia with potassium rising to 6.4 and hyperphosphatemia with phophorous rising to 6.9.
Mild hypercalcemia was also noted, with calcium rising to 11.3.
Renal ultrasound on DOL #3 showed mild left hydronephrosis, mild right pelviectasis, and small bilateral renal cortical cysts.
The renal service at [**Hospital3 1810**] was consulted, and overall the etiology of the renal insufficiency was unclear but thought to be secondary to placental insufficiency, perhaps complicated by reflux.
The hyperphosphatemia and mild hypercalcemia required alterations of her enteral feeds from breast milk with HMF to breast milk with similac powder.
General - Non dysmorphic preterm infant in no distress.
Chest clear, equal breath sounds, no murmur.
Abdomen soft, nontender, no masses.
She had rare    episodes of apnea and bradycardia, but no apnea was noted for    more than one week prior to discharge.
Several brief    bradycardic episodes associated with discoordinated feedings    were also noted, but none required stimulation and none were    noted for over 24 hours at the time of discharge.
No murmurs were noted.
An ECHO was obtained on [**4-6**]    given the neurologic findings (see below), and that was    normal without evidence of structural disease.
FEN/RENAL:  [**Known lastname 61172**] maximum caloric intake was breast milk    fortified to 28 calories per ounce, initially with similac    powder and MCT oil; as mentioned above, [**Doctor Last Name **] powder was used    rather than HMF secondary to concerns for hypercalcemia and    hyperphosphatemia.
The elevated alk phos was thought to be    consistent with mild metabolic bone disease of prematurity,    complicated by renal insufficiency and lack of sufficient    supplemental calcium and phosphorous.
Laboratory    studies were monitored, with gradual decline in alk phos    noted, no elevations in calcium or phosphorous, and continued    improvement in renal function.
Periodic monitoring of    renal function and chemistries including calcium, phosphorous,    and alkaline phosphatase is recommended.
As previously noted, [**Known lastname **] is being    treated with amoxicillin for urinary tract infection    prophylaxis.
Follow-up head ultrasound on DOL #32,    [**4-3**], was notable for the unexpected finding of a large    cystic structure in the left parieto-occipital region, with an    additional small right subependymal bleed.
No hydrocephalus    was noted.
The cystic lesion was concerning for    periventricular leukomalacia, although location was unusual    and no other white matter injury was seen.
MRI on [**4-3**]    confirmed the large left cystic lesion without evidence of    other injury.
Other    possiblities were a benign tumor such as a dermoid cyst and a    porencephalic cyst reflecting evolution of a previous infarct.
Due to the possibility,    although unlikely, that lesion could have reflected evolution    of an old infarct, ECHO was obtained to assess for possible    right- to-left shunts, and this was normal without evidence of    ASD or VSD.
Of note, infant was noted to be mildly lethargic for 36 hours    after the MRI, but this was attributed to sedation given for    the study, and resolved without intervention.
Given stable nature of lesion and normal neurologic exam,    infant was deemed appropriate for discharge with suitable    follow- up.
Head circumference should be    followed weekly for now as screen for progressive enlargement    of the lesion or development of hydrocephalus.
Audiology - Hearing screening was performed with    automated auditory brainstem responses.
[**Known lastname **] was    observed in her car seat for 90 minutes without any    episodes of bradycardia or oxygen desaturation.
With chronic lung disease.
Before this age, and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out of home caregivers.
Left renal hydronephrosis, right renal pelviectasis.
Left cerebral pariet-occipital cyst, likely arachnoid cyst.
