Admission Date:  [**2185-4-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2185-4-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-9-13**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Latanoprost  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: HPI: The patient is an 82 year old man (unknown handedness) with a history of Parkinson's disease, hypercholesterolemia, and right hip fracture s/p fall [**2-2**] s/p ORIF who presents with altered mental status for whom neurology was consulted when head CT showed a right MCA infarct.
At 8:00 am, the patient wasn't able to take his medications due to difficulty swallowing and had a productive cough.
Over a 3 hour period, he became less responsive and wasn't talking as much, and had a low grade temp to 99.9 axillary so labs were ordered given concern for aspiration.
They did not notice any focalities or asymmetry.
Past Medical History: Parkinson's disease, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65301**] at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital Dementia Right hip fracture s/p fall and ORIF with trochanteric nail: admitted to [**Last Name (un) 1724**] [**Date range (1) 86884**] Hypercholesterolemia Bilateral shoulder fracture Glaucoma Impulse control disorder BPH Positive PPD Obsessive-compulsive personality trait Right 5th metacarpal fracture   Social History: He has been in the [**Hospital3 2558**] x2 months after a right hip fracture (and he has been weight bearing only over the past 2 days).
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM AT ADMISSION VS: temp 102.2, HR 101, bp 111/52, RR 32, SaO2 92% on NRB Genl: Eyes closed, NRB in place, does not open eyes to sternal rub HEENT: Sclerae anicteric, no conjunctival injection CV: Regular rate, Nl S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops Chest: Tachypnic, right basilar crackles, no wheezes or rhonchi  Abd: Increased BS, soft, NTND abdomen  Neurologic examination: Mental status: Eyes closed.
Does not show 2 fingers or his thumb on the right.
Motor/Sensation: Pill-rolling tremor of his right hand, worse with noxious stimulus.
No observed myoclonus.
Does not keep his bilateral arms or legs lifted against gravity.
CT Head ([**2185-4-4**]) IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with acute right MCA territory ischemic infarction with hyperdense thrombus in the right MCA.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
Extensive bilateral pulmonary embolus with resulting hypoperfusion/developing infarction at lung bases.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] was an 82 year old man (unknown handedness) with a history of Parkinson's disease, hypercholesterolemia, and right hip fracture s/p fall [**2-2**] s/p ORIF who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] with altered mental status and was found to have a right MCA infarct.
#Neuro - A non-contrast CT of the head done to evaluate altered mental status revealed a large infarct in the right Middle Cerebral Artery territory.
The stroke was thought to be secondary to a large embolic event, possibly in the context of prolonged immobilization and a patent foramen ovale.
However, these tests were not ultimately performed as goals of care were transitioned to comfort in the setting of a poor prognosis.
#Resp - On admission the patient was noted to be in significant respiratory distress, requiring a non-rebreather to maintain oxygen saturation.
He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for presumed pneumonia, and underwent a chest CT to evaluate for possible pulmonary embolism.
CT showed large multiple bilateral emboli.
However, given the large cerebral infarct, he would have been at significant risk for hemorrhagic conversion were he to undergo anticoagulation.
Since a filter would not address the significant clot burden or associated heart strain already present, it was not pursued.
#CV - On admission Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have an elevated troponin of 0.13, as well as signs of right heart strain on EKG.
This was thought to be secondary to the large pulmonary embolism.
