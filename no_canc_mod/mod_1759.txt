Admission Date:  [**2129-3-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-3-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2071-10-31**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Lisinopril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**] Chief Complaint: unsteadiness and Headache  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**3-18**]: Bedside External Ventricular Drain placement [**3-23**]: 3rd ventriculostomy   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 11950**] is a 56-year-old RH man with a PMH remarkable for recurrent neurocysticercosis involving his fourth ventricle (initially diagnosed in [**2114**]), s/p VP shunt placement *2 (last time 2 years ago), with secondary seizure disorder who p/w unsteadiness and headache.
His exam was basically reflecting a normal mental status and no focal deficits.
He had imaging in [**2128**] which revealed a new cyst;suggestive of recent exposure to and oral ingestion of T. solium eggs.
He has been nauseous without vomiting.
No diarrhea, no productive or dry cough.
Neurocysticercosis: *Diagnosed in [**2115**] with cyst in 4th ventricle, resected at [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital (path confirmed dx), reportedly received anti-parasite treatment *[**12-8**] at [**Hospital 1263**]  Hospital reportedly treated again (albendazole/prednisone); worsened dizziness at this time *[**2124**] multiple admits for severe HA: persistent lymphocytic pleocytosis and actually treated empirically for TB meningitis; ventriculitis vs trapped 4th ventricle on MRI *[**5-9**] VP shunt placed *[**8-9**] VP shunt revised 2.
Seizure disorder: [**3-13**] possible new seizure activity; Keppra initiated [**5-13**] 3.
Dyslipidemia 4.
Hypertension 5.
Low Back Pain  Social History: Immigrant from [**Country 3587**] to US in [**2112**]; He previously worked handling food, is not currently working.
He does not use tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
Accommodative paresis and pupils become mid-dilated and show light-near dissociation.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift.
Gait unsteady, wide based, slow cadence, short stride, unable to perform tandem gait.
There has been interval decrease in size of the right lateral ventricle, and no longer is seen transependymal migration of CSF or surrounding vasogenic edema.
There has been interval development of encephalomalacia surrounding the catheter tract via right frontal approach (2:19).
No site of hemorrhage or edema is identified.
Interval increase in size of left lateral ventricle and third ventricle with a non- dilated 4th ventricle.
No hemorrhage or site of edema.
However, a new left frontal approach ventriculostomy drain is in place, and there is apparent decrease in degree of dilation of the third ventricle, now measuring 12 mm (2:34).
There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, shift of midline structures, or evidence of major vascular territorial infarction.
There is expected pneumocephalus in the left frontal lobe at the site of ventriculostomy drain placement.
Continued evidence for non-communicating hydrocephalus, with dilated lateral and third ventricles and non-dilated fourth ventricle.
EEG [**3-19**]: negative for any abnormal signal.
Left frontal catheter has been removed, with expected pneumocephalus along the tract.
However, there is a new low-density fluid collection along the left frontal lobe that appears to cause some sulcal effacement in the left cerebral hemisphere.
Ventricular size has decreased compared to prior study.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 11950**] is a 56-year-old RH man with a PMH remarkable for recurrent neurocysticercosis involving his fourth ventricle (initially diagnosed in [**2114**]), s/p VP shunt placement *2 (last time 2 years ago), with secondary seizure disorder who p/w unsteadiness and headache.
He has been nauseous without vomiting.
Upon admission, an external ventricular drain was placed to alleviate the elevated pressure in his head.
The wound was clean, dry and intact.
Post-procedure head CT was also done, and without acute consequence from drain removal.
He did not tolerate the EVD removal and 24h later presented with a right partial 6th cranial nerve palsy (new onset).
His mental status was mildly depressed (oriented *3) but more drowsy and bradyphrenic.
An urgent CT scan w/o contrast evidenced increased hydrocephalus and severe dilatation of his 3rd ventricle.
On [**3-25**] the patient had a fever of 102.
He also had pain in the neck with mild stiffness of the neck.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital6 **] of [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: VP Shunt Failure Elevated Intracranial Pressure   Discharge Condition: Neurologically Stable.
Right partial 6th cranial nerve palsy.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
Please return to the office in [**7-15**] days(from your date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and a wound check.
