Per the patient, he was attempting to ambulate from the chair to the kitchen when he reports LOC and awakening on the floor.
When he awoke, he contact[**Name (NI) **] emergency services and was brought to [**Hospital **] Hospital where evaluation there showed a SAH on a CT of the head.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift.
Mild resting tremor in BUE.
There is a hematoma over the left temporal area that is decreasing in size.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage filling the cortical sulci within the right temporal, as well as right parietal lobes are noted.
Additionally, there is an approximately 4-mm extra-axial collection overlying the right cerebral convexity, which is predominantly hypodense in attenuation, and suggests a chronic subdural hematoma.
Prominence of the left frontal extra-axial CSF spaces may reflect underlying atrophy, rather than additional small left extra-axial hematoma.
Leftward shift of normally midline structures by approximately 3 mm is noted.
No major vascular territorial infarction is identified.
A rounded hypodensity in the region of the right inferior frontal lobe may reflect encephalomalacia from prior insult.
Partial opacification of the right frontal sinus is noted.
Osseous structures reveal no fracture.
A left frontal subgaleal hematoma is noted.
Right temporal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage, measuring 1.9 cm.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage within the right temporal and parietal cortical sulci.
Chronic right subdural hematoma.
Left frontal subgaleal hematoma.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2171-9-10**] FINDINGS: The previously noted right posterior temporal hemorrhagic contusion with mild surrounding edema is unchanged.
The predominantly temporal and parietal right subarachnoid hemorrhage is unchanged.
A small acute on chronic right subdural hematoma is also unchanged, without mass effect on the adjacent sulci.There is mild leftward shift of normally midline structures, not significantly changed allowing for differences in patient positioning.
No new hemorrhage is seen.
Again noted is a small focus of encephalomalacia in the inferior right frontal lobe, which could be posttraumatic.
The ventricles and sulcal spaces are prominent, consistent with moderate cerebral atrophy.
There is a stable left frontal subgaleal hematoma.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST [**2171-9-10**] FINDINGS: There is no fracture or subluxation.
There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling or other evidence of a paravertebral hematoma.
There is no evidence of a significant spinal canal stenosis.
There is multilevel facet arthropathy with narrowing of multiple neural foramina.
No fracture or malalignment.
Multilevel facet arthropathy with narrowing of multiple neural foramina.
Right mastoid air cell opacification.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.
EEG [**2171-9-12**] FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout most of the record, the background rhythm remained of low voltage and was slow, typically reaching a 5 Hz maximum during wakefulness.
ABNORMALITY #2: There were additional bursts of generalized mixed frequency slowing.
ABNORMALITY #3: There were several brief sharp waves with some following slowing in the right temporal region, maximal at the T4 electrode in the right temporal region.
No additional findings were evident at this time.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG in the waking and sleeping states due to the slow and disorganized background rhythm, bursts of generalized slowing, and infrequent right temporal sharp features.
The first two abnormalities signify a widespread encephalopathy affecting both  cortical and subcortical structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
The right temporal sharp features were of  uncertain significance but suggest an area of focal cortical hypersynchrony.
They do not establish a diagnosis of epilepsy.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the neurosurgery serivce, to the ICU for neurologic monitoring, following a fall sustained while at home resulting in closed head injury.
There was no fracture or malalignment and the collar was discontinued on [**9-11**].
A1C was 5.5 Carotid US showed bilateral stenosis <50%.
EEG showed widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures but no clear epileptiform activity.
On [**9-11**] he exhibited signs of sundowning and Seroquel was started.
