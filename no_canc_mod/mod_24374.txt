Admission Date:  [**2160-6-18**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-6-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2134-8-13**]             Sex:   F  Service: OBSTETRICS/GYNECOLOGY  Allergies: Morphine / Hydrocodone / Iodine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 87599**] Chief Complaint: dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: This is a 25 year old woman with a history of asthma and Ehrlers-Danlos syndrome and currently undergoing IVF treatment who presents as a transfer from [**Hospital6 33**] with acute onset shortness of breath.
She had ongoing abdominal pain since the Friday before and had been seen at [**Hospital6 33**] although it is not clear what happened there.
On the morning of admission she started feeling short of breath, cough, and pleuritic chest pain that radiated to her back.
Her shortness of breath got worse and so she called EMS.
When EMS arrived they administered an epi pen, nebulizers and magnesium given concern for an allergic reaction or asthma.
They also did a CT chest w/contrast to rule out a dissecting aortic aneurysm given her description of the pain.
An ABG at OSH showed a respiratory alkalosis.
She had an expiratory wheeze that was felt to be forced due to her tachypnia.
She noted that she had made minimal urine for the 24 hours prior to coming to ED.
A chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and bilateral pulmonary effusions.
No actual desats.
A FAST exam (modified because sitting up) but has some fluid in bilateral lower abdominal quadrants which was felt to be more than just physiologic.
On arrival to the MICU she was in visible respiratory distress breathing about 40 times per minute on a high flow face mask and complaining of ongoing chest and abdominal pain.

# Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome: Her acute dyspnea and pleural effusions are consistent with this diagnosis.
Given her Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, chest pain and the acute onset of these symptoms, she had a CTA which was negative for aortic dissection.
Given her symptoms and the evidence of a S1Q3T3 pattern on her admission EKG, a second CTA chest was obtained to look for PE which showed no evidence of PE.
Her ovarian hypersensitivity syndrome was managed conservatively with cabergoline and gentle IVF.
# Dyspnea: Patient was tachypneic to 60s on presentation, resolved with reassurance and pain control.
Likely large component of anxiety on top of pleural effusions and pulmonary edema.
She has an unclear possible history of thrombus.
LENIs were negative for DVT and as above, CTA chest negative for PE.
Echo showed very small pericardial effusion with no evidence of tamponade physiology.
She received ATC duonebs for mild wheezing.
# Concern for Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: Per discussion with OBGYN there is concern for abdominal compartment syndrome.
When she presented, her abdomen is slightly distended but soft with mild diffuse tenderness.
Her abdominal pain improved throughout her admission although she remained somewhat distended with known ascites given OHSS.
# Chest Pain: Pleuritic in nature, likely secondary to increased work of breathing.
No evidence of PNA on chest x-ray.
As above, no PE or aortic pathology on CTA chest.
# Hyperglycemia: FS 305, given steroids at OSH, no history of diabetes.
She was placed on standing albuterol and ipratropium nebs q6h given her respiratory symptoms at admission.
# Leukocytosis: Received steroids at OSH.
UA potentially consistent with UTI however asymptomatic so will await urine cultures and not treat empirically.

This manifested by pleural effusions causing shortness of breath and ascites causing abdominal distention.
Initally there was concern over a pulmonary embolism and you were on a heparin drip, but repeat studies were negative and this was discontinued.
You were treated with medications for asthma symptoms, which should be continued until you are re-evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Please call his office if you experience any of the symptoms listed below.
