By the time the patient arrived in the ED she had no complaints of chest pain.
CXR done and without pneumonia/pulm edema.
She was also in acute renal failure with K 6.4, Cr 4.0.
Patient had a similar presentation in [**9-14**] when she presented in a junctional rhythm and acute renal failure.
It was felt that she was pre-renal and once fluids were given her renal funtion improved.
The junctional rhythm was felt to be due to beta-blocker toxicity and also resolved.
HTN 3.
Hyperlipidemia 7. s/p cholecystectomy 8. s/p hysterectomy 9.
Chronic back pain 10.
Family History: Mother died at age 80yo - had CAD, DM Father passed away at age 89yo - had CAD  Physical Exam: Vitals: 96.4F  HR 55  112/60  RR 15  97% Bipap: 40%/[**11-13**] Gen:  sleeping, but arousable with bipap on, oriented x 3, morbidly obese, NAD HEENT: Pupils large, reactive to light bilaterally, OP clear, MM sl dry with dentures.
Neck: supple, RIJ cordis CV: distant S1, S2, regular rate Pulm: diffuse exp wheezes b/l - Anteriorly Abd: (+) BS, soft, obese, nontender, no rebound or guarding Ext: somewhat cool, well-perfused, 1+ pretibial edema b/l  Pertinent Results: EKG:  Junctional bradycardia, HR 46, Nl axis, RBBB .
No interstitial lines or pulmonary engorgement is identified.
No airspace opacities are present.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[**11-7**] Renal US: IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 year old female with h/o morbid obesity, COPD/asthma, diabetes mellitus, HTN, CAD s/p PTCA to distal LAD ([**2177-7-31**]) who presents to the ED with chest pain, SOB.
Cardiac: Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with junctional escape and hypotension.
She has a known history of LAD disease, s/p PTCA in [**7-15**], EF 60%.
Her troponins were slightly elevated with peak at 0.07, peak CK at 160.
BNP on admission was elevated at 3563.
She had an elevated CVP which was felt to be secondary to OSA.
CXR was clear without evidence of pulmonary edema and no clinical signs of CHF.
She developed pulmonary edema which responded to lasix.
A temporary pacer with screw-in lead was put in place by the EP service on [**11-6**] and the patient was transferred to the CCU.
A permanent pacemaker was considered, however, the patient began pacing on her own and a permanent pacemaker became unnecessary and the temporary screw lead was removed on [**11-10**].
The etiology of the patient's sick sinus and stunned atria was felt to be due to her hyperkalemia and acute renal failure.
A low dose beta blocker was restarted, however her ACE inhibitor was held and renal artery stenosis was ruled out with a normal renal US.
She was started on coumadin for atrial fibrillation and INR will be checked as an outpatient.
ARF: Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with acute renal failure with a creatinine of 4.5 (baseline 1.3).
A FeNa was calculated and found to be <1% and FeUrea 12.5%, both indicative of pre-renal renal failure, however possibly in setting of low cardiac output from bradycardia.
Electrolytes were checked frequently while the patient was in renal failure and fluids were given.
A renal ultrasound was performed which showed no hydronephrosis.
Her ace inhibitor was held, but will be restarted at first outpatient f/u visit as above.
Pulm:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with shortness of breath and wheezing which could was felt to be secondary to a COPD flare.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Family Services Association of Greater [**Location (un) 8973**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Bradycardia Acute renal failure Right heart failure with pulmonary htn DM HTN OSA- uses BiPAP at home Asthma- uses O2 at home CAD s/p LAD PTCA on [**7-15**]  Secondary: Restrictive lung disease on [**Name (NI) 96801**] [**Name (NI) **] pt unable to ambulate, uses wheelchair Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Stable.
The patient is chest pain free and taking PO.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a slow heart rate and renal failure.
You have been started on a new medication called coumadin for a heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
If you begin to experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, immediately.
