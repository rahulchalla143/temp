HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old white male with known coronary artery disease, CABG and [**Last Name (un) 1291**] in [**2177**], diabetes, hypertension, end stage renal disease status post renal transplant in [**2179**], who had excision of the left fifth met head on [**2181-10-25**] by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 52130**] of the podiatry service.
Cultures then grew two species of Enterococcus which were sensitive to ampicillin, penicillin, vancomycin and resistant to Levaquin.
Arterial noninvasives on [**2182-1-10**] showed significant bilateral tibial disease.
The patient denies claudication or rest pain.
ALLERGIES:  IV contrast causes renal failure.
Diabetes since the age of 45 with retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy.
End stage renal disease secondary to IV contrast.
Colon polyp which was excised in [**2177**] with no further colonoscopy.
Excision of left fifth met head with ulcer excision on [**2181-10-25**].
; gemfibrozil 600 mg b.i.d., Regranex ulcer wound care.
In general, he was an alert, cooperative, white male in no acute distress.
There were no carotid bruits or JVD.
Left forearm had an old AV fistula which had a thrill and a bruit.
Heart had regular rate and rhythm with a mechanical valve click in the aortic position.
There was mild edema, left greater than right.
Left foot had a lateral surgical site with ulcer which was shallow and dry with surrounding erythema.
EKG was sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, intraventricular conduction disturbance, no acute changes.
The patient underwent a thallium stress at an outside hospital on [**2181-6-11**] which showed no ischemic defects.
On [**2182-2-4**] the patient underwent arteriogram which showed diseased BK/[**Doctor Last Name **] and tibial/peroneal trunk, patent mildly diseased peroneal artery, reconstructed distal AT.
Preoperatively the patient ran high grade temperature with t-max of 102.
An echocardiogram was done to rule out potential intracardiac disease.
There was no obvious mass or vegetation seen.
EKG was without acute changes.
The patient did require overnight, because of low urinary output, a fluid bolus to maintain his urinary output.
MRI of the left foot showed no evidence of osteomyelitis.
On postoperative day two he still required fluid boluses for low urinary output.
CBC should be monitored at days 10 and 20 of his antibiotics to insure there are no bone marrow effects.
There was no active drainage.
Enterococcal foot infection status post debridement with resection of fifth met head.
Ischemic ulceration with SFA tibial disease status post angio status post left SFA to BP bypass with greater saphenous and basilic [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5703**] composite graft.
