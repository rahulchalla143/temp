Left anterior fascicular block.
Anterolateral T wave abnormalities are non-specific but cannot exclude myocardial ischemia.
Since the previous tracing of [**2128-1-30**] further precordial T wave changes are now present.
It is difficult to entirely exclude an early developing pneumonia and clinical correlation is recommended.
There is likely a small pleural effusion on the right as well.
No signs of fluid overload.
Mild peribronchial opacification in the left lower lobe is comparable in appearance to [**3-2**] and could be either atelectasis or a very small focus of pneumonia.
Fullness in the upper mediastinum could be due to venous engorgement in the supine position.
Would recommend upright views when feasible for clarification.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is evident on the supine view.
There is resolution of the right lower lobe consolidation.
There is new small left pleural effusion with minimal atelectasis.
No focal consolidation is seen.
There is no pneumothorax.
No evidence of pneumonia in the right lower lobe.
New small left pleural effusion with linear atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 56 yo man with a h/o DM I with insulin autoantibody receptor syndrome, ESRD, PVD, chronic diastolic CHF (last echo [**7-5**]) who presented originally with DKA and clotted AV graft.
Also with history of extremely labile blood sugars.
His gap (initially 23) closed with normalization of his glucose and patient was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin with improvement in blood sugar control.
# AV graft thrombus: With stabilization of DKA, patient was taken to OR for RUE AV graft thrombectomy.
The venous anastamosis was successfully revised, which required repeat thrombectomy due to rethrombosis.
Was without chills, leukocytosis, or abdominal pain.
# Cognitive dysfunction and inability to care for self: Several team meeting held throughout hospital course with family, legal, case management, social work, and primary care physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) 15421**] [**Name11 (NameIs) 21030**] evaluation on [**2128-3-4**], reported that given patient's cognitive dysfunction, it would be best to have a guardian appointment for medical decision making (not just admitted to a nursing facility) given his processing difficulties and repeated problems with poor self care.
# Pneumonia: With radiographic suggestion of PNA on admission.
Patient was initially treated with vanco/zosyn for three days before antibiotics were stopped due to low suspicion given that patient remained afebrile, with no leukocytosis, or cough.
# Chronic diastolic CHF:  Patient was euvolemic on exam.
# Anemia: Stable.
