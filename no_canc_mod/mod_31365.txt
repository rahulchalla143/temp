CXR [**2-24**]:  Right diaphragmatic elevation with bibasilar atelectasis.
CXR [**2-25**]:  unchanged from prior CXR [**3-1**]:  Some right basilar atelectasis is demonstrated, but no definite new infiltrate is seen.
No evidence of acute inflammatory process within the abdomen or pelvis.
Status post total colectomy with right lower quadrant ileostomy.
LE USN: No evidence of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, bilaterally.
No evidence of cholecystitis or biliary dilatation.
No significant change from study performed three days prior, with no new acute inflammatory process within the abdomen or pelvis identified.
Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated segmental atelectasis, right greater than left.
Nodular appearance of left adrenal gland again not completely characterized on this CT. 4.
Unchanged small hypoattenuating lesion within the liver.
Tiny pulmonary nodule within the right lung.
abd XR:No evidence of obstruction or free intraperitoneal air.
Left basilar atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 58yo woman with end stage multiple sclerosis presenting with hypotension, tachycardia, fever, abdominal pain, and mental status change which was diagnosed as urosepsis who is s/p MICU stay, now on meropenem.
Fever, hypotension, and MS change: The patient's fever, hypotension, and MS change were thought to be secondary to urosepsis given her + UA.
She had an elevated lactate on admission and quickly became hypotensive.
She was transferred to the MICU, fluid resuscitated, and continued on levofloxacin/vancomycin/metronidazole which was then changed to Aztreonam given her allergy history when her UA came back positive for proteus.
A CXR was obtained and was concerning for pneumonia vs atelectasis.
However, given no h/o cough, sputum production, chest pain, or SOB, or oxygen requirement, this finding was attributed to atelectasis.
The ddx also included adrenal insufficiency since patient likely treated with steroids for MS flares, and autonomic disregulation given h/o central neurologic degenerative disease.
She remained afebrile for > 48 hrs and vanco was discontinued.
She remained afebrile for an additional 48 hrs and the patient was deemed well enough to be discharged on an additional 7 day course of IV meropenem.
Tachycardia:  the patient remianed in sinus tachycardia througout the duration of her hospitalization.
Given the patients abd pain, pain seemed a plausible etiology.
LENIs were obtained which were neg for PE and the pt did not have an O2 requirement.
Her tachycardia improved during the duration of her hospitalization.
Abd pain:  The patient complained of persistent abdominal pain throughout the course of her hospitalization.
She had two CT of abd/pelvis which were negative for obstruction, colitis, pancreatitis, or abcess.
She was also started on Reglan with the thought that gastric motility may have been affected, causing her abdominal pain and nausea.
Also, the epigastric location of her pain makes PUD a possible etiology.
Her PPI was increased to [**Hospital1 **] and her abdominal pain resolved despite continued TTP upon exam.
Discharge Instructions: Please return to the ER or call your PCP if you experience increasing temperatures, change in mental status, or any other symptoms that are of concern.
