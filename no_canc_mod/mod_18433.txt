Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Left open aortofemoral limb thrombectomy with abdominal aortogram, left lower extremity four compartment fasciotomies, bilateral aortoiliac Endograft, left superficial femoral artery thrombectomy.
History of Present Illness: The patient is a 79-year-old male who presented acutely to [**Hospital6 3105**] with sudden onset of back pain after bending over associated with intense weakness, numbness and pain of the left lower extremity.
Non- contrast CT at [**Hospital6 3105**] demonstrated an aortic dilatation at the infrarenal aorta.
Upon presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] the patient was found to have an acutely threatened left leg, reason for which he underwent a CTA of the abdomen and pelvis and lower extremities which demonstrated presence of an occluded aortofemoral limb on the left side as well as a pseudoaneurysm of the infrarenal aorta.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2187-12-11**] 4:49 PM  CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There are several scattered subcentimeter pulmonary nodules in both lungs, with the largest measuring 8.5 x 6.3 mm at the right lung base (image 99, series 3).
There is a dual-lumen pacemaker with the tip in the right atrium and right ventricle respectively.
There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.
There is no significant intrathoracic lymphadenopathy.
There is a 12 x 11 mm low-attenuation focus in the left lobe of the thyroid gland, a dedicated thyroid ultrasound for this would be helpful.
There is bilateral adrenal gland thickening.
The left kidney is atrophic and calcified in keeping with chronically infarcted left kidney.
The right kidney has multiple exophytic and intraparenchymal low attenuation foci likely representing cysts.
There is no significant upper abdominal lymphadenopathy.
CT PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There are multiple ventral abdominal hernias in the anterior abdominal wall.
There is no bowel obstruction.
There are surgical clips present in the sigmoid colon suggestive of a prior dissection.
The prostate gland measures 45 x 43 mm and contains multiple calcific foci within it.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  There are multilevel degenerative changes present in the spine.
There is some erosion of the body of L3 anteriorly, most likely by pulsations/pressure of the abdominal aortic aneurysm.
There is a 21 x 15 mm fat-containing subcutaneous focus over the right posterior lower neck, likely a sebaceous cyst.
There is mild-to-moderate narrowing of the spinal canal at the L3-L4 level and L4-L5 level secondary to thickening of the ligamentum flavum and disc disease.
CT ANGIOGRAM:  There is extensive atherosclerosis present in the coronary arteries, thoracic and abdominal aorta as well as the iliac arteries.
There is extensive ulcerated plaque present in the aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta and the abdominal aorta.
There is an occluded small left renal artery.
The left common femoral artery is aneurysmal at the site of the insertion of the graft with a soft tissue rind surrounding it and altogether measures 40 x 36 mm.
Aortoiliac endovascular graft post-surgical revision of the left iliac occlusion.
Type 1 endoleak with infrarenal abdominal aorta measuring 46 x 39 mm, previously 37 x 34 mm as described above.
Multiple pulmonary nodules with the largest measuring 8.5 x 6.3 mm.
These nodules may represent metastases if there is a known history of malignancy, particularly since the patient has had a prior sigmoid colon resection.
Standard followup is three months for known malignancy or six-month otherwise.
Atrophic left kidney with multiple hypodensities in the right kidney likely represent cysts, however, a dedicated renal ultrasound would help characterize further.
Bilateral adrenal gland thickening likely represent ademonas.
A 11 x 12 mm cystic focus in the left lobe of the thyroid gland should be assessed further with a thyroid ultrasound.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 75999**],[**Known firstname 1569**] E. [**Numeric Identifier 76000**] was admitted on [**2187-12-5**] with Acute left lower extremity ischemia with occluded aortofemoral graft limb.
He agreed to have an elective surgery.
He underwent a Left open aortofemoral limb thrombectomy with abdominal aortogram, left lower extremity four compartment fasciotomies, bilateral aortoiliac Endograft, left superficial femoral artery thrombectomy.
He tolerated the procedure well without any difficulty or complication.
On the floor, he remained hemodynamically stable with his pain controlled.
He continues to make steady progress without any incidents.
He was discharged home with VNA  To note pt did have some oozing from his fasciotomy site.
Pt also has residual psuedoanuerysm.
Pt will probably have endovascular repair in the future if amendable.

You make take Tylenol or prescribed pain medications for any post procedure pain or discomfort  What to expect when you go home: It is normal to have slight swelling of the legs: ??????
Elevate your leg above the level of your heart (use [**3-10**] pillows or a recliner) every 2-3 hours throughout the day and at night ??????
Avoid prolonged periods of standing or sitting without your legs elevated ??????
Your incision may be left uncovered, unless you have small amounts of drainage from the wound, then place a dry dressing or band aid over the area that is draining, as needed ??????
Numbness, coldness or pain in lower extremities ??????
New or increased drainage from incision or white, yellow or green drainage from incisions ??????
Bleeding from groin puncture site  SUDDEN, SEVERE BLEEDING OR SWELLING (Groin puncture site) ??????
VNA will be helping you with dressing changes daily.
If you notice any new bleeding, swelling, loss of sensation in your foot, then you should call the clinic or the ER immediately.
