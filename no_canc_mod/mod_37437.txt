Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Likely recurrent lung cancer.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 87-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and small cell lung cancer, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and others who presents with complaints of right-sided pain under the right breast times several days.
The patient stated she has never had pain like this before.
She has had no relief from Tylenol, and the pain has become worse with touching and breathing.
She feels her breathing is near normal but does feel sightly increased shortness of breath because of the pain.
She presented to the Emergency [**Hospital1 **] where the patient was found to be tachypneic and short of breath.
A CT angiogram was performed for a question of pulmonary embolus.
This revealed no pulmonary embolus but revealed a mass in the right upper lobe of the lung.
Small cell lung cancer in the right upper lobe, status post resection.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, on home oxygen; baseline of 94% on 2.5 liters.
History of BiPAP and Medical Intensive Care Unit admissions.
Status post cerebrovascular accident.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Head, ears, nose, eyes and throat revealed right surgical pupil.
Neck revealed no jugular venous distention was appreciated.
Chest revealed bilateral wheezes, dry crackles, and very coarse sounds, minimal air movement, reproducible pain in the right breast with palpations.
Extremities revealed no clubbing or cyanosis.
No Homans sign, and trace edema in bilateral shins.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray revealed no pneumonia; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and osteopenia.
PULMONARY/CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE:  The patient was maintained on intravenous Solu-Medrol 80 mg intravenously q.8h.
On the first morning following admission, the patient was started on continuous nebulizers as she was having very little air movement.
While in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient showed improvement with decreased oxygen flow with improved oxygen saturations and arterial blood gas when oxygen saturation was maintained at 92% and not higher.
She was seen by the Physical Therapy Service but was unable to exert herself at all without causing severe pain and desaturations.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  For likely pneumonia or tracheobronchitis leading to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, the patient's pneumonia was treated with Levaquin 250 mg p.o.
The patient did have a sputum culture which revealed Acinetobacter sensitive to Levaquin.
Her Persantine was initially continued, but following the Intensive Care Unit admission this was changed to Plavix as Persantine can exacerbate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
NEUROLOGY:  For her history of seizure disorder, the patient was continued on Dilantin.
ONCOLOGY:  For the patient right upper lobe mass found on CT angiogram, this was felt to most likely be a recurrence of the patient's lung cancer which had [**Doctor First Name **] resected in the past.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:  For ongoing right-sided chest pain, the patient pain remained reproducible and controlled with Tylenol and morphine.
Possible etiologies included osteopenia, osteoporosis, rib fracture, or metastatic disease.
DISPOSITION:  The patient's family and house staff had ongoing discussions with the family throughout the course of the admission about the patient's progress, and prognosis, and pain management.
She also elected not to undergo further arterial blood gases and reported that she would not want to be transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for BiPAP or noninvasive ventilation.
The patient's hematocrit remained stable during the admission, and it was felt that the patient would not be a candidate for any diagnostic procedures for this, and given that the hematocrit remained stable throughout the admission, no such diagnostic procedures were performed.
