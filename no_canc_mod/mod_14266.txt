He came home and started doing push-ups and also complained of left arm pain.
A short while later the wife heard a loud thump.
He was taken to an outside hospital, noted to be unresponsive and to have decerebrate posture.
His EKG at that outside hospital was found to have ST elevations on EKG in leads 2, 3 and aVF.
His right coronary artery had a very distal 90% narrowing.
Patient had no jugular venous distention.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops were appreciated.

He had a CT of the neck that showed no evidence of a fracture.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Vital signs on the morning after admission: He was afebrile with a temperature of 98.6.
Neurology was consulted because of continued decerebrate posturing.
His loss of arousability was thought to be due to anoxic brain injury from his cardiac arrest.
He was started on Dilantin for a few days in case his posturing was due to seizures.
An EEG revealed generalized slowing but no epileptiform activity.
An MRI was ordered because of a right-sided facial droop and weakness that revealed an increased signal in the left thalamus internal capsule which may be artifact.

He also had coffee ground emesis on admission which resolved with proton pump inhibitor therapy.
