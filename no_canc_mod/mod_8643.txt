Admission Date:  [**2199-3-12**]       Discharge Date:  [**2199-3-14**]  Date of Birth:   [**2133-7-13**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Medicine Intensive Care Unit - Green Team  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Change in mental status.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65 year old man with past medical history notable for coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, Type 2 diabetes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who was found in a temporary residence at a local [**Company 3596**] by his attorney who found the patient in his own stool and urine in bed, conscious but disoriented.
The patient has not had any clear memory of any preceding symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, seizures, head trauma, chills, fever, melena or bright red blood per rectum.
Chest x-ray was negative for rib fractures.
Also he has a history of congestive heart failure with 10% ejection fraction.
Type 2 diabetes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, an supraventricular tachycardia, splenic hematoma status post inferior vena cava filter placement in [**2195**] secondary to a possible motor vehicle accident, status post motor vehicle accident with multiple rib fractures, prior cerebrovascular accidents and status post right hip arthroplasty, status post motor vehicle accident, also bilateral knee surgery.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Unclear, the patient is not aware of any family history of any diseases.
He was notable for dry tongue, poor dentition with possible bite injury of right upper lip and cheek, notable scleral jaundice but no jugulovenous distension and no adenopathy.
Heart was mildly tachycardiac on examination.
Lungs were notable for bibasilar crackles with the left greater than right.
There was no organomegaly.
Extremities were notable for 1+ pitting and lower extremity edema.
There was noted, however, asterixes and decreased pinprick sensation of both calves bilaterally anteriorly.
Chest x-rays were showing stable cardiomegaly with increased opacities of both lung bases, suggesting pneumonia.
No pleural effusions were present and pulmonary vasculature were unremarkable.
Right upper quadrant ultrasounds were performed to rule out, obstruction series, normal gallbladder, no cholecystitis, no observable biliary obstruction.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the missing Percocet and the empty bottle on the patient's bedside as well as the transaminases, the immediate concern was of acetaminophen toxicity secondary to Percocet overdose.
He was also empirically treated with antibiotics, in particular he was treated with Clindamycin, Levofloxacin to cover a community-acquired or aspiration pneumonia.
He had borderline positive CKMBs and troponins during his course.
He was started on Vitamin K, Potassium and acute renal failure was believed to be secondary to dehydration given his status and condition when found in his [**Company 3596**] room.
He was given boluses of 250 cc of normal saline, smaller boluses were given given the patient's known congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of approximately 10%.
However, during the second day of the patient's hospitalization he became increasingly tachypneic and less responsive.
This was believed to be possibly evidence of cardiogenic shock at which point the patient was electively intubated for impending respiratory failure.
Over the courses of the evening, the patient developed cardiac arrest.
A cuff blood pressure was unable to be obtained as well as wide complex bradycardia.
He went into ventricular fibrillation and was shocked at 200 joules and given 1 mg of Epinephrine, shocked subsequently at 360 joules with another mg of Epinephrine and 360 joules again with 1 mg of Epinephrine.
He was developed atrial fibrillation with wide complex.
Echocardiogram was obtained to rule out tamponade, there was no tamponade effusion or global akinesis.
At 3 AM despite maximum persistence the patient developed hypotension and heartrate to the 40s.
Vasopressin was discontinued with continuation of Levophed and addition of epinephrine.
In discussion with the team as well as consultation with the patient's daughter it was decided at that point to cease artificial ventilation.
