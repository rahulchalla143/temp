Carotid duplex was performed on [**2151-12-17**] which revealed no evidence of recurrent left internal carotid artery stenosis.
Preop chest x-ray revealed no acute cardiopulmonary disease, prominent interstitial markings suggesting possible mild fibrotic changes.
Preop EKG showed anterior T-wave changes and inferolateral infarct with age undetermined.
Cardiac echo performed on [**2151-12-17**] showed an ejection fraction of 45 to 50 percent, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, mildly enlarged LA, decreased global systolic function.
Cardiac catheterization performed on [**2152-1-11**] showed RCA stenosis 70 percent, PDA is 50 percent, LAD 75 percent, and her left circumflex 100 percent distally.
Stress MIBI in [**11/2151**] showed positive global ischemia at 2 minutes of mild to moderate reversible ischemia in left circumflex territory.
On postop day 1 patient was hemodynamically stable, although she still required Neo-Synephrine due to low pressures.
Hematocrit was slightly low at 23.7, white count was 9.6.
Discharge physical exam was as follows:  She is alert and oriented with no focal deficits.
