Admission Date:  [**2120-9-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-9-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2060-7-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Crestor / Lipitor / Ivp Dye, Iodine Containing / Zocor  Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**] Chief Complaint: Elective cardiac catheterization and subsequent right groin pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization and placement of two cypher stents in right coronary artery.
History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 98929**] is a 60 year-old female with a history of CAD (2-vessel disease with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 10157**] placed to RCA in [**5-17**]), diabetes and hyperlipidemia who presented for cardiac cath and is now being transferred to the CCU for monitoring after laceration of her right external iliac artery.
In [**2119-5-13**] the patient underwent cardiac catheterization for inferior ischemia on stress testing and exertional chest discomfort.
She was found to have a diffusely diseased RCA with a 50% ostial stenosis and serial 90% stenoses throughout.
Six days later the patient presented with recurrent symptoms.
Repeat angiography revealed widely patent RCA stents and a totally occluded R-PL with collaterals from the left.
FFR of the ostial lesion did not reveal this to be hemodynamically significant.
Angiography of the other vessels was notable for a 50% mid LAD and a 40% proximal Cx.
She describes one episode of chest discomfort that occurred after eating a meal.
She then took a nap and upon waking her symptoms had resolved.
She also describes noticing a decrease in activity tolerance with shortness of breath and fatigue with limited amounts of activity including climbing a flight of stairs or swimming.
At times these symptoms have been associated with chest discomfort.
She subsequently underwent stress testing and developed [**6-20**] chest pain and 1.5mm inferolateral ST depression with exercise.
Cardiolite imaging was notable for a dilated LV cavity at stress consistent with exercise associated LV dysfunction.
There were moderate inferior and inferolateral reversible defects.
On [**9-26**] cardiac cath showed an RCA with 80% ostial stenosis with a 70% in-stent restenosis.
Two small puntures were noted in the right external iliac artery which were sutured successfully.
Past Medical History: Cardiac Risk Factors: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia .
Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2119-6-1**] anatomy as follows: --LMCA: without flow limiting disease --LAD: mid 50% calcified LAD lesion --LCx: 40% stenosis before takeoff of the OM1 which was a moderate size vessel without flow limiting disease --RCA: stents were widely patent (three overlapping 2.5 mm Taxus  drug-eluting stents placed [**2119-5-26**]) --Acute marginal: TIMI 2 fast flow --R-PL totally obstructed at its origin, but had collaterals from the LAD.
--Ostial RCA calcified lesion of 60% was further investigated with RADI Pressurewire --FFR changed from 0.95 to 0.85 with maximal hyperemia using IV adenosine indicating a hemodynamically insignificant lesion.
Hyperlipidemia 2.
Diabetes mellitus 3.
Moderate bilateral carotid artery disease 4.
Intermittent back pain after a fall in [**2119**] 9.

There was no xanthalesma.
Her right showed mild erythema of the conjunctiva.
There was no thyromegaly; scars from her prior thyroidectomy were noted.
The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Examination of the heart revealed no thrills, lifts or palpable S3 or S4.
There was a early systolic murmur, best heard at the aortic site with no radiation.
There were no rubs, clicks or gallops.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness.
The abdomen was soft nontender and nondistended.
The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis, clubbing; there was mild edema.
The left carotid artery had a harsh bruit.
There were no abdominal or femoralbruits.
Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses: Right: DP and PT via doppler Left:  Carotid 2+  DP and PT via doppler  Pertinent Results: Coronary Cath ([**2120-9-26**]) COMMENTS: 1)  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed single vessel disease.
The LMCA showed mild diffuse disease without angiographic evidence of flow-limiting stenosis.
The LAD had mild luminal irregularities without flow-limiting stenosis.
The LCx had mild luminal irregularities without flow-limiting stenosis.
The RCA had an 80% ostial stenosis with a 70% in-stent restenosis.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI grade III flow in the 5.
R femoral/groin pain  and hypotension after sheath exchange resulting in hypotension and bradycardia.
Single vessel coronary artery disease.
Chest X-Ray ([**2120-9-26**]) IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process with appropriately positioned central venous catheter and no pneumothorax.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2119-5-27**] no significant diagnostic change.
