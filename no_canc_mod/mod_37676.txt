FINDINGS: Again noted are bilateral pneumothoraces, left greater than right, with a large amount of subcutaneous emphysema left greater than right.
There is increased opacity in the right mid lung laterally that is similar compared to the prior study.
There are small bilateral effusions.

Depressed LAA emptying velocity (<0.2m/s) No thrombus in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
The patient has runs of a supraventricular tachycardia.
Conclusions: Pre-Ablation: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
The right atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There appeared to be a very small left apical pneumothorax and therefore his left chest tube was removed on post-op day two.
He continued to do well but remained for evaluation of sq emphysema and apical pneumothorax.
Do not drive if you take pain medications.
Shower daily, let water flow over wounds, pat dry with a towel.
