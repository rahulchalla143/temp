There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with severe global hypokinesis.
Moderate right ventricular hypokinesis.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had no angiographically-apparent flow-limiting disease.
There was a subtotal occlusion of the mid RCA.
Resting hemodynamics revealed significantly elevated right and left sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of 23 mmHg and PCWP of 36 mmHg.
There was significant pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with a PASP of 61 mmHg.
There was mildly elevated systemic arterial hypertension with a central aortic pressure of 148/66 mmHg.
Successful PCI of the right coronary artery with a 2.5 x 12mm INTEGRITY OTW bare metal stent.
Final angiography revealed no residual in-stent stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.
Elevated left and right sided filling pressures.
Elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
Depressed cardiac output and cardiac index.
Brief Hospital Course: 84 y/o female admitted to [**Hospital1 **] for acutely worsening PND/DOE, stay complicated by acute onset chest pain with elevated TnI and chronic LBBB changes.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for potential PCI in the morning.
No arrhythmia, chest pain non-refractory, HD stable, unclear if CHF worsening.
In the cath lab, she was found to have three vessel CAD with with 70% stenosis of the mid-LAD, 80% stenosis of the ramus, and 99% occlusion of the mid LCx with 50% stenosis.
She had elevated right and left sided filling pressures with a RVEDP of 23 and PCWP of 36.
There was significant pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with a PASP of 61 mmHg.
# PUMP: Old Echo EF 35-40% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 **] notes, symptoms (PND, DOE) suggestive of systolic CHF decompensation.
Exam positive for crackles and decreased breathsounds b/l suggestive of overload.
An Echo on [**7-23**] showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with severe global hypokinesis (EF 20%).
Moderate right ventricular hypokinesis.
# Acute Resp Distress - requiring BiPAP at [**Hospital1 **], currently on NRB, multifactorial, decompensated sCHF with potentially PNA.
No h/o COPD/asthma or smoking.
WBC at [**Hospital1 **] 14.4 on admission, 10.4 on transfer, afebrile while at [**Hospital1 **], afebrile here.
On transfer she was on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for possible CAP which could not be excluded on CXR from OSH d/t severe pulmonary edema.
However, repeat CXR did not show focal consolidation and abx were discontinued.
# Atrial Fibrillation - she developed AF with RVR treated with Metoprolol IV.
# SIRS (WBC > 12, RR > 20)- PNA suggested on CXR at [**Hospital1 **], on ABX which were d/c when once diuresed and there was no evidence of focal lung consolidation.
In addition, she was afebrile and WBC was down trending on day of discharge.
# HTN - chronic, currently normotensive 120s-130s, HR 70s-90s, At home on lasix, verap, lisinopril.
Outpatient Lab Work Check Chem-7 and INR on Monday [**7-30**] with results to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10543**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4475**] Fax: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 29683**]  ICD9: 428   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 2255**] [**Name (NI) 2256**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure Non ST elevation myocardial infarction Acute on chronic kidney injury Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were transferred from [**Hospital3 **] after having a heart attack and trouble breathing.
You will need to weigh yourself every day in the morning and call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 71206**] if weight increases more than 3 pounds in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
You were started on warfarin (coumadin) to prevent a blood clot/stroke because of the atrial fibrillation.
You heart is now in a regular rhythm but you are still at risk for a stroke and for the atrial fibrillation to return.
Minor bleeding such as bleeding gums, bleeding hemmorrhoids or nosebleeds are common on warfarin.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10543**] if not notice your stool is black or red, you feel weak or dizzy or you have bruising that is getting worse.
