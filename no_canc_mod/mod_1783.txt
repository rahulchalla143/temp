PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for known coronary artery disease, known aortic stenosis which has been followed by serial echocardiography, most recent echocardiogram revealed severe aortic stenosis, 3+ mitral regurgitation and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35 to 40%.
The patient also has a history of moderate left ventricular dysfunction.
She has a history of admissions to the hospital for congestive heart failure.
She has a history of bronchitis, pneumonia in [**Month (only) 956**] this year.
Her electrocardiogram revealed an intravenous conduction delay with a left anterior hemiblock.
She is status post right hip fracture and has a history of a transient ischemic attack in the past.
ALLERGIES:  The patient states no known drug allergies.
This revealed left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 38 with pulmonary hypertension.
It also revealed significant two vessel coronary artery disease, critical aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area measured at 0.45.
The patient had some hemodynamic instability and clinically with a pulmonary edema.
Due to the history of peripheral vascular disease, it was not possible to place an intra-aortic balloon pump in the cardiac catheterization laboratory so she was taken somewhat urgently to the Operating Room by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**].
She also had an aortic valve replacement with a 21 mm Mosaic valve placed in the aortic position.
It was noted upon extubation that the patient was not moving her right arm or her right leg and that she was not able to speak.
It was felt that she had had a cerebrovascular accident and the patient the following morning, [**4-13**] was taken for computerized tomography scan of her head which revealed an acute infarction in the distribution of the left middle cerebral artery.
On postoperative day #4, [**2136-4-16**], the patient underwent a swallow evaluation to see that it was safe to feed the patient orally and she did well with good function for oral and pharyngeal swallow and ability for pureed food as well as nectar thick liquids.
Their recommendation was not to give the patient any water, juice or thin liquids at all, so that she would be safe to have pureed or nectar thick liquids to take by mouth.
Cardiac examination, irregular rhythm and atrial fibrillation.
Her INR is 1.8 and she will receive 1 mg of Coumadin today and follow up target INR of 2 to 2.5 for peripheral vascular disease and stroke prophylaxis.
for presumed tracheobronchitis with an elevated white blood cell count 6.
Saliva substitute as needed  DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient remains stable for a cardiac and pulmonary standpoint and is appropriate to return from the hospital to rehabilitation facility with the projected discharge date of [**2136-4-19**].
Aortic stenosis status post aortic valve replacement 2.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft 3.
Chronic atrial fibrillation 5.
Hypertension                                 [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], M.D.
