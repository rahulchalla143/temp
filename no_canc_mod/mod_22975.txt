The pregnancy was complicated by a twin gestation with probable twin-twin transfusion evident by oligohydramnios in 1 twin and polyhydramnios in another twin.
This resolved spontaneously in utero, but recurred on day of delivery, [**6-29**], when twin A was noted to have oligohydramnios and no fetal movement.
This twin A infant emerged on [**6-29**] with good tone and inconsistent respiratory effort and very pale appearance.
The infant had an anterior fontanelle open and flat, nondysmorphic, palate intact, neck and mouth normal, normocephalic and eyelids nonfused.
Initial chest exam was notable for moderate intercostal retractions and fair breath sounds bilaterally, coarse crackles noted in both lung fields.
The infant was pale with moderately decreased perfusion, regular rhythm and rate, femoral pulses normal, normal S1 and S2 no murmur appreciated.
Abdomen was soft, nontender with no organomegaly, no masses and bowel sounds active.
Due to persistent desaturation on day of life #1, the infant was changed to a high frequency oscillator with a maximum mean airway pressure of 14.
The infant continues with multiple spells, averaging about 10 times per day and is currently on caffeine with a current dose of caffeine citrate of 7.5 mg p.o.
This infant has also had intermittent tachypnea to a maximum of 70.
Cardiovascular: The infant did receive 1 normal saline bolus immediately after birth due to initial hypotension.
A murmur was appreciated on day of life #[**1-8**] and the infant was treated medically with 1 course of indomethacin.
No significant murmur has been appreciated since then except on day of life #21 when the infant was noted to have an intermittent murmur associated with anemia with a hematocrit of 25.
Caloric density was also slowly advanced and currently the infant is receiving PE30 with ProMod.
The infant also had hypochloremia and hyponatremia requiring sodium chloride supplementations.
Lines: The infant had a double lumen UV as well as an umbilical arterial line placed initially and a PICC line following which was discontinued on day of life #15.
Blood culture was no growth.
There is no recent hematocrit since that transfusion.
The infant also had thrombocytopenia with an initial platelet count of 89 and that decreased to 57 requiring 1 platelet transfusion.
Neurology: The infant did have several head ultrasound results.
However, repeat ultrasound on [**7-5**] results are available and this head ultrasound at 1 week of age was notable for periventricular echogenicities, as noted previously on [**2158-6-30**].
There is no evidence of extra-axial fluid collection and no hemorrhage.
These findings could be consistent with a normal variant versus ischemic changes.
A follow-up ultrasound was done on [**7-13**] that showed normal echogenicity of the periventricular white matter which is symmetric with no cystic change to suggest PVL.
There is no evidence of interventricular hemorrhage and no evidence of PVL.
Ophthalmology: Similarly, the infant has not had an initial ophthalmic exam yet and will need to be done prior to discharge home.
Immunizations Recommended: Synergist RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the following 3 criteria - i) born at less than 32 weeks; ii) born between 32 and 35 weeks with 2 of the following - day care during RSV season, a smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or school age siblings; or iii) infants with chronic lung disease.
Before this age (and for the first 24 months of the child's life), immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
Twin-twin transfusion syndrome with this twin being the    donor twin with anemia.
Respiratory distress syndrome.
Apnea of prematurity.
