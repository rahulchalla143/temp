Admission Date:  [**2107-2-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2107-3-11**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: facial droop, hemiparesis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation PEG tube placement Tracheostomy   History of Present Illness: 83yo woman with PMH significant for atrial fibrillation on coumadin, HTN, and DM who was in her USOH the morning of admission when she was noted by her husband to be somnolent with a facial droop and left sided weakness.
Past Medical History: hypertension diabetes atrial fibrillation  Social History: lives with husband  Family History: unknown  Physical Exam: On admission:  T 98.2; BP 182/117; P 86; RR 26; O2 sat 96%  General: lying in bed NAD HEENT: NCAT, moist mucous membranes Neck: supple, no carotid bruit Pulmonary: CTA b/l Cardiac: tachycardic, irreg irreg Abdomen: soft, nontender, non distended, normal bowel sounds Extremities: no c/c/e.
Fluent speech with no paraphasic or phonemic errors.
No pronator drift.
Minimal movement on left arm and leg.
RADIOLOGY: CT head - FINDINGS: There is a rounded area of hyperdensity within the right aspect of the pons consistent with acute hemorrhage which measures 1.5 x 1.6 cm.
There is some mass effect upon the right aspect of the fourth ventricle; however, it does remain patent.
No additional foci of hemorrhage are noted.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.
There are probable choroid cysts in the atria of both lateral ventricles.
Basal ganglia calcifications noted bilaterally.
There are confluent areas of hypodensity within the periventricular and subcortical white matter, which probably represent small vessel ischemic disease.
There is extensive calcification of the cavernous carotid arteries.
Incidental note is made of a small osteoma in the left frontal sinus.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with parenchymal hemorrhage in the right aspect of the pons as described above with mass effect upon the right aspect of the fourth ventricle, however, the fourth ventricle remains patent.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus at this time.
Increased interstitial markings bilaterally may be related to mild pulmonary edema or atypical pneumonia.
Head CT: Findings consistent with parenchymal hemorrhage in the right aspect of the pons as described above with mass effect upon the right aspect of the fourth ventricle, however, the fourth ventricle remains patent.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus at this time.
EKG: Atrial fibrillation with ventricular response, rate 85-90.
Generalized non-specific repolarization changes, cannot exclude possible inferior myocardial infarction.
MRI brain w/ or w/o contrast: Again noted is an acute hematoma in the right aspect of the pons involving the middle cerebellar peduncle with mass effect on the fourth ventricle which is displaced to the left.
On the gradient echo images, there are foci of punctate susceptibility dropout in bilateral cerebellum, bilateral temporal lobes, bilateral frontal lobes and basal ganglia/thalami.
These could be a sequela of remote hypertensive micro hemorrhage.
There is extensive small vessel ischemic sequela in the subcortical and periventricular white matter as well as the brainstem.
Following gadolinium administration, no convincing enhancement is noted within or surrounding the right pontine hematoma except for mild subtle enhancement along its margins.
No definite underlying lesions are noted.
There is a right frontal venous angioma.
IMPRESSION: Redemonstration of acute right pontine hemorrhage.
No definite underlying lesion is noted.
Head CT [**3-1**]: FINDINGS: As before, there is an intraparenchymal hemorrhage involving the right aspect of the pons posteriorly and extending into the mid brain as well as the right cerebellar hemisphere.
As before, there is mass effect with compression of the right aspect of the fourth ventricle.
However, there is still patency of the fourth ventricle.
There is edema noted within the mid brain.
As before, there are changes consistent with small vessel ischemic disease in the subcortical as well as periventricular white matter.
There is significant mucosal thickening involving the ethmoid air cells as well as the maxillary sinuses bilaterally.
This is new from the prior study, however, may be due to interval intubation.
head ct [**3-4**]: NONCONTRAST HEAD CT: The extent of hemorrhage and associated edema in the right midbrain, pons, and cerebellum is unchanged, with unchanged compression of the fourth ventricle and unchanged dilatation of the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles.
Hypodensity in the subcortical and periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres is also unchanged, consistent with microvascular ischemic disease.
There are no CT signs of an acute infarction.
There is fluid and mucosal thickening in the sphenoid sinus, not significantly changed.
Mucosal thickening in the maxillary and ethmoid air cells bilaterally is unchanged.
[**3-4**] kub: No evidence of small and large bowel dilatation is noted.
No free intraabdominal air is seen.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction is noted.
[**3-9**] echo: Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
[**3-10**] lateral decub xray: Bilateral decubitus radiographs demonstrate bilateral freely layering pleural effusions, small on the left and moderate on the right .
Small bilateral pleural effusions greater in the right side are stable.
There has been interval improvement of interstitial pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 83 yo woman w/ HTN, DM, atrial fibrillation on coumadin presented with acute onset mental status changes and hemiparesis.
Her admission exam was notable for ability to follow axial and appendicular commands, symmetric and reactive pupils, a hypotropic R eye, a conjugate gaze paralysis with difficulty crossing midline on rightward gaze, R UMN facial droop, and decreased left sided strength with L arm antigravity but ataxic, L leg anti-gravity and right arm purposeful and leg antigravity.
Her CT revealed a right pontine hemorrhage slightly involving the lower midbrain with compression of R 4th ventricle.
An MR brain without and with contrast showed foci of punctate susceptibility dropout on gradient echo in multiple bilateral territories including the brainstem suggestive of either microbleeds or cavernous angiomas, and in particular, a left frontal venous angioma.
No underlying mass was seen.
Repeat head CT showed associated edema in the midbrain, but her examination remained unchanged afterwards.
Exam was notable for mild catatonia, for which *** neuroleptic medications are to be avoided if possible.
Hypertension: Her blood pressure was controlled initially with a labetolol drip and PRN hydralazine for target SBP < 160, DBP < 105, and MAP < 130.
Atrial fibrillation: Patient with known history of atrial fibrillation, with occasional episodes of rapid ventricular response while in-house.
She initially required a diltiazem drip and then PRN metoprolol IV for rate control.
She was transitioned to PO metoprolol and diltiazem but remained with slightly elevated rates despite maximum doses of these medications.
At rehab and as an outpatient, she should have her atrial fibrillation followed because she will likely improve and may need a decrease in her nodal blocking agents (diltiazem and metoprolol) as she is on maximum doses.
Patient should follow-up with her cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further management of her atrial fibrillation.
Given elevated HR, she ruled out for myocardial infarction with negative cardiac enzymes x3 and remained on telemetry.
Respiratory support: Ms. [**Known lastname 72288**] was intubated due to increasing somnolence.
She was extubated on [**2-26**] however had increasing secretion and tachypnea and required re-intubation.
She was transitioned to trach mask on [**3-2**] without difficulty.
Fever: Patient with fever spike on hospital day [**4-7**].
CXR was significant for moderate pleural effusion, but in the absence of cough, leukocytosis, or fever, it was felt that these effusions were not pathologic and would improve with auto-diuresis.
She required 1 pack platelets for low platelet count (83,000) and additional 2U FFP for elevated INR 1.4.
Mild leaking was noted around PEG tube site; surgical team re-evaluated incision site and felt that area was within normal limits.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever > 100.0 or pain.
Artificial Tear with Lanolin 0.1-0.1 % Ointment [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Appl Ophthalmic PRN (as needed).
Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Suppository Rectal PRN (as needed) as needed for constipation.
Right pontine hemorrhage 2.
Urinary tract infection 3.
Diabetes 4.
Atrial fibrillation with RVR 5.
Hypertension   Discharge Condition: stable, afebrile, tolerating tube feeds   Discharge Instructions: 1.
The patient came in with weakness and was found to have a right sided pontine hemorrhage.
She also had a UTI and atrial fibrillation with a rapid rate.
Please notify your doctor for more weakness, bleeding, fevers, chills, cough, rash or any serious change in status.
Follow-up with Cardiology after rehab for management of your atrial fibrillation.
