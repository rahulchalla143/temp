Acute renal failure.
This was all felt to be due to pre-renal causes.
However, a renal tubular acidosis could have been part of the cause for why he was having such a big metabolic acidosis.
The gap is greater than 15 and likely secondary to uremia.
Also a non-anion gap metabolic likely due to bicarb loss from the colostomy.
The patient is a fall risk due to his co-morbidities and likely had weakness caused by all of the dehydration and fluid depletion.
He was ruled out for a cardiac event and it was felt that perhaps is MS-Contin or Viagra could be contributors.
He did not qualify for acute rehab care.
The patient turned occult blood positive.
GI recommended that the patient undergo a small bowel follow through to look for a mass lesion as the cause such as a lymphoma.
Renal failure.
Urinary tract infection.
