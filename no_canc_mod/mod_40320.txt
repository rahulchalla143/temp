+ LOC for 5-10 seconds; denies any urinary/stool incontinence, no shaking, no tongue biting.
Pt unsure if he felt flushed prior to the episode; just remembers feeling very short of breath.
A TTE was performed that by report revealed a medium-sized effusion with RV collapse.
Since his surgery, the patient reports having intermittent episodes of shortness of breath.
Just reports some chest tightness, pleuritic chest pain.
Denies any PND, has not noticed any increasing LE edema.
Reports using two pillows to sleep at night, but is able to lay flat without getting short of breath.
Denies any headaches, changes in vision, no chest pain, no palpitations, no n/v/d.
Reports constipation for three days, abdominal pain which he attributes to lovenox injections, no recent fevers/chills.
Chest pain free, breathing comfortably on room air.
Bedside echo showed small pericardial effusion without clear e/o RA/RV collapse though visualization of the RA and RV was difficult   Past Medical History: 1.

MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2152-12-2**]):    No MRSA isolated.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion with preferential fluid deposition along the anterolateral aspect of the left ventricle measuring up to 1.3 centimeters in greatest dimension.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
IMPRESSION: Small to moderate sized, echo dense pericardial effusion without echcardiographic evidence of pericardial tamponade.
Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Small bilateral pleural effusions persist.
Mild areas of atelectasis at the left lung bases.
The gas collection in the left lateral soft tissues has decreased in the interval.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion with preferential fluid deposition along the anterolateral aspect of the left ventricle measuring up to 1.3 centimeters in greatest dimension.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
IMPRESSION: Small to moderate sized, echo dense pericardial effusion without echcardiographic evidence of pericardial tamponade.
Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 62 y/o male with HTN, HLD, h/o AR and ascending aortic aneurysm s/p AVR c/b pericardial effusion s/p pericardiocentesis and pericardial window who presents with recurrent pericardial effusion without echocardiographic findings of tamponade physiology.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES: .
# Syncope/Recurrent Pericardial Effusion: Mr. [**Known lastname 90690**] was transferred from OSH for concern of pericardial tamponade after he experienced a syncopal event with an echo showing pericardial fluid.
He was found to be clinically stable on arrival without clinical evidence of tamponade.
He had an echo which demonstrated a significant amount of pericardial fluid but without echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
He also did not have any arrythmias on telemetry but was found to have borderline blood pressures with mild orthostatic symptoms.
Other labs and imaging were unrevealing for a cause of his syncopal event and repeat TTE did not show significant interval progression of his effusion.
It was determined that his pericardial effusion was not the cause of his syncopal event or intermittent shortness of breath and no further management of this issue was undertaken at this time.
His home lasix was discontinued as it was beleived that he was likely hypovolemic and that his event may have been caused by orthostatic hypotension.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES: .
Asending Aortic Aneurysm and AR s/p AVR (St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]): His admission INR of 2.9 (goal of 2.5-3.5).
# BPH: Stable.
He was instructed to take this medication at night given our concern for possible orthostatic hypotension.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -He will need continued close outpatient monitoring of his symptoms as he may develop tamponade in the future if his pericardial window malfunctions.
-Should he continue to have pre-syncopal or syncopal events, he will need another syncopal workup.
Tramadol 50 mg PO Q4H PRN pain (usually only takes dose before bed) 9.
You were admitted to the hospital because you had an episode of shortness of breath and then fell at an outside hospital.
When you got here, we also did an echocardiogram, and on our study, we did not think that you had a significant amount of fluid around your heart that would account for your shortness of breath.
