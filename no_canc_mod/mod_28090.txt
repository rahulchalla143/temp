ADDENDUM: Under the CT of chest, a transcription error says that the nodules in the lung may be followed up on ultrasound.
These nodules may also be associated with the recent trauma and may represent a focal hemorrhage.
CT CHEST FINDINGS: On the lung windows, there are bilateral pleural effusions, right more than left side with some associated atelectasis.
No significant pneumothorax noted.
Two brightly enhancing lesions are identified again in segment IV and in the caudate lobe measuring 8 mm and 17 mm respectively.
In the posterior aspect of the right hepatic lobe, again noted is a grade 3 hepatic laceration with some subcapsular hematoma.
Some free fluid is seen around the right kidney but the previously identified grade I laceration is not well identified on this study.
No significant retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Some mural calcification and intramural thrombus is noted in the aorta and the aorta measures 2.3 cm in transverse x 2.5 cm in AP diameter.
The right common iliac artery is ectatic and measures 19 mm in transverse x 16 mm in AP diameter.
Bony windows reveal right rib fractures of ribs seven, eight, nine, and ten.
A nondisplaced rib fracture of rib eight on the left is also identified.
Focal outpouching of the aorta just distal to the left subclavian artery which is probably confined by the expected location of the aortic wall and probably represents a small aneurysm with atherosclerotic ulceration.
The relationship to the aortic wall is a little unclear and the possibility of a small penetrating ulcer is entertained 2.
Grade 3 right hepatic laceration with some subcapsular hematoma.
Free fluid around the right kidney but no definite laceration identified.
Rib fractures bilaterally and right transverse process fractures noted.
resolving ptx  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 68 year old man small R ptx and rib fx REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: PLEASE DO UPRIGHT - PLEASE DO AT 1AM?
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-27**] at 8:34 p.m.  Borderline interstitial edema has developed.
There is no pneumothorax.
Right lower posterior rib fractures are barely visible, not appreciably changed in extent of displacement since previous study.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures, or major vascular territorial infarction.
Prominence of the sulci and ventricles is consistent with mild brain atrophy.
Hypodensity in the periventricular cerebral white matter is consistent with chronic microvascular infarction.
Mucosal thickening and sclerosis of the right maxillary sinus is suggestive of chronic sinusitis.
Mucosal thickening in the frontal and left maxillary sinuses is also noted.
There is a right frontal cutaneous defect.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Vascular Surgery was consulted due to a finding on chest CT imaging; a six mm focal outpouching of the aorta just distal to the left subclavian takeoff, most consistent with a penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer was noted.
The Acute Pain Service was consulted for pain management; his pain is currently being controlled with prn Dilaudid.
Physical and Occupational therapy were both consulted and have recommended short term rehab stay.
Social work was also consulted for coping and emotional support.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
You will need a CTA (CT Angio) of your chest and abdomen to monitor progression of your aortic anuerysm.
