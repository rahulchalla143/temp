He awoke with mild substernal chest pain.
At that time, he had a TTE which diagnosed aortic stenosis, and a cardiac catheterization which showed left main 95%, LAD 100%, distal LCX 65%, ostial 70% OM3, RCA 100% ostial, SVG-diag 100%, SVG- Lcx not documented, SVG-acute marginal 90% discrete lesion, and SVG-RCA 60%, patent LIMA to LAD .
In the ED, the patient's EKG showed ST elevations in III and aVF, depressions in I and aVL, TWI in V4-V6 consistent with prior and new atrial fibrillation.
The patient's labs were significant for elevation of cardiac enzymes of troponin to 0.18, but no elevation of CK or MB.
Past Medical History: Aortic Stenosis Coronary Artery Disease s/p Coronary artery bypass grafting x5 ([**2115**])(SVG-diag, SVG-Lcx, SVG-acute marginal, SVG-RCA, LIMA to LAD) Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia s/p spinal surgery  Social History: Lives in [**Location **] with wife.
Family History: Mother passed away at age 62 due to MI  Physical Exam: VS - T 97.7 HR 63 BP 125/63 RR 18 O2 100% on 2L Gen: WDWN middle aged male in NAD.

Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pertinent Results: [**2127-7-7**] Echo: Prebypass: Very poor image quality.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe hypokinesia of the anterior, anterospetal and septal walls.
Mild mitral regurgitation persists.
FINDINGS: Unchanged cardiomegaly without evidence of pulmonary edema.
There is an opacity in the right lower lobe at the site of prior chest tube, likely atelectasis.
There is no evidence of pneumonia.
Posterior fusion device in the lower cervical spine.
Unchanged cardiomegaly without evidence of pulmonary edema.
No evidence of pneumonia.

[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3891**]   Brief Hospital Course: As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 25597**] was admitted following syncopal event with chest pain.
Most recent echo showed severe aortic stenosis and was already scheduled for elective valve replacement on [**7-7**].
In ED there was new onset atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, rate controlled on beta blockers.
In addition, patient was in complete heart block (initially asystolic), continued to be V-paced post-op and was assessed for permanent pacemaker by EP.
Pacemaker was cancelled since patient's rhythm converted to atrial fibrillation on post-op day four.
