?s anomaly, atrial tachycardia and recently diagnosed atrial fibrillation.
Then, in [**2130-11-5**] he ad palpitations again and had another cardioversion, started on sotalol, but couldn't tolerate due to bradycardia and was referred in for PVI.
The rhythm appeared to be intermittent junctional bradycardia, thought to be due to sinus dysfunction post PVI.
CT abdomen/pelvis without evidence of RP bleed.
On review of systems, he denies deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Two left sided and a single, common right sided pulmonary vein with no evidence of anomalous pulmonary venous return or focal stenosis (dimensions listed above).
Dilated right atrium and right ventricle.
Less than 4-mm lung nodules, do not warrant further followup is the patient has no risk factor for malignancy.
Signs of small airway disease.
[**2130-12-21**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The septal insertion of the tricuspid valve is apically displaced, consistent with Ebstein's anomaly.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild Ebstein's anomaly with dilated right ventricle and moderate TR.
Normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic and moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
No pericardial effusion seen.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
Transitional lumbosacral anatomy.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted with difficult to control atrial fibrillation, s/p pulmonary vein isolation with post-operative bradycardia and hypotension.
Disp:*14 syringe* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Atrial fibrillation Ebstein's anomaly Dyslipidemia  Discharge Condition: VS: stable Groins: stable Labs: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital to undergo a pulmonary vein isolation procedure to treat atrial fibrillation.
You has a short period of low blood pressure and slow heart rate after the procedure.
Continue the Lovenox until your INR is between 2.0 and 3.0  Go to the emergency room or call your primary doctor if you experience fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, blood in your stool, or black stool.
