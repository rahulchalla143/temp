Severe polyhydramnios with a maximum AFI of 53.
Mild ventriculomegaly noted at 26 week ultrasound with    lateral ventricles measuring 11 mm.
A 29 week ultrasound    also showed mild ventriculomegaly with lateral ventricles    measuring 13 mm bilaterally and a prominent cavum septum    pellucidum.
An MRI on [**3-3**] which was at 29 weeks was    consistent with ultrasound report and frontal horns were    noted to be slightly squared in appearance.

RESPIRATORY: Patient was intubated and received 2 doses of    surfactant due to severe respiratory distress.

Because of the weight loss and polyuria a renal    consult was obtained.
A renal ultrasound was performed    which showed a dual collecting system but was otherwise    normal.

MEDICATIONS:  Patient is currently receiving no medications.
STATE NEWBORN SCREENING:  Initial newborn screen returned with an elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone and therefore screening was resent on day of this dictation.
