Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.
No focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax is seen.
Right hilar prominence is noted without other findings of overt edema, which may represent vascular crowding versus central vascular congestion.
No osseous abnormality is identified.
ERCP IMPRESSION: Right hilar prominence may represent crowding versus central vascular congestion.
If clinically feasible, consider PA and lateral views for more sensitive evaluation.
Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated her understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
The patient was administered moderate sedation.
There were no complications.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in partial opacification.
Full contrast opacification was not undertaken because of evidence of cholangitis.
