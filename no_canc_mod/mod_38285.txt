The LMCA had mild luminal irregularities but no angiographically apparent flow-limiting stenosis.
The LAD had a 30% stenosis at the origin and a subtotal occlusion of the mid-vessel with antegrade flow and retrograde filling via left-left collaterals.
The LCx had a large OM1 with a 70% stenosis and an OM2 branch with a 70% stenosis.
The RCA was a co-dominant vessel and was occluded in the proximal portion with no evident collateral flow.
Resting hemodynamics revealed significantly elevated filling pressures with equalization of RA, PCW, RVEDP, and LVEDP consistent with right ventricular infarction and "pseudo-constriction" pattern.
The mean RA was markedly elevated at 25mmHg, the PCW was moderately elevated at 25 mmHg, and the LVEDP was moderately elevated at 24mmHg.
The pulmonary artery pressure was mildly elevated (mean PA 27 mmHg).
Simultaneous LVEDP and PCW tracing revealed a respirophasic variation between early LV diastolic pressure and PCW pressure greater than 5 mmHg.
There was no gradient across the aortic valve on pullback of the catheter from the left ventricle.
Left ventriculography was deferred given renal dysfunction and need for PCI.
A 7F 30cc Rediguard intra-aortic balloon pump was placed via the left femoral artery with appropriate adjustment of timing for optimization of diastolic augmentation and systolic unloading.
Final angiography demonstrated a minimal residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
Severely elevated R and L sided filling pressures consistent with biventricular failure.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed with apical and distal septal akinesis/dyskinesis.
There was no intracardiac thrombus seen.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 94216**] is an 83 year old with woman with hyperglycemia and RV infarct STEMI, and ARF.
For her STEMI: risk factors include poorly controlled DM and hypertension.
A work up revealed that her increased LFTs were not secondary to hepatitis, but more likely from hepatic congestion.
For her NYHA class III heart failure and her low EF, she was also started on spironolactone in conjunction with lasix.
Her hemoglobin A1C was found to be >8, reflecting chronically poor control.
Ms. [**Known lastname 94216**] came in with acute renal failure.
Her baseline creatinine 0.9 was but her failure was thought to reflect a prerenal etiology but may be intrinsic secondary to use of celebrex.
Her FENA was consistent with a prerenal etiology.
It was thought that this reflected her new baseline and chronic renal insufficiency.
The etiologies for CRI would include her poorly controlled DM and hypertension.
Ms. [**Known lastname 94216**] has an oxygen requirement and had clear CXR.
It was thought that this represented heart failure, but because of her upcoming catheterization and her hyperglycemia, she was cautiously hydrated.
By the end of her hospitalization, her excess volume was diuresed and she appeared euvolemic, no longer requiring oxygen.
Prior to discharge, Ms. [**Known lastname 94216**] was immunized against pneumococcal pneumonia and seen by the physical therapy team.
Per the patient, she's never had any psychiatric hospitalizations, or used psychiatric medications.
She was easily oriented after these short periods of hallucinations and this was attributed to her age and ICU hospitalization.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: myocardial infarct diabetes mellitus   Discharge Condition: good  Discharge Instructions: Continue your new medications.
Be sure to call your physician if you are short of breath, can't walk, have chest pain, increased leg swelling, or feel nauseated or vomitting.
Let him know you've been vaccinated against pneumococcal pneumonia so you don't need another for 5 years.
