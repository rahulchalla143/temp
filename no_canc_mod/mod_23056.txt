There is a new drain placed via a right parietal burr hole, which terminates within the collection.
There is partial reexpansion of the right lateral and third ventricles, but the posterior left lateral ventricle remains dilated due to the persistent entrapment effect.
The mixed-density left subdural hematoma measuring up to 6 mm in maximal dimension is not significantly changed.
There is polypoid mucosal thickening in the lateral recess of the left sphenoid sinus, and mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses, which may be related to the presence of the endotracheal tube.
Large right subdural hematoma has decreased in size s/p evacuation, with partial improvement in mass effect as described above.
Stable small left subdural hematoma.
Head CT [**9-23**]: Patient is status post right craniotomy with associated post- surgical changes in the scalp and associated pneumocephalus.
It remains predominantly hypodense with more peripherally distributed hyperdense products layering in somewhat dependent position laterally.
There is partial improvement in leftward shift of midline structures and right subfalcine herniation.
There is minimal remaining right subfalcine herniation as demonstrated on 2:9.
There is partial re-expansion of the right lateral and third ventricles, but the posterior left lateral ventricle remains dilated due to persistent effect.
The small left subdural hematoma measuring up to 5 mm in maximal diameter, 2:17 has overall stable appearance compared to the prior study.
There is polypoid mucosal thickening in the lateral recess of the left sphenoid sinus and mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses, which may be related to presence of endotracheal tube.
Right subdural hematoma has decreased in size status post evacuation with partial improvement in mass effect as described above.
Stable small left subdural hematoma.

PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
