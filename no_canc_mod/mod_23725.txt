Admission Date:  [**2161-8-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-9-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-11-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Dilantin / Ancef  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**] Chief Complaint: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Coiling of left ACA aneurysm Right frontal EVD  History of Present Illness: 59 y/o F with history of HTN presents s/p syncopal episode at work.
Per co-workers, patient collapsed but was caught and placed on the floor, no trauma to head was witnessed.
Was seen to have HTN when arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] and placed on nicardipine gtt.
Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage involving the cerebral sulci, the Sylvian fissures and the interhemispheric fissure.
Effacement of the cerebral sulci from hemorrhage and some degree of cerebral edema.
Increased density in the interhemispheric fissure as well as the parafalcine sulci due to denser hemorrhage in that area.
Small saccular aneurysm arising from the distal portion of the A2 segment of the anterior cerebral artery.
Recommend interventional neuroradiology consult and conventional angiogram for appropriate management and detection of any other additional aneurysms.
Hemorrhage extending into the thecal sac; limited assessment of position of cerebellar tonsils.
Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage involving the cerebral sulci, the sylvian fissures and interhemispheric fissure, unchanged in distribution from prior study.
No evidence of new hemorrhage or infarction.
Interval placement of a right frontal approach ventricular catheter terminating in the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle, with no change in ventricular size.
Small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage in the occipital horns and fourth ventricle, unchanged from prior study.
[**2161-8-21**] Femoral (right) Ultrasound: IMPRESSION: Normal appearance of right common femoral artery and common femoral vein with no evidence of pseudoaneurysm.
[**2161-8-23**] CTA Head: HEAD CTA: The intracranial internal carotid and vertebral arteries, and their major branches, appear patent.
There is no evidence of caliber change in the anterior or posterior circulation to suggest vasospasm.
Decreased subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Redistribution of intraventricular hemorrhage without evidence of new hemorrhage.
Stable ventricular size without hydrocephalus.
No evidence of vasospasm.
Decrease in extent and density of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
No new hemorrhage.
Stable ventricular size without hydrocephalus.
This may indicate minimal but nonocclusive vasospasm, but may be related to procedure.
No pneumothorax is detected.
No CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion is identified.
Head CT shows removal of the right frontal ventricular drain without evidence of hydrocephalus.
No new hemorrhage.
CT angiography of the head demonstrates improvement in the caliber of the anterior cerebral arteries without evidence of vasospasm.
She had a CTA on [**8-23**] that showed no evidence of vasospasm.
The gram stain was negative and later final cultures showed no growth.
TCDs were obtained which showed no evidence of vasospasm.
Pt had mild elevations while awake to around 23-25 mmHg.
CTA on [**8-27**] revealed spasm in the A2, we elevated her blood pressure to 160-180 and started IVF.
On [**8-28**] LENIs were performed which revealed no evidence of a DVT.
Over the next 24 hours the patient remained neurologically stable without sustained elevation in ICPS and so her EVD was removed on [**8-29**].
CTA was performed after Drain removal which demonstrated improvement in vasospasm, no hemorrhage with stable ventricular size.
On [**8-30**], patient remained stable after EVD removal and she was closely monitored over the day for any changes in neuro exam.
