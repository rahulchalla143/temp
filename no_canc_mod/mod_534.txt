Admission Date:  [**2170-10-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2170-10-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2124-3-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine  Attending:[**Known firstname 30**] Chief Complaint: Hemoptysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal Intubation for Respiratory Arrest secondary to sedation   History of Present Illness: 46M h/o alcohol abuse, HCV [**3-9**] [**2141**] blood transfusion, GERD, admitted with self-reported hemoptysis and CP, also found to be alcohol intoxicated.
Pt had attended baseball game at which he drank about 12 beers.
At that time, pt also developed sudden onset L sided CP initiated and aggravated by breathing, accompanied by SOB.
Pt later reported that this pain had changed to the R side.
Pt noted no other additional symptoms.
# Studies: CXR demonstrated ground glass opacities # Clinical course: Afib + RVR (150s), spontaneous conversion without meds to sinus tach (100s).
ROS:  Pt states that he was in his USOH prior to this incident (+) Fatigue which pt attributes to longer hours at work (-) CP, SOB, cough, hemoptysis.

# Professional: Carpenter # Environmental exposures: Sawdust.
# Alcohol: Up to 12 beers 6 times weekly # Tobacco: Started chewing tobacco at 20y.
# Recreational drugs: Pt reported experimental marijuana in youth only.
PE Gen: Anxious, tremors HEENT: NCAT, no LAD, MMM, OP clear, CN II-XII intact CV: RRR, S1S2, no m/r/g Chest: CTAB, equal excursion, no costochondral tenderness, decreased inflow limited by splinting.

# BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2170-10-19**] 6:55 PM No evidence of DVT.
# CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2170-10-19**] 5:04 AM Diffuse air space process, most likely infectious,involving the right upper, middle and lower lobes.
Small mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes, likely reactive.
# CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2170-10-19**] 3:30 AM Diffuse patchy opacity involving the entire right lung.
No pulmonary embolus.
Mild interval improvement in right lung patchy consolidation and ground- glass opacity, possibly reflecting improving infectious or inflammatory process; aspiration and pulmonary hemorrhage are also considered.
3-mm left upper lobe pulmonary nodule.
If there is no known risk factor for pulmonary malignancy, this may be followed up in one year with chest CT. .
# ECG Study Date of [**2170-10-19**]  12:10:46 PM Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
ST-T wave abnormalities which are non-specific.
Compared to tracing #1 atrial fibrillation is new.
# ECG Study Date of [**2170-10-19**]  12:34:48 PM Sinus tachycardia with occasional atrial premature beats.
Compared to tracing #2 sinus rhythm has replaced atrial fibrillation.
# SPUTUM Procedure Date of [**2170-10-21**] NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Bacteria, squamous cells, and scattered pulmonary macrophages.
# Cytology Report BRONCHIAL WASHINGS Procedure Date of [**2170-10-24**] NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Reactive bronchial cells, abundant reactive pulmonary macrophages and inflammatory cells.
# CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2170-10-25**] 1:10 PM AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST: In comparison with films of [**2170-10-19**], the patient has taken a very poor inspiration, which most likely accounts for the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.
Although, the image is somewhat over-penetrated, there is no evidence of pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: 46M h/o alcohol abuse, HCV 2/2 blood transfusion, admitted with unwitnessed acute-onset hemoptysis and pleuritic CP.
# Hemoptysis: DDx included PE and infectious process given diffuse multilobar opacities in R lung on imaging.
--TB rule-out: Pt was placed in isolation pending TB rule-out based on reported history of hemoptysis.
Bronchoscopy was performed to assess lungs and airways, returned no bloody fluid, and found no masses.
--Aspiration PNA: Concern existed for possible aspiration PNA given pt's intoxication on presentation.
Levofloxacin was begun with goal 10 day course, which was later discontinued given possible suppressive effects on AFB.
--PE rule-out: Concern existed for possibe PE, based on elevated DDimer, pleuritic chest pain, and episode of atrial fibrillation which could have been chronic.
Initial CTA chest had poor contrast timing.
--Autoimmune lung disease: Given isolated R-sided findings, low suspicion existed for Wegener's or Goodpasture's, but ANCA and anti-GBM were submitted and, respectively, were negative or pending on discharge.
# Chest pain: Pt presented with pleuritic pain associated with coughing and deep breathing.
CE were negative and EKG demonstrated no ischemic changes.
# Alcohol: Pt had h/o unsuccessful detox, and presented with ethanol level of 291 on urine toxicology.
Pt was highly defensive when asked about his alcohol intake, attributing his drinking to normal pattern with watching TV or a sports game.
# Acute renal failure: Pt's Cr was noted to increase acutely from 1.0 to 2 in a 48-hour time period, returning to 0.8 (baseline) on transfer from the MICU.
Pt pulled out second IV, again claiming that it also had fallen out on its own.
Pt also observed to eat five [**Country 1073**] sandwiches after completing his dinner, although he stated to nursing that he did not have any dinner.
# AFib RVR: Pt experienced brief episode of AFib RVR in ED, although likely [**3-9**] anxiety and pain.
On the floor, pt had no subsequent incidents of PAF, and anticoagulation was deferred without evidence of thrombus or PE.
# Sedation leading to respiratory depression leading to MICU admission: Over the course of his hospitalization the patient has had an escalating pain medication requirement for right sided chest pain.
He was found by the nurse to be somnolent with a RR 8-10, from presumed overdose narcotics.
After consultation with the pain service, he was given 200 mcg narcan IM followed by repeat doses of IV narcan (total 0.88 mg) with good result.
The patient had a room air saturation of 96%, but he would have ongoing intermittent periods of apnea and would desaturate to 88%.
Acute Alcohol Intoxication.
Narcotic Dependence.
Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Please return to the ED with fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, or shortness of breath.
