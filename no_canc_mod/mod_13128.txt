She was admitted to the hospital and found to be in atrial fibrillation with periods of one to two seconds with no conduction.
She was given beta blocker and Digoxin, which were held and she had an episode of wide complex tachycardia.
This patient failed to wean off the vent three times for likely presumed congestive heart failure.
The patient was started on a dopamine drip with a systolic blood pressure increasing to the 90s and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for further management of this presumed heart failure.
Given that the patient was hypotensive and had an increased white blood cell count and a bandemia it was assumed that the hypotension was due to sepsis, presumed pneumonia possibly due to aspiration or secondary to mechanical ventilation.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction 15 years ago.
Anxiety disorder.
Congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation.
Sick sinus syndrome status post pacer placement VVI [**Company 1543**] pacer with a rate of 60.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No JVD or increased JVP.
Cardiovascular irregular heart rate.
A normal S2, S1 occluded by 3 out of 6 systolic murmur heard best in the axilla.
Pulmonary the patient was ventilated and had course breath sounds throughout.
Abdomen obese with normoactive bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended.
No appreciable hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities were without edema, cyanosis or clubbing.
Electrocardiogram on admission revealed atrial fibrillation, left axis deviation, left bundle branch block with occasional paced beats.
Echocardiogram at that time revealed an EF of 25 to 30% with 3+ mitral regurgitation and symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy.
There was complete opacification of the left lung with shift of the midline structures to the left signifying collapse.
There was also diffuse pulmonary edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was treated for septic shock with 15 plus liters of fluid and broad spectrum antibiotics.
All external lines and hardware with the exception of the VVI pacer were removed from the patient and the patient was started empirically on Vancomycin, Flagyl, Imipenem and Miconazole powder.
Regarding her cardiac function the CK elevation was in the sating of a high cardiac output due to likely sepsis.
The electrocardiogram with the baseline left bundle branch block and now pacer placement made it difficult to say whether or not the patient was in acute coronary syndrome.
Echocardiogram revealed that the ejection fraction was 20% with a hypokinetic septum and moderate symmetrical hypertrophy and 3+ mitral regurgitation.
The patient had a rhythm of chronic atrial fibrillation with a rate that varied between 60 and 100 beats per minute.
Renal, the patient had acute renal failure on admission likely secondary to hypotension and decreased perfusion.
The creatinine normalized down to a level of 0.6 on the day of discharge after aggressive hydration and treatment of the underlying causes of heart failure and sepsis.
The patient became tachycardic to the 130s and therefore the treatment regimen was switched to Levophed.
The patient received intravenous fluid boluses for low urine output.
A TTE at this time revealed an EF of 20 to 30% with 3+ mitral regurgitation and apical akinesis.
This achieved rate control in the 60s to 80s, but atrial fibrillation persisted.
The patient was weaned off of diuretics as the congestive heart failure and cardiogenic shock resolved and all of her intravenous medications were changed to po.
She was instructed to take all of her medications as described most importantly her Metoprolol 50 mg three times a day to control her heart rate and prevent flash pulmonary edema.
If her weights increase by 2 pounds she was instructed to call her cardiologist or primary care physician to evaluate whether or not her diuresis needs required modification.
Ativan .5 mg every four to six hours as needed for anxiety.
Levofloxacin 250 mg tablet once a day for three days for treatment of urinary tract infection.
It was determined that the patient had experienced multiple stressors of increased heart rate and hypertension and hypertensive urgency during her stay and did not have enzyme leaks.
She did not meet criteria for unstable angina or myocardial infarction.
