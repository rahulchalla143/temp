Admission Date:  [**2111-6-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2111-6-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2086-1-31**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Rocephin / Biaxin / Cipro  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**] Chief Complaint: finger ischemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: placement of subclavian central venous catheter debridement of finger ulcers: right 3rd digit and left 5th digit botox injections of bilateral hands  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 78910**] is a 25 yo F with a history of Raynaud's, SLE, and sjogren's who presents with digital ischemia and gangrene of her hands.
In [**Month (only) 956**] her Raynaud's started becoming symptomatic with more difficulty warming her hands especially in the pointer and middle finger.
Then she developed increasing pain in these digits as well as ulceration, ischemia, necrotic tissue, drainage, and purple fingers.
She came to the ED and was told her pain was due to reperfusion of digits and was given percocet.
She has hypotension and dizziness as a side effect of her procardia and thus takes it at night.
Pt reports a history of SVT and "erratic heart beats" after skipped beats.
She has received dilaudid for pain control but otherwise has received no antibiotics or other medications.
Ortho hand saw her and felt she had no acute issues and is not in need of antibiotics currently.
She denied tingling or weakness in the hands.
ROS + for increased sugars in the 400s at home.
+ for chronic chest pain substernal pressure radiating to the shoulders c/w her pain from lupus, + SOB in evening both at rest and on exertion, has not been able to lie flat for yr sdue to painful breathing.
+ fpr fluid retension after being given IVF in a hospital approximately 1 month ago in the setting of dehydration.
+ increase psychological stress in setting of chronic pain.
+ tachycardia to 100s yesterday and feeling of skipped beats earlier this week.
+ weight loss 50 lbs from [**Month (only) **]-[**Month (only) **] then weighed 100 now 116 lbs.
She states tachycardia usually resolved with bearing down.
Postural tachycardia syndrome 9.
Physical Exam: VS on the floor: 98.6 124/82 76 16 98RA GENERAL: ill appearing female, thin, appearing stated age, NAD HEENT: anicteric sclera, MMM, OP clear LUNGS: CTAB posteriorly CARDIO: RRR nl s1/s2 ABD: + BS, soft, NTND, no HSM EXT: distal cyanosis and mottleing of all distal digits of her hand.
Open nacrotic ulcer with oozing on medial and lateral aspect of the 3rd digit of the right hand.
Bibasilar atelectasis/infiltrates with small bilateral pleural effusions.
[**6-14**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia.
Non-specific inferolateral T wave flattening.
Poor R wave progression.
[**6-14**] CXR: The lung volumes are low with alveolar infiltrate and air bronchograms in both lower lungs.
Compared to the prior study, the volume loss and infiltrate in the lower lungs has increased.
[**2111-6-17**]   	Cardiology 	ECHO Small pericardial effusion was noted.
No tamponade physiology was seen.
[**2111-6-17**]   	Radiology 	CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECON No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion with lower lobe atelectasis.
[**2111-6-18**]   	Radiology 	CHEST (PA & LAT) IMPRESSION: Since prior examination, interval increase of atelectatic infiltrates involving the right base with otherwise no significant change in bilateral basilar infiltrates and bilateral loculated moderate pleural effusions.

Digital ischemia and pain improved during the infusion.
The patient underwent debridement (3rd digit of R hand and 5th digit of L hand) and botox injections of b/l hands on [**2111-6-16**] with no complications.
Pain was controlled with Gabapentin, home standing dose of Dilaudid, with IV Dilaudid for breakthrough.
Although her debrided fingers improved, especially after Salumedrol pulse of 500mg x 1 followed by 40mg PO daily, her R index finger necrosis developed and slightly worsened.
She was sent home on nifedipine 60mg PO HS, nitro paste topical, plavix 75 and aspirin 325 to minimize platelet clumping as a possible mechanism of ischemia.
Hypoxia/pleuritic chest pain: Pt with shortness of breath and low O2 sats on her fingers - higher on ear.
This was thought to be secondary to pleuro-pericarditis leading to splinting from pleuritic chest pain causing hypoventilation.
This hypoventilation was thought to be exacerbated by high doses of dilaudid in treating her severe chest pain.
A CTA was negative for PE and only showed basilar atelectasis and bilateral small to moderate pleural effusions.
Echo revealed small pericardial effusion but no tamponade physiology.
Sildanefil was thought to contribute by way of pulmonary shunting, however, when this was restarted briefly, there was no hypoxia noted even at full doses.
The patient's pleuritic chest pain and hypoxia completely resolved after 500mg solumedrol followed by 40mg PO daily.
Fever: Pt was febrile to 101 - pancultured with no identified source.
Vanc was started for cellulitis of the digits, given that the pt has a cephalosporin allergy.
The patient remained afebrile for the remainder of the hospitalization.
# Intermittent sinus tachycardia: The patient developed intermittent sinus tachycardia to the 130s-140s lasting for hours at times that was inkeeping with her past medical history.
Her exacerbations of tachycardia were thought to be secondary to severe pleuritic chest pain leading to anxiety as well as rapid shallow breathing (hypoventilation) then hypoxia.
The sinus tachycardia resolved again after the solumedrol pulse dosing.
However, she did maintain a resting heart rate of 90-100s, and she may simply have a baseline hyperactive sympethatic tone.
No further SVT was noted after the line was adjusted.
T1DM: Poorly controlled overall.
Sjogren's/SLE:  Anemia and weight loss are likely related to current flare of SLE.
# Stress/poor coping: Patient would benefit from outpatient social work referral.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Polyvinyl Alcohol-Povidone 1.4-0.6 % Dropperette Sig: [**1-24**] Drops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eye.
Nitroglycerin 2 % Ointment Sig: 0.5  Transdermal Daily, 12 hours on, 12 hours off: Apply to base of right index finger with gloved hand.
Please be especially careful in handling the paste as it can cause dangerously low blood pressures with any excessive physical contact.
You were admitted for worsening necrosis (tissue death) of your fingers due to your Lupus causing your [**Last Name (un) 8061**] to flare.
You will go home on nifedipine (Procardia) 60mg by mouth every night, nitro paste to apply on your finger, and plavix to prevent platelet clumping blocking blood flow.
Your low oxygen was thought to be secondary to inflammation and chest pain limiting adequate deep breathing.
By treating your Lupus with high-dose steroids, your inflammation and pain reduced so you could breath better.
The high dose steroids may have been the cause of your high blood pressures.
We have made the following changes to your medications: -STOP taking sildenafil -START taking clopidogrel (Plavix) 75mg by mouth daily -START taking oxycodone 80mg by mouth twice daily for 1 week or longer if necessary -START taking dilaudid 6mg by mouth every 3 hours as needed for pain -START taking nitro paste [**1-26**] inch to be placed with gloved hand at base of right index finger, 12 hours on and 12 hours off.
