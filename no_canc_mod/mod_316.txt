HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 86 year old female who has had recent multiple admissions to the hospital for shortness of breath who was admitted on [**2140-1-16**], from rehabilitation with listlessness and a blood pressure in the low range of 100/60.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3357**], assessed the patient and she was sent to [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Department for evaluation for congestive heart failure.
She was in the Intensive Care Unit for three hospital days and was transferred out to the Medicine floor after it was determined that she was likely dehydrated and went into renal failure due to dehydration and possible over diuresis.
Coronary artery disease, status post pacer for complete heart block.
Diabetes mellitus.
Congestive heart failure.
Bilateral knee arthroplasty.
The lungs show slight crackles at the left base and no audible wheezes.
Cardiovascular reveals a regular rate and rhythm with distant heart sounds.
It was determined by chest x-ray that she was dry and had possible infiltrate and was treated with antibiotics, Levofloxacin, Flagyl, Vancomycin.
The Vancomycin was discontinued, however, she remained on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for concern of aspiration pneumonia.
Of note, she has not had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma in the past.
Upon transfer to the Medicine floor, she was found the next day to be in significant respiratory distress requiring respirator care and nebulizers.
Chest x-ray was obtained and showed progressive heart failure over the past four days in the hospital.
She then became very lethargic and was given intravenous fluids as it is noted in the past the patient responds very well to intravenous fluids, becoming more alert and aware of her environment.
Also of note, the patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 55% and E:A ratio of 0.82, however, this did not meet criteria for diastolic dysfunction.
She also had a very poor quality echocardiogram which limited our evaluation of whether she has systolic dysfunction in addition to diastolic dysfunction.
A heart failure consultation was obtained by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and it was determined that it was difficult to tell whether she had pure diastolic dysfunction.
Hypotension - It was unclear whether the patient was overmedicated with blood pressure medications upon admission or was over-diuresed.
Coronary artery disease, status post pacer for complete heart block.
Diabetes mellitus.
Congestive heart failure.
Bilateral knee arthroplasty.
