Open treatment of extension-type fracture dislocation T8-     T9 and extension type dislocation fracture of T1-T2.
Posterior spinal instrumentation and fusion C6-T3.
Posterior spinal instrumentation and fusion T7-T10.
Application of allograft and local autograft.
He presented to local hospital with a fall during a seizure.
He has no recollection of the seizure himself.
At the local hospital a T1 pedicle fracture was found with no signs of facial or cranial fracture.
Despite the T1 fracture he had no C/T spinal tenderness or bruising and ortho at [**Hospital1 18**] cleared him for a TLSO brace.
Past Medical History: - Refractory seizures since age 7 years - VNS insertion in [**2164**] - Mentally challenged as per previous Neuropsych evaluation - cystic lesion Left temporal pole - Hyperlipidemia on statin - ?
Heart sounds were normal with no murmur; lungs were clear with equal air entry, abdomen was soft and non-tender, extremities were warm and pulses were palpable with no edema.
On cranial nerve exam visual fields were full, pupils were 1.5 mm equal and reactive to light, extraocular movements were full with no nystagmus, face sensation and movements were symmetric, there was no dysarthria and tongue was midline.
Strength was full throughout with no pronator drift.
Postural tremor noted 2+ R and 1+ in hands, trace asterixis in the hands.
There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
There is no aortic injury and pulmonary arteries are normal.
There is a small-to-moderate right simple pleural effusion.
There is no mediastinal hemorrhage or pneumomediastinum.
The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, both adrenal glands, and kidneys demonstrate no evidence of acute injury.
There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
There is no free air and no free fluid.
The esophagus, stomach, small and large bowel including the appendix are normal.
CT OF THE PELVIS: The prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and urinary bladder are normal.
There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy.
BONES: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.
Fracture through the anterior longitudinal ligament calcification (DISH) at the T1/T2 level with widening of the anterior intervertebral space.
The fracture extends through the T1 pedicles and lamina as seen on the OSH CT of the C-spine.
This fracture involves the anterior and posterior elements and is therefore potentially unstable (series 300B, image 44).
No additional fractures are seen.
Fracture through the anterior longitudinal ligament calcifications (DISH) at the T1/T2 level and fracture through the T1 pedicles and lamina as seen on the OSH CT of the C-spine.
This fracture involves the anterior and posterior elements and is therefore potentially unstable.
No other acute injuries of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.
[**3-23**] CXR: FINDINGS: Portable AP chest radiograph demonstrates cervical and thoracic spinal fusion hardware and surgical staples overlying the mediastinum.
There are low lung volumes and dependent atelectasis, greater on the right.
An underlying effusion or focal consolidation cannot be excluded.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly enlarged, likely related to recent surgery.
There is no pneumothorax.
Mild- to moderate-sized right pleural effusion and associated right lung base atelectasis is unchanged.
Left lung base and the left costophrenic angle is obscured by the apparently large cardiomediastinal silhouette.
Left T1 pedicle and spinous process uptake consistent with subacute fractures.
No T1 vertebral body fracture detected.
There is no vertebral body fracture detected.
On admission, he was found to have a subacute T1 fracture.
#SEIZURE: The patient's baseline is [**12-15**] seizure every 2-3 days, where he looks confused for 10-30 seconds, generally no post-ictal state or tonic clonic seizures.
On [**2178-3-23**] he was witnessed to have a prolonged generalized tonic seizure (unclear duration).
CT head without acute changes.
#COAGULOPATHY / BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA: He was then noted to have a slow HCT decrease to a nadir of 25.5 on [**3-28**] from 44 over 10 days.
He had no obvious bleeding source and a CT torso on [**3-29**] revealed no hematoma.
On [**4-1**], he was noted to have oozing from his surgical site which was is not normal per the ortho spine team.
He was also noted to have bleeding from his penile meatus in the context of trying to remove his foley.
It was thought that he may have a vitamin K deficiency given the rapid onset of symptoms, his rapid improvement, and the negative inhibitor screen.
#ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: His creatinine increased on [**2178-3-29**] from baseline of 0.7 up to 1.6, which was tought to be due to vancomycin.
He had a renal ultrasound with final read pending at discharge.
#HCAP: On [**2178-3-23**] he was noticed to have rales and rhonchi with increased secretions, thought to be due to a hospital-acquired pneumonia.
He was noted to have small pleural effusion on chest imaging.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 979**] - [**Location (un) 246**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Spine fracture Coagulapathy acute kidney injury blood loss anemia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 24560**],  You admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] after a traumatic fracture to your spine following a seizure.
You tolerated the procedure well and will follow up with the spine surgeons as an outpatient  During your hospitalization you developed a pneumonia.
It may have been that this was due to deficiency of vitamin K. You were given medication and your blood started to clot effectively.
