CTA head/neck at [**Hospital1 18**] showed large right frontoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with other scattered smaller adjacent intraparenchymal hemorrhages identified.
There was no obvious aneurysm or AVM, but there was an adjacent developmental venous anomaly that may herald an occult arteriovenous malformation as the cause of this lesion.
Neurosurgery was consulted on admission, and the patient went for cerebral angiography on [**10-4**].
This showed a developmental venous anomaly in the right frontal region in the demonstrated area of hemorrhage as seen on CT and CTA, and no evidence for aneurysm/AVM associated with this.
He was transferred to the NeuroICU for monitoring overnight.
He was also found to have a microcytic anemia (Hct 36-39), but iron studies showed  Fe 64, TIBC 329, ferritin 81.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 17921**] Center - [**Location (un) 5450**], NH  Discharge Diagnosis: Right Frontal-Parietal hemorrhagic stroke, likely due to DVA (developmental venous anomaly) Microcytic anemia   Discharge Condition: Weakness of left deltoids, biceps triceps, IP, hamstrings, quadriceps, PF, and DF, but much improved from admission   Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to this hospital because you could not move the left side of your body.
You were found to have a hemorraghe in the right side of your brain in the frontal-parietal lobe.
You had a cerebral angiogram that did not reveal an aneurysm but did show a venous malformation that could have caused the bleeding.
If you develop weakness or numbness, confusion, difficulty speaking or swallowing, decreased vision or blurry vision, or any other symptoms that concern you, call your PCP or return to the ED.
