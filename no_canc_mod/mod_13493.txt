At [**Hospital1 18**] she had another episode of pulseless VT which responded to another sternal thump.

Echo [**2177-1-19**]: MEASUREMENTS: Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *4.2 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm) Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 4.4 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm) Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 55% (nl >=55%) Mitral Valve - E Wave: 1.4 m/sec Mitral Valve - A Wave: 0.7 m/sec Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 2.00 Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 280 msec TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): *33 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg)  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Right venticular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension c/w primary pulmonary process (PPH, pulmonary embolism, etc.).
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.

Patient's rhythm on the morning after admission showed pacemaker syndrome and failed atrial capture.
Her amiodarone was held and she was instructed to discontinue this medication on discharge given the potential for QT prolongation and recurrence of torsades - on admission she was found to have a prolonged QTc (likely related to hypokalemia) which is believed to have led to her torsades.
Repeat echo here showed right venticular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension c/w primary pulmonary process (PPH, pulmonary embolism, etc.).
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
She should have further workup for her pulmonary hypertension as an outpatient at [**Hospital1 2025**].
