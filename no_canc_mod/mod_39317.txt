Please refer to the dictated operative note for further details.
The surgery was without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in stable condition.
TEDs/pnemoboots were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis.
Initial postop pain was controlled with a PCA.
On HD#2 she returned to the operating room for a scheduled C4-7 decompression and fusion as part of a staged 2-part procedure.
Please refer to the dictated operative note for further details.
The second surgery was also without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a stable condition.
While in the PACU Ms. [**Known lastname **] became hypoxic and striderous and was emergently re-intubated.
She was transfered to the SICU for further evaluation where she was subsequently reintubated for a similar clinical picture.
She developed low grade fevers and she was started on Zosyn and Vancomycin.
Per review of records and discussion with PCP office, it was determined that she likely has a slowly progressive underlying dementia that is probably contributing to her altered mental status as well.
She likely has chronic spinal stenosis, but unclear why she is acutely hypotonic.
She may need urology consult as an outpatient if urinary retention does not resolve.
No contributing medications.
