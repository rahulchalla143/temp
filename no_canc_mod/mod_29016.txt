Infant had a patent ductus arteriosus noted     by an echo on [**2141-12-21**], which was small to     moderate.
The infant has     not had any cardiovascular issues since that point and     presently does not have a murmur.
The infant is     fluid restricted due to chronic lung disease with a total     fluid of 130 cc per kg per day.
Infant completed a 21 day course of     ampicillin and cefotaxime for meningitis and she was     found to have Enterobacter cloacae on [**12-24**] after     returning from the operating room for which she received     14 days of meropenem.
Following her 14 day course she was     noted to have abdominal distention, see gastrointestinal     below, and there was a concern for possible NEC.
On [**1-10**], she had a bandemia on her     CBC with 34 polys, 5 bands, 3 metamyelocytes and an     immature to total neutrophil cell count ratio of 0.2 and     thus ampicillin was changed to vancomycin.
Infectious disease had been consulted,     because of the Enterobacter cloacae infection.
The infant initially had a left grade 3 on     ultrasound that slowly resolved and currently there is no     ventricular dilatation on most recent ultrasound on     [**1-9**].
The ventricles were stable and normal in     size and there was minimal intraventricular blood.
She did have periods where she had     stool with a baseline distended abdomen.
Initially     her abdomen was soft, but this worsened on [**1-6**]     for which [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 37079**] was placed and abdominal x-rays     showed minimal bowel gas.
Chronic lung disease 2.
Possible necrotizing enterocolitis.
Multiple episodes of sepsis including Enterobacter     cloacae.
