As a consequence, there is a decrease in transparency over the left lung bases.
A pre-existing small lucency projecting over the left costophrenic sinus that was documented to correspond to a small conglomerate of cysts on the CT examination of [**2118-7-2**], is unchanged.
No evidence of pleural effusions.
Moderate aortic tortuosity.
EKG: Sinus rhythm and low amplitude P waves.
There is diffuse low voltage.

INDICATION: Significant baseline dementia with new bilateral lower extremity edema.
Complete occlusive echogenic thrombus is present within bilateral superficial femoral veins.
Minimal flow is demonstrated within bilateral popliteal veins, which also demonstrate considerable non-compressible echogenic thrombus within.
Minimal compression is demonstrated within the common femoral veins which contain a substantial amount of echogenic clot as well.
IMPRESSION: Extensive bilateral lower extremity DVTs.

<br>  # DVT - extensive in LE - here with GI bleed - though stable now - anti-coagulation will be contraindicated has high risk for bleed which pt would likely have rapid decompensation.
-IVC filter placement by IR done [**12-22**] (late afternoon) - d/w HCP-[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] prior and agreed with plan.
<br>  # Mild mental status aleration - overall at baseline now, resolved overall.
Note had trigger 3 nights prior (just mild tachycardia) - vanc/zosyn given by night coverage - pt with noted leukocytosis prior - then loose stools -given flagyl - but then c. diff noted negative [**12-20**].
d/c flagyl -overall resolved at baseline now - no infection - noted DVT as above <br>  # Fever/leukocytosis - resolved now.
As above -off abx -f/u cultures have been negative to date including c. diff -d/c PICC today prior to transfer to [**Location (un) 6107**] house <br>  # GI bleeding/Anemia, acute blood loss: Given age, DM, tenderness on exam, and rectal inflammation on OSH CT scan, was likely ischemic colitis, though differential also included diverticular bleeding, AVM.
She was treated with flagyl due to concern for ischemic colitis allowing transolcation of bacteria.
Hct were other wise stable though patient continued to have pink/red stool.
Patient's HCT remained stable, and did not have recurrance of florid hematochezia, although did have isolated episodes of red mucus-like stools.
- Flagyl d/c'd - do not anticipate further transfusion needs - h/h now established as stable, no further monitoring required - just for facility to observe stools for frank blood or melena - otherwise no interventions planned at this time <br>  # Acute renal failure: Cr 2.3 on admission.
stable - avoid nephrotoxins - encourage po hydration <br>  # Hypernatremia pt had developed hypernatremia on [**12-15**] likely d/t poor free water intake.
<br>  # Urinary tract infection: + UA.
<br>  # DM II, controlled, without complications: Treated with home NPH 28units QAM and sliding scale (half doses while NPO).
BS mildly elevated prior - increased NPH to 30units [**12-20**] pm - cont to follow.
PO once a day as needed for constipation.
