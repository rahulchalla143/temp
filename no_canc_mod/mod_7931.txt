The trauma team had already explored the Zone 2 neck lesion and flank injury, and performed a negative exploratory laparotomy.
I was asked to come in to assist with tracheal repair for an obvious midline neck wound with air emanating from it.
Past Medical History: S/p L orbital reconstruction at age of 14, s/p MVA with subarachnoid hemorrhages @ age 21 ([**2145**]).
Family History: noncontributory  Physical Exam: VS: T: 98.5  HR: 80 SR  BP: 123/71  Sats: 98% RA General: 29 year-old male in no apparent distress HEENT: normocephalic, mucus membranes moist Card: RRR Resp: clear breath sounds bilateral GI: bowel sounds positive abdomen soft Extr: warm no edema Incision: cervical meds, neck, and abdomen site margins well approximated no erythema Neuro: non-focal   Pertinent Results: [**2156-5-3**] WBC-6.1 RBC-2.85* Hgb-9.1* Hct-25.6 Plt Ct-174 [**2156-5-4**] Glucose-97 UreaN-9 Creat-0.6 Na-143 K-3.8 Cl-108 HCO3-29 [**2156-4-30**] Glucose-102* UreaN-10 Creat-0.8 Na-136 K-4.4 Cl-106 HCO3-20 [**2156-5-4**] Calcium-8.7 Phos-3.6 Mg-1.8  Chest X-Ray: [**2156-5-7**]: there has been some reduction in the small apical pneumothorax on the right.
Lungs are clear and there is no vascular congestion or pleural effusion.
[**2156-5-1**]:Limited assessment of the ET tube placement and limited assessment of the right lung apex, where a small right apical pneumothorax was previously seen.
Allowing for this, no acute pulmonary process is identified.
2) Linear lucency along mediastinum - ?
artifact due to atelectasis vs pneumomediastinum.
A third party hand is seen over the right apex and right neck for airway stabilization.
There is a moderate right pneumothorax.
There is extensive subcutaneous air identified in neck bilaterally tracking into the chest wall and axilla.
There is pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium, with no air-fluid level to suggest hemopericardium.
THere is no pulmonary edema.
Basilar opacities are likely atelectasis or aspiration, possible bloody.
There are no displaced fractures identified.
Extensive subcutaneous air, pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium.
Basilar opacities may reflect aspiration or hemorrhage.
He was taken to the operating room, where the trauma team had already explored the zone 2 neck lesion and flank injury, and performed a negative exploratory laparotomy.
Neuro: The patient's pain was initially relieved by PCA dilaudid with good effect and adequate pain control.
He had no neurologic deficit.
Bronchoscopy: Flexible bronchoscopy done [**2156-5-7**] revealed anastomatic margins intact no signs of necrosis.
Chest Films: he was followed by serial chest films which showed stable small right apical pneumothoraxs.
No signs of infection.
