Prominence of vascular markings at the hilum bilaterally.
Attenuation at the right costophrenic angle, and mildly at the left costophrenic angle.
Findings could suggest congestion, bibasilar atelectasis, pleural effusion, more on the right, and/or pneumonia especially at the left lung base.
Old rib fractures at the left lung base.
Question of a nondisplaced rib fracture at the right mid rib.
If there is a clinical concern, designated rib film could be done to evaluate this further.
Bilateral pulmonary emboli.
Large saddle embolus in the right main pulmonary artery and segmental left lower lobe branches with associated peripheral airspace opacification and small right pleural effusion.
Bowing of the intraventricular septum and increased ratio of the right to left ventricle suggestive of possible component of right heart strain.
Enlarged heterogenous appearance with multiple nodules noted in the left thyroid lobe compatible with multinodular goiter.
Diffuse ground glass opacity and interlobular thickening suggestive of component of congestive heart failure.
Atherosclerotic disease involving the thoracic aorta.
Old left healed rib fractures.
4mm right lower lobe subpleural pulmonary nodule.
Persistent tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
Small right pleural effusion has possibly increased in the interval with adjacent atelectasis.
Minimal linear atelectasis at left lung base.
CT head - CONCLUSION: Chronic findings unchanged since [**Month (only) **] [**2154**].
No evidence of hemorrhage.
Continued small right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis and minimal streaks of atelectasis at the left base.
Mild prominence of interstitial pattern without evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
F with remote CVA, remote DVT, admitted with large bilateral pulmonary emboli, initially stable on floor but required ICU stay for hypercarbic respiratory failure  # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: PCO2 on ABG with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
This was thought to be secondary to decreased respiratory drive given oxygen supplementation, possibly underlying COPD.
Patient without documented history of COPD but has 25 pack year smoking history.
# Altered Mental Status: Occurred in the setting of hypercarbia.
# Pulmonary emboli: large bilateral PE.
CT exhibited evidence of right heart strain but echo showed intact RV function.
Pt did not require thrombolytic therapy.
# Right sided rib pain: Thought to be secondary to pleuritic pain cause by pulmonary emboli.
This pain made deep breathing difficult.
However, pain gradually resolved with standing tylenol.
#pulmonary edema: Pt developed transiently in the ICU in the setting of IVF for hypercalcemia.
# Hypercalcemia: Pt found to have hypercalcemia especially in the setting of low albumin.
# Hypertension: patient with a history of hypertension maintained on outpatient beta blocker and lasix.
# Schizophrenia: Pt with remote history but did act appropriately during hospitalization.

Your pain was controlled with Tylenol.
You were also found to have high level of calcium, and it was determined that this was due to high levels of Parathyroid hormone.
Over the course of your hospitalization, your pain became better controlled, your breathing and oxygenation have improved.
1.Your calcium was stopped 2.Your vitamin D was stopped 3.You were started on a blood thinning medication, coumadin for your blood clot for which you should likely take for a lifetime.
Please return to the emergency department immediately if you experience any increased confusion, agitation, fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain.
