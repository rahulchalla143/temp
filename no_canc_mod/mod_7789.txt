NECK: Supple, no jvd CV: RR, NL rate.
ABD: Soft, mildly distended and tense, nontender.
Normal BS, no masses palpated EXT: 1+ pitting edema bilaterally.
Low lung volumes limit evaluation.
There is ill definition of the left heart border which may be related to early lingular pneumonia.
In addition, there are increased bronchovascular markings in the right cardiophrenic recess which is likely related to crowding of bronchial vasculature/low lung volumes.
There is no pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.
Possible early pneumonia in the lingula.
Somewhat limited study due to low lung volumes.
[**2118-9-20**] CXR There is minimally increased opacity seen projecting over the left heart margin.
There is also new opacity projecting over the right lung base and right costophrenic angle.
Otherwise, there are no new foci of infection.
Mild interval increase in left lingular opacity, likely pneumonia.
[**2118-9-20**] CT Head with contrast: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular territorial infarct.
Following administration of contrast, there are no abnormally enhancing masses.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of enhancing intracranial mass or fluid collection.
[**2118-9-22**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST: Multifocal peribronchovascular and peripheral ground-glass opacities and consolidation progressive over a week, most likely viral or mycoplasma pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, or idiopathic pneumonia such as acute interstitial or eosinophilic varieties.
Tiny amount of perihepatic ascites.
Multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes could be related to the acute process or to HIV.
[**2118-9-26**] CT ABD w/ CONTRAST: Massive abdominal and pelvic ascites with thickened bowel , most likely consistent with anasarca.
Nodular liver with recanalization of umbilical vein and underlying splenomegaly, concerning for cirrhosis.
Multilobular ground-glass pulmonary opacities with no definite cause, most likely due to underlying edema.
[**2118-9-27**] PERITONEAL FLUID: NO POLYMORPHONUCLEAR LEUKOCYTES SEEN.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
FLUID CULTURE: NO GROWTH.
ANAEROBIC CULTURE: NO GROWTH.
[**2118-10-6**] DUPLEX DOPPLER ABDOMEN - Cirrhosis, without a focal liver lesion seen.
Moderate abdominal ascites, mostly surrounding the liver.
No safe spot for paracentesis could be marked.
Steroids begun due to worsening inflammation and pO2 <70 on ABG.
Bactrim changed to primaquine/clindamycin on [**2118-9-26**] due to Bactrim-induced leukopenia (down to 1.1).
Headache: CT and LP were negative for intracranial mass or infection.
Hypothermia: Hypothermic to 92.7 on second transfer from MICU, resolution with warming blankets and broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn).
Hepatitis C: Previously diagnosed, never treated because of psychiatric history and adherence issues.
Acute decompensation during hospital stay with distended abdomen, abdominal pain, and mental status changes attributed to hepatic encephalopathy.
Concern for hemolysis given low haptoglobin, but few schistocytes on smear, so low concern for TTP despite mental status changes, hypothermia, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia (near baseline).
Low retic count suggests bone marrow suppression as well as possible hemolytic component.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for sleep.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) HIV/AIDS Hepatitis C virus and cirrhosis with acute liver decompensation Hepatic encephalopathy Hemolytic anemia Thrombocytopenia   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, in no respiratory distress   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because of fever and cough.
You were treated for this pneumonia with antibiotics and steroids.
During your hospitalization, your liver disease became worse, and you had some extra fluid in your belly and your legs because of this.
