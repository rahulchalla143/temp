Admission Date:  [**2166-3-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2166-4-1**]   Service:  Medicine, [**Hospital1 139**] Firm  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation (status post pacemaker placement for symptomatic bradycardia), obstructive sleep apnea, cor pulmonale, chronic renal failure, and peripheral vascular disease who was transferred from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the floor status post management of a hypercarbic respectively decompensation.
The patient originally presented with knee pain on [**2166-3-26**].
He called Emergency Medical Service who found the patient to be dyspneic and hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 70% on room air.
Of note, the patient had been complaining of increased lower extremity edema and dysphagia for which he was seen in the [**Hospital6 733**] Clinic on [**3-21**].
His dysphagia was for solid foods, and the patient described it as if "something was caught in my throat."
The patient was referred for Ear/Nose/Throat and had a swallowing study done on [**3-25**] (one day prior to admission) with a barium esophagogram showing a nonspecific motor disorder of the esophagus with one episode of aspiration.
The patient did give a history of gradually increasing dyspnea without chest pain.
He received 40 mg of intravenous Lasix, 120 mg of intravenously methylprednisolone, albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers, and aspirin 325 mg.  An electrocardiogram was done revealing ST elevations in leads III and aVF and ST depressions in leads I and aVL.
He was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory and catheterization showed clean coronary arteries.
In the Catheterization Laboratory, the patient developed further deterioration of his mental status as well as hypoxemia and respectively acidosis with an arterial blood gas of 7.25/61/67.
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the team felt that his presentation was likely secondary to an aspiration event in the setting of his lying flat in the Catheterization Laboratory.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
Chronic renal failure (with a baseline creatinine of 1.2 to 1.5).
Status post pacemaker placement for symptomatic bradycardia.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Venous insufficiency.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, the patient was sitting upright in bed, in no acute distress.
The neck was without lymphadenopathy and with normal jugular venous pulsation.
Distant heart sounds.
The lungs with occasional coarse expiratory wheezes.
Extremity examination revealed 1+ pitting lower extremity edema to the knees bilaterally with venous stasis skin changes.
Urinalysis revealed yellow/clear and small blood.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest radiograph on [**3-26**] revealed an increased density at the left base, right hemidiaphragm less distinct, perihilar edema consistent with heart failure.
A chest radiograph on [**3-27**] showed decreased heart failure, no infiltrates, and decreased bibasilar atelectasis.
No distinct wall motion abnormalities in the left ventricle.
Trace aortic regurgitation.
Catheterization on [**3-26**] revealed no significant obstructive disease.
No wall motion abnormalities.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension of 38 mmHg.
PULMONARY ISSUES:  Initially, after transfer from the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient continued to have a 4-liter to 5-liter of oxygen requirement to maintain his oxygen saturation.
His episode of hypoxemia was felt to be most likely secondary to an aspiration event followed by flash pulmonary edema in the setting of diastolic cardiac dysfunction.
His furosemide was held starting on the evening of [**3-29**] because he started to appear hypovolemic on examination with dry mucous membranes and poor skin turgor.
He received a video oropharyngeal swallowing study which demonstrated an intact swallowing mechanism with no evidence of aspiration.
To rule out further heart failure, a chest radiograph was obtained on [**3-31**] which demonstrated some bibasilar atelectasis, but no evidence of heart failure.
The patient was completing a 10-day course of levofloxacin and metronidazole for aspiration pneumonia.
LEG PAIN ISSUES:  The patient notably had persistent pain in both his lower extremities below the knees throughout his admission.
The legs were symmetrically slightly edematous and tenderness to palpation anteriorly and posteriorly.
Lower extremity venous ultrasounds with Doppler studies were obtained and revealed no deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.
Given the patient's recent history of twisting his left ankle, a plain film was obtained which revealed no evidence of fracture or dislocation.
The patient described his pain as "tingling" as well as "burning."
This was felt to be perhaps secondary to a neuropathy; although the patient did not have known conditions that would predispose to a neuropathy such as diabetes.
His acute-on-chronic renal failure was felt to be secondary to prerenal azotemia in the setting of the furosemide he was given as well as the dye load he received in the Catheterization Laboratory.
Another condition of the differential diagnosis was acute tubular necrosis secondary to the dye load he received.
He had persistent mild elevations in his fasting blood sugars which ranged between 150 and 200.
Status post aspiration event and heart failure exacerbation in the setting of diastolic cardiac dysfunction.
Chronic renal failure; status post acute-on-chronic renal failure.
Bilateral peripheral sensory neuropathy.
Hypoproliferative normocytic anemia of undetermined etiology.
Diffuse deconditioning.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
History of pacemaker placement for symptomatic bradycardia.
Obstructive sleep apnea (requiring [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure).
Peripheral vascular disease.
