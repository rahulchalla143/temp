Mastoid air cell and paranasal sinus opacification is likely related to tracheostomy.
Right lower lobe opacification with areas of non-enhancing pulmonary parenchyma concerning for necrotizing pneumonia.
Bilateral moderate pleural effusions.
Evidence of right heart failure with congested liver, periportal edema, trace ascites, and gallbladder edema (no evidence to suggest cholecystitis).
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] yo M h/o parkinson's disease, chronic respiratory failure (s/p trach, ventilator dependent) admitted to the ICU with acute encephalopathy, UTI and pneumonia.
# Oliguria / acute renal failure: The patient experienced progressive renal failure and oliguria throughout his ICU course.
A family meeting was held on HD#4 with the patient's wife, [**Name (NI) **], to discuss the patient's poor overall clinical status as well as his progressive, likely irrevocable, renal failure and the decision was made to pursue comfort care options at that time in concert with his wife's understanding of his wishes given the clinical circumstances.
The patient became progressively bradycardic during HD #3, and by 19:35 he progressed to asystole on telemetry monitoring.
The patient's pupils were fixed and dilated, and he was noted to be without spontaneous respirations.
# Respiratory acidosis: On admission the patient appeared to be retaining carbon dioxide in the setting of increased secretions and penumonia seen on CT. His exam was diffusely wheezy and ronchorus.
Repeat ABG's are showed worsening of his acid-base status on HD#1, despite these interventions.
Due to his extensive wheezing on examination, he was started on albuterol and ipratropium MDIs through the ventilator to aid with bronchidilation, as well as methylprednisolone to help reduce airway inflammation.
# Hypotension: Initially in the ED he was responsive to IVF, but subsequently required the initiation of norepinephrine.
# Pneumonia: CT abdomen on admission showed possible necrotizing pneumonia in the right lung bases, likely consistent with aspiration-associated pneumonia, given the presents of debris in the left bronchi.
The patient was started initially on vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl for broad spectrum empiric coverage, which was titrated down to ceftriaxone in the setting of his sputum culture results.
# Bacteriuria: UA concerning for UTI, with the culture pending.
