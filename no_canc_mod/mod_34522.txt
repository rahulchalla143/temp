Admission Date:  [**2135-12-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-12-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2104-8-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ibuprofen  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8388**] Chief Complaint: Headache, blurry vision and HD line displacement  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: HD Tunneled Line Placement   History of Present Illness: This is a 31 yo male with h/o biliary atresia s/p liver [**First Name3 (LF) **] age 4, now again with cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, awaiting liver/kidney [**First Name3 (LF) **], recently discharged with klebsiella bacteremia and MSSA cellulitis, completed abx therapy on Tuesday, who presented to the ED after his HD catheter fell out.
That was also obtained in the ED with multiple cortical/subcortical infarcts which could be consistent with septic emboli.
The patient was being evaluated by ophthalmology for the visual loss, and while he was being examined, the patient had a seizure.
He was given vancomycin and 2 gm CTX in the ED for meningitis coverage.
Past Medical History: -biliary Atresia s/p liver [**First Name3 (LF) **] at age 4 (25 years ago) -asthma, well-controlled -right hip avascular necrosis, per ortho may need THR -postinfectious glomerulonephritis s/p renal biopsy [**2135-5-24**] showed IgG dominent exudative proliferative GN, c/w postinfectious GN -nephrotic syndrome (4.1g proteinuria), hypoalbuminemia -small bowel resection   Social History: denies any tobacco, EtOH or illict drug use.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Vitals - T: 98.4 BP: 132/92 HR: 102 RR: 22 02 sat: 95% on RA GENERAL: Awake, oriented to [**Hospital1 18**], date, in NAD laying in bed in MICU at time of exam HEENT: No cervical LAD, no thyroidmegaly, neck supple, no JVD, HD catheter in place R neck CARDIAC: Tachycardic to ~100, regular, no clear murmur LUNG: CTA bilaterally ABDOMEN: Soft, NT/ND, +NABS, no organomegaly EXT: Pitting edema of LE bilaterally, 2+ radial and DP pulses b/l NEURO: Strength 5/5 in UE and LE; sensation grossly intact b/L, CN II-XII intact, although eye movements (vertical and horizontal) are not smooth (unclear whether patient has difficulty following commands; looks away frequently during exam).
Patellar reflexes difficult to assess (given absence of reflex hammer) but are present and equal ([**11-26**]+).
DERM: Multiple (dozens) discrete skin lesions on arms, abdomen, lower legs that appear to be the result of scratching/excoriations, scabbed over, some with surrounding erythema suggestive of possible superinfection.
No lesions on back where patient is unable to reach.
Multiple foci of acute infarction in both cerebral hemispheres.
Repeat MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: IMPRESSION: Evolution of previously seen foci of decreased diffusion.
The distribution may represent a combination of a "watershed" type infarct related to hypoperfusion and embolic (either bland or septic) phenomenon.
However, there is no new infarct identified.
EEG:  This is an abnormal noncontinuous extended routine EEG due to slowing and disorganization of the background rhythm and bursts of semirhythmic, moderate voltage, bifrontally predominant generalized theta/delta activity.
The first finding suggests a mild to moderate encephalopathy.
The generalized slowing suggests possible deep or midline dysfunction.
No epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures were seen during this recording and this telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
TEE: No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
MRI L spine: IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
The findings suggest arachnoiditis and are similar to the prior study.
Severe canal narrowing just inferior to the L4-5 disc space secondary to osseous proliferative changes and epidural lipomatosis.
Moderate bilateral subarticular zone narrowing at L4-5 with what appeared to be mildly swollen bilateral L5 roots.
Bilateral L5 spondylolysis with fluid clefts and surrounding edema is most likely all degenerative.
No drainable fluid collection is identified and the lack of interval change from the study one month prior makes infection unlikely though should be correlated with clinical findings.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 40167**] was admitted for (1) replaced of his tunneled line and (2) a constellation of neurological findings including headache, changes in vision, and while in ED, a seizure.
EEG was negative for epileptiform activity.
He was empirically started on antibiotics for meningitis, however all of his symptoms acutely resolved.
An MRI showed evidence for embolization; septic emboli was a possibility, however other embolic phenomena were also a possibility, given that embolization could have occured at the moment of displacement of his HD line.
The presence of AV shunts secondary to hepatopulmonary syndrome would have allowed for migration of venous emboli.
Peritoneal fluid was negative for SBP.
TEE was negative for vegetations.
Repeat MRI showed continued presence of previously seen MRI but again was not necessarily consistent with septic phenomena.
Keppra was continued given his prior seizure with instruction to discontinue Keppra after 2 weeks if no seizure event occured.
Medications on Admission: albuterol sulfate inhaler [**11-26**] every 6 hours PRN furosemide 20 mg by mouth once daily ipratropium bromide 1 daily PRN Lactulose 30 ml up to 1 times daily (written for up to 4times daily but doesnt need it) metoprolol 25mg twice daily oxycodone 5 mg Q8 hours PRN pain Reglan 1 tablet 4 times a day sucralfate 10 ml 4 times a day tacrolimus 0.5 mg twice daily.
Camphor-Menthol 0.5-0.5 % Lotion Sig: One (1) Appl Topical QID (4 times a day) as needed for itchiness.
Cirrhosis secondary to congenital biliary atresia 3.
End stage renal disease secondary to post-strep GN on hemodialysis   Discharge Condition: Stable for home, saturating normally at room air.
You were admitted because your [**Hospital1 2286**] line fell out; you also experienced multiple symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and blurry vision.
We performed an imaging study of your brain which showed several areas that were concerning for a stroke or infection.
Because we were worried about infection, we performed several studies to search for an infectious source, however we could not find any sign of infection in your body.
We did briefly start you on antibiotics but your symptoms cleared spontaneously, which suggests that this is less likely to be an infection.
