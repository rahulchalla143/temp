There, he was noted to have stable vitals signs but guaic positive from below; Hct was 29.8, INR 2.
He then had a large bout of hematemesis and was given 2u PRBC's, 2u FFP, intubated with Fent/Versed/Vecuronium, started on Octreotide gtt and given 40 mg IV PPI (vs PPI gtt?)
Stat RUQ u/s was done which showed fatty cirrhotic liver, patent portal and hepatic vasculature with appropriate flow directions, extensive parahepatic varices, trace ascites, splenomegaly, and 2 right sided kidneys.
On exam here, he appeared to have sequelae of liver disease with jaundice, distended abdomen, hepatomegaly; noted to have blood in his NGT.
Past Medical History: from [**Location (un) **] correctional facility infirmary  - Hepatitis C cirrhosis - EtOH - Anemia - Asthma - HTN - Compressed Disc   Social History: Currently incarcerated at [**Location (un) **] correctional facility.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Exam on admission: VS 96.9  104/48  p66  99% on 50% 500 x 14 PEEP 8  Thin, jaudniced appearing M, intubated and sedated with dried blood around nares and mouth, +scleral icterus, pinpoint pupils not very reactive.
Inspiratory stridor noted diffusely on both sides, with decreased breath sounds on the L and decreased at the bases Hyperdynamic heart with S1/S2 noted, no m/g, very easily palpable PMI at midclavicular line Abd soft, not tender or grossly distended, liver edge palpable 5cm below R costal margin No BLE edema noted, legs are very thin but warm, not mottled Skin jaundiced, with spider angioma on thighs Neuro exam deferred  On discharge, he was afebrile with stable vital signs.
Mild diffuse tenderness to palpation, improved.
NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2108-7-11**]):    NO GROWTH.
LEGIONELLA CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO LEGIONELLA ISOLATED.
Endoscopy [**2108-7-8**]: Impression: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction (ligation) Erythema, congestion and mosaic appearance in the whole stomach compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum .
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion .
Extensive parahepatic varices and splenomegaly signifying portal  hypertension.
Patent portal and hepatic venous and hepatic arterial flow, with appropriate flow directions.
Enlarged slightly heterogeneous pancreas.
Active Issues: 1.Hematemesis -- On admission pt was vomiting bright red blood, c/f large volume blood loss.
He was intubated to protect his airway and had an endoscopy which revealed grade II-III varices.
He was treated with an octreotide drip, IV PPI, and IV ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis.
His Hct improved over the course of his admission, and he had no further episodes of hematemesis.
He continued to have melena but this also resolved during his admission.
Left upper lobe collapse, LLL pneumonitis: Seen incidentally on CXR, likely [**2-15**] aspiration of blood vs GI contents in the setting of hematemesis vs intubation.
His repeat CXR showed interval re-inflation of the LUL but persistent small area of opacification of the LLL.
He remained afebrile, breathing comfortably and oxygenating well on room air, so clinical suspicion for pneumonia was low.
Cirrhosis -- likely [**2-15**] ETOH abuse given history and AST:ALT ratio > 2.
He has several signs of chronic liver disease on exam, including spider angiomata, palmar erythema, and palpable liver edge below costal margin.
DVT prophylaxis: He was encouraged to wear pneumoboots to prevent DVT as SC heparin was contraindicated in the setting of acute bleed.
Chronic issues: Asthma -- he remained stable on his home dose inhalers.
Hypertension -- no known home meds (although takes nadolol for varices), BP remained well controlled throughout stay.
He should refrain from ETOH consumption, and minimize use of tylenol due to his liver disease (no more than 2g/24 hours).
On discharge he was afebrile and breathing comfortably, however if he develops fever, SOB, or cough productive of green-yellow sputum he should get repeat CXR due to his risk of pna from aspiration and intubation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Esophageal varices Anemia Cirrhosis .
When you arrived, your blood pressure was very low due to your blood loss and you received a blood transfusion.
You were intubated to protect your airway and help you breathe, and then had an endoscopy which showed bleeding vessels in your esophagus called varices, which are due to your liver disease.
On the medicine floor, you were treated with medications to prevent bleeding of the varices and for your liver disease.
