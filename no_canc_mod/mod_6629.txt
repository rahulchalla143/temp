His girlfriend does add that he took "a couple" doses of Advil for abd pain over the past few days.
Labs came back with marked renal failure, so requested ICU admission for closer monitoring of electrolytes, possible need for emergent HD.
Also, on insulin gtt for elevated blood sugars and gap acidosis.

No plan for tx with Pegylated interferon and rivavirin as nonresponder to prior tx.
Cath with minimal disease; thought to be due to vasospasm.
- H/o infrarenal aortic dissection in [**2186**]; stable on CT in ED - Glaucoma  Social History: Drinks one beer per week.

No CVA tenderness.
No gait disturbance.
No cerebellar dysfunction.
SKIN: No jaundice, cyanosis, or gross dermatitis.
Sinus rhythm.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing sinus rhythm has replaced ectopic atrial rhythm.
There is a linear opacity seen in the left lower lung field, consistent with subsegmental atelectasis.
The lungs are otherwise clear without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
There is no free air seen under the diaphragm.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary pathology.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 year-old male with DM c/b gastroparesis, nephropathy, p/w 5 days of vomiting, abd pain c/w prior gastroparesis pains, and acute renal failure  # Acute renal failure with dehydration.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he was given IVF: 1 L NS at 250 cc/h x 2, 1 L Bicarb 1/2NSD5W at 250 cc/h, also given 500 cc NS bolus x 2 for SBPs in the 90s now SBP in the 110's.
Also received 4 gm Ca gluconate for low ionized free Ca given his symptomatic hypocalcemia as his Ca was expected to continue to decrease with resolution of his acidosis.
His repeat lytes after 2 L showed a decrease in Cr from 11.3 to 8.1, then after more fluids his Cr decreased to 4.8.
He was started on phosphate binder due to elevated phosphorus.
# Electrolyte abnormalities:  He was treated with calcium and phosphate binders for acute hypocalcemia and hyperphopshatemia.
# Anion gap acidosis:  He was admitted with an anion gap acidosis, due to both acute renal failure and hyperglycemia.
# Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus; records indicate that he is type 2, but given his severe complications at a relatively young age, he may be actually be producing very little insulin/type 1.
It was difficult to rule out DKA given his elevated gap acidosis and elevated blood sugars, but given his overall clinical status and the dramatic renal failure, renal failure likely explains the acidosis.
# neuropathic pain: continued home percocet regimen.
# gastroparesis: His gastroparesis was the precipitant for his renal decompensation.
Viagra 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day as needed for impotence.
