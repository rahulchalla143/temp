HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 82 year old female is a resident of [**Hospital3 24509**] Home with a history of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and diabetes who was found down in a puddle of urine the morning of admission.
There was no evidence of trauma and the patient was alert and oriented at least according to her baseline mental status.
A few hours later she was noticed to have a left facial droop, dysarthria and left-sided weakness as well as diaphoresis and being cold to touch.
She had a glucose of 404 for which she received 4 units of insulin with no improvement and was brought to the [**Hospital6 256**] Emergency Room for a concern of possible cerebrovascular accident.
The stroke fellow saw her in the Emergency Room and found her examination showing no evidence of cerebrovascular accident but noticed bradycardia with pauses of up to 4 seconds.
Post procedure the patient denied chest pain, shortness of breath, reported mild nausea but no diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, cough or fevers or chills, but she does not remember her fall.
She has mild pain at the transvenous pacer insertion site.
Dementia of vascular type also with history of Alzheimer's type although it is not clear how the latter can be confirmed given the former.
Degenerative joint disease 4.
Anemia 5.
History of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia/paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia for which she takes atenolol and digoxin.
Low back pain with spinal decompression in [**2128**] and epidural steroid injections.
Per nursing home a history of personality disorder.
The patient is Do-Not-Resuscitate, Do-Not-Intubate but other intervention including pressors are okay.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat reveals oropharynx clear, mucous membranes dry and the patient was edentulous.
In general the patient was in no acute distress and answered questions intermittently, was insulting to staff with occasional inappropriate comments, otherwise was an elderly well developed, well nourished female.
Cardiovascular, the patient was in a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Extremities, 1+ edema, nonpitting, no cyanosis or clubbing.
Troponin mildly positive at .8.
Chest x-ray showed right middle lobe, +/- right lower lobe, pneumonia consistent with aspiration.
The patient was status post transvenous pacemaker placement with no pneumothorax or complication.
Electrocardiogram, sinus arrest with asystole, poor junctional escape without ischemia, however, with 3 to 4 second pauses, long QT.
After pacemaker was placed, electrocardiogram showed V-paced rhythm at 70, left axis deviation, wide QRS with reciprocal changes and a left bundle branch pattern.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiology, electricity, for the patient's initial intermittent sinus arrest with long pauses and unreliable junctional escape she was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit and had an urgent transvenous pacemaker placed [**7-12**] with recapture.
There was no clear etiology.
Digoxin level was normal and there was no evidence of ischemia.
The next morning she was noticed to be intermittently pacer independent but still having long pauses at times requiring pacer function.
Further although her Digoxin and atenolol were held, since the pacemaker could have ceased functioning and her nodal blockers would have produced an intrinsic rate, she was going to need these for the history of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, therefore permanent pacemaker was placed [**2133-7-14**] when her pneumonia was under good control.
On [**7-15**], the patient did have several runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia but the significance of this without known coronary artery disease and reduced ejection fraction is unknown.
She also had [**7-15**], AM a run of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia with a rate of 100 to 120s which self-terminated and as a result the team increased her atenolol her 50 mg.
Coronaries and pump - No known issues.
The patient tolerated rehydration without desaturation.
CKs dropped with time, MB fractions were never positive and CKs were assumed to be from a long lie and not from a coronary source.
Pulmonary - The patient was felt to have pneumonia, right middle lobe and right lower lobe, possibly secondary to aspiration, see infectious disease for details.
Oxygen was weaned off with good saturations on room air and no shortness of breath, also with resolution of infiltrates, at least partially on post pacemaker films which may indicate a resolving pneumonitis rather than an actual pneumonia.
She is on an ACE inhibitor which will help control a decline in function of her diabetes mellitus.
Infectious disease - Given Levofloxacin and Flagyl in the Emergency Room for aspiration pneumonia this was renally dosed and then doses were increased after her creatinine was normalized.
Flagyl was not continued because of the very low incidents of anaerobic infections and aspiration pneumonia and her good pulmonary function.
Levofloxacin was to be continued for two doses for a total of five day course given her good room air status, decrease in abnormal chest x-ray and lack of shortness of breath or fever at any point.
For low urine output and concentrated urine, initially she was rehydrated with result of increased clear urine output and normalization of creatinine.
Endocrine - The patient's diabetes Type 2 was managed with q.i.d.
TSH was checked secondary to elevated CK but the CKs normalized as expected as they would from a long lie at the nursing home and TSH was normal at 1.6.
Neurology - The patient had no facial asymmetry or weakness detected throughout her hospital stay and therefore no head computerized tomography scan was obtained.
The patient presumably had a transient ischemic attack representing acute illness bringing out chronic cerebrovascular disease.
Her multi-infarct dementia would best be preventively managed with aspirin if her presumed allergy is not significant and blood pressure and glucose control and an ACE inhibitor which she is already on.
Musculoskeletal - The patient remained immobile in bed throughout her stay but had no decubiti ulcers.
Mild sacral edema was noted the day of discharge.
which may be increased for blood pressure control as well as control of her paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
which is to be increased if she is hypertensive on a good dose of Atenolol 7.
4 to 6 hours prn constipation 11.
Status post DDD pacemaker for intermittent sinus arrest and bradycardia 2.
