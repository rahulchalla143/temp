Past Medical History: Hypertension Dyslipidemia Depression ETOH PVD     Social History: Unknown   Family History: NC   Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM: O:  BP: 143/86 HR: 80 R:16 O2Sats: 98% ventilated with FiO2 1 Gen: Lying in bed with eyes closed, intubated.
Pertinent Results: CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**4-4**]: CT OF THE CHEST: There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
There is no pericardial effusion or mediastinal hematoma.
There is no evidence of aortic injury.
Minimal bibasilar atelectasis is noted, although tiny amount of aspiration cannot be excluded.
There is a calcified right apical pleural plaque versus surgical changes.
Scattered ground- glass opacities throughout both lungs are noted and may represent areas of pulmonary hemorrhage or contusion in the setting of trauma.
Bilateral areas of bronchiectasis and emphysematous changes are noted.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: There is marked periportal edema.
Within the right kidney, there is a hypodensity in the right mid to upper pole measuring approximately 1.3 cm and likely represents a cyst, although is incompletely evaluated.
Small bowel loops are normal in caliber and without focal wall thickening.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Within the left lower quadrant, there is an area of mesenteric stranding (2, 76), which may represent mild mesenteric injury.
There is no evidence of free air or free fluid.
There is no bowel wall thickening.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions identified.
There is no evidence of acute fracture.
Bilateral ground-glass opacities.
In the setting of trauma, this may represent pulmonary hemorrhage or contusions.
Although given chronic lung findings such as bronchiectasis, this likely represents an infectious or inflammatory process.
Left lower quadrant mesenteric fat stranding concerning for mesenteric injury.
No free air or free fluid.
No definite bowel wall injury identified.
Head CT [**4-4**]: FINDINGS: There is re-demonstration of the extensive, multicompartmental hemorrhages described in the previous report.
Please refer to that document for a complete description of the findings.
There is no other overt change in the appearance of the remaining hemorrhages as well as contusions, described previously.
There is no alteration in the ventricular size or configuration.
Head CT [**4-6**]: FINDINGS: Overall, little change is demonstrated to large left temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage measuring 3.8 cm in anteroposterior dimensions and right temporal parenchymal hemorrhage measuring 3.4 cm in anteroposterior dimensions.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage surrounding the left cerebral hemisphere is more conspicuous on current study.
Small subdural hematoma layering along the tentorium is redemonstrated.
Intraventricular hemorrhage remains without new hydrocephalus.
Effacement of folia in the cerebellum is again demonstrated consistent with diffuse cerebellar edema.
Effacement of sulci involving the left cerebral hemisphere and to a lesser degree on the right, consistent with diffuse cerebral swelling.
No new major shift of midline structures or herniation demonstrated.
Similar degree of sinus opacification redemonstrated.
IMPRESSION: Little overall change in the appearance of the head since [**2178-4-4**], without evidence of new hemorrhage or herniation.
There are considerable quantities of secretions within the upper airway, superior to what is presumably an endotracheal tube cuff.
No definite prevertebral soft tissue swelling is seen, allowing for the obscuration of this area by the secretions noted above.
At C4-5, there is a shallow posterior spondylytic ridge causing mild flattening of the ventral cord margin.
There is mild left-sided foraminal stenosis due to an uncovertebral spur.
At C5-6, a shallow left paracentral posterior spondylytic ridge is seen, with moderate left-sided foraminal stenosis.
At C6-7, uncovertebral spurring produces moderate left foraminal stenosis.
There is no other observable cervical spinal abnormality seen.
The spinal cord signal pattern, foramen magnum and its contents are normal.
CONCLUSION: Cervical spondylosis.

Final Report INDICATION: Patient is a 51-year-old male with known epidural subdural hematoma status post assault, now status post repeat fall with trauma to the head.
Left temporal parenchymal hemorrhage demonstrates a very slight reduction in size measuring now 3.8 x 2.1 cm where on prior examination it measured 4 x 2.4 cm.
There is associated surrounding hypoattenuation compatible with perihemorrhagic edema.
There is mild effacement of the left-sided perimesencephalic cistern that is unchanged since prior examination from [**2178-4-10**] with no progression.
There has been little overall change in a right anterior temporal epidural hematoma which measures 1.5 cm where from prior examination it measured 1.4 cm.
There is a small amount of layering hemorrhage along the tentorium that is largely unchanged since [**2178-4-10**].
Previously described intraventricular hemorrhage involving the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is not clearly apparent on current examination.
There is persistent mass effect with compression of the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle without evidence of hydrocephalus.
There is an unchanged appearance of mixed attenuation in the bilateral frontal lobes with a small left frontal subdural hematoma.
There is a right-sided temporal cephalohematoma.
S-shaped deviation of the nasal septum is stable.
IMPRESSION: Little interval change in multifocal hemorrhage with right anterior temporal epidural hemorrhage, and left parenchymal temporal hemorrhage unchanged with associated mass effect including mild effacement of the perimesencephalic cistern and the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
Wet Read: ARHb SUN [**2178-4-19**] 10:16 AM Interval slight decrease in size of left temporal intraparenchymal hematoma with slight less mass effect on left perimesencephalic cistern and persistent mass effect on left lateral ventricle.
While right temporal epidural hematoma is less conspicuos, likely secondary to evolution of blood products, some increase in size of this collection is suggested.
Final Report INDICATION: 51-year-old male with intraparenchymal hemorrhage status post fall out of bed.
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: The hyperdense portion of a left temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage demonstrates slight reduction in size, currently measuring 3.5 x 1.9 cm compared to 3.8 x 2.1 cm on [**4-13**].
Surrounding perihemorrhagic edema is again noted with persistent mass effect on the left lateral ventricle including compression of the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
There has been interval improvement in the degree of effacement of the left perimesencephalic cistern.
Approximately 4 mm of rightward shift of midline structures appears not significantly changed.
The previously noted right anterior temporal epidural hematoma is less conspicuous, likely secondary to evolution of blood products.
The previously noted subdural hemorrhage lying along the tentorium and intraventricular hemorrhage is also less conspicuous.
Mixed attenuation of the frontal lobes bilaterally and a possible small left frontal subdural hematoma do not appear significantly changed in the short interval.
No new intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
Minimal sphenoid sinus mucosal thickening is noted with a few secretions noted in the left maxillary sinus.
A right-sided temporal cephalohematoma is not significantly changed.
Slight decrease in size of left temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with persistent surrounding edema and mass effect on the lateral ventricle.
Mass effect on the left perimesencephalic cistern has decreased.
Limited evaluation of known right anterior frontal epidural hematoma, though slight increase in size of the fluid collection is suggested.
