Again, there is similar mass effect upon the adjacent gyri without shift of normally midline structures, or effacement of the basal cisterns.
Mass effect on the left lateral ventricle is similar in appearance.
High- density material layering along the left tentorium is as previously seen.
No new focus of hemorrhage is noted.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent with small vessel ischemic disease.
Vascular calcifications are noted along the cavernous carotid arteries.
Hematoma along the right frontotemporal scalp is again noted.
Mucosal thickening is noted in the visualized maxillary sinuses, and small amount of layering fluid within the sphenoid sinuses and left maxillary sinus as well as fluid within the nasal cavity are likely related to ET tube and OG tube which are in place.
IMPRESSION: Subdural hematoma along the left parietooccipital region and also layering along the left tentorium not substantially enlarged compared to earlier on the same day.
Mass effect on the adjacent sulci, without new shift of normally midline structures.
CT head [**2190-1-24**] 1:38 PM: FINDINGS: There is a lentiform collection along the extra-axial space involving the left parietal region measuring 2 cm in greatest width with mixed hyper- and hypo-attenuation.
There is local mass effect upon the adjacent sulci with sulcal effacement and mass effect upon the ipsilateral atria of the lateral ventricle.
A small amount of hyper-attenuation localizes to the left tentorium consistent with subdural hemorrhage.
Right frontal subgaleal hematoma is small.
Bilateral lens replacements.
Hyperacute upon acute moderate extra-axial parietal hemorrhage with given lentiform shape is concerning for epidural rather than subdural hematoma.
Associated mass effect upon the ipsilateral lateral ventrical and adjacent sulci as described above.
Small amount of subdural hemorrhage layering along the left anterior tentorium.
Small right frontal subgaleal hematoma.
Cerebral atrophy with no acute hydrocephalus.
He was GCS 15 on arrival and was urgently brought to the CT scanner where he was found to have an expanding 2cm SDH with no mass effect.
The patient had some desaturation on [**1-28**] and [**1-29**] without oxygen to the 80s.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion, lethargy or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
New onset of the loss of function, or decrease of function on one whole side of your body.
