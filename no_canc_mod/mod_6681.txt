A CT scan without contrast was performed which showed a possible intramural thrombus with a 5 cm aneurism extending to the left renal vein, with 2 areas of ulceration.
She continued to have back pain so she was transferred to the vascular surgery service at [**Hospital1 18**].
CT scan of the chest without contrast showed possible extension to the thoracic aorta.
During this admission she developed a different pain in the chest, which lasted minutes.
She was transferred to cardiology for possible cardiac catheterization.
Past Medical History: PVD, gout, [**Last Name (un) **] esophagus, GERD, atrial fibrillation, vetigo, skin squamous cell CA s/p excision, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension  Social History: Social history is significant for previous tobacco use (25 pack years).
Moans, agitated and attempting to climb                out of bed.
HEENT:  Has left gaze preference and eyes cross just past midline                on right with Doll's.
Right lower facial droop.
Does not blink to                threat in right visual fields.

Patient exam prior TPA is significant for left eye gaze deviation, right hemianopsia, severe dysarthia, not following commands and left arm/face > leg motor weakness.
Likely etiology of stroke is cardioembolic with known Afib and recent MI with known hypokinesis/akiniesis in the inferior lateral ventricle (no thrombus visualized on TTE) or thrombus visualized in intraabdominal aortic aneurysm.
Neuro:  There was minimal improvement in exam the morning following TPA administration (L gaze deviation, weak withdrawal R arm, no speech, does not follow any commands), repeat Head CT at 24 hours showed some R cerebellar hemorrhage and hemorrhage into infarct.
She was given Ativan PRN anxiety, Morphine PRN pain and Scopolamine and Levsin for secretions.
NSTEMI with elevated troponin to >5, CK peak at 468 continuing to trend down.
likely unstable plaque.
Continue to hold on cath until renal failure resolves.
currently chest pain free.
Held ACE given renal failure.
Rhythm - NSR, no arrhythmias.
# Acute renal failure - likely secondary to contrast or prerenal etiology.
Renal ultrasound showed patent right artery; left kidney old and small in size.
Needed to place foley catheter with regard to urinary retention and renal failure.
# Bladder spasm - likely related to UTI given spasm, dysuria, and +UA.
Given baseline urinary dysmotility and retention, would prefer to treat as "complicated" UTI and use 7 days of therapy.
the current symptoms appear acute worsening of her chronic urinary problems.
