Admission Date:  [**2137-10-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-10-18**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-2-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxic respiratory failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Extubation (intubated at outside hospital).
History of Present Illness: 39 year old female with history of type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, heavy smoking history, and benzodiazepine and narcotic abuse in the past, who presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital this morning complaining of 3 days of dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting.
She also was having nausea and vomiting, brown emesis.
Given diffuse expiratory wheezes on examination she was given solumedrol 125 mg IV x 1.
A CXR revealed a LLL pneumonia and she was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
She had persistent hypoxia, with desaturation to the high 80s and initial ABG 7.21/61/74, prompting intubation.
Additionally, cardiac enzymes were elevated with a CK of 1900, MB of 25 with a normal MB index, and elevated troponin I to 0.43 (nl < 0.1).
An EKG showed lateral TWI in I and aVL, without ST segement changes.
Labs also notable for a leukocytosis at 24,000, with 83% PMNs and 2% bands.
Cardiology was consulted given the cardiac enzyme elevation at the outside hospital, and given that she had no EKG changes, they recommended holding off on heparin for now and trending the enzymes.
Labs otherwise notable for a leukocytosis at 22,000, hyperkalemia of 5.3, and hyperglycemia of 260.
Past Medical History: 1) Type 2 diabetes 2) Hypercholesterolemia 3) Narcotic, benzodiazepine abuse 4) Heavy smoking history.
No history of asthma or COPD that the family is aware of.
Family History: Her father had an MI at the age of 37.
Her mother does not have heart trouble.
HEENT:  Mild ecchymosis just inferior to right orbit.
Bilateral peri-orbital edema.
3) Large left basilar consolidation/effusion, suspicious for pneumonia in the right clinical context.
NCHCT [**10-13**] - There is no evidence of acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage.
There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
There is opacification of the nasopharynx in this intubated patient, presumabl collapsed airway as well as fluid content.
EEG [**10-16**] - Markedly abnormal EEG due to the slow and disorganized background along with bursts of generalized slowing, some of which included spike or sharp and slow wave rhythmic patterns.
These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathy.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
Nevertheless, the bursts of generalized slowing included spike or sharp and slow wave features and raise concern for the possibility of seizures.
If the patient's status changes or a concern for non-convulsive seizures persist, additional recordings would be of benefit.
There is no evidence of hilar enlargement.
A better technique chest x-ray demonstrates absence of any mass in the right middle lobe.
The pleural surfaces are smooth with no pleural effusion .
However, in the cervicomedullary region, there is subtle area of increased signal intensity on the FLAIR images (series 6, image 2), which is incompletely evaluated, as no sagittal FLAIRS are available.
No obvious contrast enhancement is noted in this area on the sagittal post-contrast images.
Brief Hospital Course: 39 year old female with history of type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, heavy smoking history, and benzodiazepine and narcotic abuse in the past, presenting with dyspnea and hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to left lower lobe pneumonia.
1) Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to drug overdose.
Pt intubated at [**Hospital **] transferred to MICU here and self-extubated the next day without any subsequent difficulty protecting her airway, no problems with hypoxia, hypercarbia.
Was placed on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for treatment of a community acquired pneumonia.
Was febrile on presentation with elevated WBC to 21 with left shift.
She was started on steroids at the outside hospital for question of obstructive component given wheezes on exam, however here, her resistance was not elevated on the ventilator, she had no wheezes, and no history of obstructive lung disease, therefore steroids were discontinued.
2) Drug abuse:  Given the history of narcotic and benzodiazepine abuse, a toxicology panel was ordered, and returned positive for methadone and other opiates.
[**Last Name (STitle) 70643**], who stated that he did not presribe clonazepam or methadone for pt and was not aware that pt was on either drug.
Had prescribed MS Contin 15 mg po q12h and Vicodin 1 tab prn for chronic pain issues in the past.
Psych consult also obtained who felt that pt's ingestion was not secondary to a suicide attempt and 1:1 sitter d/c'd.
As pt remained slow to answer questions when called out to the medical floor, MRI head ordered and ruled out for anoxic brain injury.
EEG significant for diffuse slowing [**1-3**] toxic, metabolic encephalopathy, with occasional burst of slow and spiking wave activity concerning for seizures; however not sustained enough to rule in active seizure activity.
3) Elevated cardiac enzymes:  Elevated at outside hospital, however normal MB index.
4) HTN - Noted to have persistently elevated BPs, not at goal of < 130/80.
Disp:*4 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 8063**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Methadone Overdose Community Acquired Pneumonia .
Secondary Diagnosis: Diabetes Mellitus, type II Hypercholesterolemia Hypertension h/o benzo and narcotics abuse   Discharge Condition: Good.
You will need to finish a 10 day course of antibiotics for treatment of a community acquired pneumonia.
