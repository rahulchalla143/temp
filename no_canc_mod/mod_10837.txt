Admission Date:  [**2192-7-22**]     Discharge Date:  [**2192-8-10**]  Date of Birth:   [**2168-11-24**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 23-year-old male with a history of anxiety and heroin use who was found unresponsive at home.
There was a Serax bottle with 13 pills missing found at the bedside, as well as some unknown substance in his safe.
He was started on ceftriaxone secondary to a chest x-ray showing a left-sided aspiration pneumonia.
An electrocardiogram had peaked T waves which improved once at the [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Department.
Intravenous fluids were given in the Emergency Department in combination with the renal failure which prompted respiratory hypoxia; therefore, the patient was intubated.
Pulmonary was positive for rales at the left base with decreased breath sounds.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed 1+ lower extremity edema and 2+ pules throughout.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Abdominal film had no free air.
Electrocardiogram had no signs of ischemia.
His course was complicated by bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome.
He was oxygenating well; however, he continued to spike temperatures along with an elevated white blood cell count that resolved over a few days without antibiotics.
A pleurocentesis was performed prior to the resolution, and it showed 201 white blood cells and [**Pager number **] red blood cells, but no growth on culture.
An ultrasound ruled out deep venous thrombosis.
Neurology was consulted secondary to decreased mental status.
A magnetic resonance imaging of the head was obtained which was negative for blood, infection, or edema.
Psychiatry came in and felt that his mental status change was delirium.
Neurology was also involved with the patient's left-sided weakness that was found once awake and alert.
This showed no osteomyelitis, but there was a 5-cm region suspicious for a hematoma in the left gluteal region.
An ultrasound was obtained to rule out an abscess in this area.
It showed no focal fluid collection, and no evidence of an abscess.
It was positive for a left gluteal hematoma; although, a mass could not be ruled out.
It showed no spinous central canal stenosis or neuroforaminal narrowing.
Creatine kinase trended down; last checked was 6274, and his electrolyte abnormalities resolved.
Acute renal failure.
Left gluteal hematoma.
DISCHARGE RECOMMENDATIONS:  Between two to four months the patient should have a repeat ultrasound of the left gluteal region to assess for absorption of hematoma versus a mass that would prompt an outpatient workup.
