History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 83900**] who is an 86-year-old male with past medical history of atrial fibrillation, First and second-degree Wenckebach AV block, severe aortic valve stenosis, systolic congestive heart failure, presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion and need of tissue AVR scheduled for [**2127-4-21**] presenting to CCU for aspirin desensitization.
From an AS standpoint, he was not deemed high enough surgical risk for Core Valve and thus given his progression of symptoms with dyspnea with minimal exertion, decision was made to proceed with AVR.

Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.

Moderate 2 vessel coronary artery disease with diffuse atherosclerosis.
Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.
[**4-21**] CXR: Since the prior study, there is interval progression of bilateral interstitial opacities most likely representing chronic interstitial lung disease, potentially fibrosis.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
Assessment of the patient with chest CT for precise characterization of the severity and extent of pulmonary abnormalities might be considered.
[**4-27**] CXR: The left lower chest tube has been removed.
There is a small left apical pneumothorax, similar in size compared to the study from the prior day.
Mild pulmonary vascular redistribution and volume loss in both lower lobes.

The patient sternal incision showed a small amount of seroud drainage, and he was started on Kefzol.
Chest tubes were discontinued on post-op day 4 without complication.
Lopressor was discontinued for intermittent Type II heart block.
He will be dischared on Lasix 80mg IV BID x 7 days for his CXR and peripheral edema.
