Periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities are consistent with small vessel ischemic disease.
Marked ventricular and sulcal prominence is increased from prior study and is related to global atrophy.
No fracture identified.
Air-fluid levels and aerosolized secretions noted within the sphenoid sinus as well as partial opacification of the ethmoid air cells.
No soft tissue swelling identified.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Acute sinus disease  CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2137-4-15**] IMPRESSION: No acute cardiothoracic process.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 84 yo F with advanced dementia (nonverbal for 4 years and nonambulatory), DM2, HTN, brought from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for AMS and admitted to the ICU for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state and sepsis secondary to UTI.
# Delirium on Dementia: According to the report, patient is non-verbal at baseline; however, lethargy and inability to tolerate oral intake x 3 days represented an acute change.
# Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state/Diabetes mellitus type 2, uncontrolled, with complications: Patient had altered mental status, elevated seurm osms, and serum glucose with anion gap acidosis.
Though urine was positive for ketones patient has had very poor oral intake x 3 days and decreased po intake x 1 month, ketonuria is related to starvation ketosis rather than DKA.
# Urinary tract infection:  U/A was grossly positive with leukocyte esterase, many WBC and bacteria.
Culture data from [**Hospital3 **] revealed proteus sensitive to ceftriaxone.
She briefly received meropenem while in the ICU until culture from [**Hospital1 18**] returned no growth.
# Hypovolemic hypernatremia: Related to poor po intake and exacerbated by osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia.
# Acute on Chronic Renal insufficiency: According to past medical history from nursing home patient has CKD, baseline creatinine unknown.
# Chronic congestive heart failure: EF unknown.
Patient appeared hypovolemic on exam on admission and was euvolemic on discharge.
# Hypertension:  She was gradually restarted on metoprolol and lisinopril as tolerated.
