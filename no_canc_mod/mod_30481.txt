Admission Date:  [**2169-10-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-11-6**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Percocet / Codeine / Nutren Pulmonary  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**] Chief Complaint: Urosepsis and pneumonia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement [**2169-11-2**]   History of Present Illness: 85F from [**Hospital1 **] with reports of R facial droop and slurred speech.
Neurology was consulted and felt that she did not suffer a large stroke and as such, no TPA was indicated.
In the ED, she received vanco, ceftaz, steroids, 1 unit PRBCs, and tylenol for hypotension and presumed sepsis.
She was admitted to ICU for sepsis secondary to PNA and UTI.
Given her h/o multidrug resistant pseudomonas UTIs, she was started on meropenem with clinical improvement.
Urine cultures from day of admission, however, revealed pseudomonas was resistant to meropenem.
Additionally, cultures from a recent bronchial washing revealed MRSA and, given pneumonia on imaging and clinically with associated sepsis, she has been continued on vancomycin since admission.
She is being transferred to the care of her primary cardiologist for further management of the above issues while hospitalized.
ROS: denies fevers, chills, shortness of breath, dysuria, frequency, hematuria, hematochezia, chest pain, admits to shortness of breath, but says is baseline, admits to fatigue and weakness.
Complains of pain on right thigh secondary to zoster.
Past Medical History: 1)Asthma > 5 hospitalization with no history of intubations.
3)Steroid induced hyperglycemia.
4)Peripheral vascular disease, status post left fem-peroneal bypass in [**2162**] 5)Multi-focal bacterial pneumonia.
7)Multi-focal atrial tachycardia.
9)Question left hilar mass.
Family History: Asthma in her father  Physical Exam: T 97.1 HR 89 BP 131/66 O2 sat 99% on 2L NC Weight 61 kg Gen: pleasant cooperative NAD HEENT: very dry MM, PERRL Cor: tachycardic, irregularly irregular, II/VI systolic murmur heard loudest at the apex and radiating to L axilla Pulm: tachypneic, diffuse rhonchi, egophany in the RLL field Abd: +BS, soft/NT/ND, JPEG in place Ext: 2+ doughy edema B/L LE, dressing in place over stasis ulcers on B/L LE (L appears superficial, 1cm; R shows some muscle, but appears to be healing well), strength lower extremities [**1-29**] bilaterally, upper extremities [**3-1**] bilaterally.
Skin: fragile skin, chronic venous stasis changes, scattered ecchymoses, xerotic Neuro: thinks she was recently in [**State 108**].
Ptosis of right eye, mild right facial droop.
No tongue deviation.
Pertinent Results: [**2169-10-29**] Portable CXR: Persistent left lower lobe opacity and effusion.
2.Similar rounded right infrahilar density, previously felt to represent rounded atelectasis.
New right lower lobe opacity which may represent recurrence of atelectasis or pneumonia.
No hemorrhage.
Chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
Sinus disease as noted above.
EKG: ectopic rhythm with right axis and right bundle branch block .
Limited assessment for hilar mass due to absence of intravenous contrast.
If the patient has strict contraindications to iodinated contrast, MRI of the chest should be considered to answer the clinical question of hilar mass.
Confluent rounded opacity in right infrahilar region which has developed since [**2169-9-15**] and probably represents a combination of round atelectasis and reactive lymph nodes, but is not fully characterized on this unenhanced CT scan.
Persistent lower lobe bronchial impaction and combination of atelectasis and consolidation, in keeping with the provided history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
New multifocal centrilobular nodular opacities likely reflect a diffuse bronchiolitis, either from aspiration or infectious etiology.
New small amount of ascites, development of anasarca, and slight increase in small bilateral pleural effusions.
Diffuse mesenteric stranding throughout the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, a nonspecific finding.
Diffuse coronary artery calcifications.
There is  mild aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**11-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 85 woman with PNA and UTI, leading to severe sepsis.
# Sepsis:  Likely secondary to urinary tract infection and pneumonia.
Sensitivity data demonstrated pan-resistant pseudomonas in the urine, however, in discussion with infectious disease, in [**Last Name (un) 5153**] sensitivities may not appropriately reflect in [**Last Name (un) **] sensitivities and meropenem is concentrated in the urine so may indeed adequately treat her pseudomonal infection.
Her blood pressures stabilized and did not require pressors, she was in addition maintained on Vancomycin renally dosed, as she recently had the history of MRSA pneumonia in [**2169-9-15**].
# CHF: Likely diastolic dysfunction (impaired relaxation on recent echo)given preserved EF.
She initially had bilateral pleural effusions, LE edema, and ascites/anasarca seen on CT, but patient is currently maintaining O2 saturations in the mid 90s on RA.
She did transiently have increased oxygen requirement with oxygen saturations in the mid 80s on room air which required 4L O2 by NC to maintain O2 sats in the mid 90s.
Her daily weights and ins and outs should be closely monitored as she may require brief tid dosing or addition of a thiazide diuretic prior to her lasix doses.
# Pneumonia:  She demonstrated a RLL infiltrate on imaging and given her recurrent aspirations, she was continued on meropenem (started originally for pseudomonas urosepsis).
She was also continued on vancomycin given her history of MRSA pneumonia.
# ARF:  Baseline in [**Month (only) **] 0.9.
FeNa was 0.1% on admission, and likely reflects a forward flow issue in the setting of sepsis and CHF.
Her creatinine was 2.3 on admission which improved with treatment of her infections and active diuresis and was 1.4 on discharge.
# Steroid-induced hyperglycemia: She is on nightly lantus which was increased due to elevated blood sugars.
She did have a low blood sugar on admission due to tube feeds being stopped at rehab, but was within normal limits subsequently.
Recent iron studies [**8-/2169**] reveal normal iron, low TIBC, and elevated ferritin, thus appear consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
She was scheduled for colonoscopy recently, but the test was held secondary to hypoglycemia.
On admission, rehab staff reported mild right facial droop.
Seems likely a reflection of her Bell's Palsy given mild chronic right sided deficits prior to this episode.
The patient herself noted no new deficits during her hospital stay.
Head CT on admission was negative for acute bleed.
Neuro exam is back to her baseline without new focal deficits and her right sided facial findings are also at baseline upon discharge.
# Pulmonary Mass: Appears on CXR and Right hilar mass was also seen on chest CT. She will need future follow-up imaging to monitor for change.
# H/O zoster: She reported pain on her right anterior thigh at the site of previous zoster outbreak, but no vesicles/rash were ever visualized.
She was treated with gabapentin and a lidoderm patch.
Zolpidem 5 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: Two (2) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2732**] & Retirement Home - [**Location (un) 55**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Urosepsis Pneumonia CHF HTN Steroid induced hyperglycemia .
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you develop fevers, chills, lightheadedness/dizziness, fainting, worsening cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, pain/discomfort/blood with urination, blood in your stool or dark tarry colored stool or any other symptoms that concern you.
Please note we have decreased your dose of gabapentin/neurontin because your renal function is slightly decreased.
We will also keep you on antibiotics for a full 2 week course to finish on [**2169-11-12**]  You have a mass in your right lung.
