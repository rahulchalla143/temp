Left lower lobe opacities could represent aspiration versus pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with advanced Alzheimer's dementia who presented to the ED with altered mental status and hypotension, found to have a leukocytosis, positive UA, hypernatremia to 171, and ARF.
met [**3-2**] SIRS criteria (WBC 14.7 and HR 100) and has evidence of infection, likely urinary source, based on UA with positive LE, >182 WBCs, and many bacteria.
Initially presented with hypotension 88/61, which improved with 2L NS.
With treatment of her infection and with IVFs (see below), she was able to be weaned off the pressor and was transferred to the medical floor.
This degree of hypernatremia most likely represents a significant free water deficit caused either by decreased PO intake of free water, or increased urinary losses, i.e.
diabetes insipidis.
# Altered mental status:  Caretaker reported that she was less responsive than baseline.
This may be exacerbated by underlying UTI/sepsis as well as baseline severe dementia.
's severe hypernatremia and evidence of volume depletion on exam argue strongly for a pre-renal etiology.
# UTI: Patient with evidence of UTI on urinalysis, but culture was without growth.
She was initially started on vanco/cefepime given likely sepsis (above) and later transitioned to ampicillin.
She continued to spike low grade fevers, so was transitioned back to cefepime and ultimately transitioned to PO ciprofloxacin to complete a 7 day total course on [**2176-10-17**].
# LLL consolidation: Patient with evidence of pneumonia vs. aspiration pneumonitis on CXR from [**10-14**].
She was without cough and leukocytosis had resolved and patient remained afebrile.
She was seen by speech and swallow given aspiration risk and they felt she could eat with precautions and recommended pureed solids and nectar thick liquids.
# HTN: Patient was initially hypotensive from sepsis (above) and home atenolol was held on admission.
# Advanced Dementia, Goals of care: Pt was initially full code when admitted to the MICU.
She requested that procedures that would cause pain not be performed.
# Transitional issues: - Patient is now home hospice, she was provided with prescriptions for pain medications and a hospital bed will be delivered to her home - Several medications were discontinued on discharge, including memantine and simvastatin in order to simplify medicine regimen - Patient to complete a course of ciprofloxacin on [**2176-10-22**]   Medications on Admission: Preadmission medications listed are correct and complete.

You were also found to have an infection in your blood, urine and possibly in your lungs as well.
You will be provided with prescriptions for pain as needed and a hospital bed will be delivered to your home.
