He then began to have fevers up to 99.0-100.0 and yesterday started to develop left sided chest pain that came on with deep breaths and coughing, and fevers up to 103 degrees with chills but no rigors.
He is coughing up scant, thick yellow sputum, without any blood in the sputum.
He was last hospitalized here from [**6-29**] -> [**2161-7-6**] for persistent pain from a right-sided kidney stone.
A chest X ray during that admission revealed a faint opacity in the left lower lobe that obscured the left hemidiaphragm on the lateral view.
Cxray notable for LLL infiltrate.
EKG notable for sinus tach at 92, negative axis, R wave transition in v3, flat T waves V5-V6, q3T3, q in [**12-30**]/avf (no change from baseline).
In short, patient was in his usual state of health until three days prior to admission when he experienced more fatigue, fevers up to 99.0-100.0, pleuritic chest pain and cough.
(Patient was last hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**6-29**] to [**2161-7-6**] for persistent pain from a right-sided kidney stone, a stent was placed and removed.)
Chest xray was notable for LLL infiltrate.
EKG notable for sinus tach at 92, negative axis, R wave transition in v3, flat T waves V5-V6, q3T3, q in [**12-30**]/avf (no change from baseline).
On transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] patient continues to express sharp chest pain in left sternal area radiating to left shoulder [**5-7**] in intensity worse with inspiration, patient also reports not some SOB.

Brief Hospital Course: 40 M w/ AIDS (CD4 of 9), multiple medical problems presents with dypnea and fever.
SOB - On the floor antibiotic was changed to cefipime.
One day following admission, patient developed additional chest pain and hypoxia initially read in o2 sat of 70s requiring 10L of O2 at which patient was 93% (abg was 7.35/34/90 on 10L face-mask), patient's systolic blood pressure was also in 100s compared to baseline of 130s.
Unclear if relative hypotension was secondary to pain medications, dehydration, developing heart failure from possible PE, verus worsening PNA, therefore patient was transferred to unit.
CT on [**8-29**] showed: LLL PNA, effusion, enlargement of nodule at left lung apex and new nodule in the medial LUL nodule, possibly representing differences in slice selection compared to [**9-30**].
Patient will need to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2148**] regarding further work-up of these findings.
Fever - Patient with AIDS, history of fever and chest xray/chest CT notable for PNA.
Patient without diarrhea.
CRI/Hematuria - Patient with a history of renal stones, recent admission for kidney stone and urthethral stent presents with elevated CR compared to baseline.
Patient experienced elevated troponins during episodes of chest pain.
Seizure thought to be due to a focus from scar of a prior brain abscess.
Patient reports using gabapentin for neuropathic pain.
Anemia - Patient presented with a hematocrit of 34, wide variation in baseline (34-44).
This decrease likely reprented fluid shifts from hydration.
The differential for anemia includes low production given anemia of chronic disease, low reticulocyte count.
