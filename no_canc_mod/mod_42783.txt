CT abdomen concerning for ischemic colitis but surgery opting for medical management.
They asked for ICU admission to optimize her hemodynamics for a concern for alow-flow state.
Given Cipro/flagyl for empiric coverage.
The patient was tearful, increasingly anxious and confused.
Did not complain of any abdominal pain, CP, SOB.
On further questioning she admitted that she had abdominal pain previously, but not during time of interview.
Did complain of pain at laceration site.
He thought that since then she had been complaining of abd pain, no associated n/v/d, no fevers.
DPTA she had gotten OOB to BR during the night and had falled and cut her leg which precipitated this presentation.

There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Multilevel degenerative changes involving the lower thoracic and lumbar spine are noted.
CT ABD: Nonspecific colonic wall thickening involving the splenic flexure, raising the possibility of ischemic colitis from a low-flow state in this watershed region.

Increasing small bilateral pleural effusions, with partial loculation of the right-sided effusion.

A CT was performed and found circumferential thickening around the colon at the splenic flexure, concerning for watershed ischemia of the colon.
Less likely was the possibility of infectious colitis, given that the patient had some diarrhea and a WBC count with a left shift, however, she was afebrile throughout the hospital stay and the clinical presentation was more consistent with chronic abdominal pain and the incidental finding of ischemic colitis, likely an old event.
She never had bloody stools.
Urine tests to evaluate for the possibility of a UTI causing abdominal pain were negative.
Initially, the LFTs were increased (AST:ALT) c/w possible alcoholic liver disease but no ETOH was present in serum, the specimen was hemolyzed, and repeat LFTs were normal.
We monitored her abdominal exams serially in conjunction with surgery, who felt that the patient did not have acute ischemic colitis.
For a conservative approach, we did continue the cipro/flagyl for empiric coverage but this can be stopped after 5 days if she remains stable.
She was given morphine for pain control.
# Systolic heart failure: Her exam was notable for some evidence of acute on chronic systolic heart failure, including elevated JVP, LE edema, crackles on exam, and an elevated BNP.
She was subjectively less short of breath and overloaded at the time of transfer.
# Chest wall fluid collection: Pt had an area of erythema and warmth over the ICD site.
A chest wall U/S showed a tiny fluid collection in the region of the AICD.
The patient did not endorse tenderness and exam was not significant for fluctuance, so we do not think this represents active infection, but this should be monitored.
#Leg laceration: She sustained a laceration after a fall, which was sutured in the emergency department.
An xray of the leg was grossly unremarkable without evidence of subcutaneous emphysema or soft tissue loss.
#Anxiety: She has chronic anxiety and was given ativan as needed.
She was noted to have oral thrush and was treated with Nystatin S&S.
# Access: PIV .
# Communication: son = [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3234**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 103186**]   Medications on Admission: UNK, via interpreter pt states that she gets her medications from the [**Company 4916**] on [**State **] St, presumably this is the [**Company 4916**] in [**Location (un) 669**].
Lorazepam 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: One (1)  Injection Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Chronic mesenteric ischemia Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure  Secondary Dignoses: Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation Leg laceration Diabetes Mellitus Anxiety Oral Candidiasis   Discharge Condition: Afebrile Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were treated at [**Hospital1 18**] for chronic mesenteric ischemia with bowel rest and rehydration therapy and will be transferred to [**Hospital6 **] for further treatment.
