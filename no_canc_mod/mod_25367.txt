Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.
History of coronary artery disease.
Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, status post open     repair.
Acalculous cholecystitis, status post cholecystectomy.
Respiratory failure, adult respiratory distress syndrome.
Atrial fibrillation.
Acute renal failure.
Mr. [**Known lastname 68921**] is a 76-year-old gentleman who had a syncopal episode and was found to have ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at [**Hospital3 **] where he was brought to while being extremely hypotensive.
He was immediately taken to the operating room upon arrival for open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and the aneurysm was repaired with a 16 mm Dacron tube graft but the abdomen was left open secondary to significant edema.
In terms of his respiratory status, the patient developed ARDS and subsequent prolonged respiratory failure precluding any weaning from the ventilator.
His course was also complicated by postoperative atrial fibrillation for which the cardiology service was consulted and followed.
On postoperative day 2, the patient was taken to the operating room for an abdominal exploration and was also noted to have acalculous cholecystitis for which he underwent a cholecystectomy.
Given the significant amount of intra- abdominal edema, there was concern that abdominal compartment syndrome would develop so the abdomen was left open.
Mr. [**Known lastname 68922**] renal function deteriorated to the point of acute renal failure.
The nephrology service was consulted but, given his multiorgan system failure, it was felt that the patient should be made comfort measures only after discussion with the family.
Causes of death were essentially multiorgan system failure and shock secondary to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm with progressive respiratory  and renal failure.
