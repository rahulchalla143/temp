PNEUMONIA: Patient had a LLL PNA on CXR from OSH and sputum culture with many polys.
PERICARDITIS: He had pleuritic CP with diffuse ST elevations on EKG and normal CEs, suggestive of pericarditis.
He was started on NSAIDS following recovery of his renal function.
ACUTE SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: He had evidence of biventricular heart failure on ECHO at OSH with EF 25% and elevated PAP pressure of 40.
His depressed contractility was thought to be secondary to sepsis vs myocarditis.
He did not appear volume overloaded on exam.
- A follow-up echo should be done to look for resolution of heart falure.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Patient appeared to have acute prerenal failure, likely from sepsis and decreased cardiac output.
As he recovered, his creatinine improved from 1.8 to 1.4  HYPERGLYCEMIA: Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] may have borderline diabetes at home.

Discharge Condition: Afebrile, VSS   Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized because you had pneumonia and were septicemic.
Because of your condition, you had some transient loss of heart efficiency, which we expect to improve with time.
Your blood pressure and heart rate are stable and well controlled without medications.
