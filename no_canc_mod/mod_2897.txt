Within this limitation, there is a splenic laceration with focal area of hyperdensity within the spleen, which may represent a dilated varix and less likely a pseudoaneurysm.
No active bleeding is seen.
This is suggestive of a more central stenosis, perhaps subclavian or brachiocephalic vein.
No definite liver or bowel injury, however evaluation limited due to aforementioned limitations.
Multiple left-sided rib fractures.
Seminal vesicles hypodensities which may represent cysts.
There is left basal opacity most likely consistent with atelectasis giving its new appearance compared to prior study obtained on [**2160-10-19**].
The known rib fractures are partially obscured by the projection of the pacemaker.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax, and there is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
He had some left upper quadrant abdominal pain and his hematocrit on admission was 25.
The abdomenal and pelvic CT from [**Hospital1 **] was reviewed by the radiology department and was felt that there was no extravasation of fluid in the pelvis.
The splenic laceration was also very small.
His blood pressure was stable and his abdominal pain resolved.
Of note, he had a foley catheter placed 5 weeks ago as his son was having a difficult time caring for him with his urinary incontinence, especially with daily lasix.
Unfortunately a urine culture was done at [**Hospital1 **] which grew out Proteus Mirabilis sensitive to Cefazolin.
