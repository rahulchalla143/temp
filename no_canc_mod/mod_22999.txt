He was brought to an  outside hospital, [**Hospital 12017**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 3844**], where it was recognized that he likely had a cervical spinal cord injury and imaging demonstrated fracture dislocation C4-C5.
He was subsequently transferred by helicopter to [**Hospital1 18**] for tertiary trauma care evaluation for definitive spinal management.
Past Medical History: asthma  Social History: Lives with fiance and 2 children in [**Location (un) 3844**]  Family History: Noncontributory  Physical Exam: Upon presentation to [**Hospital1 18**]: General:  intubated, on propofol and vecuronium; C-collar in place, backboard; unresponsive; examined a second time when off propofol/vecuronium  HEENT:  pupils 3mm, very slight response Neurologic examination:  no reflexes elicited BUE, BLE; no response to [**Doctor Last Name 937**] or babinski; no rectal tone.
Pertinent Results: [**2184-8-7**] 07:00AM BLOOD WBC-5.2 RBC-3.41* Hgb-10.8* Hct-32.0* MCV-94 MCH-31.8 MCHC-33.8 RDW-14.4 Plt Ct-269 [**2184-8-18**] 01:00PM BLOOD Plt Ct-296  IMAGING: [**6-23**] (CXR) - no ptx, no effusion, no mediastinal widening [**6-23**] (C-Spine OSH) - C4-5 subluxation fx [**6-23**] (CT Head OSH) - (reportedly) negative [**6-24**] (MRI C-spine) - 1.
Intramedullary cord signal abnormality spanning the levels of C2-C6, most compatible with cord edema and with a more focal heterogeneous component which expands the cord at the level C4-C5 that raises the possibility of underlying intramedullary focal hemorrhage/hematoma.
Status post C4-C5 posterior fusion with improvement in previously noted acute malalignment.
Strongly suspected disruption of the posterior longitudinal ligament.
C4-C5 disc protrusion with superior extrusion of contents demonstrated immediately posterior to the C4 vertebral body which at this point results in elevation of the posterior longitudinal ligament and abuts the ventral aspect of the spinal cord.
[**6-28**] (KUB - PEG Contrast Scan): no contrast extrav [**6-29**] (CXR): Desaturation and increased FiO2 with right lung base consolidation on CXR - Bronchoscopy with BAL (Bronchus intermedius BAL and RLL BAL with Left BAL) performed; Patient started on Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro for suspected VAP.
Suboptimal image quality.
No definite vegetations.
[**7-2**] (CXR): Interval worsening of RLL PNA w/ new opacity in the  lingula suggests ?sequelae of aspiration.
[**7-3**] (KUB): contrast study PEG w no extrav; +significant free air [**7-4**] (CT torso): B pleural effusions, complete collapse of RLL c/w consolidation, mod pneumoperitoneum likely d/t PEG air leak, no e/o solid viscus perf, rounded focus of consolidation in LUL likely infection [**7-22**] (LENIs): No evidence DVT [**7-23**] (CT neck/torso): No fluid collxn, lymphadenopathy or bony destruction in neck.
RLL consolidation decr in size w/remaining rounded density c/w atelectasis.
He was continued on Ativan for anxiety and Dilaudid as needed for pain, both to decent effect.
Psychiatry assessed and believed his delirium to be multifactorial in nature and to avoid psychiatric medications for the short term.
His delirium did clear over the next few days.
His depression was thought to be an appropriate response given the circumstances and he was started on antidepressant therapy and followed closely by Social work during his stay who felt his coping was appropriate as well.
Early he had continued desaturation episodes and CXR imaging was concerning for mucous plugging.
He was also noted to develop a right lower lobe consolidation, concerning for ventilator associated pneumonia, and he was started on broad spectrum antibiotic therapy consisting of vanc/cipro/zosyn on [**6-29**].
He had several bronchoscopies in the ICU showing a combination of mucous plugging and evidence of pneumonia.
He continued to intermittently have episodes of mucous plugging requiring return to ICU then step down unit and back to the regular surgical floor.
GI: He underwent PEG tube placement on HD 3, he was started on tube feeds (Replete with Fiber) which were advanced to goal without difficulty.
On POD 2 from the PEG placement, routine CXR showed large amount of pneumoperitoneum (he also spiked a temperature and showed signs of consolidation.
His tube feeds were held and a tube contrast study was performed to rule out malposition or contrast extravasation and it was negative.
As a result, an ID consult was obtained and recommended echo, renal ultrasound and ophtho exam to rule out complications of fungemia.
His ECHO showed no definite vegetations and normal EF%.
