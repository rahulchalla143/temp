HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 year old man with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, with ejection fraction of 25%, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, who presented to an outside hospital on [**2179-3-25**], after sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pressure while walking.
His cardiac enzymes were slightly elevated while in the hospital and he was also diagnosed with congestive heart failure.
An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20% with global hypokinesis.
Coronary artery disease:  Status post inferior myocardial infarction ten years ago.
Congestive heart failure, with ejection fraction of 25%.
Nitroglycerin patch 0.2 mg q. a.m.; off q. p.m.  HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Medicine Service and underwent a catheterization which revealed severe left main and three-vessel coronary artery disease with a severely depressed ejection fraction of 24%.
He continued to have episodic shortness of breath with wheezing and tachycardia, which mainly would resolve with Albuterol nebulizers.
A chest x-ray was done which showed bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
The patient had chest physiotherapy at this point.
On [**2179-4-2**], a Pulmonary consultation was obtained for the episodes of shortness of breath and wheezing.

The impression was that he had normal vocal cords and a wide open glottis and they suggested evaluating for dynamic upper airway obstruction below the level of the vocal cords.
Over the next few days, he continued to have episodes of audible expiratory wheeze.
He was also slightly confused at this point.
On [**2179-4-4**], he underwent a bronchoscopy which showed a normal oropharynx, normal larynx, no endobronchial lesions, mild dynamic clots at the level of the main stem.

A Cardiology consultation was also obtained and they recommended to continue diuresis and give bronchodilators.
On [**4-7**], the patient had an episode of rigors accompanied by hypertension, tachycardia and mottled lower extremities and expiratory wheezes bilaterally.
