He was brought to the Emergency Room where chest x-ray was performed which was unremarkable for infiltrate.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Restrictive lung disease secondary to kyphosis, polio.
2) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3) Bronchiectasis status post multiple pneumonias.
4) Chronic tracheostomy.
6) History of DVT in 11/92.
7) History of C. diff in 7/94.
8) Chronic pain syndrome.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
MEDICATIONS:  On admission, Methyldopa 250 mg [**Hospital1 **], Nexium 300 mg q d, KCL, Lasix 40 mg po q d, Singular 10 mg q d, Prednisone 10 mg being tapered down per script, Levaquin 500 mg, Slo-[**Hospital1 **] 300 mg q d, Tylenol #3 for back pain prn, Bactrim q d.

Abdomen soft, nontender, non distended with well healed midline scar.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 97 beats per minute, normal intervals, axis 97 degrees, right atrial enlargement, poor R wave progression, 1 PAC, T wave flattening and T wave inversion in V1 to V3, right bundle branch block appearing.
On arrival to the floor the patient was also noted to have ST depression of 1 mm in 3 and F with heart rate at 116 and blood pressure of 213/89.
Chest x-ray showed severe right kyphoscoliosis, no effusion, no infiltrate, difficult to assess heart size.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, the patient is a 51-year-old man with chronic restrictive lung disease secondary to polio and musculoskeletal abnormalities, COPD, on chronic ventilation through a trach, presenting with increased congestion and low grade fevers.
At the time of admission he was not symptomatic, however, his EKG showed ST depressions in leads 3 and F.  For his hypertensive emergency the patient was started on Labetalol with normal elevation of his blood pressure to 120's and reversal of EKG changes to baseline.
In addition, patient was ruled out for myocardial ischemia with serial CKs and troponin which were normal.
Pulmonary:  The patient did present with congestion and shortness of breath.
He did not appear to be in congestive heart failure and there was no evidence of pneumonia on his chest x-ray.

Prophylaxis during this hospitalization.
