Admission Date:  [**2104-12-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2104-12-14**]   Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 2470**] is an 84 year-old gentleman with an unknown past medical history as he has never seen a physician in the past who, on the day of admission, developed sudden onset of chest pain at rest.
He described the pain as substernal chest pain radiating across his chest and between his shoulder blades.
He denied fevers or chills, congestion, cough, no GI symptoms.
He denies prior history of chest pain as well.
The patient arrived at an outside hospital Emergency Department approximately forty minutes after his chest pain began.
The chest pain continued to radiate across his chest to his back.
A CTA was done at the outside hospital that was negative for aortic injury, but the electrocardiogram showed anterior ST elevations, Qs in V1 and V2, right bundle branch block and left anterior vesicular block.
Electrocardiograms at the outside hospital involved to include ST elevation and both the anterior and lateral leads with peak ST elevations of 6 mm in leads V2 and V3.
He had a right dominant system and left anterior descending coronary artery with a 95% thrombotic proximal and mid lesion involving the first diagonal and first septal branch.
His left circumflex had an 80% mid lesion and his right coronary artery had a 40% mid and 60% posterolateral lesions.
For intervention the patient had Angioject and stent to the left anterior descending coronary artery without complications.
Hemodynamics in the cardiac laboratory showed a cardiac output suppressed at 3.10, a low index of 1.67, PA pressure of 31/18 with a wedge pressure of 22, the A wave being 23 and the V wave being 28, and a right ventricular pressure of 32/8.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
His wife suffers from dementia and lives in a nursing home.
Difficulty to hear over diffuse lung, rhonchi and crackles.
Lungs diffuse crackles bilaterally.
Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Cardiovascular:  The patient had a very large anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction.
For management of his coronary artery disease he was started on aspirin, Plavix and he was placed on Integrilin for a total of 18 hours.
This was titrated up to 25 t.i.d., however, the patient had problems with hypotension and orthostasis, therefore this was decreased to 12.5 t.i.d.
Post cardiac catheterization the patient's anterior and lateral ST elevations did resolve with flattening of the ST segment.
Pump function:  The patient was noted on bed side echocardiogram after his cardiac catheterization to have severe increase in his ejection fraction with a estimated EF of 20%  The patient had a formal echocardiogram on the [**5-10**] that showed an ejection fraction between 20 and 30%.
Focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
Left ventricular cavity size was said to be normal with severely depressed severe hypokinesis of the anterior septum and anterior free wall, moderate hypokinesis of the inferior septum and lateral wall and akinesis of the apex.
Based on these results the patient was started on intravenous heparin for the risk of left ventricular thrombus with such an akinetic ventricle including the apex.
However, as it was discovered that the patient had baseline dementia per family report and he subsequently suffered from an episode of delirium it was felt that the atrial fibrillation did not outweigh the risk the patient had of falling.
His chest x-ray, which had initially showed failure cleared after diuresis and the patient required no further dosing of Lasix.
His urine and serum were negative for ketones.
The hemoglobin A1C was checked that came back at 12.7 indicating the patient had diabetes undiagnosed for quite some time.
To rule out causes of delirium the patient had blood cultures times two, urine cultures and analysis and a chest x-ray.
It was concluded that the most likely cause of the patient's delirium on top of his baseline dementia were hypotension and hyperglycemia.
Therefore as stated under Cardiovascular the patient's Captopril dose was decreased to prevent orthostasis and he was put on a tight glucose control regimen including Glucophage, NPH and regular insulin sliding scale.
