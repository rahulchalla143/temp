Paradoxic septal motion consistent with prior cardiac surgery.
AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Dilated ascending aorta.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.

Compared to the previous tracing of [**2179-5-14**], except for the rhythm and taller voltage in the lateral precordial leads, no diagnostic interval change.
He had episodes of ectopy that progressed to runs of ventricular tachycardia and received bolus of lidocaine with short resolution, with reoccurance was bolused with amiodarone and EP was consulted.
Pain medications were adjusted to control pain without oversedation which was achieved with dilaudid.
He contined to have episodes of NSVT and was started on sotalol per EP service recommendations with lopressor.
