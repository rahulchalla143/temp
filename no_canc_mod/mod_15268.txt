On arrival to the MICU, the patient was complaining of abdominal pain, but was hemodynamically stable.
# Acute Pancreatitis: The patient presented with had epigastric pain was found to have an elevated lipase an abdominal CT notable only for chronic colitis.
Her pain was controlled with her home dose of oxycodone with dilaudid IV for breakthrough pain.
Additionally, Rheumatology was consulted and expressed concern that her symptoms may actually be due to vascutilits in the GI tract, given the findings on CT and history of prior vasculitic event whcih led to amputation of the distal phalnyx on 3 fingers on her right hand.
They also felt that is possible that recent changes in her dose of topomax may have contriubuted to the deveopment of disease, so this medication was discontinued.
Other etiologies, including infection, cholycystitis, and peptic ulcer disease were considered.
She was initially treated empirically for infection with zosyn and flagyl, which was discontinued after 3 days because the patient remained afebrile during this admission and did not have a leukocytosis.
She was found to have a wound on her right thumb.
X-ray of the thumb found no evidence of osteomylitis.
Plastic surgery was consulted and debrided the wound on [**8-15**].
#Hypertension: Her home anti-hypertension regimen was intitially held due to concern for hypovolemia secondary to acute pancreatitis.
#Hx of chronic back pain secondary to tarlov cyst: She is on large doses of narcotics at baseline.
We continued her home oxycodone and intiated treatment with dilaudid IV for breakthrough pain.
She was started on a CIWA protocol, but this was discontinued after 2 days due to lack of withdrawal symptoms.
# Allergic rhinitis: Chronic, but stable currently.
