History of Present Illness: 78F w/ DM & chronic afib on anticoagulation & h/o open cholecystectomy in [**2131-6-22**] c/b chronic pancreatitis c/b pseudocyst.
She has had multiple hospital admissions for these complications, most recently in [**2131-11-22**] to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP w/ sphincterotomy and sludge extraction on [**12-20**].
At that time, her ERCP showed CBD dilated to 12mm, a 5 mm stone in bile duct, which was extracted, and small pancreatic duct w/ multiple side branches suggestive of pancreas divisum.
She presented to an OSH on [**1-6**] for worsening abdominal pain, most likely due to her chronic pancreatitis.
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient appeared to be in significant amount of epigastric abdominal pain and had 200cc of bilious emesis in additional to an episode of emesis immediately post-procedure.
Her pain had been present prior to ERCP but acutely worsened post-procedure.
She did not want to answer any further questions through the phone interpreter due to her severe pain.

In this patient status post distal pancreatectomy with fiducial seeds placed in the pancreatic bed and jejunojejunostomy in the left upper quadrant, there is a new large simple fluid collection in the lesser sac measuring 9.2 x 7.4 x 8.7 cm.
There is a new small left nonhemorrhagic pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.
Bilateral renal cysts with additional renal hypodensities which are too small to characterize.

PATHOLOGY: I.  Pancreatic neck, biopsy: Atypical ducts with abundant admixed dense fibrosis consistent with severe chronic pancreatitis; no carcinoma seen.
Pancreas, distal pancreatectomy (B-T): A.  Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia with micropapillary features and high grade dysplasia (PanIn-3).
No invasive carcinoma seen.
C.  Chronic pancreatitis, diffuse, with marked atrophy of acinar tissue, hyperplasia of islet cells, and minimal inflammation.
Pancreatic duct fluid:     NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient with history of chronic pancreatitis and chronic PO intolerance was admitted to the General Surgical Service for evaluation and treatment after attempted ERCP.
The patient was made NPO with IVF, she was continued on TPN and her pain was controlled with large amount of IV Dilaudid.
The decision was made to keep patient in hospital prior surgery secondary of pain (required large amount of IV Dilaudid) and atrial fibrillation (can't take home meds PO s/t NPO status).
Patient has a history of Afib and her Coumadin was held, Cardiology was consulted and their recommendations were followed.
Post operatively patient was transferred in ICU secondary to rapid Afib (HR 150s) and hypertension.
The patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids and TPN, with a foley catheter, IV Dilaudid and Fentanyl patch for pain control.
Neuro: The patient received IV Dilaudid and Fentanyl patch for pain control, she required significant amount of IV Dilaudid for breakthrough pain.
When tolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications with continued IV for breakthrough pain.
CV: The patient has a history of Afib and she is on PO Coumadin, Diltiazem and Digoxin at home.
She continued to have episodes intermittent bradycardia and Cardiology consult was obtained.
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
The patient subsequently voided without problem.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely watched for signs of infection.
The patient spiked fever on POD # 2, blood and urine cultures were sent.
Urine cultures were positive for Enterococcus and patient was started on IV Vancomycin x 5 days.
CT demonstrated a new large simple fluid collection in the lesser sac measuring 9.2 x 7.4 x 8.7 cm.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diabetic diet with cycling tube feed, ambulating with bystander assist, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
