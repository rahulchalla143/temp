Admission Date:  [**2133-8-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2133-8-12**]  Date of Birth:   [**2064-10-5**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction times two, (status post coronary catheterization in [**2122**] revealing 30% stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending artery, 30% to 40% lesion of first diagonal, 50% to 60% lesion to the middle left anterior descending artery, 30% to 40% lesion to the right coronary artery, 50% to 60% lesion of the middle posterior descending artery, 70% lesion of the distal posterior descending artery), hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia who now presents with a 3-day history of intermittent substernal chest pain with minimal exertion.
On the morning of admission, the patient had one episode of chest pain; described as substernal chest tightness, nonradiating in nature, not relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin, and spontaneously resolved after 10 minutes of rest.
This pain was associated with left-handed tingling, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.
He reports that this pain was similar to that he has had in the past with his heart attack.
He was taken to [**Hospital6 8283**] where his troponin was found to be elevated at 0.
[**Street Address(2) 44043**] elevations in both his inferior and lateral leads on electrocardiogram.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit around 9 p.m. chest pressure and without any other complaints.
Coronary artery disease; status post cardiac catheterization in [**2122**] revealing noncritical stenosis.
Left carotid artery stenosis.
Peptic ulcer disease.
Status post myocardial infarctions times two; one in [**2131**] and one in [**2132**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:   Mr. [**Known lastname 14301**] family history was positive for hypertension and coronary artery disease.
He had a father who died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 54.
He has a brother who had an angioplasty done at the age of 41, and he has various uncles who died of heart attacks in their early 60s.
He was not acutely diaphoretic, and he appeared to be in no acute distress.
He nares were patent, and his mucous membranes were moist.
He did have a hearing aid in his right ear present.
His neck was sunburned, but otherwise without any carotid bruits, thyromegaly, or jugular venous distention.
His cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, without any murmurs, rubs or gallops.
His abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with normal bowel sounds.
There were no hepatosplenomegaly or palpable masses.
His extremities revealed 2+ distal pulses without any signs of clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
There was no calf tenderness or unusual rashes present.
Electrocardiogram taken on [**8-10**] prior to catheterization revealed a normal sinus rhythm, with a ventricular rate at 60, left axis deviation, normal intervals, left ventricular hypertrophy, and 1-mm ST elevations in leads V1 through V3.
Cardiac catheterization on [**8-11**] revealed a right-dominant circulation with 1-vessel and branch vessel coronary artery disease.
The left anterior descending artery had mild luminal irregularities, bifurcated into a "twin" system, and did not extend to the apex.
The left circumflex had mild luminal irregularities but gave off a large branching second obtuse marginal with a proximal 50% lesion and another 50% lesion in the lower pole.
There was a 95% ostial lesion, a 30% midlesion, and a 50% lesion at the distal right coronary artery at the origin of the posterior descending artery and posterior left ventricular.
The posterior descending artery had mild-to-moderate diffuse disease with a 50% midlesion.
It demonstrated moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal chamber sizes.
The ascending aorta was mildly dilated.
There was mild 1+ mitral regurgitation.
Otherwise, there were no wall motion abnormalities, and the rest of the echocardiogram was within normal limits.
He was placed on telemetry monitoring and remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout his hospital stay without any signs of increased ectopy.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization on the morning of [**8-12**] without any complications and was transferred to the Cardiac Stepdown Unit floor afterwards.
He continued to remain on telemetry monitoring to watch for any signs of increased ectopy.
He remained chest pain free throughout his hospital course, and an echocardiogram was performed on the morning of [**8-12**] to evaluate his ejection fraction and assess for any wall motion abnormalities.
He remained afebrile with no leukocytosis during his hospital course; and, thus, no antibiotics were given.
His hematocrit remained stable status post cardiac catheterization, and his groin site was monitored closely for any signs or symptoms of hematoma or excessive bleeding.
