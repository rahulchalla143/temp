No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
No atheroma in ascending aorta.
Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Mild valvular MS (MVA 1.5-2.0cm2).
Conclusions PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2).
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the mitral position.
Trace MR, no paravalvular leak.
She received cefazolin for perioperative antibiotics.
In the first twenty four hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was extubated without complications.
She was transferred to the floor and had episode of atrial fibrillation post operative day 1 treated with beta blockers, and then started on amiodarone for reoccurrences of atrial fibrillation.
She continued to go in and out of atrial fibrillation and was started on coumadin for anticoagulation.
Last episode of atrial fibrillation [**2-26**] in the am.
