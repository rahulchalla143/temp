Admission Date:  [**2117-8-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-8-21**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2518**] Chief Complaint: stroke  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubated  History of Present Illness: This is a 87 year old woman with a history of hypertension, Parkinson's disease, dementia who was last seen talking to the family at 11.30 am.
During the CT scan patient started vomiting and moving and defecated which delayed the scan.
Weight loss during her depression that needed G-tube placement in [**2106**] when her weight dropped into the low 90.
bilateral R eye deviation.
lifts both legs off the bed briefly, no spontaneous movement of left arm or withdrawal to nailbed in left arm.
However winces to pain with left nailbed pressure.
There is a hyperdensity in the distal M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery which is consistent with a thrombus.
There are extensive subcortical, deep, and periventricular white matter hypodensities which likely represent chronic microangiopathic changes.
There is prominence of the ventricles and extraaxial CSF spaces as before, suggestive of atrophy.
No suspicious bony abnormalities are seen.
CTP [**8-8**]: There is a large area of elevated mean transit time and decreased relative blood flow involving the right middle cerebral artery distribution.
There is a smaller area of decreased blood volume predominantly involving the right anterior temporal lobe, insula, and the posterior right frontal lobe.
These findings are suggestive of right middle cerebral artery infarct with surrounding penumbra of ischemia.
Right middle cerebral artery distribution infarct with surrounding large area of ischemic penumbra.
Short-segment stenosis of the P2 segment of the right posterior cerebral artery.
Approximately 25% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery by NASCET criteria.
MRA HEAD [**8-8**]: FINDINGS: There is loss of signal of the right middle cerebral artery at the M1 segment with non-visualization of the peripheral branches consistent with occlusion.
There is a short-segment stenosis of the P2 segment of the right posterior cerebral artery.
No aneurysms or vascular malformations are identified.
MRI HEAD: FINDINGS: There is slow diffusion involving the right temporal lobe, insula, and right frontal lobe in the right middle cerebral artery distribution consistent with acute infarct.
The diffusion abnormalities are smaller in extent compared to the perfusion abnormalities seen on the concurrent CT perfusion study.
There are extensive deep and periventricular white matter T2 hyperintensities as well as T2 hyperintensities of the central pons consistent with chronic microangiopathic changes.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
No suspicious bony abnormalities are seen.
The diffusion abnormalities are smaller in extent compared to the perfusion abnormality seen on concurrent CT perfusion study.
Short-segment stenosis of the P2 segment of the right posterior cerebral artery  ECHO [**8-9**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal inferior wall and apex.
No thrombus is seen.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild/moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion  CT Head [**8-12**]: The previously noted right MCA infarct demonstrates interval evolution, now extending along the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobe.
Secondary mass effect with 9-mm sub-falcine herniation and compression of the right lateral ventricle are noted.
No evidence of transtentorial or uncal herniation or intracranial hemorrhage is noted.
The diffuse hypodensity along the periventricular white matter of the left hemisphere is suggestive of small vessel disease.
The visualized portion of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
CT Head [**8-13**]: Interval evolution of the right MCA territory infarct which now involves frontal, parietal, and temporal lobe, and causes secondary mass effect with 9- mm subfalcine herniation.
CT Head [**8-14**]: Large evolving right MCA infarct with edema and mass effect, with increased mass effect to the cistern on the right side of the pons and midbrain.
CT Head [**8-15**]: Large right evolving middle cerebral artery territory infarct, with resolution of uncal herniation and improvement in the degree of subfalcine herniation compared to the study of one day prior.
No significant short interval change in the appearance of the brain with large right MCA infarction.
These parameters were a compromise as the patient also had an MI early in the admission.
Her exam remained unchanged and her head CT showed an evolving stroke.
Given her poor functional outcome and prognosis, several discussions were had with the family.
ENDO: She was treated with SSI to maintain normoglycemia until made CMO  HEME: She remained anemic but stable.
