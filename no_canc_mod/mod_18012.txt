The patient was able to be weaned from sedation and extubated and had his apical chest tube d/c'd on post-op day 1.
Post-operatively, an aspiration pneumonitis that was noted on bronchoscopy in the exploratory thoracotomy led to oxygen desaturation and the patient was started on Levoquin.
He also had bilateral pleural effusions and was diuresed for this.
