# ESRD on HD: She underwent emergent hemodialysis following placement of the temporary catheter in the emergency department.
A social work consult was placed given history of missed hemodialysis sessions.

With abd pain, concern for lactic acidosis although pt unlikely to have ischemic bowel, especially given benign exam.
Her anion gap resolved without intervention.

Alk phos elevated but other LFTs nl, c/w prior labs.
Pt currently without TTP on exam s/p morphine although somnolent.
N/V could occur in setting of uremia although BUN only 41.
# Hypertension: Initially very high on presentation, likely due to pain.
Improved with pain control.
