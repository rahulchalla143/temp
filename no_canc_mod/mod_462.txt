He is well known to the surgical service, he has a past medical history significant for sigmoid diverticulitis s/p laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy.
Past Medical History: Past Surgical History:  Diverticulitis Post-operative abdominal collection  Past Surgical History:  [**2-28**] Laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy, c/b anastomotic leak, s/p [**Doctor Last Name 3379**] procedure Umbilical hernia repair  Social History: Smokes half a pack a day of tobacco.
No IV drug use   Family History: HTN and DM  Physical Exam: Upon admission:  98.2  102  137/89  19  98% room air  Gen: No active distress Head/Eyes: Pupils equal and reactive to light, extraocular movements intact ENT: Oropharynx clear, no jugular venous distention Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally CV: Regular rate, tachycardic Abd: Soft, non-distended, +colostomy with yellow/green output, no cellulitis, drain at right lower quadrant MSK: Full range of motion 5/5 strength upper and lower extremities, deep tendon reflexes 2+ bilateral, senstations intact Neuro: CN's III-XII intact Psych: Alert and oriented to time, place, and person  Pertinent Results: Abdominal and Pelvic CT scan [**3-29**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
Patent IVC without filling defects.
Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound [**3-29**]: IMPRESSION: 1.
No evidence of thrombosis in the deep veins of either lower extremity.
Bilateral large lobar pulmonary emboli.
Bilateral basal wedge-shaped parenchymal opacities, left greater than right, worrisome for pulmonary infarctions.
Chest X-ray [**3-29**]: IMPRESSION: New focal airspace process at the left lung base, associated with low lung volumes and prominence of the central pulmonary arteries, which may reflect pulmonary hypertension.
This likely at least in part, corresponds to the organized pulmonary infarct in the left lower lobe, in the setting of massive acute pulmonary embolism  Echo [**3-29**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CT abscessogram [**3-31**]: FINDINGS: The contrast appears to have filled some of the small bowel indicating communication of the pigtail with the small bowel.
Injection of contrast into pigtail reveals opacification of some small bowel.
Bilateral atelectasis, left more than right.

An echo demonstrated his EF > 75% with hyperdynamic left ventricular function and normal right ventricular size and motion, bilateral lower extremity ultrasound was negative for a thrombus.
HD 3, his chest pain and shortness of breath had improved, he was transferred to an in-patient nursing unit, his diet was advanced, he had good pain control with oral Dilaudid, the Heparin drip was adjusted with serial PTT's goal between 60 and 80; an abscessogram demonstrated the catheter to be in communication with the small bowel with resolution of fluid collections.
HD 13, his INR was therapeutic at 2.1, the Heparin drip was discontinued, he was tolerating a regular diet, remained afebrile, ambulating independently, and oxygenating well on room air.
