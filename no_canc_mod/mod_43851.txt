CT head without contrast [**2162-11-1**]: FINDINGS: There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or acute large territorial infarction.
The extra-axial spaces are prominent, consistent with age-related atrophy, though small bilateral subdural hygromas may also be present.
There is periventricular white matter hypodensity consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is a small amount of fluid in the right sphenoid sinus.
There is no fracture.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Age-related atrophy and chronic small vessel ischemic changes.
CT C spine without contrast [**2162-11-1**]: FINDINGS: No acute fracture or malalignment is seen.
There are multilevel degenerative changes with loss of disk space height, most significant at C5/C6.
No significant spinal canal narrowing is seen.
The included portions of the lung bases demonstrate emphysematous changes with areas of bronchiectasis and a more focal consolidation in the right upper lobe.
No acute fracture or malalignment.
Emphysema and right upper lobe consolidation better evaluated on accompanying CT of the torso of the same date.
Fibrotic and emphysematous changes within the lungs.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Right femoral intertrochanteric fracture with associated soft tissue swelling.
Surrounding musculature is asymmetrically enlarged consistent with edema and/or intramuscular hematoma 4.
Wedge compression deformity at L4, of unclear chronicity, however, is not associated with paraspinal hematoma or retropulsion of fragments, and may be chronic.
[**2162-11-4**] ECHO: ---------------- The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is partial posterior mitral leaflet flail.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2162-11-4**] Right lower extremity venous US: FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] were performed of the right lower extremity, demonstrating normal compressibility, color flow, and augmentation in the common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the right lower extremity, with limited calf vein assessment.
Dense mitral annular calcifications are noted.
Heart size is unchanged, there is persistent central vascular engorgement.
Pulmonary edema is minimally improved on the left where there is increased transparency of the lung, though is little unchanged on the right.
There is no new parenchymal opacity to suggest pneumonia.
There is no effusion or pneumothorax.
No new effusion, pneumonia, or pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 103098**] is an 86 year old gentleman with history of Afib (on coumadin w/INR=2.5), moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, history of sick sinus (s/p dual chamber pacer in [**2159**]) and CAD (EF>55% in [**8-/2162**]) presented with hip fracture s/p mechanical fall complicated by pneumonia, was in ICU for oxygen requirement, hypotension and refractory afib, transferred to cardiology floor for further management of fluid, oxygen requirement, and Afib after being stable.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient reported productive cough x3 days prior to fall.
On admission exam, was afebrile with inspiratory crackles in Right middle lobe.
CXR concerning for R-sided pneumonia, CT with right focal opacities concerning for infection.
In ED, new O2 requirement and transient hypotension (now resolved) with differential diagnosis most concerning for pneumonia, with apparently underlying lung pathology (considering amiodarone toxicity +/- COPD).
Patient received one dose of ceftriaxone at OSH and one dose of azithromycin in ED for treatment of presumptive community-acquired penumonia.
Differential diagnosis was less concerning for acute pulmonary event (no evidence of PE/pneumothorax on chest CT) vs. MI (negative Tpn, asymptomatic).
No evidence of hemorrhage clinically, with Hct stable at 38.
Currently appears euvolemic, given no JVD/peripheral edema.
Despite above, hypoxemia persisted and cardiology was consulted once TTE showed partial flail mitral valve leaflet and severe MR, which is probably sub-acute given that it was seen on an echo at [**Location (un) 620**] recently.
Cardiology recommended diuresis with afterload reduction using lasix and captopril, which improved oxygenation to 2L NC.
# Mitral regurgitation: He is likely too old and frail to have mitral valve surgery so this will need to be managed medically.
# Afib s/p pacer: His home amiodarone was initially continued.
On [**2162-11-3**], patient went into Atrial fibrillation with Rapid ventricular response with HR 120.
At other times, HR was down to 55 with subsequent drop in blood pressure.
Given his CT chest findings of bibasal fibrotic changes, pulmonary team was consulted and amiodarone was discontinued.
# Fall: Pt reports feeling lightheaded in setting of positional change.
Differential diagnosis most concerning for vasovagal reaction vs. orthostatic hypotension vs. mechanical fall.
Less concerning for acute cardiac (asymptomatic and negative tpn), no arrhythmias on EKG, no acute pulmonary (negative CT for PE and pneumothorax) or seizure (no post-ictal phase).
Head CT negative for acute process.
# Hip Fracture: S/P orthostatic fall without prodromal symptoms.
Per CT pelvis, Right femur intertrochanteric fracture with associated soft tissue swelling; no spinal abnormalities.
Pulmonary team was consulted during his stay who felt his fibrosis is most likely secondary to amiodarone.
# CAD: Currently asymptomatic.
Of note, patient with significant MR valvular disease as noted above.
# Mediastinal lymphadenopathy: Noted on CT chest [**2162-11-1**], needs 6 month follow up.
