Respiratory distress resolved.
Sepsis ruled out.
Empiric treatment for possible pneumonia now completed.
History of hyperbilirubinemia status post phototherapy.
IDENTIFICATION:  Baby boy [**Known lastname 10162**] [**Known lastname 48345**] is now day of life number 11 ex 37 and [**5-15**] week male who was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital1 188**] secondary to respiratory distress and rule out sepsis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby boy [**Known lastname 10162**] [**Known lastname 48345**] is now day of life number 11 ex 37 and [**5-15**] week infant who was admitted on [**2119-6-18**] secondary to respiratory distress and rule out sepsis.
The baby was delivered via [**Name (NI) 48346**] under epidural anesthesia to a 28 G1 P0 now 1 mother with a past medical history, which was notable for glomerulonephropathy with onset during pregnancy.
She had a high degree of proteinuria during that time.
Mom's pregnancy as noted above was complicated by nephropathy.
Betamethasone was administered on [**2119-5-15**] in case preterm delivery was necessary secondary to the maternal glomerulonephropathy.
Rupture of membranes occurred naturally and was 16 hours prior to delivery yielding a clear amniotic fluid.
There was no history of maternal fever or fetal tachycardia.
The infant received bulb suctioning and tactile stimulation and then was given blow by oxygen.
Respiratory distress was noted through approximately 30 minutes of age leading to transfer to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for evaluation and then eventual admission.
Nondysmorphic faces.
Mild nasal flaring.
Chest mildly costal retractions.
No crackles noted.
No murmur noted.
No rubs or gallops.
No organomegaly.
He had no episodes of hypotension nor hypertension.
Baby boy [**Known lastname 10162**] [**Known lastname 48345**] did have several episodes of what appeared to be apnea with oxygen desaturation noted subsequent to extubation after being treated for surfactant deficiency.
Since his respiratory distress has resolved he has had no episodes of cardiovascular instability and is discharged to home without any concerns in terms of his cardiovascular status.
Respiratory:  Baby boy [**Known lastname 10162**] [**Known lastname 48345**] was admitted in respiratory distress with grunting, flaring, retracting.
He remained on mobile CPAP until approximately midnight on the night of [**6-18**] where upon his respiratory distress increased and he was intubated and given surfactant in the early hours of the morning of [**2119-6-19**].
Subsequent to his being weaned off of his nasal cannula baby boy [**Name (NI) 10162**] [**Name (NI) 48345**] has been in room air without any difficulties and has had no need for supplemental oxygen.
Subsequent to extubation baby boy [**Name (NI) 10162**] [**Name (NI) 48345**] had several episodes of apnea or shallow breathing with oxygen desaturation, which was not accompanied by bradycardia.
At least one of his episodes occurred while he was being held by his parents.
He did, however, not have any more episodes of apnea/shallow breathing or oxygen desaturation from the point of Saturday afternoon [**6-24**] until the time of his discharge, which constitutes five days without any episodes of oxygen desaturations or altered breathing pattern.
He was not treated with any methylxanthine for stimulation of his respiratory center.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Baby boy [**Known lastname 10162**] [**Known lastname 48345**] was admitted in respiratory distress and was made NPO.
He did not feed well, however, po secondary to his degree of respiratory distress during feeds and thus was fed both po and pg during the first several days of his enteral feeds.
During his hospitalization baby boy [**Name (NI) 10162**] [**Name (NI) 48345**] had no difficulties with electrolyte instabilities nor with urine output or stooling.
Hematologic and infections diseases:  Upon admission baby boy [**Name (NI) 10162**] [**Name (NI) 48345**] was started on antibiotics secondary to his respiratory distress in the setting of a mother whose GBS status was unknown.
Secondary to his continuing respiratory distress, however, and the inability to discern whether or not his original chest x-ray was consistent with surfactant deficiency or pneumonia baby boy [**Name (NI) 10162**] [**Name (NI) 48345**] was restarted on antibiotics consisting of ampicillin and gentamicin for seven days.
As his oxygen requirement gradually reduced to 0 and he reached seven days of therapy for possible pneumonia, baby boy [**Name (NI) 10162**] [**Known lastname 48347**] antibiotics were discontinued on [**2119-6-28**].
Baby boy [**Known lastname 10162**] [**Known lastname 48345**] had some difficulty with hyperbilirubinemia reaching a peak bilirubin of 18 on [**2119-6-21**].
Thus baby boy [**Name (NI) 10162**] [**Name (NI) 48345**] is discharged to home without any concerns regarding his hematologic or infectious diseases.
