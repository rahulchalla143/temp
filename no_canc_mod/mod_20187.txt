Admission Date:  [**2165-5-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2165-5-13**]   Service:  [**Company 191**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year old man with history of coronary artery bypass graft, pacemaker, Type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who was recently admitted for acute cholangitis with failed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography attempt and biliary drain placement who returns with acute renal failure and repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
Since the patient's recent discharge he has been readmitted to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital with acute renal failure.
At the time of that admission he had a creatinine of 5.5 which was likely due to dehydration.
Since his discharge on [**4-24**], the patient has been using Levofloxacin and Flagyl for cholangitis and Escherichia coli positive blood cultures at a prior outside hospital.
During that procedure, he became hypoxic with oxygen saturation dropping into the 70s and was intubated at the time of the procedure.
Upon awakening from the sedation, the patient denied fever or chills.
The patient also denied abdominal pain but did report prior right-sided pain which had not recurred.
The patient denied any urinary symptoms.
The patient did report some dysarthria and memory difficulties which were still present but improved since the last admission.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft 15 years prior.
Pacemaker secondary to bradycardia.
Question of aortic stenosis.
History of transient ischemic attacks.
Acute renal failure.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Extremities revealed 2+ bilateral lower extremity edema and also revealed swelling diffusely in the right upper extremity, good pulses throughout.
Chest x-ray had a question of left lower lobe infiltrate versus atelectasis but chronic in appearance since [**4-16**].
Electrocardiogram revealed a paced rhythm at 120 beats/minute.
Gastrointestinal - The patient with recent cholangitis.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on this admission showed a nonbleeding 2 cm ulcer in the anterior bulb of the duodenum and also revealed an ulcerated major papilla.
The patient was continued on empiric antibiotics of Levofloxacin and Flagyl, though no further biliary cultures were obtained.
Gastrointestinal - Diarrhea, patient with diarrhea after this admission.
Acute renal failure - Patient with renal failure, likely originally due to dehydration and subsequent with acute tubular necrosis, possibly from medications received.
The patient did have a renal ultrasound which showed no evidence of obstruction for post renal cause of his acute renal failure.
The patient's urine sediment and laboratory data were consistent with components of dehydration as well as likely acute tubular necrosis.
The patient's creatinine was improving significantly at the time of discharge, however, this should be monitored carefully as an outpatient to ensure resolution of his acute renal failure.
Neurologic - The patient with some confusion and dysarthria on admission.
The patient's dysarthria was likely secondary to dry mouth post intubation and confusion possibly secondary to a recent infection and sedation.
The patient did have a head computerized tomography scan to rule out bleed which revealed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
It did show evidence for prior small lacunar infarct.
Cardiac - The patient with a history of coronary artery disease.
His aspirin was held at the time of this admission given that he had evidence of a large ulceration in his duodenum and with guaiac positive stool.
The [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and Hydrochlorothiazide were held given his renal failure.
Pump - The patient had an echocardiogram on this admission given the aggressive hydration due to dehydration and echocardiogram revealed left atrial and left ventricular dilation and ejection fraction of 30%.
It also revealed global left ventricular hypokinesis, 1 to 2+ aortic regurgitation and 2+ mitral regurgitation.
Anemia - The patient had a baseline hematocrit of approximately 34.
This decreased to 30 during this admission, likely secondary to rehydration.
In addition, the patient did have guaiac positive stools and evidence of a duodenal ulcer, given that the patient's hematocrit dropped below 30 during this admission and had a history of coronary artery disease, he was transfused 1 unit.
Right upper extremity swelling - The patient had right upper extremity swelling on admission and ultrasound showed superficial clot in the brachial and basilic vein.
The patient was not anticoagulated given the presence of ulcer on film as well as guaiac positive stools and the fact that the clot was superficial and not truly representative of deep venous thrombosis.
Diabetes mellitus - The patient was kept on insulin drip on the Intensive Care Unit.
Heme - Patient with elevated INR on admission to 6.3.
Gastrointestinal, duodenal ulcer - Appreciated at the time of scope, although this was nonbleeding during scope, the patient did have guaiac positive stools.
The patient's hematocrit although decreased during this admission likely due to hydration did not represent or suggest acute active blood loss.
Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - Patient with significant malnutrition at the time of admission and low albumin as well as evidence of Vitamin K deficiency as represented by his increased INR.
Hypoxia - Patient with hypoxic respiratory failure on admission.
The patient also may likely have significant sleep apnea as he is overweight and this should be pursued as an outpatient.
The patient's tachycardia resolved as he was restarted on his medications and oxygenations but off of the ventilator there was no evidence for pulmonary embolus.
Hypoxia secondary to respiratory failure.
Acute renal failure.
