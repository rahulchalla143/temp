Per reports, the patient was watching TV and then was found on hands and knees on the floor, but had no witnessed fall.

Radiology: [**2132-9-22**]: CHest Pa/Lat - The heart size is normal, and there is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
Previously reported patchy opacity at the right lung base has cleared in the interval with only minimal residual linear opacity remaining in this area.
However, there is a questionable new area of patchy opacification peripherally in the left lower lobe as compared to previous study.
Both lungs are clear without consolidations or effusions.
The surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures reveal severe osteopenia and degenerative changes along the thoracic spine.
There is no free air under bilateral hemidiaphragms.
Diffuse osteopenia is noted.
There is a left femoral axis venous catheter.
The patient was noted after admission to have small Hct drop form 27.7 to 23.5 for which she was given PO 1U PRBCs with appropriate bump.
ID - The patient was admitted to the MICU intubated for airway protection in setting of mental status changes after receiving morphine, but with additional concern towards aspiration given some vomiting.
The patient's chest film on admission did not demonstrate any definite infiltrates or consolidations.
However, on the evening of admission the patient did have a fever with additional temp spike to 102 the am of her operation.
The patient had a UA which was significant for small leuk esterase, many bacteria and > 50WBC.
Blood Cx drawn [**9-22**], however, grew out [**Month/Day (4) **] which eventually were determined to be Clostridia.
She remained afebrile and without elevated WBC throughout her stay once the antibiotics were started.
It is unclear whether the [**Name (NI) **] was "real" or a contaminant.
CV: Patient was mildly hypertensive, but on transfer from MICU to floor she became persistently hypotensive, with SBP 80-90.
Heart failure unlikely given nl CXR, lack of elevated JVP or LE edema, but BNP>3000.
She had some EKG changes (apparently new Q waves in the precordial leads) but was ruled out for MI.
Concern for sepsis but no new O2 requirement, not tachycardic, no fevers.
Echo done showed some diastolic dysfunction, but EF 65 and no other abnormality.
Nephrology: Patient had approximately 48 hours of low urine output in setting of above mentioned hypotension.
Urine sediment shows no evidence of ATN.
FEN: There was significant concern for aspiration PNA, and she was fed via NG tube.
In the course of a speech and swallow consult, Ms. [**Known lastname 28624**] [**Last Name (Titles) 59101**] aspirated Custard, became hypoxic and developed an additional O2 requirement (2L to 4L).
This was done without complication on [**10-1**].
Repeat TSH testing was considered but deferred given inability to interpet the findings well in an acutely ill patient.
Docusate Sodium 150 mg/15 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID:PRN as needed for constipation.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H:PRN as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
