Patient noticed increasesing dyspnea over the course of the day.
She reports a mild nonproductive cough, worsening LE edema and orthopnea without PND.
She denies chest pain, fevers, chills, palpitations and nausea.
She was also found to be hypertensive with systolics above 200.
CXR was consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
EKG demonstrated lateral ST changes and an old Q wave inferiorly.
Of note, patient was recently admitted [**3-21**] to [**2159-4-3**] for seizures, complicated by aspiration pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion and later acute on chornic renal failure.
In regards to partial seziure, this was felt to be secondary to cipro and/or cylcosporin.
Patient was note to have right lobar consolidation with associated effusion which was transudative, and negative for infection and malignant cells, and was treated with Piperacillin x 8 days.
In regards to renal failure, Cr was slightly elevated from baseline, but u/s unchanged and biopsy complicated by perinephric hematomoa, but biopsy did not show acute rejection, but did show chronic allograft nephropathy.

The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
[**4-24**] ECG: Sinus rhythm.
Poor R wave progression which is non-diagnostic.
Non-specific inferolateral ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2160-4-24**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
[**4-24**] CXR: Acute pulmonary edema; basal pneumonia not excluded.
[**4-24**] LUE Ultrasound: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left arm.
Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis are unchanged, extensive.
The patient is still in interstitial edema with multifocal opacities involving both lungs, worrisome for infectious process.
1% lidocaine was used for local pain control.
In order to minimize contrast exposure given renal failure, carbon dioxide venograms were also performed.
A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed per the [**Hospital1 18**] protocol.
A 10 mm x 4 cm Bard peripheral balloon was advanced over the Glidewire and the venous pathway from just central to the stent to the cephalic arch was venoplastied.
Next, the 6 French sheath was exchanged for 7 French and a 12 mm x 4 cm Bard peripheral balloon advanced and the same segment again venoplastied.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate post-procedure complications.
Two focal tight stenoses within the long stent which extended from the left subclavian to the SVC, one within the left brachiocephalic vein and the second at the junction of the left subclavian and left brachioceohalic vein at the site of overlapping of the two stents.
Band-like stenosis at the cephalic arch.
Post-procedural venograms demonstrate resolution of the band-like stenosis and improvement of the stenoses within the long stent.
IMPRESSION: Successful venoplasty of two focal tight stenoses within the long left subclavian to SVC stent and band-like stenosis at the cephalic arch.
Brief Hospital Course: 60F w/HCV, HTN, HL, ESRD s/p cadaveric transplant that presented with flash pulmonary edema in setting of malignant hypertension secondary to renovascular disease.
Secondary issues was left upper extremity swelling s/p AV fistulogram with successful venoplasty of two focal tight stenoses.
# Flash pulmonary edema ICU Course: Dyspnea was secondary to pulmonary edema in setting of hypertensive urgency in setting of renovascular disease and worsening renal function.
No suggestion of dietary or medication non-adherence.
CXR was consistent with volume overload given interstitial edema and bilateral effusions.
Pneumonia seemed less likely given lack of fever and leukocytosis, though given immunosupression did consider atypical infections, fungal and PCP.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] BP was treated aggressively with nitro gtt and uptitration of antihypertensives as below.
TTE on [**4-24**] demonstrated normal LV systolic function (LVEF >55%), trace AR and mild MR, as well as moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
# Malignant hypertension ICU course: SBP in 200s on initial presentation to ED.
Cardiac enyzmes trended, and trop remained stable around 0.12-0.13 in setting of worsening renal function, with flat MBs.
# Left upper extremity swelling: Patient reported several week history of left upper extremity swelling with no evidence of DVT on US.
AV fistulogram performed on [**2160-4-28**] showing two focal tight stenoses within long stent which extended from left subclavian to SVC and band-like stenosis at cephalic arch s/p balloon angioplasty with post-procedural venograms demonstrating resolution of band-like stenosis and improvement of stenoses within long stent.
# ESRD s/p transplant: Patient had recent episode of humoral rejection and admitted with dyspnea and pulmonary edema as discussed above.
# Hepatitis C: Failed IFN therapy.
- assessment of renal function on diuretic regimen and in setting of recent contrast load (50 mL).
