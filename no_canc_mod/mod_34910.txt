Coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated no angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary artery disease.
The LAD had mild diffuse plaquing to 25% in the mid-vessel.
There was slight pulsatile flow.
The high Diagonal-1 and the Diagonal-2 branches had mild plaquing.
The LCX was patent and supplied small OM1 and OM2 branches and a major, slightly tortuous LPL and distal AV groove LCX.
The RCA had minimal diffuse plaquing and bifurcated into large RPDA and RPL systems.
Resting hemodynamics revealed severe elevations in right and left sided filling pressures with a RVEDP of 24 mmHg and a LVEDP of 29 mmHg.
There was mild pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PA pressure of 42/23 mmHg.
There was mild systemic arterial systolic hypertension with a central aortic pressure of 158/76 mmHg.
No angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary artery disease.
Severe aortic stenosis.
Severe biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Mild systemic arterial systolic hypertension.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic root.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.

Recent aortic valve prosthesis.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
PERICARDIUM: Small to moderate pericardial effusion.
No RA or RV diastolic collapse.
Sgnificant, accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, c/w impaired ventricular filling.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
There is accentuated respiratory variation in mitral valve inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
The aortic root appears thickened, consistent with aortic root enlargment.

Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette relative to both the most recent prior and the pre-operative chest x-ray without evidence of CHF.
These findings could represent interval development of a pericardial effusion and a cardiac echo may be obtained for further characterization.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and improved aeration of the left lung base.
Low grade fever prompted UA which showed a UTI, Started on Cipro for a three day course.
