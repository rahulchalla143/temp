SINGLE PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There is a left-sided pacemaker with leads in standard position.
There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature.
There is an ill-defined opacity at the right base.
No pleural effusions are clearly identified.
Cardiomegaly with slightly prominent pulmonary vasculature consistent with mild congestive heart failure.
Opacity in the right lower lobe could represent vascular crowding or atelectasis, early pneumonia is a possibility.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-30**]: Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion have improved and right lower lobe abnormality has cleared, indicating as was asymmetric edema, not pneumonia.
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in their standard placements.
Transvenous right ventricular lead and a transvenous right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead are also unchanged in their positions.
URINE  BLOOD-NEG NITRITE-NEG PROTEIN-TR GLUCOSE-NEG KETONE-NEG BILIRUBIN-NEG UROBILNGN-NEG PH-7.0 LEUK-NEG   Brief Hospital Course: This is an 86 yo male with CAD s/p CABG, CHF, s/p PM who presented with worsened dyspnea/dizziness.
He complained of R sided chest pain and was placed on nitroglycerin drip.
Exam notable for elevated JVP and crackles on lung exam.
EKG revealed no ischemic changes and cardiac enzymes were within normal limits.
Further diurese overnight was withheld given the aggressive diuresis in EDHis oxygen saturation improved with resolution of his tachypnea He ruled out for MI by enzymes and lack of EKG changes.
His chest pain seemed, in part, related to anxiety and to abdominal pain (RUQ pain may have been secondary to liver engorgement from CHF).
His pain was controlled with morphine and ativan.
In summary, this is an 86 year old gentleman with CAD status post CABG, CHF, s/p BiV pacemaker admitted with CHF exacerbation.
He responded well to diuresis with lasix and ruled out for myocardial infarctionl.
CHF - Pt with CHF, unknown EF, presented with CHF exacerbation.
This is most likely due to excess fluid intake - reports drinking copious fluids over the weekend while outside in the heat.
Cardiac enzymes cylced to r/o ischemic etiology and have been negative thus far.
CAD - Pt with known CAD s/p CABG in [**2166**].
He does describe chest pain here, assoc w/ SOB and relieved by nitro, however, it is not his typical anginal pain.
Patient had an episode of sharp [**11-10**] burning substernal/epigastric pain on [**7-1**] which developed after lunch and lasted several minutes.
Patient was also feeling short of breath at the time, however, was maintaining his O2 sats at 100% on 2 L NC.
The pain seemed to resolved with belching.
Rhythm --> History of atrial fibrillation, on coumadin for anticoagulation.
Coumadin continued, however, patient gives history of multiple falls in the last 1-2 months.
Dizziness - could be related to fluid shifts/CHF, especially over the holiday weekend.
Patient is also very anxious and so a component of anxiety associated with SOB may also be contributing to symptoms.
Patient has a considerable amount of anxiety related to his physical symptoms and might benefit from counseling.
