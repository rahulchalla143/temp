Admission Date:  [**2148-1-5**]       Discharge Date: [**2148-2-12**]  Date of Birth:   [**2104-4-9**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 43 year old African-American female with a past medical history significant for severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and anxiety, who presented to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**1-5**], with one month history of progressively increasing shortness of breath and hypoxia.
Her obstructive lung disease was so bad that she was being considered a candidate for a lung transplant.
Unfortunately, none of these therapies seemed to work and the patient became increasingly acidemic.
She was placed on Bi-PAP but subsequently became increasingly tachypneic and tachycardic.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems before intubation was remarkable only for a productive cough of yellow sputum.
Asthma / chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Mitral valve prolapse.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
There is no family history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Neck was supple without any lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
Cardiac examination revealed a normal S1, S2, at a tachycardic rate, no audible rubs, murmurs or gallops.
Lungs revealed diminished air entry bilaterally with diffuse expiratory wheezes and a prolonged expiratory time.
Abdomen was mildly protuberant, soft, nontender, nondistended, with good bowel sounds and no masses.
Extremities revealed no cyanosis, clubbing, edema or calf tenderness.
Neurologically, the patient was a little somnolent but otherwise the examination was non-focal and benign.
Chest x-ray demonstrated hyperinflated lungs with flattened diaphragms but no signs of any focal infiltrate consistent with pneumonia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   In light of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, the patient was placed on high dose steroids, frequent bronchodilators and adequate antibiotic coverage with Augmentin initially.
Over time, it was attempted to wean her from the ventilator, but unfortunately as her pressure support was decreased to minimal levels, the patient would become desynchronous with the ventilator, requiring immediate paralysis for ventilation.
She was given tube feeds for nutrition and her vent settings were slowly weaned to pressure support.
For her underlying anxiety disorder, the patient was placed on an around the clock regimen of Valium with p.r.n.
Because it took a while for the patient's mental status to return to baseline off of all sedation, a head CT scan was performed to evaluate for any signs of an acute hypoxia.
Fortunately, the CT scan confirmed the presence of a pan-sinusitis but no acute cerebral injury.
For most of her hospital stay, the patient continued to have frequent intermittent episodes of tachycardia and hypertension which were most likely related to her underlying anxiety disorder.
Secondary causes of hypertension such as pheochromocytoma, carcinoid, and hyper-thyroidism were all ruled out.
The patient's renal function remained excellent throughout her hospital stay with occasional episodes of oliguria which responded well to fluid boluses.
Iron studies were checked and were found to be consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
Towards the end of her hospital stay, she developed a Methicillin Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia from a line infection.
The patient developed some diarrhea during her hospital stay as well and was ruled out adequately for Clostridium difficile toxin.
Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with failure to wean status post tracheostomy.
Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
Severe anxiety.
Anemia of chronic disease.
There she is to regain her strength in terms of motor function and respiratory muscles.
