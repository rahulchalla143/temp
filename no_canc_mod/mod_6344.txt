During this episode, he presented with worsening epigastric pain.
During the previous episode in [**Month (only) **], MRI was performed, which revealed acute pancreatitis, multiple liver cysts, gallstones, bilateral pleural effusions, and a 4-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
During this more recent episode, a CT scan was performed on [**2154-8-13**], which revealed progression of the previous pancreatitis with a new inflammatory mass, as well as a thick area of pancreatic collection.
One radiopaque stone was seen in the gallbladder with probable intrahepatic bile duct dilatation.
The patient did not have any elevations in amylase or lipase at [**Hospital3 **].
He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] on [**2154-8-16**], where he presented with right upper quadrant and right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness.
He denied any nausea, vomiting, or blood stools.
Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] has noted a 30 pound weight over the past several months, as well as decreased PO intake.
Coronary artery disease status post CABG five years ago.
History of atrial fibrillation.
4-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to IODINE AND CONTRAST DYE, WHICH CAUSE A RASH, although it does not cause any throat swelling or difficulty breathing.
THE PATIENT NOTES MENTAL STATUS CHANGES WITH MORPHINE.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems is notable for right upper quadrant and right lower quadrant abdominal pain.
The patient denies bloody stools.
There was no chest pain, shortness of breath, or cough.
He has also noted a 30-pound weight loss.
He is in no acute distress.
HEART:  Heart was regular with no appreciable murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
LUNGS:  Lungs were clear to auscultation except for decreased breath sounds at the left base.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nondistended with mild diffuse tenderness on the right.
He had hypoactive bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Extremities were without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Ampicillin and Flagyl were begun for coverage of possible GI infection.
MRI revealed focal pancreatitis with marked inflammation involving the pancreatic head and neck.
There were no appreciable fluid collections that could be drained at that time.
The MRI also revealed cholelithiasis without choledocholithiasis, multiple liver cysts, bilateral pleural effusions and ascites and no evidence of pancreatic or ductal dilatation.
Chest x-ray was suggestive of possible left lower lobe pneumonia and Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was subsequently started on Levaquin.
On [**2154-8-23**], Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] complained of worsening abdominal pain.
Noncontrast CT was performed at this time, which revealed interval enlargement of bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
It also showed increase of ascites.
There were unchanged low attenuation areas of the liver.
There was worsening stranding around the pancreas, which was consistent with pancreatitis.
Abdominal tenderness did improve over the next several days.
Ascitic fluid was tapped, which revealed white blood cells of [**Pager number **], RBC 899 with 56% neutrophils, 30% lymphocytes, total protein 3.5, amylase 15, albumin 1.3, triglycerides 18.
Cultures of the fluid revealed no growth.
Echocardiogram was performed on [**2154-8-28**], which revealed mildly dilated left atrium and severe left ventricular hypokinesis, mild AR, and mild-to-moderate MR with an EF of less than 20%.
Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was tried on small amounts of oral intake, not noted increasing abdominal pain immediately afterwards.
He was then placed back NPO except for oral medications.
On [**2154-9-4**], Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was noted to have some increasing confusion.
Head CT was performed to rule out a stroke.
Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was again transfused for decreased hematocrit.
On [**2154-9-7**], Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was noted to have tachypnea and shortness of breath.
Chest x-ray revealed increased pleural effusion.
Blood cultures were sent and chest x-ray revealed left pleural effusion versus left lower lobe pneumonia.
Due to the poor pulmonary status, Mr. [**Known lastname 40377**] was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.
The procedure was performed without complication.
He was comfortable and in no apparent distress, mildly tachycardiac.
The patient had slightly decreased breath sounds at the left lung base.

EXTREMITIES:  Extremities were without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Gallstones pancreatitis.
Poor oral intake.
Pleural effusions.
Left lower lobe pneumonia.
Low hematocrit requiring multiple transfusions.
Atrial fibrillation.
4-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm.
