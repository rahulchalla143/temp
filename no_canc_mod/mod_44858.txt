Pt hit head on ground however did no LOC.
Of note, patient was reported had a similar event a few weeks ago which was thought to be been caused by an accidental overdose of oxycodone.
Past Medical History: Hypertension Atrial fibrillation Diastolic CHF Interstitial lung disease secondary to asbestosis COPD on chronic O2 on 2L NC Seizure disorder Obstructive sleep apnea Rheumatoid arthritis Osteoarthritis on heavy narcotic use chronically Chronic low back and shoulder pain s/p laminectomy Recurrent urinary tract infection s/p left TKR in [**12-2**] s/p laminectomy and periumbilical herniorrhaphy [**12-3**]  Social History: The patient lives alone.
Limited function due to chronic pain and disability.
Family History: Non-Contributory  Physical Exam: Admission physical exam: General: Lethargic, NAD HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Bibasilar crackles with end expiratory wheezes CV: Bradycardic, irregular rate Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly GU: foley in place Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis.
Discharge physical exam: Vitals: Tm 99.0 BP 98-110/54-80 HR 65-83 RR 20 92-98% 3L General: Alert, oriented x 3, no acute distress HEENT: Sclerae anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: Supple, no LAD Lungs: Mild, diffuse wheeze but moving air CV: Irregularly irregular rhythm Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding.
Neuro: Coarse tremor of left hand.
There is evidence of mild sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease in bihemispheric subcortical and periventricular white matter.
No fractures or soft tissue hematomas.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
EKG:  [**2184-9-12**] Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
[**2184-9-14**] CXR: Pulmonary vascular congestion and dilated mediastinal veins are unchanged since [**9-12**], but severe cardiomegaly has improved and mild pulmonary edema persists.
The heterogeneity of opacification in the lungs could obscure discrete pulmonary nodules.
It is strongly recommended that conventional radiographs be obtained to make sure that what appear to be discrete opacities are instead asymmetric edema rather than nodules.
[**2184-9-16**] CXR: Vascular congestion has almost completely resolved.
There are no large lung nodules.
Opacity in the left mid lung is consistent with fluid in the fissure.
There are moderate degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
Of note, the interpretation of this radiograph is limited due to technique and apical lordotic view in the frontal radiograph.
Discharge labs: [**2184-9-16**] 05:57AM BLOOD WBC-8.6 RBC-3.05* Hgb-9.2* Hct-26.9* MCV-88 MCH-30.2 MCHC-34.3 RDW-14.5 Plt Ct-178 [**2184-9-16**] 05:57AM BLOOD Glucose-147* UreaN-20 Creat-0.8 Na-132* K-4.4 Cl-91* HCO3-34* AnGap-11  Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, diastolic dysfunction, found down at home and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with hyponatremia and altered, both of which quickly resolved in the MICU.
The patient has been transferred to Medicine for likely placement in rehabilitation given her failure after just a few hours at home.
# Altered mental status: The patient's mental status appears to have cleared by the time of her transfer to Medicine from the MICU.
The original differential diagnosis included medication-related v. head trauma v. hyponatremia (and dehydration with diarrhea) v. infection.
Head trauma ruled out by CT. No sign of infection on imaging and labs.
Hyponatremia cleared fairly quickly with normal saline.
The patient may also have used too much of her dual nodal agents, which led to bradycardia and poor perfusion.
Medication and low sodium, possibly together, the lead suspects for her altered mental status.
# Atrial fibrillation: The patient originally had bradycardia, which may have been related to incorrect medication use of her dual nodal agents.
On the medicine floor, she instead became tachycardic.
The patient had an episodes of poor rate control, for which she received IV metoprolol and diltiazem.
The patient also had two episodes of symptomatic atrial fibrillation (shortness of breath), during which she had adequate blood pressure to uptitrate her nodal blockers.
# Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count jumped to 11.6.
X-ray not suggestive of consolidation.
Given her vascular congestion, however, possible nodules cannot be seen.
Diuresis with furosemide was continued.
The patient reports chronic cough, likely secondary to COPD.
No fevers but a leukocytosis  developed.
Her respiratory status may also be a result of symptomatic atrial fibrillation or pulmonary edema, given chext X-ray with vascular congestion.
# Hyponatremia: Likely related to hypovolemia, especially as hyponatremia resolved after patient received total of 4L NS.
The patient received one dose of IV furosemide because of vascular congestion seen on exam.
# Depression: Continued aripripazole and venlafaxine.
Clonazepam was held, given recent AMS, and patient showed no evidence of withdrawal from benzodiazepine.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 **] Village - [**Location 4288**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Altered mental status Hyponatremia Atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You briefly spent time in the Intensive Care Unit, where you were found to have low sodium, which was quickly fixed.
