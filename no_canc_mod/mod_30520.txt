Given her complaints of severe back pain and drooling her family felt she had food "caught in her throat" because she had nearly identical symptoms twice in the past with prior occurrences of food impactions.
One day prior to presentation she reported noticing worsening dysphagia, increased oral secretions and  drooling.
She also began complaining of intrascapular pains near the midline of her upper back region.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 68 bpm with left axis deviation and no acute ST changes.
She was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for scoping but after a prolonged procedure she desaturated and became hypoxic with oxygen saturations in low 80s despite supplemental oxygen.
Of note, per anesthesia reports, the patient's left lung was suctioned repeatedly and noted to have copious mucous.
Ms. [**Last Name (Titles) **] brief post-operative ICU stay was remarkable for some short-lived hypotension which was attributed to heavy Propofol dosing.
Of note, during her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]/MICU course her labs included a Hematocrit drop from the mid-30s range to a Hct of 27-28 which was likely secondary to dilutional effects.
Hospital course was also notable for poorly controlled hypertension.
On arrival to the regular medical floor the patient was still afebrile and had O2 saturations of 96-97% on 2L NC.
She complained of a "sore, dry throat" which is likely from recent intubation.
Otherwise, BP was stable with 150s/60s measures and she denied any cough, chills, chest pains, palpitations, abdominal pain,nausea, emesis or diarrhea.
She was able to speak in full sentences with no distress on 2L NC and no accessory muscle use noticed.
Family History: Mother had hypertension later in life in her 50s, otherwise non-contributory.
No acute distress.
No wheezes, crackles or Rhonchi ABD: soft, non-distended, normo-active bowel sounds throughout EXT: Warm and well perfused, 2+ DP and PT pulses, no clubbing or cyanosis, no edema distally.
NEURO: CNs [**2-19**] grossly in tact, no focal sensory or motor deficits, gait deferred SKIN: no rashes, no lesions .
There was no evidence of retained food EGD [**5-11**]: food stuck in diverticulum with esophagits.
[**2154-12-6**] CXR: Air-fluid level in the superior mediastinum likely representing fluid within the esophageal diverticulum.
Minimal atelectasis at the right lung base with no acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**2154-12-6**] THORACIC SPINE XRAY: Interval progression of T11 and T12 compression fractures with 50% loss of height and no gross retropulsion.
Suspected progression of upper thoracic compression fractures as well although not well evaluated on this study.
There continues to be a small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis.
No signs of acute CHF.
Bilateral mild-to-moderate amount of pleural effusion might be remnant after previous CHF episode.
No new acute pulmonary infiltrates.
[**2154-12-10**] BARIUM SWALLOW: Esophageal diverticulum arising from the anterior mid esphagus.
Findings consistent with known history of traction diverticulum.
Markedly abnormal esophageal motility, with essentially no peristaltic activity appreciated and no clearance of barium contrast from the esophagus while in the prone position.
DISCHARGE LABS: [**2154-12-11**] 06:10AM BLOOD WBC-5.6 RBC-3.26* Hgb-10.2* Hct-29.7* MCV-91 MCH-31.4 MCHC-34.5 RDW-13.4 Plt Ct-300 [**2154-12-11**] 06:10AM BLOOD Glucose-91 UreaN-13 Creat-0.9 Na-143 K-3.5 Cl-107 HCO3-28 AnGap-12, Mg-1.6   Brief Hospital Course: # Hypoxia/Respiratory Failure: The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with known esophageal diverticulum who presented to the ED with dysphagia, drooling and chest pain secondary to food impaction.
She also had some associated shortness of breath.
The patient did not tolerate this prolonged procedure well and developed hypoxia and tachypnea.
Rigid bronchoscopy was complicated by a suspected  aspiration event at left lung as copious amounts of secretions were suctioned.
On [**2154-12-7**] a CXR showed small left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis.
She continued to recuperate well  until the morning of [**2154-12-10**] when she was noted to have worsening shortness of breath with walking and minimal exertion with physical therapy team.
She developed a new cough and rhonchi on posterior lung exam.
Given her recent intubation and complaints of a mild cough, there was concern for post-aspiration pneumonia.
Fortunately, a follow-up PA and Lateral CXR showed no infiltrates.
She remained afebrile but had a mild leukocytosis to 12 range.
Incentive spirometry was given for atelectasis prevention.
# Hypotension: The patient has hypertension at her usual baseline with average SBPs ranging from 140-170s,per family.
Soon after her food disimpaction procedure/rigid bronchoscopy she developed marked hypotension which was attributed to her propofol sedation.
A post-procedure pneumothorax was also entertained but fortunately ruled out on CXR.
She recovered soon thereafter and was extubated without complications.
# Impacted Diverticulum: The patient has a known esophageal diverticulum complicated by intermittent episodes of food impaction.
She was initially brought to the ED after developing severe back pain and drooling consistent with her previous episodes of food impaction.
As above, GI was not able to fully disimpact patient with inital attempted endoscopy.
She underwent thoracic procedure with rigid bronchoscopy /endoscopy in OR for eventual successful disimpaction.
She was ruled out for any cardiac etiology with 3 sets of cycled enzymes from [**Date range (1) **].
Maalox and low dose Morphine provided relief of her chest pains and suspected dyspepsia /gastric reflux symptoms.
Ranitidine was prescribed at time of discharge for ongoing acid reflux protection.
A more formal follow-up Barium Swallow study showed esophageal diverticulum arising from the anterior mid-esophagus, consistent with traction diverticulum.
There was markedly abnormal esophageal motility with essentially no peristaltic activity appreciated and no clearance of barium contrast from the esophagus while in the prone position.
It was felt that there was no urgent need to correct below 170s systolic given HTN chronicity.
She was given several doses of hydralazine as needed for high pressures.
# Hypernatremia: The patient had low sodium levels noted upon transfer to MICU post-operatively.
# Normocytic anemia: Appears to be a chronic issue and when trended is similar to prior levels/labs.
She had a few drops in Hct which were felt to be secondary to dilutional effects from IVFs.
No note of positive guaiac stools.
No evidence of active bleeding.
She will plan to follow-up on her anemia as an outpatient for ongoing workup with her primary care provider.

Secondary: Hypertension Compression fractures Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: At time of discharge, the patient was in good condition with no acute pain complaints, stable vital signs and improvement in her swallowing difficulty.
You were admitted with difficulty swallowing, drooling and gastric reflux symptoms.
An endoscopy or image study of your throat and esophagus was performed and your symptoms were due the lodging of some food in your esophagus.
Please return to the emergency room if you experience chills, fevers, vomiting, chest pain, palpitations, worsening cough, shortness of breath, drooling, trouble swallowing or any other health concerns.
