HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old woman with a past medical history of dementia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes, who was found unresponsive in bed by her husband at around 10:30 p.m. on the evening of admission, which was [**2192-3-2**].
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was still unresponsive and was noted to have some jerking of the right arm as well as the head.
There was urinary incontinence at the time as well.
On head CT, she did have a right thalamic hemorrhage with extension into the lateral ventricles as well as the third and fourth ventricles.
There was some hydrocephalus as well as a 5 mm midline shift.
Dementia during which her husband has been taking care of her for the last month including everything around the house like cleaning, cooking, bills, and shopping.
History of breast cancer in [**2184**] status post lumpectomy and XRT.
Peripheral vascular disease status post right leg bypass.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Her HEENT exam revealed moist mucous membranes with clear oropharynx.
There was no scleral icterus.
There were no carotid bruits appreciated.
Extremities were warm and showed no edema.
There was a grimace with pain that made the face appear symmetric.
There were no Achilles reflexes.
The prognosis of the patient's hemorrhage was discussed with the family in that the thalamic region controlled the level of consciousness, however, if she did regain some consciousness, she might be left only with a left-sided hemiparesis.
One was placed with not much CSF draining and there appeared on the CAT scan to be ample room for any potential hydrocephalus to be a problem.
On [**3-10**], she was extubated and given steroids prior to extubation to prevent laryngeal edema, but she began to have stridor, and a few hours later, the family requested that she be reintubated and this was done.
The tone has increased in the left upper and lower extremities and appeared to be less responsive to stimuli than the right.
An EEG done during the movement revealed no electrographic seizures during this.
The presumed etiology behind her inability to wean successfully on [**3-10**] was perhaps due to laryngeal edema.
Recent chest x-ray showed some atelectasis versus consolidation in the left lower lobe, which has been present throughout the hospital course, but this does not appear to be getting worse.
Fever:  The patient did have fevers during her first week of hospital course.
No specific MRSA organism was ever identified and cultures from the CSF as I mentioned were negative.
There were a couple of sputum samples showing gram-positive cocci in pairs, and on [**3-10**], the report on the Gram stain gram-negative rods and gram-positive rods 2+ and 3+, but the respiratory culture shows only sparse growth of oropharyngeal flora.
She has been afebrile now for three days, and will not require any further antibiotic treatment at this point.
In addition, it should be noted that she did have Clostridium difficile sent, which was negative as well.
She did have a central line that was discontinued, and that was sent for culture, and that is also negative for organisms.
Right thalamic hemorrhage.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Transient ischemic attacks.
Tylenol 325-650 mg/elixir per G tube prn fever or pain.
