Briefly, patient was admitted on [**2147-2-24**] with abdominal pain and guaiac-positive stool.
Patient had elevated white count with bandemia and elevated lactate, which was concerning for small bowel obstruction, ileus, or ischemic colitis.
Patient also had evidence of pneumatosis on CT.
Patient also had UTI with left lower lobe pneumonia and acute renal failure with creatinine jumping from 0.07 to 1.7.
Patient was felt to have mesenteric ischemia from low flow state.
Patient had an exploratory laparotomy performed on [**2147-2-24**] and at that time was on amp, levo, and Flagyl, which he was on from [**2-24**] to [**2-27**], and patient was taken to the SICU on [**2-24**] after exploratory laparotomy and rigid sigmoidoscopy was performed, and did not reveal ischemic bowel.
Right IJ was placed on [**2-25**] and [**2-26**], and patient had hypoglycemic episodes in the setting of poor p.o.
Patient also went into diabetic ketoacidosis and was maintained on an insulin drip.
His course was further complicated by an elevated INR unclear source.
Patient was somnolent and there is question of worsening facial droop.
Head CT was negative and MRI was not performed, and question of facial droop subsequently resolved.
Active issues when patient was transferred to the Medicine service were hypothermia, UTI, coagulopathy, acute renal failure, hypertension, CHF, diabetes type 1 complicated by hypoglycemia, pneumonia, colitis, and altered mental status.
Diabetes mellitus.
Peripheral vascular disease.
History of CHF with an EF of 40-45%.
Peripheral vascular disease.
History of anemia of chronic disease.
Esophageal dysmotility.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, clicks, or gallops.
Pulmonary:  Positive bibasilar crackles at bases.
Abdomen had good bowel sounds, soft, nontender, and nondistended with midline surgical scar clean, dry, and intact.
Extremities are free of any clubbing or cyanosis with 3+ bilateral pitting edema.
Acute altered mental status:  This is felt secondary to hypoglycemia as well as UTI.
ID:  Patient had UTI and was treated with levofloxacin for a total of 14 days, which he is to continue a course once discharged from the hospital.
Colitis:  Again, patient's colitis was felt to be secondary to ischemia.
GI was following the patient initially, and felt that repeat scopes were currently not indicated.
Hypothermia:  Again felt likely secondary to infected state.
Acute renal failure:  Felt secondary to ATN in the setting of CT scan.
Patient was maintained on fluid restriction actually and prn diuresis for a goal of negative 1 liter until euvolemia was achieved.
Patient maintained good urine output without complications.
Initially hypoglycemia was secondary to poor p.o.
Patient did have intermittent hypoglycemic episodes into the 40s in the setting of poor p.o.
CHF with EF of 40-45%.
His chest x-rays revealed that patient had decreasing pulmonary edema as well as decreasing size of pleural effusion.
His diet was then advanced to a 2-gram sodium and diabetic diet.
Patient had a speech and swallow evaluation and a video swallow, which the patient passed with no evidence of gross aspiration.
Colitis:  Again felt secondary to ischemia likely.
Stool was mildly guaiac positive.
Coagulopathy:  Patient had an elevated INR in the setting of low albumin likely felt secondary to poor nutritional state.
He is able to tolerate a 2-gram diabetic diet without evidence of aspiration.
Patient's hypoglycemia episodes have been controlled, and patient is afebrile and tolerating antibiotics.
Acute renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Urinary tract infection.
Altered mental status.
Congestive heart failure.
