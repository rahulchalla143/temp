Admission Date:  [**2191-7-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2191-7-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2137-8-4**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Compazine / Haldol / Bactrim / Ritalin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**] Chief Complaint: Chset pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with BMS x2 to LAD Tandem heart ECMO arterial line indwelling port  History of Present Illness: A 53 yo F with h/o of CAD s/p IMI ([**2183**], no PCI), CVA, HIV (on HAART, CD4 47, VL ND [**5-/2191**]), HCV, HLD, HTN, who is transferred to the CCU after cardiac cath complicated by biventricular failure hypotension and PEA arrest.
She was initially admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service [**7-21**] with substernal chest pain radiating to her back, made worse with inspiration which awoke her from sleep.
The pain did not improve and she presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
EKG showed sinus at 115, diffuse low voltage, old Q waves in inferior leads, RBBB, unchanged.
CXR showed no acute process and LENI of LLE revealed no DVT.
ECHO shows trace effusion with no tamponade.
Patient given ASA, morphine, with relief of chest pain and started on heparin gtt.
She was initially chest pain free however she developed 5/10 chest pain simliar to presentation and hypoxia to 80's on room air, and hypotension to 80's, she was placed on 6LNC with sats 100%.
She was taken for emergent cath which showed a thrombus in the LAD thrombectomy was performed and a BMS placed.
Right heart cath showed mean right atrial pressure of 32 and capillary wedge pressure 25mmhg consistent with biventricular failure.
She developed bradycarida, hypotension and PEA arrest at approximately 5:30PM CPR was initiated, she received epinephrine, atropine, vasopression and was cardioverted x1.
Chest compressions were interrupted by placement of tandem heart.
Repeat cardiac cath showed instent rethrombosis at the LAD and a second BMS was placed.
Propofol had been held for >30 minutes and patient was unresponsive and unable to contirubte further to history.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: HIV/AIDS HCV HTN ?Renal failure (in OMR though renal fx fine here) CVA CAD s/p IMI (per EKG)in [**2183**] cervical low grade SIL from core bx R DVT [**2185**] tx w/ enoxaparin  Social History: The patient reports living alone in [**Hospital1 778**] but has 3 PCA's that help her during the day and part of the night.
Family History: Mother had MI at 84.
No HSM or tenderness.
ECHO ([**2191-7-22**]): There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal and mid anteroseptal,anterior and anterolateral akinesis with basal and mid inferoseptal, inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis.
Due to poor image quality further analysis of regional wall motion abnormality cannot be performed.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
Aortic regurgitation is seen (not quantitated).
Severe tricuspid regurgitation is present.
Right ventricular pressure and volume overload (causing septal wall flattening) is no longer appreciated.
Aortic excursion has also improved  .
Cardiomegaly has improved substantially, but moderately severe pulmonary edema has worsened over the past 4/1/2 hours.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: A 53 yo F with h/o of CAD s/p IMI ([**2183**], no PCI), CVA, HIV (on HAART, CD4 47, VL ND [**5-/2191**]), HCV, HLD, HTN, who is transferred to the CCU after cardiac cath complicated by biventricular failure hypotension and PEA arrest.
# Hypotension: Pt was hypotensive when received at the ICU, and was initially maintained on norepinephrine, epinephrine, and doapmine.
Right heart catheterization showed elevated right atrial pressure and elevated capillary wedge pressure consistent with biventricular failure.
Given her increasing fluid requirements, she developed anasarca with multiple fluid filled blisters diffusely.
She developed increasing pulmonary edema leading to copious tracheal secretions.
Because of decreased urine output and continued volume overload, she was started on a lasix drip.
She became hypotensive with MAPs in the 50s and required additional norepinephrine to maintain her blood pressure.
# Cardiac arrest: Patient suffered cardiac arrest during catheterization secondary to in-stent LAD thrombus and resultant biventricular failure.
On initial presentation to the CCU, she was unresponsive on exam and met criteria for arctic cooling protocol.
Once rewarmed, she became intermittently agitated, tachypnic, fighting the vent and pulling at lines, requiring very high doses of sedation with versed and fentanyl.
# NSTEMI: Patient was admitted with elevated troponin, CKMB and no acute changes on EKG.
During catheterization, she was found to have LAD thrombus which was removed and BMS placed.
However, shortly thereafter, she developed hypotension and cardiogenic shock and was found to have developed instent thrombosis and had new BMS stent placed.
# Metabolic acidosis: Lactate level was 12.2 on arrival to the CCU, likely related prolonged cardiac arrest with end-organ ischemia.
She was started on a bicarb drip for her metabolic acidosis and required frequent adjustments in bicarb drips and her sweep to maintain adequate acid/base balance.
#HIV: HAART was held in setting of acute illness.
