Admission Date:  [**2179-2-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2179-2-25**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81 year old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease status post angioplasty, status post total abdominal hysterectomy, who presents with a several week history of chest pain worsening in frequency and duration over the last several days.
The patient describes this pain as drowning and suffocating with shortness of breath lasting five to 30 minutes.
No radiation, no nausea or vomiting; non-pleuritic chest pain.
No tearing or ripping sensation.
No diaphoresis, no orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
The patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2-9**], and had pain which was relieved with sublingual Nitroglycerin.
An EKG showed no acute ST or T changes, with atrial fibrillation at 80.
Atrial fibrillation.
Hernia repair.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, no alcohol.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died at 66 with an myocardial infarction.
Brother, at 77, had a bypass graft.
The patient is in no acute distress.
Crackles bilaterally at the bases; scattered wheezes.
Cardiac: Irregularly irregular rate; no murmurs.
No carotid bruit.
Lower extremities with mild edema bilaterally and two plus dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.
LABORATORY:  EKG showed atrial fibrillation at 66; no acute ST or T changes.
Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly without evidence of failure.
Cardiac catheterization was performed on [**2179-2-12**], which showed three-vessel disease.
At that time, it was decided that the patient should undergo minimally invasive non-bypass coronary artery bypass graft.
On postoperative day number two, it was noted that the patient had right arm weakness and confusion.
A Neurology consultation was called and a stroke was diagnosed which was most likely related to the patient's atrial fibrillation.
CT scan which was obtained after this embolic event showed a left thalamic hypodensity likely representing a subacute chronic infarction.
On postoperative day number three, the patient's chest tubes were removed and the patient was sent for a swallow evaluation.
The patient also underwent a carotid artery study which showed significant plaque through the left internal carotid artery with no focal stenosis and severe narrowing throughout the left ICA.
On postoperative day number seven, the patient underwent an MRA of her carotids which demonstrated a left ICA with total occlusion and a right ICA with 80 to 99% stenosis.
On [**2179-2-23**], a family discussion was initiated regarding plans for a PEG, however, the family wished to wait to see whether or not her swallowing would improve before placing a PEG.
