Admission Date:  [**2185-12-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2186-1-4**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88 year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft times two, congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 35%, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation status post DDD pacer placement, admitted [**2185-12-22**] with sudden onset of right eye pain at home.
She subsequently developed slurred speech and was taken to the Emergency Department via EMS.
In the Emergency Department the patient was noted to have slurred speech and a left hemiparesis.
CAT scan was negative for hemorrhage, but positive for a probable embolic right MCA stroke.
The patient developed respiratory distress in the Emergency Department requiring supplemental oxygen, Lasix and a trial of a noninvasive ventilator.
Blood pressure was elevated on admission to 160 to 180.
Symptoms of congestive heart failure were controlled with a nitroglycerin drip initially.
Neurological examination revealed complete left sided hemiplegia with decreased sensation of the left arm and a left facial droop.
A repeat head CT on [**12-22**] showed a large right MCA stroke unchanged from prior.
An increased white blood cell count was noted on [**12-22**] considered to be stress response versus evidence of infection and cultures were sent.
On [**12-22**] and [**12-23**] the patient was noted to have increased alertness complaining of a headache with an unchanged neurological examination.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft times two in [**2181**] complicated by a left ventricular aneurysm status post patched graft and third degree heart block.
History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation status post DDD pacer.
Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 35%.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.4.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The pupils are poorly reactive bilaterally, but the patient does respond to light stimuli.
There is poor response to threat bilaterally.
Neck was supple with no bruits.
Cardiovascular, regular, 2 out of 6 systolic murmur best at the right upper sternal border.
Lungs were with rhoncerous breath sounds bilaterally in the anterior lung fields.
Abdomen is soft, mild, diffuse tenderness to palpation with no rebound or guarding and active bowel sounds.
There are several small raised red lesions on the distal lower extremities.
She has a left sided visual field defect/neglect.
Urinalysis showed large blood, negative nitrite, greater then 50 red blood cells, 3 to 5 white blood cells, few bacteria and no epithelial cells.
Neurological:  The patient is admitted with a large right MCA stroke of embolic origin.
The patient's residual defects were a left facial droop, left hemiparesis and left hemisensory deficits.
There were no new focal neurological findings during this admission and there was no reimaging of the head after transfer to the floor on [**2185-12-23**].
The patient remained intermittently hypotensive and had to be bolused with fluids in order to maintain a blood pressure in the low 100s.
Despite periods of hypotension the patient's mental status remained largely unchanged.
Cardiovascular:  Patient with a history of coronary artery disease.
Captopril was added shortly after the [**Hospital 228**] transfer to the floor for treatment of congestive heart failure.
The patient was known to be prone to flash pulmonary edema as she had experienced in the Emergency Department.
After her transfer to the floor she developed increased respiratory distress over several days.
Pulmonary examination and x-ray were consistent with moderate congestive heart failure.
Following diuresis the patient became transiently hypotensive to the 70s and 80s with mildly depressed level of alertness and responsiveness.
She also maintained good urine output and was considered to be essentially euvolemic with a creatinine at or near baseline of 1.6 at the time of discharge.
On [**2185-12-27**] during one period of relative hypotension the patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation/flutter.
It was felt that this might be contributing to her difficulty breathing and to her congestive heart failure.
After adjustment of the pacemaker, the patient was in continued atrial fibrillation/flutter, but ventricularly paced at 60 beats per minute.
Pulmonary:  As noted the patient experienced mild congestive heart failure early in this admission.
She was effectively diuresed and became transiently hypotensive.
The patient also spiked a fever and while she did grow out positive blood cultures or have positive sputum specimens, chest x-ray was suggestive of a retrocardiac opacity perhaps most consistent with an aspiration pneumonia.
Although chest x-ray revealed a persistent left lower lobe opacity at the time of discharge, the patient was afebrile with no new respiratory complaints.
She should complete a fourteen day course of Levaquin and Flagyl and should be reimaged if she becomes febrile or new respiratory complaints develop.
Infectious disease:  As noted the patient was treated for a possible aspiration pneumonia with Levaquin and Flagyl.
The patient was also noted to have a urinary tract infection positive for both proteus and enterococcus.
Hematuria noted during the initial presentation to the floor resolved over time and was attributed to Foley trauma.
Hematologic:  The patient's hematocrit remained stable throughout this admission after initial drop in the MICU.
The patient should be maintained on a diet of pureed foods and thickened liquids.
She had multiple repeated loose stools.
Stool cultures were negative for clostridium difficile.
Middle cerebrovascular artery stroke with left hemiparesis.
Congestive heart failure.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Urinary tract infection.
Follow up will be scheduled with the electrophysiology cardiology team in several weeks for evaluation of pacemaker and potential override atrial pacing.
