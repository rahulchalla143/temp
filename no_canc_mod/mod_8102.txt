The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] Emergency Room for shortness of breath and tachypnea to a respiratory rate of approximately 42 per minute with vital signs at the nursing home of a temperature of 99.8, heart rate of 100 to 110, blood pressure 220/90 and 78 percent oxygen saturation on room air.
Reportedly this patient was previously being treated for a perihilar bilateral pneumonia and given Levaquin 250 mg p.o.
There was a reported episode of vomiting on the day prior to admission with desaturation of his oxygen during those times.
On presentation to the [**Hospital6 256**] Emergency Department, the patient was entered in the MUST sepsis protocol for suspected source of infection with a fever, tachycardia, tachypnea as well as an elevated lactate which on presentation was 5.7.
Dysphagia resulting from the cerebrovascular accident, now    status post G-tube placement.
Atypical psychosis.
History of Proteus back abscess, status post incision and    drainage.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
On physical examination generally, this is an ill- appearing elderly male in mild distress on 100 percent nonrebreather.
Pulmonary examination, there were rales bilaterally, left greater than right on the bases with diminished breathsounds bilaterally.
Abdominal examination was soft, mildly distended, hypoactive bowel sounds, nontender.
G-tube was intact with no surrounding erythema.
Extremities with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
The patient's skin had no rashes.
A urinalysis was done which showed moderate leukocyte esterase, 30 protein, nitrates negative, trace ketones.
Electrocardiogram on admission showed sinus tachycardia at 100 with normal axis and an old Q in 3.
Chest x-ray showed bilateral hilar fluffiness, although the patient was rotated.
There appeared to be a left lower lobe atelectasis effusion which was similar to prior chest x-ray.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit due to sepsis and the MUST protocol was continued.
Sepsis - The sepsis was initially thought to be secondary    to aspiration pneumonia, given the patient's reported    history of aspiration pneumonia and his altered mental    status and hypoxia.
Therefore it was felt that there was a    urinary source of the sepsis as well as possibly an    aspiration pneumonia source.
Given the patient continuing spike    through antibiotics, as well as having acute renal    failure, a renal ultrasound was done which demonstrated    right hydronephrosis with multiple nonobstructing stones    in the right kidney as well as a left renal cyst.
A computerized axial tomography scan done on [**4-1**] showed    an 8 mm obstructing right proximal ureteral calculus with    marked proximal hydroureter and hydronephrosis, bilateral    renal calculi, bilateral renal cysts with a right renal    cyst containing calcification, descending thoracic aortic    aneurysm and cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
For    this problem, Interventional Radiology was consulted and    on [**2141-4-2**], they placed a percutaneous nephrostomy    tube with initial serosanguinous drainage.
As far as the sepsis goes, placement    of the nephrostomy tube helped relieve the infection in    the right kidney caused by the obstructing ureteral stone    and the patient defervesced with minimal fevers and no    signs of worsening sepsis after the nephrostomy tube was    placed.
Renal issues - As noted above, the percutaneous    nephrostomy tube was placed at midnight for the Proteus    sepsis for the obstructing ureteral stone.
For this issue, a repeat    computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was done which    showed a perinephric hematoma as well as signs of    retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Also, for his renal issues, as far as the    overall management of the right ureteral stone, Urology is    following to consider stenting versus lithotripsy of the    stone at some point down the road.
There is also some    notation of a mass within the right kidney for which    Urology is following.
The patient's acute    renal failure resolved after the nephrostomy tube was    placed, returning to a baseline creatinine of    approximately 1.2 by discharge from the Medical Intensive    Care Unit.
Transaminitis for which no cholecystitis or right upper    quadrant pathology was shown.
Respiratory insufficiency - There is question of    aspiration pneumonia versus just aspiration.
The patient    was continued on pulmonary toilet aspiration precaution    treatment of a potential pneumonia and treatment of    sepsis.
It was thought that more so just the treatment of    the overall sepsis improved hypoxia and that there was not    likely to be an aspiration pneumonia.
Hematologic - This patient's anemia continued for which    the patient was taken to Interventional Radiology for    embolization of the bleeding vessels within the right    kidney, status post percutaneous nephrostomy tube    placement.
The patient required embolization of some bleeding vessels within the right kidney due to a large perinephric hematoma resulting from the placement of a right nephrostomy tube.
The patient will continue to be followed by Urology for the continuing obstruction of the right ureter due to an 8 mm ureteral stone.
