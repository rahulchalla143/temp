Admission Date:  [**2166-12-19**]              Discharge Date:   [**2166-12-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2144-9-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Allergies/ADRs on File  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**] Chief Complaint: Fall and loss of consciousness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: lumbar puncture  History of Present Illness: This is a 22 year old male with past medical history significant for anxiety and a previous cardiac work-up at the age of 16 for "conduction abnormalities" presenting with an episode of chest pain followed by loss of consciousness and s/p a fall down a steep flight of stairs in his apartment building.
He states that he was in his usual state of health when he suddenly felt a sharp, substernal chest pain that radiated across his chest bilaterally, and felt unwell.
He does not describe any palpitations, diaphoresis, warmth, or lightheadedness prior to the event.
Denies any new medications other than citalopram, which he has been taking for the past few months.
He does describe occasional "regurgitation" of food and he report being diagnosed with a hiatal hernia in the past.
No report of past esophageal studies.
Per his pediatric cardiologist from previous notes in [**2162**], TTE showed a structurally normal heart with good contractility, without cardiomyopathy, MVP, or pulmonary hypertension, and normal stress test.
Double contrast esophogram in [**2162**] shows hiatal hernia, no evidence of dysmotility.
Positive gliadin antibody, but no evidence of celiac sprue.
CT were negative for traumatic pathology, but he required paralytics to get through CT. LP unremarkable, with normal protein/glucose/WBCs.
Neuro was consulted and report intact brainstem reflexes, limited ability to follow midline and appendicular commands, symmetric, purposeful movements of the extremities, and quite brisk reflexes at the patella.
D-dimer sent and returned elevated at 551.
On the floor, he complains of bouts of shortness of breath, described as like being under water.
Past Medical History: Anxiety ?cardiac conduction abnormalities hiatal hernia   Social History: MBA student at [**University/College 82741**].
[**Name2 (NI) **] seizure disorders in the family  Physical Exam: VS: T 99.0, BP 124/84, HR 68, RR 18 and 100%RA GA: AOx3, NAD HEENT: PERRLA.
no LAD, no JVD, neck supple.
Cards: RRR, nl S1/S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs.
Pulm: CTAB, no crackles or wheezes Abd: soft, NT/ND, +BS.
MICROBIOLOGY: Blood cultures x2: no growth to date Urine culture: FINAL - no growth CSF culture: FINAL - no growth .
IMAGING / OTHER STUDIES: CXR ([**2166-12-19**]): IMPRESSION: No acute traumatic injury is seen within the chest.
CT head ([**2166-12-19**]): IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis ([**2166-12-19**]): IMPRESSION: No acute traumatic findings within the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
MRI head w/ and w/o contrast ([**2166-12-20**]): IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial abnormalities.
EEG ([**Date range (1) **]): no epileptiform changes, unremarkable .
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %) consistent with a cardiomyopathy.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 22 year old male with history of anxiety and ?cardiac conduction abnormalities of unknown significance presents s/p fall and LOC after an episode of profound, non-exertional chest pain and tightness.
On echo, he was found to have a depressed EF of 45% and global ventricular dilatation.
Chest pain: His pain did recur once during admission, but did not result in loss of consciousness.
It was not associated with any shortness of breath or diaphoresis.
He did explain a previous history of "regurgitation" when eating, with an esophageal study in the past, only showing a hiatal hernia and no apparent dysmotility.
He is somewhat anxious at baseline and a Psychiatry consult was called to help assess any pscyhiatric causes of his chest pain (i.e.
panic attack), but they did not indicate any.
An echocardiogram was recommended by the Cardiology team and it showed an ejection fraction of 45% and global dilatation of the ventricles.
He will be followed closely by the electrophysiology team as an outpatient with cardiac MRI and follow-up appointments to further explore this structural abnormality and work-up this apparent dilated cardiomyopathy.
We also recommended following up with Gastroenterology to investigate his regurgitation symptoms and have set up an appointment for him at [**Hospital1 18**].
He understands that we are still not sure as to why he lost consciousness and knows that it will be important to continue seeing the cardiologists to manage and work up his suspected cardiomyopathy and visit Gastroenterology to address his regurgitation symptoms.
)(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Cardiomyopathy, based on echocardiogram results Vasovagal syncope  Secondary diagnosis: Anxiety Hiatal hernia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
An MRI of your brain was done and it was normal without evidence of stroke or focus of seizure.
An EEG was performed and there was no evidence of seizures.
We performed an echocardiogram, which showed an abnormal reduction in the heart's pumping ability, which will require further evaluation with the cardiologists.
Medication changes: 1) You should START omeprazole 40mg daily to help with your reflux symptoms.
The second appointment is with a gastroenterologist to help you with your regurgitation symptoms.
