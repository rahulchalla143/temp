He initially presented to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Street Address(1) 42301**] Clinic on [**2173-3-25**] complaining of weight loss, intermittent fevers and fatigue.
The patient then presented to the emergency room on [**4-9**], complaining of diarrhea and fevers, fatigue at home, fever and chills, watery diarrhea, with no blood and occurring up to three times per day.
He denied any nausea or vomiting.
He had some mild abdominal discomfort.
He also complained of generalized weakness.
He denied any urinary symptoms.
In the emergency room, the labs showed elevated LFTs as well as amylase and lipase.
He had an abdominal CT, which showed peripancreatic multiloculated fluid collection.
Retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and colonic ileus.
Recent visit to [**Country 6257**] in [**2173-1-22**] for abdominal pain and retesting of HIV status.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
GENERAL:  The patient is alert, no acute distress.
NECK:  Supple with no apparent cervical adenopathy.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm, tachycardia, no murmur.
Left lower quadrant tenderness with voluntary guarding, no rebound.
EXTREMITIES:  Thin, no edema, warm, small left axillary lymph node.
Bilateral inguinal adenopathy, left greater than right.
Urinalysis:  Moderate blood, trace protein, no white blood cells or red blood cells.
Hepatitis C virus antibody negative.
Chest x-ray in the emergency room showed clear lungs with dilated loops of bowel.
EKG:  Sinus tachycardia with a rate of 140, normal access, normal intervals, T-wave flattening in leads 1 and AVL.
No comparison EKG available.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Initially, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit because of his profound dehydration.
The focus of his clinical care was initially on his pancreatitis, given his elevated amylase and lipase, elevated transaminases, tender abdomen, and peripancreatic-fluid collection seen on CT examination.
However, upon transfer from the intensive care unit, further history taking revealed that the patient gave a history very suspicious for tuberculosis given his 30 pound weight loss over the past three months, night sweats, fevers, and chronic cough.
The patient was then placed on precautions and subsequently found to have disseminated tuberculosis.
He had further workup for possible tuberculosis including a repeat chest x-ray, which was suspicious for an atypical pneumonia and a chest CT, which showed multiple tiny nodules very suspicious for miliary tuberculosis.
This showed moderate AFB and subsequently this organism was identified by the state laboratory as mycobacterium tuberculosis.
The patient continued having fevers for the next week or so.
However, the patient then started having very high fevers, as high as 104, which was thought to be a paradoxical reaction to the antibiotics.
He also had a bronchoscopy done on [**4-21**], for bronchial lavage.
The lavaged specimen was negative for AFB, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] fungus for bacteria at the time of this dictation.
This showed acid-fast bacilli on staining.
He also had E coli sensitive to Ceftriaxone in his urine.
The patient had initially been taken off his Bactrim prophylaxis due to his elevated transaminases, however, this was restarted once the transaminases gradually came down.
The patient had HIV genotyping done as a baseline before starting heart therapy.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Pancreatitis with peripancreatic fluid collection.
Transaminases gradually came down after a small bump after starting RIPE therapy.
He will have a follow up abdominal CT scan to re-evaluate his peripancreatic fluid collection prior to discharge.
The conclusion of which was that there was no identifiable cause for the pancreatitis or elevated LFTs other than the disseminated tuberculosis.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient had a pancytopenia on admission, which gradually worsened.
The lymph node biopsy was negative for lymphoma.
PULMONARY:  The patient briefly had an oxygen requirement of four liters oxygen saturation via nasal cannula at the time of his diagnosis of tuberculosis.
He was also noted to have bilateral pleural effusions.
The patient was continued on maintenance IV fluids due to continued dehydration due to high fevers and poor p.o.
VASCULAR:  The patient was found to have a right common iliac clot on the abdominal CT.
Bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds were done to rule out DVTs of the lower extremities.
