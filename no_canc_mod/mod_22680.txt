No focal airspace consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion is noted.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
HEAD CT WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no new site of hemorrhage.
There is extensive encephalomalacia in the parietal lobes bilaterally as well as in the right occipital lobe.
There is no significant shift of normally midline structures.
The angulation of scan is different from the study from [**2191-4-12**], but there is likely no significant change.
No abnormal enhancement is seen to suggest infection.
The left ethmoid sinus demonstrates fluid density in a round configuration which is continuous with anterior cranial fossa and therefore meningocoele is not excluded.
No new site of hemorrhage, edema or mass effect.
Similar appearance of multiple fractures and bullet fragments.
Extensive encephalomalacia in right occipital/both parietal lobes.
Persistent left greater than right mastoid air cell opacification.
CT brain FRI [**2191-6-3**] 2:29 PM Expected post-op change after right frontal cranioplasty w/o other short-interval change.
PFI AUDIT # 1   Final Report HISTORY: 26-year-old male with right frontal cranioplasty, evaluate for postoperative change.
HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There has been interval right frontal cranioplasty, with replacement of calvarium at site of prior defect.
There is minimal expected subcutaneous gas at the site of cranioplasty, and a tiny extra-axial hemorrhage, not unexpected (2:19).
The study is otherwise unchanged, with extensive encephalomalacia in the parietal lobes and right occipital lobe.
Again noted is a left ethmoid sinus opacification, which appears continuous with the anterior cranial fossa, and therefore meningocele is not excludable; CT facial bones previously suggested.
IMPRESSION: Status post right frontal cranioplasty with expected  post-operative appearance and without other short interval change.
He underwent a video swallow and the results oropharyngeal dysphagia at this time including silent aspiration of thin liquids and prolonged mastication of solids.
