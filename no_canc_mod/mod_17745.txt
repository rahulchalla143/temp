Of note patient also with recent seizures since [**12-4**].
Recent swall eval with micro aspirations with thin liquids, and the patient has been on nectar thick liquids.
In the ED the patient was noted to be hypothermic (Temp 33C) and mildly hypotensive 70's-90's.
CT torso with multilobar pna but without evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
She was admitted to the intensive care unit, at which time she denied fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, dysuria.

There are more dense mixed consolidative and ground glass opacities in the lower lobes and within the right middle lobe.
Trace pleural effusions.
There are multiple prominent but relatively small mediastinal lymph nodes up to 7 mm in shortest dimension.
Mild prominence of the central hepatic bile ducts without definite intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
There is no definite surrounding inflammatory change, however, and no radiopaque stones are visualized.
The pancreatic head is poorly visualized but appears perhaps slightly enlarged and may have a double duct sign raising at least the suspicion of an underlying mass.
Particularly the right kidney is highly atrophic, but there is also left renal cortical thinning.
There are vascular calcifications noted but no aortic aneurysm.
There is extensive involvement of the left ischium with Paget's disease and lesser involvement of the left ilium.
There are posterior osteophytes from the level of T12- L1 through L3-L4.
[**2-4**] CT head w/o contrast: There is no intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus.
There are periventricular white matter hypodensities most consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
There are small lacunes within the right cerebellar hemisphere.
There is an air-fluid level in the right maxillary sinus with adjacent mucosal thickening.
This fluid is of high density and could represent inspissated secretions vs. blood.
No facial fractures are identified on these limited images.
[**2-4**] CXR: : Bibasilar opacities concerning for pneumonia.
No congestive heart failure.
No pleural effusion.
[**2-4**] CT C spine: No acute fractures or dislocations.
Multilevel degenerative changes with at least moderate spinal canal narrowing at C4-5 due to osteophytes and a central disc protrusion.
[**2-5**] U/S: : Dilated gallbladder with stones in its lumen.
No ericholecystic fluid, gallbladder wall thickening, or son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign.
Intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation.
The pancreas and pancreatic duct are not well assessed.
[**2-10**] CXR: Moderate right and small-to-moderate left pleural effusions are unchanged.
Bibasilar consolidation is present and slightly worse on the left in the interval.
Multifocal poorly defined upper lobe opacities have slightly worsened and likely correspond to areas of bronchocentric opacification on recent CT torso.
The constellation of findings is most consistent with a multifocal infection.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
At least mild aortic valve stenosis is present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-31**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Significant aortic valve stenosis - ?mild.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular  systolic function.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] year old female presents with GI bleed in setting of elevated INR and hypothermia/hypotension, found to have a multilobar aspiration pneumonia..  1) GI bleed/acute blood loss anemia: This was most likely an upper source, given melena, in the setting of markedly elevated INR 22.
2) Sepsis due to aspiration pneumonia: In the ICU, the patient was fluid resuscitated and covered with Zosyn/vancomycin with stabilization of blood pressure.
She had a speech and swallow evaluation, which recommended soft diet/thin liquids with no mixed consistencies.
3) Bilateral pleural effusions/CHF: The patient developed bilateral pleural effusions, noted on chest X-ray [**2194-2-7**].
Given suspicion for fluid overload, she was gently diuresed with IV Lasix without significant change in size of effusions.
This may have been related to consumption from GI bleed versus sepsis-related bone-marrow suppression.
5) Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to have significant pauses on telemetry, however, she did not desire a pacemaker.
6) Seizure disorder: The patient has not had a seizure in over 2 weeks and recent EEG was without epileptiform activity.
There had been concern that, given her history of cancer, she could have a metastatic focus in the brain that may have triggered her prior seizures.
8) Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine improved to 1.3 from 2.2 on admission with hydration.
The acute renal failure was most likely due to ATN in the setting of sepsis.
The patient does not desire treatment or further diagnostic testing.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) neb Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
