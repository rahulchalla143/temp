MRI brain: No definite evidence of acute brain ischemia.
Chronic small vessel infarction  EEG: abnormal portable EEG due to prominent focal slowing and some sharp components in the left temporal region.
This suggests a marked focal subcortical dysfunction in that area.
A stroke would be a common explanation.
The sharp features indicate an are of cortical hypersynchrony and could be related to focal-onset seizures, but they were not diagnostic of seizures.
There was no evidence of ongoing nonconvulsive status epilepticus   Brief Hospital Course:   Ms. [**Known lastname 88343**] is [**Age over 90 **] y/o woman with a past history of dementia (though her son says she is usually pretty sharp and only required placement in a nursing home about 1 month ago after she was getting recurrent UTIs and delirium) who lives at [**Location **] and was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation form OSH for a seizure.
There were no focal lesions noted on brain imaging, but there was diffuse white matter disease noted related to small vessel infarcts; the imaging was consistent with Binswanger's disease.
The EEG showed prominent focal slowing and some sharp components in the left temporal region, suggesting a marked focal subcortical dysfunction in that area.
For this reason, she should be maintained on Keppra for seizure control.
While she was in the hospital, she developed atrial fibrillation.
However, this can be considered starting in follow-up if the benefits are determined to outweigh the risks (low fall risk and seizures well controlled).
6. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Cape Heritage, A [**Hospital 671**] HealthCare Center - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: seizure Binswanger's Disease atrial fibrillation  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You were initially intubated for protection of your airway, but after you became more alert, you were extubated without difficulty.
An MRI of your brain was performed and showed diffuse white matter disease, likely due to small strokes (this is called Binswanger's disease).
The exact etiology of your seizure is unknown and most seizures have no clear etiology, what is reassuring is that there were no focal brain lesions found on MRI that could cause a seizure.
An EEG was also performed to assess for seizure activity, this did not show any seizures but did show prominent focal slowing and some sharp components in the left temporal region indicating that there is a potential for seizures to begin in this region.
Given the increased stroke risk with this irregular rhyhthm, you were also started on a baby aspirin to help prevent strokes as well as continued on the Plavix, which you were previously taking.
Also, while you were here, your Remeron and Risperidal were stopped given their possible side effect risks.
