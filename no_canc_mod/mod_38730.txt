Patient was initially transferred from an OSH with severe gallstone pancreatitis and multiorgan failure with ARDS, acute renal failure requiring dialysis and a CT showing necrotizing pancreatitis with development of a pseudocyst.
At [**Hospital1 18**] he was managed initially in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], and his course was complicated by cholangitis requiring ERCP that was unsuccessful to cannulate the CBD given the severe inflammation compressing the duodenum and a PTC was placed on [**2185-9-30**].
He developed a large pancreatic pseudocyst requiring operative drainage and in [**2185-10-18**] he underwent a RNY cyst jejunostomy, SBR, cholecystectomy and umbilical hernia repair.
Postop he required a tracheostomy given respiratory failure and unable to wean from the vent.
Past Medical History: PMH: - Diabetes - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Nephrolithiasis - Vertebral disc disease  PSH: - [**2185-9-30**] percutaneous biliary drain - [**2185-10-18**] Open pancreatic debridement.
Roux-en-Y pancreatic cyst jejunostomy.
Umbilical hernia repair.
ABD: Soft, mildly distended, nontender, no rebound or guarding, normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses Wound clean dry intact with sterile strips placed.
No induration, erythema or drainage DRE: normal tone, macroscopic melena.
+guaiac Ext: No LE edema, LE warm and well perfused   Pertinent Results: 134  98  52 -------------< 132 4.9  29  2.2  ALT: 101 AP: 852 Tbili: 2.5 Alb: 2.2 AST: 136 Lip: 18  11.8 > 25.5 < 321   N:59 Band:6 L:14 M:7 E:1 Bas:0 Metas: 7 Myelos: 5 Other: 1  NGT lavage: no evidence of blood, clear saline  Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the West 2A surgical service in the ICU for management of his GI bleed.
Upon admission to the TSICU patient underwent an EGD that was positive for a large gastric ulcer with no evidence of active bleeding.
Patient had some transient hypotension during his second night overnight, responsive to fluid boluses.
On [**11-24**] a Cholangiogram was performed showing some filling defects of biliary tract, consistent with clots, without visible communication with hepatic arterial, venous or portal vessels.
A bedside debridement of his sacral decub ulcer was performed as well, with some necrotic tissue, but no purulent drainage or signs of active infection.
He had frequent episodes of melena and required 2U of RBCs.
On [**11-27**] patient had episode of mild hematemesis along with some melena and some blood from biliary drain.
A CTA of abd/pelvis showed no active extravasation and some mild thickening of the jejunum.
This finding along with a Hct drop from 30 to 25, made us ask GI to do another EGD on [**11-27**], which showed the same large ulcer, that was actually in the duodenal bulb with no signs of recent bleeding.
Given significant NGT trauma seen, this was taken out with no nasointestinal tubes for 24 hrs.
Given that the LFTs continued to improve and the biliary drained started to put out minimal bilious output and no more bloody output, the PTC was capped with normal LFTs after that.
On [**12-1**] he had hemodialysis and had his sacral wound debrided at the bedside.
His discharge instructions included recommendations for physical therapy to continue and for appropriate wound care for his sarcal decubitus ulcer.
