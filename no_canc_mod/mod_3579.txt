Not on aspirin or coumadin.
No h/o recent fall or head strike, but daughter recalls a fall this past spring requiring a trip to the ER and sutures for a head laceration.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
Pertinent Results: CT head [**1-11**] Status post evacuation of a right subdural hematoma with little change in mass effect.
Hyperdense material within the right subdural collection, concerning for recurrent bleed, less likely residual hematoma.
Status post evacuation of right subdural hematoma with residual subdural collection, which is unchanged since the prior study.
Hyperdensities within the right subdural collection are unchanged since the prior study and likely represent acute-subacute hemorrhage.
Mild shift of midline structures to left which is unchanged.
No evidence of acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage or acute territorial infarct.
[**1-14**] EEG: No clearly epileptiform features were evident.
[**1-14**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: Mild interval increase in size of subdural collection in the right side with interval increase of mass effect and leftward shift at the vertex.
[**1-14**] Lower extremity doppler ultrasound: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
[**1-14**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Stable chest findings, plate atelectasis related to poor inspirational effort, no signs of pulmonary congestion, and no new acute infiltrates.
Status post evacuation of right subdural hematoma, with approximately 15 mm wide residual subdural collection with few areas of high density .
No significant interval decrease in the mass effect.
No shift of midline structures or brain herniation.
Branching band of plate-like atelectasis persists at the left lung base, and there is a small mucoid impaction with atelectasis in the right mid lung.
There is no pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
Pleural effusion is minimal if any.
No pneumothorax.
[**1-18**] CT Head: No interval change since removal of subdural drain.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**1-11**] with left upper extremity weakness.
She was admitted to the ICU and taken to the OR for evacuation of the blood via a right sided craniotomy later that evening.
Her post-op CT showed post-op changes but also residual/new SDH.
On [**1-14**] on AM rounds she was noted to have a left neglect and confusion so a STAT CT head was done which was stable.
This was performed without complication and a SD drain was left in place.
On [**1-17**] she was again neurologically stable and the subdural drain continued to have decent output so it was left in place.
On [**1-18**] the drain was discontinued, without complication.
A post drain removal CT was performed and revealed no new hemorrhage and good evacuation.
Chest xray was performed for intermittent tachypnea and was negative for pneumonia.
Her neurological exam continued to improve daily and at the time of discharge she was tolerating a regular diet, afebrile with stable vital signs.
