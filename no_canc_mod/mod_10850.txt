It was followed by a syncopal episode times one.
An electrocardiogram was done at that time which showed ST anterior leads and a third degree heart block.
Cardiac catheterization showed no significant disease of the left main, mild diffuse disease of the left anterior descending, right coronary artery was a small vessel without disease, and total occlusion of proximal dominant CX.
While in the catheterization laboratory, the patient developed multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia during the attempted pacemaker placement for transient complete heart block.
Obsessive compulsive disorder.
Peptic ulcer disease.
Gastrectomy [**2144**], for peptic ulcer disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, no drugs, no alcohol.
ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.
His jugular venous distention was not elevated and his neck was supple.
His chest was clear to auscultation anteriorly, but the patient was lying flat due to femoral catheter.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops were appreciated.
He had a healed midline scar.
There was no bruit but minimal oozing was present at the site.
He had 0-1+ posterior tibialis and dorsalis pedis pulses on the left and 1+ to 2+ posterior tibialis and dorsalis pedis pulses on the right.
There was slight pallor to the skin diffusely.
[**Street Address(2) 2811**] elevations in the inferior leads, 3.
Repeat electrocardiogram at outside hospital [**2174-8-16**], at 2230 showed first degree AV delay, 3.0 to 4.
[**Street Address(2) 2811**] elevation in III and aVF, ST depressions in V1 through V4.
Transthoracic echocardiogram performed [**2174-8-17**], showed an ejection fraction of 35 to 40% with moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, resting regional wall motion abnormalities including inferolateral akinesis and basal inferior akinesis, mild inferior hypokinesis, mild aortic stenosis, 1+ mitral regurgitation.
IMPRESSION:  This is an 89 year old man with very large inferior posterior ST elevation myocardial infarction with third degree AV block, lysed at outpatient hospital.
The patient was taken to the catheterization laboratory where he was found to have one vessel disease and a stent placed to the left circumflex artery.
Coronary artery disease - The patient presented from outside hospital after being given thrombolytics and taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where he was found to have one vessel disease, left circumflex, which was stented with zero percent residual stenosis.
Systolic dysfunction - A transthoracic echocardiogram performed [**2174-8-17**], showed a depressed ejection fraction of 35 to 40%.
He was treated with Neo-Synephrine and Milrinone for hypotension and low cardiac outputs for  approximately the first week of CCU stay.
Arrhythmias - The patient presented from outside hospital with electrocardiograms consistent with third degree heart block.
he had 2 episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia during the first 48 hours and was treated with Amiodarone.
This was discontinued when after development of acute lung infiltrate and hypoxia without recurrence of ventricular arrhythmias.
Serial chest x-rays were performed while in the Intensive Care Unit which indicated congestive heart failure with a consolidation in the left lobe.
He was treated for presumed aspiration pneumonia and aggressively diuresed.
Due to chest x-ray and clinical findings, he was transiently switched to adult respiratory distress syndrome ventilation protocol with increased respiratory rate and decreased tidal volumes.
Infectious disease - The patient developed fever on CCU day number two which continued for approximately the first week of hospital course.
His drop in hematocrit was thought most likely secondary to a small groin hematoma post cardiac catheterization.
Endocrine - The patient was with elevated blood sugar close to 300 on the first few days of admission and started on insulin sliding scale.
He was continued on Zoloft for his diagnosis of obsessive compulsive disorder and depression.
