Transferred to the CCU on [**2-3**] secondary to increased pericardial effusion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old female with non-insulin dependent-diabetes and COPD, whose cardiac history is significant for coronary artery disease status post MI in [**2133**], PTCA, RCA stent in [**2152**], hypertension, dyslipidemia, CHF with an ejection fraction of 25% on a transthoracic echocardiogram done [**2158-2-3**], who was evaluated for BiV placement secondary to decreased exercise tolerance and shortness of breath over the last several years.
Patient complained of left sided chest pain and had ongoing nausea on [**2158-2-3**] that prompted a transthoracic echocardiogram, which revealed a small pericardial effusion with thrombus formation over the right ventricle without evidence of tamponade.
However, she began to experience increasing nausea and heaviness in the chest, and a repeat transthoracic echocardiogram revealed slightly increased effusion size of approximately 1.5 cm.
On admission she was not experiencing any new symptoms or complaints of shortness of breath or chest pain.
CAD with a MI in [**2133**].
Cardiovascular exam:  S1, S2 regular, 2/6 systolic murmur right upper sternal border.
No JVD is noted.
Extremities:  No edema.
There is no evidence of tamponade.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 78-year-old woman with noninsulin-dependent diabetes with history of CAD, CHF with an ejection fraction of 25%.
Developed an increasing pericardial effusion, but remained hemodynamically stable.
Patient had repeated multiple follow-up echocardiograms, which demonstrated resolution of her small pericardial effusion.
Patient did complain of increased pain at the site of her pacemaker implantation.
Morphine was changed to tramadol secondary to multiple days of nausea and vomiting.
Rhythm:  Patient was V-paced with multiple PVCs.
On [**2-4**], she was noted to have rapid rates alarming for V-tach.
On [**2158-2-5**], patient was again alarmed for a rapid rate.
On [**2-6**], patient's pacer was evaluated and interrogated by the EP service, who found that she was in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Patient had pulmonary function tests one year prior to admission on [**2157-2-2**] that can serve as a pre-amiodarone baseline.
Pulmonary:  Patient was noted to have decreased sats on room air ranging 78-85%.
On [**2-5**], she is noted to have a fairly large hematoma over her ICD placement.
Nausea and vomiting:  Patient initially experienced nausea and vomiting on [**2-3**] leading to the transthoracic echocardiogram that demonstrated her pericardial effusion.
Her nausea and vomiting persisted throughout her hospital course, although is somewhat improved off of narcotics.
Patient continued to have nocturnal vomiting [**2-7**] through [**2-10**].
Patient was sent for a head CT to rule out a mass that would lead to nocturnal vomiting.
Patient was to be discharged on [**2-10**], however, this was delayed secondary to extensive diarrhea and continued vomiting.
Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea slowly resolved, and patient was able to be discharged home hemodynamically stable, tolerating p.o.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2133**] and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, right coronary artery stent in [**2152**].
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%.
Atrial fibrillation status post cardioversion.
Amiodarone was discontinued secondary to nausea and vomiting.
Patient tolerated both breakfast and lunch without further GI distress prior to discharge.
