The patient had transesophageal echocardiogram on [**5-18**] revealing a normal ejection fraction, no vegetations and no valve disease and  no signs of pulmonary hypertension.
On the [**5-20**] there were no signs of infection in this patient and it was determined the patient would be preoped for possible liver transplant and chest x-ray, electrocardiogram and laboratories were drawn.

The patient was receiving morphine sulfate as needed for pain at this time and his creatinine was noted to be improving trending downwards from 3.6 to 3.6 on the 20th and [**5-25**] postoperative days four and five and 3.2 on [**5-26**] to 2.6 on [**5-27**].
Infectious disease recommendations on [**5-25**] were to continue to follow the Vancomycin levels and the patient was on day five of 10 of Vancomycin, because of the preop MRSA bacteremia and to continue Vancomycin resistant enterococcal precautions and to continue prophylaxis with Bactrim, Fluconazole and Ganciclovir.
