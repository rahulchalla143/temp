He was initially managed at an OSH where he received CT scans of the head, c-spine, chest, abdomen, and pelvis which revealed a sternal fracture at the manubrium with associated hematoma, right [**6-24**] rib fractures with pneumothorax, T6-10, T12 vertebral fractures, and subcutaneous air near the neck.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] he was evaluated by the Acute Care Surgery service who also consulted Thoracic Surgery to evaluate possible tracheobronchial injury.
A hematoma slightly compressing the left atrium was visualized on ECHO and CTA, deemed to be likely slow venous bleed.
Several fractures of the thoracic spine visualzed on MRI, and abdominal brace in place.
HEENT: Pupils: 1 and MR Resp: Intubated, coarse ventilator sounds, CTA anteriorly, unable to auscultate posteriorly due to precautions for spinal fractures.
Right sided chest tube with a 1 chamber air leak and serosanguinous discharge.
Small amount of sanguinous staining on right chest tube dressing.
Small amount of crepitus over right chest, no crepitus palpable in neck or left chest.

Trivial pericardial effusion.
Concern for mechanical external compression of the left atrial wall.
Indistinctness is seen of the aortic arch, possibility of post-traumatic bleeding.
Engorgement of pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
Hazy opacification in the left hemithorax suggests pleural effusion with opacification tracking upward along the lateral chest wall.
The possibility of this supervening consolidation would be difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting.
Left deep sulcus sign with small radiolucent area concerning for a small pneumothorax.
CTA CHEST: Slight enlargement of hematoma surrounding the descending intrathoracic aorta most likely from a venous source as there is no evidence of active arterial extravasation or aortic injury.
The hematoma may be causing slight mass effect on the left atrium.
Shortening of the thoracic AP diameter due to multiple displaced posterior right rib fractures, likely contributing to mild left atrial compression.
Small hemopericardium, unchanged since the outside hospital study performed one day prior.
No evidence of tamponade.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
The left hemothorax has slightly increased in size since one day prior.
Pneumothorax has nearly resolved with only a tiny right anterior pneumothorax remaining.
Retrosternal hematoma remains stable in size.
No evidence of active extravasation.
Significant right rib fractures, comminuted sternal fracture, and vertebral body fractures as described above.
CT TSPINE: Multiple thoracic spine compression fractures as described in with retropulsion of the inferior aspect of T8 and T9 vertebral bodies.
Associated findings consistent with enlargement of hematoma surrounding the descending intrathoracic aorta, subcutaneous emphysema, bilateral pleural effusions, multiple rib fractures.
Multiple thoracic vertebral fractures with retropulsion of the posterior cortex at T8 and T9 levels.
The retropulsed posterior cortex contacts the spinal cord at [**Name (NI) 59724**] with a suspicious area of increased cord signal at this level concerning for cord edema/contusion.
Interspinous ligament injury at T7-T8 and T8-T9 levels.
Increased signal intensity along the posterior paraspinal soft tissues, suggestive of soft tissue injury.
Bilateral pleural effusions and prevertebral hematoma are similar to that seen on the prior CT. 5.
A single fluoroscopic spot view demonstrates a deployed IVC filter with its tip at the lower edge of L2 vertebral body.
[**2198-12-20**] CXR Bilateral chest tubes remain in place, with no visible pneumothorax.
Indwelling support and monitoring devices are similar in position with endotracheal tube terminating about 2.4 cm above the carina.
Bibasilar atelectasis is again demonstrated, slightly worse on the right, but improving on the left.
Small pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
[**2198-12-21**] CXR: No evidence of active bleeding.
Unchanged positions of bilateral chest tubes and endotracheal tube.
[**2198-12-22**] CXR: interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions.
Multiple rib fractures on the left are better appreciated as well as the right rib fractures than on the prior examination.
Right lung opacity and left basal consolidation are unchanged.
Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.
Overall no substantial change since the prior radiograph is demonstrated.
No interval development of pneumothorax is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 92275**] was evaluated in our trauma bay with physical survey and imaging showing the following injuries: Sternal fx Mediastinal hematoma Pulmonary contusion R pneumothorax L hemothorax T-spine fx t6-10 & 12  By system:  Neuro: CT of the T-spine showed multiple T-spine fractures (T4,T6-T10,T12), with possible unstable T8 & T10 fractures.
This was followed with an MRI showing spinal cord contusion at T9 but stable ligaments throughout.
He was initially tried on precedex but did not tolerate well (became hypotensive and agitated, requiring intermittent haldol).
When his acute delirium issues resolved, his regimen was tapered and he was alert and oriented x 3 and appropriate for the remainder of his [**Hospital **] hospital course.
CV: Hypotensive requiring aggressive resuscitation on arrival (7L crystalloid and 2 units PRBC on admission to ICU) with pressors in addition.
A bedside TTE on HD 2 showed a left pleural effusion with poor visulaization of the heart.
A TEE showed potential compression of the left atrium due to the hematoma with a CTA confirming decreased AP diameter due to hematoma as well as rib fractures.
Resp:  He had a right sided pneumothorax which was treated with a right CT placed at the outside hospital.
He had a left sided hemothorax which was treated with a left sided chest tube placed on admission to the [**Hospital1 18**] TSICU.
Over the course of the next few days, daily CXRs demonstrated increased opacification of this right lung field with blunting of his right costophrenic angle.
His ventilator weans (see below for more information) were also equally challenging with very little respiratory reserve.
A CT scan was obtained on HD 12 to assess further and demonstrated a moderate to large amount of fluid, likely old blood, in his right chest cavity.
A chest tube was inserted at bedside and drained approximately 800 cc of old sanguinous fluid and then 250 cc the next day followed by minimal output on its third day (HD 14).
It was removed on HD 14 and post-pull CXR demonstrated a pneumothorax, prompting reinsertion of a chest tube on HD 15.
The pneumothorax resolved, the chest tube was placed to waterseal to good effect and on HD 17, the chest tube was removed without complication.
There were weaning trials post-operative from the IVC filter on HD 4 but unable to successfully wean to pressure support as he became increasingly tachypneic and agitated.
Lasix diuresis was continued over the course of the next several days and he was ultimately weaned to pressure support but continued to struggle with settings in the face of agitation and low pulmonary reserve (see neuro and above re: hemothorax).
This was used for ventilator weans thereafter.
No major issues.
ID: Started on VAP bundle (vanc/cefep/cipro) for a presumed pneumonia on HD 5.
Bronchoscopy did show secretions and BAL grew staph aureus 10-100K.
