Admission Date:  [**2185-9-15**]     Discharge Date:  [**2185-9-19**]  Date of Birth:   [**2111-3-7**]     Sex:  F  Service:  MEDICINE HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, depression who presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital with several episodes of loss of consciousness.
The afternoon on the day of admission, she was sitting down and felt generally not well consisting of lightheadedness, nausea, diaphoresis.
The loss of consciousness lasted about 4 minutes accompanied by apparently some lip twitching and bladder incontinence, but no other movement.
The patient came to the emergency room where she was hemodynamically stable, but then had another episode of loss of consciousness.
She did notice constipation since the day prior to admission.
Of note, she was started on Paxil the week prior to admission for depression, but has had no other medication.
The patient stated that she had another episode of loss of consciousness the week prior to admission, but does not remember any details for that episode.
The daughter descriptions of the episodes are as given above with minimal lip twitching and the last time with urinary incontinence, but no other movement and usually no lasting confusion after the episode.
Noninsulin dependent diabetes for 26 years.
Iron deficiency anemia.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
On general exam she was awake in no acute distress.
Neck showed no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention.
Heart was regular rate and rhythm with a II/VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border.
Her abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with active bowel sounds.
Extremities showed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
No gross motor or sensory abnormalities.
A head CT Scan showed no abnormalities.
Abdominal CT Scan showed no abnormalities except cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
Her EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 70 with a normal axis and normal intervals without any ST changes.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the patient's loss of consciousness and sodium of 122, the patient was initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for overnight monitoring, but was sent to the Medicine floor the next day.
The etiology of the syncope was initially considered to be most likely vasovagal given the loss of consciousness accompanied by drop in blood pressure, drop in heart rate, lightheadedness and diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, however hypoglycemic episodes as well as hyponatremic seizures were also considered.
Etiology for the hyponatremia was often not initially obvious.
Under consideration was decrease due to cortisol, hypothyroidism, Paxil which was recently started and possible SIADH given the finding of a right apical density on her initial chest x-ray.
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm and telemetry revealed no more pauses or episodes of bradycardia.
Given the absence of chest pain and the lack of EKG changes, a myocardial infarction is considered unlikely and no further enzymes were checked.
The patient was orthostatic at that point and received a 500 cc IV bolus of fluid.
Shortly thereafter showed mild signs of orthostasis without symptoms.
An echocardiogram was done on [**9-19**] to rule out cardiac dysfunction.
It showed a normal right atrium, left atrium, right ventricle, left ventricle with an ejection fraction of greater than 55% and mild thickening of the mitral valve leading to decreased relaxation of the valve.
No other abnormalities were noted.
The patient's blood pressures remained slightly elevated and she was restarted on her Accupril three days after admission which stabilized her blood pressures.
She takes four units of NPH insulin in the morning and checks her sugars frequently during the day, about five to six times responding by skipping meals for high sugars and taking snacks for low sugars, but little use of the regular insulin.
It is as well possible that the syncope episode was related to hypoglycemia even though per the daughter her sugar had been high prior to the last episode of loss of consciousness.
She will follow up the day after discharge with her doctor [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for further reassignment of her regimen.
Given the appearance of old compression fractures on initial chest x-ray, the patient was given a prescription for Ergocalciferol 400 units q.d.
The right apical density in her lung was evaluated with a chest CT Scan which showed two calcified granulomas in the right apex.
NEUROLOGY:  The daughter's description of the syncopal event was mostly consistent with vasovagal etiology and not to be due to seizures.
Hyponatremia, likely due to her Paroxetine.
