Head CT: 5.7 x 2.3 cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered within the right basal ganglia, most likely hypertensive.
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  [**2104-2-13**] 1:06 PM VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL STUDY: This study was performed in collaboration with speech pathology department.
ORAL PHASE: There was moderate-to-severe impairment of bolus formation and control.
Significant premature spillover occurred prior to swallow.
There is a small amount of residue left after the swallow secondary to lingual weakness.
Tongue pumping was necessary to transport bolus, and the base of the tongue retraction was mildly reduced.
PHARYNGEAL PHASE: There is mild-to-moderate delay in swallowing initiation.
Although palatal elevation was normal, laryngeal elevation was mildly reduced.
A mild coating of residue is seen in the valleculae after the swallow.
Pharyngeal esophageal sphincter opening was within normal limits at the height of the swallow.
ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: There was intermittent penetration of nectar thick liquids, with one episode of aspiration prior to swallow.
This is apparently a result of premature spillover and delay in swallow initiation.
A delayed spontaneous cough was effective in clearing the majority of the aspirated material.
Pharyngeal dysphasia with loss of bolus control and delay in initiation of pharyngeal swallow.
Multiple episodes of penetration, and one episode of aspiration.
No aspiration of honey-thick liquids today.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2104-2-14**] 11:57 AM FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-12**], the opacification at the left base appears to be somewhat less, suggesting some resolution of atelectatic or infiltrate of change.
His hospital course by problem is as follows:  1) Right Internal Capsule Hemorrhage: This was felt to be likely secondary to hypertension given its location.
Video swallow evaluation cleared pt for modified consistency diet.
He was titrated on lisinopril for BP control.
A MRI with and without contrast could be considered in [**3-18**] weeks to rule out underlying lesion.
2) 1st degree AV block: He was monitored on tele and he was ruled out for an MI with 2 sets of CE.
3) Renal- Noted to have chronic renal insufficiency.
Likely HTN related.
Examination notable for left hemiparesis.
If you experience difficulty with vision, speech, weakness, numbness or other concerning symptoms, please call your primary care doctor or report to the emergency department for evaluation.
