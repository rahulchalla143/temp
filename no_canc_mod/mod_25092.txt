She also reports 60lb intentional wt loss from exercise earlier this year.
She denies any abdominal pain.
Cardiomegaly was noted by CXR but bedside echo reportedly showed trace pericardial effusion.
RIJ was placed bc of poor access.
Dullness in left base was noted as well as nontender abdominal distension with normoactive BS.
Previous project manager, but currently unemployed.
etoh: denies tobacco: never illicits: denies  Family History: - OA, ?
RA - no other inflammatory disorders - no bleeding problems - no CA  Physical Exam: 98.7  72  104/53  93%2L  14 .
Mild scleral icterus.
Neck Supple, No LAD, No thyromegaly.
No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
No HSM EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial pulses.
SKIN: cheek and nose rash NEURO: A&Ox3.
Volume overload as evidenced by body wall anasarca, ascites within the abdomen, bilateral pleural effusions, and periportal edema.
There is no evidence for hemorrhage.
Bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis, larger on the right.
There is also a small pericardial effusion.
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
An underlying lesion within the uterus cannot be excluded.
Would recommend correlation with gynecologic symptoms and exam.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: 57 yo female with no known PMH who presents with six weeks of progressive anasarca and pancytopenia with hemolysis.
This was chronic, since she described only mild, indolent symptoms and was relatively well compensated.
CT C/A/P did not reveal any acute bleed.
Patient improved symptomatically with transfusion, with increased energy.
Folate and iron wnl, but likely to demonstrate deficiency with increased hematopoiesis after B12 repletion.
Peripheral smear was consistent with B12 deficiency and ineffective hematopoiesis.
Hemolysis was also consistent with severe B12 deficiency.
Coagulopathy less readily explained, but may also be due to nutritional deficiency and stress on bone marrow.
Heme/onc felt that B12 deficiency did explain complete clinical picture, and most likely etiology was pernicious anemia given other autoimmune disease (see below).
anasarca: Patient was at risk of high output right heart failure from prolonged anemia.
TTE was done, which showed normal EF, however this does not rule out high output state.
No e/o nephrotic syndrome.
Of note, TSH was elevated and T4 low.
Endocrine was consulted for hypothyroidism and felt that anasarca was explained by hypothyroidism of this degree.
Most likely etiology is Hashimoto (autoimmune thyroiditis) given absence of thryoid tenderness.
Patient had bilateral pleural effusions and ascites, likely part of general anasarca picture [**2-8**] hypothyroidism.
Patient should be monitored with thyroid treatment to ensure resolution of these fluid collections.
Low voltage of EKG: Pt met criteria for low voltage.
TTE did show small pericardial effusion with no e/o tamponade.
This should be monitored as underlying nutritional deficiencies and thyroid disease is treated to ensure resolution.
Disp:*90 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: primary: B12 deficiency anemia autoimmune hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: It was a pleasure taking care of you.
You were admitted with severe anemia and total body swelling.
You were found to have severe vitamin B12 deficiency, as well as hypothyroid disease.
