CHEST PORTABLE: No prior studies are available for comparison.
There is a large pleural effusion on the right, which surrounds the entire right lung and extends into the apex.
IMPRESSION: Large right pleural effusion.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS  There is no comparison exam.
CLINICAL HISTORY: Chronic pancreatitis, possible pancreatic or pulmonary fistula, possible AV fistula.
Assess for vascular malformation.
CT ABDOMEN FINDINGS: Images of the lower thorax demonstrate a small right pleural effusion and a chest tube.
There is consolidation/atelectasis at the right lower lobe.
There is a small pneumothorax on the right.
Small left pleural effusion is also present.
Pre-contrast images of the abdomen demonstrate multiple small calcifications in the pancreas consistent with chronic pancreatitis.
There is a small fluid collection in the right diaphragmatic crus measuring less than 4 mm wide.
There are no dilated bowel loops.
There are scattered prominent lymph nodes.
CT PELVIS FINDINGS: There is no pelvic free fluid or lymphadenopathy.
Bone windows demonstrate no lytic or blastic lesions.
CTA FINDINGS: There is conventional hepatic vasculature.
There is no splenic artery aneurysm.
There is atherosclerosis at the origin of the SMA causing a high-grade stenosis but the distal SMA is patent.
There is a filling defect in the inferior mesenteric vein consistent with thrombus.
There is conventional portal venous anatomy.
There is no evidence of a fistula either within the abdomen or between the thorax and abdomen.
No AV fistula or pancreatic or pulmonary fistula as questioned.
Numerous cystic structures surrounding the pancreas consistent with pancreatic pseudocysts.
Tiny enhancing fluid collection in the right diaphragmatic crus.
This may be related to extension of pancreatitis, or alternatively extension from infection in the right lung.
Gas in the urinary bladder correlate with a recent Foley catheterization or instrumentation.
Narrowed splenic vein likely secondary to pancreatitis.
Small right pneumothorax.

Eval for postop collection CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: Chronic pancreatitis, status post Puestow.
Bloody BMs, low-grade fever and leukocytosis.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images through the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of oral and 150 cc of Optiray contrast.
Calcifications are again noted within the pancreas, consistent with chronic pancreatitis.
There is interval resolution of multiple pseudocysts that were seen in the [**2188-1-6**] study.
There is residual fluid within the splenic hilum, measuring 2.9 x 1.6 cm.
There is interval appearance of a small focus of arterial enhancement just inferior to the splenic artery measuring 8 mm in diameter, likely representing a small splenic artery aneurysm.
There is also a drain entering the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, traversing the abdomen between the stomach and pancreas.
Bowel anastomosis is noted within the left mid abdomen.
No filling defect is noted within the IMV on this study.
No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
No free pelvic fluid, and no pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.
Status post Puestow procedure, nearly all of the prior pancreatic pseudocysts have resolved.
There is small amount of residual fluid near the splenic hilum as described.
Interval development of small splenic artery aneurysm, measuring 8 mm.
No definite filling defect is noted within the IMV on the current exam.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] to the ICU at [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup and treatment of pancreatic pseudocyst and pleural effusion.
Patient was started on octreotide, TPN, NPO & IVF and antibiotics dc'd with a presumptive diagnosis or pancreatico-pleural fistula.
After CT scans and monitoring patient's clinical picture, it was decided to take the patient to the OR on HD9.
Patient was discovered to have phlebitis at his picc site with some pus drainage as well as positive blood cultures.
Vascular surgery was consulted and monitored his phlebitis for a few days until it was decided that it did not need to be excised.
Patient continued to have fevers for the next few days which finally disappeared after 48 hours of antibiotics.
Got an epidural for pain which was well controlled, changed to a PCA on POD3.
Again spiked a temp on POD3, cultures sent and cxr showed atelectasis vs aspiration and levoquin was started.
patient stayed in the hospital for the remainder of his 14d course of IV abx since he had no insurance.
POD9 patient had a few bloody stools.
