Extensive periventricular white matter hypodensities most consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes.

There is no overt failure, however.
Hypertensive cardiomediastinal configuration is noted.
The thrombus in the right internal jugular is approximately 0.6 cm in length; both thrombi obstructs greater than 50% of their respective vessel.
IMPRESSION: 2 nonocclusive thrombi -- one in right internal jugular, other in right basilic vein   DISCHARGE LABS: [**2165-9-23**] 05:29AM BLOOD WBC-8.7 RBC-4.06* Hgb-11.1* Hct-34.3* MCV-85 MCH-27.2 MCHC-32.2 RDW-17.2* Plt Ct-395 [**2165-9-23**] 05:29AM BLOOD Glucose-134* UreaN-13 Creat-0.8 Na-142 K-3.9 Cl-107 HCO3-26 AnGap-13 [**2165-9-23**] 05:29AM BLOOD Calcium-9.0 Phos-3.2 Mg-2.0  Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year-old female with history of multiple recent admissions for catatonia, CAD, dCHF, dementia/psychosis (baseline oriented X 2) who presented with  altered mental status from her nursing home.
ACUTE DIAGNOSES:  # Encephalopathy: The patient has been hospitalized on multiple occasions recently for delirium & unresponsiveness.
She as been worked-up extensively for these episodes without identification of a clear organic etiology.
On this admission, the patient was tachycardic, febrile, & with intermittent apneic episodes where she desatted to the 80s.
ABG showed respiratory alkalosis.
ECT was consulted but felt her symptoms had significantly improved & she could continue on ativan for her symptoms, although ECT may be considered in the future were her symptoms to worsen.
# Acute Kidney Injury: Creatinine 1.3 on admission which improved after IVFs to baseline of 1.0.
# Right upper extremity clot:   Felt to be old from prior line and decision was made that the risks of anticoagulation out weigh the benefits given patient's frequent refusal to take medication and possible need for ECT therapy in the future.
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:  # Depression: Her catatonic-like syndrome on admission resolved as above.
# Hypertension: Clonidine was added to the patient's home regimen of hydralazine, amlodipine, losartan, & metoprolol.
# Risk for readmission: Ms. [**Known lastname **] dementia & psychiatric comorbidities place her at high risk for readmission if she decompensates in the community.
