This gentlemen was recently admitted one month ago for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolus and was discharged to [**Hospital3 7**] where he was noted today on the day of admission to have 300 cc of bright red blood per rectum and hypotension systolic in the 80s.
He had been started on Lovenox in the hospital and on Coumadin prior to being discharged for his venous thromboembolic disease.
Patient denied any fevers, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness or lightheadedness.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on two liters of home 02 at night.
Prior CVA with right-sided weakness.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Ventricular ectopy and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and he did have an echocardiogram in [**2115-3-21**] showing an ejection fraction of 50%.
Right upper lobe mass seen on CT on the most recent admission and also noticed on chest x-ray of this admission whose cause is unknown, but is most likely felt to be malignant in nature.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Room, the patient was hypotensive in the 80s systolic range.
Nasogastric lavage revealed small amount of coffee ground material and a small bright red clot which cleared with less than 500 cc normal saline.
In the Emergency Department, he also received treatment for hypercalcemia in the setting of his ectopy seen on monitor.
Echocardiogram was obtained which showed ST depressions in the lateral segments and a chest x-ray revealed no pulmonary edema, persistence of the right upper lobe mass and flattened diaphragm.
Heart rate of 120 with frequent premature ventricular contractions.
Generally, she was tachypneic with retractions and using accessory muscles with copious upper airway secretions.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Significant for conjunctival pallor.
Neck was supple without any lymphadenopathy and difficult to assess the jugular venous pressure due to the retractions.
There was no thyromegaly.
Cardiovascular was tachycardic without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, with hyperactive bowel sounds and no hepatosplenomegaly.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  An abdominal CT was performed revealing only a slightly dilated head of the pancreas consistent with IPMT.
The remainder of his abdominal laboratories were normal.
Patient was taken to Interventional Radiology that night for angiography which revealed a small blush in the duodenum which was coiled at that time by Interventional Radiology.
>......<cells in the Emergency Department and he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for observation and had a esophagogastroduodenoscopy the following morning which revealed only small superficial erosions and no frank ulcerations in the duodenum.
About the same time, he was noted to have approximately a liter of maroon stools and also an expanding groin hematoma at the site of the line removal.
Emergent ultrasound of the right groin revealed a heterogenous flow in the >.....<however, no direct fistula was seen.
He had a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy which again showed only superficial mucosal erosions and no blood.
He was kept NPO and observed and colonoscopy was performed by Gastrointestinal in the Intensive Care Unit, which revealed diverticula, however, no evidence of bleeding.
Unclear source given the positive angiographic findings and lack of findings on esophagogastroduodenoscopy times two and negative colonoscopy.
His second visit to the Intensive Care Unit regarding his decreased hematocrit may have been related to his groin hematoma as opposed to a new gastrointestinal bleed.
If he re-bleeds again, he should have a bleeding scan obtained promptly and Gastrointestinal should be re-consulted.
There was no discrete aneurysm or pseudoaneurysms seen and there was no flow seen in the hematoma indicating a stable lesion.
Intermittent atrial fibrillation while in the Intensive Care Unit:  The patient has multiple premature ventricular contractions and ectopy and also has atrial fibrillation, however, again, we will not anticoagulate given his ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding issues.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  The patient has severe lung disease and he will continue using a steroid taper.
Right upper lobe mass:  Most likely being malignancy given his extensive smoking history and the persistence of this mass over a one month time.
The wife and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1632**] have decided that it is not in the patient's best interest to discuss it with him at this time in the setting of this acute illness, however, it should be addressed with him at some point in the future.
It is likely given his poor underlying pulmonary status, that he will die with this lesion as a result from it.
Leukocytosis:  Most likely related to his prednisone and may also be related to his likely pulmonary malignancy.
