She has recently been experiencing new exertional dyspnea.
She also experiences a burning sensation in her chest concurrently with the dyspnea both of which resolve with rest.
Her repeat echocardiogram in [**2172-12-3**] confirmed progression of her aortic stenosis with a calculated valve area of 0.6cm and peak/mean gradients of 70 and 43mmHg.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve is bicuspid with a vertical commissure.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
POST-BYPASS: The patient is on no inotropes.
There is a well-seated, well-functioning bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position.
There is no aortic regurgitation.
No paravalvular leak is seen.
There is a gradient of 7 mmHg across the aortic valve at a cardiac output of 5.0 L/min.
CXR: [**2173-2-27**] The patient is status post sternotomy, with mild prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.
A left-sided dual-lead pacemaker is present, with lead tips over the right atrium and right ventricle.
There is patchy increased retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and probable small left effusion.
There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle and minimal atelectasis at the right base.
Curvilinear lucency adjacent to the left hilum is noted, ?
some pericardial or, less likely, mediastinal emphysema.
There is a small left apical pneumothorax, better seen and slightly larger than on [**2173-2-25**].
A small amount of free air is seen under the right hemidiaphragm, unchanged.
