He reported associated pleuritic chest pain, generalized weakness, diaphoresis and anorexia.
CXR showed moderate RLL consolidation, small RUL consolidation, patchy infiltrates in LUL (differential included pneumonitis, pulmonary hemorrhage versus ARDS).
He had hypotension requiring both norepinephrine and vasopressin for pressor support.
Sputum culture grew Strep pneumonia and [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans on [**2178-4-13**].
Bronchoscopy showed diffuse thick dark yellow secretions throughout the entire tracheobronchial tree.
BAL grew Strep pneumonia (PCP and fungal cultures pending).
Influenza negative.
Blood cultures were positive for Strep pneumonia on [**2178-4-13**].
Opportunisitic infections were considered, but HIV testing was not obtained.
He was also noted to have acute kidney injury with creatinine 3.7 and BUN 64.
Review of systems: unable to obtain due to sedation and intubation  Past Medical History: ruptured appendix and appendectomy   Social History: Works as a realtor, lives with a male partner.
Family History: Mother died age 73 of pancreatic cancer.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: Vitals: 98.7 92 109/68 on pressure control, changed to AC 26 450mL 100% FIO2 and PEEP 10 on arrival, sedated with fentanyl and propofol General: intubated, sedated, not responding to voice HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, PERRL Neck: supple, right subclavian line c/d/i CV: RRR, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Lungs: rhonchi anteriorly, no wheezes, rales, ronchi Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly GU: no foley Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema Neuro: CNII-XII intact, 5/5 strength upper/lower extremities, grossly normal sensation, 2+ reflexes bilaterally, gait deferred, finger-to-nose intact .
There are extensive areas of lung parenchymal opacities and consolidations, slightly more extensive on the left than on the right, with extensive air bronchograms but no evidence of pleural effusions.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
Extensive ground-glass opacity is consistent with diffuse infection.
An additional component of pulmonary edema is possible, given the accompanying septal thickening.
Three large thick-walled cavitary lesions likely represent a necrotizing pneumonia in this patient with prior streptococcal bacteremia.
A fourth smaller caviation and non-cavitary consolidation are also present.
Note that the plain radiographic appearence of diffuse pulmonary opacity has improved since [**4-15**].
No acute intracranial process.
Bilateral mastoid air cell fluid-opacification.
Given the documented Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, this may represent infectious otomastoiditis, rather than simply effusions due recent intubation and prolonged supine positioning.
No evidence of infection, inflammation, infarction, or hemorrhage within brain.
Pansinusitis and bilateral mastoid opacification.
Brief Hospital Course: 43 year man with history of etoh abuse who presented to [**Hospital1 2519**] on [**2178-4-13**] with productive cough, fever, bandemia and respiratory failure, found to have Strep pneumonia with septic shock and [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
# Septic shock: Secondary to Strep pneumonia with positive blood and sputum cultures at [**Hospital3 4107**].
He was initially improving on the antibiotics but then spiked fevers on [**4-20**] and [**4-21**].
CT chest on [**4-21**] revealed three large thick-walled cavitary lesions likely represent a necrotizing pneumonia.
# ARDS: Suspected due to underyling Strep pneumonia.
# Acute renal failure: Suspected ATN secondary to septic shock.
# Agitation: Patient was extremely agitation while on the ventilator, rquiring large doses of fentanyl and versed.
LP was negative for infection and CT and MRI head were both negative for acute process.

You were admitted with a severe pneumonia, and were in the intensive care unit for two weeks intubated.
We were able to treat this serious pneumonia with antibiotics, and your pneumonia improved.
Initially you were a bit weak on your feet after you woke up from being intubated and sedated, but were able to improve to an acceptable functional status for home once you worked with physical therapy for a few days.
