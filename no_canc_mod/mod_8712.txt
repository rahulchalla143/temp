He had a CT scan of the head that showed a right parietal occipital intra parenchymal with a small extension to the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
He was unable to have an MRI because of previous hip surgery that had metal so he had a CTA that showed no underlying lesion except for most likely amyloid angiopathy.
He continued to have about the same mental status exam with slight disorientation and inattentiveness but will follow commands and is moving all fours.
