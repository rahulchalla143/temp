Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma who presents with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory distress.
Differential remained broad with the most likely cause being acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Prior to admission she described a prodrome lasting a few weeks, with acute onset of shortness of breath the day of presentation.
She was also worked up for vasculitis and possible hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
#) Sepsis: patient became septic during her initial course, requiring blood pressure support with pressors.
Given her presentation a pulmonary source of infection was favored, her blood and urine cultures remained negative.
#) Acute renal failure: Initially concern for a pre-renal cause based on her Fena vs. hypoperfusion due to her hypotension.
Patient had muddy brown casts in her urine, making ATN likely in the setting of hypotension.
Her anemia and [**Doctor First Name **] positivity were both supportive, however she was ANCA negative.
#) Anemia: Unknown baseline HCT, no hemoptysis to suggest DAH.
Guaiaced stools, check iron studies, B12, folate, patient had no signs of active bleeding during her course.
