There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
Small pleural effusions remain bilaterally, but there has been improved aeration at the bases bilaterally.
IMPRESSION:  1) Small bilateral pleural effusions.
2) Improved atelectasis at the bases bilaterally.
CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS; CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS  Reason: CTA Head/Neck with Aortic Arch visualized please.
Planning Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 60 year old woman with significant stenosis Lt CCA, Rt ICA w/ subacute stroke REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: CTA Head/Neck with Aortic Arch visualized please.
Planning for carotid surgery, eval CC & ICA stenosis CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
CTA NECK  HISTORY: 60-year-old woman with left posterior parietal subacute infarct.
Please assess the carotid vessels, possible carotid surgery.
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous 5 mm axial images from the skull base to the vertex were obtained before the administration of IV contrast.
A small left parietal infarct is again seen, with new hyperdensity within it, which likely represents petechial hemorrhage.
There is approximately 60% narrowing of the lumen of the left internal carotid artery bulb.
There is approximately 1 cm long flap within the left internal carotid artery bulb, consistent with a dissection.
Within the first approximately 6 mm of the right internal carotid artery bulb, no intraluminal contrast is seen.
Contrast is seen filling the distal part of the internal carotid bulb.
The right cervical and intracranial internal carotid artery is markedly diminished in size.
These findings suggest that this is a high grade stenosis and not a complete occlusion of the proximal right internal carotid artery bulb.
The origin of the left occipital artery occurs just distal to the end of the dissection flap and on the right just distal to the high-grade stenosis of the right internal carotid artery bulb.
The left common carotid artery is difficult to evaluate due to beam hardening artifact from the concentrated IV contrast within the adjacent left internal jugular vein.
The origins of the vertebral arteries bilaterally show atherosclerotic disease, but the exact degree of stenosis is difficult to assess.
Note is made of a triplicated anterior cerebral artery with a branch arising from the communicating segment of the left internal carotid artery.
There is an air-fluid level within the sphenoid sinuses.
Mucosal thickening of the ethmoid, maxillary, and right frontal recess are also noted.
There are degenerative changes of the cervical spine without high-grade canal stenosis.
Partially imaged is a large left and a small right pleural effusion.
Short segment dissection of the left internal carotid artery bulb.
Approximately 60% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery bulb.
High-grade stenosis of the right internal carotid artery bulb with diminution in size of the distal portion of the cervical and intracranial portions of the right internal carotid artery.
New petechial hemorrhage of the left parietal infarct compared to [**2177-2-3**] as well as a stable right internal capsule hemorrhage.
CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE PORT  Reason: eval for carotid stenosis  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 60 year old woman with new left parietal infarct REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval for carotid stenosis HISTORY: 60-year-old woman status post motor vehicle collision, presenting with left parietal cerebral infarct.
Peak systolic velocities on the right side were 92 cm/sec for the internal carotid artery, 60 cm/sec for the common carotid artery and 95 cm/sec for the external carotid artery.
Less than 40% stenosis in the right internal carotid artery.
80-99% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Conclusions: Technically suboptimal study due to very poor echo windows.
No paradoxical flow is seen with saline injection at rest (patient unable to cooperate with maneuvers).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No definite aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No definite mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No definite cardiac source of embolism identified.
She underwent CT imaging to assess injuries; there were no intracranial or intraabdominal injuries identified.
A small left apical pneumothorax was identified, a left chest thoracostomy tube was placed; this was eventually removed.
Thoracic was consulted because of her mechanism of injury with air ag deployment and subsequent development of respiratory failure.
There were no operative intervention for this.
Vascular surgery and Stroke Consults were placed because of a finding on radiographic imaging revealing a left carotid artery stenosis suggestive a dissection.
There was no cord or ligament injury.
The NG tube was eventually removed and her diet was advanced to soft with thin liquids.
Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted and have recommended short term rehab stay.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 Puffs Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p Motor vehiclew crash Bilateral rib fractures Intertrochanteric fracture right leg Small left apical pneumothorax Pulmonary contusions   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You will need to continue on the Heparin drip until your goal INR is reached.
