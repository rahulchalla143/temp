Mild subsegmental atelectasis at the left lung base.
There is absence of color flow and non-compressibility of the left peroneal vein, otherwise, there is normal color flow, compressibility and augmentation.

No hydronephrosis and no perinephric collections identified.
Brief Hospital Course: #DVT/PE - Lower extremity doppler U/S on [**2125-3-3**] revealed thrombus in the left peroneal vein.
Due to concomitant hypoxemia, a presumptive diagnosis of PE was made.
V/Q scan was deferred due to underlying COPD and a baseline abnormal CXR, and CTA chest was deferred due to renal insufficiency.
He will likely require [**3-16**] months of therapeutic anticoagulation.
Goal INR is at the lower end of the therapeutic range due to his GI AVM's, prior bleeding and risk for re-bleeding.
#Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure - Attributed to a combination of discontinuation of diuretic medication, alterations in the antihypertensive regimen, and acute on chronic renal insufficiency.
TTE [**2-21**] revealed LVEF 35-40%, moderate septal hypokinesis, and mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior segments.
He will be discharged on aspirin, metoprolol, furosemide, metolazone, and isosorbide mononitrate for afterload reduction.
An ACEi was not prescribed due to allergy.
#Acute on chronic renal insufficiency - Due to intravascular volume depletion in the setting of CHF exacerbation and antihypertensive therapy, as evidenced by an extremely low urinary sodium on admission.
Initial renal ultrasound was unremarkable, but repeat exam on [**3-9**] revealed evidence of rejection.
#Acute blood loss anemia - The patient had guaiac positive stools without overt evidence of bleeding.
Colonoscopy [**2125-3-1**] revealed a proximal ascending colon AVM which was treated with argon thermal therapy.
Endoscopy on that date showed non-bleeding erosions in the stomach and proximal jejunum.
ABG was not suggestive of profound hypercarbia or hypoxia.
EKG did not reveal evidence of new ischemia or arrhythmia.
#Post-herpetic neuralgia - Continued fentanyl patch and nortriptyline.
It was recommended that the patient consider formal neuropsychological testing in the future to evaluate for memory or cognitive deficits.
#Coronary artery disease - No acute issues.
#Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - No acute issues.
#Dyslipidemia - Continued simvastatin.
