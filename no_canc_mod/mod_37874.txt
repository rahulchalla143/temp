1) Confusion:  The differential in this patient includes hepatic encephalopathy, meningitis, and infection of any sort - possibly spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
He lacks meningeal signs, however, and this, combined with being afebrile, without a high white count, makes bacterial meningitis less likely, though it should be kept in mind should the patient deteriorate.
Additionally, patient appears dry on exam, with decreased PO intake.
--cover empirically for SBP with levaquin 250 mg PO daily --monitor wbc count, temperature --hold diuretics for now --lactulose titrated to frequent BMs --paracentesis today --albumin 1.5g/kg (50g now, then 25 later with procedure)  2) AIDS:  Continue [**Last Name (LF) 2775**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] pharmacy doses.
Don't think pt's small episode of hematemesis warrants another EGD, as just had one last week, showed grade 1 esophageal varices.
He is guaiac positive, however, and likely has some chronic GI blood loss (varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy?).
--follow GI recs.
Not likely hepatorenal given chronicity.
He did not have any further seizure activity.
CD4 nadir was 30 in [**2159**] with Kaposi's sarcoma.
2) HCV, cirrhosis - Diagnosed in [**2164**].
Has had freqent episodes of ascites requiring paracentesis.
3) Esophageal varices - Grade 1.
