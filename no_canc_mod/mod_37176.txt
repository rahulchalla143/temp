Chest x-ray showed mild congestive heart failure at that time.
She was treated with Lasix which is new for her congestive heart failure, even though the ejection fraction was 60 to 70% by transthoracic echocardiogram.
She was also given a Prednisone taper for suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare which ended on [**2167-9-17**].
Since discharge on [**2167-9-3**], the patient did fine for the first week, however, four days prior to admission, the patient called her primary care provided, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], with increased bilateral lower extremity edema because she had stopped her Lasix secondary to excessive urination.
One day prior to admission, the patient came in to the primary care provider's office with an increased lower extremity edema and mild productive cough.
She also complained of shortness of breath without fevers or chills.
