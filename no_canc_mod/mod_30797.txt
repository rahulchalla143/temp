Admission Date:  [**2167-7-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2167-8-21**]  Date of Birth:  [**2101-5-5**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Phenergan / Tylenol / Quinolones / Oxycodone / Enalapril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3624**] Chief Complaint: Nausea and Vomitting in setting of NSTEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization Hemodialysis   History of Present Illness: 66F ESRD s/p DCD renal transplant ([**2160**]) and hx of AFib s/p cardiversions X 2 (On Coumadin), CAD with stress test in [**Month (only) **] [**2165**] showing some anterior apical attenuation with possible peri-infarct ischemia, diastolic heart failure (Echo at OSH showed anteroapical akinesis with an LVEF of 45%, decreased from 60% in [**3-5**], marked pulmonary HTN, estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was 74, 1+ MR) and PVD transferred today from OSH with a NSTEMI with plans for cardiac cath who presents to the CCU with signficant abdominal pain.
Of note, the patient was admitted for severe abdominal pain in [**3-5**] and constipation (no BM x 7days) and was much improved after bowel cleansing.
The pt presented to OSH last weekend with a one week history of lightheadedness and low heart rate.
She was believed to have tachybrady syndrome and cardiology was consulted to evaluate patient for pacemaker placement.
On Tuesday morning, however, she went to her PCP for SOB, he was concerned that she had an infection and started her on levaquin and perscribed home oxygen.
She presented to [**Hospital3 **] again the next morning ([**7-22**]) with fever (100.5), multiple arthralgias and abdominal pain, denying chest pain.
Her EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, LVH, poor R-wave progession, question of an old anteroseptal infarct and lateral T-wave inversions in I, avL and V5 and V6.
Her abdominal pain was evaluated by CT which showed a distended gb as the only pathology with subsequent RUQ US showing a small amount of gb sludge, moderately distended gb, but no pericholecystic fluid, with mild dilatation of the CBD to 8mm.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] with a NSTEMI for possible cath in the setting of severe renal disease as her renal transplant team is here, and accepted by CCU with severe abdominal pain and positive CEs.
On transfer to CCU, pt complaining of diffuse abdominal pain.
The pain is associated with nausea, distension, and bowel urgency.
The patient's daughter reports a few episodes of non-bloody emesis at the OSH, patient had a large normal bowel movement yesterday morning.
She was started on a heparin gtt in light of elevated CEs at OSH, and abdominal pain as a possible anginal equivalent.
A stat CT abd w/o contrast was ordered [**12-29**] to poor renal function, and surgery was consulted.
CT did not reveal any obvious cause for her pain.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA,  cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for minimal exertional activity at baseline, patient uses wheelchair [**12-29**] LE ulcer, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, [**12-30**] pillow orthopnea, lightheadedness, denies chest pain, ankle edema, palpitations.

Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
CARDIAC: S1 S2, [**1-2**] pan-systolic murmur, heard best at left 5th intercostal space LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Posterior exam was not performed [**12-29**] patient discomfort, anteriorly decreased breath sounds at the right lung base.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No peritoneal signs.
No femoral bruits.
Small gallstones.
No evidence of cholecystitis.
Doppler evaluation of the transplant could not be obtained due to respiratory motion and body habitus.
No acute intra-abdominal process.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Pervasive calcified atherosclerotic disease.
[**2167-7-27**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to distal septal, anterior and apical hypokinesis to akinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2167-3-6**], the extent of regional LV systolic dysfunction has increased.
[**2167-8-7**] Cardiac catheterization: 3 vessel disease: LMCA had a 40% ostial lesion, LAD 99% stenosis in mid-portion, , LCX had a 90% proximal stenosis, RCA heavily calcified vessel with a proximal 95% stenosis and a distal 80% stenosis.
Elevated left sided filling pressures.
No intervention.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 66yo F w/hx of ESRD s/p kidney transplant ([**2160**]), CAD, HTN, DM2 transferred from [**Hospital1 18**] [**7-23**] for NSTEMI.
# ARF: On admission patient c/o abdominal pain, constipation, rising lactate 1.5 to 1.8, exam concerning for mesenteric ischemia.
Given diffuse atherosclerotic disease, CTA was done which did not show any acute ischemic event.
Her cr worsened secondary to contrast nephropathy and poor perfusion from cardiac disease.
She subsequently developed low urine output and pulmonary edema which was unresponsive to lasix.
Her acute renal failure was managed as outlined above.
On [**7-27**] echo showed reduced EF EF 30-35% and cardiac enzyme peak to troponin 5.07.
She underwent cath on [**2167-8-7**] which showed 3 vessel disease:  LMCA had a 40% ostial lesion, LAD 99% stenosis in mid-portion, LCX had a 90% proximal stenosis, RCA heavily calcified vessel with a proximal 95% stenosis and a distal 80% stenosis.
She was evaluated by CT [**Doctor First Name **] [**8-8**] and was not considered a surgical candidate due to aortic calcifications.
She then underwent repeat cath [**2167-8-10**] during which Promus stents were placed in the distal and proximal RCA lesions, and the mid LAD stenosis was ballooned but a stent could not be passed.
# ABDOMINAL PAIN: On admisison there was concern for intestinal ischemia given severe abdominal pain with guarding, rising lactate, PVD, recent NSTEMI, diffuse athermatous plaques within the aorta and possible sensitivity to low flow state.
No signs of obstruction on portable xray.
Given the severity of her pain and clinical picture, it was felt that the study was warranted.
Her CT abdomen/pelvis showed no evidence of mesenteric ischemia and the patient's abdominal pain seemed to resolve progressively without intervention.
# CHF: Baseline diastolic heart failure with EF 60% on 4/[**2166**].
There was also marked pulmonary HTN, estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure 74, and 1+ MR.
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: On admission she had an INR of 5.1 and received Vitamin K and warfarin was held.
# UTI: Microscopic hematuria with 6-10WBC and many bacteria were seen on urinalysis on [**8-2**].
# Hypertension: On admission, patient was hypertensive to SBPs 160s.
Upon transfer to the floors patient had episodes of hypotension and weakness.
Hyponatremia: On the floor patient was hyponatremic (Na 125) secondary to hypervolemia from CHF and RF.
She improved w/ fluid restriction.
# Gout: Colchicine was held in the acute setting w/o any flairs and restarted on discharge.

Discharge Disposition: Home with Service  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute Myocardial Infarction Acute on Chronic Stystolic Congestive Heart Failure Acute Renal Failure   Discharge Condition: Stable.
A work up revealed that you had a heart attack, for which you underwent cardiac catheterization and received stents to the vessels of your heart.
Because of your poor heart function and the contrast you received when getting CT scan and catheterization, your kidneys failed.
You had to undergo hemodialysis to improve your kidney function.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight increases by more than 3 lbs from the previous day.
If you do your stent may close causing an additional heart attack.
You have been started on Calcitriol and Calcium Acetate for elevated phosporus levels.
