Calcified granulomas in the RUL noted as seen on prior CT. Bibasilar interstitial abnormality and mucoid impaction has increased compared to the prior study.
Upper lobe lucency is due to emphysema.
There is no sign of pneumonia or CHF.
The heart is mildly enlarged.
There may be a trace right pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is tortuosity of the thoracic aorta with atherosclerotic calcification, but the mediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable.
There is degenerative change of the thoracolumbar spine with evidence of prior vertebroplasty in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine.
Old right rib fractures noted.
IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly, emphysema, bibasilar scarring slightly progressed.

Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 35852**] is a [**Age over 90 **] F with a history of bronchiectasis who presents with 2-day history of worsening cough/dyspnea.
In the ED, she was noted to be hypoxic requiring 6L by NC to maintain O2 sats in mid-90s and had elevated lactate to 2.6 and was referred to the ICU given concern for deterioration.
HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient has a history of bronchiectasis but based on imaging findings may also have an element of COPD/emphysema.
She had wheezing on exam on admission and felt symptomatically improved after nebs in the ED.
She also had dry rales at the bases.
She was swabbed for influenza (DFA negative; oseltamavir stopped) and urinary legionella antigen was also noted to be negative.
She was covered with broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, cefepime and azithromycin to cover HAP given her recent admission for kyphoplasty.
Patient has had frequent hyponatremia in the past per OMR records with a baseline 133-136.
Given elevated BUN and physical exam, she was felt likely somewhat dry and received IVF wtih normal saline.
Elevated urine osmolality >400 and lack of IVF causing improvement would point to SIADH as a possible cause.
Attempt was made to minimize lines/tubes and to re-orient.
Delirium was likely compounded by very poor hearing, as she had persistent difficulty understanding staff.
COUGH: Patient reported worsening cough x 2 days.
