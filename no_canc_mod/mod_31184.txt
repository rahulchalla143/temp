Admission Date:  [**2180-2-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2180-2-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2109-5-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Phenergan / Lorazepam  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**] Chief Complaint: Transfer from [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] for possible tracheostomy  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PEG and tracheostomy placement  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old woman with morbid obesity, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and diastolic heart failure who is transferred from [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] for tracheostomy placement.
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] on [**2-2**] with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure of unclear etiology.
She was admitted to the ICU for non-invasive ventilation, which she could not tolerate; she was subsequently intubated.
MRSA was found on sputum culture (but no white count and no fever), and vancomycin was started (now day #5).
The day prior to transfer, she developed a low-grade temperature to 99.3 axillary with systolic blood pressures in the 80's.
Her beta blocker and calcium channel blocker (which she is on because of atrial fibrillation with RVR) were discontinued, and her rhythm converted into atrial fibrillation with RVR.
Of note, she was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after an admission for digoxin overdose, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and UTI treated with 10 day course of levofloxacin.
Morbid obesity.
Mechanical aortic valve in [**2165**].
Atrial fibrillation.
History of decubitus ulcers.
Ankle fracture, status post fall in [**2177-9-25**] with long rehabilitation.
History of diastolic congestive heart failure (EF greater than 55% with mild LVH, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of greater than 18, 1+ MR).
Physical Exam: VITALS: T 98.6F, HR 100's, BP 105/59, RR 19, Sat 98% VENT: A/C Tv 500, Rate 12 (overbreathing), PEEP 10, FiO2 0.5 GENERAL: Morbidly obese, ventilated, no acute distress HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, MMM NECK: Thick neck, unable to appreciate JVP CARD: Irregularly irregular, normal S1/S2, 2/6 systolic murmur heard loudest at apex RESP: Clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly ABD: Obese, non-distended.
Venous stasis changes.
There is some blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggestive of a small effusion.
Large cardiac silhouette with left-sided effusion, similar to prior study.
Brief Hospital Course: 70yF with atrial fibrillation, aortic valve replacement, admitted to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] with respiratory failure requiring ventilation, now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for tracheostomy placement.
#) Hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure.
This was thought to be secondary to obesity hypoventilation syndrome with components of CHF and possibly pneumonia.
She was sent for a trach after her INR trended down to <1.5 and tolerated this without difficulty.
She remained afebrile and did not require pressor support.
#) Atrial fibrillation.
She was in poorly controlled atrial fibrillation on admission and was intially treated with digoxin given her borderline blood pressure.

Secondary: Mechanical AVR, Diabetes II, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Stable on her vent settings, interactive, and tolerating PEG feeds   Discharge Instructions: Please follow the instructions at the rehab facility and take your medications.
