Admission Date:  [**2200-2-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2200-2-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2147-5-5**]     Sex:  M  Service:  MEDICINE HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52 year-old male with a history of multi drug resistant HIV status post failed HAART therapy, stopped on [**2200-2-4**] who presents with a one week history of bloody diarrhea.
The patient also complains of headache, confusion and lethargy.
Coagulopathic with INR of 65.6 and in acute renal failure with BUN of 100 and creatinine of 8.
Acid Base - The patient anion gap and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to diarrhea and acute renal failure.
Renal - Acute renal failure with creatinine of 8 up from baseline of 1.7.
Creatinine gradually decreased to normal levels with volume repletion.
Renal ultrasound was negative for obstruction.
Sediment was consistent with pre-renal etiology.
No evidence of ATN.
Fluid Status - The patient's hypotension and tachycardia improved with volume repletion.
Electrolytes - The patient's potassium and magnesium were aggressively repleted in setting of ongoing diarrhea.
Bloody diarrhea was thought to be secondary to elevated INR.
On admission elevated INR was thought to be secondary to inadvertent Coumadin overdosing.
Neurologic - In patient with elevated INR and change in mental status.
There is concern for intracranial bleed.
CT scan of the head was negative for hemorrhage.
The patient returned to baseline mental status with fluid repletion.
Infectious Disease - There was initial concern for sepsis secondary to patient's hypotension.
The patient remained afebrile and responded well to fluid and blood resuscitation so antibiotics were stopped.
Currently the patient continues to have diarrhea but it has decreased in frequency.
Deep venous thrombosis seven weeks ago.
History of nephrolithiasis and chronic hydronephrosis secondary to Crixivan.
In general the patient is alert, in no acute distress.
Sclerae - anicteric.
Cardiovascular - tachycardic, regular rhythm, no murmurs.
Extremities - no edema.
Hematology - In the admitting setting of bloody diarrhea the patient's hematocrit remained low but stable status post transfusion.
Renal - Acute renal failure secondary to volume depletion.
Gastrointestinal - Diarrhea became non-bloody once INR was corrected.
Infectious Disease - Stool studies were sent which were positive for microsporidia times two as well as 4+ PMNs.
Since microsporidia does not normally cause inflammatory diarrhea there was suspicion for co-infection with another organism.
Diarrhea secondary to microsporidia.
Elevated INR secondary to inadvertent Coumadin overdosing with resultant bright red blood per rectum.
Acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis secondary to dehydration and diarrhea.
Chronic hydronephrosis secondary to nephrolithiasis from prior Crixivan therapy.
