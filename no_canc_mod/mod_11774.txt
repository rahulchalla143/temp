Atrial fibrillation.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Congestive heart failure.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  Significant for a heavy ex-smoker.
LABORATORY:  The patient, upon catheterization, was found to have severe three-vessel coronary artery disease.
Catheterization showed a left middle coronary artery stenosis of 90%, proximal left anterior descending 80%, middle left anterior descending 70%, proximal right coronary artery of 70%, middle right coronary artery of 80%.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was hemodynamically stable and was originally scheduled for the Operating Room on [**2190-3-11**], however, due to a fever spike which never showed any evidence of infection, the case was cancelled until [**2190-3-12**].
The patient had this triple bypass of the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending, a vein graft to the obtuse marginal and another vein graft to the patent ductus arteriosus.
The diagnosis was severe coronary artery disease with left main disease and a decreased ejection fraction.
Upon arrival on the Floor, the only attachment he had left was a peripheral intravenous and wires which had been left in place by the Intensive Care Unit staff in the event of a bradycardic episode or any type of hemodynamic instability.
These were discontinued on [**2190-3-19**], by the House Officer after the patient showed no signs of an arrhythmia.
