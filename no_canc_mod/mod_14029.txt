He was subsequently transferred via LifeFlight ground due to high wind to [**Hospital1 1444**].
A 36 French left chest tube was placed for persistent hemothorax.
A diagnostic peritoneal lavage was performed which was positive by visual inspection and he was subsequently taken to the operating room urgently for an exploratory laparotomy.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no crepitus.
Neck:  No hematoma, cervical collar.
Genitourinary:  No blood a the urethral meatus.
Back:  No step-offs.
Extremities:  No obvious deformities, 2+ dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial and radial pulses bilaterally.
RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  Chest x-ray showed an endotracheal tube which was not visualized on the radiograph due to superior and malpositioning; nasogastric tube was coiled in the upper esophagus.
Bilateral chest tubes were present, bilateral small pneumothoraces and a persistent left hemothorax was identified.
Fractures of the left first through sixth ribs were seen with posterior fractures of ribs five and six being displaced.
Subcutaneous emphysema was noticed.
There was no free air on the AP pelvis.
There was a suspicious area for fracture along the right sacrum.
CT of the head without contrast showed two punctate areas of high density within the right frontal cortex consistent with contusion.
There was effacement of the sulci and cisterns consistent with increased intracranial pressure.
CT of the cervical spine showed no cervical spine fractures, fractures of the left first rib and right T1 transverse process were seen.
CAT scan of the abdomen was performed post splenectomy and showed mottled enhancement, small bowel loops and liver likely due to reflux and hyperemia after an episode of hypotension.
CT of the chest with contrast showed no evidence of aortic tear or dissection, a slight increased density to the mediastinal fat consistent with hematoma, no pericardial effusions, dense opacification of both lungs dependently.
CT of the pelvis showed the urinary bladder was collapsed.
Bone windows demonstrated fracture of the right transverse process of C1, left ribs one through six with rib five being fractured twice; the tip of L3, left transverse process fracture, fracture through the right sacrum and a nondisplaced fracture through the right superior pubic ramus.
A repeat CAT scan on [**2125-2-13**] demonstrated three punctate areas of hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter interface with basically unchanged CAT scan.
A CT of the abdomen on [**2125-2-17**] demonstrated bilateral consolidation of the lower lobes of the lung with left greater than right, a small amount of free fluid in the gastrohepatic region but no evidence of abscess or other fluid collection.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the emergency room Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a left scalp laceration stapled.
The neurosurgery service was consulted at the time of operation for urgent intracranial pressure monitoring given that Mr. [**Known lastname **] did not receive a head CAT scan and had an altered mental status.
There were no other significant findings at the time of surgery.
In the intensive care unit a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to monitor his cardiac filling pressures.
Also on the day of admission the orthopedic surgery service was consulted to evaluate for multiple fractures including transverse process fractures and pelvic fractures.
He was also vaccinated post splenectomy for meningococcus and pneumococcus and H. flu.
A sputum culture had Gram positive cocci.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to have a fever while on the floor as high as 102.8 and his white blood cell count rose from 11.4 to 14.
There was concern for an intra-abdominal abscess given his recent surgery.
On [**2125-2-17**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a CT of his abdomen which showed no abscess and some nonspecific hyperperfusion of the right liver and also bibasilar consolidation in his lungs.
Subsequent cultures were negative, while he did have some Gram negative rods in his sputum.
