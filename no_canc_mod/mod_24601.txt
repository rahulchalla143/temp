HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: Mr. [**Known lastname 86585**] is a 78 year-old man with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and paroxysmal atrial flutter who was admitted to the NP service for pulmonary vein isolation, which was performed today by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19911**].
He was doing well post-procedure with a plan for discharge in the morning, but tonight became bradycardic to the 40s and hypotensive to the 70s-80s from a baseline SBP of 125.
At 9:15 pm he had a 7.2 second pause on telemtry followed by a junctional rhythm, and noted that he "felt funny" and nauseous during this time.
Fifteen minutes later he had tachycardia with prolonged PR interval followed by a 5.2 second pause captured on EKG.
Of note, his atrial flutter stems from [**2179-10-9**] after an initiall episode of syncope.
In [**Month (only) **] of this year he had another episode of syncope and underwent flutter ablation at [**Hospital3 **] hospital.
A few days later he had another episode of syncope that was thought to be vasovagal and his Rhythmol and Atenolol were discontinued.
However, on [**2181-2-1**] he presented to the hospital again with rapid atrial fibrillation so the medications were restarted.
He denies pain, SOB, but has +palpitations and mild ankle swelling.
+ for constipation.
On arrival to the CCU, he is comfortable and free of chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations.
Labs were significant for hyperkalemia and anemia.
Past Medical History: Chronic atrial fibrillation Atrial flutter s/p RFA [**2181-1-12**] at CCH Dyslipidemia Hypertension Syncope [**10-15**].
Stress testing suspicious.
Had atrial fibrillation (alcohol indusced?).
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
split S 2 LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No femoral bruits.
dressing in right groin C/D/I without hematoma or bruit SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

# Sinus pauses/arrhythmia: Pauses occur after tachycardia?
Pt slightly symptomatic subjectively, but also having hypotension with bradycardia.
Sinus node fibrosis and arterial atherosclerosis also on the differential.
The CCU team decided to reduce his nodal blockade by discontinuing his atenolol and reducing diltiazem 240mg PO Daily to 240mg PO QOD then 120mg PO Daily.
If he's still having pauses or if he develops significant tachycardias from reduced nodal blockade, he will most likely need a pacemaker in the near future.
# Chronic atrial fibrillation: status post pulmonary vein isolation.
Telemetry shows normal sinus rythym with PACs, versus multifocal atrial tachycardia followed by sinus pauses.
Pt failed prior atrial ablation and trial without nodal blocking agents.
# Hyper/hypotension: Pt has been hypotensive in the setting of pauses/bradycardia.
# Dyslipidemia: Continued simvastatin  # Anemia: Likely from procedure today as well as hemodilution.
In the CCU the pt was no longer bradycardic and therefore did not want to overcorrect potassium.

You were admitted a pulmonary vein isoloation (PVI) for recurrent atrial fibrillation.
You developed some pauses in your heart rate after the procedure, which is why you came to the cardiac intensive care unit (CCU).
If you continue to have significant pauses or if you have symptoms with the pauses you will most likely need a pacemaker in the future.
You will be instructed on how to use this properly, which will help us monitor you for any pauses or other rhythm problems.
