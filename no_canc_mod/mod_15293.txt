Prenatal screens revealed blood type B positive, antibody negative, Rubella immune, rapid plasma reagin nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and group B strep status unknown.
Rupture of membranes occurred prematurely on [**2116-7-23**].
There was also bleeding at that time with concern placenta previa.
The mother was delivered on [**2116-9-7**] by cesarean section due to concern for chorioamnionitis.
The infant emerged with poor respiratory effort.
Skin examination revealed no rashes or petechia.
Good tone; consistent with gestational age.
His respiratory distress persisted, and he was electively intubated and received one dose of surfactant.
He had several episodes of spontaneous apnea and bradycardia.
A soft murmur was noted in the second week of life.
This was thought to be benign in nature and consistent with peripheral pulmonic stenosis.
His complete blood counts were markedly abnormal with low absolute neutrophil counts.
The blood culture was no growth.
HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  As noted, the infant had markedly abnormal complete blood counts.
The etiology of the neutropenia was thought to be due to the prolong rupture of membranes and the mother's chorioamnionitis.
GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  The infant required treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy.
These were thought to be associated with breast milk jaundice.
There were no neurological concerns at the time of discharge.
(2) born between 32 and 35 weeks gestation with 2/3 of the following; with plans for day care during respiratory syncytial virus season, with a smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities, or with preschool siblings; and/or (3) with chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the Fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age, the family and other care givers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
Respiratory distress syndrome.
Apnea of prematurity.
Congenital neutropenia.
