His pain level their was requiring high levels of narcotics.
He also was noted to be in renal failure with hyperkalemia.
He underwent a CT abd without contrast (due to ARF) there which did not reveal an acute process.
Due to his high pain levels, ARF and enlarged mediastinum on CXR he was sent here for MRI due to concern for aortic dissection.
He had an elevated BUN/Cr, hyperkalemia to 6.
No hyperkalemic ECG changes.
This could also be seen on OSH CT. Had a bedside u/s of LUQ on ED, noted to be a poor study, no acute etiology/pericardial effusion visualized.
2mg of dilaudid for pain control in addition to aformentioned hyperkalemia tx.
He was transferred to the MICU service for his hypoxia as well as being somewhat hypotensive, with systolic BPs in high 80s.
He was reported as initially somnolent, thought to be due to narcotics at OSH (morphine 18mg + Dilaudid 4mg), when pain controlled was comfortable, when narcotics wore off was SOB, grunting, tachycardic.
VS at time of transfer were: Afebrile 89/50 96% on NRB 18 HR 97  .

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No acute abdominal/pelvic pathology identified.
While non-contrast evaluation of the aorta is unremarkable, evaluation for dissection is limited without contrast.
Moderately enlarged prostate.
[**2185-1-8**] - chest x-ray IMPRESSION: While atelectasis may represent a componet of the bibasilar opacity, pneumonia cannot be excluded; particularly on the left.
No evidence of obstruction, renal mass, or nephrolithiasis.
[**2185-1-10**] LENI No evidence for deep vein thrombosis in the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral or popliteal veins.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 61M with HTN, HL who presents with severe LUQ pain, acute on chronic renal failure and a possible pneumonia.
# Respiratory distress: Transfered from [**Hospital 81171**] hospital hypoxic with a respiratory acidosis, likly from splinting, underlying OSA, and narcotics.
His story is also concerning for PE, but negative LENI, and his conditon improved on antibiotics.
CTA was considered by impossible with renal failure, and VQ scan not useful with possible pneumonia.
Day #1 post discharge- pts blood cultures 2/4 were positive for Gram positive rods (cornebacterium and propiobacterium).
The flora were felt to be most likely secondary to a skin contaminate and given pts clinical improvment, no adjustment to his antibiotics was felt necessary.
Pt was notified to return to the ER if ongoing fevers, chills, lightheadedness, or worsening of his symptoms.
# LUQ pain.
CEs negative with no ischemia on ECG.
D-dimer elevated which is concerning for PE but pain and oxygenation has greatly improved and LENI negative as noted above.
On discharge pt is without chest pain.
Admitted physicians considered pericardial effusion vs hypotension and tachycardia due to sepsis or PE.
TTE was negative for effusion.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure - atrophic kidneys on CT, has chronic kidney disease, baseline Cr 2.1, now 2.5 down from 4.4.
Renal ultrasound was normal making post renal obstruction and renal artery dissection less likely.
# HTN - on lisinopril/HCTZ at home, which was for now given renal failure.
# HL ??????
# Anemia- Mild, normocytic, new after admission and rehydration.
# OSA: Obstructive Sleep Apnea- Chronic, was given CPAP with home machine, but pt refused treatment during parts of stay.
