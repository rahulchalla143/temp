Admission Date:  [**2142-11-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-11-23**]  Date of Birth:  [**2058-2-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 25936**] Chief Complaint: Hypotnsion and altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2142-11-20**] - Right internal jugular central line placement [**2142-11-20**] - Started on vasopressors  History of Present Illness: 84F h/o dilated cardiomyopathy (non-ischemic, last echo in [**2138**] with ef of 15%, mild MR, diffused hypokinesis), Afib on coumadin, history of PE, who was transferred from [**Hospital1 392**] with hypotension, altered mental status, lethargy, confusion, otherwise without chest pain and with some mild shortness of breath.
CXR and Echo noted to have dilated cardiomyopathy.
Of note, she was recently started on levothyroxin on [**10-29**] for TSH of 17, also reportedly was having continous congnitive decline for the past year.
She was noted to have hypothyroidism with TSH of 17, told to start levoxyl 75 and titrate.
She underwent a bedside echo at ED showed poor squeeze, CXR was notable for LLL consolidation and cardiomegaly and CT head was negative for intracranial lesions.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: - Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, - Hypertension 2.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Atrial Fibrillation on coumadin  Anemia  Hypothyroidism  Memory loss/Dementia  Congestive Cardiomyopathy  CHF (Congestive Heart Failure)  Pure Hypercholesterolemia  Pulmonary Embolism  Chronic Renal Failure baseline Cr.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
distant heart sounds.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
mild accessory muscle use.
CTAB, b/l base crackles, no wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
3+ pitting edema to the knee.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated with severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are moderately thickened with moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a large pericardial effusion which appears loculated in the area of the right ventricular free wall.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Severely dilated left ventricle with severe global hypokinesis.
Moderately dilated right ventricle with moderate free wall hypokinesis.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Left base consolidation, likely representing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
The differential diagnosis includes an obstructive mass, or large pulmonary embolus.
Mild cardiac decompensation.
-CXR ([**2142-11-20**]) - Previous pulmonary vascular congestion has decreased.
Small right and small-to-moderate left pleural effusion persist and partially obscure what could be areas of consolidation in both lower lungs.
Fullness in the mediastinum in the region of the pulmonary outflow tract raises the possibility of pulmonary hypertension.
In addition to a possibility of pneumonia in both lower lobes, particularly the left, clinical attention should be paid to the possibility of pericardial effusion, although I see no evidence of elevated central venous pressure by way of mediastinal widening.
Right internal jugular introducer ends at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins.
There is no pneumothorax.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Extensive opacification of the left maxillary sinus, is concerning for inverted papilloma, though a sinonasal polyp might also have this appearance; dense appearance can relate to soft tissue contents, dense contents with/without blood products.
Discharge labs:  Brief Hospital Course: 84F h/o dilated cardiomyopathy (non-ischemic, EF=15%), Afib on coumadin, history of PE, who was transferred from [**Hospital1 392**] with hypotension, altered mental status, lethargy, confusion.
#Cardiogenic shock/hypotension - There was initial concern for cardiogenic vs septic shock at presentation.
A cordis was placed with the goal of performing a right heart cath to better differentiate distributive vs cardiogenic shock.
Central venous O2 sat was in the mid 60s, which also argues against septic shock.
Given that worsening CHF and cardiogenic shock were though to be the cause of her hypotension, she was started on a Lasix drip which was titrated up to 30mg/hr and was also started on metolazone 5mg daily in order to achieve effective duiresis.
Repeat TTE showed severe global left ventricular hypokinesis and EF=15%.
# Pneumonia/Possible septic shock - As discussed above, pneumonia with septic shock was entertained during this admission as a potential etiology for her hypotension.
During this admission, she had a cough productive of yellow sputum which added to the concern for pneumonia.
#Altered mental status - Etiology remained unclear, head CT during this admission showed no acute intracranial process.
MS was likely worsened by her hypotension and potential infection, which were treated with pressors and antibiotics, respectively.
She has underlying dementia and Aricept was stopped because of concern that it was exacerbating her ectopy on telemetry.
#Acute on chronic renal failure - Thought to be related to poor forward flow from her global LV hypokinesis and cardiogenic shock.
Diuresis was attempted in order to optimize her hemodynamics given her severe CHF.
Her Cr remained stable at 1.9-2.1 during this admission, which is slightly elevated from her baseline of 1.7.
# Afib with LBBB - Her rate remained well controlled, she was not on beta blockers at home and none were given during this admission [**1-10**] hypotension.
There was concern for liver dysfunction/congestion given her severe CHF, but LFTs were normal and albumin was normal, suggesting adequate synthetic function.
She did not have any evidence of bleeding during her admission.
# Rash - She had an erythematous maculopapular rash on her LEs at admission.
# Hypothyroidism - TSH elevated to 9.8 at admission, T3 was low and T4 was normal.
#Hyperlipidemia - She was continued on simvastatin during admission, which will be stopped at the time of discharge because of her transition to hospice.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: Old [**Hospital **] Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: Cardiogenic shock Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure Pneumonia Secondary diagnoses: Hyperlipidemia Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - always.
You were admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit because of altered mental status and low blood pressure.
We also treated you for pneumonia with IV antibitoics.
