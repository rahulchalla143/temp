There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, mass effect, hydrocephalus, or acute major vascular territorial infarction.
There are small fluid levels in the left maxillary sinus and left sphenoid sinus air cell.
There is no concerning osseous or surrounding soft tissue abnormality.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage, evidence of cerebral edema or acute major vascular territorial infarction.
There is associated compressive atelectasis of the dependent lower lobes.
The gallbladder appears to be intact with normal wall enhancement and no evidence of cholelithiasis or appreciable wall thickening.
A small amount of fluid layers around the liver into [**Location (un) 6813**] pouch.
There are bilateral subcentimeter scattered hypodensities of each kidney which are too small to characterize but probably cysts.
Evaluation of the large and small bowel is limited without oral contrast.
Intraluminal fluid is noted throughout the entire colon as well as several loops of small bowel.
There is pancolonic wall thickening.
There is no evidence of obstruction or focally dilated loops.
BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lesions are seen.
No CT evidence of gallbladder perforation.
Findings on ultrasound probably relate to the presence of small amount of free fluid surrounding the liver and extending into the gallbladder fossa in combination with partial imaging of adjacent fluid filled colon.
Pancolonic wall thickening consistent with colitis.
Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the left.
There is no evidence of thoracic aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism.
No pericardial effusion is seen.
The lungs are grossly clear, with only minimal dependent atelectasis and no focal consolidation (note that the full lung bases are included only on the low-dose acquisition).
No pleural effusion is seen.
A few non- pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes identified.
This examination is not tailored for detailed evaluation of subdiaphragmatic regions.
The visualized portions of the liver, spleen and stomach are grossly unremarkable, with no extreme upper abdominal ascites.
Osseous structures are unremarkable without suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion identified.
There is suggestion of a rounded 2 cm low-attenuation lesion within the left lobe of the thyroid.
No acute cardiopulmonary p rocess identified.
Specifically, no evidence of dissection or other acute aortic process, or PE.
Suggestion of cystic nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid.
Recommend correlation with physical exam and [**Name (NI) 13416**], when feasible (given the patient's clinical presentation, is there any possibility of underlying thyroid, or adrenal, disease?).
FINDINGS: In comparison with earlier study of this date, there is little overall change in the diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications that only spare the left lower lung.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] was a 54 y/o female admitted for hypotension to SBP 70-80s.
Many of these were added or discontinued during her course as there was no isolated organism other than influenza.
During her hospital stay patient has a persistent tachycardia that did not respond to fluids, antibiotics, analgesics, beta-blockers, or anxiolytics.
She developed increasing oxygen requirements during her hospitalization.
On [**3-9**] She had to be intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
She continued to have an acidemia from this point until her death.
During this point in time her antibiotic coverage was broadened to Meropenem and Vancomycin to cover possible gram negative respiratory nosocomial infections as well as Flagyl to cover colonic anaerobes as pt was noted to have dilated colon on xrays, and likely illeus.
At this point patient developed an increasing leukocytosis from 17 on the [**3-7**] to 27 on [**3-10**].
No elevation in lactates.
No free air in abdomen.
Pt was noted to have pleural effusions.
The plan was to tap these as soon as pt was stable to rule out empyema.
On [**3-10**], given patients worsening ARDS, and recent extubation it was felt that her lung function might improve if she was started on prone ventilation.
Immediately following her transfer to the prone bed, pt developed hypotension to the SBP of 50s while receiving maximum levophed and neosynephrine.
She died of hypoxic respiratory failure consistent with ARDS.
The ARDS was probably secondary to influenza pneumonia.
