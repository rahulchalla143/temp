Emergent left craniectomy for SDH and bolt placement 2.
Neuro:  Mental Status: No response to voice or noxious stimuli.
No response to supraorbital pressure.
Facial symmetry could not be adequately assessed due to intubation but no overt droop.
Reflexes: B T Br Pa Ac Right     2 2  2  2  2 Left      2 2  2  2  2  Toes mute bilaterally   Pertinent Results: Head CT([**6-26**]): NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD: There is a left convexity left subdural hematoma measuring up to 8 mm from the left inner table.
There is a right occipital cephalohematoma with associated contrecoup injury in the left frontal lobe with edema noted diffusely through the brain parenchyma although more prominent in the left frontal lobe.
There is a 10-mm left-to-right midline shift.
There is subarachnoid blood in the basal cisterns.
Bone windows demonstrate no evidence of acute fracture.
Head CT([**6-27**]): NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD: There is a new right convexity epidural hematoma extending up to 2.1 cm from the inner table.
There is associated right uncal herniation with the uncus abutting and exerting mass effect on the brainstem.
Diffuse brain edema is again noted with areas of subarachnoid blood, unchanged.
Post-craniectomy changes are noted in the left convexity with subcutaneous air that is within the spectrum of post-surgical change.
There is a 7-mm leftward midline shift noted.
Head CT [**6-28**]: Since the prior study, there appears to be essentially complete evacuation of the right middle cranial fossa epidural hematoma, with resolution of previously noted leftward subfalcine herniation.
The large left-sided craniectomy defect is again noted.
There is no hydrocephalus.
Lastly, there is a probable minimal degree of pneumocephalus within the former site of the right epidural hematoma.
Overall stable post-surgical changes from prior right craniotomy and epidural hematoma evacuation, and left craniectomy.
No new intracranial hemorrhage.
Subtle area of focal hypodensity in the right thalamus could possibly represent an area of evolving infarction.
CT HEAD [**7-6**]  FINDINGS: Post-surgical changes from prior right craniotomy, with evacuation of right middle cranial fossa epidural hematoma and large left craniectomy are similar.
No new intracranial hemorrhage or infarct.
There has been interval resolution of the pneumocephalus.
New intracranial hemorrhage.
NOTE ON ATTENDING REVIEW:  There is a change in the configuration of the left cerebral hemisphere part of which is protruding contour but likely within the confines of the flap and can relate to herniation or expansion of the brain.
As before, there is some degree of cerebral edema.
Hypodense areas noted in the bifrontal and left occipital lobes related to previously noted acute infarcts.
Thin right sided subdural hemorrhage is unchanged.
[**7-6**] BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower extremities.
Labs on discharge [**2167-7-7**] WBC 7.5, Hgb, 10.5*, Hct 30.4*, Plt 679*       Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted for head trauma with left subdural and subarachnoid bleeds with left hemispheric edema and uncal herniation.
Patient was emergently taken to the OR for caminio bolt placement and left craniectomy for relief of high ICP and evacuation of a small SDH.
A post-operative head CT showed the development of a new right epidural hematoma.
A post-op head CT showed essentially complete evacuation of the right middle cranial fossa epidural hematoma, with resolution of previously noted leftward subfalcine herniation.
His neuro exam continued to improve daily, with R>L withdrawal progressing to purposeful movement on the right.
His left upper and lower extremity was largely plegic, but at times he moved his RUE spontaneously and with withdrawal to pain.
He ran a fever form most of his post-operative course, with no clear source.
His urine and blood cultures have been negative, and there was no clear evidence of an aspiration PNA.
We suspected a dilantin-induced fever and was therefore switched to keppra on [**2167-7-2**].
He was spiking fevers but no source wasfound via CXR, urine cultures, blood cultures and lower extremity dopplers.
Pupils reactive with minimal subconjunctival hemmorrhages laterally bilaterally.
Artificial Tear with Lanolin 0.1-0.1 % Ointment Sig: One (1) Appl Ophthalmic PRN (as needed).
Docusate Sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for fever or pain.
Elevated ICP s/p bolt placement   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: General Instructions  ??????
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
