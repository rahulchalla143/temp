Admission Date:  [**2131-12-12**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-12-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2064-7-22**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath, bilateral PEs, referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible lysis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 67 y/o M history of unprovoked PE, gout, p/w shortness of breath found to have PE and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible clot lysis.
72 hours after last viral symptoms pt was climbing stairs in the house and reported sensation of dyspnea highly reminiscent of the experience with his last pulmonary embolism.
PCP found [**Name9 (PRE) **] positive, pt went to the ED at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] and found to have pulmonary embolism involving all branches of left and right pulmonary arteries, also found to have pulmonary hypertension.
ECG without evidence of strain.
Echo also showed moderate pulmonary hypertension, mildly dilated right ventricle with preserved systolic function, normal LV function.
PT was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible clot lysis in the CCU.

DDimer/Fibrinogen: [**2131-12-11**] 03:35PM BLOOD D-Dimer-7088* [**2131-12-12**] 08:40PM BLOOD D-Dimer-3915* [**2131-12-13**] 06:25AM BLOOD D-Dimer-4062* [**2131-12-12**] 08:40PM BLOOD Fibrino-451* [**2131-12-13**] 04:00AM BLOOD Fibrino-398  STUDIES: - ECG: [**2131-12-12**] at [**Hospital1 **]:  multifocal appearance of P waves in II suggesting possible wandering atrial pacemaker or PACs.
Otherwise no signs of RV strain (no tall R waves v1 or v2, no right axis deviation, no inverted T waves in precordial leads).
No ST changes or signs of ischemia.
- ECHO:  [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]: echo with moderate pulmonary hypertension, mildly dilated R ventricle with preserved systolic fn, normal LV function.
CT chest at [**Location (un) 620**] read as: evidence of ventricular septal bulge and pulmonary embolism involving all branches of the left and right pulmonary arteries along with pulmonary artery hypertension.
Ground glass opacity in the left upper lobe which may represent infectious or ischemic etiology.
3 mm nodule in right upper lobe.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated right ventricle with evidence of mild hypokinesis of the RV free wall.
At least mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The degree of tricuspid regurgitation has decreased.
The degree of pulmonary hypertension is similar.
There is non-occlusive thrombus seen within the right popliteal vein extending into one of the right peroneal veins.
The right posterior tibial veins appear patent.
Normal flow and compression is seen in the right femoral and common femoral veins.
Occlusive thrombus is also seen within the left popliteal vein and the amount of thrombus is slightly greater on the right.
This thrombus appears to extend into the left posterior tibial veins, and possibly into the left peroneal veins.
Normal flow and compression is seen in the left femoral and common femoral veins.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 y/o M history of unprovoked PE, gout, p/w shortness of breath found to have bilateraly PEs and lower extremity DVTs distal to popliteal veins, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible clot lysis.
Pt found to have bilateral PEs in all branches of left and right pulmonary arteries.
Remained hemodynamically stable throughout - no hypoxia or hypotension, normal WBC, afebrile, no troponin elevation, no evidence of RV strain on ECG.
Still, pt was noted to have evidence of pulmonary hypertension with PA pressures roughly ~50.
This PAH could reasonably be explained by acute setting of PE, although presentation with emboli in so many locations suggested a more chronic process.
pt now with 2nd occurrence of unprovoked pulmonary embolism.
Although pt was in bed for [**1-11**] days with norovirus this seemed to be an incredible and diffuse clot burden to simply be explained by that level of immobility.
Particularly given second episode, c/f underlying malignancy or hypercoagulable state.
Pt did have precancerous polyps on recent colonoscopy per his report however these were removed and found in the very recent past.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible clot lysis.
The thought would have been to consider lysis now to prevent future RV dysfunction given that pt already had evidence of PAH, but this was decided against.
Pt without family history of PE or blood clots.
Without recent surgery or prolonged airline travel, although spent 2-3 days primarily in bed roughly 1 week prior to admission with norovirus.
Pt was without calf tenderness or lower extremity edema, although LE dopplers showed DVTs distal to the popliteal veins in both lower extremities.
# RHYTHM:  ECG with evidence of multiform p waves, most likely PACs but differential included wandering pacer.
ECG with no evidence of right heart strain.
Pt was monitored on telemetry without events.
# HTN - no history of htn.
Pt without evidence of hypotension throughout hospital course.
#Ground glass opacity on chest CT - found on presentation to [**Location (un) 620**].
Nodule located in left upper lobe, possibly representing infectious/ischemic etiology.
with PE it is certainly possible pt had infarcted small peripheral area of the lung, however HDS and this lesion [**Last Name (un) **] hemodynamically/clinically insignificant at the time.
Very low suspicion for infection as pt without cough and afebrile.
Pt was monitored without issues.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 1) needs outpt f/u CT scan for pulm nodule noted on CTA chest.
In setting of recurrent PEs there must be heightened concern for malignancy (although pt without smoking history and only with one small nodule, most likely incidental and benign) 2) pt should have referral to heme/onc on DC, given this is his second episode of PE unprovoked  Medications on Admission: HOME MEDICATIONS: folic acid 1 tab daily dose unspecified colchicine 0.6 mg daily allopurinol 100 mg daily .
Discharge Instructions: You had a pulmonary embolus, a large blood clot in your lungs.
You had trouble breathing and increased pressures in your lungs because of this clot.
