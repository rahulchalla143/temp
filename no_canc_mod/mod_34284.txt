Balloon aortic valvuloplasty.
History of Present Illness: 81F with critical calcific AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.7cm2), AF on coumadin (last dose 2/17), s/p PPM for [**5-16**] for bradycardia/prolonged QT admitted for IV heparin therapy prior to scheduled percutaneous AVR scheduled for Tues [**1-29**].
The patient describes that she has been becoming progressively short of breath over the last few months.
She denies any chest pain, palpitations, nausea, diaphoresis associated with her shortness of breath with exertion.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - L femur fracture s/p ORIF on [**2113-5-2**] - AS, valve area 0.7 on TTE in [**11-15**] - Acute on chronic Diastolic CHF - Atrial fibrillation - [**Date Range **] rotator cuff (left) - pulmonary hypertension - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - History of GI bleeding [**10-16**] upper and lower endoscopy with no findings.
Coumadin  was discontinued, but eventually resumed with no subsequent bleeding.
- Carotid Stenosis/ 80-99% right carotid stenosis, 60-69% left carotid stenosis.
- h/o Delirium - R eye blindness  Social History: The patient lives with her daughter ([**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 23925**]) and 4 grandchildren in [**Hospital1 6930**], MA.
At home, [**Hospital1 **] help with her medications.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-1-31**], the right ventricle is probably slightly more dilated and hypokinetic than on prior study (the RV was probably mildly dilated and hypokinetic on the prior study, although reported as normal).
Degree of tricuspid regurgitation is similar.

Brief Hospital Course: 81F with PMH aortic stenosis presents for percutaneous aortic valve replacement.
Pt was admitted preoperatively on [**1-27**] for heart failure optimization and IV heparin bridge.
Balloon aortic valvuloplasty.
A repeat urine culture revealed a subsequent urinary tract infection with ESCHERICHIA COLI.
