Admission Date:  [**2164-10-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2164-11-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2107-3-17**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57 year old woman with a history of viral myocarditis at age 11 as well as a history of multiple abdominal surgeries including a Billroth II procedure, partial vagotomy and partial gastrectomy in [**2153**].
She had a Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy for poor gastric emptying in [**2156**].
The patient also presented with eight days of nausea, vomiting and weakness as well as decreased p.o.
On electrocardiogram at the time of admission she had marked ST elevations of 5 cm in V3 through V6.
Her left ventriculogram showed an ejection fraction of 35% of unknown origin although the patient has a history of viral myocarditis at age 11.
The patient had multiple echocardiograms during her admission which showed an ejection fraction of around 20 to 22% with severe global hypokinesis and a normal left ventricular size, also 3+ tricuspid regurgitation.
After this, the patient continued to have nausea, vomiting and developed abdominal pain.
Then she began to have peritoneal signs as well as coffee ground emesis.
She had a computerized tomography scan of the abdomen which showed free air as well as free fluid in the abdominal cavity.
At that time they noted a perforation of her previous jejunojejunostomy secondary to an adhesive obstruction.
Procedure performed was a small bowel resection with reanastomosis of various parts of the small bowel as well as adhesiolysis.
During the procedure, there were some small bowel contents filled into the intra-abdominal cavity and a Swan-Ganz catheter was placed.
The Surgery Intensive Care Unit course was notable for worsening cardiomyopathy as well as a large fluid requirement.
Then the patient began to develop ascites, bilateral pleural effusions as well as congestive heart failure.
They performed thoracentesis of both the left and right pleural space, both which were sterile without evidence of infection.
She first developed a pneumonia with Senna Trepomonas.
On [**10-18**], her sputum culture revealed 2+ Senna Trepomonas which was Levofloxacin sensitive as well as 2+ yeast.
After that she was extubated, however, ended up being reintubated three days later because of increasing secretions.
They did more sputum cultures on [**10-22**] and then she grew out Senna Trepomonas as well as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The patient also began to have some diarrhea.
Multiple abdominal surgeries as in history of present illness.
Peptic ulcer disease.
Viral myocarditis at age 11.
Fioricet  ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to Sulfa and gentamicin.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a clinical psychologist and has a history of eating disorders as well as possible abuse of psychotropic medications.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen:  She has decreased bowel sounds, however, she was soft, nondistended with mild left lower quadrant tenderness.
No rigidity or guarding.
Extremities:  She had no edema and 2+ pulses bilaterally.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus with a rate of 100, left axis deviation, ST elevations inferiorly as well as V3 through V6 of up to [**Street Address(2) 32524**] depression V1 through V2.
Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 25%, severe global hypokinesis, decreased left ventricular function and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
Arterial blood gases at that time on those settings was 7.49, 3.8, 156, 30.
Urine cultures had evidence of yeast and her stool was positive for Clostridium difficile on [**10-23**], negative for Clostridium difficile times five on all other testings.
The patient was transferred to us with her main issue being failure to wean from ventilator as well as question of how to best manage her congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy.
She also at that time was reported to have increased white count and glucose as well as a history of anxiety and benzodiazepine addiction.
Throughout her six days on our service her heart failure remained very well compensated with no evidence of pulmonary congestion or lower extremity edema.
She had some slightly liquid stools, therefore we changed her tube feeds to a tube feed with more fiber.
