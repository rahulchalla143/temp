Admission Date:  [**2115-2-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2115-3-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-12-2**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Amoxicillin / Latex  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10293**] Chief Complaint: transferred for further managment of probable hepatorenal syndrome   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: nasogastric tube placed  History of Present Illness: This is a 46 year old female with a past medical history of pancreatitis and alcoholic liver disease who presented to [**Location (un) 21541**] Hospital on [**2115-2-18**] with a complaint of abdominal pain.
The patient reports that her pain had gradually been getting worse over the three weeks prior to her presentation.
At the time of her admission, the pt was found to have acute hepatitis and was thought to be mildly encephalopathic.
The leading diagnostic consideration was alcoholic hepatitis; the patient denied APAP consumption and there was little evidence to support another etiology (though it is unclear whether she has had an infectious work-up).
She was also found to have an elevated WBC count of 20; it does not appear that she was febrile at that time.
The renal service was consulted; ddx was felt to include a pre-renal, ATN or HRS.
The patient was also noted to have low-grade temps.
The CXR was read as showing bilateral pneumonia, although the feeling of the transferring physician was that this was inconsistent with the patient's clinical picture.
She denies any fevers or chills.
No nausea or vomiting; some abd pain as outlined above.
No loose, dark or red stools.
No urinary sxs.
No MSK or neuro complaints.
Past Medical History: pancreatitis in [**2108**] EtOH abuse; reportedly has not beeing drinking since [**12-24**] anxiety depression known ascities x 5 months HPV anorexia/bulemia s/p c-section  Social History: The patient smokes [**1-18**] ppd.
Family History: One uncle with HTN and renal disease on HD.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
ABD: Soft, mildly distended.
TTP over the RUQ, but no R/G.
Mild hepatomegaly, liver span ~14 cm.
Mild edema.

Cirrhotic liver, marked hepatomegaly, and severe portal hypertension.
Moderate ascites.
Due to marked hepatomegaly, the presence of an ostomy in the right lower quadrant, and the distribution of peritoneal fluid, a safe spot for bedside paracentesis was not identified.
Small gallstones without acute cholecystitis.
Brief Hospital Course: This was a 45 year old female with known alcoholic liver disease transferred from OSH and determined to have acute on chronic alcoholic liver disease, as well as, hepatorenal syndrome and pneumonia.
# Acute on chronic alcoholic hepatitis: Patient was not a candidate for transplant given her last reported alcohol was in [**12-24**].
She was treated with intravenous steroids up until she developed respiratory distress and was made CMO by her family in the ICU.
Patient's acute hepatitis was further complicated by her hepatorenal syndrome and likely pneumonia.
Prior to developing respiratory distress patient was already severely encephalopathic.
ABG demonstrated worsening acute metabolic acidosis.
Diuresis was attempted in given suspicion for pulmonary edema without good effect.
# Hepatorenal Syndrome: Acute renal failure consistent with HRS.
# Encephalopathy: Patient's encephalopathy worsened quickly from time of admission to hospital day 2.
# Pneumonia: Patient found to have a bilateral pneumonia.
The patient passed away on [**2115-3-3**] from respiratory failure as an immediate cause of death and acute on chronic alcoholic hepatitis as her primary cause of death.
