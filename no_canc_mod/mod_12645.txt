Admission Date:  [**2109-7-24**]     Discharge Date: [**2109-8-1**]  Date of Birth:   [**2046-6-13**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Hospital1 212**] HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year old female with a complicated history including Sjogren's syndrome and a hip replacement [**2109-4-16**].
Her immediate postoperative course was complicated by a right thigh hematoma requiring evacuation, renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis and right leg neurologic deficit.
She was discharged to rehabilitation on [**2109-5-3**], but was readmitted on [**2109-5-9**], for recurrence of the right thigh hematoma.
Cultures from this evacuation grew Staphylococcus epidermidis and extended spectrum lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae requiring removal of the right hip prosthesis and placement of a cement spacer on [**2109-5-20**], which subsequently fractured.
She had a prior history of deep vein thrombosis and is documented to have an antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
She developed a painful neuropathy in her right foot since the original operation on [**2109-4-16**], which has been controlled with Neurontin.
She has developed pressure ulcers on her sacral decubitus and bilateral heels, having been bedridden since [**Month (only) 116**] of this year.
In addition, she had symptoms of depression and adjustment disorder and was started on Ritalin and Remeron with good response.
Her stay at rehabilitation was notable for hypercalcemia treated with intravenous Lasix and intravenous fluids, Klebsiella urinary tract infection and was found to be Clostridium difficile positive on [**2109-7-17**], for which she was started on Flagyl.
One week prior to admission and 1-2 weeks after completing her antibiotic course her right hip was aspiration to document clearance of the infection with reportedly negative cultures.
Review of systems on admission was positive for diarrhea for about one week with associated abdominal cramping.
She denied fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, nausea, vomiting or dysphagia.
Spinal stenosis with sciatica since [**2108-11-27**].
Anemia 6.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction, angioplasty in [**2102**].
Three vessel disease on cath at [**Hospital 4415**] [**2102**] 7.
Peripheral vascular disease- s/p embolectomies and angioplasties for embolic disease as well.
Right congenital renal agenesis?.
Chronic renal failure- although creatine ~.7- 1.0 she is bed bound and has little muscle mass 11.
She has a remote history of smoking and alcohol use and has no history of drug abuse.
In general, she was lying flat in bed, obese, appears comfortable lying still, in no acute distress.
Slightly dry eyes and oropharynx.
The neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular - Distant heart sounds, normal S1 and S2, no audible extra sounds.
The abdomen reveals normoactive bowel sounds, obese, nondistended, soft, nontender, no masses.
No lower extremity asymmetrical edema.
Immediate postoperative period was complicated by hypotesnion, tachycardia with low grade temperatures and an elevated white blood cell count to 34.0.
On review of her medical records from [**Hospital3 2737**] the path report states that the right hip had acute osteomyelitis rather than AVN from [**2109-4-17**].
She had an echocardiogram on [**2109-7-26**], which showed an ejection fraction of 55%, normal left atrium and left ventricle, possible mild aortic stenosis, trivial mitral regurgitation, but the study was noted to be limited by patient tolerance.
Hematology - The patient has a complicated coagulation history that includes multiple deep vein thromboses on coagulation with a reported antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, but also multiple hematomas of her right hip.
We titrated her Lovenox by checking a Factor X-A level and at this time, she is on Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneous twice a day with no complications.
An anemia workup was done that was most consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
The patient's iron supplementation was discontinued due to a highly elevated ferritin level suggesting good iron stores.
An Epo level is pending at this time, but the patient was started on Epo 5,000 units three times per week for high suspicion of erythropoietin deficiency secondary to chronic renal insufficiency.
Infectious disease - The patient was empirically started on Vancomycin and Meropenem initially after the operation for suspicion of sepsis given her hypotension and low grade fevers.
These were discontinued when she was transferred to the floor and she remained afebrile except for very low grade fever to 100.0 on postoperative day six.
She was admitted on Flagyl that was to be continued through [**2109-7-31**], for Clostridium difficile.
She had recurrence of diarrhea on [**2109-7-31**], that was suspected to be due to a Boost intolerance but given the recurrence of her diarrhea, it was decided to continue Flagyl through [**2109-8-8**].
She was hypercalcemic on admission with a calcium of 11.7.
Her calcium remained elevated with a stable phosphate and magnesium and then her phosphate and magnesium began to drop, with mild response to repletion.
Given her low calcium, she was empirically started on Vitamin D supplementation.
She was given stress dose steroids during her operation given her long term history of steroid treatment.
She was continued on stress dose steroids given her hypotension postoperatively and was quickly tapered off on postoperative day two to her baseline dose of Prednisone 5 mg once daily.
Postoperatively, she complained of some right shoulder tenderness and difficulty moving her right shoulder.
A right upper extremity ultrasound to rule out deep vein thrombosis was negative.
Plain films of the right shoulder were negative for fracture or dislocation although did note diffuse osteopenia.
She is suspected to have a right frozen shoulder or possibly tendinitis which is improving at the time of this summary.
Neurologic - The patient has had right lower extremity sensory and motor deficits since the initial surgery in [**2109-3-27**].
She has no movement of her right lower extremity including her toes and no sensation to her right toes and plantar surface of her foot.
An EMG was obtained on [**2109-7-30**], which was consistent with profound right sciatic neuropathy or less likely a low lumbosacral plexopathy, severe axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy, and a mild to moderate generalized myopathy.
A neurologic consultation was obtained and noted that she had a superficial peroneal and sural nerve numbness with a flaccid foot and ankle.
She suffers from a great deal of neuropathic pain in her right lower extremity and her Neurontin dose was increased to 800 mg three times a day.
Psychiatric - The patient was started on Ritalin and Remeron for symptoms of depression/adjustment disorder during a previous admission.
She was maintained on these medications throughout this hospitalization and while she is clearly frustrated by her situation, she did not show signs of worsening depression.
Rheumatology - Her Sjogren's syndrome has remained stable on Prednisone 5 mg once daily.
Dermatology - The patient has several pressure ulcers that require careful wound care.
She has a large 5.0 by 4.0 centimeter sacral decubitus ulcer that while about one centimeter deep does not appear infected and did not require debridement.
She has stable bilateral heel ulcers that require dry dressings.
She has a new left ankle ulcer that is about one centimeter in diameter and one half centimeter deep that will also require wet to dry dressings.
She developed a suspected intolerance to Boost and should be encouraged to try other calcium and high protein supplements.
Prophylaxis - The patient should be continued on Lovenox, pneumatic boots, a proton pump inhibitor and aggressive wound care.
