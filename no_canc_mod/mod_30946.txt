There is mild pulmonary interstitial edema with cardiomegaly.
No large pleural effusion is seen.
No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with interstitial edema.
There is increased opacity in the upper lungs bilaterally, right greater than left, which given the interval change could reflect aspiration.
No pneumothorax is seen.
Bilateral upper lung consolidation, right greater than left.
This could be defect of increased ventilatory pressure.
No parenchymal opacities have newly appeared.
Currently, there is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
A left-sided cardiac generator pack projects leads into the right atrium and ventricle.
Bilateral upper zone opacities are improved.
There is no effusion, edema, or pneumothorax.
No superimposed edema.
Brief Hospital Course: ======================= BRIEF PATIENT SUMMARY ======================= 64yo F with a history of COPD and sCHF with admitted for several days progressive dyspnea who required intubation on arrival in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ICU stay for COPD flare, then a CCU stay for management of decompensated sCHF; at time of discharge she was breathing comfortably on room air after aggressive diuresis.
======================= ACTIVE ISSUES ======================= # Hypercarbic hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient intubated in the ED, complicated by hypotension.
Differential was COPD versus CHF, or PE (less likely).
Initially cared for in the medical ICU where treated as for COPD, w/goal O2 sats <95% to avoid release of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstricion.
Received combivent q4hrs standing 6-8 puffs with albuterol q2h PRN + Prednisone 40mg PO x4 days for a total steroid course of 5 days (final dose [**3-30**]) & azithromycin 500mg PO for a five day total course (final dose 2/26).
Sputum culture grew only oropharyngeal flora.
# FLASH PULMONARY EDEMA [**3-6**] SINUS TACHYCARDIA Two days after transfer to [**Hospital1 1516**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] became increasingly tachcardic to rates in the 150s.
Following the tachycardic episode, Ms. [**Known lastname **] became increasingly dyspneic with SpO2 in the low 90s on 6L NC.
On exam and CXR there appeared to be florid intrapulmonary volume overload, and the etiology of her decompensation was thought to be secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of tachycardia and poor diastolic cardiac function.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was then transferred to the CCU where she was briefly maintained on pressors for post-anesthesia hypotension (complicated by falsely low non-invasive blood pressures, when arterial access was obtained blood pressures were 20mmHg higher than non-invasive estimates).
# CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE, LVEF 15% On [**2132-3-28**] TTE showed "severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15%)" moderate-to-severe 2+ MR and severe 3+ TR.
Required lasix gtt for aggressive diuresis following episode of flash pulmonary edema (discussed above).
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE Cr elevated to 1.8 max; trended down to 1.2-1.3 w/fluid resuscitation, then up again w/diuresis on lasix gtt.
# DYSLIPIDEMIA on simvastatin 80 mg daily at home, changed to pravastatin 80mg.
FYI to future providers: patient has unreliable upper extremity blood pressure readings secondary to peripheral vascular disease.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Mrs. [**Known lastname **],  You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for difficulty breathing.
You went straight to the ICU and were temporarily on a ventilatory for intensive treatment of a combination of a COPD exacerbation and heart failure/fluid retention.
By the time you returned to the cardiology service on [**3-31**] you were breathing comfortably without supplemental oxygen or intravenous medications.
