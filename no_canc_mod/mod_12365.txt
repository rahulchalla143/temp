Admission Date:  [**2171-4-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2171-4-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2106-1-18**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old woman with a complicated medical history who was admitted to [**Hospital3 15516**] Hospital on [**2171-3-3**] for small-bowel obstruction, status post laparotomy and lysis of adhesions, who postoperatively, was found to have line sepsis with MRSA.
This was percutaneously drained on [**2171-3-26**] and she was found to have vertebral osteomyelitis/diskitis at the level T4-T5, T11-T12, and L2-L3.
Apparently, the patient was going to be discharged to rehabilitation on the day of admission to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**4-3**], when the patient became lethargic and had a temperature to 103.8.
The patient was very lethargic there and ABG showed a blood gas with pH of 7.39, carbon dioxide 39.6, and oxygen 79.
Chest x-ray showed a right left lower lobe infiltrate.
Also, of note, the patient had been given Levaquin and Diflucan at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital for pneumonia and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] in the urine.
Per medical history, osteomyelitis of the vertebral bodies of L2 and L3, growing MRSA in blood cultures, diskitis at three sites including T4 to T5, T11 to T12, and L2 to L3; psoas abscess status post percutaneous drainage; polymyalgia rheumatica on steroids chronically; hypertension; rectovaginal fistula; parotid tumor status post right parotid gland resection; bladder spasms and incontinence; macular degeneration; depression/panic disorder, status post sigmoid colectomy for diverticulitis; status post herniorrhaphy; status post hysterectomy.
HEENT:  Oral thrush present, dry mucous membranes.
Pupils 0.5-mm, hard to assess if reactive, constricted.
NECK:  No lymphadenopathy.
CHEST:  Decreased breath sounds at the right base with egophony at the right base.
No wheezes, no rales, [**Last Name (un) **] catheter site at the right chest, no erythema, nontender.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema.
There was no sacral decubitus ulcer present.
Urinalysis:  Positive nitrites, 3+ blood, no leukocyte esterase, 2 to 5 red blood cells, 5 to 10 white blood cells, no bacteria.
Culture data:  The patient had multiple negative blood cultures dating from [**4-4**] through [**4-20**], which showed no growth, regular cultures and microcytic cultures.
Stool cultures were negative for C. difficile times four.
Tissue culture from the L2-L3 disk on [**4-15**], showed no growth.
Radiology:  Multiple chest x-rays done between [**4-4**] and [**4-20**], initially showed a right lower lobe atelectasis and left lower lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia, which improved over time and chronic mild CHF.
CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on [**4-4**], showed no retroperitoneal bleed and atelectasis of bilateral lungs.
Repeat abdominal CT on [**4-22**] showed no evidence of intraabdominal abscess, thickened wall of the sigmoid consistent with circular muscle hypertrophy.
No CT evidence for diverticulitis.
MRI of the spine on [**4-8**], showed diskitis and osteomyelitis of T4-T5 and T11-T12 and L2-L3.
On [**4-8**], MR of the head showed old ischemic disease in the brain stem with a tiny lesion present advanced periventricular microvascular ischemic changes, left-sided mastoiditis of uncertain age and generalized atrophy.
Echocardiogram on [**4-10**], transesophageal echocardiogram showed no thrombus; no atrial septal defect; mild LVH with LV function ejection fraction greater than 55%, normal RV with mild aortic regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation and significant pulmonary regurgitation.
Perforation was seen at the base of the posterior mitral leaflet consistent with endocarditis of the mitral and aortic valves.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  (by system)  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient initially came in on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Ceftriaxone, Aztreonam, Rifampin, and Fluconazole for treatment of her psoas abscess and vertebral osteomyelitis.
She then developed a severe rash on [**4-9**], approximately six days after admission.
It was not clear to which drug this rash developed, but it was thought most likely due to Ceftriaxone or Lasix.
Transesophageal echocardiogram done [**4-10**] showed a probable mitral valve perforation consistent with endocarditis, no vegetations seen.
The patient continued with fevers and the rash gradually developed bullae and also started to exfoliate.
Urine culture subcutaneously grew Pseudomonas and the patient was started on Tobramycin on [**4-20**] for a seven-day course.
Stool was sent for C. difficile as the patient briefly developed some diarrhea.
The patient developed some irritation of the bladder and Foley site on [**2171-4-24**].
Urinalysis was consistent with a UTI with nitrite, leukocyte esterase, and white blood cells with many bacteria.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient does not have a significant cardiac history aside from hypertension on admission.
However, she developed refractory atrial fibrillation on [**4-9**].
She was transferred to the ICU for atrial fibrillation and hypotension.
She had no further episodes of atrial fibrillation.
Transthoracic echocardiogram was done [**4-9**] and Transesophageal echocardiogram was done on [**4-10**], which showed probable endocarditis involving the mitral valve.
CT surgery was consulted, who did not recommend surgery at this time because the patient had no evidence of ventricular failure and recommended ongoing medical therapy.
The patient was initially treated with Fexofenadine, which was discontinued on [**4-18**], Synalar and hydrated petroleum and Aveeno baths, the rash gradually improved and by the time of discharge it was almost completely resolved except for some light flaking of the skin mostly of the lower extremities.
PULMONARY:  The patient had failure in the setting of atrial fibrillation in early [**Month (only) 116**].
She had no further pulmonary issues and she had good oxygen saturations on room air.
RHEUMATOLOGY:  The patient has polymyalgia rheumatica and is chronically on steroids.
She had two CT scans, which showed that she did not have any retroperitoneal bleed.
Anemia labs were sent, which were normal.
It is most likely that she had suppression due to her infection, which will recover as the patient clinically improves.
NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient was slightly confused and lethargic on admission.
She did not have any evidence for meningitis by lumbar puncture and intracranial abscess or hemorrhage was ruled out by head MRI.
This wound filled well with no complications.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had a small bowel obstruction at the outside hospital and had a laparotomy and lysis of adhesions there.
She continued with abdominal pain during her hospital stay here and she was treated with Tramadol and Neurontin.
She had slightly worsened abdominal pain [**4-20**] to [**4-22**], but repeat abdominal CT on [**4-22**] showed no intra-abdominal pathology.
She did have some constipation, which was relieved with a bowel regimen.
PAIN CONTROL:  The patient's pain was controlled with Tramadol, Neurontin, and for a while she received some morphine, however, this seemed to exacerbate her altered mental status.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Endocarditis with MRSA and Enterococcus.
