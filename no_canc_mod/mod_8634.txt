Significant history to this MVC includes a loss of consciousness, approximately 15 minute extrication, and pain in all extremities upon arrival to the Emergency Room.
Diabetes mellitus.
Mild tenderness on palpation of the right shoulder, although tolerates range of motion of the shoulder.
No tenderness to palpation of either elbow.
No deformity of the hips or the knees.
RADIOLOGICAL DATA ON ADMISSION:  Trauma x-rays from [**2127-2-28**] show a limited AP view of the chest with apparent widening of the mediastinum that likely reflects patient motion and respiratory effort.
A CT of the head from [**2127-2-28**] without contrast shows no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect, a small area of hyperdensity seen within the left cerebellar hemisphere on a single slice.
A CT of the C-spine without contrast on [**2127-2-28**] shows no evidence of fracture or subluxation, multiple enlarged lymph nodes within the neck ranging in size from 1.8 x 1.4 cm.
A CT of the torso, chest, abdomen and pelvis on [**2127-2-28**] shows fractures of the left superior-inferior pubic rami which are comminuted, the transverse processes of L1-L3 on the right and the left, sixth to eighth ribs laterally, mediastinal lymphadenopathy that is not specific in etiology and could reflect lymphoma, or other infectious, or inflammatory conditions, cholelithiasis.
No other acute traumatic abnormality identified.
Plain film x-rays of the bilateral ankles on [**2127-2-28**] show transverse fractures of the third and fourth proximal left metatarsal bones, oblique fracture of the distal left fibula and the proximal left fibula, comminuted fracture of the distal right fibula, as well as well comminuted fracture of the medial malleolus on the right and the lateral aspect of the distal right tibia with medial displacement of the tibia relative to the right talus.
On [**2127-2-28**], AP wrists and hands, plain film x-rays on the left, show multiple fractures of both hands and wrists as described above.
These are described as fracture of the ulnar styloid, as well as the radial styloid, extension of the fracture of the distal right radius into the articular surface.
There are comminuted fractures of the base of the third, fourth and fifth metacarpal bones--those were all on the right.
On the left, there are fractures on the left ulnar styloid, the base of the proximal fourth phalanx, the distal third metacarpal bone, as well as a fracture of the distal left radius extending into the articular surface.
Plain film x-rays from [**2127-2-28**] of the lumbar and thoracic spine show no evidence of fracture or subluxation.
Ankle x-rays, again bilaterally, this time from [**2127-3-1**], show multiple fractures with some disruption of the right ankle mortise.
Proximal left tibia and fibula are shown with no evidence of fracture seen.
Plain film x-rays of the bilateral foot on [**2127-11-30**] show no fracture seen on this x-ray.
Plain film x-rays from [**2127-3-1**] of the right shoulder show no fracture or dislocation.
CT on [**2127-3-2**] of the upper extremities without contrast shows the right hand and wrist have comminuted and slightly displaced fractures of the third and fifth metacarpal bones.
There is a slight displaced fracture of the ulnar styloid.
There is a comminuted fracture with intra-articular extension involving the radial styloid with a small dorsal lip fragment.
No gross disruption of the articular surface of the radius is present.
No other fractures or dislocations identified on the right upper extremity.
On the left hand and wrist, there are comminuted and slightly displaced fractures of the third metacarpal head and fourth proximal phalangeal base.
A small focal calcification adjacent to the second metacarpal base could represent a fragment from a poorly imaged second metacarpal base fracture.
There are no gross disruptions of the articular surface of the radius.
Urine culture from [**2127-3-11**] shows no growth.
Cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine films were obtained to clear the patient of any further fractures at these locations.
The patient was preopped to go to surgery on [**2127-3-7**] for the bilateral ankle fractures, as it was felt that the patient was not as edematous as necessary to postpone any surgical intervention.
[**Last Name (un) **] followed with the primary team to aid in blood glucose control, and changes were made as necessary.
Any electrolyte abnormalities were repleted as found necessary.
The patient was transfused blood for acute blood loss perisurgery.
On [**2127-3-11**], surgical intervention including closed reduction and percutaneous pinning of a left finger fracture and ORIF of a right ulnar styloid were performed in the operating room.
The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well without complication.
Diabetes mellitus.
FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  Follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] with plastic surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of orthopedic surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with orthopedic surgery, and the Trauma Clinic all within 2 weeks of discharge.
