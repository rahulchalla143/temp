Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2128-10-2**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Elevated right hemidiaphragm with right basal atelectasis and/or aspiration.
[**2128-10-2**] CT Head: IMPRESSION: No evidence of an acute intracranial process.
Abnormal enlargement of biparietal sulci for the patient's age.
No acute intracranial abnormality; specifically, there is no evidence of an acute ischemic event.
No anatomic substrate for seizure is identified; specifically, there is no evidence of focal cortical dysplasia or other malformation of cortical development corresponding to the symmetrically prominent sulci at the parietovertex.
No finding to specifically suggest elevated intracranial pressure.
Chronic inflammatory changes involving the paranasal sinuses; correlate clinically  [**2128-10-3**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The continuous EEG was abnormal because of the frequent occurrence of bursts of generalized slowing.
Vascular disease and even some metabolic disturbances, could be the cause, but the recording cannot specify the cause.
Nevertheless, there were no areas of prominent focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform features.
Brief Hospital Course: 45M history of glycogen storage disease and DM presenting with "seizures."
Seizures likely related to hypoglycemia given patients story of taking insulin without eating dinner.
He had no seizures after admission, he has never had a seizure in the past.
There was no history or physical exam to suggest trauma, viral prodrome, or toxin ingestion.
Basic laboratory tests, including lumbar puncture, were not revealing for local infection to the C&S.
MRI and CT head showed no intracranial process.
Bedside EEG was performed, showing no epileptiform activity.
Prophylaxis against further bouts of hypoglycemia, the patient was started on D5 half-normal saline, with frequent blood sugar checks, and a gentle insulin sliding scale regimen.
Patient had no further seizure activity and he was consistently hyperglycemic which was managed as below.
His BS were consistently high without episodes of hypoglycemia.
[**Last Name (un) **] diabetes was consulted, recommended increasing nightime Lantus dose to 9 units and insulin sliding scale was modified which patient was discharged on.
Elevated troponins: The patient had elevated troponins, and CK, and normal CK-MB.
No evolution or dynamic ST segment changes were noted on electrocardiogram.
Cardiology was consulted, and bedside echocardiography was performed, showing no wall motion abnormalities.
In discussion with them, we agreed that the troponins were likely elevated at baseline, due to his underlying long-standing myopathy, and possibly acutely exacerbated in the setting of seizures.
After extubation, the patient was queried and never endorsed chest pain or shortness of breath.
.#Anemia: Stable around 28, this appears chronic and may be related to his poor PO intake and long standing chronic genetic medical condition.
.#.Glycogen storage disease - elevated troponin likely baseline, CK at 3000, above [**2124**] baseline of [**2117**].
Elevated liver enzymes likely from muscle.
#.Leukocytosis - infection v stress.
Likely stress reaction.
The patient had an initial leukocytosis, but the values were trended, showing decreasing trend.
Further infectious workup was unrevealing, and was felt that the leukocytosis was secondary to a stress response.
Transitional Issues: - His outpatient diabetes management needs to be carefully monitored and he should be watched for episodes of hypoglycemia - He does not require outpatient Keppra - ****Patient CANNOT drive for 6 months and he was instructed of this.
Lantus 4units QHS and short acting pre-dinner   Discharge Medications: 1.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Active: - Hypoglycemic Seizure - Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus  Chronic: - Type III Glycogen Storage Disease (Cori-Forbes) - Myopathy related to GSD   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You did not have any additional seizures while in the hospital and Neurology did a work up which was negative for any nervous system causes for your seizure.
You are being discharged in stable condition, without any seizure activity and with good control of your blood sugar.
This is because of the risk of having a seizure while driving puts you and other drivers in danger.
While it is likely your seizure was related to hypoglycemia and work up by neurology was negative, we cannot rule out some other underlying cause of your seizure.
- It is important you follow up with your Primary Care doctor and your [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes doctor.
