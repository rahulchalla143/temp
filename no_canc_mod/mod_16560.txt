Admission Date:  [**2185-6-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2185-6-10**]   Service:  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Symptomatic bradycardia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, atrial fibrillation and flutter who was recently discharged from the [**Hospital6 **] in [**Location 1268**] after undergoing a left femoropopliteal bypass surgery on [**2185-5-16**].
for atrial fibrillation.
On [**2185-6-2**], the patient was found by his roommate to be confused, and there was a question of a fall.
The patient was admitted to the coronary care unit for close observation secondary to intubation.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post left femoropopliteal bypass bypass surgery on [**2185-5-16**].
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2175**], coronary artery bypass grafting surgery in [**2184-8-5**].
Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter.
Lower back pain status post lumbar surgery.
Fibrotic granuloma of the left vocal cord.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Chronic anemia.
Transitional cell carcinoma.
Cardiovascular:  Bradycardic, 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex.
Extremities:  2+ lower extremity edema bilaterally, staples in the right arm and left groin, sutures in the left foot, status post multiple toe amputations, cool extremities, nonpalpable lower extremity pulses, otherwise wounds are clean, dry and intact.
In the Emergency Department here junctional fascicular escape at 36 beats per minute, retrograde PEs, ST depressions in V3 through V5, right bundle branch block pattern.
STUDIES:  Chest x-ray at the outside hospital showed cardiomegaly, bilateral fluffy infiltrates with increased vascular markings.
Transthoracic echocardiogram from [**2185-5-20**] showed an ejection fraction of 45-50%, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, global hypokinesis, no focal wall motion abnormalities, [**2-7**]+ mitral regurgitation, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is an 81-year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass grafting, peripheral vascular disease, atrial fibrillation and flutter, who was sent from rehabilitation with mental status changes, and symptomatic bradycardia with heart rates in the 20s and hypotension.
Here an arterial line was placed, pressors were weaned off, pacing was stopped, patient was able to maintain blood pressures at 140/50 even though he still had an intrinsic junctional escape rhythm in the 30s.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient ended up ruling in for myocardial infarction, even though his peak CPK was 109, MB of 16, MB index of 14.7, and troponin I of 4.1.
We believe that this all can be accounted for by the transcutaneous pacing that he received rather than an actual new myocardial infarction.
There was no obvious ischemia or myocardial infarction in any particular distribution on EKG.
Given the fact that the patient has a history of rhabdomyolysis in response to statins, he was not placed on a statin.
Rhythm:  As already noted, the patient presented with a junctional fascicular block.
Of note, the patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and flutter.
The patient was placed on heparin while hospitalized for atrial fibrillation.
However, it was decided that the patient was too much of a fall risk, especially given his presentation, and heparin was stopped and it was decided that it was too risky to continue any anticoagulation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Pump:  The patient has no known history of congestive heart failure, but does have prior coronary disease.
The patient had an episode of hypoxia on [**2185-6-5**], and was noted to be volume overloaded on chest x-ray.
There was left atrial mild dilatation, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Regional wall motion abnormalities included mid and apical, anterior, septal and lateral hypokinesis.
There was also noted to be 3+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
He was initially placed on hydralazine and Isordil for question of renal insufficiency.
Initially the patient was thought to have sustained an anoxic brain injury.
There were noted to be chronic microvascular infarcts.
However, there was no evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, or blurring of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter.
Once the patient was extubated, he was back to his baseline neurological status, which appears to be mild dementia, easily confused at times but also easily redirected and reoriented.
He was noted to have some difficulty with speech.
There were no focal neurologic signs.
The patient had difficulty with attention, and was quite agitated, trying to get out of bed.
Given the fact that the patient had been on heparin for atrial fibrillation, there was some concern for a bleed.
This showed no evidence of hemorrhage.
There was prominence of ventricles and sulci consistent with atrophy.
The patient's fever curve resolved and he did not have a white count.
Urology:  The patient was noted to have a bag draining yellow fluid close to his right femoral artery.
There was a question of a femoral stick penetrating the bladder causing a fistula.
This is more consistent with lymph rather than urine.
There is no clear source for this serous drainage.
The patient will need to follow up with his primary care physician and cardiologist in addition to his vascular surgeon.
Symptomatic bradycardia secondary to amiodarone.
Mild congestive heart failure.
History of atrial fibrillation/flutter.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass grafting.
Peripheral vascular disease, status post left femoropopliteal bypass surgery.
Pneumonia with positive blood cultures.
