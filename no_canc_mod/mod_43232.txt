Admission Date:  [**2185-7-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2185-8-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2116-6-26**]       Sex:  M   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 103266**] is a 69-year-old male with a history of CAD, hypertension and diverticulosis as well as diverticulitis who was brought to the Emergency Room by ambulance for diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
He was found history of chest pain, shortness of breath or abdominal pain.
He does admit to mild headache.
The patient was complaining of headache and of neck pain.
He, however, denied chest pain, abdominal pain, pelvic pain as well as any nausea.
Ejection fraction was normal per patient's PCP with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] history of hypertension, spinal fusion in the past, no history of diabetes, history of a chronic muscle wasting disease, extensive work-up negative, history of depression, history of diverticulosis and history of diverticulitis, most recent recurrence [**2185-1-27**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Sclera anicteric.
Cardiovascular, regular rhythm, tachycardic with distant heart sounds.
Abdomen obese, soft, nontender, non distended, normoactive bowel sounds, no surgical scars.
EKG tachycardic, likely sinus tachycardia at 133, normal axis, right bundle branch block.
Chest x-ray with bibasilar infiltrate vs atelectasis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient initially presented therefore a 69-year-old gentleman with past medical history of CAD and diverticulitis with septic shock without a clear source on the background of past medical history previously mentioned.
His respiratory status worsened and he was intubated on [**2185-7-21**] and abdominal CT was obtained that revealed an SBO, right middle lobe, right lower lobe and left lower lobe consolidation.
He required approximately 16 liters of fluid resuscitation.
He had an exploratory laparotomy on [**2185-7-22**] after serial CT showed evidence of an SBO.
Perioperatively the patient had a troponin leak with a CK bump thought to be related to demand ischemia in the setting of overwhelming sepsis and causing him to have an MI.
Postoperatively he was afebrile for a few days and then he spiked a temperature again.
His lines were changed and coag negative staph grew from his right IJ line on [**2185-7-26**].
However, they returned a couple of days later and A line was pulled on [**2185-7-31**] and sent for culture as a potential source of his persistent fevers.
The patient's mental status continued to improve starting on [**2185-7-29**] and when his mental status had started to clear he was complaining of back pain which is a chronic problem for him.
On [**2185-8-1**] he was transferred to the medicine floor and he was communicating with much improved mental status and in retrospect, at the time of transfer to the floor, it was felt that his initial septic shock was due to severe likely aspiration pneumonia in the right middle, right lower and left lower lobes and his subsequent fevers postoperatively were likely due to line sepsis.
An abdominal CT showed moderate right and small left pleural effusions with collapse of the left lower lobe.
The patient had completed a 10 day course of Levo and Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia on admission.
His pleural effusions were found to be too small to tap per ultrasound and interventional radiology.
This was treating an A line tip which grew out gram positive bacteria.
There were mixed morphologies that were not speciated, however, since the patient demonstrated persistent fevers (despite antibiotics) with this line in place which resolved promptly after its removal, there was reasonable suspicion to suggest a true line infection.
Echocardiogram done on [**2185-7-29**] was negative for any evidence of endocarditis.
Sputum gram stain [**7-31**] grew out gram positive cocci in pairs and [**7-31**] A line tip grew out gram positive bacteria, not speciated.
Neuro/Psychiatric:  The patient's mental status continued to improve and he was awake, alert and conversational, able to provide a history and an explanation for the reason he came to the hospital initially.
The patient had been on Haldol for agitation but that was discontinued when he was transferred to the floor.
He had a head CT that was negative for any acute process.
An MR of his spine was negative for any epidural abscess.
As mentioned, his echocardiogram was negative except for mild LVH.
His troponin leak represented likely demand ischemia leading to an MI in the setting of severe sepsis and a known reversible ischemic lesion from outpatient ETT performed prior to his admission.
This will be arranged via his primary care physician and will be done to follow-up this MI that he had based on elevated troponin in the perioperative setting.
GI:  Patient with a history of diverticulosis and diverticulitis, has been on Protonix while in the hospital.
He developed diarrhea approximately on [**7-31**].
At this time there is a question of whether the diarrhea is due to Vancomycin or C. diff.
The patient had a swallowing study evaluation due to concern over future aspiration risk.
Pain:  The patient continued to complain of back pain and neck pain which is a chronic problem for him.
Septic shock.
Aspiration pneumonia.
Coronary artery disease, status post PTCA times three.
Chronic muscle wasting disease of unknown etiology.
Status post compound fracture of his left wrist and skull fracture as a child due to an accident.
