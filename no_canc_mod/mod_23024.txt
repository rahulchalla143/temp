Low lung volumes.
Patchy right perihilar opacity, non-specific, but contusion not excluded.
No displaced fracture seen.
No evidence of acute fracture.
Degenerative changes in the cervical spine with posterior osteophytes impinging on thecal sac anteriorly at level C5-C6.
Bilateral subtle foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Focal hyperdensity in the right frontotemporal region concerning for contusion.
Foci of hyperdense material in the left frontal extra-axial space, concerning for small left subdural hematoma.
Blood layering along the left tentorium concerning for left subdural hemorrhage.
Extensive soft tissue contusion along bilateral convexities with hyperdense material in keeping with hematoma.
No shift of midline structures.
No fracture  [**2134-5-30**]: cat scan of abdomen and pelvis:  IMPRESSION:  1.
Hypodensity in the lower spleen (tip); could be hypoperfusion, or small laceration.
Stranding posterior to the kidneys, retrocaval and periaortic concerning for focal ill-defined hematoma; however, no evidence of acute extravasation.
Stranding inferior to the left adrenal gland, concerning for focal ill-defined hematoma, could be left adrenal injury; however, no evidence of acute extravasation.
Bilateral opacities at the lung bases with small effusion could be due to aspiration.
L2-L5 bilateral transverse process fracture.
Left posterior eleventh and twelfth rib fractures.
Stranding in the subcutaneous tissue in the posterior flank area concerning for subcutaneous hematoma; however, no evidence of active extravasation.
Bilateral small renal hypodensities, too small to characterize.
[**2134-6-4**]: cat scan of the head:  IMPRESSION: Unchanged bilateral convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage with nodular components.
Subdural blood along the left tentorial leaflet is less apparent  [**2134-6-4**]:  ECHO:   Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis  [**2134-6-4**]: x-ray of the right hand:  FINDINGS: There are no signs for acute fractures or dislocations.
Hypoattenuating fluid in the bifrontal subdural regions have appeared without any prior imaging history of acute subdural hematomas.
Given their continuous low attenuation appearance since inception, these could represent acute subdural hygromas.
Unchanged subarachnoid hemorrhage in the bifrontal and parietal regions.
Low inferolateral lead T wave amplitude is non-specific.
No previous tracing available for comparison  [**2134-6-10**]: cat scan of abdomen and pelvis:   IMPRESSION:  1.
New extensive fluid collection overlying the paraspinal musculature and right flank is likely an evolving hematoma.
Unchanged bilateral rib fractures and transverse process fractures, as described above.
Bilateral small renal hypodensities are likely cysts.
Trace left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis, decreased compared to the prior study.
Previously seen small right pleural effusion has resolved.
[**2134-6-10**]:  US of liver and gallbladder:   IMPRESSION: Large gallstone without evidence of cholecystitis.
No biliary obstruction.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease, including more significant hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis, cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination.
She was emergently intubated for unfavorable change in mental status.
She was found to have bilateral small SAH, L frontal/tentorium SDH, L post 11th/12th rib fractures, L2-L5 bilateral transverse process fractures and a right posterior lung contusion.
L axillary Aline placed, R MAC line placed.
MRI C-L spine showed no evidence of cord injury/compression/hematoma.
She began to display evidence of lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
Sodium continued [**Last Name (LF) 28645**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] switched to D5W at 100/hr and gave 5 of intranasal DDAVP.
On CPAP 5/5, RSBI < 100, passed spontaneous breathing trial.
[**6-2**]: Repeat CT head showed regression of SAH, stable SDH but some loss of grey-white matter differentiation.
[**6-3**]: Sodium remained unstable, increased repletion rate.
Renal consult recommended starting HCTZ for persistent hyperNa.
[**6-7**]: Her mental status continues to improve and her C-spine was cleared clinically so the collar was removed.
She was reported to have an elevated sodium and polydyspia.
Renal was consulted and the concern for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus related to lithium toxicity was addressed.
Because of her polytrauma, she did have extensive abrasions of her upper and lower extremities which were assessed by the wound nurse.
During this time, she reported increased abdominal pain and a slowly [**Month/Year (2) 28645**] white blood cell count.
She underwent a cat scan of her abomen which showed a new fluid collection.
The gram stain showed no growth.
During her hospitalization, she was evaluted by the Psychiatry service because of her history of bipolar disease.
She was also reported to have difficulty urinating and required episodic bladder catherization.
