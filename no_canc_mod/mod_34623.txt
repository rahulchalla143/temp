There is mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle on both the AP and lateral views, consistent with small left pleural effusion.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged.
Atrial fibrillation.
Left ventricular function.

Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views.
Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal views.
Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography).
Due to suboptimal technical quality (no apical or subcostal windows), a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Transmitral Doppler could not be assess due to absence of apical windows, but there appears to be atrial mechanical function on M-mode of the mitral leaflets.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Trace aortic regurgitation.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
She had bilateral subcutaneous pain pumps.
She had intermittent rapid atrial fibrillation and was restarted on amiodarone and coumadin.
Echo on [**3-19**] showed no pericardial effusion and she was ready for discharge home.
