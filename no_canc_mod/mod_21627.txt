She was found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation.
Further workup at [**Hospital1 **] included a TEE which revealed severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**] TR.
Cardiac catheterization was also notable for single vessel coronary artery disease with a 70% stenosis in the LAD.
Past Medical History: Mitral regurgitation, Coronary artery disease, Atrial fibrillation, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, Temporal Arteritis, Peptic Ulcer Disease with history of GI bleed, ARthritis, Glaucoma, Cataract Surgery  Social History: Widowed, three children.

Amiodarone was added to help control atrial fibrillation.
There was mild LA enlargement.
There was no ECG or 2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved workload.
There was mild mitral regurgitation at rest with at least one grade increase in mitral regurgitation severity with exercise.
Workup was also notable for an urinary tract infection(E. coli) for which antibiotics were started.
On [**10-3**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed a mitral valve replacement utilizing a 25 millimeter [**Company 1543**] Mosaic Porcine Valve; single vessel coronary artery bypass grafting with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending; Maze procedure using RF ablation; and stapling of left atrial appendage.
She remained mostly in a normal sinus rhythm with first degree AV block but intermittent periods of bradycardia and atrial fibrillation were noted on telemetry.
No further bradycardia was noted.
Over the next several days, she continued to make clinical improvements and progressed well with physical therapy.
