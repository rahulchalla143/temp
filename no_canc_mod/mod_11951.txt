Brief Hospital Course: 59M with type 1 diabetes, ESRD recently started on HD, h/o epidural abscess transferred for neurosurgical evaluation and found to be in DKA.
# Diabetic Ketoacidosis: On [**4-2**] found to have DKA with AG 30 and patient had missed his long acting insulin dose prior to admission.
No source of infection was found to have prompted his DKA.
Additionally, on admission there was no evidence of cardiac ischemia that may have prompted it.
# Diabetes.
Patient states he is type 1 and has been on insulin although was on oral agents before.
Suspect there has been a component of uremia making patient resistant to insulin.
# Elevated Troponins.
He did have an elevated Troponin, CK, and CK-MB but no EKG changes and was asymptomatic.
Could be demand ischemia in setting of DKA and severe stress.
# Leukocytosis.
CXR without evidence of an acute process.
Throughout hospitalization remained pain free and afebrile without any localizing sypmtoms of infection.
# Back pain.
History of epidural abscess in the [**2150**].
Back pain resolved in ED and did not recur during hospitalization.
This was likely secondary to muscle spasm in the setting of his hemodialysis.
# End Stage Renal Disease.
Presumed to be secondary to diabetes and HTN.
He has a Quentin catheter in his right chest and a maturing fistula in his right forearm.
# Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.
His iron studies were checked an most consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
# Altered mental status.
He was successfully extubated and had no further symptoms of confusion.
This may have been related to pain medication or uremia given his ESRF.
