The patient has no known drug allergies.
This is a 42-year-old white male who presented to an outside hospital on [**2118-6-15**] for an elective catheterization for his severe three-vessel coronary artery disease.
He had reportedly been experiencing intermittent substernal chest pain for several years which he attributed to heart burn.
However, two weeks prior to admission he experienced a prolonged episode which lasted for about an hour while he was driving which eventually subsided without any medical intervention.
At that time he underwent an electrocardiogram which showed prior inferior myocardial infarction for which he was then referred for cardiac catheterization.
Cardiac catheterization was performed [**2118-6-15**] which revealed 50 percent left main coronary artery stenosis, 100 percent mid left anterior descending stenosis, 70 percent mid left circumflex artery stenosis and a 99 percent OM stenosis with a 100 percent totally occluded right coronary artery.
The patient had an ejection fraction of 30 percent with global left ventricular hypokinesis and infra-apical akinesis.
The patient was extubated the same day as surgery without complications and the patient was placed on an alcohol drip due to his history of alcohol abuse prior to surgery.
The patient's pain was controlled well without the use of Percocet.
The patient was taken off his intravenous drip of alcohol with no evidence of alcohol withdrawal noted.
