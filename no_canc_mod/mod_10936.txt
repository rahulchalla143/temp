Admission Date:  [**2153-1-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2153-1-27**]  Date of Birth:   [**2087-4-4**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CT SURGERY  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 65-year-old male who had experienced a week's worth of crescendo angina, chest pain and shortness of breath.
His past cardiac history includes two weeks of angina in [**2152-7-7**] that ultimately ended up in cardiac catheterization in [**Month (only) **], leading to diagnosis of a complex left anterior descending lesion.
Subsequent to this, he had a recurrence of his anginal symptoms in [**2152-9-6**], therefore prompting another cardiac catheterization which showed a re-narrowing of the similar left anterior descending lesion and consequently underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, brachytherapy, and cutting balloon.
After completing that, the patient was chest pain-free until approximately one week prior to this admission, when he began with the crescendo anginal symptoms, chest pain and shortness of breath that prompted him to be admitted on [**2153-1-19**], where he underwent cardiac catheterization showing a right dominant circulation system with a 70% left anterior descending lesion with 90% distal disease past the site of the stent.
The left circumflex had 30% disease, and 90% ostial lesion at the first run-off from the circumflex.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Hypertension for seven years, hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.
He had a right radial A-line, a right internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter, two ventricular and two atrial leads, as well as two mediastinal and one left pleural chest tube.
He was kept on oral amiodarone for ventricular ectopy and ventricular tachycardia that had occurred postoperatively.
His chest tubes remained for high outputs on postoperative day number one.
He had no recurrence of his ventricular ectopy or ventricular tachycardia.
He had no drainage or erythema.
His wound was open and dry to air.
He had a regular heart rhythm, with no murmur or rub or gallop rhythm.
Trace edema with palpable pulses distally.
Status post coronary artery bypass graft x 4 for crescendo angina and re-stenosed stent 2.
History of hypertension 3.
History of hypercholesterolemia                                 [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 275**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1539**], M.D.
