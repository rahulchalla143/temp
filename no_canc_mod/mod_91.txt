Pt has noted increasing SOB on exertion over the past week.
Has also noted occasional episodes of diarrhea and rare short bouts of chest pain.
Today walked to his car and was so short of breath he leaned on the [**Doctor Last Name 534**] to attract attention for help.
Of note pt was also admitted [**2190-1-30**] for SOB, c/w CHF exacerbation, responded to lasix.
Pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory distress.

Urine culture [**2191-5-9**]: NO GROWTH.
Blood cultures [**2191-5-9**]: no growth.
EKG [**2191-5-9**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
CXR (portable AP) [**2191-5-10**]: Findings compatible with mild congestive heart failure.

Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
There are persistent low lung volumes.
There is no pneumothorax.
There is mild increase in left lower atelectasis.
TTE [**2191-5-10**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate aortic regurgitation.
At least mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: 82 y/o M history of HTN found with respiratory distress requiring bipap, hypertension, and newly noted to be in new atrial fibrillation.
#Respiratory distress/SOB: The patient's shortness of breath was felt to be due to a combination of heart failure and COPD exacerbation, discussed separately below.
There was also concern for possible pneumonia on initial CXR, but the patient remained afebrile, and follow-up CXR showed no infiltrate.
#Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient presented with shortness of breath.
TTE showed preserved systolic function, and was unchanged from prior study.
#COPD exacerbation: The patient presented with shortness of breath and diffuse wheezing in the setting of a smoking history.
#Atrial fibrillation, with rapid ventricular response: The patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation, which is a new diagnosis for him.
He had rapid ventricular response, treated with metoprolol, with improvement in heart rate.
It is unclear if his marked hypertension was a cause of his shortness of breath (flash pulmonary edema), or a consequence of his respiratory distress.
Metoprolol was increased to metoprolol succinate 300 mg dialy in the setting of Afib with rapid vemtricular response.
There was no evidence of hypoperfusion.
The elevated lactate may have been related to increased work of breathing in the setting of respiratory distress, although the rapidity of the resolution (normalizing in <2 hours) also raises the possibility that the initial lactate was a spurious laboratory value.
#Transitional issue: The patient will complete his prednisone taper and follow up in primary care and pulmonology for further management of his dyspnea.

COPD exacerbation 2.
Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure 3.
Atrial fibrillation, new onset, with rapid ventricular response 4.
Shortness of breath .
Hypertension 2.
Chronic kidney disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were also treated with diuretics for heart failure.
You were found to have an irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
You had some rapid heart rates.
Atrial fibrillation places you at an increased risk for stroke.
We discussed the risks and benefits of blood thinning medications, and you decided that you wanted to defer this decision for now and speak with your primary care doctor.
It is making your lung disease worse.
STOP ibuprofen as this can cause kidney problems in patients with high blood pressure.
