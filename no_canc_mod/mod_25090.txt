Admission Date:  [**2105-2-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2105-3-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2064-4-3**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Penicillins  Attending:[**Male First Name (un) 5282**] Chief Complaint: Acetominophen toxicity  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement [**2105-2-16**]   History of Present Illness: This is a 40 yo female with long h/o depression initially admitted to MICU from OSH for eval for liver transplant for likely acute tylenol toxicity possibly [**3-17**] suicide attempt and now transferred to the [**Doctor Last Name 3271**] [**Doctor Last Name 679**] liver service with improving liver enzymes and mental status.
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital 8641**] hospital on [**2105-2-14**] for worsening depressive symptoms, auditory hallucinations, and altered mental status.
At the OSH, her CT abdomen showed moderate fatty infiltration of the liver, and abdominal US showed s/p cholecystectomy, but no biliary dilation.
Prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient had been intubated due to worsening mental status.
There is no other documentation regarding that event.
She also has acute renal failure, likely ATN from Tylenol, and has been followed by the renal team.
Past Medical History: 1) Depression 2) s/p Appendectomy 3) s/p cholecytstectomy 4) s/p D&C 5) Acute bronchitis -> PNA in [**12/2104**] 6) Chronic R-sided chest pain with ?
Family History: - Father with ETOH cirrhosis - Both [**State **] living  Physical Exam: Vitals - T: 97.4 BP: 127/73 HR: 101 RR: 22 02 sat: 99% on RA GENERAL: Sleeping in bed.
TTP worst over RUQ and epigastric regions, + NABS EXT: 2+ DP pulses bilaterally.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pleural effusion or evidence of central adenopathy.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: The liver is diffusely echogenic.
There are no focal hepatic lesions.
There is no hydronephrosis.
There is no intrahepatic ductal dilation.
The right, middle and left hepatic veins are patent, with appropriate waveforms as well as the superior mesenteric vein and inferior vena cava.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
Right parapelvic renal cyst.
Low R wave voltage in leads V4-V6.
Poor R wave progression.
Mild non-specific ST-T wave changes in II, III, aVF and V4-V6.
These changes are non-specific and non-diagnostic.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Acute hepatotoxicity.
Level at outside hospital was > 6, but patient likely did not present for 1-3 days post-ingestion (patient states she is unable to remember the exact circumstances surrounding overdose, and husband reports that she seemed very tired/ill about 2 days prior to admission).
Acute renal failure.
The patient was noted to become hypokalemic and hypophosphatemic several days into this admission, requiring maximum supplementation of 180 mEq of potassium and [**7-21**] packets of neutra-phos daily.
The potassium wasting was suspected to be secondary to a renal tubular defect (though patient was not acidotic at that time), given levels in the urine > 50 mEq/L when serum values would indicate that < 5 mEq/L would be expected.
The low phosphate may have been partially secondary to wasting in the urine but is also common in hepatic regeneration given increased physiologic demand.
After regaining full consciousness, the patient acknowledged that she has been struggling with depression for some time.
However, there is suspicion that the patient either fabricated these accusations or perhaps hallucinated (she had reported hallucinations at the time of admission to the OSH, and could possibly have depression with psychotic features or other psychiatric disorder), as these were three independent staff members and this is unexpected behavior from staff, who are generally well-trained.
At the patient's request, she was discharged later that same evening with the understanding that she will be referred to an outpatient program or personal psychiatrist.
Medications on Admission: 1) Seroquel 300 mg QHS 2) Xanax 1 mg q8H PRN 3) Valerian root for insomnia (per husband) 4) Melatonin for insomnia (per husband)  Discharge Medications: 1.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Disp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: - Acute hepatotoxicity secondary to acetominophen overdose - Acute tubular necrosis secondary to acetominophen overdose - Renal tubular defect (exact pathophysiology uncertain; no acidosis) resulting in electrolyte wasting presumed secondary to acetominophen overdose - Depression - Hypokalemia - Hypomagnesemia - Hypophosphatemia  SECONDARY: - Anxiety   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] with liver toxicity related to acetominophen (Tylenol) overdose.
You were also noted to have kidney failure upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
You were evaluated by the renal team, who felt that your kidney failure was related to the acetominophen overdose.
You were noted to pass large amounts of electrolytes in your urine, which was felt also to be related to the kidney injury by the acetominophen.
Because of concern that your overdose was intentional, you were followed closely by the psychiatry team during your stay.
They initially recommended transfer to an inpatient psychiatric facility where you would therapy to address issues of underlying depression and mental health problems.
We have made the following changes to your medication regimen: - STOP TAKING Xanax (you will be treated for anxiety according to recommendations from your inpatient pscyhiatry team) - STOP TAKING Seroquel (you will be treated for depression according to recommendations from your inpatient pscyhiatry team) - TAKE AS NEEDED Ambien (zolpidem) for insomnia.
