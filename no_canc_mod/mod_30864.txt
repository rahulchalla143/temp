History of Present Illness: 52 yo M with a history of paraplegia secondary ot HTLV-1 infection, sacral decubiti, COPD, and substance abuse who was admitted [**12-13**] for menal status changes and respiratory distress, intubated with pneumonia, sucessfully extubated, then discharged to his NH on [**12-21**], who re-presents today with a suspected methadone/benzo overdose responding to narcan in the ED.
He is on chronic methadone/oxycodone at his nursing home for pain and was found unresponsive w/ a respiratory rate of 4 and bp of 72/64, satting 88%, EMS was called and gave 4 mg narcan to which he responded well, however he required two additional doses for decreased respirations in the ED.
In the ED he desatted to 89-90% on 2L NC and was placed on NRB, subsequently desatted to 75-80% on NRB, lung exam ronchorous, gas at that time 7.37/48/54 and was intubated of hypoxic respiratory failure.
CXR on admission showed resolving pneumonia, shortly prior to intubation, showing worsened bibasilar infiltrates, possibly c/w aspiration.
Sacral decubitus ulcers w/ chronic pain 3.
Paraplegia secondary to HTLV-1 infection 4.

During hospitalization the following problems were addressed:  1. mental status changes: The patient responded well to narcan and was found to have methadone and benzo's in his utox which suggests a medication overdose.
It is recommended that he follow-up with a pain specialist to develop a more appropriate dosing regimen.
Once his mental status improved to baseline, methadone was titrated up to a dose that ensured adequate pain control and put the patient at less risk for oversedation.
2. hypoxic respiratory failure: this was thought to be due to an aspiration event that occurred in the ED.
The patient became acutely agitated when receiving narcan.
He was treated initially with levofloxacin and clindamycin for a possible aspiration pneumonia.
On day two, vancomycin was added to the regimen to cover for possible MRSA pneumonia given his previous hospitalization history.
CXR showed bilateral consolidation and pulmonary edema.
On day 3 his urine showed psueudomonas so his antibiotic regiment was changed to Vancomycin and Meorpenam.
COPD:  the patient has severe COPD as evidenced by the significant bullous disease seen on CXR.
At this time he was continued on combivent MDI for secondary prphylaxis and treatment.
Right subtrochanteric fracture-he complained of R hip pain during the admission.
His course was complicated by 500cc intraop blood loss, and postoperatively, by acute blood loss anemia and hypotension.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was done to rule out a retroperitoneal bleed.
These were felt to not be large enough to account for his HCT drop.
He was guaiac negative and the bleeding was likely postoperative bleeding into his thigh.
His pain in his right leg is well controlled on his current regimen of methadone, morphine elixir during dressing changes, RTC tylenol, and neurontin.
CHF-He developed worsening shortness of breath two days after receiving 4 units of blood for his acute blood loss anemia.
A chest xray done at that time revealed bilateral new pleural effusions, worsening opacities and stable large bullae.
He was diuresed successfully with Lasix and his shortness of breath resolved.
He was able to breath at 97% on Room air, although his respiratory efforts are diminished and he still therefore appears to have an oxygen requirement.
The patient would also benefit from a social work addictions consult given his two recent admissions and continued risk for overdose and aspiration.
Pain control: methadone resumed at lower dose.
He would likely benefit from a pain management consult.
UTI:  Urine culture was positive for pseudomonas.
