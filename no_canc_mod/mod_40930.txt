Symptoms started on Sunday night when he awoke with chest pain without any other associated symptoms, pain was localized to the left chest without radiation.
Pain relieved with 1 SL Nitro.
On Monday he took SL Nitro q 4 hours which prevented pain that day, on Tuesday he had to teach a finance class so he took Nitro patch which also prevented pain that day.
At baseline difficulty walking due to spinal stenosis, but no SOB or DOE or PND.
- In Cath Lab had 3 non-continuous stents to proximal, mid, and distal SVG-LAD graft.

EKG [**2184-9-15**]: Sinus with ST Elevation in aVR, depression in II, III, aVF, V4-V6 .
Venous conduit angiography demonstrated total SVG-LAD occlusion proximally.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid vessel SVG-LAD stent thrombosis with a 4.0x28mm Promus Element RX stent which was postdilated distal and mi to 4.0mm and proximally to 4.5mm.
Total proximal occlusion of SVG-LAD graft.
ECHO [**2184-9-16**]: IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with globally preserved left ventricular systolic function (EF>55%) in the presence of hypokineisis of the basal and mid inferior and inferolateral, as well as the mid and distal septal segments.
At least moderate mitral regurgitation.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation.
Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-3-26**], the septal wall motion abnormalities are new and the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased (previously mild to moderate).
Brief Hospital Course: 71 yo male with long h/o CAD, mild stable angina, who presented to clinic with severe chest pain not relieved by SL Nitro and EKG consistent with STEMI with global ischemia.
His chest pain resolved.
He was hemodynamically datble with no evidence of arrythmia and no signs or symptoms of volume overload.
Follow-up echo on [**9-16**] showed normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with globally preserved LV systolic function (EF>55%) in the presence of hypokinesis of the basal and mid inferior and inferolateral, as well as the mid and distal septal segments.
# dCHF with Mild MR: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure, but was euvolemic during his hospital stay.
Follow-up echo on [**9-16**] showed Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with globally preserved left ventricular systolic function in the presence of hypokineisis of the basal and mid inferior and inferolateral, as well as the mid and distal septal segments.
At least moderate mitral regurgitation.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation.
Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
# Vasovagal Episode: The patient had an episode of bradycardia to the 30s-40s accompanied by sweating and dizziness, with SBPs into the 60s.
He has a history of vasovagal episodes in the past, usually with some medical intervention, such as the placement of an IV in his hand or the removal of an arterial sheath.
# Chronic Mild Stable Angina: The patient was asymptomatic during his hospital stay.
However, he may benefit from longer acting nitro or ranexa in the future if angina persists and is unresponsive to Nitro SL.
# History of Afib: The patient was not in atrial fibrillation during this hospital stay.
# Hyperlipidemia: Home Crestor was increased from 20mg daily to 40mg daily.
