IMAGING: CXR [**2132-12-12**]: IMPRESSION: Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle may be due to trace pleural effusion.
Streaky left base retrocardiac opacity most likely relates to atelectasis/scarring and was also seen on the prior study .
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, slightly increased from the prior CT of [**2132-10-8**].
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.

Brief Hospital Course: 80 y/o with hypotension and AMS in the setting of recent C diff infection, who was found to have worsening sepsis with Enterobacter UTI and new-onset seizures.
ACTIVE ISSUES: # Seizures: Pt developed seizures on HD 4.
She has no prior history of seizures and no clear inciting cause was identified.
She was initially treated with Ativan 1mg SL TID for seizure control, with Ativan 1-2mg IV or IM for active seizures.
However, her mental status improved and she was able to take PO so she was converted to Keppra 250mg [**Hospital1 **], still with Ativan PRN for active seizing.
# C diff: Pt was admitted with positive toxin on [**12-9**] with ongoing diarrhea and leukocytosis.
Her WBC elevation was minor given her age, but due to recurrence and acute renal failure we treated her infection as severe cdiff.
After Flagyl was stopped, pt had recurrence of her diarrhea so she was started on PO vancomycin as elimination of her diarrhea is consistent with her goal to focus on comfort.
# UTI: Pt has previous [**Hospital1 18**] admissions [**10-14**] for UTI with Ecoli treated with Cipro.
On this admission, she had no obvious UTI symptoms but + UA, and given her hypotension we chose to treat her for a UTI.
She was given ceftriaxone (PCN allergy but tolerated ceftriaxone in [**2130**]) abx coverage, but then broadened to cefepime coverage given hypotension and concern for sepsis.
# Hypotension: The history of dysphagia and poor PO intake likely led to hypovolemia which contributed to her hypotension.
Her leukocytosis and elevated lactate suggested infectious etiology which was most likely UTI vs cdiff colitis.
During her MICU admission she continued to maintain her blood pressure without any pressors, and had no recurrence of hypotension.
# ARF: Her Cr was elevated to 1.8 on admission from 1.1 baseline, likely partially prerenal from volume depletion, but given FE Na 2.07% this also suggests partially intrinsic etiology.
She requested it as necessary for tremors.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 11851**] Healthcare & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) 620**]  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS Septicemia due to urinary tract infection/clostridium difficile seizures .

You were admitted to the hospital because you were having low blood pressure.
We think this was because you had a bacterial infection in your urine, along with a c. diff infection.
You also developed new onset seizures, for which we started you on an anti-seizure medicine.
Lorazepam 1-2 mg as needed for seizures - can be given intramuscularly or crushed under tongue if seizing 4.

5-10 mg by mouth every 2 hours as needed for dyspnea or pain 7.
Acetaminophen 325-650 mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed for pain 8.
