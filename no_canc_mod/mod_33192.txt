Brief Hospital Course: 35 y/o man h/o Type I DM presents with vomiting, hyperglycemia and decreased UOP.
On admission found to have DKA complicated by acute on chronic renal failure (Cr 6.3, baseline [**2-24**]) and uncontrolled hypertension (SBP >200).
Precipitant for this episode is unclear, as patient reports taking his insulin as prescribed and has not had recent illness.
DKA was treated with insulin and fluids till gap closed, acidosis resolved and sugars were controlled.
ACUTE-ON-CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, LOW UOP: Patient's baseline creatinine is high 2's to low 3's, though was low 4's in early [**Month (only) 547**].
On presentation he had acute on chronic renal failure with a Cr of 6.5.
He likely had a component of pre-renal azotemia but this also represents progression of diabetic nephropathy.
He is a good candidate for renal-pancreas transplant though he may require peritoneal or hemodialysis prior to that time.
HYPERTENSION: Patient had uncontrolled hypertension throughout his stay in the hospital.
ANEMIA: The patient had anemia of chronic disease with slowly downtrending Hct - to 23 on the day of discharge.

Currently he is asymptomatic from this anemia.
He did have iron, b12 and folate studies which were suggestive of anemia of chronic disease.
