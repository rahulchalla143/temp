No intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal component.
Increased nonspecific stranding along the left flank which may relate to edema and/or redistribution of hemorrhagic products.
However, considering the concern for pneumonia, dedicated PA and lateral radiographs may be helpful to more fully evaluate the lungs if clinical suspicion for infection persists.
Limited study secondary to beam hardening artifact.
Large left femoral sheath hematoma extending from the liver tip on the contralateral side, into the pelvis.
Estimated that 50% of hematoma is free flowing.
Largely resolved subcutaneous hematoma when compared to the previous study.
IVC filter without evidence of IVC thrombus.
LOWER EXT US ([**2168-11-10**]): No DVT in either lower extremity.
Stable appearance of large left lateral abdominal wall hematoma and smaller subcutaneous hematomas.
No new sites of hematoma in this non-contrast scan.
Small left pleural effusion.
Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
No intraluminal thrombus is identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of upper extremity DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 62 year-old female with history of congestive heart failure, diabetes [**Name (NI) **], multiple pulmonay emboli on chronic anticoag who was recently bridged on lovenox for colonoscopy and presented with an abdominal hematoma.
1) Hematoma: Patient had been on chronic anticoagulation with warfarin and an IVC filter given history of pulmonary emboli.
She developed a large subcutaneous abdominal hematoma likely secondary to high dosage Lovenox SC injections.
CT showed collection in subcutaneous tissue with increased stranding posteriorly (?
Restarted warfarin on [**11-4**], however, subsequently developed hematocrit drop from 29 to 21 as a result of over-anticoagulation with heparin during warfarin bridging.
She was found to be guaiac negative but abdominal CT showed a new, large rectus sheath hematoma.
She remained stable with pain in the site of the hematoma and had PT and OT coming to see her.
On [**11-14**] pt seemed to have acutely worse pain and an abd CT was obtained which showed no change in the hematoma even though the HCT went from 32.3 to 28.8 but returned to baseline the next morning to 30.8.
Other than increasing ambulation and getting the pt's pain under control with oxycodone SR 30mg Q12h and oxycodone 20mg q4hr as well as 1-2mg IV morphine q3-4hr prn for breakthrough pain.
Pt was started on a lidoderm patch to try to help control pain at site of hematoma.
Pt was also maintained on her gabapentin which was increased to 300, 300, 400mg a day to help with her neuropathic pain from DM.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], vascular surgery, and ophthomalogy all assessed pt and her history and gave opinions about whether pt should restart anticoagulation at any point.
Ophthomalogy remarked that her hemorrhages in her eyes were due to the anticoagulation as well as her DM and that she should still be anticoagulated even if it meant bleeding in her eyes if it kept her from having a fatal PE.
Vascular surgery (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt that her risks of bleeding outweighed her risks of having a PE and that her IVC would help prevent a PE while another bleed might be fatal.
They remarked that if she was restarted on anticoagulation that it should be coumadin and not heparin or lovenox as she seemed to have more bleeding problems from those anticoagulants than coumadin and that no anticoagulation should be started until her hematoma has resolved.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] had suggested restarting coumadin without a heparin bridge and starting and adjusting the dose very gingerly with tight INR monitoring and control as they did not think she had a bleed while on coumadin.
They wanted to better assess the pt's bleeding and anticoagulation that she was on when she had the bleeding and it seemed that the pt bled when supratherapeutic on lovenox and heparin but not coumadin.
2) Cough/Wheezing: Possible secondary to reactive airway disease, due to patient's extensive smoking history.
However, per patient, past spirometry studies showed only restrictive disease secondary to obesity and now obstructive or reversible process.
Her oxygen saturations remained stable during the hospitalization and her chest x-ray was unremarkable for infiltrative process.
She was placed on standing nebulized treatments and this alleviated the symptoms to some extent.
Chest x-rays showed no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
On the medical floor, SaO2, BP, and RR were stable; patient had no chest pain or pressure to indicate pulmonary embolus.
3) Visual changes.
Patient reported decrease in vision on presentation to ED, especially with straining, movement.
One month PTA, she had experienced hemorrhage into left eye per patient report.
Ophtho consultation diagnosed bilateral vitreous hemorrhage and noted that the patient was legally blind, though it was not confirmed that this was due to recent antigoagulation because the patient has significant diabetes.
No intervention was planned, and outpatient follow-up at [**Last Name (un) **] was recommended.
She will have a follow up appointment in [**Last Name (un) **] ophthalmology [**Last Name (un) **] on discharge in 2.5 weeks with possible ultrasound to assess for retinal bleeding at that appointment.
She was also given stool softeners and cough suppressants to decrease strain.
3) Diabetes [**Telephone/Fax (1) **]: Patient was maintained on her home regimen of 42 units glargine at night plus sliding scale insulin coverage.
4) ARF: Elevated creatinine on admission 1.2 (baseline 0.8) likely of pre-renal etiology, secondary to volume loss from hematoma.
On [**11-15**] the pt's creatitine starting to rise slowly and reached as high as 1.2 which was again likely caused by prerenal causes secondary to pt being off IVF and not taking in enough fluids to counteract her being on her diovan and lasix home doses.
5) Complicated urinary tract infection, with urine culture that initially grew Klebsiella, pan-sensitive.
New UA and culture show E. coli UTI, resistant to bactrim and foley was removed and pt was started on ceftriaxone for 10 days and follow up UA was negative for UTI and the culture is pending.
Pt was restarted on her home dose of urecholine for urinary retention on [**11-26**].
7) Depression: continued Celexa .
9) FEN: Diabetic diet.
10) Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots.
Benzonatate 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3 times a day) as needed for cough.
