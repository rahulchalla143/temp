Denies diaphoresis, rest symptoms or chest/jaw pain.
He underwent a stress echo today, with 6mm downward sloping ST depression across anterolateral precordial leads.
Had anterior chest pain during this.
Subsequent cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital6 5016**] revealed a critical 90% left main lestion.
Since catheterization, he has denied chest pain or symptoms.

POST BYPASS No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate mid to distal septal and anteroseptal as well as apical hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %).
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is no pericardial effusion.
Given his critical left main lesion, he remained in the CVICU and was started on intravenous Heparin.
He remained pain free and stable intravenous therapy.
Operative course was notable for cardiogenic shock from myocardial ischemia several minutes after the inductuion of general anesthesia.
For further operative details, please see operative note.
He maintained stable hemodynamics and weaned from inotropic support without difficulty.
