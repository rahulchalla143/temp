Bibasilar airspace opacities are seen, concerning for infectious process.
Findings could also relate to interstitial edema and clinical correlation is advised.
There is a small left pleural effusion.
CXR [**2180-4-30**]: PA and Lateral: Compared to the prior study there is a more focal patchy feature at the right lung base and the retrocardiac region appears denser.
These findings are most consistent with an evolving pneumonia in the anterior segment of the right lower lobe.
There is less distension of the interstitial markings suggesting a slight improvement in fluid status although there are bilateral effusions.
IMPRESSION: Evolving airspace disease at the anterior segment of the right lower lobe which could be pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
Brief Hospital Course: 50 yo male with DM type I, HTN, ESRD presents with n/v, found to be in DKA, s/p ICU admission for insulin drip.
Found to have an anion gap metabolic acidosis and ketonuria on admission.
Uncertain what precipitated this episode of DKA, possibly gastroenteritis or pneumonia.

Hypertension - patient was contined on carvedilol and furosemide.
Hyperkalemia - on presentation his K was 6.4, with peaked T waves in anterolateral leads.
Pneumonia - question of a right lower lobe pneumonia seen on CXR.
Anemia - Likely related to ESRD.
