[**2147-5-2**] CXR PA/lat: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**2147-5-3**] GI bleeding study: Active, but intermittent Gi bleeding with a source in the mid-epigastrium, probably small bowel.
[**2147-5-4**] Small bowel enteroscopy: No evidence of blood or stigmata of recent blood in stomach, duodenum, and visualized jejunum to 110 cm.
No obvious angioectasia.
There is continued evidence of left pleural effusion but no significant interval change, including no evidence for new pneumonia or CHF.
Brief Hospital Course: 89 year-old female with history of duodenal AVMs and prior bleed, admitted with hematochezia.
She continued to have episodes of hematochezia on the floor, and the GI service was consulted.
A bleeding scan was obtained on [**2147-5-3**], which revealed active but intermittent GI bleeding with a source in the mid-epigastrium, probably small bowel, first seen 70 minutes after isotope injection, consistent with a slow bleed.
A push enteroscopy was subsequently obtained on [**5-4**], negative for active bleeding, stigmata of recent bleed or angioectasias in stomach, duodenum and visualized jejunum to 110 cm.
On [**5-6**], she became tachycardic in the setting of recurrent hematochezia, and was transferred to the ICU for further care.
After a discussion with IR and the ICU team, the patient's family expressed their wishes to avoid invasive therapeutic and diagnostic procedures, including arteriography or further endoscopy.
Once again, per the patient and family, she is to be managed conservatively with transfusional support as needed, no further intervention.
It is expected that she may have further episodes of hematochezia.
Hypoxemia: While in the ICU, Ms. [**Known lastname 27462**] developed new respiratory distress and hypoxemia in the setting of tachycardia.
Her presentation was felt most consistent with diastolic dysfunction (documented in recent echo) and probable flash pulmonary edema, and she responded well to IV Lasix diuresis.
CXRs were negative for pneumonia.
She was also restarted on her out-patient dose of Lasix 20 mg daily on [**5-9**], held on [**2147-5-10**] in the setting of concentrated urine and probable mild dehydration.
Of note, during her first night on the floor, telemetry revealed intermittent bradycardia after initiation of Metoprolol, asymptomatic.
In the next 24 hours, she had no further events, and Metoprolol was continued.
Please also monitor her fluid status, and consider resuming Lasix therapy at 20 mg daily.
The exact etiology of her platelet drop remains unclear, possibly medication-induced, ?
Ceftriaxone versus Lansoprazole.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: [**12-26**]  Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - [**Location (un) 550**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Lower gastrointestinal bleed Diastolic dysfunction Thrombocytopenia Urinary tract infection   Discharge Condition: Patient discharged to [**Hospital 100**] rehab in stable condition.
The source of the bleeding was most likely in the small bowel.
