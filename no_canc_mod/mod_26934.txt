This has clear walls and no solid elements.
There is no hydronephrosis.
IMPRESSION: Hydronephrosis left kidney with good preservation of renal parenchyma, normal right kidney with upper pole cyst.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
The proximal LAD occlusion was crossed easily with a Choice PT XS wire and immediate partial reperfusion was restored.
A 3.5x23 mm Cypher stent was deployed across the lesion at 16 ATM and then postdilated with a 4.0x13 mm Powersail balloon at 20 ATM.
A small 1mm diagonal branch was jailed and partially occluded by the stent and could not be rescued.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.
Successful emergency PTCA and stenting was performed of the proximal LAD occlusion with a 3.5x23 mm Cypher stent which was postdilated to 4.0 mm.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no dissection, and TIMI 3 flow.
Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.

Moderately depressed LVEF.
AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic root.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Trivial MR. LV inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Mid and distal anterior and apical akinesis and distal septal hypokinesis are present.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Anterior myocardial infarction with ST-T wave configuration consistent with acute process 4.
Probable left atrial abnormality 4.
Anterior myocardial infarction with ST-T wave configuration acute/recent/in evolution process 5.
CV: Upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**], EKG showed acute st-elevations in the anterior leads, initial troponins were negative.
An echocardiogram showed depressed systolic function with mid and distal anterior and apical akinesis and distal septal hypokinesis.
HEME:  Given risk for thrombus formation secondary to wall akinesis, anticoagulation was continued with an INR goal of 1.6 to 2.0.
Due to a small drop in hematocrit to 30, pt's anticoagulation with held with a subsequent rise to 33 with stabilization by the time of discharge.
On the day of discharge, patient had guiac (+), non-melanotic or grossly bloody stool.
Patient was also advised to have a follow-up hematocrit check at the same time of his INR check on [**1-14**].
PULM: patient's respiratory status was not an active issue during his stay, as he did not require oxygen supplemenation and did not acquire any shortness of breath upon exertion.
A renal ultrasound was performed, see results above, which showed no acute abnormality.
ID: On day #2, patient had a mild temperature elevation with a mild leukocytosis, prompting a pan-culture.
Empirically he was initated on vancomycin and levofloxacin, with discontinuation of levofloxacin after a CXR failed to show any signs of pneumonia or infiltrate.
A u/a was negative for infection.
Patient did not have any overt signs of a stool infection and no signs of cdiff infection.
His leukocytosis stabilized and his temperature did not spike but he did have periods of low grade temps.
The pIV lines were removed secondary to tenderness and possible cause of infection.
Due to low clinical suspicion of an active clinical infection, the vancomycin was discontinued on day of discharge.
Chronic kidney disease 3.
Anemia   Discharge Condition: stable.
chest pain free.
Patient is advised to return to the ED if he acquires chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or pain that is out of the ordinary for him.
***Pt has been started on coumadin treatments for his depressed ejection fraction on his echocardiogram secondary to his myocardial infarction.
*** Also, pt's hematocrit initially had a small drop to 30, but returned to 33 and was stable on two checks prior to discharge.
He was guiac positive on the day of discharge, but did not have any overly bloodly stools or melanotic stools.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] PCP should further [**Name9 (PRE) 8019**] possible sources of GI bleed - if his hematocrit continues to fall by recheck on [**Name (NI) 766**], pt may need to be readmitted for work-up of a GI bleed.
