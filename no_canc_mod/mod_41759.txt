Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.
No LV mass/thrombus.
AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus.
Mildly dilated aortic arch.
No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal arch coarctation.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Trivial MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Contrast study was performed with 3 iv injections of 8 ccs of agitated normal saline, at rest, with cough and post-Valsalva maneuver.
Conclusions  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal inferior wall and hypokineis of the inferolateral and anterolateral walls.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild left ventricular focal systolic dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.
Estimated moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
CK(CPK)-3014*  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 36821**] is a 49-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and heavy smoking who developed intermittent pain in his right foot three days ago.
Since that time, the pain has become increasingly constant and severe.
On further questioning, he relates a history of intermittent claudication of the right lower extremity at 1-2 city blocks which is relieved by rest.
Emergently taken to the the endo suite for angiogram  [**5-9**]  PROCEDURE:  Ultrasound-guided imaging for vascular access, contralateral third-order catheter placement with abdominal aortogram and unilateral extremity runoff, infusion catheter for thrombolysis.
Pt tolerated the procedure well, no complications.
Pt leg was also concerning for compartment syndrome.
He tolerated the procedure well without any difficulty or complication.
