# Hypotonic Hyponatremia: In the setting of poor PO intake and diuretics.
No signs of central pontine myelinosis and no further seizures once Na corrected.
# Seizures: Secondary to hyponatremia.
Seizure in the setting of Na 114, suggests that sz threshold may have been lowered by SSRIs and levaquin.
Once her Na had normalized, SSRIs were re-started.
She had no si/sx of active bleeding and her decrease is most likely [**1-15**] volume resuscitation w/resultant hemodilution.
# Hypotension: SBP 80s-100 in MICU.
Her baseline SBP is ~100s, suggesting a component of volume depletion.
She had no si/sx sepsis.
Diuretics (which she takes for her dependent edema) were held, but pt was instructed to resume taking them on d/c.
# Positive BC: [**12-17**] BCx grew alpha-hemolytic strep >24 hours after being drawn in an asymptomatic patient, suggesting a contaminant.
Pt's central line was without tenderness or erythema.
# R ischial ulcer: Stage II-III with no undermining.
# Anion gap acidosis: On admission pt had an AG attributed to starvation ketoacidosis, which resolved with fluids/PO intake.
# MS: Neuro c/s recommended continuing current regimen of Baclofen.
# Dispo: Pt was d/c'ed home with services once her surveillance cxs were 48hr neg and her Na was consistently in normal range with no further seizures.
