Admission Date:  [**2108-12-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2108-12-27**]  Date of Birth:  [**2031-4-26**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Dilantin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: AMS s/p intubation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: intubation and s/p extubation central line placement   History of Present Illness: Pt is a 77 yo female with h/o hemorrhagic CVA in [**2098**] 2/2 L PICA aneurysm, subdural hematoma, s/p VP shunt for obstructive hydrocephalus, DM 2, schizophrenia, who presents after being unresponsive since yesterday night.
She has had two days of non-productive cough.
Left hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident in [**2098**] secondary to left PICA aneursym, s/p clipping.
Subdural hematoma/epidural hematoma 3.
VP shunt placement for obstructive hydrocephalus.
Removed in [**2101**] for external exposure--cultures grew multiple organisms, consistent with contaminantion.
Shunt replacement in [**Month (only) 1096**] of [**2104**] for recurrent hydrocephalus.
Dementia 3.
Atypical psychosis/Paranoid schizophrenia with a history of tardive dyskinesia.
Depression 8.
Postmenopausal bleeding   Social History: Patient was born in [**Country 21363**] and moved to the US in the [**2061**].
Open mouth with foul odor.
Stable periventricular changes related to small vessel ischemia.
No acute findings.
No evidence of pneumonia.
Mild congestive heart failure.
No source identified for large hematocrit drop.
Multifocal areas of consolidation in both lungs.
Findings appear more than simple atelectasis, and could be due to pneumonia, including atypical sources.
Small bilateral effusions, right greater than left.
CT evidence of bronchomalacia.
This was not a designated tracheal CT for full assessment, but there appears to be severe malacic change involving the right main stem bronchus and to a lesser degree, of the carina.
Allowing this, however, there are remained opacity within the right upper lobe consistent with the upper lobe collapse.
There is right upper lobe volume loss with fluid in the right major fissure and mediastinal shift to the right.
Patchy consolidation in the right upper lobe is again seen.
Bilateral pleural effusions layering posteriorly are again visualized.
There is still significant the right upper lobe atelectasis and fullness in the right lower paratracheal region of the mediastinum and right hilus that should be followed to document clearing.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
No pneumothorax.
[**12-11**]: CXR- IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-7**] through 11: Consolidation and volume loss in the right upper lobe and right infrahilar consolidation has not improved since [**12-9**] and there is now mild edema and a small volume of bilateral pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.
[**12-12**]: CXR- IMPRESSION: Left-sided PICC line within the left internal jugular vein.
No other significant cardiopulmonary changes compared to the film from three hours prior.
There is no change in the partial right upper lobe atelectasis as well as in the right lower lobe/right middle lobe atelectasis.
There is increase in bilateral layering pleural effusions.
Atelectasis persists in the right upper lobe.
There is no appreciable pleural abnormality.
No pneumothorax.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
Allowing for lower lung volumes currently, no overt CHF or obvious pulmonary infiltrates.
[**12-19**]: Head CT w/o contrast- IMPRESSION: Overall unchanged appearance of the brain, without acute intracranial hemorrhage.
No acute fracture or dislocation.
There is no electrophysiologic evidence for a post- synpatic disorder of neuromuscular transmission (as in myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]).
The findings are not consistent with a disease of the motor neurons or with a generalized polyneuropathy.
The CRDs and positive sharp waves in the right first dorsal interosseous are suggestive of a mild, chronic right C8/T1 radiculopathy.
The CRDs in the iliopsoas are of uncertain clinical significance and may represent a high lumbar radiculopathy.
No significant interval change otherwise compared to [**2108-12-19**].

# Respiratory failure- secondary to pneumonia, heart failure, and RUL collapse.
This gradually resolved with persistant fluid in the right minor fissure.
She had a sputum which was + for H flu and had evidence of RML pneumonia.
She underwent treatment with 8 days CTX and has since been afebrile with clearing of her CXR.
She was also found to have pulmonary edema on CXR.
Of note, she was difficulty to wean from respirator and neurology was consulted for concern of potential neurologic weakness.
She underwent head and neck CT for c/o cervical cord injury (unable to get MRI [**2-2**] metal aneurysm clips).
The CT showed no cervical spinal injury.
EMG showed no neuronal, neuromuscular, or myopathic disease.
# Altered mental status- Found to be lethargic at Nursing home.
Likely [**2-2**] PNA, UTI, and bacteremia as above.
She had no discrete neurologic findings on exam.
LP was attempted the evening of admission but was unsuccessful due to technical difficulties.
Neurosurgery was consulted for concern of shunt/CNS infection; they felt her picture was inconsistent with CNS infection and did not tap her VP shunt.
While, she was on the floor, her daughter saw her and felt her mental status was at baseline.SHe is oriented to self, but no to time or place.
On the morning of discharge, patient was drowsy but easily arousable to voice and stimulation.
She was also covered broadly with vancomycin and zosyn for potential pneumonia and possible meningitis.
Admission cultures revealed an E coli UTI, H flu pneumonia, and prevotella bacteremia.
She was treated with an 8-day course of antibiotics with documented clearance of bacteremia, urinary infection, and pneumonia.
# HCT drop: the day after admission Ms. [**Known lastname 97865**] had a near 10-pt hct drop.
Stool was guaiac negative and CT chest, abdomen, pelvis showed no signs of bleeding.
It is likely that she was quite dehydrated on presentation and the very aggressive fluid recuscitation caused her hct drop.
# Diastolic heart failure: As above Ms [**Known lastname 97865**] was found to have pulmonary edema on CXR.
Her CXR normalized and was found to have a contraction alkalosis (and was therefore given acetazolamide) and increasing BUN/Cr.
She was also started on a beta blocker for treatment of hypertension and for prolonged filling time.
# Hypertension Once patient was stabilized and transferred to the floor, she was found to be somewhat hypertensive and was started on a beta blocker for treatment of hypertension and for prolonged filling time and also an ACE inhibitor.
# Hypothyroidism- continued on thyroid replacement .
# Schizophrenia- restarted on zyprexa, ativan and trazodone during this hospitalization .
# Opthalmogic- continue eye drops.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - LTC  Discharge Diagnosis: pneumonia urinary tract infection hypertension diabetes respiratory failure   Discharge Condition: stable.
Patient is tolerating oral intake and has returned to her baseline mental status.
Please call your doctor if you experience fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain as these may suggest a serious condition.
