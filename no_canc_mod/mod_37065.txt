Coronary artery bypass x 4(LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM,SVG-PDA-,SVG-DG) on [**2109-1-16**]   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 47774**] is a 70 year old female who presented to [**Hospital1 2519**] on [**2109-1-7**] with acute shortness of breath after arrival for a podiatry appointment.
In addition she had a rise in her cardiac enzymes.
Given her cardiac history of known 3 vessel disease she was transferred to [**Hospital1 771**] for furthur work-up.
Past Medical History: hypertension obesity s/p carotid endarterectomy Hypercholesterolemia noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus Depression Arthritis Prior cerebellar CVA (residual balance issues) coronary artery disease  Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco  use, but she has a 60 pack year history (stopped 10+ years ago).
As per patient's family patient is very obese and depressed and is not doing much for herself these days.
Family History: Brother with CAD and MI age 50 and Father with MI age 50.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
Neck: cannot assess JVP secondary to body habitus, no obvious bruits over carotids bilaterally, supple CV: RR, normal S1, S2.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: CTAB to anterior auscultation only, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pertinent Results: [**2108-1-12**] - Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the apical septum, inferior wall, anterior wall, and true apex.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressedl (LVEF 45-50 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with mild regional left ventricular dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease.
Elevated LV filling pressure.
Small circumferential pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-5-31**], regional dysfunction appears less extensive with a corresponding increase in left ventricular ejection fraction.
A small pericardial effusion is now present.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 47774**] is a 70 year old female who presented to [**Hospital1 2519**] on [**2109-1-7**] with acute shortness of breath and was transferred here for catherization.
She was found to have a bump in her cardiac enzymes and was treated for myocardial infarction.
She was started on ciprofloxacin for a positive urinalysis.
intubated   Epinephrine and neo synephrine were started for low cardiac index.
Due to increased work of breathing and hypoxia, despite BiPAP.
Diuretics were continued with a fall in BUN and creatinine and improvement in oxygenation.
