The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe regional dysfunction - with severe hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral and basal inferior walls, and near akinesis of the distal half of the septum, distal half of the anterior wall, and distal inferior wall.
The apex is mildly aneurysmal and akinetic.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2146-8-17**], moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now identified.
SERRATIA MARCESCENS.
MODERATE GROWTH.
He was thought to be coagulopathic due to his unmonitored use of plavix, aspirin, and coumadin for his left ventricular wall motion abnormalities.
An EGD revealed gastritis but no acute bleed.
He was found to be negative for h. pylori.
Coronary artery disease: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is status post anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction with stenting x 2 in [**Month (only) 216**] of [**2146**] following a motor vehicle accident.
At times it was accompanied by dyspnea and might last up to 30 minutes.
He also had some paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea in the last few days.
The night before admission he experienced chest pain that woke him from sleep and was accompanied by dyspnea and light headedness.
He denied nausea, emesis, diaphoresis, or dizzyness.
These symptoms resolved within 30 minutes.
Congestive heart failure: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a history of CHF with EF of 20% with RV apical akinesis and an apical left ventricular aneurysm.
In addition to aggressive diuresis to avoid volume overload, he received at least 8 units of blood products for his GIB and to prevent further myocardial ischemia.
Although his ins and outs were negative, Mr. [**Known lastname **] soon developed respiratory failure.
On the evening of admission, he suddenly became dyspneic, tachypneic, and diaphoretic.
He was emergently intubated for flash pulmonary edema and upon introducing the endotracheal tube, large quantities of foamy red secretions emerged.
His pulmonary artery catheter revealed pressures consistent with volume overload and cardiogenic shock (CVP 18, RA 15, RV 58/20, PA 58/27/40, PCWP 24).
The patient's cardiac markers were cycled and were consistent with new ischemia, although a later transthoracic echo was unchanged.
Atrial fibrillation/SVT: One day after placement of the PA catheter, the patient developed hypotension with a narrow complex tachycardia, which did not break with carotid massage.
In the following days, the neosynephrine was weaned, the amiodarone was continued, and the patient remained in sinus rhythm with a brief episode of atrioventricular node reentrent tachycardia.
It was thought that these arrhythmias occured in the setting of cardiogenic shock and the irritating effect of the catheter on the myocardium.
Given these considerations, no AV node ablation or long term amiodarone was indicated.
Respiratory Failure: Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed flash pulmonary edema in the setting of receiving several units of blood and fresh frozen plasma.
He did well until he became febrile and developed the onset of increasing secretions and oxygen desaturations.
His endotracheal secretions grew out serratia and he responded well to piperacillin/ tazobactam.
His failure was though to be secondary to prerenal hypoperfusion due to the GI bleed, the myocardial ischemia, and the CHF.
Both his ACE inhibitor and the lithium were held until his renal failure resolved.
In the interim, he developed hypercalcemia which was though to represent the action of lithium usually blunting the calcium sensing receptors on the parathyroid gland.
He also briefly became hypernatremic, which was thought to be due to increased insensible losses during his febrile state (ventilatory associated pneumonia) vs RTA and resolved with free water boluses and administration of IV D5W.
Bipolar disorder: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a history of bipolar disorder and has been followed at this facility by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5715**].
However, he developed severe depression and was placed back on lithium.
This increase was thought to be secondary to his acute renal failure.
The patient does not look actively infected to explain acute phase reactant effect.
Please monitor closely as patient has history of supratherapeutic INR and GI bleed during recent admission.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: cardiogenic shock atrial fibrillation acute renal failure gastrointestinal bleed, gastritis bipolar disorder congestive heart failure with EF of 15% coronary artery disease s/p MI and stenting ventilator associated pneumonia hypernatremia hypercalcemia transient atrioventricular node reentrent tachycardia   Discharge Condition: Improved.
