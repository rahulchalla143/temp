Per reports, patient had a questionable CVA 3 weeks ago, and at that time, was also reported to have developed bilateral lower extremity weakness.
The weakness has progressed to the point where she can no longer walk or move her legs.
She also reports pain and numbness to her L leg, as well a as "dullness" to her thoracic/abdominal region.
She denies urinary or bowel incontinence, other than her usual stress urinary incontinence, and also denies any saddle anesthesia.
Degenerative disc disease 5.
Hyperlipidemia  Social History: Social Hx: She is Spanish Speaking only.

Was able to feel anterior pinprick, but describes it as dull.
MRI from [**Hospital 8**] Hospital, [**2173-9-29**]: LUMBAR SPINE: L1-L2: There is a focal left paracentral disc protrusion and a broad based right paracentral to extraforaminal disc protrusion, with associated spondylitic ridging.
Facet arthritis is asymmetrically moderate on the right and mild on the left.
There is resultant severe spinal canal stenosis with complete effacement of SCF in the thecal sac, and severe foraminal encroachment which is worse on the right.L2-L3: The disc is severely degenerated with bulging of spondylitic ridging and there is moderate facet arthritis, with resultant moderate to severe canal stenosis, severe encroachment of the left neural foramen and moderate right foraminal encroachment.L3-L4, and L4-L5: There is a shallow broad based dorsal disc protrusion and moderate facet arthrisit causing moderate to canal stenosis which is asymmetrically most prominent along the left lateral recess, moderate foraminal encroachment on the right, and severe froaminal encroachment of the left.
CERVICAL MRI: Motion degraded study showing mild cervical spondylosis.
MRI HEAD: Results are unavailable   Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year-old woman with a past medical history including obesity, DMII, hyperlipidemia, and cervical spondylosis who was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**2173-10-7**] with with lower extremity weakness and was found to have stenosis at L1-2 for which she underwent laminectomy; she subsequently developed progressive weakness in the lower extremities, upper extremities, and face and was discovered to have evidence of AIDP.
# NEURO: When the patient first presented, she was evaluated by both Neurosurgery and Neurology, where she was found to have diffuse weakness, R>L, a R sided facial palsy, decreased pinprick to the mid thighs, saddle anesthesia, brisk reflexes in the upper extremities, but no reflexes in her lower extremities.
It was suspected that her inability to walk was due to her lumbar stenosis, and that her facial and upper extremity weakness were due to a lacunar stroke, that was too small to pick up on MRI.
She had a repeat MRI with DWI to rule out possible infarction to explain her symptoms, which was negative for infarct.
During surgery on [**10-12**], a CSF sample was obtained, which showed an elevated protein of 197, with 1 WBC and 24 RBCs.
On [**10-13**], patient complained of increased pain and was observed to have progressive increase in weakness in her upper extremities as well as a bilateral facial droop, R>L.
She also increased her requirement for O2 due to dyspnea.
She was re-evaluted by Neurology, who found her facial weakness to be worse, with complaints of dysarthria, dysphagia, and mild dyspnea.
As her respiratory status continued to decline, she was transferred to the ICU and intubated.
Sputum culture demonstrated gram positive cocci in clusters for which IV vancomycin was begun ([**2173-10-28**]) and subsequently switched to nafcillin after it was determined to be coagualase positive staph sensitive to nafcillin.
Stool was positive for c. difficile toxin for which flagyl was started ([**2173-10-29**]).
For a concurrent urinary tract infection, ciprofloxacin was initiated ([**2173-10-28**]) and continued for a ten day course.
Initial attempts to place a PEG in conjunction with the trach were thwarted as the patient was found to have "concretions" in the esophagus.
On repeat study, she passed to receive NGT diet of ground consistency and nectar prethickend liquids.
Glycerin (Adult)     Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Gabapentin 300 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for dysesthetic leg pain: Please give via PEG.
Neurologic exam notable for paraparesis with limited movement at proximal legs and none distally; moderate weakness of UEs but at least antigravity.
