female with diabetic neuropathy and chronic lower extremity edema who was evaluated and treated in the ER on [**6-26**] for lower extremity cellulitis.
She denies any fevers or chills.
She denies any pain but reports that her sensation is markedly decreased in her lower extremities due to neuropathy.
She denies any nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, chest pain or shortness of breath.
Colon cancer [**2187**] s/p colectomy, treatment with 5-FU, in remission since.
DM-II x 10 years, has peripheral neuropathy, microalbuminuria.
HTN Hyperlipidemia PVD s/p bilateral fem [**Doctor Last Name **] bypasses Bilateral cataracts Obstructive sleep apnea Urge incontinence  Social History: Patient is retired and formerly worked at [**Location (un) 8599**]Hospital in computers.
She has several close friends that help her with her shopping and getting to appointments.
Physical Exam: Vitals:BP:160/64 HR:86 RR:20 Tc:98.8 O2Sat:98.8 General:A&O x3, NAD HEENT:EOMI, Sclera anicteric, MMM, no rhinorrhea or epistaxis, clear oropharynx.
Neck:Supple, no JVD Chest: Lungs CTAB, no wheezes, rales or rhonchi Cardiovascular: RRR, nl S1 and S2, no M/G/R Abdomen: Soft, NT, ND, +BS, no HSM Extremities: +1 pitting edema bilaterally.
Bilateral lower extremity stasis changes and erythema/warmth overlying anterior legs bilaterally.
Ulcerations present between 1st and 2nd interdigital spaces and on anterior shin.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy.
[Intrinsic right ventricular  systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid  regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace  aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are  mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is  severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Differential diagnosis includes CHF or other interstitial processes.
Bibasilar atelectasis and small effusions.
Respiratory distress/decreased oxygen saturation: Pt noted to have decreased oxygendation saturations on HD #[**1-5**], dropping into the 70s while on RA with improvement to the 90s on oxygen.
On HD #6, pt was sent to the ICU for hypoxia and for initiation of BiPAP with the thought that OSA was contributing to the hypoxia.
During her ICU stay, pt developed worsening hypoxia.
She was initially treated empirically for a PE with a heparin drip but this was stopped after a VQ scan was low probability.
Due to increasing hypoxia and resp distress, she was intubated.
due to CHF, aspiration pneumonia and OSA.
She was diuresed with a lasix drip, treated with cipro and vancomycin for possible aspiration pneumonia and she was successfully extubated on HD#14 after eight days.
# Obstructive Sleep apnea: Pt had been on CPAP 3 years ago but discontinued due to repeatedly having to take the mask off at night due to urinary incontinence and repeated trips to the bathroom.
As above, it was thought that OSA was contributing to her hypoxia but she was not tried on BiPAP while in ICU.
# Hypertension: Pt's BP was difficult to control in the hospital.
She cannot tolerate beta blockers due to bradycardia.
Her hydralazine was discontinued due to poor outpatient choice for BP control and clonidine patch was started.
# Afib: Pt is chronically in afib but has refused anticoagulation.
Her digoxin was stopped as it was thought that is was not needed for rate control and is not indicated for her diastolic heart failure.
# Cellulitis: Cellulitis not resolving with outpatient PO amoxicillin/clavulanate.
Wound Cx positive for and treated for Pseudomonas sensitive to Ciprofloxacin.
Acute on chronic renal failure: On admission, creatinine increased to 1.5 from baseline of 1.3-1.4.
This increased to 2.0 and her lasix was held due to thought of volume depletion.
# DM: Pt with some episodes of asymptomatic hypoglycemia while in house.
Oxybutynin was stopped due to foley and incidence of orthostatic hypotension.
# Diarrhea: cdiff negative.
