Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Slight increase in size of left thalamic intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with slight increase in rightward shift of normally midline structures, new layering blood in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and fourth ventricle, and few small foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There is again blood within the left lateral ventricle, with new intraventricular catheter in place and interval decompression particularly of the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Encephalomalacic change in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] probably due to old insult such as infarct or trauma.
Also right cerebellar atrophy and evidence of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
Essentially unchanged large hemorrhage in the left lateral ventricle and also bilateral occipital horns with a large intraparenchymal left thalamic hemorrhage.
Persistent mass effect as noted.
Stable appearance of left thalamic parenchymal hemorrhage, with large amount of blood in the left ventricle resulting in mild mass effect.
No new focus of hemorrhage.
Stable appearance of left thalamic parenchymal hemorrhage, with slight interval decrease in amount of left ventricular hemorrhage, with no change in mild mass effect.
No new area of hemorrhage.
No change in mild mass effect.
No new area of hemorrhage.
No interval change since the prior exam.
No new areas of bleeding.
Slightly increased size of the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], with associated new air, is likely secondary to manipulation in the setting of tPA administration.
Unchanged left thalamic parenchymal hemorrhage, left parietal parafalcine subdural hemorrhage, and scattered subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Stable size of the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] with stable foci of air, likely secondary to manipulation.
Unchanged left thalamic parenchymal, left parietal parafalcine subdural and scattered subarachnoid hemorrhage.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2146-8-18**]): IMPRESSION: No significant interval change in intraparenchymal, subdural, and subarachnoid hemorrhage as described above.
Persistent unchanged left thalamic and intraventricular hemorrhage.
Tiny foci of new hemorrhage along the ventriculostomy catheter tract.
Unchanged appearance of scattered subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage.
Unchanged left thalamic, intraventricular, and small foci of subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhages.
Small amount of blood along the prior catheter tract is also unchanged.
Slightly decreased size of left thalamic hemorrhage.
Interval improvement of hemorrhage at the ventriculostomy site.
Interval decrease size of the left thalamic hemorrhage, but with persistent peri-hemorrhagic edema and mass effect.
Interval decrease in small intraventricular hemorrhage, dependently located in the occipital horns.
Unchanged posterior ethmoidal air cell opacification.
No definitive CT evidence of pancreatitis.
The pancreas enhances homogeneously with no peripancreatic inflammatory changes.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 year old right handed woman with a past history including HTN, and hyperlipidemia who presented [**2146-8-12**] with a left thalamic hemorrhage with extension into the lateral ventricle.
# NEURO: On admission the patient was noted to have significant hydrocephalus, and was emergently taken to the operating room for EVD placement.
On [**8-14**] she became relatively somnolent, and CT scan showed a significant amount of remaining ventricular blood.
At least daily CT scans were performed from [**2146-8-13**] until [**2146-8-16**], and revealed stable left thalamic, intraventricular, subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhages.
A head CT repeated [**2146-8-23**] showed a decrease in the size of left thalamic hemorrhage in addition to improvement of occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and ventriculostomy site hemorrhage.
# CVS: Due to elevated and labile blood pressures, a nitroprusside drip was initiated and then transitioned to a nicardipine drip on [**8-15**].
# RESP: In the setting of significant confusion, the patient was initially intubated for airway protection.
# ID While the EVD was in place, cefazolin was administered for prophylaxis.
On several occasions in the course of the hospitalization, the patient developed a leukpcytosis in the absence of elevated temperature.
Blood cultures, urinalysis and culture, and chest x-rays failed to show contributory infection.
It is thought that the fevers could have been secondary to intraventricular blood.
By the time of discharge, the patient had been consistently afebrile for over 48 hours.
# ABD/GI In addition to the placement of an NG tube, an oral diet was started with the guidance of the speech and swallow and nutrition teams.
Senna 8.8 mg/5 mL Syrup Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left thalamic intraparenchymal hemorrhage thought to be secondary to hypertension   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: You presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] with right-sided weakness.
Imaging revealed bleeding in the left side of your brain, for which a special drain was transiently placed.
* Please seek medical attention if you develop a change in mental status, difficulty understanding what others are communicating, increasing weakness - especially on one side of your body, shaking of the limbs, temperature over 100.3, shaking chills, or any other symptom you find concerning.
