He was seen at an outside institution with a history of bacterial peritonitis over the month of [**Month (only) 1096**] related to his peritoneal dialysis.
A repeat CT scan performed on [**2-13**] demonstrated evidence of small amount of free air and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further medical evaluation.
Extensive gangrenous changes were noted in the terminal ileum and right colon and then generally ischemic changes out the entire small bowel on the antimesenteric border.
He underwent an enteroenterostomy and closure of the abdominal cavity.
He underwent a CT of the abdomen on the 20th which was looking to evaluate for a source of his increasing white blood cell count.
He was found to have a small amount of free air within the abdomen but patent stent and some thickening in the small bowel and stomach concerning for mesenteric ischemia.
There was no evidence of mesenteric ischemia.
There was some "turbid fluid" within the abdomen and this was suctioned and lavaged.
On the morning of [**2-26**], the patient was found unresponsive with posturing of his upper extremities.
He was sent for an emergent head CT that demonstrated a large parenchymal hemorrhage with mass effect and herniation.
This was not believed consistent with survival.
