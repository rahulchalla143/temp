FS at home have been 300s-400s for 3 days and she has had large ketones on dipstick.
She presented to her OB today with these symptoms and was sent to the ER where she was found to be in DKA with anion gap of 19.
She was seen by endocrine who recommended very tight control of her FS (80-120 for 4-5 hours while still on drip) before transitioning back to her pump given her history of very poor control.
ROS: baseline cough, denies sputum, no dysuria, no other symptoms.
Past Medical History: - pregnant at 7w2d, past TAB x 1 - DM type I x 11 yrs seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Last Name (un) **], on insulin pump with basal 3u/hr., does not carb count, infrequent FS, does not give self boluses; A1C 12.5 as of [**2148-4-16**] - Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] s/p thymoma removal at [**Hospital1 2025**] - [**Doctor Last Name 933**] disease - was on tapazole, changed to PTU on [**2148-4-16**] at first OB visit.
She continued to have high fingersticks, but was no longer in DKA and anion gap had been closed for three days upon discharge from the ICU to the floor.
Given her elevated A1c ([**12-15**] % on recent [**Last Name (un) **] readings), macrosomia, and fetal congenital defects are quite possible.
Her current regimen of baseline humalog was titrated to prevent against transient hypoglycemia observed in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
She was counseled about the potential risks of leaving prematurely, including potential hypo or hyperglycemia on current insulin regimen as well as the risk to her fetus including death and deformity.
