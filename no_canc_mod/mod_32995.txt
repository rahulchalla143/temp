Admission Date:  [**2146-2-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2146-3-8**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**] Chief Complaint: Subarachnoid hemorrhage  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: conventional angiogram  History of Present Illness: Pt.
is a 84 y/o with a hx of HTN, MVP, who is transferred from OSH after a fall with SAH and SDH found on Head CT.
No other neuro exam documented.
Head CT was performed and showed diffuse SAH, and a small L frontal SDH, as well as subgaleal hematoma.
Head CT repeated here and showed a 1.7 x 0.9 cm frontal contusion in addition to the SAH and SDH seen on the prior study.
Past Medical History: HTN GERD MVP Palpitations (since she was a young woman)   Social History: Lives alone, family in the area (daughter [**Telephone/Fax (1) 77807**])   Family History: NC   Physical Exam: T- 97.8 BP- 129/71 HR- 67 RR- 16 O2Sat- 100% on vent Gen: Lying in bed, intubated HEENT: hematoma R occiput, moist oral mucosa Neck: in C collar CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally aBd: +BS soft, nontender ext: no edema  Neurologic examination: Mental status: intubated and sedated.
+ corneal bilaterally.
No observed myoclonus or tremor.
Left frontal lobe parenchymal hemorrhagic contusion.
Diffuse bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage within the sylvian fissures, parietal, and frontal sulci.
Severe white matter hypoattenuation most consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.
Small right occipital scalp hematoma.
Small left convexity subdural hematoma without significant gyral effacement or shift.
[**2146-2-28**] - CTA head  IMPRESSION: No short interval change in the pattern of subarachnoid hemorrhage, left subdural hematoma, and left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
No definite aneurysm is seen.
The left transverse sinus is not clearly visualized and the left internal jugular vein appears slightly small at the level of the skull base, likely congenital in nature.
In comparison with the prior study, there is evidence of mild decrease in size of the left frontal parenchymal hemorrhagic contusion.
Persistent and unchanged bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage within the sylvian fissures, parietal, and frontal sulci.
Unchanged small left convexity subdural hematoma, there is no evidence of midline shifting.
[**2146-3-2**] - CT c-spine  IMPRESSION: No cervical spinal fractures.
New tiny amounts of intraventricular blood within the occipital horns bilaterally.
Stable left frontal lobe parenchymal hemorrhagic contusion.
Evolving bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage within the sylvian fissures, parietal and frontal sulci.
The lungs show no evidence of acute consolidation or large pleural effusion.
There is, however, minimal left costophrenic angle blunting which may represent a tiny left pleural effusion   Brief Hospital Course: Pt.
is an 84 y/o with a hx of HTN who presents after a fall today.
She was confused and disoriented at the OSH, and when she was found to have diffuse frontal and parietal SAH she was intubated because of concern for deterioration of MS (not clear what exactly this deterioration was)  On initial examination she was still sedated, but opened her eyes to voice and grimaces, and moves both arms and legs purposefully to pain.
1) Traumatic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage- On repeat CT at presentation she was found to also have a small L frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage- most likely consistent with traumatic hemorrhage from contrecoup injury.
Although the SAH is also most likely traumatic, given how diffuse the hemorrhage was and aneurysm was ruled out by both CTA head and neck and conventional cerebral angiogram.
The patient was admitted to the neuro ICU and extubated following angiogram without difficulty.
Her dilantin was discontinued and she was followed clinically for evidence of seizure activity.
CT-C spine was obtained revealed cervical spondylosis without cervical fracture, and her spine was clinically cleared to remove hard C-collar.
Given large volume of blood present in the subarachnoid space she was monitored in the ICU for frequent neuro checks and then transferred to neurology step down unit.
In the neuro step down unit she was monitored for evidence of cerebral vasospasm clinically.
Repeat head CT demonstrated significant clearance of the subarachnoid hemorrhage so we felt that it was safe to titrate her off of the nimodipine.
2) She was started on Cipro on [**2146-3-5**] due to evidence of a UTI.
This demonstrated x2 species of bacteria - 1 - EColi; 2- Enterococcus.
3) Baseline mental status exam during this admission: waxes and wanes.
Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain for 7 days.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain, T > 100.4.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor Last Name **] Green Nursing & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: diffuse frontal and parietal SAH   Discharge Condition: stable.
Discharge Instructions: (1) please monitor mental status and neurologic exam (2) 7day course of amoxicillin started today due to sensitivities of a second bacteria species that were just revealed and likely resistant to cipro (s/p 3 day course) (3) obtain f/u urinalysis in order to make sure that the UTI has cleared.
