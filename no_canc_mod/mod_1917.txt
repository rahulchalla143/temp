Screen predicts possible synergy with selected          penicillins or vancomycin.
MODERATE GROWTH.
ESCHERICHIA COLI.
ESCHERICHIA COLI.
No acute intracranial process.
Right parietal craniectomy changes with associated underlying  encephalomalacia versus extra-axial chronic collection is stable at least since [**2149-12-2**].
Bilateral patchy opacities, which may be due to patient motion versus infection versus edema.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the distal [**1-14**] of the ventricle.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
No pulmonary hypertension or clinically-signficant regurgivant valve disease.
These findings are could represent LAD-territory ischemia, but in absence of coronary disease are also compatible with Takotsubo-type cardiomyopathy.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and preserved regional and low normal global left ventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2150-10-16**], left ventricular systolic function has markedly improved.
[**2150-10-22**] CXR 1) Near total resolution of left effusion with mild residual pulmonary vascular congestion.
2) Bibasilar opacities that likely represent residual atelectasis, however uni- or bilateral pneumonia cannot be excluded and should be correlated with patient's clinical status.
PROCEDURES - Intubation [**2150-10-15**] - Right radial A line [**2150-10-15**] - Right IJ Central Venous Line insertion [**2150-10-16**] - PICC line removal [**2150-10-16**] - Extubation [**2150-10-24**] - Right IJ Central Venous Line removal [**2150-10-25**]  Brief Hospital Course: This is an 80 yo F with h/o paranoid schizophrenia, anoxic brain injury, and advanced dementia with recent aspiration event presented from her nursing home with acute shortness of breath and hypoxia.
Hypoxic respiratory failure.
Her respiratory failure was likely [**1-13**] aspiration pneumonitis and complicated by HAP and pulmonary edema with systolic CHF (LVEF 20-25%) from IVF resucitation.
Her sputum grew out staph aureus and 2 strains of E. coli (see labs for details), so she was treated with antibiotics clindamycin and aztreonam for a total of 8 days completed on [**2150-10-23**] (D1 [**2150-10-15**]).
She was successfully extubated on [**2150-10-24**] after discussion with family regarding goals of care and status of no reintubation.
Sepsis, likely [**1-13**] pneumonia and bacteremia.
Patient initially had hypotention requiring pressors that was thought to be [**1-13**] sedation for intubation, but also had acute respiratory failure, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and elevated lactate.
There was concern of possible teeth abscess, but CT head was not able to capture and Panorex X ray was not possible given intubated status.
She has 2 sources of infection- HAP with MSSA and 2 strains of E. coli and coag negative staph aureus bacteremia.
These infections were treated with clindamycin, aztreonam, and vancomycin with 8 day course for HAP and further treatment for her bacteremia was held given that she was made [**Month/Year (2) 3225**].
Bacteremia, likely [**1-13**] to PICC line infection (placed on [**10-7**] for treatment of recent aspiration pneumonia).
Blood cx showed coag negative staph as well as enterococcus faecalis, suggesting PICC line infection although PICC tip was cultured negative.
She received antibiotics vancomycin to treat for the bacteremia as both bacteriae were susceptible, starting on [**2150-10-15**].
Pneumonia, likely HAP vs. aspiration pneumonia.
Patient has known history of aspiratioy and was recently treated for aspiration pneumonia prior to this admission.
Sputum grew out E. Coli and coag + staph aureus.
Repeat CXR showed improvement of the bibasilar opacification, which could also be atelectasis.
Cardiac ischemia, likely from demand with active diuresis and recent sepsis.
This was noted on [**2150-10-23**] when telemetry monitoring revealed new T-wave inversion with troponin up to 0.14.
Likely [**1-13**] anemia of chronic inflammation and sepsis.
She was on stress ulcer prophylaxis, and there is no signs of GI bleeding.
Diffuse pustular papular rash was noted on her back.
No definitive therapy was performed, but the antibiotics that she received for her infection could be helpful in treating her abscess as well.
# Anisorcia.
It was unclear of the chronicity and there was no known use of eye drops, breathing therapy, pupil dilation, head trauma, or anticoagulation.
CT head did not show herniation or acute bleeding.
After extubation, patient was started on pureed diet with thickend fluid for risk of aspiration as for comfort per family request.
She continued with Tylenol 650 mg q6h prn for pain/fever, bisacodyl 10 mg daily prn, Miralax daily prn, docusate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] prn, and clotrimazole for the rash on her back.
She was also restarted on a puree diet with thickened fluid for comfort with family/HCP aware of her aspiration risk.
# Prophylaxis.
2. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1)  PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation: can ho9ld for loose stools.
3. docusate sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
4. bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.

Level of Consciousness: Awake, but not responsive to commands, pt with severe dementia.
You were admitted to the hosptial with respiratory failure and you were intubated and brought to the ICU.
It was found that you have an infection in your blood as well as a PNA.
Also during your hospitalization there was a decrease in your heart function and some demand on your heart that caused us to feel that you had a heart attack.
