The patient was found unresponsive and caught under the dashboard.
He had a long extrication time.
His only obvious injury at the time was a head laceration.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
There was an abrasion over the left forehead and scalp.
Back:  He had no stepoff or obvious deformities.
Initial trauma workup and imaging included a chest x-ray demonstrated adequate position of the endotracheal tube and orogastric tube with tip in the esophagus.
No hemothorax.
Pelvic x-ray which was without fracture.
Following extubation the patient remained somewhat somnolent but with a nonfocal neurologic exam otherwise the sedation was held.
Given that the patient was somewhat somnolent he had a repeat head CT performed, this head CT demonstrated one small area of intraparenchymal bleed consistent with diffuse axonal injury verses artifact.
Given the nonspecific findings on CT it was decided to obtain an Magnetic resonance scan, performed on Friday evening [**2149-4-18**] and this magnetic resonance scan was significant for diffuse spinal injury.
For this the neurology service was consulted, felt that the patient's exam was significant for decreased processing speed.
Attention, concentration and poor short-term verbal recall.
The patient was felt to have relatively preserved procedural and remote memory but impaired frontal executive function including fluency, some word finding difficulty and impaired abstract reasoning and comprehension of complex commands.
I felt this exam once again consistent with [**Doctor First Name **] verses an acute concussional syndrome.
The [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation service was consulted and they recommended an acute rehabilitation for vertigo associated ataxia, cognitive therapy.
They felt there was no neurologic event that caused a seizure or stroke and wanted the patient to return to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] clinic on [**2149-5-19**] at approximately 12 noon.
