History of Present Illness: 81 yo F with history of HTN, hypothyroidism, depression, seizure disorder, recent right hip ORIF complicated by pneumonia, presents with continued difficulty clearing infection.
She was transitioned to levofloxacin on [**4-15**] which still had minimal effect.

Went to [**University/College **]where she majored in English with a minor in history and worked a number of different jobs after graduating but primarily worked in editing for a publishing firm and at one point as a medical researcher.
She ultimately had to quit work when she became psychiatrically ill in her 30s (also reports this is when her seizures started), and it appears this was all after she found her mother hanging after a suicide attempt, and her son says she has "PTSD" from this event).
She had been living independently in her own apartment until about 4 years ago but had been failing for about the last five years of that stretch with multiple falls which went undiscovered for days at a time.
She has been wheelchair bound for falls and cerebellar ataxia (possibly related to extended phenytoin use) for the last 6 years or so.
