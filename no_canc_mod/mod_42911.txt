Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated no angiographically apparent flow-limiting disease.
The LMCA, LAD, LCx, and RCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
The case was complicated by complete heart block requiring temporary ventricular pacing.
No angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary artery disease.
Case complicated by complete heart block requiring temporary pacemaker placement.
[**2-25**] TTE Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Impaired left ventricular relaxation pattern.

# CHB: Patient had a repeat episode of AVblock while temporary pacer wires were being pulled yesterday; a permanent DDD pacer was then placed.
EP interrogated pacer on morning of discharge; no issues.
f/u CXR showed no pneumothorax.
# PUMP: Patient has a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 25%, etiology unclear.
She also has a component of desynchrony from her LBBB that decreases her LV ability to contract effectively.
# CORONARIES: [**2178-2-25**] cardiac catheterization showed no obstructive coronary disease.
She was continued on aspirin 81mg daily  # Dysarthria: Patient stated on admission that she feels like she is unable to pronounce her words properly and is having difficulty speaking.
She denies any word-finding difficulty, and states that it is purely a vocalization problem.
[**Name (NI) **] that it is improving and has a normal neuro exam with no focal deficits.
These symptoms continued to improve until discharge without intervention.
# DVT Prophylaxis: Patient received heparin products during this admission.
Zantac 150 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for heartburn.
Disp:*2 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: # Complete heart block # Left bundle branch block # Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital because of worsening difficulty breathing with exertion, new Left Bundle Branch Block and a recent stress echo revealing a depressed contraction of your heart without evidence of ischemia.
During a right heart cath you had complete heart block and you needed a pacing wire placed.
During you admission, some of your medications were changed, you should take the following medications when leavign the hospital:  - metoprolol XL 25mg (ongoing) - clindamycin for 1 day after discharge  Please note that if you become lightheaded or dizzy or have chest pain you should call your doctor and/or return to the emergency room.
