There is also high attenuation material along the left tentorium cerebelli adjacent to the patient's focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
There is no evidence of hydrocephalus, or shift of normally midline structures.
Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
IMPRESSION: Small left occipital lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage with associated moderate edema in the distribution of the patient's known left posterior cerebral artery infarction.
There is also associated subdural hemorrhage along the left aspect of the tentorium cerebelli in this patient s/p cerebral angiogram with infusion of intra-arterial TPA.
----- Angiogram [**2108-1-31**]: Occlusion of a left P2 branch of the posterior cerebral artery with successful thrombolysis after infusion of approximately 20 mg of intraarterial TPA.
----- CT head [**2108-2-1**]: Again demonstrated within the left occipital lobe is an area of low attenuation, not significantly changed since the prior study, consistent with infarction within the distribution of the left posterior cerebral artery.
No intra or extra-axial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift in normally midline structures is present.
There is no hydrocephalus.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of left occipital lobe infarction.
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
----- Bilateral LENIs [**2108-2-2**]: No evidence of DVT in the right or left lower extremity.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear  structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
-----  Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 32 year old right handed woman with no significant past medical history presenting with visual field deficits and dizziness.
Findings on exam and imaging were consistent with left PCA infarct.
Stroke:  The patient presented with a left PCA infarct, confirmed by head CT and MRI.
She ruled out for MI by three sets of negative cardiac enzymes.
She was monitored on telemetry without findings of arrhythmia.
She was treated initially with aspirin, and then was started on coumadin for anticoagulation after absence of intracerebral hemorrhage was confirmed.
The post tPA area concerning for a hemorrhage was found to be consistent with contrast dye.
Given the patient's age and negative risk factors for stroke, a transesophageal echocardiogram was done to look for an embolic source.
Lower extremity dopplers were done to rule out DVT and were negative.
[**Doctor First Name **] and rheumatoid factor were negative.
On discharge she continues to have a right homonymous hemianopsia and mild right-sided weakness as demonstrated by mild right pronator drift.
She has dizziness and mildly unsteady gait; these are felt to be due to her visual field defects.
Cardiology: Patient ruled out for myocardial infarction.
No arrhythmias were seen on telemetry testing.
She follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the stroke clinic in about 4 weeks to discuss results of the hypercoagulable studies, further anticoagulation, and options for PFO closure.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Left PCA infarct status post IA tPA 2.
Patent foramen ovale   Discharge Condition: Persistent right superior quadrant anopia.
Problems with gait, coordination, and balance likely secondary to visual field defect.
Discharge Instructions: If you develop dizziness, visual changes, persistanct or worsening headache, numbness, or weakness, please call your neurologist, your primary care physician, [**Name Initial (NameIs) **]/or return to the emergency department.
