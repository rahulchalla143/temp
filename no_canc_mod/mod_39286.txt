Admission Date:  [**2154-1-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-1-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2121-6-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**] Chief Complaint: chest pain, arm pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2154-1-15**] - Catheter placement, coronary thrombectomy, coronary artery infusion of eptifibatide, Intravascular ultrasound, Coronary Angiography [**2154-1-18**] Coronary catheterization with placement of 2 bare metal stents to mid LAD.
History of Present Illness: This is a 32 year-old with a PMH significant for HTN, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who presents with a 3-day history of chest and arm pain that developed with exertion with some exertional dyspnea and fatigue.
The patient awoke Sunday ([**2154-1-13**]) feeling well and went to the laundry mat walking 1-block with bags full of laundry and developed some exertional dyspnea and left arm pain that radiated in a pulsatile fashion to his fingers; without frank chest pain, but with some diaphoresis.
When he returned home, his dyspnea improved with rest.
However, his left arm pain progressed to right arm pain even while resting.
This pain continued through Monday and early Tuesday morning he noted the left arm pain was [**9-5**] in intensity and was sharp in character, radiating to the left shoulder and back with some chest discomfort that was constant.
An EKG showed sinus tachycardia @ 119, NA/NI, 2-[**Street Address(2) 2051**]-elevations in lead V2-6, 1-mm ST-elevations in leads aVL, I and inferior lead reciprocal changes.
He was emergently rushed to the cardiac cath [**Street Address(2) **] where the patient was noted to have an abrupt cut-off at the mid-LAD with visible vessel thrombus of the mid-LAD and distal reconstitution with distal-LAD disease; underwent aspiration and ballooning of LAD via RFA access (closed with angioseal).
He remained chest pain free, but had on-going arm pain following the procedure.
On arrival in the CCU, the patient has some on-going left arm pain while resting flat, but no chest pain, diaphoresis, palpitations or nausea.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or pre-syncope.
ROS: The patient denies a history of prior stroke/TIA, deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus.
Denies headaches or vision changes.
No cough or upper respiratory symptoms.
Denies dizziness or lightheadedness; no palpitations.
No nausea or vomiting, denies abdominal pain.
No dysuria or hematuria.
No change in bowel movements or bloody stools.
Denies muscle weakness, myalgias or neurologic complaints.
No exertional buttock or calf pain.
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (diagnosed at age 19 year-old - blood glucose runs in the 150-200 mg/dL range; takes Lantus and Humalog) 2.
Hypertension  Social History: Patient lives at home with his wife, who is 9-weeks pregnant.
He stopped drinking 8-years ago for spiritual reasons.
He notes significant stress related to semester deadlines.
Strong family history of diabetes, hypertension and stroke.

EXTR: no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 2+ peripheral pulses DERM: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
This did not restore flow in the apical LAD and visible thrombus was seen to occlude the vessel there.
Perfomed intravascular ultrasound using the Atlantis catheter and this revealed mild diffuse atherosclerosis throughout the LAD and residual subocclusive thrombus in the proximal LAD.
A ChoICE PT XS [**Name (NI) **] was redirected into various branches of the distal LAD and an uninflated 2.0 mm balloon was used to "Dotter" across the apical vessel clot, but this did not restore flow.
It was decided that we would administer 18 hours of integrilin and IV heparin for at least 48 hours rather than cause distal embolization with stent, balloon or rheolytic thrombectomy.
He left the laboratory in stable condition with no chest pain.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
[**2154-1-15**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
No evidence of intracardiac shunt with agitated saline administration.
[**2154-1-16**] 2D-ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated.

[**2154-1-18**] CARDIAC CATH: Findings: ESTIMATED blood loss: <100 cc Hemodynamics (see above): Coronary angiography:  left dominant LMCA:  No angiographically-apparent CAD.
Visible thrombus in apical LAD with "train track" appearance with some flow in apex.
This demonstrated significant thrombus in the proximal LAD with a RVD of 5.1 cm.
There was very little atheroma.
A 4.0 x 22 mm Integriti stent was deployed and postdilated with a 5.0 mm balloon and residual thrombus was visible distal to this stent and thought to be due to uncovered (rather than due to prolapse or "toothpasting") thrombus.
Final angiography revealed normal flow, no dissection and 0% residual stenosis in the stent, no thrombus in the LAD up to the apex and no change in the apical LAD appearance.
[**2154-1-19**] 2D-ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 32M with a PMH significant for HTN, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who presents with a 3-day history of chest and arm pain that developed with exertion with some exertional dyspnea and fatigue found to have an anterolateral STEMI.
# ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME, ST-SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION - patient presented with acute coronary syndrome; no prior history of chronic, stable angina but he has notable risk factors including obesity, HTN, diabetes history and family history.
No prior cardiac catheterizations or known coronary disease.
EKG consistent with anterolateral ST-elevations with cardiac catheterization showing abrupt cut-off at the mid-LAD with visible vessel thrombus of the mid-LAD and distal reconstitution with some distal-LAD disease; underwent aspiration and balloon dottering of LAD via RFA access but given the need to avoid distal embolization, anti-platelet therapy was planned for 48-hours with a re-look planned.
Some on-going left arm pain and persistent ST-elevations and TWI in the inferior leads following the procedure resulted in starting Nitroglycerin gtt (evening of [**1-15**]), which was discontinued.
Visible thrombus in the apical LAD with "train track" appearance with some flow in the apex was also noted.
A 4.0 x 22 mm Integrity stent was deployed and post-dilated with a 5.0 mm balloon and residual thrombus was visible distal to this stent and thought to be due to uncovered (rather than due to prolapse or "toothpasting") thrombus.
Final angiography revealed normal flow, no dissection and 0% residual stenosis in the stent, no thrombus in the LAD up to the apex and no change in the apical LAD appearance.
He was also treated with Ibuprofen for suspected pericarditis, given a pleuritic component of his chest pain.
# DIASTOLIC HEART DYSFUNCTION - No historical evidence of systolic or diastolic dysfunction; no prior 2D-Echo reports and no physical evidence of heart failure noted.
Remains on an ACEI given diabetes for renal protection as an outpatient.
His echocardiogram demonstrated no PFO or atrial septal defects and his left ventricular function was read as normal with no global systolic dysfunction (LVEF 55%).
He did have evidence of diastolic dysfunction (grade 2) and for this we continued his ACEI therapy and he was maintained on a beta-blocker.
# INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS - He has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus diagnosed at age 19-years when he presented unresponsive and was hospitalized.
# HYPERTENSION - patient's home regimen included HCTZ and ACEI therapy given his diabetes.
Acute anterolateral ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction 2.
Grade II, diastolic heart dysfunction .
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 2.
Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) at [**Hospital1 771**] on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 regarding management of your chest pain and shortness of breath.
You were found to have an anterolateral ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (heart attack) and went to the cardiac catheterization [**Hospital Ward Name **] urgently where we attempted to remove the thrombus or clot in your heart artery.
This showed persistent clot in your heart artery and required 2 bare metal stents be placed in that artery.
You chest pain resolved and you were monitored without any additional events.
