This may represent an acquired versus congenital defect but given patient's clinical history of no pain in this region acute trauma/avulsion fracture is less likely.
No other acute fractures, dislocations identified  CT torso/abd/pelvis: Left posterior intra-articular acetabular fracture extending to the acetabular roof.
No other evidence for traumatic injury  CT c-spine: no fracture   Brief Hospital Course: Neuro: Patient had diffuse ICH bilat on CT.  Pt was AOx3 throughout hospitalization, without evidence of neuro deficits.
He was treated with dilantin for head injury, and was discharged on a 2-week course (total), with plans for f/u with neurosurgery.
CV: no issues Resp: no issues GI: no issues GU: no issues: Heme: Hematocrit stable throughout hospitalization, pt discharged on baby ASA while TDWB for DVT prophylaxis.
