Severe cervical spine degenerative changes are present, with moderate loss of disc space, anterior and posterior osteophyte formation, and subchondral cysts at all levels.
There is minimal anterolisthesis of C3-C4 and C4-C5.
Visualized brain is significant for global atrophy.
A non-specific density is noted in the right vallecula, which may represent secretions or retention cyst.
There are no pathologically enlarged cervical lymph nodes.
Coarse calcifications of the bilateral carotid bifurcation, right greater than left.
Imaged lung apices demonstrate a rounded density lesion at the left lung apex.
There is diffuse emphysema and pleuroparenchymal scarring.
No evidence of fracture of significant malalignment.
Multilevel severe degenerative cervical spine changes.
Partially imaged aortic abnormality.
CT head without contrast: -------- FINDINGS:  There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or recent infarction.
Ventricles and sulci are diffusely enlarged, compatible with age-related involutional changes.
A remote right MCA infarct is present, with encephalomalacia in the right parietal lobe.
Diffuse, partially confluent periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities compatible with small vessel ischemic disease.
Chronic lacunes are noted in the bilateral caudate heads, caudolenticular junction, and insula.
There are no acute fractures.
Mild mucosal thickening at the frontal ethmoid junction and right maxillary sinus.
No evidence fractures,  hemorrhage or recent infarction.
Global atrophy, old right MCA infarct, and microvascular disease.
pelvis XRAY AP: ----- no fracture  CXR AP: ---- IMPRESSION:  Severe mediastinal widening, concerning for aortic aneurysm.
Please refer to subsequent CT for further details  CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with and without contrast ------------- CHEST:  There is an 8-mm hypodense nodule in the right thyroid lobe.
At the lung bases, there is early fibrosis with subpleural reticulations, architectural distortion, and traction bronchiolectasis.
The trachea demonstrates a lunate morphology, which can be associated with tracheomalacia in the correct clinical setting.
No pleural effusions.
Dense calcifications are noted in the aortic valve.
Multiple prominent mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are present, but not pathologically enlarged by size criteria.
Note is made of a small sliding hiatal hernia.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation.
The kidneys are atrophic, but enhance symmetrically without masses or hydronephrosis.
Scattered pancolonic diverticula, particularly in the descending and sigmoid colon, without acute inflammation.
The prostate is slightly enlarged and heterogeneous.
There is no free intraperitoneal fluid or air.
No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph nodes.
There are also bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms measuring 1.7 cm, and diffuse ectasia throughout the iliac and femoral arterial systems.
Findings are most severe involving the distal arch and descending thoracoabdominal aorta, but also involve the root of the left subclavian artery and mesenteric/renal branch vessels with mild luminal stenosis.
No evidence of intimal flap or delayed contrast pooling to suggest dissection or pseudoaneurysm.
There are multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracolumbar spine, with right lateral bridging osteophytes.
[**Doctor Last Name **] type 1 thoracoabdominal aneurysm with extensive sacculation, mural thrombus, and ulcerated plaques.
Renal atrophy.
Colonic diverticulosis.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: 83 y/o man with poor functional status presenting s/p fall and was found to have large aortic aneurysm.
ACTIVE ISSUES .
# s/p fall: Pt underwent extensive trauma workup in the ED, including CT-head, C-spine, X-ray pelvis, CXR negative for fractures.
Physical exam also did not reveal evidence of trauma.
# Aortic Aneurysms: Because of the findings of widened mediastinum, pt underwent CTA chest/abdomen/pelvis in the ED, which revealed  [**Doctor Last Name **] type 1 thoracoabdominal aneurysm with extensive sacculation, mural thrombus, and ulcerated plaques.
There was no evidence of dissection.
CTA did not show dissection of the renal arteries but dilatations include renal arteries.

Dementia 2.
Hypertension 3.
Chronic CHF  Discharge Condition: Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
He presented to us after having a fall that seemed mechanical per history by the nursing home.
Vascular surgery evaluated him and did not find him a surgical candidate given the extensiveness of the disease and high risk procedure.
Blood pressure control will be very essential to reduce the chances of these dilatations to burst.
