He underwent a stress test which was negative by EKG standards, however, his symptoms were reproducible during exertion.
A cardiac catheterization revealed an 85% stenosed circumflex artery which was successfully treated with a drug eluting stent.
He had done well until this past [**Month (only) 116**] when he developed sudden onset of weakness, nausea and near syncope.
He ruled out for a myocardial infarction however a stress test was positive.
Repeat cardiac catheterization revealed severe two vessel coronary artery disease with instent restenosis of his circumflex artery.

No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
Trivial mitral regurgitation present.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
He did go into rapid atrial fibrillation on POD1 and was bolused with Amiodarone and started on oral Amiodarone, as well, with conversion to sinus rhythm.
Chest tubes were removed after being placed on waterseal due to a post operative small left apical pneumothorax which resolved on POD 2.
Post pull CXR showed small right pneumothorax.
Repeat CXR on POD 3 showed bilateral small pneumothoraces and subsequent films revealed resolution of the left and slow improvement on the right side.
Pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
By the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
