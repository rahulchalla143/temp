On placement of the TEE, it is clear that there is no ascending dissection and no AI.
It is not possible to discern an aortic lumen or to fairly assess the heart's fxn.
No AI or ascending dissection seen.
Pre-CPB: The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity.
AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus.
Moderately dilated ascending aorta.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild -moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild right ventricular cavity enlargement.
Dilated ascending aorta.
These findings are c/w a primary pulmonary process (COPD, bronchospasm, pulmonary embolism, obstructive sleep apnea, etc.).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Left lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged.
There are no large pleural effusions.
No acute pulmonary process.
DR. [**First Name (STitle) 10307**] HO DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3891**] MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2154-2-3**] 2:42 PM [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:59 year old man s/p TAA, chest/abd closure now blind REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: ischemic vs hemmorrhagic event Final Report:MRI OF THE BRAIN AND MRA OF THE HEAD AND NECK CLINICAL HISTORY: 59-year-old man status post TAA, chest, abdomen closure, now blind.
MR BRAIN: Multiple foci of decreased diffusion are noted in the brain, the largest of which is in the right occipital lobe, with corresponding T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity, consistent with acute infarcts.
There is also gyriform T1-hyperintensity in the right occipital lobe, likely representing cortical laminar necrosis.
Additional smaller foci of decreased diffusion are noted in the frontal and the parietal lobes, bilaterally, with involvement of the left precentral gyrus.
There is no mass effect, shift of midline structures, or evidence of a space-occupying lesion.
There is no extra-axial fluid collection.
Scattered foci of susceptibility artifact are noted within the brain, which do not appear to correlate with these foci of decreased diffusion.
Mild mucosal thickening is noted in the ethmoid air cells.
Fluid is noted layering in the nasal cavities and in the right maxillary sinus, likely related to the patient being intubated.
There is also fluid within the mastoid air cells bilaterally, also likely related to the intubation.
The bone marrow signal on the sagittal T1 image appears heterogeneous with foci of decreased T1 signal intensity.
MRA HEAD: There is normal flow-related enhancement of the intracranial internal carotid arteries, the anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries, the anterior and posterior communicating arteries, the vertebral arteries, and the basilar artery.
There is a slightly patulous basilar tip, with a prominence to the origin of the left superior cerebellar artery which may have an infundibular origin.
Otherwise, there is no evidence of a hemodynamically significant stenosis, dissection, or aneurysm (within the limitations of this MRA technique).
However, allowing for this limitation (and using both initial and delayed acquisitions), the common, internal and external carotid arteries demonstrate normal enhancement, without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis or dissection.
The vertebral arteries are grossly normal in caliber and enhancement, again without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis.
Multiple acute infarcts, bilaterally, the largest of which is in the right occipital lobe.
Given that (by DWI, ADC map and FLAIR sequences) these lesions appear to be of the same age, the distribution as well as the history, these are likely embolic in nature, related to a single event.
A few foci of susceptibility artifact, appearently unrelated to the foci of acute infarction, may be represent prior microhemorrhage, perhaps related to underlying hypertension or, less likely, prior embolic disease or underlying cavernous malformations.
MRA of head and neck is unremarkable, without evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis, dissection, or aneurysm (within the limitations of the MRA technique).
Heterogeneous bone marrow signal with foci of T1-hypointensity in the bone marrow of the calvaria and the visualized spine.
In a male patient of this age, this raises the possibility of a marrow-replacing process, and close correlation with laboratory data is recommended.

Developed intermittent A Fib on [**1-28**] and treated with amiodarone and cardioversion x4, has had several episode of going in and out of atrial fibrillation since that time.
EEG done [**1-29**] revealed severe encephalopathy for continuing neurologic deficits including bilat.

Ophthalmology was consulted and stated that the patient likely had posterior ischemic optic neuropathy bilaterally due to hypotension, in addition to occipital infarcts.
