male with HIV (CD4 540 in [**Month (only) 958**], HIV VL [**Numeric Identifier 9059**]), depression, and history of polysubstance abuse who presented with altered mental status after taking an overdose.
Per the patient he had recently been having problems with his social situation.
He was agitated and seemed slightly paranoid to his parents but otherwise was acting his normal self.
He had some abnormal movements, which his father who is a pyschiatrist did not think appeared epileptiform.
Toxicology was also consulted as the patient appeared flushed and warm but without fevers and they thought his presentation was most likely consistent with anticholinergic toxicity (though there was never any clear anticholinergic ingestion).
Past Medical History: -HIV w/CD4 of 540 in [**Month (only) 958**](on efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir in past) -Depression -History of polysubstance abuse (cocaine, EtOH, ecstasy, crystal meth): Sober [**6-11**] -History of MSRA pneumonia [**8-12**] -History of MRSA skin infections -History of syphilis (treated) -History of abnormal anal pap with low grade lesion (HPV)  Social History: History of abuse as a child and in [**Doctor Last Name **] care prior to being adopted at age 16 by two male partners (one of which is a psychiatrist).

No previous tracing available for comparison.
Chest Radiograph [**2186-6-14**]: AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Allowing for low lung volumes, mild septal thickening and peribronchial thickening may indicate early interstitial pneumonia or bronchitis.
There is no focal opacity or consolidation in the lungs.
The heart size is top normal, but there is no evidence of pulmonary edema or vascular congestion.
No appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
CT Head [**2186-6-14**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
Please note that MRI is more sensitive for subtle lesions, if there is a clinical concern.
M with HIV (last CD4 540), depression, and history of polysubstance abuse presenting with altered mental status post overdose of buproprion.
1) Altered Mental Status/Overdose: Initially, primary suspicion per toxicology was for anticholinergic toxidrome given apparent visual hallucinations, patient being warmed and flushed, and other signs.
Buproprion has some anticholinergic effect and intially there was some concern for a coingestion of the efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir combination the patient had previously been on for HIV and which would be another possible culprit for anticholinergic toxicity.
Of note, the patient's tox screen was negative for tricyclclics or acetaminophen.
Overall, the QRS never was >110 and never exceeded normal limits so there was extremely minimal suspicion for any cardiac toxicity predisposing to arrythmia.
In addition to anti-cholinergic toxicity it was also considered possible the patient was demonstrating an element of serotonin syndrome with his possible rigidity, tachycardia, and ?
His statement that he "wanted things to go away," his inability to contract for safety at home, and his impulsive action in the same home as two extremely supportive mental health professionals were very concerning for future danger after discharge.
As his mental status resolved he no longer needed this and was extubated without incident.
He never demonstrated further signs of respiratory distress.
He has no signs of opportunistic infections.
There is no immediate indication for treatment despite his viral load and he can discuss further treatment with his outpatient providers.
