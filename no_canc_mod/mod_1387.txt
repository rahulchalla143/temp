Imaging: CXR [**2137-5-27**] IMPRESSION: Small right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis, although an underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Coronal, sagittal as well as right and left oblique reformatted images were also generated.
Coronal and sagittal reformatted images of the abdomen and pelvis were also generated.
FINDINGS: CHEST: The visualized portion of the thyroid demonstrates a hyperdense nodule at the junction of the left lobe and the isthmus that measures 17 x 9 mm (5A; 6).
There is no axillary, hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
The aorta is of normal caliber along its course and shows no intramural hematoma or dissection.
The branches of the left pulmonary artery showed no filling defects down to the subsegmental level.
In the right main pulmonary artery, there is a filling defect that extends into the right upper, right middle, and right lower lobe branches.
The heart demonstrates calcified atherosclerotic disease of the coronary arteries, but no pericardial effusion.
A small simple right-sided pleural effusion is seen with associated atelectasis.
The left lung is largely clear with minimal atelectasis.
The spleen, pancreas and adrenal glands appear normal.
A hypodensity in the right mid pole is too small to characterize, likely represents a cyst.
Small and large intestine show no signs of obstruction.
Calcified atherosclerotic disease is seen throughout the abdominal aorta.
There is no filling defect of the IVC.
There is no lymphadenopathy, free air, or free fluid.
There is no free air or lymphadenopathy.
A filling defect is noted involving the left deep and superficial femoral veins extending into the common femoral vein and into the left external iliac vein, after which it resolves.
BONES: Mild degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracic spine.
A severe compression deformity is seen at the T12 vertebral body and to a lesser extent at the T10 vertebral body.
At the T12 level, there is approximately 8 mm of retropulsed material.
These are of indeterminate age, but the degree of sclerosis and degenerative changes around them suggests that they are chronic.
Large PE involving the right upper, right middle, and right lower pulmonary arterial branches, partially occlusive.
No evidence of right heart strain.
Filling defect extending from the left superficial and deep femoral veins all the way up to the left external iliac vein; no evidence of more central DVT.
Compression deformities of T12 and T9, while chronic appearing, no comparison study is available to assess for stability; correlate with exam.
Decreased intraventricular hemorrhage.
Near complete resolution of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Decreased right paratentorial subdural hematoma.
Interval resolution of subdural fluid collections.
- CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2137-5-28**] 11:38 PM Final Report INDICATION: 86-year-old female with traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, now on heparin for pulmonary embolus.
Evaluate for worsening intracranial hemorrhage.
FINDINGS: There has been near-complete resolution of subarachnoid hemorrhage, with tiny residual hyperdense foci along the parietal sulci (2:19).
Trace subdural hemorrhage also persists along the right tentorium cerebelli (401B:64).
A small amount of blood is seen layering in the bilateral occipital horns (2:15).
No new foci of hemorrhage, edema, or vascular territorial infarction are identified.
The ventricles and sulci remain prominent, consistent with age-related involutional changes.
Periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities are consistent with small vessel ischemic disease.
Dense calcifications are present in the cavernous carotid arteries.
There is no shift of the normally midline structures.
Stable trace subarachnoid, right subdural, and intraventricular hemorrhage.
No evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage.
Chronic involutional changes.
Oblique fx of mid-humeral diaphysis with continued 2 shaft width anterior, [**11-26**] shaft width medial displacement of distal fragement.
Interval resorption of fx lines and heterotopic ossification, but no successfully bridging callus.
Brief Hospital Course: Primary Reason for Hospitalization: Pt is an 86 yo F with history of HTN, HLD, R humerus fracture in cast, SAH, who presents from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for LLE swelling DVT seen on u/s.
Pt found to have PE in partially occlusive PE involving R upper, mid, and lower PA.
ECG shows some signs of RHS, but c/w prior, CTA without signs of RH strain.
Patient underwent filter placement on [**2137-5-28**] without complication.
Hypercoagulable studies were not sent given that this was a provoked DVT likely secondary to her immobility.
# Previous Intra-ventricular hemorrhage, SAH: Per neurosurg recs, benefits of anti-coagulation outweigh risk since bleed appeared stable on repeat head CT on [**2137-5-28**].
# Right humeral fracture: Pt sustained R humeral fracture after fall in [**4-3**], had closed treatment with splint and followed by ortho service as outpatient.
The ortho service re-evaluated her fracture while she was in the hospital and recommended....  #.
Normocytic Anemia: Hct drop from baseline low 30s to 26 on admission but then stabilized.
Iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease/inflammation.
HTN: Hypertensive on admission to systolic 160s.
Recently with hypotension at OSH, and new stroke thought to be [**12-26**] hypovolemia & multiple BP meds.
# Osteoporosis:  Continued Calcium, vitamin D  Transitions: On discharge Ms. [**Known lastname **] was well-appearing, breathing comfortably on room air.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Pulmonary embolus Deep vein thrombosis .
Secondary diagnoses: Subarachnoid hemorrhage Interventricular hemorrhage R humerus fracture Anemia Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Osteoporosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] because you had left leg swelling and evidence of a blood clot in your leg on ultrasound.
You had a CT scan of your chest which showed a blood clot in your lungs.
You were seen by the neurology service because of your history of a head bleed, and a repeat CT scan of your head showed that this bleed was stable.
You were evaluated by the vascular surgery service, who placed an filter in a blood vessel called the inferior vena cavae.
Unfortunately the orthpedic team was unable to see you while you were in the hospital, but you have an appointment in the very near future to have your shoulder re-evaluated.
