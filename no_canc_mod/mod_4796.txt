Pt also complained of associated dizziness.
This pain was completely resolved with SLNTG.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p MI [**2159**], PTCA [**2155**] HTN PAF Hyperlipidemia L cataract surgery Type II DM Hx of meningioma  Social History: 1ppd x 40 years, Denies EtOH or IV drug use  Family History: +Type II DM, HTN  Physical Exam: VS: Afebrile, BP 133/55 HR 65 RR 14 O2sat 100% 4L GEN: Laying in bed, sleeping HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, neck supple, unable to visualize JVD from obesity Lungs CTA bilaterally, no rales COR: RRR S1, S2, II/VI SEM at LSB ABD: soft, NABS, NTND, no rebound Extrem: + femoral pulses bilaterally, no bruits.
ST depression in V4-V6, I, aVL.
No significant changes compared to the EKG from [**4-26**] except for J-point elevation in III.
elevated LVEDP with LVEF 45%, +MR, infero basal akinesis, inferior hypokinesis.
EP ([**11-8**]): Showed 2 foci of inducible VT which pt became hypotensive requiring 200 J shock -> sinus rhythm.
The main foci of VT with same morphology as the presentation EKG, unable able to map out and ablate.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include thinned/aneurysmal basal to mid inferolateral segment and hypokinesis/akinesis of the basal inferior wall.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There were 2 foci that induced rapid VT resulting in hypotension requiring cardioversion with 200 J.
After transferred to the unit for observation, pt had 5 episodes of asymptomatic 30-50 beat NSVT that terminated on it's own.
Several hours later, pt had an episode of sustained VT lasting 1-2 min and subsequently had chest pain and became hypotensive to the SBP 50's.
Due to the history of paroxysmal a-fib, pt is recommended to be started on coumadin as outpatient.
Pt was discharged with metoprolol 50 mg po bid for rate control.
Pt got TSH and LFT's which were normal.
CXR showed no acute pulmonary processs.
Elevated LVEDP with LVEF 45%, +MR, infero basal akinesis, inferior hypokinesis.
Pt had an elevated CK, most likely in a setting of VT with old occlusion of RCA + LCx.
6)F femoral a. bruit: Pt noted to have R femoral bruit after the cath to the right groin.
Disp:*4 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Ventricular tachycardia CAD   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable  Discharge Instructions: Patient was instructed to take all of the medications as instructed.
Pt was instructed to seek medical attention if he were to develop chest pain, SOB, dizziness, palpitation, diaphoresis, syncope, pain at the ICD site, fever/chills, or any other concerning symptoms.
