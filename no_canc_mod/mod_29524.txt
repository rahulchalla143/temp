Admission Date:  [**2178-9-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-10-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2114-4-26**]             Sex:   M  Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]  Allergies: Lidocaine / Wheat Starch  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**] Chief Complaint: SSCP DOE  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac catheterization with stent placement   History of Present Illness: 64yo man with h/o CAD s/p multiple percutaneous interventions, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, who had SSCP 2wks PTA, was scheduled for ETT, had PND and palpitations on PM PTA, then NSVT on DOA during his ETT and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.
Pt's CAD history consists of angioplasty of OM1, OM2 in [**2165**], a crown stent placed in his LAD in [**2172**], a relook in [**2173**], and a cath in [**7-/2174**] that showed EF 42%, OM1 99% stenosis, OM2 100% stenosis, RCA 20-30% stenosis, LVEDP 12 mmHg, moderate global hypokinesis with LVEF 42%.
Patient was in his USOH until 2 weeks PTA, when he had SSCP while jogging on a treadmill that ended on its own, no associated symptoms, no N/V, radiations, no diaphoresis, [**4-25**] pain at worst.
In cath, pt was found to have right dominant system, single vessel coronary artery disease, LMCA clear, LAD patent stent, LCX with TO of OM2 branch, filling via collaterals, RCA tortuous mid vessel 50 to 60% stenoses, LVEDP 14 mm Hg, LVEF 53%, no MR. Pressure wire was placed in mid-RCA with FFR 0.6 (>0.75 indicating restricted flow); during attempts at stent placement dissection occurred, pt had [**8-25**] "elephant sitting on my chest" pain; one stent was placed proximal to the lesion, Fentanyl given, IABP started, pain relieved, pt sent to CCU.

The patient then had [**8-25**] pain "like an elephant was sitting on [his] chest."
He was given Fentanyl and a IABP for pain control and for increased flow to his coronaries.
CT [**Doctor First Name **] was emailed and made aware, though pt's dissection was managed medically without further evidence of CP, SOB, DOE, or PND.
Pump: Pt was on an IABP initially for pain relief and to increase flow to the stented RCA in the tortuous artery.
An attempt was made to wean the pump 1d post cath that failed secondary to hypotension.
C. Rhythm: NSR, intially with multiple PVCs c/w reperfusion of myocardial tissue but then stabilizing in NSR without ectopy.
GU: hematuria noted after anticoagulation and foley placement; after the foley and the anticoag were d/c'd this issue resolved.
