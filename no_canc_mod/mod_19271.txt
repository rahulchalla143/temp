Admission Date:  [**2160-10-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-11-3**]  Date of Birth:  [**2098-4-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 848**] Chief Complaint: Confusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 62 y.o.
During the flight, the patient reportedly had a VF arrest lasting approximately 4 mins with ROSC after epinephrine and CPR only.
During his hospital admission to [**Hospital1 18**], he was found to have a diffuse subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage, a SDH, a right scapular fracture, and multiple right lateral rib fractures.
The patient did have periods of delirium responsive to large amounts of benzodiazepines.
The patient reportedly was sent back to the emergency department at [**Hospital3 **] from rehab for "increasing confusion and lethargy."
Past Medical History: - Alcoholic Cirrhosis - VF Arrest (4min) - kidney stones - SAH, SDH, right scapular fracture, multiple right rib fractures  Social History: Lives in [**Location **] with [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 62212**] [**Doctor Last Name 636**].
No dysarthria.
No evidence of apraxia or neglect.
Extraocular movements intact bilaterally, no nystagmus.
Palate elevation symmetrical.
Mildly increased tone in [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 6816**].
Mild resting tremor in right hand.
No pronator drift.
Mildly increased tone in [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 6816**].
Mild action tremor in hands.
No pronator drift.
A 1 cm hypodense CSF attenuation of subdural collection overlying the left hemisphere, with rightward shift of 4 mm and decreased size of the right extra-axial space.
Right posterior parenchymal hemorrhage similar or slightly increased in size with surrounding edema.
[**2160-10-25**] MRI Head :  Since the prior examination, there is slight increase in size of what is likely a left cerebral hemispheric subdural hygroma causing mild effacement of the cerebral sulci, but no shift of normally midline structures.
The hemorrhages seen in the region of the septum pellucidum appear to have resolved but there is persistence of the small right parietal hemorrhage with surrounding edema, as well as the FLAIR images showing what is likely subacute subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There are no abnormalities on the diffusion images to suggest acute brain ischemia.
There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.
There is redemonstration of a small, polypoid area of mucosal thickening in the mid-ethmoid sinus on the right side.
CONCLUSION: Mild increase in size of left cerebral convexity subdural hygroma.
CT VENOGRAPHY OF THE HEAD: CT venography of the head demonstrates no evidence of vascular occlusion or thrombosis within the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of dural sinus thrombosis.
Over the series of studies, and in direct comparison to the [**10-25**] MR, there has been no definite increase in the size of the ventricles to specifically suggest the development of hydrocephalus; moreover, there is no evidence of transependymal migration of CSF.
Persistent small amount of small subarachnoid hemorrhage at the bihemispheric vertex, with expected evolution of the right frontovertex hemorrhagic contusion, but no other hemorrhage seen.
Now only a thin and progressively FLAIR-hyperintense subdural collection, layering over only the most anterior aspect of the left frontal convexity; this measures only 3.5 mm in maximal thickness and demonstrates no mass effect on the subjacent brain; there is only at most 1 mm rightward shift of normally-midline structures.
No evidence of acute infarction.
EEG [**2160-10-30**] IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine sampling showed a mildly slow [**7-6**] Hz theta frequency background suggestive of a mild to moderate encephalopathy.
There were no epileptiform features noted.
UA borderline positive.
Remained afebrile in ICU.
Altered Mental Status: Differential includes delirium from febrile illness, changes assosicated with increasing SDH and slight midline shift, increasing edema from R parenchymal bleed.
new right sided facial droop.
MRI head performed while in MICU - resolving contusion and area of restricted diffusion in R pareital lobe.. Meningitis was entertained as possibility but felt less likely given that per signficant other, the patient has been at this mental status since discharge.
Was tapered of dilantin, no evidence of seizure activity on EEG  4.
No acute management.
Initially the patient was very lethargic and confused and this was determined to be due to haldol dosing.
He was worked up with long term monitoring on EEG which showed only slowing and no epileptiform activity.
An MRI showed a slowly resolving contustion an area of possible infarct in the R parietal area which could be consistent with the patient's general state of confusion.

Seroquel 25 mg Tablet Sig: [**2-1**] Tablet PO QHS prn as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Encephalopathy - likely secondary to improving contusion and SAH/SDH   Discharge Condition: Improved.
Alert, oriented to name, place, date - (althouhgh consistently make mistake and says it is [**2158**], but realizes it is wrong) some perseveration and disinhibition.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with confusion and worsening mental status after you were discharged to rehab.
You came back with worsening confusion and were treated for a pneumonia and you were evaluated for seizure activity but did not have evidence of that.
Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner or return to the Emergency Department for any of the following:  * Any headaches, visual changes, weakness in any extremity or difficulty speaking.
*You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or tightness.
*New or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or wheeze.
*If you are vomiting and cannot keep down fluids or your medications.
*You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting, diarrhea, or other reasons.
Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, rapid heartbeat, or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.
*You have shaking chills, or fever greater than 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius.
*Any change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that concern you.
