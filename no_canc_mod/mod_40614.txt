Pertinent Results: [**2176-12-20**] CXR:  A diffuse patchy opacity in the right lower lobe consistent with pneumonia.
There may be a second focus of pneumonia at the left lung base versus atelectasis.
Question likely accompanying right parapneumonic effusion.
EKG:  Sinus tachycardia at a rate of 103.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 y/o M with DM, sleep apnea, admitted with nausea and CA pneumonia, developed aspiration pneumonia and then ventilator associated pneumonia.
the reason for re-admission to the ICU was an aspiration event.
He required intubation due to hypoxemia and developed ARDS.
He did have some hypotension while intubated, presumed due to sedating medications.
Nonetheless, given that he was low grade febrile and had a slight WBC count, his nafcillin was braodened to vanco and zosyn.
during his MICU course he was noted to occasionally have some loose guaiac positive diarrhea but never required transfusion.
RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient was admitted to the ICU with community-acuqired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonitis.
Sputum culture showed MSSA and he completed 12 days of gram positive coverage.
He did have a spike in WBC on [**12-31**] that has been trending down.
He has had chest discomfort with deep inspiration and with coughing.
He continues to have LLL and RUL opacifications on CXR, with developing RLL consolidation.
After starting this antibiotic course, he was afebrile with normal WBC.
NAUSEA: Patient had nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea on admission that resolved initially.
He did not have any [**Doctor First Name **] or bloody stools.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Ischemia ruled out by CE and ECG.
LUNG NODULE: He had a lung nodule noted on [**10-2**] CT abd and appeared more prominent than [**1-/2176**] study measuring 8mm.
Does have possible left lung base infiltrate as well but mass not visualized on CXR and seems less likely to represent postobstructive pneumonia.
Low MCV with h/o iron deficiency, but patient reports he is not taking iron any longer.
No c-scope in our system since [**2167**] at which time poor prep, but did not show significant pathology.
