She underwent a preliminary workup there which included an inadequate cervical spine, chest x-ray which showed multiple left-sided rib fractures and an inadequate pelvis x-ray.
No computerized tomography scans were performed.
She denied any loss of consciousness and was Medflighted to the [**Hospital6 1760**] directly from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital for evaluation of multiple head and face injuries.
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, appendectomy, diverticulosis with diverticulitis, lower back pain, pilonidal cyst.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Prilosec, Prinivil, Albuterol and Atrovent, Serevent, and Vicodin  ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination at the time she was afebrile with stable vital signs.
Her head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination was significant for a 10 to 15 cm laceration of the posterior scalp over the occiput through the galea down to the skull.
She had no sternal tenderness.
Her extremities, right shoulder demonstrated 1 to 2 cm laceration over the deltoid.
Her left upper elbow had significant ecchymosis and tenderness.
Her urine toxicology demonstrated opiates and alcohol.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  At this time it was felt that this was a 49 year old female in an unrestrained motor vehicle accident who had sustained multiple soft tissue and likely skeletal injuries who was stable in the trauma bay.
A trauma series was first performed which was significant for the following:  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax with clear lungs, no fractures documented.
The patient was taken to the computerized axial tomography scanner where multiple radiographic studies were performed including a computerized tomography scan of the head which demonstrated no masses, midline shift or hemorrhage, normal ventricles, no extra axial fluid collections, significant right orbital soft tissue swelling with fractures of the lamina papyracea, medial orbital wall and opacification of the right-sided ethmoid air cells.
There was intracaudal air as well as extracaudal air.
A small portion of the medial rectus muscle was immediately adjacent to the lamina fracture and it appeared that it could be partially entrapped.
There was opacification with bony fragments in the maxillary sinus, worrisome for an inferior orbital fracture.
There was fluid within the sphenoid sinuses suggesting fracture fragments and of the sinus cells as well.
Bilateral nasal bone fractures were noted with slight medial displacement.
There was also a fracture of the nasal septum.
There was a large scalp laceration with subcutaneous emphysema and skin thickening and also a subgluteal hematoma within the right posterior higher convexities.
The cervical spine was notable for no fractures or dislocations from C7 to T1.
There were multiple degenerative changes most pronounced at C4-5 and C5-6.
There was a right-sided aortic arch noted.
Incidentally there was no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy, no pleural effusion pneumothorax.
There were bibasilar posterior opacifications suggestive of dependent atelectasis.
There was no pneumothorax and no pulmonary infiltrates.
There was no free fluid.
The pelvis demonstrated an intact bladder with no free fluid within the cul-de-sac.
There were no refractures noted.
The patient underwent multiple radiographic films including the shoulder, chest and elbow as follows:  The shoulder showed no fractures visible; the elbow demonstrated normal alignment and articulation without any fractures.
Their evaluation was notable for no diplopia and no evidence of medial rectus entrapment.
An oromaxillofacial surgery consult was obtained for the orbital fractures which requested a orbital computerized tomography scan for further evaluation and the patient was noted to have a very large scalp avulsion type injury which was irrigated in the Intensive Care Unit with 1 liter of normal saline, infiltrated with lidocaine.
Also at that time, the right shoulder and right eyebrow lacerations as well as the nasal laceration were reapproximated using Prolene.
The patient also had a Neurosurgery consult.
A re-evaluation of the patient's computerized tomography scan demonstrated a right lamina process T9 fracture.
She underwent an magnetic resonance imaging scan at this time of her thoracic spine which was inadequate.
She was evaluated by Neurosurgery who deemed that her thoracic spine could be cleared with flexion, extension views.
She also underwent a repeat computerized tomography scan of the orbits and sella which demonstrated both medial and inferior wall blow-out fractures.
It was felt that she was stable for discharge.
Status post motor vehicle accident, complicated by right orbital fracture and scalp avulsion as well as multiple soft tissue injuries 2.
Hypertension 3.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 4.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease 5.
Diverticulosis  DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was discharged in stable condition.
