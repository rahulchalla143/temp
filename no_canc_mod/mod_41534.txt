Inferolateral ST changes likely [**2-10**] LV hypertrophy.
Allowing for these limitations, there is no evidence of pulmonary embolism in the main, lobar, or segmental levels.
There is minimal dependent atelectasis bilaterally.
The lungs are otherwise clear without pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
The heart is within normal limits, without pericardial effusion.
There is no lymphadenopathy observed.
[**2121-1-23**] LENI's BILATERAL: No DVT in bilateral lower extremities.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2121-1-27**] CXR: Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and there is distension of the azygous vein contour as well as prominence of the pulmonary vascularity.
