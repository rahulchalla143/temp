Admission Date:  [**2197-12-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2197-12-14**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] y.o.
A. fib w/ tachybrady syndrome, DM II, HL, CAD admitted to the ED from NSH w/ progressive SOB and low oxygenation status.
Per EMS report she was noted to have cyanotic fingertips.
Per the family she has felt unwell for the past few days, however, due to her underlying dementia she has not been able to explain her symptoms.
Labs were notable for a neutrophillic leukocytosis of 13.7, 87.8M, 6.7L.
Chest x-ray was notable for low lung volumes, possible RML consolidation, mildly blunted left costraphrenic angle secondary to pleural thickening vs small effusion, mild pulm vasc congestion.
She was given Zosyn 4.5gm IV x 1, Vancoymcin 1gm IV x 1 for empirical coverage for possible PNA and sepsis.
For the elevated INR she received 10mg IV Vit K and 2u of FFP  Per the ED a goals of care discussion was initiated between the family, ED resident/attending and PCP.
Comfort measures included initiation of morphine IV if the pt appeared uncomfortable due to pain or air hunger.
Pt would be able to eat a regular diet, no IV fluid would be given in spite of her oliguria due to risk of pulmonary edema.
No central lines, arterial lines would be placed.
Past Medical History: Atrial fibrillation, tachybrachy syndrome Diabetes type 2 Hypercholesterolemia Chronically elevated liver function tests Uterine prolapse ORIF s/p R hip fracture CAD s/p NSTEMI Hypertension s/p CCY h/o pelvic fracture Intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of pancreas - seen on CT [**2189**] Right ovarian mass - Previously felt to be benign per GYN Colon Polyps (10 noted on last Cscope [**2188**]) - recommended repeat  Cscope in one year which was not done (?
Tobacco: Denies Alcohol: Denies  Family History: Mother had CAD, HTN nousin had DM Brother had renal carcinoma .
HEENT: No scleral icterus.
CARDIAC: S1, S2, regular rhythm, rate (70s) LUNGS: Diminished BS noted over rt hemithorax, and base of the left lung.
Low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular markings.
Pulmonary vascular congestion.
Blunting of the left costophrenic angle, may represent a small pleural effusion vs thickening, decreased since prior study  CT: 1.
Large amount of intrabdominal/pelvic ascites.
Small right pleural effusion.
Hepatic cirrhosis.
Multiple intrahepatic lesions, not fully characterized on this non contrast enhanced study, but which are highly concerning for metastases vs less likely multi-focal hepatocellular carcinoma (given cirrhosis).
Pelvic ultrasound from [**8-/2197**] raised concern for ovarian neoplasm.
Constellation of above CT findings may be secondary to metastatic ovarian malignancy.
At least two subcentimeter peritoneal nodules, as above, concerning for metastatic process.
Low attenuation areas within the pancreatic body which appear to be increased in size from [**2191**], could be enlarging IPMNs, recommend further evaluation with MRCP.
Nodular left breast tissue, recommend correlation with mammography to further evaluate for underlying mass.
Goals of Care: As mentioned in the HPI in the ED after discussion with the PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) **] physicians the family did not want any bld transfusions, central lines, arterial lines, intubation or resuscitation (DNR/DNI) given the pt's current clinical status and evidence of extensive abdominal disease.
Following INR correction no lab draws would be obtained.
Pt was transitioned to nasal cannula given her discomfort with the facemask.
If pt appears uncomfortable or shows air hunger, family would be notified and Morphine IV would be started.
Septic shock: Pt initially presented for septic shock and was notable hypotensive to the SBP 70s-80s.
Suspect source may be from urinary, abdominal (biliary source given abdominal disease), or pneumonia (Right middle lobe consolidation noted on CXR and CT scan).
