Admission Date:  [**2178-3-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2178-3-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2129-10-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**] Chief Complaint: 48yoW with h/o ESLD [**3-6**] EtOH cirrhosis, Crohn's disease, chronic kidney disease, transfered from [**Hospital3 **] on [**3-8**] for persistent MRSA bacteremia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Admitted with PICC Femoral HD catheter placement  History of Present Illness:  48yoW with h/o ESLD [**3-6**] EtOH cirrhosis, Crohn's disease, chronic kidney disease, who was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital [**2178-2-18**] with liver failure, acute renal failure and hyponatremia, and is transferred now to [**Hospital1 18**] with persistant MRSA bacteremia.
The patient was initially referred to [**Hospital3 417**] ED [**2178-2-18**] from her primary care physician's office for evaluation of elevated LFTs, confusion, ARF (Cr 3.4), and hyponatremia (Na+ 124).
At that time she complained of SOB and productive cough.
She was transferred to the ICU [**2178-3-3**] with hypotension (BP 65/40) and treated for urosepsis after E.coli grew in her urine.
Exam was significant for pericardial rub, and echo showed a small-moderate effusion.
No vegetations were seen on TTE [**2178-3-1**], but she was treated for endocarditis with vancomycin/gentamicin.
Hospital course was also complicated by hypokalemia requiring repletion.
On presentation now she complains of chest pain when coughing, and cough productive of brown sputum.
She c/o midepigastric abdominal pain and low back pain, which is her baseline.
Past Medical History: COPD Crohn's disease Liver failure d/t alcoholic cirrhosis c/b portal HTN, esophageal varices Sciatica Osteoarthritis Chronic kidney disease   Social History:  lives with her son.
Family History: Father - h/o EtOH abuse, d. Alzheimer' dz at 64yrs Mother - alive, had stroke at 67yrs Brother - EtOH abuse MGM - EtOH abuse   Physical Exam: T 97.2 HR 69 BP 93/36 RR 33 95%3Lnc Wt 94kg pulsus <10 GEN: alert, speaking full sentences, appropriate, NAD HEENT: icteric sclera, PERRL (2->1mm), conjunctiva pale, OP clear, MMdry Neck: supple, no LAD, JVP 11cm CV: PMI nondisplaced, regular rate, murmer vs rub, II/VI supine, III/VI sitting Resp: left basilar crackles, no rhonchi, no wheeze.
IMAGING: CXR: AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY: There is a ill-defined opacity within the left lower lobe consistent with patient's known pneumonia in this region.
There is a small right pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe consolidation consistent with patient's known pneumonia.
Small right pleural effusion.
It is shrunken and the appearances are consistent with cirrhosis.
There is evidence of ascites.
No intrahepatic bile duct dilatation.
IMPRESSION: Technically difficult examination in a patient with cirrhotic liver with ascites with reversed flow seen in the portal veins.
Ascites .
ECHO: Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.19cm2) Mild to moderate ([**2-3**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Within the limits of the examination, no focal mass lesion is seen.
The pancreas is diffusely atrophic.
A serpiginous structure showing flow voids is seen in the right paraaortic/retroperitoneal region, with suggestion of communication between the superior mesenteric vein and the renal vein, probably representing a porto-systemic shunt.
No renal mass seen within the limits of this noncontrast examination.
Brief Hospital Course: 48 y/o female with h/o end stage liver disease, EtOH abuse, COPD, Crohn's disease, and chronic kidney disease, transferred from OSH with MRSA bacteremia, liver failure, acute renal failure, LLL pneumonia, enterococcus UTI, and hypotension.
She remained coagulopathic with elevated LFTs and hyperbilirubinemia.
She had no h/o large volume paracentesis.
She had been hypotensive requiring pressors, including vasopressin, raising the concern for pre-renal azotemia vs ATN.
HRS was also considered given her decompensated liver failure.
MRSA bacteremia: Her source was unknown but was being treated for endocarditis given persistant bacteremia despite therapeutic doses of vancomycin at OSH.
There were no positive cultures here.
Worsening LLL pneumonia on CXR at OSH could have been source of infection.
There was also a concern that her pericardial effusion might be infected/purulent pericarditis.
Spinal abscess or thrombophlebitis was also considered.
Multiple imaging studies were performed without clear source of infection (see above).
Hypotension: It was unclear what degree of hypotension this represented as patient's baseline SBP reported to be in the 80s.
Tachycardia/chest pain: Patient had an episode of A fib w/ RVR [**2178-3-15**]; likely [**3-6**] to fluid shifts w/ CVVHD and cardiac irritation from levophed.
She was asymptomatic during event, cardiac enzymes were flat.
She remained tachycardic but looked to be in MAT.
Psych evaluated her and determined that she did not have capacity to make her own decisions.
Hyponatremia:  It was thought to be hypervolemic hyponatremia given her ESLD.
There were no lab draws.
Cause of death likely end stage liver disease and infection.
