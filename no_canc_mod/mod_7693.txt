Admission Date:  [**2123-12-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2124-1-4**]  Date of Birth:   [**2082-4-14**]       Sex:  M   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 41 year old with history of recently diagnosed hypertension transferred from [**Hospital3 4527**] for acute coronary syndrome and hyperglycemia.
Approximately seven days ago or perhaps more he began having weakness in his hand.
Seven days ago he began having intermittent substernal chest pain, feeling "like a screwdriver is stabbing me", lasting approximately 30 minutes, moderately severe, occurring about two times per day.
No associated diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting or shortness of breath.
Initially there was no complaint of chest pain but during the Emergency Department course he began to complain of chest pain.
Electrocardiogram done showed ST elevation to 5 mm in V4 through V6 as well as milder elevation in 2, 3, and AVF.
In the laboratory he was found to have a right dominant system.
There was no significant left main disease.
The left anterior descending had a large thrombus at its origin.
His circumflex had diffuse disease with TO distal and TO of the first obtuse marginal branch upper pole with right to left collaterals.
The right coronary artery had mild diffuse disease.
Angio-jet was done with resolution of thrombus in the LAD.
The obtuse marginal upper pole lesion was dilated with a balloon.
There were no stents placed and he was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient was given a diagnosis of hypertension approximately three to four weeks ago.
He had a laminectomy in the past, and has chronic back pain after being hit by a truck.
He was an obese white male in no acute distress with multiple tatoos in restraints and ankle cuffs.
He had no lymphadenopathy.
He was tachycardiac with no murmurs, gallops or rubs with a normal S1 and S2.
The patient was mildly confused but knew the street, month and year.
His neurological examination was significant for decreased handgrip and wrist flexion and extension with also a decreased sensation in a similar area.
Cardiac - The patient was treated for his cardiac disease with a catheterization as above as well as aspirin, beta blocker and ACE inhibitor.
He continued to have chest pain.
It was initially described as sharp and intermittent, different from his chest pain with his myocardial infarction.
There were no associated electrocardiogram changes; later he complained of a dull constant substernal chest pain, also without electrocardiogram changes.
This pain was relieved with Morphine.
He denied any exacerbating or relieving factors though it was noted that he was more uncomfortable while transferring in between the stretcher and the bed, and thus pain seemed to be worse with movement.
Throughout this reported chest pain his creatinine kinases continued to decline.
He was noted to have severely reduced left ventricular ejection function on an echocardiogram with an ejection fraction of 20 to 30% secondary to severe hypokinesis of all but the basal segments of the left ventricle.
Given these findings and the thrombus in his coronary arteries as well as his recent cerebrovascular accident he was treated with hepariin and coumadin.
He initially did not demonstrate signs or symptoms of CHF, however following aggressive volume repletion in the setting of his hyperosmolar nonketotic state he eventually developed mild dyspnea and hypoxia, and was diuresed accordingly with good response.
Endocrine - Without a diagnosis of diabetes, the patient had symptoms and glucose consistent with hyperosmolar nonketotic state, the glucose over 800 and mental status changes as well as seizures.
He was eventually switched over to subcutaneous insulin, and his regimen was titrated up to achieve better glucose control; his total insulin requirement at this point is over 100 units/day.
Neurology - Right hand weakness, the patient was seen by Neurology and it was felt that his symptoms were consistent with cortical hand, consistent with a cerebrovascular accident.
Carotid ultrasounds were done with no clear evidence of source.
There was consideration for a right to left shunt, however, bubble study could not be done due to the patient's body habitus.
Due to the symptoms on [**1-1**], of left hand weakness, he underwent a head computerized tomography scan which was negative for any sign of bleed.
Neurological examination repeated by the neurology resident and was thought to be unchanged with no evidence for new or extended cerebrovascular accident.
His seizures were initially thought secondary to hyperglycemia but in the setting of his recent cerebrovascular accident, other etiology could not be ruled out.
Hematology - Due to his stroke, myocardial infarction and thrombus in his coronary arteries particular workup was begun for hypercoagulable state while he was anticoagulated on heparin and started on Coumadin.
Acute anterior myocardial infarction 2.
Diabetes with hyperosmolar nonketotic state 4.
Hypertension  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.
DISCHARGE STATUS:  Activity restriction secondary to large myocardial infarction with severely reduced ejection fraction as well as new cerebrovascular accident.
