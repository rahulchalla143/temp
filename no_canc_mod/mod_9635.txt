Admission Date:  [**2179-8-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2179-11-5**]  Date of Birth:   [**2179-8-3**]       Sex:  M  SERVICE:  NEONATOLOGY  HISTORY:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 43815**] is a former 29-1/7 week premature male born by emergent cesarean section for fetal distress at 29-1/7 weeks to a 28 year old Gravida 4, Para 3 to 4.
The baby emerged with spontaneous activity but poor respiratory effort.
PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY:   In [**2172**], normal spontaneous vaginal delivery term; in [**2174**], normal spontaneous vaginal delivery term; in [**2177**], premature rupture of membranes delivered at about 32 weeks, also positive for narcotics.
Mother with a history of depression on Klonopin and Serax.
Skin with no rash or petechiae.
Heart normal, regular rate and rhythm; S1, S2, no murmur.
Abdomen soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Patent anus, straight spine, no dimple.
However, he demonstrated persistent apnea and bradycardia noted to be clustered around feeds, with some spitting.
Due to the suspicion of gastroesophageal reflux his formula was changed to Enfamil AR, and the apnea and bradycardia resolved.
At discharge he has remained free of apnea and bradycardia for 5 consecutive days.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Initially, the baby required two normal saline boluses for hypotension and was started on a Dopamine drip with a peak dose of 10 mic per kilo per hour.
He had a presumed patent ductus arteriosus which was treated with one course of Indomethacin in day of life three and four.
He had an echocardiogram on [**8-9**], which is day of life six, which showed no PDA and a small PFO.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  Initially, the baby had a double-lumen UVC and [**Name (NI) **] line in place and was started on maintenance intravenous fluids.
He had parenteral nutrition and intralipids introduced on day of life one.
On day of life three, his [**Name (NI) **] was discontinued because of difficulty with patency and wave formation.
His current formula is Enfamil AR 24 calories per ounce because of gastrointestinal reflux which was clinically diagnosed.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The baby demonstrated physiologic jaundice with a peak bilirubin of 6.2/0.4.
On day of life 25, he had another sepsis evaluation for increase in apnea and bradycardia which was reassuring.
There have been no further issues with infection.
NEUROLOGIC:  The baby had serial head ultrasounds with his first on day of life seven which demonstrated a small right germinal matrix hemorrhage.
His last head ultrasound on [**10-29**] showed no new intraventricular hemorrhage, a tiny choroid plexus cyst on the right with further evolution of the prior germinal matrix hemorrhage, normal ventricle size and no PVL.
Ophthalmology:  He had his serial eye examinations with the last one on [**10-20**] when his eyes were mature.
IMMUNIZATIONS RECOMMENDED:  Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) 359**] through [**Month (only) 547**] for infants who meet any of the following three criteria:  1) Born at less than 32 weeks; 2) born between 32 and 35 weeks with plans for day care during RSV season, with a smoker in the household or with preschool siblings or, 3) with chronic lung disease.
Influenza immunization should be considered annually in the fall for preterm infants with chronic lung disease once they reach six months of age.
Before this age, the family and other caregivers should be considered for immunization against influenza to protect the infant.
Status post respiratory distress syndrome with subsequent chronic lung disease.
Status post physiologic jaundice.
Status post multiple episodes of rule out sepsis with antibiotics.
Small germinal matrix hemorrhage, resolving.
Gastroesophageal reflux 9.
Anemia of prematurity.
