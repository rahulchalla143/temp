Admission Date:  [**2135-1-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2135-1-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2076-9-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ceftin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**] Chief Complaint: STEMI  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent to Mid left anterior descending artery   History of Present Illness: This is a 58 year old male physician with past medical history significant for prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia as well as known CAD who presents today with anterior STEMI.
The patient was walking on the treadmill today when he suddently had onset of burning substernal chest pain with radiation down his left arm and to his jaw.
Onset of this pain was around 14:30 on the day of admission.
This pain was extremely severe, unrelenting, constant, and not relieved by anything he tried.
This was associated with dyspnea and diaphoresis.
The patient was concerned he was having a heart attack so he had EMS called from his health club and was taken to [**Hospital3 **] where EKG was consistent with STEMI.
He also had a brief episode of NSVT and thus received lidocaine drip prior to transfer here for further management.
On presentation to the [**Hospital1 18**] the patient went immediately for cardiac catheterization, which showed a 99% occlusion of the mid LAD at the point of diversion of the diag.
On arrival to the CCU he reports minimal chest pain, no shortness of breath, fevers, chills, or other complaints.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain, dyspnea, and diaphoresis during the event but he denies any DOE, PND, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope, or presyncope prior to today.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: - Diabetes, +Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension 2.
Family History: Notable for early coronary artery disease in his father and [**3-28**] uncles.
Diffuse ST elevations in I, aVL, V2, V3, V4, and V5 consistent with anterior STEMI.
No acute ST or T wave abnormalities.
Compared to previous ST elevations have resolved.
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD had a 99% thrombotic occlusion of the mid-portion involving the diagonal branch.
The LCX had mild disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left-sided filling pressures with mean PCWP of 15 mmHg.
Mildly elevated left-sided filling pressures.
CXR [**1-16**]: No active disease in the chest.
TTE [**1-17**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler, but cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
Interatrial septal aneurysm.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 58 year old male with past medical history significant for known CAD but no MI who presents with anterior STEMI.
# STEMI/CAD: The patient had a large anterior STEMI, and on cardiac catheterization, he was found to have a 99% thrombotic occlusion of the mid-portion of LAD involving the diagonal branch.
Patient had one episode of chest pain on the night after cath, relieved by nitro gtt.
# PUMP: Despite large anterior wall STEMI the patient had no signs/symptoms of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and his EF was normal.
He had no hypotension or signs of cardiogenic shock.
He tolerated beta-blocker, and his ACEI was held given concern for hypotension if ACEI is restarted.
# RHYTHM: Patient had very short run of NSVT at OSH but was in NSR during his stay at [**Hospital1 18**].
# DYSAUTONOMIA/PARTIAL COMPLEX SEIZURES: Patient has been relatively stable on home regimen of phenobarbitol and lamotrigine.
These two medications were continued, and he had no seizure activities during this hospital stay.
His ACEI was held given concern for hypotension if ACEI is restarted.
He was on 80mg atorvastatin and niacin in context of acute MI in the hospital.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Tablet, Sublingual Sublingual PRN (as needed) as needed for chest pain: Take up to 3 pills, if you still have chest pain after 3 pills, call 911.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Hypertension Partial complex Seizures Prostatic neoplasia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You had a very small anterior MI with positive troponins and MB index.
An ECHO showed no wall motion abnormalities and normal ejection fraction of > 55%.
A cardiac catheterization showed a large clot burden in the mid LAD with 99% occlusion.
Hold Ramepril for now, your NP should restart this if BP allows.
