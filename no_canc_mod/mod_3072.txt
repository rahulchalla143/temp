Admission Date:  [**2120-7-3**]       Discharge Date:  [**2120-7-30**]                                                 (Anticipated) Date of Birth:   [**2069-2-24**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MEDICINE HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of hypertension, anxiety disorder and substance abuse who was admitted to the [**Hospital3 17309**] intensive care unit on [**2120-6-27**], two days after undergoing an uncomplicated right knee arthroscopy as an but had become progressively more lethargic over the course of the second day following surgery.
By the evening, she had developed deep Kussmaul respirations.
On presentation to [**Hospital3 17310**], she was in acute renal failure with a creatinine of 3.3; preoperatively, it was 1.4.
She also was noted to have a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.
She was found to have a leukocytosis and spiked a temperature within 12 hours of presentation.
She was intubated on [**2120-6-27**] for impending respiratory failure.
The patient was weaned off pressors there initially and her renal function returned to baseline with resolution of her acidosis.
She still had evidence of hypoxemia, probably secondary to pulmonary edema from hypoalbuminemia and massive fluid resuscitation.
The patient acutely worsened on [**2120-7-2**] with worsening oxygenation and increasing PEEP requirements on ventilation.
Her chest x-ray looked markedly worsened and she began to spike high fevers,and was hypotensive again requiring pressors to keep her blood pressure in the 80s to 90s.
Anxiety disorder.
Substance abuse with a history of admission for detoxication evocation:  The patient had no history of intravenous drug abuse.
Posttraumatic stress disorder.
Degenerative joint disease.
ALLERGIES:  There were no known drug allergies.
She was unmarried with a history of ethanol use and drug abuse, but no history of intravenous drug abuse.
Generally, the patient was an obese white female, sedated and intubated.
There was no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy present.
There was no jugular venous distention detected.
On pulmonary examination, the patient had decreased breath sounds at the left base anteriorly and laterally, but otherwise the lungs were clear throughout with no evidence of wheezes.
On cardiovascular examination, the patient had distant heart sounds.
She was tachycardic with a normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The abdomen was obese with decreased bowel sounds.
The abdomen was slightly distended with no hepatosplenomegaly.
Her groin showed a moist, erythematous rash in the intertriginous region with a mild amount of yellow exudate at the right groin.
In the extremities, she had anasarca with no pitting edema and no clubbing or cyanosis.
She did have an ecchymosis at the left groin.
RADIOLOGY DATA:  On a CT angiogram with contrast done on [**2120-7-4**], there was no pulmonary embolism noted.
The tip of the endotracheal tube was in the right main bronchus with complete collapse of the left lung.
There was also an extensive ground glass opacity in the right lung with more focal areas of air space disease.
However, no massive pulmonary embolism was noted.
Bilateral lower extremity Doppler studies done on [**2120-7-9**] showed a partially occlusive clot involving the left common femoral vein.
CARDIAC STUDIES:  An echocardiogram done on [**2120-7-8**] showed the left atrium to be mildly dilated.
Due to a suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality could not be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity was dilated and a free wall might also be hypokinetic.
There was abnormal septal wall motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure volume overload.
No aortic regurgitation was present.
The mitral valve leaflets were structurally normal with 1+ mitral regurgitation present.
Severe 4+ tricuspid regurgitation was seen.
There was at least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The patient's acute respiratory failure post surgery was concerning for a possible pulmonary embolism secondary to fat embolism.
An echocardiogram done did not reveal evidence of right heart strain and a CT angiogram on [**2120-7-4**] did not show evidence of pulmonary embolism.
The patient was found, however, to have a left lung collapse from a right mainstem intubation.
The chest x-ray initially showed evidence of pneumonia, probably secondary to aspiration.
Her chest x-rays continued to worsen initially during her hospital admission and she was thought to have respiratory failure secondary to adult respiratory distress syndrome.
She was treated for aspiration pneumonia with a full course of Levaquin and Flagyl.
As there was some evidence for the use of steroids in the setting of adult respiratory distress syndrome, the patient was started on Solu-Medrol.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was transferred here requiring pressor support for hypotension secondary to sepsis versus hypovolemia.
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed on hospital day #5 to evaluate her pulmonary artery pressures, which were found to be elevated at 66/40.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was initially admitted with hypotension, which could have been secondary to sepsis with elevated white blood cell count and fever.
There was a likely pulmonary component to her decompensation, including an aspiration pneumonia for which Flagyl and Levaquin were started and a full 14 day course was completed.
She developed bacteremia again on [**2120-7-22**] with blood culture positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus.
HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was admitted with a decreased hematocrit, probably initially secondary to surgery.
She was also found to have guaiac positive stools.
The patient was transfused at [**Hospital3 17310**] for a low hematocrit and was transfused here with two units.
She continued on heparin for a positive left femoral deep vein thrombosis, probably secondary to the left femoral central line that was placed at [**Hospital3 17309**].
She was thought to have a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, initially likely related to some residual tubular dysfunction after acute renal failure.
DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS:  The patient was found to have a left femoral deep vein thrombosis for which intravenous heparin was started.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Adult respiratory distress syndrome.
