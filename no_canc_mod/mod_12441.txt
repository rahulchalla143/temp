HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old with chronic pancreatitis versus papillary tumor, right multiple abdominal surgeries.
She presents with chronic symptoms of abdominal pain and nausea and vomiting which occur with eating.
In the past, she has undergone esophagectomy with a colonic interposition and treatment of an apparent esophageal stricture.
She was last admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2161-9-22**] for acute on chronic abdominal pain.
After a few days of hospitalization, she developed what appeared to be an acute abdomen and she was transferred to [**Hospital6 15291**] where her primary general surgeon, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], was.
During the procedure, she underwent a seven hour laparotomy, much of which involved lysis of adhesions in an attempt at performing a pancreatic resection.
The procedure, however, was aborted apparently due to anatomic abnormalities introduced by prior surgeries.
A celiac alcohol ablation was performed instead for pain control.
Since the surgery in [**2161-9-22**], she has complained of worsening abdominal pain and inability to tolerate p.o.
TPN has been attempted in the past; however, due to extensive SVC, and internal jugular thrombi, a PICC line could not be maintained and this was not a current option.
She was recently switched from methadone to Oxycodone and slowly titrated up her dose for chronic pain control.
She describes that her pain is constant, sharp, and diffuse abdominal pain with intermittent diarrhea and constipation.
She has constant nausea but little to no emesis.
She denied any melena or bright red blood per rectum.
Chronic pancreatitis versus intraductal papillary mucinous tumor, status post sphincterotomy and five failed ERCP attempts.
Failed placement of pancreatic duct stent, status post alcohol ablation.
Hiatal hernia repairs times five.
Esophageal stricture status post resection and colonic interposition.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Her father died of a myocardial infarct at 56-years-old.
Maternal grandmother with breast cancer.
General:  The patient is an elderly female in mild abdominal pain, no apparent respiratory distress.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention was noted.
The neck was supple with no appreciable lymphadenopathy.
Chest:  Decreased breath sounds at the left base secondary to previous surgery, right fine crackles at the right base.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted.
No rebound or guarding, tenderness to palpation which was most prevalent in the right lower quadrant and left lower quadrant.
No incisional hernias noted.
No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Palpable peripheral pulses.
IMPRESSION:  This is a 68-year-old with chronic abdominal pain, extensively worked up in the past, admitted electively for feeding jejunostomy tube placement secondary to failure to thrive and inability to establish access for TPN.
However, due to her unusual anatomy with status post esophagectomy, her stomach was above the costochondral margin and was unable to be insufflated with either NG tube or Dobbhoff feeding tube.
Tube feeds were started at low rate after surgery; however, the patient developed significant nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and tube feeds were subsequently held.
A CT of the abdomen was performed on postoperative day number three which showed dilated small bowel with pneumatosis raising the question of obstruction versus ischemia.
A lactate level was sent at that time and was found to be mildly elevated at 3.6.
However, clinically, the patient did not have signs of acute ischemia and, therefore, it was felt necessary to repeat the CT scan with oral contrast for better evaluation.
A repeat CT scan showed delayed contrast passage but filling past the transition point (at the J tube insertion site) between dilated and collapsed bowel loops.
Therefore, the Surgical Team did not feel that there was significant obstruction at that point and tube feeds were restarted.
The nasogastric tube, however, was left in place and placed on low-intermittent suction and the patient's nausea and vomiting resolved.
The NG tube was clamped on postoperative day number ten and as the patient did not develop any emesis for 24 hours, the NG tube was discontinued the following morning.
Unfortunately, significant nausea and vomiting developed after the tube was removed and, therefore, it was replaced at bedside by the surgical attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**], on [**2162-3-9**].
An upper GI series was performed on postoperative day number nine and showed passage of barium with distended small bowel loops at the J tube transition site which was worrisome for mechanical obstruction.
The tube extended 37 cm into the small bowel which was at the site of previous jejunostomy feeding tube placed by General Surgery.
It was felt by the Surgical Team that if any mechanical obstruction had been occurring from the feeding jejunostomy tube that this would be lessened by placing a smaller caliber feeding tube.
A repeat upper GI series will be performed on [**2162-3-12**] to reassess for mechanical obstruction now that the smaller feeding tube is in place.
At the time of this dictation, it is unclear what the ultimate outcome will be; however, possible outcomes include:  Removing the J tube entirely and maintaining the patient on TPN, returning to the OR for repeat feeding tube placement, repeat attempt at pancreatectomy or gradual resolution of nausea and vomiting and no further intervention will be needed.
FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  As stated above, Mrs. [**Known lastname 36621**] was admitted for failure to thrive secondary to poor p.o.
TPN was attempted in the past; however, the line had to be discontinued secondary to chronic subclavian and SVC thrombi.
Her nausea and vomiting was difficult to control with antiemetics, however, Ativan and high-dose Zofran appeared to be most effective.
HEMATOLOGY:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 36621**] has a history of chronic catheter-associated thrombi in bilateral subclavian and Superior vena cava veins.
She is on Lovenox as an outpatient for possible hypercoagulable state which is being followed by a community hematologist.
However, given her history of breast cancer it could be malignancy related.
During placement of the midline she was noted to have obstruction of left axial A vein with collaterals from the lateral thoracic vein.
The procedure took approximately six hours and there were no difficulties encountered afterwards.
IV heparin was not able to be used due to inability to monitor PTT as peripheral blood could not be drawn.
Coumadin was not able to be administered as she has variable absorption due to chronic nausea and vomiting.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  On postoperative day number one, the patient had a temperature spike to 101.2 and was pan cultured.
She defervesced and there were no signs of infection by chest radiograph or culture data.
At which time, empiric coverage with Levaquin and Flagyl were initiated.
Coverage was discontinued after five days as she had been afebrile with a normalized white count.
She was re-cultured at this time and again culture data and chest x-ray showed no signs of infection.
For her acute pain after surgery, she was transiently on a Dilaudid PCA and was transitioned to p.o.
PSYCHIATRY:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 36621**] has a history of anxiety and depression and was continued on her outpatient regimen of Buspar, Elavil, Zoloft, and Klonopin.
Chronic pancreatitis versus intraductal papillary mucinous tumor leading to chronic nausea and vomiting.
Hypercoagulable state leading to chronic bilateral subclavian and superior vena cava thrombi.
