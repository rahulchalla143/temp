Admission Date:  [**2158-7-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2158-7-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2093-2-18**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: lisinopril  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**] Chief Complaint: Chief Complaint: melena, hematemesis, acute renal failure  Reason for MICU transfer: massive GI bleed, hypoxic resp failure   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endoscopy with banding of bleeding vessels   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 111791**] is a 65 yo M with h/o EtOH cirrhosis, PUD and ?CHF one year ago in setting of AFib (on Coumadin) who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital6 3105**] for hematemesis and melena.
Had EGD at LGH which showed large nonbleeding esophageal varices, gastric fundus obscured by blood clot.
No intervention was performed.
NGT was placed, no active bleeding.
He was seen by hepatology in ED who recommended deferring EGD until tomorrow, erythromycin to clear blood from stomach, maintaining MAPs ~70 to balance prevention of portal hypertensive bleeding with end-organ perfusion (given high Cr).
He had massive tense ascites.
A repeat endoscopy at [**Hospital1 18**] demonstrated grade III varices in lower third of esophagus, three of which were banded.
The patient's course was complicated by ATN thought to be secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of UGIB.
Finally, the patient had two episodes of R arm, shoulder, leg shakiness for a few minutes in the MICU.
He was given 1mg IV ativan, q4h prn agitation to cover for alcohol withdrawal.
An EEG was slow, encephalopathic, L hemisphere with sharp waves in arrhythmic waves, might have been pre-seizure activity, focus still active!
An MRI demonstrated global cerebral atrophy, but no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality such as hemorrhage, infarct or mass.
An unclear lesion at the superior-anterior aspect of the clivus was noted which could be related to the sphenoid sinus, although a lytic lesion in the clivus was not entirely excluded.
Denies history of withdrawal or DTs.

TE [**2158-7-3**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion .
Large volume ascites.
Global cerebral atrophy, but no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality such as hemorrhage, infarct or mass.
Unclear lesion at the superior-anterior aspect of the clivus which could be related to the sphenoid sinus, although a lytic lesion in the clivus is not entirely excluded .
EEG: [**2158-7-5**] IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The background was slow with bursts of generalized slowing throughout.
There were several left occipital sharp waves on the isolated recording just after midnight on the 21st, but these did not appear again later in the longer EEG  monitoring.
There were no definitely epileptiform features, and there were no electrographic seizures.
The slow background indicates encephalopathy, but the slowing was not as profound (and without typical "triphasic" waves) as seen typically in hepatic encephalopathy.
Brief Hospital Course: Hospital Course: This is a 65 yo M with h/o EtOH cirrhosis, PUD and ?CHF one year ago in setting of AFib (on Coumadin) who presents with UGIB and hypotension.
Acute Issues # UGIB: The patient p/w h/o EtOH cirrhosis and PUD, EGD at OSH showed nonbleeding esophageal varices and gastric outlet obscured by blood clot.
DDx included variceal bleed vs. peptic ulcer vs. oozing in setting of supratherapeutic INR (9).
A RUQ ultrasound revealed evidence of large volume ascites and cirrhosis.
A repeat upper endoscopy revealed 4 cords of grade III varices at the lower third of the esophagus and middle third of the esophagus (ligation).
The likely source of the bleeding was felt to be from esophageal varices.
There were no gastric varices noted.
On the floor, no additional episodes of bleeding occurred.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Likely secondary to hypovolemia from GI bleed.
Hepatorenal syndrome was also considered given tense ascites; elevated INR.
Renal was consulted and recommended in the setting of oliguria and volume overload, initiation of HD.
#HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY: Upon arrival to the floor, the patient was found to have asterixis and diminished ability to perform attention-related tasks.
# HYPOTENSION: Likely hypovolemia in setting of GI bleed.
Creatinine elevation likely represents poor end-organ perfusion, although lactates have been reassuring thus far.
Per liver, goal MAP ~70 to balance risk of re-opening portal hypertensive bleed with maintaining good end-organ perfusion.
# HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt became hypoxic at OSH after EGD, intubated for airway protection.
[**Month (only) 116**] have aspirated blood in setting of hematemesis.
Also has significant R atalectasis [**2-16**] elevated hemidiaphragm: likely tense ascites is causing elevated transpleural pressures.
After initiation of HD and large volume paracentesis, his respiratory status significantly improved.
While on the floor he had occassional episodes of wheezing which were treated with nebs.
# ELEVATED TROPONIN: Troponin 0.03 in ED, likely demand ischemia related to blood loss, also elevated in setting of renal failure.
He had no complaints of dysuria, frequency, or hematuria during his hospital stay.
Chronic Issues: # ?CHF: Pt reportedly has h/o CHF diagnosed one year ago in setting of AFib.
A TTE demonstrated mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
He is being discharged off of coumadin giving his risk of rebleeding.
Has ascites on exam and demonstrated on RUQ U/S.
Lactulose 30 mL PO BID   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7665**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Esophageal Varcies Alcoholic liver disease Acute Kidney Injury   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to the hospital with GI bleed from esophageal varicies and also found to have kidney failure.
The varices were banded and the bleeding has stopped.
We started you on hemodialysis for your kidney failure which will be continued following this hospitalization until a kidney doctor decides it is safe to stop.
