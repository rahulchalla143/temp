Cholelithiasis without secondary signs to suggest cholecystitis.
Echogenic liver most compatible with fatty infiltration.
Please note that other forms of hepatic disease such as cirrhosis/fibrosis are not excluded.
Cystic lesion in tail of pancreas, not fully evaluated on this examination.
Focal narrowing in sigmoid colon may represent focal collapsed bowel, however, bowel wall lesion cannot be excluded.
Severe hepatic steatosis.
Biliary tree shows no abnormalities.
Colonic wall thickening and mucosal enhancement, related to colitis as seen on recent CT scan.
Cystic, non-enhancing lesion in the tail of the pancreas, that is most likely in keeping with a pseudocyst, however, a side branch IPMN cannot be excluded, although less likely.
Jejunal biopsy negative.
No evidence of esophageal perforation.
Resolution of colonic wall thickening demonstrated on prior CT. 3.
Hepatic steatosis.
Low-attenuation lesion at the tail of the pancreas is compatible with a cyst versus dilated side branch.
It is unchanged from prior recent MRCP and CT. As described on prior MRCP report, followup of this with MRCP in six months is recommended to assess for expected stability.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
IMPRESSION: severe anterior and apical hypokinesis/akinesis; small, primari8ly anterior pericardial effusion possibly with early tamponade.
Selective coronary angiography in [**Last Name (un) **] left dominant system demonstrated no flow limiting lesions.
The LMCA had minimal plaquing in the mid portion of the vessel.
The LAD had minimal luminal irregulairites with 15% stenosis at the origin of the vessel.
The distal LAD wraps around the apex with diffuse plaquing in the distal LAD.
The Cx had minimal luminal irregularities and gave off a small caliber OM1, an atrial branch a modest OM2, a large LPL and a moderate LPDA.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left filling pressures with an RVEDP of 17 mmHg and an LVEDP of 28 mmHg.
There was mild pulmonary artery hypertension with a PASP of 38 mmHg.
There was no transaortic valve gradient on pullback from the LV to the aorta.

Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 41 year old female with seizure disorder, gastrectomy, degenerative disc disease who presented with vague GI complaints, weight loss, and admitted to CCU after an episode of chest pain and she was found to have severe systolic/dystolic function as well as tachycardia.
# Hypotension: Has been intermittantly hypotensive this admission but asymptomatic, likely [**1-2**] low EF.
Pt is not orthostatic or dizzy, is able to ambulate easily and denies any symptoms.
# Upper back pain: Pt has a history of lower back scoliosis, Myofascial pain syndrome and Facet arthropathy that affects her lower back.
Her upper back pain is new.
Pt feels that her pain may be [**1-2**] bedrest, and is relieved by morphine.
No radicular symptoms.
Noted increased filling pressures and furosemide and Lasix po started.
No O2 requirement or SOB at present despite fluid overload.
Unclear etiology but fatigue in last few months may be related.
Instructed to weigh herself daily and follow a low sodium diet.
# Nausea, weight loss: Pt had recent CT scan which showed pancolitis, and f/u CT scan which showed interval resolution.
Also w/ cholelithiasis and steatotic hepatitis.
Pt w/ fairly substantial GI surgical hx.
Symptoms may represent malabsorption syndrome, such as celiac sprue, or possibly related to surgical gastric resection.
EGD done, Bx showed inflmmation only.
Weight loss is at least in part r/t very decreased and erratic intake.
Pt describes very poor protein and calorie intake last 2 months.
Worsening depression is suspected.
She has had extensive nutritional counseling after her gastric bypass but would consider outpatient referral again.
No signs of acute bleed.
Had some rectal bleeding with stools recently, [**1-2**] hemmorhoids.
Increasing isolation, ahedonia and decreased intake all point to worsening depression.
Outpt psychiatrist was contact[**Name (NI) **] about symptoms and will f/u with pt.
Note that pt is very reluctant to discuss some information with her caregivers.
