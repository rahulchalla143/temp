Coronary artery disease.
Right subclavian stenosis.
Status post AICD implantation.
Left pleural effusion.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old male who was transferred from an outside hospital with initial complaints of increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion times four days.
He also had bilateral shoulder pain with exertion but never at rest.
The patient had an echocardiogram revealing an ejection fraction of 45-50% with inferior wall hypokinesis, moderate mitral regurgitation.
A stress ETT was elected and the patient had ST depression and 2:1 type AV block.
The patient did have a cardiac catheterization performed on [**2186-1-26**] which revealed 50-70% diffuse disease of the LAD, 60% distal of the LM, 50% of the proximal circumflex, 90% of the posterior circumflex after the OM.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient is an elderly gentleman in no acute distress.
There is a left eye prosthesis noted.
Neck:  Supple, midline, without masses or lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, without masses or organomegaly.
There does not appear to be any fluid wave.
There is noted to be a decreased pulse in the right extremity versus left.
The patient was seen to have some respiratory difficulty and was eventually placed on BIPAP.
The patient was also started on vancomycin for coagulase positive Staphylococcus from the sputum culture and a temperature of 106.9.
A liver biopsy was performed using a transjugular approach on [**2186-1-31**] which confirmed the diagnosis of cirrhosis.
The patient was diagnosed as a class A, Childs cirrhotic.
The patient was noted to have unequal pressures and pulse examination across the upper extremities with the left greater than the right and Vascular Surgery consultation was obtained.
On further examination, the patient was seen to have some mild right upper extremity claudication symptoms in a right-handed patient.
There were no clinical symptoms consistent with a subclavian steal.
Ultrasound and ultimately angiographic studies, however, did reveal total occlusion of the right subclavian artery with a moderate heavy calcification.
The right internal carotid artery had a mild 30% lesion and the right external carotid had eccentric 70% lesion.
The left common carotid artery was also normal, with a 30% lesion of the left internal carotid and the left vertebral artery having a 50% lesion at its origin.
The patient did also have an episode of AV block which progressed to paroxysmal advanced AV block with complete dissociation.
The patient continued also to have a great deal of mucus secretions.
On the evening of postoperative day number four, the patient had a chest x-ray which revealed a large left-sided pleural effusion.
On postoperative day number five, a repeat chest x-ray showed improvement of the lesion with aggressive chest PT and diuresis.
The patient should follow-up with his cardiologist in one to two weeks to address the need for continued diuresis as well as adjustment of other cardiac medications.
