CC: acute loss of consciousness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 22 yo female w/ bicuspid aortic valve c/b endocarditis x2 p/w acute LOC in setting of 3d N/V/D and fevers, no new CP or SOB, mild H/A.
Pt was discharged [**2109-10-1**] for endocarditis (thought to be chronic) after dental procedure.
Small, mobile echodensity was confirmed on aortic valve by TEE but pt remained afebrile througout hospitalization w/ negative cultures and was discharged w/o antibiotics.
She reports feeling dizzy but does not remember LOC, no clear head trauma.
She has had 3d of nausea, vomiting and watery diarrhea with abdominal cramping.
No melena, no BRBPR, no hematemesis.
She endorses a headache with prior dizzyness which has now resolved.
In general she has felt fatigued since her last admission with occasional dizzyness and h/o syncope of unknown etiology, no chest pain, no palpitations, no shortness of breath.
She denies night sweats but has had 16-lb unintentional weight loss since moving to [**Location (un) **] in [**Month (only) **].
Her GI symptoms feel improved but she had 4 episodes of non-bloody vomiting today with multiple episodes over past few days.
She denies sore throat or sinus congestion, +chronic dry cough w/o SOB, extremity swelling, dysuria or hematuria.
She had transient episode of SBP to 70s and received 2L NS.
Antibiotics for possible endocarditis were originally held then started in setting of hypotension.
Rheumatic fever [**2-6**] 5.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy followed by Heme-Onc, CT Surgery; radiographic surveillance, ?residual thymus 6. h/o Syncope   Social History: Graduate student in theater lighting and design and BU.
She denies tobacco/drugs and has occasional glass of wine.

CXR: no acute cardiopul process .
EKG: NSR 60s, nml intervals, nml axis, no ST seg changes, Jpt elevation V2-V3 TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT scan.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of the normally midline structures, or infarction.
There is no hydrocephalus.
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage or mass effect.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%) There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is a mild coarctation of the distal aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis  Brief Hospital Course: 22yo F s/p childhood repair of coarctation of aorta, bicuspid aortic valve and h/o endocarditis p/w 3-d h/o fevers, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, transient LOC and hypotension to 70s.
# Viral gastroenteritis  Initial transient hypotension was concerning given h/o fevers and h/o endocarditis but pt does not appear septic and has been afebrile since arrival.
However in setting of recent vomiting and diarrhea, pt is likely dehydrated and her BP has responded appropriately to IV fluids.
Presentation may be consistent with viral gastroenteritis.
Pt did have recent admission in [**Month (only) 359**] for possible endocarditis and was noted to have a mobile echodensity on TEE that was believed to be chronic and no antibiotics were started.
Patient improved clinically, diarrhea resolved and was taking fluids and eating by mouth.
# Syncope  Multiple episodes in past, attributed to hypoglycemia.
Pt now w/ hypotension which may account for her syncope.
Consider outpatient neurology consultation for autonomic dysfunction.
# h/o Mediastinal LN  Noted incidentally on chest CT obtained for blood-streaked sputum at last admission in [**Month (only) 359**].
Pt does have h/o weight loss over past months but no other concerning signs or symptoms.
# Weight loss  Likely due to recent diarrhea, nausea and vomiting alongside poor oral fluid intake.
Sent off for tissue transglutaminase to evaluate celiac sprue, this test returned back negative.
If patient continues to lose weight and has repeated diarrhea, will need colonoscopy to evaluate question of IBD.
She is also followed by heme/onc and CT surgery for question of mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
You were diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis.
Your symptoms resolved with IV fluids, other tests came back negative or are currently pending for specific viral sources.
Return to the ER if you have any further nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or any other worrisome symptoms.
