Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggestive of elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
Increased opacification at the left base with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms may be related to pleural effusion and atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 67 year old woman with history of uterine carcinosarcoma (diagnosed in [**2115**]; s/p XRT and hysterectomy in [**2116**], relapsed [**2118-2-9**] now s/p 6 cycles of [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol, last [**2118-9-1**]) who presented with hypotension.
Pt had been vomiting and had one episode of hematemesis in the ED after being sent over from clinic visit.
Also on the differential was infection potentially from a GI or pulmonary source.
Patient was treated with empiric vanc/zosyn which was continued for 5 days for treatment of pneumonia seen on CXR.
#) Coffee Ground Emesis: Endoscopy showed severe esophagitis.
The patient had no further episodes of coffee ground emesis while on the floor.
EGD showing severe esophagitis, no active bleeding, with mild gastritis/duodenitis.
There was a question on whether or not to treat for [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis but EGD did not reveal classic white plaques.
HOLDing Plavix  #) Anemia: [**Month (only) 116**] be active bleeding given report of coffee ground emesis in ED.
Likely also component of hemodilution after aggressive volume resuscitation.
Patient also chronically anemic which has been slowly worsening over past few months.
Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg PO BID   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Pneumonia Esophagitis Gastritis Duodenitis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted because of very low blood pressure.
You were found to have a pneumonia and started on antibiotics.
Because you had an episode of vomitting with blood in the emergency department the gastroenterology doctors saw [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and did an endoscopy (EGD) to look at your esophagus, stomach and small intestine.
There was severe inflammation in your esophagus and some inflammation in your stomach and small intestine as well.
