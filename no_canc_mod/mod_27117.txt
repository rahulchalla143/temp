FINDINGS: There are areas of increased hyperdensity along the sulci in the right temporal and insular regions, suggesting subarachnoid hemorrhage versus contusion.
Asymmetric extra-axial fluid collections, greater on the left side are seen, possibly representing sequelae of old subdural hematoma.
There is a component of hypodensity within the left extra-axial collection consistent with acute subdural hemorrhage.
Low density seen within the right thalamus possibly represents old infarct.
Soft tissue hematoma is noted along the right scalp.
Visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses appear normally aerated.
Areas of hyperdensity along the sulci in the right temporal and insular regions, suggest subarachnoid hemorrhage versus contusion.
Asymmetric extra-axial fluid collection, left greater than right, with hypodense component suggesting acute subdural hemorrhage.
Right-sided scalp hematomas.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: r/o expanding bleed  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 89 year old woman s/p 5 foot fall today.
FINDINGS: There are prominent bifrontal extra-axial collections, which appears increased (especially on the right) compared to one day prior.
Given acuity of increase of the size of this extra-axial collection, which is of CSF density, this most likely reflects an acute subdural hygroma.
There is a small area of hyperdensity along the along the dural surface of the right parietal region, which is unchanged and may represent a small subdural hematoma.
The small amount of subarachnoid blood in the right sylvian fissure is largely unchanged.
No new focus of hemorrhage.
There is no shift of normally midline structures, however, there is slight mass effect on the on the bilateral convexities secondary to the extra- axial collections.
The soft tissue hematoma/laceration along the right scalp is noted once again.
IMPRESSION: Increased size of bifrontal extra-axial collections likely representing acute subdural hygroma.
Stable appearance of small subarachnoid blood in the right sylvian fissure.
Probable small left parietal subdural hemorrhage, unchanged.
No new focus of hemorrhage.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute fracture or abnormal prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
Severe degenerative changes are noted throughout the cervical spine with mild grade-I retrolisthesis of C5 on C6, with disc space loss at multiple levels.
Visualized portions of the lung apices appear clear.
No evidence of acute fracture or abnormal prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
Cervical spondylosis.

Mild to moderate ([**1-31**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe/critical aortic stenosis with preserved LVEF.
At least mild to moderate mitral regurgitation with moderate MAC.
