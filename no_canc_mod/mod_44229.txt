This is a 49-year-old female with diabetes, blindness, status post transplanted kidney in [**2091**] for end-stage renal disease, initially admitted to [**Hospital1 536**] on [**2101-6-28**] for evaluation of a closed right humeral fracture that had converted to an open fracture.
She experienced an asystolic cardiac arrest in the Emergency Department and was intubated; sinus rhythm was restored with atropine (leading to ventricular tachycardia) and cardioversion.
Head CT scan showed no bleed and CT angiogram showed no pulmonary embolus.
She had borderline elevated troponin-T, with a peak of 0.44.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2101-7-4**] revealed no changes compared to the prior year; she had a total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery, and a 40% circumflex stenosis.
She underwent open reduction internal fixation of her humeral fracture on [**2101-7-12**].
Postoperatively, her course is notable for waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 2364**] mental status and intermittent disorientation/confusion, likely secondary to disorientation of her blindness as well as opioid analgesics for pain.
She has a history of delirium at prior hospitalizations as well.
Would favor changing to voriconazole if she is to develop fever without other infectious etiology.
End-stage renal disease.
CT scan of the abdomen revealed persistent air within the urinary collective system with the transplanted kidney with limited evaluation of the renal parenchyma due to the lack of intravenous contrast.
No further action was taken on this finding as it did not suggest an acute process.
Status post cardiac arrest:  No further events nor telemetry events.
Coronary artery disease:  No acute event in-house after cardiac arrest in the Emergency Department.
Contact your primary doctor with any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, fever, or swelling in right arm.
Asystolic ventricular tachycardic arrest.
Urinary tract infection.
Change in mental status.
