Admission Date:  [**2197-5-31**]       Discharge Date:  [**2197-6-14**]  Date of Birth:   [**2143-12-3**]       Sex:  M  Service: Liver Transplant Surgery Service HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old male status post orthotopic liver transplant on [**2195-8-2**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] who is recently noted to have an elevation of liver enzymes.
The patient was taken of severe stenosis verses clot and possibility of intervention.
Angiography showed severe stenosis of the artery through which a small catheter was advanced beyond the narrowing and the artery was found to be clotted.
End-stage liver disease secondary to Hepatitis B and C     and alcohol.
The examination revealed a middle aged male alert, oriented in no distress.
There was no swelling in the area of the groin where the catheter had previously been introduced.
There was no hematoma.
The extremities were warm and well perfused with no edema.
IMAGING:  Ultrasound as referenced in the history of present illness was significant for the inability to document hepatic artery wave forms by ultrasound.
Angiography, global arteriogram demonstrated mild atherosclerotic disease of the renal abdominal aorta.
There was a high aortic bifurcation noted.
The common Hepatic artery occluded abruptly and no distal branches were visualized.
Hepatic arteriogram demonstrated partially occluded common hepatic arterial lumen with multiple filling defects most consistent with thrombus.
There was reflux of contrast present.
At angiography initially a successful thrombolysis of the hepatic artery occlusion was performed.
There was evidence of a short but significant hepatic artery stenosis.
The stenosis was unable to be crossed with a balloon angioplasty catheter.
During the procedure the recurrence of a partially obstructing thrombi in hepatic artery both up and down stream of the hepatic artery stenosis.
A patent donor hepatic artery with a very slow flow across focal anastomotic stenosis was again observed.
Also there was luminal irregularity following the anastomosis which was interpreted as greater on the previous day with a widely patent vessel beyond the anastomosis.
Postoperatively the patient was transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit intubated, was subsequently extubated without incident.
On hospital day four this was the morning following the operation, the patient was taken back to angiography and a the saphenous vein graft was seen and there was noted to be patent anastomosis with swift flow however, there seemed to be a looped complex in the left hepatic artery with no flow past that area.
The patient continued in the surgical Intensive Care Unit and an insulin drip was started for an elevated blood glucose control.
The patient was hypotensive and not responding to fluid boluses and albumin so a Dobutamine drip was started.
A Swann-Ganz catheter was inserted for hemodynamic monitoring.
The Unasyn was discontinued, Vancomycin and Zosyn was started for antibiotics.
A heme consult for thrombocytopenia was obtained, the recommendations including stopping the Heparin.
They also recommended switching the proton pump inhibitor as well as brought up the issues were thrombocytopenia is likely secondary to a consumptive process verses decreased thrombopoietin.
The ultrasound showed patent hepatic artery on this day.
The patient was hypertensive and Zestril was restarted.
Repeat ultrasound showed patent hepatic artery and the patient remained in the surgical Intensive Care Unit.
A CT scan was obtained which showed right hepatic artery flow with no flow on the left, with a question of a change in the left lobe suggestive of infarction.
It was noted at this time that there was scrotal ecchymosis present.
Ultrasound showed both of the right and left hepatic artery and the common duct was also evaluated and measured 2.5 mm.
On hospital day 12, postop day eight, the patient had a new complaint of calf tenderness.
Hepatic artery thrombosis.
