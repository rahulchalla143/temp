Patient was transferred from PCP to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, where significant electrolyte abnormalities were noted.
CT abdomen/pelvis showed massively distended bladder and bilateral hydronephrosis.
During his time on the Medicine Service, he was given antibiotics for suspected urinary tract infection, provided electrolyte supplementation and fluids, provided a diabetic diet, and monitored for improvement of uremic symptoms, kidney function, and acid-base status.
Acute Renal Failure from bladder outlet obstruction: Patient presented to the hospital with inability to walk at home and with abdominal distension and acute renal failure.
CT showed massively distended bladder and bilateral hydronephrosis in the setting of likely BPH and recent use of opiates for back pain.
Foley catheter was placed to relieve the obstruction and patient's creatinine trended down from 27.4 on presentation to 1.2 on discharge.
Hyperkalemia: In the setting of patient's acute renal failure his potassium on presentation was 8.9.
ECG revealed peaked T-waves.
Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Patient presented with a lactic acidosis in the setting of renal failure and metformin use.
Metformin was held and renal abnormalities were corrected.
On exam he displayed asterixis and inattentiveness when asked to state the months of the year backwards.
Thiamine and folate supplementation were given if there was an aspect of unknown alcoholism, but ultimately correction of patient's renal abnormalities and monitoring led to patient's recovery of orientation and less less confusion.
By discharge he was A+Ox3, with no asterixis, and able to hold the attention to state the months of the year backwards.
Leukocytosis: Given the results of the urine culture and the urinalysis with lack of pyuria, the patient remained at low suspicion of urinary tract infection, and was thus taken off ceftriaxone, which was initially given for concern of UTI.
The patient did not have any adverse effects towards withdrawal of antibiotics.
Elevated CK/CPK/Trop: Patient developed elevated CPK during his hospitalization.
Ultimately the cause was supected to be mild rhabdomyolysis from hypophosphatemia, and CPK was downtrending on discharge with phosphate repletion and fluids.
Hypertension: The patient remained normotensive with some intermittent elevations of blood pressure throughout the stay.
Normotensive  with some intermittent elevations.
Patient should keep his f/u appointment with urologist for evaluation of his prostate, and opiates and anticholinergic meds should be avoided until prostate health is managed.

Secondary: hypertension diabetes   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
The obstruction seems to be a combination of enlarged prostate and use of pain medications with opiates.
This caused abnormalities in your blood chemistry which required urgent dialysis.
We relieved the obstruction in your bladder with a catheter and your kidneys recovered very well.
