REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Eval for hydronephrosis INDICATION: 81-year-old female with acute renal failure.
There are no stones or hydronephrosis bilaterally.
Left renal cyst.
No stones or hydronephrosis.
pulm edema  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 81 year old woman with ascites.
pulm edema HISTORY: Ascites with possible pulmonary edema.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-30**], there is little change.
Again there is some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with indistinct pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
Left pleural effusion persists.
The possibility of pneumonia at the left base can certainly not be excluded in the absence of a lateral view.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: evaluate for interval change  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 81 year old woman with L pleural effusion, ?
PNA REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: evaluate for interval change HISTORY: Left pleural effusion and possible pneumonia, to assess for change.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-29**], there is again increased opacification at the left base consistent with some combination of effusion, atelectasis, and pneumonia.
Pleas  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 81 year old woman with FTT, ascites, history of cirrhosis ?
INDICATION: 81-year-old female with history of cirrhosis and ascites.
Evaluate for intraabdominal pathology and mark a spot for tap.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: The liver is nodular and coarsened in echotexture consistent with underlying cirrhosis.
Within the right hepatic lobe, there is a 2.4 x 1.3 cm hypoechoic lesion with second questionable lobulated 4.2-cm lesion seen posteriorly.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
There are no stones or hydronephrosis.
There is a moderate amount of ascites within the right lower and left lower quadrants.
A spot was marked for tap in the left lower quadrant.
Two hypoechoic lesions within the right hepatic lobe concerning for hepatocellular carcinoma for which further evaluation with MRI is recommended.
A spot was marked for tap in the left lower quadrant to be performed by the clinical team.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-11-29**] 9:33 PM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: please r/o acute process  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 81 year old woman with HTN, DM2, with fatigue, nausea REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: please r/o acute process INDICATION: Fatigue and nausea.
Patchy parenchymal opacity is present at the left base with a left- sided pleural effusion again noted.
No pneumothorax, though evaluation of the left apex is limited by patient head positioning.
Degenerative changes of the left shoulder are partially imaged.
IMPRESSION: Persistant left pleural effusion and associated consolidation, likely representing atelectasis though pneumonic consolidation cannot be completely excluded.
# UTI:  Patient initially found to have a positive UA with many bacteria, positive leukocuyte esterase and nitrite.
Urine cultures grew pansensitive E. coli and Klebsiella sensitive to all but nitrofurantoin.
#Klebsiella Bacteremia- Patients blood culture grew out Klebsiella.
Patient had an episode fo hypotension thought to be secondary to sepsis.
Patients subsequent blood cultures had no growth and her blood pressure remained stable.
# Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis: Patient intially presentd with abdominal pain.
Patient had an abdominal ultrasound which showed nodular and coarsened echotexture of the liver consistent with cirrhosis and had a moderate amount of ascites.
She was given oxycodone for pain control.
# Pulmonary Effusion: Pt was initially tachynpnic likely [**2-26**] attempt to compensate for metabolic acidosis.
Pulmonary effusion chronic after sternotomy.
Pt was intially started on vancomycin and flagyl but discontinued as there was no evidence of pneumonia.
She was started on albumin, octreotide and midodrine for concern of hepatorenal syndrome.
Renal was consulted and felt the acute renal failure was secondary to renal hypoperfusion in the setting of her bacteremia, not hepatorenal.
# Hyperglycemia-Pts glyburide was intially held secondary to acute renal failure as well as pt not having PO intake.
# Liver Lesions: Abd U/S showed two hypoechoic lesions within the right hepatic lobe concerning for hepatocellular carcinoma for which further evaluation with MRI is recommended.
Pt also reports significant weight loss.
An MRI was not done because the patient had acute renal failure and her creatinine had not come down enough before discharge.
# Diarrhea: Patient has history of diarrhea on Lomotil at home.
She did not have loose stool during her stay.
#HTN: The patients medications were changed from Toprol XL to 25mg Metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] given intial hypotensive episode in ICU.
# Anemia: Patient has a microcytic anemia felt to be [**2-26**] iron deficiency.
# Nutrition-The patient was evaluted by speech adn swallow because it appeared that she had difficulty tolerating a regular diet without an aspiration risk.
She was cleared for a soft solid diet with nectar thickened liquids.
MRI Pt needs to follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and have him order an MRI with gadolinium to evaluate liver lesions   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Urosepsis Peritonitis Acute Renal Failure   Discharge Condition: Improved   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for a bacterial infection.
You were found to have bacteria in your urine and your blood.
You were also found to have an infection called peritonitis.
You were also found to have some incidental lesions on your liver found on an abdominal ultrasound.
