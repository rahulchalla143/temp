Before intervention was performed, she became intermittently febrile and hypotensive.
No clear source of infection was identified, but presumed to be post-obstructive pneumonia as she has had [**6-18**] pneumonias in similar areas in the past year.
She was initially managed with cefepime and vancomycin, but cefepime was stopped due to concern for allergy.
She did not undergo bronchoscopy in accordance with her wishes (she also had a recent bronch [**Hospital 47**] [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital for RUL opacity in [**Month (only) 205**], s/p bronchoscopy which revealed "diffuse mucus, cytology negative for malignancy" and also reportedly included fungal debris.
Her hypotension was managed with fluids in the ICU, and she was transferred back to the cardiology service.
She was seen by the Pulmonary team and recommended for a 4 week course of antibiotics (can be changed to Augmentin PO as outpatient) as well as the Infectious disease team for concern of fungal pneumonia.
She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient regarding her peripheral vascular disease.
Potential sources considered include lung, urine, Bone, PICC line infection (placed 2 weeks prior to presentation at OSH), GI (though no C. diff symptoms), but no obvious source found.
She was treated empirically with cefepime --> meropenem and vancomycin for concern of post-obstructive pneumonia.
Pulmonary team was consulted (due to upper lobe infiltrates, report of chronic Ghon complex in old medical records) and suggested post-obstructive pneumonia as source of sepsis.
They also suggested investigating alternative fungal sources of pneumonia (sputum stains and cultures sent and are pending).
ID was consulted and were investigating mycobacterial infection (non-TB).
There was also concern for ABPA, with elevated b-glucan and IgE, which could be a possibility.
# Hypotension: most likely [**3-16**] to sepsis +/- hypovolemia.
Resolved in the ICU with fluids, often occured after gentle diuresis for pulmonary edema.
?of GI bleed contributing given positive guaiac and low hematocrit.
Morning cortisol was 25 which speaks against adrenal insufficiency.
# Eosinophilia: On admission, she had a rash suspicious for drug rash, and this was thought to be [**3-16**] to either vicodin or ultram in OSH.
Regardless, they have remained elevated throughout her hospitalization.
# SOB/Desats: contributing factors may be pneumonia, atelectasis, COPD as well as congestion d/t aggressive fluid resucitation.
need for bactrim prophylaxis in the setting of chronic steroids.
# RUL infiltrate: Per OSH where bronchoscopy was done, no microbiology was sent on specimes, cytology was neg for malignancy.
In this patient on chronic steroids with bil UL infiltrates, there is concern for pulmonary fungal infection, ABPA, or histoplasmosis.
Also concern for eosinophilic pneumonia process.
Negative for pneumocystic jiroveci.
Max value of 6.6, with stable renal function and no recent K repletion.
Could be [**3-16**] trimethoprim-induced hyperkalemia or heparin-induced hyperkalemia (though very unusual).
- Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will f/u as outpatient for SFA stent, though she may be a poor candidate for general anesthesia .
# R toe ulcer: No evidence of osteomyelitis on MRA at OSH.
Continued wound care.
# Rash: Clinical appearance consistent with drug-induced rash (prior to Abx regimen).
Could also be a concern for lymphoma w/ eosinophilia and itchy rash, but unlikely.
# Urinary incontinence: Chronic issue.
No other symptoms or findings to suggest spinal cord or cauda equina issues.
# Neuropathy with inability to walk: Continued gabapentin, PT consult .
- Bilateral upper lobe patchy consolidation is likely related to infectious/inflammatory process.
Will not treat with increased prednisone at this time as no results, but may need increase in prednisone as outpatient if concerned for APBA.

Before we were able to perform more tests, you had a fever and low blood pressures.
Some blood tests that showed you may have had a fungal infection in your lungs.
You were briefly on respiratory precautions, but we have determined that you DO NOT have tuberculosis.
At this point it is difficult to tell whether you have a fungal infection in your lungs, but if you do, it is not a very acute infection and you do not need to be treated until the final results come back.
He plans to repeat your lower extremity angiography in ~3 weeks for your peripheral vascular disease.
