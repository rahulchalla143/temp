The procedure was complicated by postoperative bleeding and left hemothorax necessitating repeat operation on [**2159-10-18**] which revealed oozing at the left internal mammary artery branch.
He was admitted to [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital on [**2159-11-5**] with increased shortness of [**Year (4 digits) 1440**].
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for definitive treatment.
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No apparent deficits.
Pulmonary examination revealed the patient had coarse [**Month (only) 1440**] sounds throughout with decreased bilateral [**Month (only) 1440**] sounds at the bases.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
The sternal incision was healing well, with a positive click, with cough, without drainage, a stable sternal wound.
CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had left thoracostomy tube placed, #28 French tube, to 27 cm, and 200 cc of fluid were initially drawn; 1800 with positional changes.
A chest x-ray showed proper placement of left chest tube.
Cardiology was called on the day of admission for assessment of questionable tamponade physiology, and global left ventricular function was found to be normal without wall motion abnormalities.
The patient had difficult windows; however, the study demonstrated small-to-moderate anterior and apical adhesions without right atrial collapse or right ventricular diastolic collapse.
The patient continued to remain the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit and was found not to have tamponade physiology.
