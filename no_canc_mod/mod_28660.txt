She was taken to an OSH where a head CT showed a 0.9cm R SDH with a 0.45cm midline shift.
Pt has a h/o CAD with 2 stents, currently anticoagulated with Plavix and ASA.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
No pronator drift  Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements, heel to shin   Pertinent Results: CT head [**2200-8-25**]: FINDINGS: There is a mixed attenuation subdural collection layering along the right cerebral hemisphere, compatible with acute on chronic subdural hematoma, which measures up to 1 cm.
There is mild right- to- left midline shift measuring approximately 4 mm.
There is sulcal effacement along the right cerebral hemisphere.
No intra- axial hemorrhage or edema is seen.
There is focal calcification in the left basal ganglia.
There is nasal septal deviation to the right.
Mucosal thickening is noted in the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses as well as air- fluid level in the bilateral maxillary sinuses.
There is calcification of the carotid siphons.
Acute on chronic subdural hematoma along the right cerebral hemishpere causing sulcal effacement and mild shift of midline.
Small air-fluid levels in the maxillary sinuses and paranasal sinus mucosal thickening.
Right hemispheric acute subdural hematoma is unchanged in size.
There is minimal midline shift, which is also unchanged.
A small amount of hemorrhage along the left tentorial reflection is also seen.
There has been no extension of the hematoma or new hemorrhage seen.
There is mild small vessel ischemic sequela in the subcortical and periventricular white matter.
IMPRESSION: Essentially no change.
The subdural hematoma outlining the right cerebral convexity is unchanged, as is the amount of blood along the tentorial reflections.
No significant midline shift, hydrocephalus, or acute major vascular territorial infarct is identified.
Imaged sinuses are notable for scattered opacification of scattered ethmoid air cells and sphenoid sinuses.
Mastoid air cells and frontal sinuses are clear.
There is no evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
Aortic arch calcification is noted.
Degenerative changes are seen at the AC joints bilaterally.
There may be slight compression of a lower thoracic vertebra, though this is suboptimally assessed.
Degenerative changes are noted in the spine.
No evidence of acute intrathoracic process.
Possible compression deformity in the mid thoracic spine.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2200-8-27**] 5:23 PM Reason: pneumonia [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with pneumonia REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: pneumonia CHEST, PA AND LATERAL VIEWS IN COMPARISON WITH [**2200-8-25**].
There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle and haziness at the left base.
There is pleural fluid in both fissures as well as both costophrenic angles posteriorly.
The pattern is that of congestive failure.
Small patch of pneumonitis cannot be excluded, however.
CONCLUSION: Changes consistent with cardiac failure, however, a small area of pneumonitis cannot be excluded.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to neurosurgery service on [**8-25**] after a fall with a CT showing a 0.9cm R Subdural hematoma.
A chest-x-ray from her referring hospital was consistent with pneumonia and the pt was c/o cough with productive sputum.
Follow-up CTs on [**8-26**] and [**8-27**] showed no progression of her subdural hematoma.
Neurological exam showed no defecits on admission and remained normal throughout her hospital course.
Her pneumonia continued to resolve during her hospital stay, treated with levofloxacin and robitussin for cough.
