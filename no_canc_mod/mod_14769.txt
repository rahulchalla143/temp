There are trace bilateral pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax is seen.
There is a similar prominence and tortuosity of thoracic aorta in keeping with known type B aortic dissection.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
Similar appearance of tortous and prominent thoracic aorta in keeping with known type B dissection, better evaluated on recent MRI chest [**2176-9-20**].
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated left ventricle with moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressures.
No pathologic valvular abnormality regurgitation seen.
Small circumferential pericardial effusion.
Lungs are essentially clear with no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 37 year old man with hypertension, CKD, stable type B aortic dissection, and a previous hypertensive urgency who presented with dyspnea and hypertensive emergency.
Acute cardiogenic causes were ruled out with cardiac enzymes and an echocardiogram showing diastolic dysfunction, unchanged from prior.
He also had an evidence of acute renal failure and proteinuria likely from malignant hypertension.
The patient has a questionable history of obstructive sleep apnea but not on home CPAP.
He was educated about the risk of untreated hypertension several times.
