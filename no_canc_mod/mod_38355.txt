He takes coumadin for carotid stenosis with prior cerebral infarct and he was given vitamin-K and FFP x 2 units upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
Past Medical History: - Left carotid stenosis (99%) - Stroke [**2121**] (coumadin d/c'd for bladder surgery) - atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter - HTN - Intraventicular hemorrhage ([**2123**]) - s/p cholecystectomy - Angina - [**7-/2123**] EF 65% from OSH   Social History: - Tobacco: 60 pack year history - Alcohol: unknown - Illicits: unknown   Family History: Non-contributory  Physical Exam: ADMISSION EXAM: Temp: 98.3 HR: 86 BP: 150/100 Resp: 20 O(2)Sat: 95 Normal Pupils equally round and reactive to light Visual fields are full to confrontation Extraocular movements intact bilaterally no abnormal nystagmus Facial strength and sensation intact and symmetric Palatal elevation symmetrical Tongue midline without fasciculations C-collar in place No pronator drift Grip strength full bil IP full bilateral Coordination nl on finger-nose, rapid alternating movements  DISCHARGE EXAM - Unchanged from above, except as below:   Pertinent Results: Labs on admission: [**2123-12-27**] 05:30PM BLOOD WBC-13.3* RBC-4.41* Hgb-13.7* Hct-41.4 MCV-94 MCH-31.1 MCHC-33.2 RDW-12.9 Plt Ct-152 [**2123-12-27**] 05:30PM BLOOD Neuts-88.6* Lymphs-7.2* Monos-3.3 Eos-0.4 Baso-0.4 [**2123-12-27**] 05:30PM BLOOD PT-19.5* PTT-34.2 INR(PT)-1.8* [**2123-12-27**] 05:30PM BLOOD Glucose-91 UreaN-28* Creat-1.0 Na-145 K-4.0 Cl-107 HCO3-26 AnGap-16 [**2123-12-27**] 05:30PM BLOOD Calcium-8.9 Phos-2.3* Mg-1.9 [**2123-12-30**] 09:08AM BLOOD Type-ART pO2-58* pCO2-36 pH-7.44 calTCO2-25 Base XS-0 Intubat-NOT INTUBA [**2123-12-30**] 09:08AM BLOOD Lactate-1.2 [**2123-12-30**] 09:08AM BLOOD O2 Sat-90 [**2123-12-27**] 07:55PM URINE Color-Yellow Appear-Clear Sp [**Last Name (un) **]-1.015 [**2123-12-27**] 07:55PM URINE Blood-NEG Nitrite-NEG Protein-TR Glucose-NEG Ketone-40 Bilirub-NEG Urobiln-2* pH-6.5 Leuks-TR [**2123-12-27**] 07:55PM URINE RBC-1 WBC-2 Bacteri-NONE Yeast-NONE Epi-0  IMAGING:  CT Head ([**2123-12-28**]): IMPRESSION: 1.
Increased intraventricular hemorrhage, involving the occipital ventricular horns.
In comparison with the prior examination, the ventricular frontal horns appear slightly larger, with evidence of new areas of hemorrhage along the interventricular septum  MRA neck ([**2123-12-27**]): 1.
Severe left common carotid artery bifurcation disease with high grade stenosis and long string sign of the left internal carotid artery.
The V4 segment of the left subclavian is tortuous and narrow which may hypoplastic with possible atherosclerotic disease.
Atherosclerosis of the right CCA and origin of the bilateral vertebral arteries but no significant stenosis.
No evidence of fracture.
At C6-C7, there is a disc osteophyte complex flattening the spinal cord and causing mild spinal canal stenosis as well as bilateral uncovertebral and facet arthrosis causing mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing  Carotid Duplex ([**2123-12-28**]): 1.
Extensive homogenous plaque along the left ICA, with a very high-grade stenosis or near occlusion (99%).
0 to 40% stenosis in the right ICA  CT head ([**2123-12-29**]): Stable appearance of large intraventricular hemorrhage, with no evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus or new bleed.
No definite pulmonary embolism.
Smaller subsegmental branches of the lower lobes are slightly limited secondary to respiratory motion.
Secretions in the left mainstem bronchus as well as bilateral small lower lobe consolidations, which are likely related to aspiration.
Emphysema, and a 3 mm lingular nodule.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Minimal mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
CXR ([**2123-12-30**]): IMPRESSION: 1) Dense right lower lobe opacity and left lower lobe consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
2) Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
3) Mild vascular congestion compatible with previous CT imaging.
No significant change in the size or extent of the intraventricular hemorrhage.
No evidence of obstructing hydrocephalus.
CT Head ([**2124-1-1**]): Little change in size or extent of intraventricular hemorrhage.
Left pleural effusion is noted, at least partially loculated.
As compared to chest CT from [**2123-12-29**], the amount of the pleural effusion has substantially increased.
Anterior consolidation, better appreciated on the lateral view relate to left anterior upper lobe pleural calcification.
No new foci of hemorrhage.
CXR ([**2124-1-8**]): Compared to the prior study there has been interval decrease in the bilateral pleural effusions.
There is a subsegmental atelectasis in both lower lungs.
A 10-mm opacity seen in the left mid lung that was not present on the film from two days prior or chest CT likely represents confluence of shadows but attention should be paid to this region on followup.
Discharge labs:  Brief Hospital Course: 86 year old male with history of Afib/flutter on coumadin, HTN, stroke in [**2121**], and known carotid stenosis s/p fall on [**12-27**] where he suffered a left intraventricular hemmorhage with a hospital course c/b HCAP, atrial flutter with RVR and presumed C. diff.
A Cervical MRI was obtained and ruled out ligamentous injury and his collar was removed on [**2123-12-28**].
On that morning he was alert but had emesis and went to CT for a repeat study which showed an increase in ventricular hemorrhage with extension to the right venticle.
He was examined afterwards while he was getting his carotid duplex as part of the syncope work up.
He was lethargic and had nausea but was otherwise stable.
Subsequent head CT on [**2124-1-7**], which was ordered because Mr. [**Known lastname **] complained of worsening headache, showed interval improvement of intraventricular hemorrhage.
He was continued on Aspirin 325mg daily and heparin for DVT prophylaxis, which was acceptable according to the neurosurgery service.
On exam he continued to have poor air entry and showed evidence of bibasilar consolidations.
No PE was seen on CTA.
There was concern for aspiration and speech&swallow was consulted and there was note of silent aspiration with thin liquids on subsequent video swallow.
He received an 8 day course of vancomycin and Zosyn for hospital acquired pneumonia given that he was int he hospital over 72 hours when the pneumonia was diagnosed.
A parapneumonic effusion was noted on CXR, more prominent on the left than the right.
This improved on subsequent CXR with antibiotics and did not require thoracentesis or drainage.
On the afternoon of [**12-29**] he developed HTN with SBP>170 and tachycardia not responsive to metoprolol IV or fluid boluses.
#Hypertension: Goal SBP after his intraventricular hemorrhage was 90-160.
He had one episode of hypertensive emergency, SBP was in the 210s with chest pain, headache and pulmonary edema.
At discharge, BP remained intermittently elevated to the 170-180s with some readings in the 120s as well.
There was note of a 95-99% stenosis in the left ICA and 50% stenosis of the right ICA.
#Concern for C. diff: After finishing his 8 day course of vanc/Zosyn, he was noted to have a worsening leukocytosis and began to have loose stool.
His abdominal exam remained benign with no rebound or tenderness.
#leukocytosis: Patient was noted to have increasing leukocytosis over days prior to discharge.
He was not febrile and his pneumonia resolved.
Most likely this is due to clostridium dificile and/or intraventricular hemorrhage.
#Code status this admission: DNR, OK to intubate (confirmed with patient and daughter/HCP)  #Transitional Issues: -Goal systolic BP is 90-160, if SBP consistently >160, he will need uptitration of lisinopril or an additional antihypertensive -Pt will follow up with neurosurgery in one month, at which time CT scan of the head should be done and he should be considered for re-initiation of anti-coagulation therapy -Pt will follow up with vascular surgery regarding his carotid stenosis -Will need repeat CTA of neck in 1 month from discharge to reassess carotid stenosis -Control of his heart rate and atrial flutter should be re-evaluated as an outpatient, he may benefit from a A.flutter ablation once he is able to be anticoagulated -At discharge, he will remain on ASA 325mg daily but his warfarin has been stopped until he is seen by neurosurgery in follow-up -Lisinopril was changed to 10mg PO daily at discharge, this will need further titration at rehab according to his BP -Patient had urinary retention on day of discharge.
2. acetaminophen 650 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every four (4) hours as needed for fever or pain.
4. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
7. ipratropium bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
8. levalbuterol HCl 0.63 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing or SOB.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 5682**] Rehabilitation and Skilled Nursing Center - [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnoses: Intraventricular hemorrhage Hospital acquired pneumonia Atrial fltuter with rapid ventricular rate Presumed clostridium difficile infection  Secondary diagnoses: Carotid Stenosis Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
We discovered that you had developed a bleed within your head.
However, you developed a fast heart rate and worsened breathing.
We controlled your heart rate with medications and treated you for pneumonia with IV antibiotics.
Slowly we were able to control your heart rate and treat your infection and your condition improved.
There was also concern for a GI tract infection called C. diff, which can occur after treatment with powerful antibiotics.
We treated this with an oral antibiotic.
