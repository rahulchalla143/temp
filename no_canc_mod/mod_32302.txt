Moderate ascites.
This may represent reaccumulation of ascites in the setting of liver disease though bile leak not excluded given the provided history.
Mild bilateral hydronephrosis, unchanged.
CHEST, TWO VIEWS: Band-like linear density of the left lung base corresponds to atelectasis seen on subsequent CT of the abdomen and pelvis.
There is no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
No subdiaphragmatic free air is identified.
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar atelectasis .
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No vegetations seen.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2150-7-10**], the ventricular rate is now faster, the ventricular function is now hyperdynamic and moderate pulmonary artery hypertension is now present.
There are bibasilar opacities partially retrocardiac, but also continuing towards the more lateral aspect of the chest that appears to be worsening atelectasis, although underlying infection cannot be excluded.
Small bilateral pleural effusion is demonstrated.
IMPRESSION: No ileus, obstruction or free air.
Bibasilar consolidation slightly more than that seen on [**2151-2-25**], likely representing atelectasis although infection cannot be excluded.
Given history of recent procedures and perihepatic infection, multiple new small hypodensities in the liver are concerning for liver abscesses.
Increasing ascites and anasarca.
Diffuse colonic mucosal wall thickening and thumbprinting, non-specific, but infectious/inflammatory etiology such as C. difficile colitis is favored.
No secondary or vascular findings to suggest ischemic colitis.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Hyperdynamic systolic function, consistent with low systemic vascular resistance .
There is unchanged moderate overhydration with minimally increasing bilateral areas of hypoventilation.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia, no evidence of pneumothorax   Brief Hospital Course: 44 yom with hx of Hep C Cirrhosis recently admitted for CCY on [**1-/2151**] c/b bacterial peritonitis and perihepatic fluid collection who now presents with increased lethargy, abdominal pain, elevated WBC and jaundice after non-compliance with antibiotics at home.
# Abdominal pain/lethargy/WBC elevation/Hyperbili.
The BCx were pending at time of transfer to MICU, UCx were negative to date, there was no SBP and fluid collection preliminary cultures were negative, however smear was with 4+ PMNs.
was not tachycardic on admission, however, had progressively increasing HR which was felt to be due to either worsening infection vs. GIB.
WBC was stable, patient was started on Zosyn empirically for a presumed intraabdominal infection and restarted on Linezolid.
Serial exams showed worsening ascites and increasing lethargy and weakness.
ECHO was obtained to assess for Cx negative endocarditis as a possible source due to worsening murmur on exam, no vegetations were noted.
Patient had a progressively increasing AG on Chem 7 felt to be due to worsening acidosis and renal failure.
He had a developing hypercalcemia.
His ABG was 66* 34* 7.14*4 12, showing severe acidosis and hypoxemia.
Patient had a slowly dropping HCT during first 3 days of admission, then continued to remain aroudn 22, despite 2U daily.
gastrophaty, vs. new varices.
Patient with chronic anemia at baseline so hemolysis less concerning and most of bili is direct, however difficult to assess given liver failure.
was also hyperdynamic on exam, and did not respond to an initial fluids challenge, thus concern for hepatorenal.
Patient had slight hydronephrosis on CT [**2-13**].
# Hep C Cirrhosis: Patient's home fursemide and atenolol were held in setting of infection.
The patient was transferred to the MICU for hemodynamic instability and elevated lactate.
During his initial survey and access placement he developed a lower GI bleed.
He was stabilized with continually elevating lactate.
Surgery, GI, Renal & Infectious disease were consulted to provide recommendations to comment on refractory acidosis, pancolitis (C. Diff), oliguric renal failure, worsening liver failure and persistant hypotension.
He was found to be a non-operative or endoscopic candidate and hemodialysis was not offered.
Medications on Admission: Linezolid 600mg PO q12h (not taking) Levothyroxine 75mcg daily Clotrimazole 10 Troch PRN 5 times daily Oxycodone 5mg q4h PRN pain Lactulose 30mg PO TID Methadone 10mg daily Docusate Senna Midodrine 5mg TID Atenolol 50mg daily Furosemide 40mg [**Hospital1 **]   Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Death due to hemodynamic collapse and sepsis.
