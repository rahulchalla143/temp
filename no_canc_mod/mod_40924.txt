HISTORY: Large decubitus ulcers and sepsis.
This study is further limited by body habitus.
No gross consolidation or superimposed edema is evident.
Small bilateral pleural effusions cannot be entirely excluded as costophrenic angles are blunted.
No large effusion is evident.
There is no pneumothorax.
No gross consolidation or failure noted.
Likely small bilateral pleural effusions.
In the SICU he was started on antibiotics(zosyn and linezolid), given blood transfusions, and the bleeding from his ulcer was controlled with cautery and pressure.
Due to the proximity of his ulcer to his rectum he was taken to the operating room with the general surgery service on [**2179-9-29**] for a colostomy to divert stool away from the wound.
Post-operatively he was noted to have low UOP and was treated with fluid boluses for this.
While in house he was also seen by the ostomy service who had difficulty securing his appliance.
He does have a rectal tube in place for containment of his residual stool.
The decision was made that his ulcer requires no further debriedment and he was transferred back to acute care rehab on [**2179-10-6**] in stable condition.
He was able to tolerate daily dressing changes with wet-to-dry curlex without difficulty.
