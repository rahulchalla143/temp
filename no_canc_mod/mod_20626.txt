The combination of changes most likely suggests extensive degenerative change with degenerative pseudotumor with moderate compression of the spinal cord and moderate-to-severe spinal stenosis at C1 level.
Multilevel degenerative changes are also noted at other levels as described above.
CTA Neck [**2-15**]: No evidence of vascular occlusion or stenosis identified.
In particular, no vertebral artery occlusion or displacement identified.
Degenerative changes at the craniocervical junction with thickening ligaments as noted on the previous MRI.
No definite residual tissue is detected although small amounts may be obscured by the expected postoperative changes.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the NSurg service for pain control and for further evaluation of this cervical lesion.
It was decided that she have an open biopsy of this cervical lesion to yeild diagnosis.
Pathology revealed hematoma and not malignancy therefore steroid was discontinued.
No definite residual tissue is detected although small amounts may be obscured by the expected postoperative changes.
On POD#2, her surgical dressing was removed showing a small amount of erythema, however no obvious drainage or foul odor.
Keep your wound(s) clean and dry / No tub baths or pool swimming for two weeks from your date of surgery ??????
No pulling up, lifting more than 10 lbs., or excessive bending or twisting.
