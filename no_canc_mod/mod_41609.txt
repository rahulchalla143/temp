The circumstances around this are unclear, but apparently she was taking tylenol to treat a fever and additionally took some nyquil.
She was taken to Rush medical Center in [**Location (un) **] and ultimately was diagnosed with cirrhosis; notably her hospital course was complicated by MSSA bacteremia and pneumonia for which she was treated with IV antibiotics.
She was admitted to [**Hospital 40074**]Hospital with fever, RUQ pain and jaundice on [**2181-7-26**], additionally was found to have abdominal distension.
Workup demonstrated liver failure with poor synthetic function including INR of 2.9 and albumin 1.5, additionally she had thrombocytopenia and hyponatremia.
GI workup was negative for clostridium difficile and the likely culprit for her abdominal distension, in addition to the ascites, was felt to be a distal obstruction syndrome.
Reportedly she recieved two units of blood for a low hematocrit, did not have evidence of active bleeding, and was discharged on [**2181-8-1**] after a transjugular liver biopsy demonstrated biliary fibrosis/cirrhosis.
She was readmitted on [**2181-8-14**] with jaundice/anasarca and underwent diagnostic and therapeutic paracenteses with 4.5L of thin fluid removed, negative for SBP.
On initial examination she is resting comfortably with no immediate complaints.

On the floor, her condition deteriorated and her Acute Kidney Injury worsened, thought to be due to Hepatic Renal Syndrome (UNa<10).
Due to her worsening Cr, she was to undergo dialysis as a bridge to transplant, and thought not to be able to maintain pressures during hemodialysis so she had to go to the ICU to for CVVH.
[**8-28**]: lactulose back to q4, 2FFP, 1 cryo, bronch w/IP first attempt not tolerated [**2-15**] nausea, emesis, 2nd attempt at bronch successful- no purulent material sample from RML, a little blood; paracentesis w/body fellow.
Increasing FiO2 requirement overnight, intubated at 10PM for worsening respiratory status and ABG, and requiring neo gtt after intubation.
Likely hemorrhoidal bleed that wasn't stopping so started giving 2 u FFP and bleeding vessel suture ligated.
[**8-29**]: TTE revealed elevated PA pressures.
Bronch preformed and BAL from RML showed 2+PMN's, no orgs.
small left apical pneumothorax appreciated on CXR but did not appear to be clinically relevant.
Pressor requirement increased, levo/vaso were started given septic shock secondary to pneumonia, neo was weaned off.
[**8-30**]: Mrs. [**Known lastname 3175**] was deactivated on the liver transplant list due to overall illness secondary to liver failure in setting of pneumonia and septic shock with pressor requirement.
[**8-31**]: Repeat CXR secondary to asynchrony tachypnea on vent, relatively unchanged.
Given poor ventilation and oxygenation she was paralyzed with cisatricurium.
[**9-2**]: pressor requirement markedly increased and neosynephrine was added.
Given MSOF secondary to septic shock in setting of pneumonia and extremely poor prognosis a family meeting was held and she was made DNR/DNI.
