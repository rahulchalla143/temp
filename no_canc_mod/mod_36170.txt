No pleural effusions or pneumothorax is seen.
There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature, consistent with mild CHF.
IMPRESSION: 1) Mild CHF.
2) Retrocardiac opacity, which may represent pneumonia  CT abdomen/pelvis [**4-28**]: IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence for retroperitoneal or intraperitoneal hemorrhage.
2) Moderate amount of low-density fluid within the abdomen, which represents ascites, or more likely a peritoneal dialysis fluid.
4) Prominent lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum and right inguinal region of uncertain etiology and significance.
RLE U/S [**4-28**]: IMPRESSION: Conglomeration of lymph nodes in the right groin.
No evidence for deep vein thrombosis.
There is no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or hematoma.
CT head [**4-30**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
CXR [**4-30**]: The previously identified left lower lobe pneumonia has been improving.
There is continued mild congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly.
No pneumothorax is identified.
TTE [**4-30**]: There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with most likely  secondary to high output but aortic stenosis cannot be excluded.
No aortic  regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild  (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is  borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
No fracture or bone destruction.
No joint space narrowing.
Extensive vascular calcifications.
There is patchy bibasilar atelectasis, not significantly changed compared to the prior study.
No definite pneumonia is identified.
There is mild prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature, consistent with mild CHF/volume overload.
IMPRESSION: 1) Cardiomegaly with probable mild CHF/volume overload.
2) Bibasilar atelectasis.
Patchy opacity on the right base likely to rrepresent atelectasis, but early pneumonic infiltrate not excluded.
Right LE ultrasound showed no DVT or local abscess but demonstrated a possible A-V fistula and regional lymphadenopathy.
On admission, she was noted to have a pericardial rub on exam.
transferred to MICU, as below) and demonstrated slightly reduced EF (50-55%), symmetric LVH, 3+ TR, trivial pericardial effusion and no evidence of tamponade.
She became febrile to 101F.
A MICU evaluation was performed and in the setting of encephalopathy and hypotension, the pt was transferred to the MICU.
There she was volume resuscitated with intravenous fluids with response (mental status cleared, blood pressure improved).
A repeat CXR showed increased retrocardiac consolidation on the left.
had a head CT which was negative for acute intracranial pathology and an EEG given her history of seizures.
A repeat femoral ultrasound demonstrated no evidence of pseudoaneusym or hematoma.
complained of persistent RLE pain and weakness.
She denied all other complaints except chronic diarrhea which is unchanged in quality, frequency from usual.
continued to improve in that she remained afebrile, was saturating the mid 90's on room air and denied cough or shortness of breath.
RLE Pain:  Differential diagnosis included localized infection from recently placed right femoral line, diabetic amyotrophy, radiculopathy given h/o low back pain, degenerative joint disease, femoral fracture, and psoas abscess.
underwent plain films of the right hip and pelvis which ruled out a fracture or DJD.
She was slated to undergo an MRI of the pelvis and thigh to rule-out psoas abscess but the pt.
Her pain was controlled with prn acetaminophen and oxycodone.
She was also started on gabapentin for associated peripheral neuropathy.
Her glycemic control was erratic and related to her labile food intake.
She stated that her appetite was variable mostly due to long-standing nausea secondary to diabetic gastroparesis.
This resulted in more consistent oral intake at meal times and therefore more consistent glycemic control.
She was also started on prn [**Doctor First Name 130**] for uremic pruritis.
HTN: Following the episode of hypotension as described above, the pt was started on t.i.d.
Seizure disorder: EEG performed in the MICU was consistent encephalopathy and there were no epileptiform discharges noted.
She had no ictal events during her hospital stay.
Oxycodone HCl 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain not controlled with acetaminophen.
Fexofenadine HCl 60 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for pruritis.
