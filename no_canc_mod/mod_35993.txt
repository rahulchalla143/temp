Admission Date:  [**2148-10-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2148-10-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2092-11-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Penicillins / Morphine  Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 10493**] Chief Complaint: Neck pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion C6-C7 [**9-26**]  History of Present Illness: She has had chronic left neck/upper back pain radiating to her 4th and 5th fingers w/ "pins and needles" sensation in these fingers who was hospitalized in [**Month (only) 359**] for pain control and then on [**2152-9-26**] for ACDF of C6-C7.
Pain in the same distribution has been an ongoing issue and she represented on [**10-2**] with the same complaints.
MRI on [**10-4**] was performed (under anesthesia [**12-29**] to pain) which showed the spinal fusion at C6-7 without evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis or paraspinal abscess.
It did show degenerative changes, but no intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities or extrinsic spinal cord compression.
Chronic pain team was consulted at that time and recommended adding gabapentin and lidoderm patch to her oxycontin/oxycodone; she is not a candidate for injection given her recent surgery.
CTA chest did not show e/o PE, but did show e/o multilobar ground glass opacities.
Of note, she reports fevers to 101 at home postoperatively.
She reports that she awoke and had "lost her voice" w/ sx of sore throat.
Additionally of note, during a [**2142**] admission for back surgery, she had a multilobar staph pneumonia which was treated w/ levofloxacin and vanco.
Past Medical History: -Back pain -Hyperlipidemia -Hypertension -Tobacco use -Multiple back surgeries (x4 per pt) -Kidney stones -Seasonal allergies  Social History: She smokes 1ppd x 35+years, denies ETOH use or other drug use.
Family History: NC  Physical Exam: Temp m 99.1 c 98.6 BP 127/68 (116-132/63-85) Pulse 104 (91-107) Resp 16 O2 sat 93% 3L NC Gen - Alert, appears comfortable, no acute distress HEENT - anicteric, mucous membranes moist Neck - no [**Doctor First Name **], no cervical lymphadenopathy Chest - diffuse crackles CV - tachy regular, no murmurs apprecited Abd - Soft, nontender, nondistended, with normoactive bowel sounds Extr - No edema.
BOX [**Numeric Identifier 19430**] CHANTILLY, [**Numeric Identifier 19431**]  BAL: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Status post spinal fusion at C6-7 level without evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis or paraspinal abscess.
Degenerative changes at multiple levels as described above as seen on the previous MRI examinations.
No evidence of intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities or extrinsic spinal cord compression  CTA Chest: Right hilar lymphadenopathy and multifocal ground-glass opacities.
Other etiologies such as pulmonary edema are much less favored given the absence of pleural effusions.
Pulmonary hemorrhage remains a diagnostic possibility and correlation with recent coagulation parameters is recommended.
Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after establishing intravenous access.
There were no immediate complications.
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided double-lumen PICC line placement via the left basilic venous approach.
Low lung volumes are again noted.
There is a persistent right basilar opacity, likely reflects underlying atelectasis and/or pneumonia.
Cervical spinal fusion hardware is again seen.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 55yo woman w/ h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia, chronic back and neck pain on narcotics s/p ACDF C6-7 on [**9-26**] who is now being transferred to medicine for hypoxia and probable multilobar pneumonia.
A CTA showed no PE but multi-lobar ground glass opacities.
Pt triggered [**10-7**] at 6 am for hypoxia to 60s on room air which returned to the 90s on [**Month/Year (2) 597**].
However, on the floor, the pt shortly developed a fever to 101.9, became tachycardic to 140s, satting in the low 90s on 10L high flow mask with abg 7.44/40/62.
A CXR showed a worsening RLL opacity.
Given persistent temp spikes >101 pt's levofloxacin was changed to aztreonam/azithromycin (PCN allergy).
Pt was also given the presumptive diagnosis of BOOP and started on solumedrol.
All microbiological studies to date have yielded no organisms but may have been complicated by antibiotic usage.
At the time of discharge, she was ambulatory off O2 with no significant desaturations.
# Leukocytosis: Was initially elevated in the setting of possible infection but trended down from ~24 to 12.9 with treatment.
However, upon initiation of steroid treatment, they immediately rose again, likely due to demargination.
# Left neck pain: The chronic pain team was consulted and recommended a regimen of oxycontin, oxycodone prn, neurontin, and lidoderm patch which made her pain much more tolerable.
However, she felt that the main cause of her pain remained unadressed.
# Hyperglycemia: No reported h/o DM or impaired glucose tolerance and likely increased in the setting of steroids.
# Hypertension: Continued oh her home dose toprol XL # Hyperlipidemia: Continued on her home dose statin.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*1*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: VNA of [**Location (un) 270**]-East & Visiting Nurse Hospice  Discharge Diagnosis: Multifocal pneumonia of unknown organism Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia Chronic left shoulder pain of unknown etiology.
However, you then developed a significant pneumonia for which you were treated with antibiotics.
You may also have a condition called bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, or BOOP for short.
This is an inflammatory condition of the lungs that resembles pneumonia but is treated with steroids.
Your left shoulder pain was still present on this admission.
In conjunction with the pain service here, we found a pain control regimen that appears to control your pain relatively well.
An MRI of your neck showed no further abnormality.
Keep wound(s) clean and dry / No tub baths or pools for two weeks from your date of surgery ??????
If you have steri-strips in place ??????
No pulling up, lifting> 10 lbs., excessive bending or twisting ??????
Have a family member check your incision daily for signs of infection ??????
If you are required to wear one, wear cervical collar or back brace as instructed ??????
Take pain medication as instructed; you may find it best if taken in the a.m. when you wake for morning stiffness and before bed for sleeping discomfort ??????
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber as pain medicine (narcotics) can cause constipation ??????
Pain that is continually increasing or not relieved by pain medicine ??????
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, drainage ??????
