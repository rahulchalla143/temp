Admission Date:  [**2114-3-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2114-3-19**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Prednisone / Isordil / Ace Inhibitors  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 29250**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with history of CHF and previous admissions for acute heart failure who presents with acute onset dyspnea, without any chest pain.
He has had multiple admissions to [**Hospital1 18**], [**Hospital1 882**], and [**Hospital 100**] rehab within past several months for CHF, C. difficile, and GI bleeding, the latter two necessitating diuretic dose reduction with resultant CHF exacerbations.
He denied any chest pain associated with this.
EMS was called and administered 50mg IV furosemide on initial evaluation and placed on non-rebreather for decreased oxygen saturation.
Patient was then brought to the emergency room, where he was noted to also be hypertensive to 225/110.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p at least 2 MIs per patient, first at age 58 CHF with past hospital admissions for this Chronic Kidney Disease DM II COPD - Smoked 4ppd for 50 years, on 2 litres Home O2 Peptic Ulcer Disease s/p rx for H.pylori HTN h/o Testicular cancer h/o pancreatitis s/p cholecystectomy s/p L parotidectomy complicated by facial nerve paralysis   Social History: no current alcohol/tobacco, lives with wife but most recently from STR.
He smoked tobacco for about 50 years at two to four packs per day and quit in [**2080**] after his first myocardial infarction.
Diffuse opacification of the right hemithorax with haziness of the pulmonary vascular markings is compatible with pulmonary edema.
Similar findings are seen within the left lung, but not as severe in extent, compatible with asymmetric edema.
Small pleural effusions are likely present.
The aorta demonstrates calcifications at its arch.
No pneumothorax.
Chest x-ray [**2114-3-18**]: FINDINGS: Compared to the prior study, there are worsening pleural effusions bilaterally, but right more so than left.
No evidence for progressive distention of the pulmonary vessels.
A stable well-circumscribed 2 cm mass is seen right lower lobe which has been seen back to a CT scan of [**2112**].
Small shrunken kidneys, more so on the right, with cortical thinning and increased echogenicity consistent with chronic kidney disease.
Multiple renal cysts as previously demonstrated.
Very limited Doppler examination due to patient's inability to hold breath.
Brief Hospital Course: 1) Acute on chronic systolic CHF - Thought secondary to worse hypertension (presented with blood pressure 225/110).
Patient transiently required nitroglycerin drip and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation with BiPAP but this had been titrated off by the time patient arrived in the CCU.
Patient was ruled out for MI with serial cardiac enzymes, telemetry and EKG.
Likely ischemic cardiomyopathy given history of MI, no coronary angiographies per our records, perhaps due to patients advanced chronic renal failure.
This exacerbation likely precipitated by uncontrolled hypertension and flash pulmonary oedema.
2) Hypertension - Given dramatic elevation of blood pressure, patient required nitroglycerin gtt temporarily.
He was started on Isordil in addition to his other anti-hypertensives, and his blood pressure improved to systolic of 150s.
3) Coronary artery disease - patient with previous history of two MIs.
5) COPD: Extensive smoking history, though no documented obstructive disease by PFTs.
Dyspnea secondary to CHF as above, but can consider inhalers in addition if needed.
7) Chronic Renal insufficiency: Patient with admission Cr of 3.8 which appears to be his baseline.
Has refused dialysis in the past, but potassium was stable during this admission and there were no signs of uremia.
8) C. difficile colitis - Patient continued his Vancomycin taper and metronidazole which he was receiving at home, with plan to complete this course on [**2114-3-20**].
Vancomycin 125 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q6H (every 6 hours) for 2 days: To complete last day on [**2114-3-20**], for C. difficile.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure.
Secondary diagnoses: Chronic renal failure Diabetes mellitus   Discharge Condition: Stable, on 2 litres of oxygen which is same amount patient uses at home.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet  You were admitted for shortness of breath due to heart failure.
You tolerated the Isosorbide dinitrate (Isordil) without adverse effects.
