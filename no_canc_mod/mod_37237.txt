HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST  INDICATION: 78-year-old woman transferred from outside hospital status post fall on the face, with facial abrasions, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
FINDINGS: There are a few small foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage layering within sulci near the vertex on the left, as well as a small focus in the right interhemispheric fissure.
There is no edema, mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
Hypodensities in the basal ganglia bilaterally likely represent chronic lacunar infarctions.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.
Bone windows demonstrated bilateral fractures of the nasal bone and fracture of the nasal septum.
There is a radiopaque foreign body in the soft tissues of the nose on the right.
Small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage near the vertex.
Bilateral nasal bone and nasal septum fracture.

There are no new foci of hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
IMPRESSION: No significant change in small subarachnoid hemorrhage.
