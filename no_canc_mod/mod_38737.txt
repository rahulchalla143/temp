She was found to have L sided neglect.
NCHCT was negative for acute process and she was admitted for hyponatremia.
Subsequent MRI showed a R sided thalamic stroke.
She was not noted to have any concern for seizure activity at that time.
She presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**8-27**] after she was found to be drooling, with worsening L facial droop and LUE tremor.
She had no LOC prior to presentation.
Discharge summary states MRI with contrast showed acute/subacute infarct of R hemisphere involving entire PCA territory and posterior aspect of the MCA territory, moderate diffuse atrophy and periventricular gliosis.
Neurology was consulted and felt the worsening of her symptoms may have been due to recrudescence in the setting of an infection.
Multiple EEG studies were performed which were concerning for continued epileptiform focus in the R occipital lobe and epilepsy partialis continua.
She was started on Keppra and Valproic Acid that she had been prescribed for bipolar disorder was titrated up.
She was found to be C. diff toxin positive at the OSH after it was checked for persistent diarrhea and was started on metronidazole, start date unknown.
The patient was reported to have received heparin at [**Hospital **] Hospital, presumably beginning around [**8-15**] for DVT prophylaxis.
She was unable to have NG placed for dysphagia and eventually had a PEG placed for this reason without complication.
She apparently had evidence of gastritis on EGD in the setting of PEG placement.
was hypotensive and tachycardic, was transferred to ICU for closer monitoring.
She had a heparin-dependent PICC placed in the RUE for ?TPN and was subsequently noted to have asymmetric UE swelling, R>L.
LENI showed no DVT in the RUE, but did reveal superficial basilic vein thrombosis.
She was also noted to have sporadic bruising and cyanosis in the extremities in the 2 days leading up to transfer.
[**Hospital1 18**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] for transfer for possible plasmapheresis and the patient was accepted to the ICU.
On the floor, the patient has no specific complaints and wants to know what she is going to watch on television tonight.

Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common causes.
Although encephalopathies may obscure focal findings, there was focal slowing on this EEG, suggesting a focal subcortical dysfunction or possibly lesion in the right posterior quadrant.
There were frequent focal sharp waves and spikes in the same area, raising the possibility of an area of focal epileptogenesis, but no actual seizures were recorded.
Bibasilar atelectasis with probable small left effusion.
[**9-12**] Carotid duplex ultrasound: FINDINGS: Bilateral mildly calcified atherosclerotic plaques are seen at the carotid bulbs and proximal internal carotid arteries.
The peak systolic velocity in the right internal carotid artery ranges from 40 to 55 cm/sec and in the left internal carotid artery from 42 to 44 cm/sec.
The peak systolic velocity in the right common carotid artery is 44 cm/sec and left common carotid artery is 60 cm/sec.
Bilateral external carotid arteries are patent.
There is antegrade flow in bilateral vertebral arteries.
IMPRESSION: Less than 40% stenosis in bilateral carotid arteries.
[**9-12**]: Echo No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**12-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism seen.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[**9-14**]: right upper extremity DVT scan: -clot noted in basilic vein(prelim read)   Brief Hospital Course: 78F with HTN, bipolar disorder, recent CVA with residual L hemiparesis and unclear seizure disorder who is transferred for possible plasmapheresis in the setting of thrombocytopenia believed to be heparin-induced.
Patient started on agatroban anticoagulation and all heparin exposure was stopped, including removal of previous PICC and replacement with non-heparin dependent PICC.
However, patient developed bleeding day after admission around PICC, hematuria, and had blood in her stools, and argatroban gtt was held.
TTP was thought to be unlikely due to lack of shisctocytes on blood smear and no evidence of hemolysis.
# History of recent cva: Patient with recent right thalamic stroke treated at OSH, followed by right PCA/MCA infarcts and apparent seizure disorder.
Echo was neg for embolic source and carotid ultrasound showed 40% stenosis.
EEG showed general slowing with some sharp spikes, but no clear seizure activity.
# C. diff colitis: Started treatment 9/25 per osh medication administration record.
HER MEDICATION NEEDS WILL NEED TO BE READRESSED AFTER ACUTE REHAB COMPLETED OR IF SYMPTOMS RECUR.
5. fondaparinux 7.5 mg/0.6 mL Syringe Sig: 7.5 mg Subcutaneous once a day: Will need treatment for approximately 3 months for right arm DVT.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Thrombocytopenia Stroke Seizure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You had a recent stroke and to prevent blood clots you were put on heparin.
