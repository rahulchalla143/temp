History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 110070**] is a 60M with history of advanced ALS, chronic trach/mechanical ventilation/PEG, DVT/PE on warfarin who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] now with concern for acute cholecystitis and need for ERCP.
Patient initially admitted to [**Hospital1 392**] after presenting with fevers and jaundice.
Over past 10 days has noticed him to becoming increasingly more jaundice associated with darker colored urine and [**Male First Name (un) 1658**] colored stools.
CT scan and RUQ at OSH revealed dilated intrahepatic biliary ducts.
He has a chronic trach and is on mechanical ventilation, and also has a PEG through which he receives nutrition and meds.
He was notably jaundice on exam and was complaining of some abominal pain with palpation but difficult to assess exactly where in his abdomen.

Imaging RUQ U/S [**2190-5-27**] (prelim read) Cholelithiasis and mild gallbladder wall edema in a minimally distended gallbladder.
Additionally, there is mild prominence of the intrahepatic ducts with a top-normal CBD.
These findings are more suggestive of a chronic cholecystitis as opposed to an acute cholecystitis.
Furthermore, the liver demonstrates areas of increased echogenicity and hepatitis must be excluded clinically.
Multiple hepatic cysts and granulomas incidentally noted.
ERCP [**2190-5-28**]: Procedures: Multiple balloon sweeps were performed and no sludge or stone were extracted.A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Cytology samples were obtained for histology using a brush in the narrowing at the bifurcation of the bile duct.
Impression: The tip of a G tube was noted to be in place in the stomach Major papilla had a lacerated appearance suggestive of recent passage of stone.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
A small area of narrowing was noted at the level of the bifurcation of the CBD.
Rest of the biliary tree appeared unremarkable with no filling defects.
Cytology samples were obtained for histology using a brush in the narrowing at the bifurcation of the bile duct.
Otherwise will need repeat ERCP in 3 months for stent pull and evaluation of stricture   LABS PENDING AT TIME OF DISCHARGE: - Cytology from ERCP   Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION: 60yM with PMH significant for ALS who is vent and PEG tube dependent who initially presented to OSH w/ fever, jaundice, abdominal discomfort consistent with ascending cholangitis.
# Ascending Cholangitis - On admission patient w/ WBC 20,000, fever, tachycardia with elevated cholestatic LFT concerning for cholangitis.
He was started on antibiotics and underwent ERCP and was found to have evidence of recent CBD stone passage as well as a stricture at bifurcation.
Cytology samples were obtained for histology using a brush in the narrowing at the bifurcation of the bile duct.
Otherwise will need repeat ERCP in 3 months for stent pull and evaluation of stricture .
# History of DVT/PE - pt on warfarin chronically for history of DVT/PE.
IVC filter present.

Patient given Vit K / FFP for procedure to reverse.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # Elevated TSH ??????
the patient has a history of  hypothyroidism although he is not on levothyroxine (confirmed w/ PCP) also with history of elevated TSH (up to 20) in critical illness.
- PCP should recheck thyroid studies in 4 weeks following acute illness .
