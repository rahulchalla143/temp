Incompletely assessed pelvic fractures including a right sacral body and [**Doctor First Name 362**] fracture extending into at least one of the right neural foramina.
[**9-4**] KUB Two AP views of the abdomen demonstrate substantially dilated bowel loops, both colon and small bowel that most likely consistent with ileus but attention on the subsequent studies is required to exclude the possibility of obstruction.
No definitive free air is seen.
Pt seen at OSH, then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as a trauma basic.
On arrival, Mr. [**Known lastname **] complained of pain to his back and hips, but denied numbness/tingling.
In the ED no intra-abd, intracranial, or intrathoracic injuries were identified; he was seen and evaluated by the ortho trauma and neuro-spine services.
Injuries: T11, L2 fracture R sacral alar fracture Right superior/inferior pubic rami fracture R 9th rib fx  [**8-30**]: Admitted to TSICU for Q2hr neuro checks, on log roll precautions without any neurologic deficits.
Pain controlled with IV dilaudid.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued on logroll precautions, awaiting operative fixation of L2 fracture with spine.
Left intubated overnight for OR with ortho trauma on [**9-2**].
[**9-2**]: OR with ortho trauma for attempted SI fixation, but the procedure was aborted secondary to overlying bowel gas.
On the same day, the patient was complaining of nausea and vomiting.
A KUB was obtained, showing dilated loops of bowel, likely due to an ileus.
His pain was initially managed with a dilaudid PCA and then transitioned to oral narcotic and non-narcotic analgesics once taking a full diet.
As his ambulation and mobilization increased over the subsequent days, pain management had been an issue.
His pain is well controlled on the current regimen.
He has been moving his bowels and urinating without issue.
HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid) 2-4 mg PO Q3H:PRN pain   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: T11 compression fracture L2 fracture Superior/inferior pubic rami fractures Right sacral ala fracture Right 9th rib fracture   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Upon radiological evaluation, you were found to have the injuries as noted below under "Final Diagnosis".
You also had your pelvic fracture repaired with Orthopedics on [**9-6**].
As you progress over the next days to weeks, the goal is to take less narcotics and ease your pain with non-narcotic analgesics, such as Tylenol.
