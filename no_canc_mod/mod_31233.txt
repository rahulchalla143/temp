Sepsis protocol initiated initially but hypotension quickly resolved after hemodialysis stopped and fluid boluses given.
Patient denied any chest pain.
A head CT was negative for any acute process.
Initially treated for UTI w/ Levoquin as admission u/a w/ moderate leukocyte esterase and > 50 bacteria.
Urine cx negative except for yeast so stopped anitbiotics after short course.
Given hx of MRSA sepsis, initially covered with broad spectrum antibiotics, Vancomycin for gram positive coverage, Levofloxacin for gram negative coverage.
Has been afebrile with normal wbc during admission.
It appears that hypotension secondary to UTI or potentially hemodialysis.
