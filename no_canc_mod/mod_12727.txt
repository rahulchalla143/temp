EKG 08/[**0-0-**]: Sinus rhythm and occasional atrial ectopy.
Left anterior fascicular block.
Right bundle-branch block.
Xray femur/pelvis, right [**2119-9-12**]: Minimally displaced intertrochanteric fracture of the proximal right femur.
Prominent multilevel degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine .
There is mild aortic valve stenosis  (area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve  leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial  mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic  hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild valvular aortic stenosis.
At least moderate pulmonary hypertension with normal right ventricular systolic function.
[**2119-9-26**] Chest xray: FINDINGS:  Portable upright AP chest radiograph shows no significant radiographic change in bibasilar consolidation over the past five days.
Cardiac and mediastinal contours including slightly hazy fullness in perihilar vasculature are unchanged.

Discharge labs [**2119-10-3**] 142 / 108 / 21    AGap=11 -----------------  96 4.1 / 27 / 1.2  Source: Line-PICC  WBC 13.8  HCT 25.3 PLT 452  Brief Hospital Course: Assessement/Plan: [**Age over 90 **] yo blind, Russsian speaking F with HTN and significant hx for smoking was admitted s/p mechanical fall, suffered a right hip fracture and underwent right hip [**Age over 90 24785**].
She tolerated the procedure well requiring 2U blood transfusion, however post op course was complicated by confusion, agitation as well as pneumonia/hypoxia requiring transfer to the ICU.
In the setting of hypoxia/pneumonia she also went into atrial fibrillation, which has since resolved.
Was oxygenated using NRB, did not require Bipap or intubation.
# R hip fracture s/p [**Age over 90 24785**]- R hip incision site was monitored for signs of infection; did not have drainage or erythema during duration of hospitalization.
She was continued on renally dosed Lovenox throughout hospitalization for prevention of DVT in setting of hip fracture.
Lovenox will be stopped on [**2119-10-10**] to complete 4 week post fracture course.
# MICU course: On [**2119-9-21**], POD #9 [**Name (NI) 24785**], pt was noted to be more somnolent with an O2 saturation of 82% on RA, she had increased O2 requirement up to NRB facemask.
She did not require intubation, however she developed atrial fibrillation which was rate controlled with Diltiazem.
Her therapy for pneumonia was also continued at this time.
# Aspiration pneumonia/hospital acquired: Sputum grew out gram negative rods postop and she was started on Levaquin for a 7day course.
However, she decompensated with hypoxia requiring transfer to the unit before the therapy was completed.
Given her extensive smoking hx nebulizers were administered and will be continued until post pneumonia wheezing resolves.
She continued to improve as evidence by the decline of leukocytosis, as well as improvement in her oxygen saturation.
# Agitation/delirium: Progressively worsened after hip surgery in the setting of blindness as well as being Russian speaking only.
At time of discharge, acute agitation resolved and she was more oriented and according to family close to her baseline.
There was no evidence of active bleeding at any time.
# Atrial fibrillation: Developed after [**Hospital **] transfer to the MICU.
Most likely in the setting of pneumonia/hypoxia and s/p surgery.
EKG did not show evidence of ischemia.
# Acute renal failure: Unsure of pt's baseline, however admitted with Cr 1.6.
Worsened slightly in light of surgery, hypovolemia, and infection however continued to improve during admission.
# Hypertension: Pt was initially on Lisinopril 40mg on admission, however, we continued Diltiazem, also for rate control.
At time of discharge urinary retention resolved however continued to have episodes of incontinence.
Retention ruled out by bladder scan and no evidence of UTI on urinalysis.
Possible secondary to limited mobility.
# Communication: With son, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 39904**] (cell), [**Telephone/Fax (1) 39905**] (home), or his wife [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 39906**].
Of note, the patient is BLIND and speaks RUSSIAN.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 hours) as needed for Insomia.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 2558**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Right hip fracture Post operative anemia Atrial Fibrillation Pneumonia .
Secondary Diagnoses: Chronic Renal Insufficiency Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after your right hip fracture.
You also developed pneumonia and a fast heart rate (atrial fibrillation) while in hospital.
In addition we stopped the lisinopril that you have been taking for your blood pressure.
