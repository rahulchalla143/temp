She has a history of chest and abdominal pain; workup revealed a very large diaphragmatic hernia with herniation of the transverse colon and the stomach into above the right chest.

Chest xray showed significant hemidiaphragm on R side which was consistent with surgical repair but diminished her ventilatory capacity; the patient was given aggressive suctioning and pulmonary toilet.
Rapid AF:  On postoperative day one ([**8-25**]) she was found to be in a rapid afib with rates in 130 - 140.
She did not become hypotensive throughout this time.
An echocardiogram was performed that revealed left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%); the mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened and trace mitral regurgitation was present.
Delerium Tremens:  The etiology of her rapid atrial fibrillation is most likely postoperative alcohol withdrawal.
Around the time she developed rapid AF she was noted to be extremely agitated, and having tremors, sweating, visual and auditory (talking to her dead sister) hallucinations, anxious, restless, and disoriented consistent with Delerium Tremens.
A geriatrics consult was called for management of the delerium tremens.
The patient remained delerious for nearly a week; her ativan was slowly tapered to her home dose of 0.5 mg qAM and 1.0 mg QHS.
She eventually became oriented, was able to tolerate PO, and ambulate well without assistance.
Her foley catheter was removed and she urinated without difficulty.
She does have a history of incontinence and this continued but she had no post-void residuals.
The patient received a non-contrast CT scan of the head, that revealed no acute abnormality but global parenchymal atropy most significant in the frontal lobes, consistent with her known long history of alcohol use.
They also noted b/l LE muscle weakness consistent with a chronic myelopathy and likely secondary to cervical spondylosis.
