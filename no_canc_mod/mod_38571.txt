The area of hemorrhage is demonstrated as a hyperdense heterogeneous area, effacement of the sulci, and midline shifting is also detected with approximately 4.4 mm of midline shifting to the right.
The perimesencephalic cisterns are patent without evidence of uncal herniation.
Increase in the pattern of vasogenic edema surrounding the hemorrhagic area as well as effacement of the left lateral ventricle.
The core of the hematoma measures approximately 2.9 x 5.3 cm at the level of the left temporal lobe and insula.
IMPRESSION: Large hemorrhagic transformation on a prior ischemic area involving the left MCA vascular territory, associated with vasogenic edema, effacement of the sulci, and midline shifting as described above.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2170-2-15**] 10:22 AM FINDINGS: Again identified is a hemorrhagic infarction of the left middle cerebral artery territory and associated vasogenic edema.
There is no new hemorrhage identified.
There is no change in appearance of effacement of sulci or increase in the degree of midline shift.
IMPRESSION: Large left MCA territory hemorrhage, with no significant change in edema or midline shift.
Brief Hospital Course: 70 yo RH female with ho HTN, DMII, Afib  recently admitted to Stroke Service at [**Hospital1 18**] for left MCA infarct and started on Coumadin now presents with large ICH in infarction site.
CT on admission revealed hematoma measuring approximately 2.9 x 5.3 cm at level of temporal lobe and insula compressing the left lateral vent with 4-5 mm midline shift.
She was continued on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis.
Interval CT scan did not reveal worsening of the hemorrhage or midline shift.
2) Lower extremity cellulitis and Enterococcus bacteremia: She completed her 4-week course of ampicillin and gentamicin on [**2-21**] and her PICC Line should be discontinued.
In hospital there were no signs of LE erythema, edema or tenderness.
Her exam at discharge: global aphasia (mute but mouthing, inconsistently follows basic commands), R facial droop and hemiparesis with RUE plegia and triple flexious response to noxious stim of RLE, R upgoing plantar response, L-sided strength full.
She was hypertensive and hyperglycemic so her antihypertensives (Lisinopril initially 20 but decreased to 10 due to BP dip, Metoprolol 37.5 TID, Lasix 40) and Metformin were restarted.
We recommend that she be restarted on her Coumadin 14 days after the hemorrhage which occurred [**2-14**], without Heparin bridge, but this should be done at conservative doses and with frequent INR monitoring.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: hemorrhagic conversion of recent L MCA ischemic stroke in the context of supratherapeutic INR   Discharge Condition: neurologically stable, globally aphasic, R hemiparesis   Discharge Instructions: You have had bleeding in the area of your previous stroke, in the setting of a very high INR.
Please call your Primary Care Physician or present to the nearest Emergency Department if you have any worsening of your symptoms or new concerning symptoms.
