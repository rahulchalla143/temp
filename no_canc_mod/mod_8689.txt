The patient is being transitioned to HD due to continually worsening renal function.
By report, the patient has not had his usual daily bowel movements for 3 days and had missed a scheduled lab check on the day of presentation due to a major snowstorm that was blanketing the [**Location (un) 86**] metropolitan area at the time.
The patient complained of low back pain throughout the day.
Transcutaneous pacer pads were used, but due to concern of low blood pressure, no sedation was given, and shocks were discontinued when they did not capture.
On arrival to the floor, the patient was found to be minimally responsive with labored breathing.
With absent pulse, chest compressions were intiated.
He was difficult to ventilate initially until it was recognized that he had a right mainstem bronchus intubation; his ETT was pulled back and his oxygenation improved.
He had a CT scan of his abdomen for which a preliminary read suggested colitis and pancreatitis without contrast extravasation into the peritoneum.

Gallbladder enhancement and common bile duct enhancement could also be related to pancreatitis.
Large third duodenum diverticulum.
Nonobstructive right vesicoureteral junction ureterolithiasis.

MICU/CCU Course according to problem: # Hypotension: Mr [**Known lastname **] was hypotensive in the CCU, even after his hyperkalemia and bradycardia were corrected.
He had a high lactate.
His CT scan included findings of possible pancreatitis (supported by high pancreatic enzymes) and colitis (which might be source of high but now lower lactate).
In the MICU: * hypotension resolved [**12-2**]-> pt hypertensive * restarted [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 3782**] [**Last Name (un) **] and hydralazine, imdur * persistent hypertension, was started on nitro gtt [**12-4**].
# Bradycardia: Mr [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU from [**Hospital3 **] originally because of bradycardia refractory to transcutaneous pacing attempts.
The bradycardia was in the setting of severe hyperkalemia, and although he first had a PEA cardiac arrest requiring resuscitation, his arrythmias resolved after correction of potassium in the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU.
Agree with CCU assessment that potassium level is likely source of his original bradycardia and likely his syncopal and pre-syncopal events described by his family.
* resolved [**12-2**], no new episodes in the MICU; continued to hold nodal blockers .
Presented with K of 7.3, and likely etiology of patients arrythmia, which had corrected with short term interventions.
?s symptoms of dizziness, nausea, and vomiting likely secondary to uremia/hyperkalemia given timing, though underlying infection is a possibility.
# CKD: Secondary to DM/HTN and being transitioned to HD with ESRD.
* [**12-4**] HCT drop in setting of self discontinuation of fem line (patient pulled out) - CT abd/pelvis negative for intra or retroperitoneal bleed, received 2 units of PRBCs.
Anemia stable .
# Respiratory Distress: Patient with agonal breathing on presentation, poor oxygenation with large A-a gradient.
Intubated in setting of PEA arrest.
Patient had glucose of 606 in CCU with consistent hyperglycemia; may be secondary to pancreatic injury.
# Leukocytosis: Elevated to 17, unclear etiology.
Patient developed low grade fever (T max 100.2).
Patient with history of gout, no erythema or warmness on exam, but uric acid elevated to 8.8.
Patient was afebrile > 48hr with negative cultures and decreasing leukocytosis prior to discharge.
# Hypertension : Moderately well-controlled 130-40s.
Avoiding increasing nodal blockade in the setting of recent bradycardia.
# Knee pain: Symptoms have improved.
Right knee without warmth, erythema or tenderness.
Avoid any NSAID treatment for gout due to unstable renal function.
Knee film demonstrated no abnormalities.
Pain improved prior to discharge.
No other evidence of bleeding.
Chronic anemia most likely due to renal disease.
# Enterococcus UTI: Treated with Ampicillin for 7 day course.
# CKD: Acute elevation in creatinine most likely ATN related to hypovolemia.
Chronic renal disease secondary to DM/HTN.
Mild creatinine increase could have been due to ibuprofen dose 12/28 for ?
# PEA Arrest: Likely related to hyperkalemia, presumably from ESRD.
Has recovered very well with no obvious morbidity.
Underlying rhythm was a junctional bradycardia.

Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PEA arrest Bradycardia Acute on chronic renal failure requiring emergent dialysis Hyperkalemia Urinary tract infection Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Good, ambulating.
During your hospital stay you had a cardiac arrest, and was consequently intubated and transferred to the medical ICU.
You were found to have renal failure and high potassium and was consequently started on dialysis.
Your renal failure improved and you no longer required dialysis.
You were treated for a urinary tract infection.
Return to the ER if you experience dizziness, passing out, chest pain, difficulty breathing, fever, chills or any other concerning symptoms.
