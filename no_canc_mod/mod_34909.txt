The lobar hemorrhage with blood in the immediately overlying subarachnoid space, as well as early development of blood/fluid levels (in the absence of history of anticoagulation) is strongly suggestive of underlying cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
No CTA "spot sign" to suggest increased risk of hematoma expansion, with no evidence of either underlying vascular anomaly or mass.
Essentially unremarkable circle of [**Location (un) 431**], with incidentally noted PICA-termination of a congenitally hypoplastic right vertebral artery.
Overall appearance of the acute right parietovertex parenchymal hematoma, including prominent involvement of the overlying subarachnoid space and early blood/fluid level (in the absence of history of anticoagulation) is highly suggestive of underlying cerebral amyloid angiopathy, despite the lack of evidence of "microbleed" elsewhere.
Prominent rim enhancement, including a few more "nodular" foci but no evidence of central enhancement; this appearance may be seen with organizing hematoma and does not specifically indicate an underlying neoplastic process.
No pathologic focus of enhancement, elsewhere.
Expected postsurgical appearance s/p right parietal lesion resection.
New mild vasogenic edema anterior to the surgical cavity without significant mass effect.
Small focus of contrast enhancement medial to the superior aspect of the blood-failed right parietal surgical cavity.
Small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage adjacent to the surgical cavity, with associated sulcal contrast enhancement.
Small acute infarction along the margins of the surgical cavity.
Slightly increased vasogenic edema along the surgical cavity compared to the preoperative exam, without ventricular effacement or shift of midline structures.
She was admitted to the ICU and a CTA was obtained to r/o underlying AVM or elsion.
She subsequently underwent an MRI scan of her Brain to assess for mass and it was felt that there was an underlying lesion.

Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
You have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with laboratory blood drawing in one week.
If you are being sent home on steroid medication, make sure you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec, Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach irritation.
Make sure to take your steroid medication with meals, or a glass of milk.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: increasing redness, increased swelling, increased tenderness, or drainage.
