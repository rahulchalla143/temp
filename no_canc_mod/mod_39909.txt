4.Closure of abdominal incision.
He had a colonoscopy in [**2188-8-23**] which showed moderate diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and was otherwise normal.
He is now having recurrent attacks of left lower quadrant pain and left lower back pain every 6-8 months.
He is currently asymptomatic and he  presents for laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy for recurrent diverticulitis.
Past Medical History: diverticulitis x3 ([**8-29**], [**1-30**], [**1-1**]), Hypertension Hyperlipidimia  Social History: Supportive family, works full time.
Colonic segment with multiple diverticuli and focus of associated acute and chronic inflammation.
Four lymph nodes with no diagnostic abnormalities recognized.
Left pleural effusion with retrocardiac opacification most likely consistent with atelectasis, though superimposed pneumonia can certainly not be excluded in the presence of clinical symptom of fever.
Mild prominence of pulmonary vessels raises the possibility of overhydration.
CT [**3-2**]: Moderate intraperitoneal air, complex-appearing fluid along Morison's pouch and in the right paracolic gutter, and a small loculation of air contiguous with the free fluid which is just superior to the sigmoid anastomosis.
These findings raise suspicion for anastomotic breakdown or leak, although enteric contrast has not reached the anastomosis at the time of the scan.
CT [**3-2**]: Increased attenuation in extraluminal pelvic fluid in post rectal contrast scan, indicating active rectal contrast extravasation.
There is abnormal septal motion/position suggestive of an IVCD.

No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
