Pulmonary:  Around [**3-14**] the patient was noted to have slow onset progressive desaturation on room air and was requiring 2 liters of oxygen by the end of the day on [**3-14**] and was noted to be significantly more hypoxic on ambulation with O2 sats dropping to the mid 80s.
Concurrent with this the patient was noted to have a drop in her hematocrit from a baseline of around 30 to 25.5 on [**3-14**] and by the following day her oxygen saturation continued to drop requiring increasing amounts of oxygen.
Chest x-ray was concerning for interstitial edema consistent with congestive heart failure and the patient was diuresed with intravenous Lasix and was transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells as her hematocrit had dropped to 25.
Recommendation was made to obtain a CT of the chest with intravenous contrast, which was revealing for diffuse interstitial edema including the alveoli and recommendation was made to proceed with bronchoscopy.
As the patient was recently weaned from steroids the thinking was that this could possibly represent PCP given [**Name Initial (PRE) **] relative immunosuppressed state and Bactrim was started as empiric therapy.
Bronchoscopy was postponed as the patient developed a bradyarrhythmia with frequent pauses as well as rates in the 30s and 40s.
By [**3-19**] oxygen requirement had increased to 100% FIO2 on a nonrebreather with sats being maintained in the mid 90% range.
An induced sputum was sent by respiratory therapy for a PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 2347**], later that day the patient's oxygenation continued to worsen, began to develop mental status changes.
The following day bronchoscopy was performed, which showed evidence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
No evidence of pus or other infectious process.
No evidence of PCP.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] evidence of fungal infections.
The antibiotics were discontinued and the patient was started on pulse dose steroids for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
Appearance on chest x-ray appeared to be that of a resolving diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
By [**3-25**] the patient's volume status due to her acute renal failure began to effect oxygenation with increasing PEEP as well as FIO2 requirement.
By [**3-27**] there was evidence of ongoing diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with increasing bloody secretions draining from the ET tube as well as drop in hematocrit.
Oxygen requirement continued to increase.
Data did support the use of plasmaphoresis in diffuse alveolar hemorrhage secondary to scleroderma is unfortunately scant, however, given the patient's critical illness it was felt that a trial of plasmaphoresis would be worthwhile.
Over the course of the next five days the patient's oxygenation significantly improved with stabilization of the hematocrit and FIO2 weaned down to .45 as well as a decrease of the PEEP down to 5.
On [**4-2**] the patient's oxygen requirement began to climb with an increase in PEEP as well as FIO2 with some evidence of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage could once again be occurring given the drop in hematocrit and appearance on chest x-ray.
Bronchoscopy was performed once again, which showed evidence of ongoing diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
No clear evidence of an infectious process as contributing to this current worsening as gram stain as well as cultures were negative for any growth of organisms.
Given the recurrence of these findings despite treatment with pulse dose steroids as well as plasmaphoresis, it was felt that plasmaphoresis would be of limited utility and would be continued on a q.o.d.
basis and the pulse dose steroids would be reduced once again to baseline of 100 mg of Solu-Medrol q 8 hours.
By [**4-5**] the patient's pulmonary status continued to worsen with an oxygen requirement now of 100% FIO2 with 17 of PEEP.
On [**4-6**] this was done with the family all present and within several minutes of extubation the patient became apneic and expired.
Atrial fibrillation:  The patient continued to be in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation throughout her hospital stay on both the floor as well as in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
She was initially started on a Diltiazem drip, which was discontinued due to bradycardia during the initial stay in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
However, it was restarted due to rapid atrial fibrillation with rates as high as 140s and 150s with adequate rate control achieved with about 10 to 15 mg intravenous q hour of Diltiazem.
Renal failure:  Initially the etiology of the renal failure was unclear.
It was felt that it was likely due to the aggresive diuresis and reducing volume overload that was evident on chest x-ray.
It was evident that the patient had mild pulmonary hypertension with systolic PA pressures in the 50 to 60 range with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of approximately 25 giving evidence that the etiology of the renal failure was unlikely to be prerenal.
Urine electrolytes, however, did give the appearance of the prerenal failure of being prerenal and for this reason the diagnosis of sclerodermal renal crisis was entertained along with the findings of hypertension.
A renal biopsy was performed on [**3-22**] the results of which were not diagnostic for sclerodermal renal crisis, however, the size of tissue used was likely inadequate.
This time the biopsy results returned with findings of fibrinoid necrosis consistent with sclerodermal renal crisis.
The recommendation made around the time of the first biopsy was to begin ace inhibitor therapy as this was a treatment of choice for sclerodermal renal crisis and this was continued and a higher dose after the second biopsy results came back with Enalapril intravenous with goals to keep the systolic blood pressure in the range of 100 to 120.
The patient required dialysis as she continued to have volume overload that was not amenable to medical therapy as well as continuously rising BUN and creatinine concerning for uremia.
Hematology:  The patient had evidence of DIC starting as early as the second day of her hospitalization in the Medical Intensive Care Unit with D-dimers greater then [**2173**] as well as thrombocytopenia elevated FDP and decreased fibrinogen.
These findings were also consistent with a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia likely due to the sclerodermal renal crisis in the kidneys.
Treatment was supportive with fresh frozen platelets given for elevated INR and platelets given during periprocedural bleeding.
The patient also developed HLA antibodies, which necessitated the treatment with HLA specific platelets.
The patient also had evidence of a hemolytic anemia, which could be due in part to resorptive hemosiderin and blood break down products from the lungs due to the diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, however, were also likely due in part to a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.
Treatment was largely supportive with blood products being given for hematocrits that showed evidence of continued decline or hematocrits below 30.
Infectious disease:  Throughout the course of her hospital stay multiple blood cultures were taken, which showed no evidence of bacterial growth in the blood.
There was one culture that was positive for diphtheroids, however, this was likely a contaminant given all negative blood cultures prior to and after that with no antibiotic dosing being given at that time.
There was one bottle also that grew out yeast, however, this was likely also a colonizer as after the line was changed there was no evidence of fungemia by follow up blood cultures or by clinical status.
Cytoxan was discussed as a possible therapy for the diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, however, it was felt that given the patient's thrombocytopenia and likely period of ongoing infections being possible in her somewhat immunocompromised state it was decided that Cytoxan would likely be riskier to use then its potential benefits and therapy was continued with pulse dose steroids along with plasmapheresis.
Posterior oropharyngeal hematoma:  On [**4-2**] the patient began to have some bleeding from her posterior oropharynx during an attempted transesophageal echocardiogram.
It is likely due in part to trauma to the procedure as well as the underlying thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorder.
Packing was put in place and the patient was evaluated by otolaryngology who recommended placing packing in addition to the packing in place and were planning on removing the packing on Monday [**4-7**], to have a reevaluation of the wound site.
However, due to worsening alveolar hemorrhage the patient expired on [**4-6**].
