Admission Date:  [**2155-8-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2155-8-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2079-10-10**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MEDICINE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a past medical history notable for peptic ulcer disease with a history of "bleeding ulcer," coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2 and multiple sclerosis, who presented to the [**Hospital1 69**] emergency department early on the morning of admission complaining of epigastric pain.
The patient stated that, approximately two weeks prior to presentation, she began experiencing diarrhea alternating with constipation.
The patient denied having any recent hematochezia, hemoptysis or hematemesis.
At approximately 2 AM on the morning of admission, the patient was awakened by epigastric pain which was [**6-10**] in severity and constant in duration.
She felt that it was well localized to her epigastrium, although she admitted that she also experienced interscapular pain with this episode of epigastric pain.
She was not surprised by this, as she reported that she had interscapular pain "whenever I get stomachaches--since I was a kid."
The patient was brought by EMS to the [**Hospital1 69**] emergency department, where her pain abated completely shortly after receiving Maalox at approximately 9:30 AM.
She denied any other change in her bowel or bladder patterns.
She specifically denied fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or headache.
She denied sore throat, cough, recent change in weight and night sweats.
In terms of the patient's cardiovascular status, she specifically denied having had any pain radiating to her left jaw (her anginal equivalent) since her coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2141**].
She denied chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lower extremity edema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea.
(Although she used two pillows for sleeping, she said that she did not become dyspneic without them.)
The patient denied any recent illnesses, including changes in her multiple sclerosis.
Similarly, she denied recent changes in her appetite, diet and medication regimen.
Coronary artery disease:  The patient had no history of known myocardial infarction.
She did have angina (left jaw pain), which led to cardiac catheterization, which subsequently led to coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2151**].
The patient had not had any angina since her coronary artery bypass grafting.
Congestive heart failure:  The patient had an ejection fraction of 20-25% by echocardiogram in [**2155-10-2**] with left ventricular hypokinesis, moderate mitral regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension.
No intervention was required at that time.
No pertinent records were currently available for this history of bleeding ulcer.
Diabetes mellitus type 2:  This was diagnosed approximately one year prior to admission, per the patient.
Per the patient, this had not affected her vision but rather her lower extremities and balance, such that she had difficulty walking well.
Mild dementia.
Urinary incontinence, likely functional, as the patient had trouble getting to the bathroom in time.
History of right shoulder pain, status post a fall.
Chronic lower back pain, which continued status post laminectomy in [**2148**].
Status post surgery to correct trigeminal neuralgia in [**2118**].
In general, the patient was a pleasant 75-year-old woman, awake and in bed, in no acute distress.
The neck was supple without thyromegaly, jugular venous distention, lymphadenopathy or bruits.
The heart had a II/VI systolic ejection murmur heard maximally at the apex with a sinus S1 and S2 and no rubs or gallops.
The chest had mildly decreased breath sounds with occasional rhonchi at the bases bilaterally.
The abdomen was soft, but mildly tender to palpation, especially in the left lower quadrant.
The abdomen was nondistended with positive normal active bowel sounds.
There was a well healed midline scar, apparently due to exploratory laparotomy, which eventually led to appendectomy.
The patient was nasogastrically lavaged in the emergency department with 250 cc of fluid, revealing no blood and no bile.
In the extremities, the venous graft harvest site was well healed at the right lower extremity with no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
RADIOLOGY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  The chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with no increase in pulmonary vasculature and no infiltrates or effusions.
There was degenerative joint disease of the spine.
There was no air under the diaphragm.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  The electrocardiogram showed an old left bundle branch block and sinus rhythm with no acute changes.
A visible vessel suggested recent bleeding.
Nasogastric lavage could not successfully clear the patient and thus she was transferred to the medical intensive care unit.
Following embolization, the patient experienced a second mild hematocrit drop and was transfused an additional two units.
Following conclusion of the Prevpac, the patient should be maintained on Protonix or some other gastrointestinal prophylaxis and she should not be given non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin, as she has a risk of re-bleeding.
Other gastrointestinal issues for the patient include the fact that she has a history of decreased stool caliber for approximately the past five years.
CARDIOVASCULAR: a) In terms of the patient's coronary artery disease, she was ruled out for myocardial infarction.
She was continued on Lipitor, Lopressor and a cardiac diet.
b) In terms of the patient's blood pressure, pump status and history of congestive heart failure, she was continued on Lopressor and Lasix.
FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  Following embolization, the patient's diet was advanced successfully and she tolerated it without nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
History of coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
