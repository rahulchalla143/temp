Admission Date:  [**2132-11-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2132-12-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2051-9-27**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Lipitor  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2132-12-2**] LV Apico-Aortic Valved Conduit via Left Thoracotomy(16mm LV Apical Connector with a 18mm Porcine Valved Conduit)   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 40134**] is an 81 year-old gentleman with an extensive history of coronary artery disease, s/p AMI at age 37, CABG in [**2115**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM1) with redo in [**2121**] (occuded LIMA-LAD and SVG-PDA, RIMA-LAD,SVG-PDA, SVG-OM2).
He had a [**2129**] catheterization for NSTEMI and underwent PCI of 90% lesion in the OM1 with a 3 x 8 mm Cypher DES.
History also significant for CHF with an an EF of 25% s/p cardiac resynchronization and biventricular pacemaker placement, hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
Over the last few weeks, he has noticed SOB at rest.
The tightness was across his chest with no radiation.
He would occasionally have nausea with it but no diapheresis.
Usually lasted a few minutes and would be relieved, at times, with burping or walking.
He did not note any of the tightness with exertion.
He notes that the pain is not like that of his MI, which was back pain and much more severe.
Over the last week he has noticed that the symptoms are increasing in frequency (now occuring daily).
His symptoms improved with intravenous Lasix and he was eventually transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac surgical evaluation.

The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferolateral, lateral, anteroseptal and apical segments.
There is hypokinesis of the remaining segments, with relative preservation of only the basal and mid-inferior segments and basal anterior segment (LVEF = 25%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system  demonstrates severe native vessel disease.
The AV groove LCx is a small vessel- OM1 is 90% occluded and beyond OM1 there is a subtotal occlusion.
Widespread ground-glass opacities with upper lung distribution.
Radiological pattern is consistent with respiratory bronchiolitis (in a smoker), hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or acute viral infection such as viral, less likely pulmonary hemorrhage.
Extensive atherosclerotic coronary and aortic calcifications.
Severe aortic valve calcifications consistent with known aortic stenosis.
Bilateral left more than right pleural effusions.
Possible left ventricular aneurysm [**2132-11-25**] Carotid Ultrasound: Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.
He was noted to be in atrial fibrillation and started on intravenous Heparin.
An echocardiogram revealed substantial increase in aortic stenosis and pulmonary pressures, while left ventricular function and the severity of mitral regurgitation appeared similar in comparison to [**2129**] - see result section for additional details.
He was also cleared by the dental service after clinical and radiographic examinations showed no obvious infection.
Given the location of the RIMA and extensive aortic calcifications, it was decided to proceed with LV apico-aortic valved conduit approach via thoracotmy rather than median sternotomy.
His preoperative course was otherwise uneventful and he remained pain free on medical therapy.
He was initially maintained on Amiodarone for ventricular ectopy while Warfarin anticoagulation was initiated for atrial fibrillation.
Due to persistent postop hypotension, it took several days to wean from inotropic support.
He remained in atrial fibrillation with improvement in ventricular ectopy.
Over several days, he continued to make clinical improvements with diuresis and made steady progress with physical therapy.
His oxygen saturations were 95% on room air and the discharge chest x-ray showing a slight element of fluid overload.
If there is improvement in blood pressure, an ACE inhibitor should be resumed given his congestive heart failure.
