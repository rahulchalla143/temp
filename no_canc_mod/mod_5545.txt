INDICATION: 80-year-old with abdominal pain and a distended abdomen with an abdominal wall mass, question incarcerated hernia.
150 cc of Optiray was used for this examination due to patient history of debility.

CT ABDOMEN W/IV CONTRAST  There are moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
Atelectatic changes are seen at both lung bases.
Bullous changes are also seen at the right lung base.

Numerous diverticula are seen scattered throughout the colon without evidence of diverticulitis.
Mural thrombus and plaque are seen throughout the aneurysm.
There is a graft in place which begins just inferior to the left renal artery and continues through the iliac bifurcation into the common iliac arteries.
The graft appears to be a venous bypass type graft.
Calcification is seen throughout the intra-abdominal aorta.
Dense calcification is seen at the ostia of both the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries, though contrast is seen within both of these arteries.
Numerous sigmoid diverticula are seen without evidence of diverticulitis.
There is a small amount of air in the bladder secondary to the Foley catheter.
As stated above, there is a bypass graft in the abdominal aorta, extending into the iliac arteries.
Mural thrombus is seen within the common iliac artery.
The soft tissues demonstrate an extensive hematoma within the right rectus abdominis muscle and rectus sheath.
The osseous structures demonstrate degenerative changes throughout the lower thoracic and lumbar spine.
There is a mild concavity of the superior endplate of the L1 vertebral body.
Extensive hematoma within the right rectus abdominis muscle and rectus sheath as described above.

Aneurysmal dilatation is also seen of both right and left common iliac arteries.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
DR. [**First Name (STitle) 7853**] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 24357**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 24358**] Approved: SAT [**2194-2-15**] 11:36 AM  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  Reason: r/o PNA  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 79 year old man with fever, recent pna with respiratory distress.
There continues to be obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm consistent with left lower lobe volume loss with or without infiltrate and effusion.
Compared to the film from [**2-8**], there has been no significant interval change.
INDICATIONS: Respiratory failure with known aortic thrombi and mental status change, evaluate for infarct or intracranial hemorrhage.
Allowing for this, there is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There is diffuse prominence of the ventricles and sulci consistent with age-related involutional change.
There is no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.
Bone windows demonstrate no evidence of fracture.
The mastoid air cells and visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses are normally pneumatized.
Allowing for this, no acute intracranial hemorrhages or mass effect is identified.
SUN  CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST  Reason: r/o PE and f/u ulcerated aortic arch thrombosis Contrast: VISAPAQUE  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 79 year old man with h/o lung cancer now with resp distress and A-a gradient.
Please r/o PE REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: r/o PE and f/u ulcerated aortic arch thrombosis CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: History of lung cancer, now with respiratory distress and AA gradient.
Please evaluate for pulmonary embolus and follow up ulcerated aortic arch thrombosis.
CONTRAST: Intravenous nonionic, low osmolar contrast was administered due to the patient's debility as well as due to the previous contrast load from CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast performed on the same date.
Again seen are prominent calcifications of the thoracic aorta.
There are coronary arterial calcifications.
There are numerous sub cm mediastinal lymph nodes located in the left paratracheal, subcarinal, and right and left hilar distributions.
These do not individually meet criteria for pathologic enlargement and appear unchanged from the previous examination.
No filling defects are identified within the pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolus.
There is faint but incomplete visualization of the previously described mural thrombus extending from the aortic arch inferiorly, with irregular margins.
In comparison with the previous examination, there is interval increase in left- sided pleural effusion, which tracks along the major fissure.
An area of rounded fluid density seen within the major fissure superiorly (series 3 image 43) is consistent with loculated fluid within the fissure.
The pleural effusion measures approximately 14 to 24 Hounsfield units in density.
There are bilateral calcified pleural plaques and emphysematous changes bilaterally.
Stable appearance of atelectasis within the left lower lobe.
There are scattered peripheral nonspecific nodular opacities within the right lower lobe (series 3, image 48 and image 44), unchanged from previous examination.
Limited images of the upper abdomen including limited images of the liver, spleen, and stomach appear unremarkable.
There are multiple old, healing, rib fractures on the right.
Multiplanar reformats: Multiplanar reformatted images demonstrate no evidence of filling defect within the pulmonary defect within the pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolus.
The mural thrombus within the aortic arch extending to the descending aorta is faintly but incompletely visualized.
No pulmonary embolus.
Interval increase in large left-sided pleural effusion layering within the fissures.
Limited visualization of mural thrombus within the aortic arch and descending aorta due to bolus timing to pulmonary arterial phase.
Multiple old right-sided rib fractures.
SUN DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 24357**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 24358**]  Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo male with past medical history significant for lung cancer, COPD, recent H. Flu pneumonia, and recent new-onset atrial fibrillation now admitted with mental status changes, respiratory failure, and rapid atrial fibrillation.
Atrial fibrillation was first documented in this patient during his last admission.
Cardiology was consulted and felt that atrial fibrillation was likely from heightened sympathetic discharge in face of acute illness.
Amiodarone was not recommended  due to beta blockade effect given significant COPD history.
Patient was extubated on [**2194-2-21**] and post extubation developed atrial fibrillation again.
Patient initially required fluid blouses and levophed for blood pressure support.
However, he also has low UOP and rising Cr, likely from poor forward flow from AF.
The treatment goal was to rate control and then diurese(massive edema with albumin of 3)  From the respiratory failure standpoint, he had thoracentesiss in [**Month (only) **], cytology:atypical and reactive cells, no CA.
On the night of [**2194-2-22**], he became increasingly tachypneic and agressive suctioning by respiratory therapy did not bring up significant mucus plug.
Patient was put on BiPAP but was showing increasing respiratory effort.
Anesthesia was called and patient was intubated without difficulty.
Patient subsequent became hypotensive and bradycardic.
The cause of death was presumed to be aspiration.
