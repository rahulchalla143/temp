[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 16988**] IGM TITER         SEE BELOW           <1:16 TITER  endoscopy: Ulcer in the cardia; Erosion in the stomach body; Erythema and congestion in the stomach body and antrum compatible with gastritis; There was no blood or active bleeding noted.
There was no blood to second portion of duodenum; There were no esophagitis or varices; Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum.
Moderate joint effusion in the left shoulder and lymph nodes, as described above.
The echogenicity suggests a large necrotic lymph node.
CT RUE: 7.4 x 2.3 x 2.2 cm multilobulated peripherally enhancing mass in the antecubital fossa, most consistent with necrotic lymph nodes given patient's history of cat scratch disease.
Although this peripherally enhancing mass is likely extracapsular in location, given the lack of posterior fat-pad displacement, an ultrasound examination is recommended to better exclude an infectious arthropathy.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is  seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
The atrial  septum appears thickened with echodense material consistent with a patch.
No  atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
A single tilting disk mitral valve prosthesis is present.
A posteriorly directed  moderate-to-severe eccentric paravalvular mitral prosthesis leak is present.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No mitral valve abscess is  seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
Lshoulder XR: There is no evidence of fracture or dislocation.
No evidence of osteomyelitis is identified.
The small effusion cannot be evaluated by the plain radiograph.
Bone scan: No focal abnormal tracer activity in the hands and upper extremities to suggest the presence of osteomyelitis.
Nonspecific increased tracer activity in multiple joints of both upper extremities is suggestive of degenerative change.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 50 yo woman with history of mitral valve repair (x3) on coumadin, tricuspid valave annuloplasty ring, atrial fibrillation, and recent cat scratch who presented with 4 days of melena and a hematocrit of 10.8, as well as INR of >88.
She had one day of low O2 saturations (high 80s) and required brief intubation, during which time she had an endoscopy, which found gastritis, an ulcer in the cardia, and an erosion in the stomach body, neither of which were actively bleeding and both of which were felt to be likely causes of her GI bleed and anemia.
Supratherapeutic INR: The patient arrived with a very elevated INR of >88 (the limit of our laboratory).
She denied taking poor POs and denied low vitamin K diet.
She was given heparin IV to bridge her when she fell below 2.5 given her high risk of thrombus to her mechanical valve.
Pasteurella bacteremia: The patient suffered cat scratches approximately 7-10 days prior to admission.
She was found to grow [**4-16**] blood cultures bottles of pasteurella and was treated with ceftriaxone.
As the patient also appeared to have mental status changes in the MICU, she was started on meningitis doses.
She was also noted to have persistent edema in her bilateral arms/wrists/hands.
Plain films, CT scan, and bone scan were all negative for osteomyelitis.
Upper extremity ultrasounds showed no DVT, but did show some left antecubital necrotic lymph nodes.
She worked with physical therapy to mobilize her arms and the edema appeared to respond somewhat to this.
The patient also had persistent pain in her left shoulder with markedly reduced range of motion.
CT of her left shoulder showed no sign of osteomyelitis or effusion.
Given hte absence of meningitis (presumed), endocarditis, and osteomyolitis, the patient was switched to PO levofloxacin on the last day of hospitalization, to finish a total of three weeks of treatment, which is scheduled to end on [**2182-5-17**].
On the day prior to discharge the patinet's bartonella results came back positive IgG but negative IgM.
She is on coumadin, as stated above, for anticoagulation and stroke risk reduction.
Hyperemia of hands: The patients hands remained erythematous adn in some places pale throughout her stay.
Although she has no stated history of Raynaud's disease, and denied exacerbation in the cold, the patient stated that her hands did not appear abnormal to her and they "look purple all winter and red all summer."
She likely has Raynaud's disease.
A TEE performed during her hospitalization showed paravalvular leak.
Access: During her stay the patient had a L subclavian central catheter and a L antecubital PICC.
General: It remains unclear to us whether Ms. [**Known lastname **] has an underlying diagnosis of liver disease or some other systemic illness.
She comes in on chronic diuretic therapy for lower extremity edema, yet does not have heart failure by echo.
When her diuretics were held during this hospitalization she indeed did develop pitting edema bilaterally.
Spot urine had an elevated protein/Cr ratio, however 24 hour urine collection showed protein in the normal range.
She is at baseline somewhat ill-appearing and also presented with a very low albumin.
She was also instructed ot have her bloodwork drawn for INR check two days after d/c and twice per week after that, and faxed to her usual PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] well as to have labwork faxed to our infectious disease clinic once per week.
