History of Present Illness: 67 yo with recent history of diverticular abscess (s/p IR drainage [**2-21**]) and HIT developed during that admission who presented to an OSH ED with dyspnea.
On day of admission, in the OSH ED was found to have bilateral segmental PEs and was noted to have a BP of 80/50.
Due to her HIT allergy, she was started on lepiridun and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for initiation of lepirudin and close monitoring.
Brief history of illness:  Patient presented to PCP after experiencing several days of increasing severe abdominal pain, diagnosed with diverticulitis and diverticular abscess by CT at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].
On [**3-1**], patient developed an impressive morbilliform rash on her trunk, visited primary surgeon the next day who removed flagyl antibiotic, suspecting this was cause of drug rash, given prednisone course + benadryl.
On admission to the ER today, patient had sudden increase of area and hue of rash, becoming increasingly bright erythema with mild pruritis.
Past Medical History: 1. gout 2. gerd 3. htn 4. s/p hip replacement  Allergies:  Flagyl (rash as above), ?levofloxacin.
No recent travel nor exposures.
Father with adult-onset diabetes.
Heart: RRR, nl S1, S2, no extra sounds.
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
The venogram demonstrated a single patent inferior vena cava with no evidence of intracaval thrombosis.
Flow voids from the renal veins indicated patency of the renal veins bilaterally.
[**2144-3-10**] Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound: Deep venous thrombosis involving the left common femoral and popliteal veins.
[**2144-3-10**] ECHO: Suboptimal image quality.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
There are no pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary processes.

PE: Left leg DVT seen on U/S seems like the most likely source - likely from venous stasis due to recent immobility following her diverticular abscess and drainage placement.
TTE showed some depressed RV function but was of poor technical quality.
Diverticular abscess: Patient needs broad GI gram neg.
Continue zosyn likely until abdominal surgery.
Drug rash stable.
H/o gout: Continue allopurinol.
PPX: PPI, argatroban/coumadin (no heparin), bowel regimen, RISS with prednisone.
Hydroxyzine HCl 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pruritus.
2. bilateral pulmonary emboli.
If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms, call your PCP or return to the hospital.
