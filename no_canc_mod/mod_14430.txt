Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation Percutaneous Gastric feeding tube placement   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a 64 year old male with extensive cardiac history, including CAD (s/p CABG, cath), a-fib on sotolol, with pacer and ICD([**Hospital1 **]-ventricular) presents after transfer from [**Hospital 58921**] Center in NH.
The patient had fallen down and hit his head on the counter.
This lasted about one minute and she reports that it is similar to past episodes of "tachycardia."
He states he was in his usual state of health, denies preceeding chets pain, shortness of breath but did feel "foggy".
Of note, he has presented with syncope and/or nausea and fatigue at least twice in the past ([**2187**] and [**2189**], both times with monomorphic VT seen after interrogating his ICD).
He was noted to have a stable head CT, with a white count of 11.4 and INR 2.1.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy    [**2187-11-27**]: severe LV dysfunction, biatrial enlargement, mod    MR, mild to mod TR, mod pulm HTN with est RV systolic    pressure of 47 mmHg 2.
HTN 4.
High cholesterol 10.
Supraspinatus impingement of left shoulder  Social History: He quit smoking 10 years ago and has occassional EtOHuse.
Family History: Brother died of heart problems at age 42.

No mass effect.
Compared to the outside hospital CT study performed at [**Hospital3 17921**] Center on [**2191-1-5**] at 5:49 p.m., there has been no appreciable interval change.
New mild cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
No overt pulmonary edema.
No evidence of pneumonia  CT head [**1-11**] Resolution of a tiny amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left central sulcus.
CT head [**1-14**] IMPRESSION: No new hemorrhage.
Large left MCA territory infarct, which is not acute, but is new since CT of [**1-14**], as mentioned in the evaluation by the stroke service in the [**Hospital 58922**] Medical Record.
Chest X-Ray [**1-14**] Complete white out of the left hemithorax is new associated with mild cardiomediastinal shifting towards the left side.
There is no right pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
CT head [**1-15**] IMPRESSION: Acute left MCA infarct without significant interval change in mass effect or evidence of hemorrhage compared with [**2191-1-14**].
CT head [**1-16**] IMPRESSION: Continued evolution of acute left MCA infarct without increasing edema or acute hemorrhage.
Less than 40% stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid arteries.
Reversal of flow on the left vertebral artery, associated with monophasic waveforms in the left brachial artery is suggestive of left subclavian artery stenosis.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage was found on head CT, anticoagulation was reversed and he patient closely monitored (see below).
He, however, had a new episode of VT while admitted to MICU for which a code blue was called but no ACLS was necessary as ICD fired multiple times.
Patient became increasingly anxious about defibrillation and after informed consent was obtained, underwent a VT ablation.
Procedure was complicated by large ischemic stroke (see below).
Patient will need INR monitoring in rehab facility  ISCHEMIC STROKE: On [**2192-1-15**], the morning after his VT ablation procedure and while still intubated, the patient was noted to have right-sided hemiparesis and facial droop when the sedation was decreased.
STAT head CT showed a large area of hypodensity in the left MCA territory consistent with subacute infarct.
Patient was closely monitored and serial CT scans were obtained; no signs of hemorrhagic transformation were noted.
He had an episode of aspiration secondary to decreased gag reflex and developed aspiration pneumonia (see below).
Anticoagulation was started shortly after the event as etiology was felt to be embolic, most likely from a cardiac source.
ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA: Following extubation post VT ablation and in the first hours post stroke, patient had increased oxygen requirement.
Chest X-ray revealed diffuse consolidation of left lung, consistent with significant aspiration event.
At the time of discharge, he was afebrile and with good oxygen saturation on room air.
SUB-ARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE: Small peri-frontal SAH was noted on admission, which showed radiographic resolution on follow up CT.
This process appears to have been independent of subsequent MCA stroke.
CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Medical regimen was altered per events above, mainly as systolic blood pressure goals were adjusted.
Patient however did not show any signs of decompensated failure and was started on maximally tolerated regimen before discharge, including beta blocker and ace inhibitor as allowed by PEG tube administration.
Darvocet prn pain  Discharge Medications: 1.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
DuoNeb 0.5-2.5 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) treatment Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Ventricular tachycardia 2.
Ischemic Left MCA stroke 3.
Chronic Systolic Heart Failure  SECONDARY DIAGNOSES 1.
Hypertension 2.
Hyperlipidemia   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, with right hemiparesis   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you fainted and had a fall.
We found out that your pacemaker had given you shocks because you developed an unstable heart rhythm.
During your hospitalization, we attemtped several different medications but you continued to have this irregular heart rhythm and defibrillator shocks.
You underwent a special procedure to try to repair the problem, and it seems to have significantly decreased this irregular activity.
After the procedure however, you suffered a severe stroke that affected your right side.
If you experience worsening weakness, chest pain, multiple new shocks, or any other symptom that concerns you, please seek medical attention immediately.
