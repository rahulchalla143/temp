She was admitted there for hypercarbic respiratory failure and intubated secondary to CO2 retention when given oxygen at the outside hospital.
She was subsequently sent to their Intensive Care Unit and extubated, at which point she was found to have an infection of her sternotomy wound.
She was also in mild renal failure during her hospitalization which was resolving upon transfer.

Hypertension 3.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 4.

Status post carpal tunnel release surgery  ALLERGIES:  She had no known drug allergies.
Atrovent and albuterol metered dose inhaler 2 puffs 4x per day  SOCIAL HISTORY:  Significant for ex-smoker who stopped seven years ago.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION: VITAL SIGNS:  She was afebrile with a pulse in the high 90s and a blood pressure in the high 180s/90s.
Gram stain of the wound demonstrated gram positive cocci in pairs, chains and clusters.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  After consultation with cardiac surgery, the patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**8-25**] where a radical sternal debridement and open packing of the wound were performed for a sternal wound infection with associated sternal osteomyelitis.
The cultures obtained from the sternal swab in the Emergency Room had demonstrated coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus, probable Enterococcus and Proteus.
The plastic surgeons recommended flap closure of the wound and the patient was taken to the Operating Room once again on [**8-29**] where an omental flap closure of his sternal wound was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], assisted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Given the development of acute renal failure, the patient's antibiotics were changed to renal doses.
The FENa was not less than 1% and there was no evidence of acute interstitial nephritis at the time.
Over the next couple of days, the renal failure began to resolve with a decrease in the creatinine to 1.9 and then 1.8 respectively.
The patient was making good urine and remained afebrile with stable vital signs.
Given the fact that her sternotomy was healing very well with no erythema, edema, induration or drainage and the abdominal incision that was used for a flap was well healed with any erythema, edema, induration or drainage and that the patient had a PICC line placed and was capable of having intravenous antibiotics at a rehabilitation facility, it was felt that she was stable for transfer.
