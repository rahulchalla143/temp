Congestive heart failure.
Left ventricular aneurysm.
Atrial Flutter 6.
Hypertension 7.
Hypercholesterolemia 8.
Severe mitral valve regurgitation   Social History: The patient works as a roofer.
he quit smoking 4 years ago   Family History: Father: History of CVA at age 72.

Severe pulmonary hypertension and elevated filling pressures, which improved by the end of the case.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Compared to the findings of the prior study of [**2147-6-27**], the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
Diffusely heterogeneous and coarsened echotexture to the liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Likely areas of focal fatty sparing, however a short term follow-up study (approx 3 months) is recommended to exclude space occupying lesions.
Ectatic aorta, although no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation.
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2148-5-2**] for a cardiac catheterization  and surgical management of his mitral valve disease.
The cardiac catheterization was significant for severe left main disease, a 95% stenosed left anterior descending artery, a moderately disease circumflex artery and severe mitral valve regurgitation.
Milrinone was started for a low cardiac index however as this caused tachycardia vasopressin was used with good effect.
an Echocardiogram was obtained which showed an ejection fraction of 25%, an apical left ventricular aneurysm, 3+ mitral regurgitation and a moderately dilated left ventricular cavity.
A prophylactic intra-aortic balloon pump was placed prior to surgery given his low ejection fraction.
He again developed rapid atrial fibrillation which was rate controlled with beta blockade.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed some slight sternal serous drainage from the inferior aspect of his sternotomy.
Cultures of his sternal wound were negative and the vancomycin was discontinued.
Beta blockade was adjusted for appropriate rate control of his atrial fibrillation.
Call if you experience increasing shortness of breath, worsening chest pain, or light-headedness/fainting.
Call if your incision becomes increasingly red or painful, or if you experience drainage from the wound.
