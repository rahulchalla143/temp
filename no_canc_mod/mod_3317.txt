He was admitted from his PCP's office to an OSH for evaluation of new pan-cytopenia 2.1>28%<83, acute renal failure and symptoms of fatigue and weakness.
He developed worsening oliguric renal failure and new heart failure and was tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-5**] for further workup of renal dysfunction and new pancytopenia.
Since transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] it was thought that he was suffering renal failure from ATN in setting of some combination of poor PO intake, hypotension on BP meds and contrast load at OSH.
He has also been evaluated by the hematology service and bone marrow suppression thought likely due to suppression in setting of acute illness but also pending EBV, CMV, parvovirus, SPEP.
UPEP negative for monoclonal spike.
Hepatitis serologies negative.
Of note, his blood cultures have grown out Ampicillin sensitive enterococci, and he had a TTE just yesterday showing a large aortic valve vegetation.
He's also had a fair amount of anginal-type chest pain and was evaluated by cardiology.
He's had anginal chest pain for quite a while, maybe x2 / month, worsened with exertion and relieved with rest.
Tonight, his HR increased to the 140s, in sinus, with lateral ST depressions, which resolved with rate control using Metoprolol 5mg IV.
He looks well, but has some minor anterior chest pain.

STUDIES:  RENAL U/S [**2166-7-5**]: IMPRESSION: Normal sized kidneys, with mildly increased cortical echogenicity suggestive of renal disease.
Interval resolution of previoulsy seen bilateral hydronephrosis.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anteroseptal/anterior hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There is a large vegetation on the aortic valve.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Eccentric mild to moderate ([**1-12**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
At least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with depressed free wall contractility.
Mild to moderate ([**1-12**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No obvious abscess seen but cannot be axcluded on the basis of this study.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
Adjacent consolidation is most likely atelectasis, but infection cannot be excluded.
Small right middle lobe consolidation is also most likely atelectasis, less likely infection.
Mild pulmonary edema.
Mild centrilobular emphysema.
Mild splenomegaly.
CT HEAD W/O [**2166-7-11**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
CT has poor sensitive for small embolic infarcts.
TTE [**2166-7-16**]: Conclusions Focused views to assess size of known aortic valve vegetation and degree of aortic regurgitation.
The degree of aortic regurgitation is still in the mild-moderate range.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis to akinesis of the mid to distal anterior septum, anterior wall, and apex.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated and mildly hypokinetic.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**7-16**]/201, the vegetation size appears similar but the severity of aortic regurgitation is slightly increased.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 18654**] is a 69year old M with CAD s/p CABG, who presented with chest pain, tachycardia, found to have high grade enterococcal bacteremia with native aortic valve vegetation.
He was transfered to the ICU for hypoxia and unstable angina.
Cardiology followed the pt and felt that his chest pain was [**2-12**] heart failure and volume overload.
His hospitalization was complicated by acute renal failure thought to be ATN, requiring dialysis.
# Enterococcal endocarditis: Pt has a history of enterococcal UTI in setting of past prostatectomy/radiation and radiation cystitis with a recent admission in [**2166-1-11**] for enterococcal UTI.
His course was complicated by new heart failure.
Cardiology followed the pt, and attributed his chest pain to heart failure and volume overload.
He had a PA cathether placed which suggested more of a septic than cardiogenic picture of hypotension.
As discussed below, he had dialsysis for fluid removal.
Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted, and recommended no intervention.
Repeat TTE on [**7-11**] showed no change, with no severe AI.
TTE was again repeated on [**7-16**], and showed mildly increased base of vegetation, but continued mild-moderate AR.
Repeat echo done [**2166-7-23**] that showed a stable vegetation with slight increase in aortic regurgitation.
# Acute renal failure: Secondary to ATN with no evidence of abscess or septic emboli from imaging at OSH and no evidence of abscess on u/s here.
ATN thought to be secondary to poor PO intake, volume contraction/hypotension.
He had a line holiday given bacteremia as discussed above, on [**2166-7-18**] a tunneled HD line was placed.
He had dialyis with intervening hemofiltration to remove fluid as quickly as possible.
# Acute Systolic CHF: Thought to be [**2-12**] new onset heart failure and volume overload as discussed above.
ECG demonstrated ST depressions in precordial and lateral leads.
He should follow-up with his cardiologist as an outpatient to decide whether intervention for his angina would be beneficial once his symptoms have stabilized.
Fluid overload, with components of acute pulmonary edema and chronic lung disease.
# Delirium: Pt became confused as to the date, and appeared delirious during his MICU course.
A CT head showed no acute process.
Serial neurologic exams remained nonfocal.
13. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) nebulizer Inhalation Q2H (every 2 hours) as needed for shortness of breath.
15. morphine 5 mg/mL Solution Sig: One (1) mg Injection Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for dyspnea: To ease breathing for refractory dyspnea.
20. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] TCU - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Enterococcal bacteremia Enterococcal native aortic valve endocarditis Acute renal failure Pancytopenia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for an infection in your blood causing injury to your heart, lungs, and bone marrow.
Your aortic heart valve became infected from the infection in your blood and you need a long course of antibiotics (ampicillin and gentamicin) to clear the infection, which were started while you were in the intensive care unit.
Also, your kidneys were damaged because of low blood flow during the infection.
Your kidneys were no longer able to produce urine and you needed to have dialysis to remove fluid from your body.
You were having difficulty breathing, which was from the fluid in your lungs.
You also had episodes of chest pain that were relieved with nitroglycerin and your ECG showed changes that were consistent with your known heart disease and the extra demand on your heart from the infection.
You will continue to get dialysis at the facility if your kidneys are still not working.
Followup Instructions: Name: [**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4094**]: INTERNAL MEDICINE Location: [**Hospital1 **] HEALTHCARE - [**Location (un) **] Address: [**Location (un) **], [**Location (un) **],[**Numeric Identifier 6698**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6699**] **Please discuss with the staff at the facility the need for a follow up appointment with your PCP when you are ready for discharge**  You have an appointment with infectious disease on [**2166-8-4**] at 11:30am because of the infection on your heart valve.
