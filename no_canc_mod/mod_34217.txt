Admission Date:  [**2121-7-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2121-7-21**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**] Chief Complaint: Groin pain/hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 38758**] is an 85 year old woman with recent right total hip replacement (~6 days ago) at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].
On the day prior to admission, she presented with groin pain and was found to be hypotensive (81/35) without obvious etiology.
She was given levofloxacin and metronidazole for possible infection, calcium for possible Beta blocker toxicity (unclear how many beta blockers she is on, but she was never bradycardic); her hematocrit was noted to be stable since discharge.
She had no reported history of abdominal pain.
Per report, the BIN non-contrast CT abd/pelvis showed atelectasis, a minimally enlarged gall bladder, and a question of colitis, without RP bleed.
A CT with IV contrast (Mucomyst given) was ordered given a slightly lower creatinine on repeat labs.
An echo (by cards fellow) to evaluate for RV strain demonstrated minimal RV dilatation with no focal wall abnormality.
CT torso demonstrated no PE, atelectasis, CBD dilation without obstruction, cholelithiasis, and peripancreatic stranding less prominent than on [**Location (un) 620**] CT. A RUQ ultrasound demonstrated a distended gall bladder with pericholecystic and perihepatic fluid, with gallstone and mild GB wall thickening, consistent with acute cholecystitis.
She was seen by surgery, who thought she didn't appear clinically to have cholecystitis or pancreatic, so she was admitted to medicine with surgery following.
On arrival to the unit, she complains of terrible pain in her right groin and leg.
She denies fevers, chills, dysuria (although she reports not being able to urinate on her own since leaving the hospital), constipation, mild abdominal discomfort, nausea, and a chronic cough (months) that is non-productive.
