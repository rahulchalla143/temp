Admission Date:  [**2193-10-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2193-10-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2133-12-29**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Gluten  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: asystolic in-home arrest s/p resuscitation  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: endotracheal intubation central venous line in right internal jugular vein atrial line foley catheterization cardiac catheterization  History of Present Illness: 59F with PMHx of HTN found down at home at roughly 4-4:30 AM on the day of admission non responsive by husband who called EMS.
Epinephrinex1, Atropinex1, shocks x2, and started on amiodarone with return of Sinus Rhythym.
At cath a tortuous LAD with distal LAD lesion was found but determined to be unintervenable disease and medical management was undertaken.
LV gram showeeEF 55% with apical dyskinesis and non infarct zone hyperkinesis.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: hypertension 2.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
The LAD was a tortuous vessel and had a distal occlusion with faint collaterals.
Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated systemic arterial pressures with SBP 148 mm Hg and DBP 94 mm Hg.
There was no transaortic valvular gradient.
Left ventriculography revealed no mitral regurgitation.
The LVEF was estimated at 50-55% with focal apical dyskinesis.
Mild systolic ventricular dysfunction.
Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by medical therapy  [**2193-10-25**] CXR: SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is an endotracheal tube with the tip approximately 4.7 cm away from the carina.
Bilateral interstitial thickening especially in bilateral upper lobes and perihilar areas are noted.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral upper lung and perihilar interstitial thickening likely representing pulmonary edema.
[**2193-10-26**]:NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or vascular territorial infarction.
There is no fracture.
The included paranasal sinuses reveal an air-fluid level dependently in the maxillary sinus on the right.
The included mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process, with preservation of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation and no evidence of cerebral edema.
There is no decreased diffusion to indicate an acute infarct.
There is no midline shift.
There is no definite evidence of hemorrhage, although there is marked degradation of image quality on the gradient echo sequence.
There is no extra-axial fluid collection.
Minimal mucosal thickening is noted in the maxillary sinuses and ethmoid air cells.
Grossly unremarkable MRI, without evidence of acute intracranial pathology or acute infarct although image quality is markedly degraded by patient motion.
Scattered white matter hyperintensities are a nonspecific finding.
However, given the patient's age, the findings likely reflect the sequela of chronic microangiopathy.
[**2193-10-27**] EEG: FINDINGS: ROUTINE TIME SAMPLING: Showed mixed theta frequencies which, at times, became rhythmic and semi-rhythmic for periods of several seconds.
These contained periods of rhythmic theta activity as described in the routine sampling portions.
These contained periods of rhythmic theta activity occasionally with sharper features concerning for potential seizure activity.
There were also independently occurring bursts of sharp, rhythmic more generalized theta activity of varying length concerning for possible seizure activity.
There were no clear clinical correlates with any of these findings on video.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were no entries in these files.
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine sampling showed a moderate encephalopathy consisting of mixed theta frequencies.
At times, there were bursts of generalized sharp rhythmic theta activity lasting several seconds which are concerning for potential seizure activity, though no obvious clinical correlate is observed on video.
There were also infrequent isolated phase reversing sharps and spikes occurring at T3, P3, and F8, as described above.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal LV and apical akinesis (LVEF=40%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 59F with PMHx of HTN found unresponive at home s/p STEMI from distal LAD lesion that was not intervened upon who underwent artic sun cooling procedure with subsequent cardiac recovery and persistent neurologic impairment.
# CORONARIES: Patient presented apparently asystolic and then with Vfib from anterior STEMI with distal LAD lesion which could not be intervened.
Repeat TTE on [**2193-10-28**] showed EF of 40%, apical akinesis and no LV clot or thrombus.
# PUMP: No known history of heart failure, only htn.
Patient had EF 40% on LV gram with apical dyskinesis and non infarct zone hyperkinesis.
Beta blockers were started, ACEI held [**1-14**] mild orthostasis.
# RHYTHM: Patient's arrest was asystole and then Vfib.
She continued to be bradycardic during the cooling process which resolved with rewarming.
The electrophyisology team was consulted who felt that she did not require further amiodarone for prophylaxis of a a ventricular arrhythmia and would not require ICD placement at this time but will follow with her as an outpatient.
She was initiatlly treated empirically for aspiration pnemonia with Cefepime/Flagyl.
CXR performed on admission showed no evidence of infiltrate.
She continued without any significat pulmonary secretions, no fevers, and had no difficulty with oxygenation.
# Metabilic Anion Gap met acidosis: Present on admission with elevated lactate, likely from cardiogenic shock and hypoperfusion.
# Neuro: Patient was decorticate posturing on admission to CCU, concerning for poor prognosis even with cooling.
Patient tolerated 24 hours of artic sun cooling protocol and upon rewarming patient was noted to have improvement in neurologic status.
Head CT performed after rewarming was unremarkable for bleed or edema.
Continuous EEG monitoring revealed questionable spikes that were suggestive of seizure activities.
These spikes were significantly reduced with low dose ativan and she was started on keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
She will require outpatient neurologic follow up as well as intensive neurologic rehabilitation.
Also started on amio which is unlikely to cause transaminitis so acutely.
No signs of bleeding during this hospital stay.
Iron studies with nl B12 and haptoglobin, high ferretin and low TIBC, with low reticulocyte index - likely anemia of chronic disease with inappropriate bone marrow responses.
# HTN: On atenolol as outpatient for management of htn, now on hold with start of BB and ACEI.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Ventricular Fibrillation Hypertension   Discharge Condition: ambulating with one assist, on fall precautions because of memory and judgement issues Poor short term memory, needs OT and supervision.
Discharge Instructions: You had a heart attack and your heart stopped for a short time before the EMT's revived you.
You have been managed with medicines since then and have been stable with no further chest pain or irregular rhythms.
Your heart function is weak because of the heart attack but hopefully will improve in the next few months.
You need to monitor yourself for signs of fluid retention.
You had an EEG that showed some mild seizures, you were started on a medicine to prevent this.
