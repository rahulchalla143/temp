Admission Date:  [**2151-4-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2151-4-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2086-10-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3227**] Chief Complaint: Fall  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: This is a 64 year old man who was reported to have fallen out of a parked car on friday [**2151-4-2**] and over the weekend began to develop increasing lethargy and agitation.
The day of admission his mental status declined and he became increasingly combative and as a result was taken to an OSH for evaluation.
At the OSH he was initially febrile to 104 and on Head Ct was found to have subarachnoid and subdural blood as well as bilateral frontal contusions.
He was treated prophylactically for meningitis at the OSH and received Acyclovir, penicillin, Dilantin, Ativan, Vancomycin, and Rocephin.
+ ETOH  Family History: NC  Physical Exam: On Admission: O: T: 104.7  BP: 176/78  HR:110    R 28      O2Sats 99% Gen: intubated and sedated HEENT: no hemotympanum, CSF otorrhea or rhinorrhea appreciated on exam.
At times uncoperative with exam but not focal neurologic deficit.
Pain on ROM Left knee and with superior/anterior patellar palpation.
Bifrontal contusions with slight increase in surrounding edema.
Mild increase in left temporal edema.
Unchanged bilateral subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage.
There is no evidence of fracture or subluxation.
Mild multilevel degenerative changes with posterior disc osteophyte formation, especially at C3-4 place the patient at high risk for cord-ligamentous injury.
There is minimal narrowing of the spinal canal at C3-4 and C4-5 due to posterior disc osteophyte formation.
Mucosal thickening and secretions are likely secondary to intubation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine.
Minimal increase of the edema surrounding bilateral frontal contusions without evidence of midline shift or herniation.
No evidence of new hemorrhage, or infarction  CT Torso [**2151-4-6**]: 1.
No other acute injury is noted within the abdomen and pelvis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Sigmoid colon diverticulosis with no signs of diverticulitis.
Interval evolution of bifrontal hemorrhagic contusions with surrounding edema.
No evidence of midline shift or herniation.
No evidence of new hemorrhage or infarction.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is prominence of the extra-axial CSF spaces at the frontovertex, left more than right.
While this may simply reflect underlying bifrontal atrophy (more conspicuous with resolution of more acute injury), thin subdural hygromas are not excluded.
X-ray Left Knee [**2151-4-14**]: There is a small left knee joint effusion.
There is no acute fracture or malalignment.
There is no significant degenerative arthropathy seen on these nonweightbearing radiographs.
There are vascular calcifications in the thigh and popliteal fossa.
There was blossoming of the contusions as expected.
The patient's mental status improved over the next few days.
Neurology was consulted for ?meningitis and seizure management.
Neurology recommended a 10-day course of empiric therapy to treat the aspiration pneumonia.
He was evaluated by speech therapy for a swallow eval and cognition, although there was no overt aspiration, they did make diet modifications given his inattentiveness secondary to his head injury.
The patient was agitated and required restraints since he was a high fall risk given his traumatic brain injury.
He complained of Left knee pain with movement on palpation.
X-ray imaging on [**4-14**] showed a small joint effusion and a patellar bone spur.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Lorazepam 2 mg/mL Syringe Sig: 0.5 mg Injection Q4H PRN () as needed for agitation.
