He was noted to have increased work of breathing and decision was made to intubate infant.
He never received methylxanthine treatment, but did have mild apnea and bradycardia of prematurity.
Last documented apneic/bradycardic spell was on [**2152-5-8**].
An echocardiogram was performed on [**4-20**], and it demonstrated a moderate patent ductus arteriosus.
