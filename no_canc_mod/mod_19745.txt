HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year-old woman with end stage renal disease, secondary to malignant hypertension.
She has a history of gastric angiectasia which she requires endoscopy.
She does have a donor specific antibody (B-51) and will have a final T & B cell class match prior to transplantation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End stage renal disease, secondary to malignant hypertension on dialysis.
History of anemia following gastric angiectasia.
She has no known history for coronary artery disease for diabetes.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Abdomen soft and nontender.
Mild pedal edema.
Also during her operating room time, the patient also had a right iliac artery thrombosis.
It was noted that at the end of the completion of the procedure, that she had an ischemic appearing right foot and absence of a right femoral pulse.
Postoperatively, the patient had a renal ultrasound demonstrating an unremarkable renal transplant ultrasound with normal size and appearance of the transplanted kidney and normal arterial wave forms and resistive disease, ranging from 0.63 to 0.75 throughout.
On postoperative day number one, the patient had another ultrasound secondary to her hematocrit decreasing and they wanted to rule out hematoma.
The ultrasound demonstrated that there was no hematoma seen adjacent to the transplanted kidney.
The transplanted kidney is minimally changed from yesterday which was on [**2175-5-30**] with a small amount of pelvic ectasis.
The patient did get multiple transfusions for her low hematocrit.
On [**2175-6-2**], the patient had some complaint of right foot numbness.
Lower extremity ultrasound was obtained to rule out deep venous thrombosis and this showed no evidence of right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
The patient still complained of right foot numbness but it was about the same and not worse.
Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral aspect of the mid pole, probably which demonstrates normal blood flow and may represent artifact; however, attention to this area on a follow up scan is recommended to document interval change or resolution.
The patient complained of right hip and thigh pain, pitting edema of right lower extremity greater than left lower extremity so an ultrasound was performed which included the right iliac artery.
This demonstrated acute deep venous thrombosis within the right common femoral and superficial femoral veins which had developed since [**2175-6-2**].
There is a right groin hematoma which was unchanged.
The patient needs to change dressings on her wound twice a day located on her groin, place a dry gauze between the wound and her skin.
DIAGNOSES:  End stage renal disease, status post renal transplant.
Deep venous thrombosis.
