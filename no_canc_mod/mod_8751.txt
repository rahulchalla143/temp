She called EMS, CPR briefly initiated(1-2 min) No tonic-clonic movements, but + incontinence of urine.
EMS reported a weak pulse, but could not get a good BP.
Got small amount fluid in the field and then improved.
He was noted to be confused with poor short term memory.
CT head negative for acute process.
He was seen by neuro who found he had inability to form new short term memories, consistent with b/l hippocampi injury, possibly from anoxic injury.
It was felt that the situation was more consistent with a cardiac event, and he was admitted to the ICU for monitoring and work up.

STUDIES: [**2158-12-15**] - CT HEAD -IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
No pulmonary embolism.
Marked cardiomegaly, with evidence of prior myocardial infarction in the left ventricular apex, with likely areas of scarring, and aneurysm formation at the apex.
Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Pulmonary artery enlargement, concerning for pulmonary arterial hypertension.
[**2158-12-16**] - ECHOCARDIOGRAM Conclusions The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to muliple areas of severe hypokinesis and akinesis (see figure), with posterobasal dyskinesis.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is irregularity and thickening of the distal portion of the fifth metatarsal that might represent chronic old fracture.
There is additional irregularity and potential old healed fracture of the distal second metatarsal.
[**2158-12-18**] - ART EXT (REST ONLY) IMPRESSION: No evidence of right lower extremity ischemia at rest.
Mild left lower extremity peripheral [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] disease with predominant SFA/tibial location.
Brief Hospital Course: # Unresponsiveness/VTACH - 61 y.o.
man with significant cardiac history who became acutely unresponsive at home.
CPR initiated, had BP and pulse by the time EMS arrived.
No PE or pneumothorax on CTA.
The patient was admitted to MICU for hypotension and monitoring overnight.
His device was not programmed to fire for this particular arrhythmia.
The patient had no further significant arrhythmic events during this admission.
He was noted to have anterograde amnesia after his arrest which most likely related to transient ischemia in the brain.
# Osteomyelitis - The patient had a chronic left LE ulceration related to a hospitalization several years ago.
It looked erythematous and had purulent drainage on admission.
Podiatry ecommended broad spectrum antibiotics.
A foot xray was consistent with osteomyelitis.
The patient had poor arterial blood flow in his left LE and [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] surgery was consulted and they recommended angiography and possible revascularization procedure in the next week.
# CHF, systolic.
# Renal Function - The patient's creatinine began to rise during this admission most which was felt to be secondary to vancomycin toxicity.
There was not evidence of AIN, ATN or renal obstruction.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: Four (4) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Syncope from Ventricular Tachycardia Osteomyelitis Anterograde Amnesia  Secondary Diagnosis: Coronary Artery Disease Chronic Systolic Heart Failure Hypothyroidism Hyperlipidemia Depression Insomnia   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after an episode of syncope (loss of consciousness).
The cause of your syncope was an arrhythmia called Ventricular Tachycardia.
Your pacemaker was reprogrammed so that it would fire for this particular heart rhythm.
You were found to have difficulties with short term memory after this incident and will need follow up with Behavioral Neurology.
You were found to have an infection in the skin and bone of your left foot.
You had some worsening renal function likely secondary to vancomycin an antibiotic you were taking for your infection.
You will be given new prescriptions for those medications.
If you become more short of breath or notice increased weight or lower extremity swelling, please call your cardiologist.
