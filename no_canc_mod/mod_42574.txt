Admission Date:  [**2162-10-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2162-10-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2079-10-10**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5606**] Chief Complaint: Altered mental status  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP with biliary stent placement [**2162-10-14**] PEG placement on [**2162-10-27**]   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 100910**] is an 83 year-old woman with a history of severe dementia (baseline oriented to name, minimally verbal, has to be fed, non-ambulatory), depression, hypertension and hypothyroidism who was sent in from her nursing home due to worsening mental status.
According to the nursing home, she has had decreased PO intake over the past 3 days as well as fevers.
She has had increased somnolence as well with her spending a lot of time sleeping.
She was noted to have a positive U/A and was started on Levaquin.
She had a RUQ ultrasound which showed biliary stone but no evidence of cholangitis.
She was unresponsive and was unable to answer questions.
According to her nursing home, she did not have any cough, chest pain, vomiting, rashes or skin changes.
Past Medical History: - Advanced dementia - Hypertension - Hypothyroidism - Depression  Social History: Lived in [**Hospital3 537**] until recently.
GEN: No acute distress, comfortable breathing HEENT: EOMI, MMM, no oral lesions, but poor dentition NECK: Supple CHEST: CTAB CV: RRR ABD: Soft, nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds present SKIN: Ecchymoses on arms.
MRSA Screen: Negative  ECG [**2162-10-14**]: Sinus rhythm, rate 71, normal axis, nonspecific T-wave changes in anterior precordial leads.
Subsegmental atelectasis is bilateral.
There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion or focal consolidation.
There is no pulmonary edema.
Possible right axillary lymphadenopathy as well.
Numerous spinal compression deformities, with the most severe, at L3 new from [**0-0-0**] 3.
Diffuse thickening of the left adrenal gland without definite nodularity, possible hyperplasia.
Bibasilar pulmonary opacities, greater on the left than right, possibly atelectatic or infectious depending on the appropriate clinical context.
CT HEAD [**2162-10-14**]: No acute intracranial abnormality.
RUQ ULTRASOUND [**2162-10-14**]: Cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis, without specific signs to confirm cholecystitis.
Extensive DVT in the left lower extremity as above.
ERCP [**2162-10-14**]: Impression: Multiple large stones in the entire biliary tree.
Given hypotension and over all clinical condition no attempt at stone extraction was made.
CXR [**2162-10-26**] CHEST RADIOGRAPH  INDICATION: evaluation for fluid overload.
FINDINGS: Compared to the previous radiograph, there is a newly appeared opacity at the lung base.
In addition, the left lung base also shows a newly appeared parenchymal opacity in the retrocardiac lung areas.
The opacities are more likely to represent pneumonia rather than pulmonary edema, given the distribution and the lack of other signs indicative of overhydration.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged, but there is interval progression of pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: 83 year-old woman with advanced dementia presented to the hospital with acute metabolic encephalopathy from urinary tract infection with sepsis complicated by hypovolemic hypernatremia and acute kidney injury.
Further investigation found cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis without cholecystitis.
She was also found to have DVTs in both legs and was started on a heparin gtt.
PROBLEM LIST: # Cholelithiasis, Choledocholithiasis, and Cholangitis: She had an elevated alkaline phosphatase and transaminitis on admission with imaging showing cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis.
ERCP showed multiple stones that were causing partial obstruction seen at the biliary tree.
Given hypotension and over all clinical condition no attempt at stone extraction was made and a stent was placed.
If patient's condition is acceptable for undergoing an ERCP, repeat ERCP in 8 weeks for stent removal and stone extraction/lithotripsy occurs.
# UTI with E. Coli: This was treated with Unasyn as it is being used for Cholangitis (see above).
Her Hct was followed which remained stable and the patient had no further episodes.
# Hypernatremia [**3-10**] hypovolemia: Admission Na 159.
Hypernatremia resolved with volume resuscitation.
# Acute kidney injury (baseline Cr 1.1): Admission Cr 2.9.
[**Last Name (un) **] was [**3-10**] hypovolemia and sepsis.
[**Last Name (un) **] improved gradually with treatment of sepsis and hypovolemia.
# Advanced dementia with overlying delirium [**3-10**] critical illness and metabolic abnormalities including hypernatremia, hypovolemia, [**Last Name (un) **], UTI, Cholangitis, and DVT.
# Tachypnea: During the patient's hospitalization, she was noted to be intermittently tachypnic.
On [**10-26**] she had a transient episode of tachypnea vs agitation and a repeat CXR was obtained.
There was some concern for pneumonia vs asymmetric pulmonary edema.
The patient's symptoms resolved completely with a nebulizer treatment and given that she remained afebrile without a leukocytosis, antibiotics were not initiated.
CXR at that time showed some worsening of pulmonary edema.
# Nutrition: The patient had a prolonged period of being NPO as there were scheduling challenges with the PEG.
Intubation for clearly reversible respiratory failure is acceptable.
# CODE STATUS: DNR, but OK to intubate for reversible causes of respiratory failure.
Medications on Admission: 1. acetaminophen 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for fever or pain.
