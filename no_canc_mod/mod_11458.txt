S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
-PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: In [**2177**], cath showed 90% distal LM stenosis which was stented with a 3.5 x 8mm Bx velocity stent.
Also showed 80% mLAD stenosis followed by T.O, 40% D1 stenosis, 90% ostial RCA stenosis and 60% PDA stenosis.
The SVG to OM occluded at ostium, LIMA to LAD patent, distal LAD diffusely diseased.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -  Fractured rib on left from last month from coughing excessively r/t a sinus infection -  Diabetes Type II, on oral agents -  Complete hysterectomy and oopherectomy [**2176**] for ovarian CA.
No recurrence noted -   Pulmonary fibrosis - Marked restrictive ventilatory defect on PFTs and severe fibrosis and low FVC on chest CT.  Social History: She is a widow.
-Tobacco history: never smoked -ETOH: none -Illicit drugs: denied  Family History: There is a family history of hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease but not stroke.
Her mother died at 29 of gall bladder infection and her father died at 69 of stomach cancer.
Physical Exam: Physical exam on admission: VS: T=97.3 BP=125-132/71 HR=60 RR=38 O2 sat=94% RA GENERAL: Elderly woman, lying in bed, mildly short of breath when speaking HEENT: PERRL, EOMI.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
CARDIAC: S1, S2 obscured, Grade IV/VI crescendo-decrescendo systolic ejection murmur radiating to the carotics LUNGS: Mild shortness of breath.
Moving air appropriately, dry crackles diffusely ABDOMEN: +bs, soft, multiple scars well healed.
EXTREMITIES: 1+ edema to the ankles b/l, mild edema in the hands, r>l SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
No evidence of cerebral artery occlusion.
Atherosclerotic disease as mentioned above.
Lung parenchymal opacities better appreciated on recent lung imaging.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent, suggestive of age-related volume loss.
Echo: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
Trace aortic regurgitation and a very small paravalvular leak are seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Well-seated, normally functioning aortic CoreValve prosthesis with trace aortic regurgitation and a very small paravalvular leak.
Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Previously, the very small aortic paravalvular leak was not commented upon, but appears to have been present.

# Aortic stenosis: Patient has critical aortic stenosis with most recent valve area measurement of 0.7 cm2.
She is currently showing symptoms of dyspnea on minimal exertion.
# Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis: New diagnosis for patient, but likely long-standing.
Dyspnea on exertion is at least particially due to pulmonary disease.
Recent CT chest showed severe diffuse pulmonary fibrosis and marked restrictive ventilatory defect on PFTs.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for observation and recovery.
Shortly following arrival in CVICU, the patient developed cardiac arrest requiring re-intubation and resuscitation.
Echo revealed free air in the right atrium and ventricles.
She also developed rapid atrial fibrillation and eventually converted to SR with electrical and chemical cardioversion.
Transvenous wire was placed on [**2-10**] at the bedside by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for second degree heart block.
