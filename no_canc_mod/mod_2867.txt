Pt had enterobacter and pseudomonas pneumonia at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
After gent was d/ced, pt was maintained on cefepime, but BUN and Cr continued to rise.
Cr had elevated from baseline 1.5 to 1.9.
Etiology was attributed to sepsis, hypotension with low renal perfusion, CHF exacerbation.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for dialysis catheter placement and to be assessed for need for emergent dialysis for elevated BUN and Cr.

# Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has been chronically vented due to an unknown etiology.
CXR shows moderate bilateral pleural effusions, which are likely due to pulmonary edema from renal failure.
Her pleural effusions were not tapped because the patient was clinically doing so well and did not have any signs of sepsis.
# Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, B. cepacia pna: Followup of the [**Hospital 100**] Rehab sputum cultures showed Enterobacter, pseudomonas, and B. cepacia in cultures.
Patient developed ATN due to gentamicin, so she was kept on Cefepime for a total 14 day course.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: The etiology of the patient's acute renal failure is likely acute tubular necrosis from gentamicin-induced nephropathy.
Pt's chronic renal failure is likely due to DM and HTN.
Pt had a tunneled LSC dialysis cath placed on [**4-17**], and she received HD x2, once on [**4-18**], once on [**4-19**].
During admission, it was difficult to assess how different her MS is from her baseline aphasia and dementia.
The likely etiology of her altered mental status is her baseline dementia.
# UTI: Urine culture shows 1+ gram positive bacteria, likely alpha-streptococcus or lactobacillus.
The pt has a history of VRE UTIs, so this urine culture will need to be followed up for characterization and sensitivities, and to make sure that no further organisms appear in the culture.
# AFIB with intermittent RVR and St. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1291**]: Patient is currently on no rate control, no rhythm control, and her anticoagulation is currently with heparin gtt as a bridge to coumadin anticoagulation.
# Anemia: Anemia of chronic disease.
# History of CVA: Pt will be kept on coumadin for [**Hospital1 1291**] and AFIB, but not on ASA or plavix for history of GIB and also because of spontaneous hematomas into muscle.
# GERD: Patient has history of GIB requiring hospitalization, and was kept on Lansoprazole per NGT/PO 30 qd.
# History of primary biliary cirrhosis and gallstones: Stable.
# History of depression and post partum psychosis: Risperdone and prozac were held given unresponsiveness and desire to decrease mediaction interactions.
