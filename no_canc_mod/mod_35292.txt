Admission Date:  [**2104-9-24**]              Discharge Date:   [**2104-10-7**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Celebrex / Plaquenil / Sulfa (Sulfonamides)  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular pacemaker upgrade Trans-esophageal Echocardiogram Cardioversion EGD (Esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy) Colonoscopy   History of Present Illness: 83yo M with h/o HTN, DLP, CHF, A fib s/p permanent pacemaker (4/'[**04**]), anterior MI s/p CABG ([**2084**]), AAA with multiple repairs, CVA presents with shortness of breath.
Patient's cardiac history dates back to [**2084**] when he developed chest pain and was found to have an anterior MI.
He received a CABG in [**2084**] and has been chest pain free since then.
Patient first experienced shortness of breath on exertion about five years ago, when he was placed on Lasix with adequate management of his symptoms until recently.
Patient's most recent symptoms became apparent beginning in [**2104-5-6**] when he began to experience progressive episodes of shortness of breath and fatigue.
Workup for the stroke revealed that the patient was in atrial fibrillation, and patient was placed on Coumadin.
He began experiencing worsening dyspnea on exertion and had multiple medication adjustments of his HF regimen with suboptimal response.
Patient was also subsequently cardioverted in [**2104-6-5**] for continued dyspnea on exertion.
Patient reported worsening of dyspnea following placement of ICD, with PND, orthopnea which was minimally relieved when sitting up in a chair at night, inability to sleep due to shortness of breath.
Patient's activity tolerance also decompensated from being able to walk and play golf without shortness of breath in [**2104-5-6**] to his current state, where he becomes dyspneic at rest.
Patient also reports that he began to experience hemoptysis of dark red sputum in the past two weeks.
He has noticed a bloated abdomen with nausea and feelings of fullness for the past 4 months as well.
Patient denies chest pain, but reports that he experienced a mild tightness in his chest with the episodes of dyspnea.
Lasix was reinitiated and stopped several times in an attempt to prevent hypotension while treating symptoms of dyspnea.
Patient presented and was admitted to Upper [**Hospital 2748**] [**Hospital **] Hospital [**9-21**] for continued worsening symptoms, and was believed to be "profoundly azotemic."
During his hospital stay at the OSH 2 days prior to presentation at [**Hospital1 18**], per family, patient developed hypothermia of 90 degrees F. Family reports that patient was wrapped in multiple blankets at the hospital, and his temperature increased to 92 degrees F. .
An echo obtained [**9-23**] at OSH showed worsened MR (3+) with worsened EF ~15%.
On presentation, he was mildly dyspneic on 3L O2 NC with sats in the low 90's.
However, patient reported that he felt his breathing was improved.
He has remained asymptomatic of chest pain since admission, and had one episode of dyspnea and drops of sats into 80's following bedside TTE, which resolved following elevation of the head of the bed and increase of oxygen to 4L.

CXR on Admission [**2104-9-24**]: There is no comparison available.
The lung volumes are low and show bilateral blunting of costophrenic sinus and increase in interstitial structures that have fibrotic appearance.
There are no signs of additional pneumonia and no signs suggestive of overhydration.
Color-flow imaging of the interatrial septum raises the suspicion of an atrial septal defect, but this could not be confirmed on the basis of this study.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
[**Month/Day/Year **] to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Severe pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe global biventricular systolic dysfunction.
Severe mitral regurgitation, [**Month/Day/Year 1192**] tricuspipd regurgitation.
Possible atrial septal defect.
Findings consistent with pulmonary fibrosis, which can be due to chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
Superimposed ground-glass opacities can be seen in the setting of pulmonary hemorrhage, which would be consistent with given history of hemoptysis.
Pulmonary infection cannot be excluded.
Amiodarone toxicity can present with similar imaging findings and can be considered if patient was treated with amiodarone.
FDG-PET can be non-conclusive in the setting of surrounding ground-glass opacities.
Basal bronchiectasis, which can be seen in the setting of chronic aspiration.
No evidence of CHF.
Evidence for mild interstitial edema persists.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is an 83 year old male with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with newly further depressed ejection fraction, severe mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation status post failed cardioversion in [**2104-6-5**], status-post ICD/pace-maker, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of dypsnea and his cardiac problems.
Patient arrived on the floor and was very dyspneic with minimal exertion.
He was also noted to have mild hemoptysis.
Hospital course is as followed by system:  #) Congestive heart failure, history of ischemic cardiomyopathy: Per report from patient's outside hospital, an echocardiogram was completed prior to transfer that demonstrated a worsened ejection fraction of 15%, with severe mitral regurgitation (as compared to echocardiogram from [**2104-6-5**] where his EF was approximately 30% and MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**]).
On exam, he appeared fluid overloaded with rales bilaterally and elevated JVP.
Hydralazine was added for afterload reduction as well given his severe mitral regurgitation.
The next day, patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit for further monitoring and possible Swanz placment given that he was still very dyspneic with minimal exertion (eg moving in bed) and possible ionotropic support for diuresis.
Because of some low blood pressures in hospital his Toprol XL was restarted at half his dose (25mg [**2-6**] tab daily) His hydralazine was restarted.
An ace-inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) **] was not started due to his renal function, which improved but continued to be variable.
His digoxin was stopped given his variable renal function and decompensated failure at time of admission.
He has an ICD in place for primary prevention given his low ejection fraction.
He is on anticoagulation for that as well as his atrial fibrillation and history of CVA.
If patient continues to have further symptoms from his mitral regurgitation, mitral valve replacement might be a consideration, however that was no pursued during this admission given the improvement in his symptoms with medical therapy and his multiple other co-morbidities.
#) Gastrointestinal bleed: On [**2104-9-28**] the patient developed three episodes of bloody stools which were maroon in color mixed with a significant quantity of stool.
He did not have any subsequent bowel movements or hematochezia, and was asymptomatic apart from minimal dizziness following the bowel movements.
Given concern for acute gastrointestinal bleeding from either an upper or lower source, patient's anti-coagulation was held (he had been on a heparin drip after his INR was <2.0); his diuresis and beta-blocker were temporarily stopped.
There was some erosion and friability of the gastric mucosa, however no bleeding was located.
Biopsies of the gastric mucosa and h. pylori serologies were pending at time of discharge and should be followed up.
The prior bleeding was felt to likely be due to gastritis or an ulcer, which had resolved.
He had no further episodes of bleeding and his hematocrit remained stable.
#) Coronary artery disease: Patient has ischemic cardiomyopathy as evidenced by echocardiogram, and is status post CABG for a myocardial infarction in [**2084**].
During his stay, he had no symptoms concerning for acute coronary syndrone.
He was continued on his aspirin once he had no evidence of bleeding, as well as metoprolol and his statin.
#) Rhythm: Patient has a Pacemaker/ICD in place for history of atrial fibrillation and for primary prevention given his low ejection fraction.
He had a few episodes of NSVT (less than 10 beats) at the time of his prep for his colonoscopy, with accompanying electrolyte distrubances, which were felt to be the cause.
He had no further episodes once his electrolyte abnormalities resolved.
He was started on an amiodarone load to prevent recurrance of atrial fibrillation.
His anticoagulation was continued for his history of atrial fibrillation.
It was felt that he likely had acute tubular necrosis from the contrast given to the patient for a CTA done prior to his transfer, coupled with his low flow state due to his decompensated congestive heart failure.
It was felt that was likely secondary to pulmonary edema and subsequent pulmonary vascular dilation in the setting of supratherapeutic INR.
His outside imaging, including the CTA of this chest was reviewed, and a repeat CAT scan without contrast was obtained after diuresis to rule out any signs of malignancy, given his long tobacco use history and asbestosis exposure.
No large lesions were seen, however "several noncalcified pulmonary nodules, largest measuring 10 mm" were reported.
The radiology report notes that a FDG-PET can be non-conclusive in the setting of surrounding ground-glass opacities.
#) Interstitial Pulmonary Fibrosis: No acute issues.
#) Anemia: Patient has anemia, which may be due to combination of renal insufficiency and heart failure.
His work up for gastrointestinal bleeding is as noted above.
#) HTN: Patient's blood pressure has been in low 100's and high 90's since admission, likely due to his heart failure.
He had no problems with hypertension during his stay, and his blood pressure actually remained on the low side, without symptoms.
#) Possible Sleep Apnea: Consider assessment after patient's acute cardiac issues have resolved.
#) Urinary tract infection: Patient was noted to have an urine analysis consistent with infection.
He had had a foley in place to monitor diuresis and due to his severe dyspnea with any exertion.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for further management of your heart failure, respiratory distress, and atrial fibrillation.
You were treated with several medications.
You also underwent an upper endoscopy and colonoscopy to ensure you had no active gastrointestinal bleeding.
You will need to have your coumadin level (INR) followed closely (once a week until your amiodarone dose is stable) because of the effect amiodarone has on coumadin levels.
