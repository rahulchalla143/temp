Admission Date:  [**2169-6-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-6-20**]   Service: SURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2534**] Chief Complaint: flank pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none   History of Present Illness: 89 yr-old woman with left flank pain and hematoma s/p fall backward onto chair ([**6-12**]), injuring L flank causing splenic lac.
Pt initially felt OK, but developed pain, nausea and hematoma on back & dtr brought her to [**Name (NI) **] day after fall ([**6-13**]).
She was transferred from [**Month/Year (2) **] today ([**6-15**]) for management of large splenic hematoma.
Intraventricular conduction delay of right bundle-branch block type.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Mediastinal fullness in the region of the ascending aorta right lower paratracheal region could be due to vascular distention alone but central adenopathy should be considered.
Mild left basal atelectasis and possible mild interstitial abnormality at the right base are the only focal pulmonary abnormalities.
There is no pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion.
[**6-16**] CXR: Borderline interstitial edema is present and the heart size though normal has increased while mediastinal vasculature is mildly distended, but the major change since [**6-15**] is a worsening of left lower lobe atelectasis which is probably responsible for hypoxia.
[**6-17**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-16**], there is again mild prominence of vascular markings consistent with slight elevation in pulmonary venous pressure.
Increased opacification persists at the left base consistent with some combination of atelectasis and effusion.
Little overall change  [**6-17**] B/L LENI: No evidence of DVT of bilateral lower extremities.
