Admission Date:  [**2164-4-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2164-4-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2083-8-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Tape / Integrilin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**] Chief Complaint: SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization Aortic Valvuloplasty  History of Present Illness: 80 M with h/o CAD s/p CABG and PCI, severe AS, CHF and interstitial lung dz presumed from methyltrexate for polymycitis who presents upon transfer from MVH with decompensated congestive heart failure.
As per outside records and report; patient came to ED after one day history of difficulty breathing requiring him to sleep bolt upright.
He was found to be in pulmonary edema by x-ray and with a corresponding BNP 2280.
Diuresed aggresively but overnight he became hypotensive requiring fluids and started on Dopamine but was unable to tolerate due to ventricular irritability so he was placed on a neo gtt.
Upon transfer: Pt initially SOB now in CCU feels more comfortable.
As per OSH note, Pt endorses several weeks most pronounced the last few days of worsening SOB and orthopnea.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain.
Denies any palpitations, syncope or presyncope   Past Medical History: CAD s/p CABG/PCI  anatomy as follows: (LIMA to LAD, SVG to RCA, SVG to OM) Aortic Stenosis 0.8 ([**10/2163**]) RA/Osteoarthritis hiatal hernia   Social History: Lives with wife and daughter on MVI.
Family History: Father had an MI at 70 y/o.
HEENT: PERRLA, Conjunctiva were pink with no pallor.
CHEST: no wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Diffuse bibasilar rales and decreased BS at bases.
No wheezes CVS: Tachycardic but regular.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness.
The abdomen was soft nontender and nondistended.
Inspection of skin and subcutaneous tissue showed no rash, ulcers, scars, or other lesions.
He was said to have some ST depressions last evening and his troponin was 1.01.
Echocardiogram [**2164-4-4**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left  ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (EF 15-30%) with global hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There is probably moderate to severe aortic stenosis (although data for valve area calculation is technically suboptimal).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system  revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA was a short vessel without significiant disease.
The LAD had an ostial 60% lesion that was unchanged from [**2163**].
The LCx was a nondominant vessel without critical lesions.
Arterial conduit angiography revealed a small but patent LIMA that filled the LAD.
The pulmonary artery pressure was elevated at 40/20 mmHg.
The pulmonary capilary wedge pressure was elevated at 30mmHg.
There was a mean gradient of 28 mmHg across the aortic valve.
There was a 10-15mmHg increase in the  systolic arterial pressure after the procedure.
Severe aortic stenosis.
Successful aortic valvuloplasty.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN, 80 yo M with significant CAD, CHF and AS presented with shortness of breath and decompensated heart failure complicated by hypotension.
# Hypotension: initially cardiogenic, but also likley in septic shock by the end - used neosyn, dobutamine, and vasopressin .
# Respiratory: SOB likely [**3-9**] to both volume overload and pneumonia.
# Renal: decreasing urine op, increasing cr; likely secondary to ischemia/ATN.
# Ischemia: documented CAD and NSTEMI in setting of demand ischemia and worsening systolic function (EF 15-20%).
# Pump: previous [**Month/Day (2) **] with EF50% now with significant worsening of systolic function of unclear etiology probable worsening ischemic disease / AS.
Now with decompensated heart failure and episodes of flash pulm edema - [**Month/Day (2) **] with severe AS, mod-sev MR, and EF 15-20% - cont lasix gtt as tol; titrate to improvement in respiratory status - cont pressers as above .
# AS: contributing to overall cardiac dysfunction but degree of which is unclear - [**Name (NI) **] shows EF 15-20% - supportive care .
