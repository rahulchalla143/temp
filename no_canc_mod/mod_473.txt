Patient was thought to be volume depleted and given total 1.5 L fluid however his BP remained low.
Hct is stable, no fevers or leukocytosis.
Has not had BM for several days.
Patient reports increasing abdominal distension, denies dysuria, difficulty with urination.
He was transferred to the CCU team for further management of his hypotension and ARF   Past Medical History: 1 non ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy w/ EF 20% Echo [**7-4**] EF 20% left ventricular ejection fraction is slightly increased; the tricuspid regurgitation is also increased.
2 Chronic atrial fibrillation on coumadin 3 Diabetes type 2 on insulin 4 Hyperlipidemia 5 Gout 6 Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Social History: No tobacco.
Family History: No family history of heart disease.
ECG: atrial fib, low voltage, no acute ST/T wave changes .
Slightly echogenic kidneys, suggesting medical renal disease.
No suggestion of renal artery stenosis.
Slightly elevated resistive indices may be related to medical renal disease.
KUB ([**2175-8-31**]): No evidence of obstruction.
CXR ([**2175-8-30**]): mild CHF .

NYHA Class III CHF, severe systolic dysfunction with EF of 15-20%.
He received some fluid resucitation on the floor after the elective surgery at the time of hypotension, but was unresponsive to fluid resuscitation, and with poor UO (5cc/hr).
Likely worsening cardiac output with poor renal perfusion.
We started him on dopamine gtt to increase his renal perfusion and held beta-blocker, [**Last Name (un) **], and lasix (given rising Cr).
Chronic A.fib with intermittent RVR, rate up to 140s prior to transfer to CCU, has been off coumadin prior to surgery.
He had two 10-11 beats of NSVT on telemetry while in the hospital, but completely asymptomatic at the time, most likely from his congestive heart failure.
dilated cardiomyopathy - followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**].
Unclear etiology, very rapid rise in Cr on the floor post elective hernia repair, sodium avid by urine lytes (Na <10, FUrea 4%) suggesting severe prerenal state.
He was started on dopamine gTT to help renal profusion and hypotension intially.
Initally UA at the time of transfer to CCU showed evidence of UTI, we started him on Cipro, but subsequent UA and urine Cx (no growth to date) not suggestive of UTI, so Cipro was d/c'ed.
Patient has been off coumadin prior to surgery, renal u/s showed echogenic kidney suggesting medical renal disease, no evidence of renal arteries stenosis, unable to evaluate renal vein thrombosis.
Likely hypervolemic hyponatremia in setting of CHF.
Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
RISS for tight control.
10 LFT initially slightly elevated, likely back up congestion from his CHF exacerbation.
continued monitored his LFTs, which started trending down once hypotension and ARF resolved.
no hematoma, drainage, or signs of infection at the incision site.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: elective right inguinal hernia repair elective hernia repair hypotension after surgery Acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency dilated cardiomyopathy .
Secondary diagnosis Chronic atrial fibrillation on coumadin Diabetes type 2 on insulin Hyperlipidemia Gout Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Discharge Instructions: If you experience any chest pain, SOB, fever, or any other serious medical conditions, please go to the emergency room immediately.
You had a 10-11 beats of NSVT on telemetry while in the hospital, most likely from you congestive heart failure.
We started you on Digoxin 0.125mg for your congestive heart failure, please check your digoxin level at your PCP regularly, and if you experience any palpitation or slow heart rate, Chest pain, Shortness of breath, pleases seek medical attention immediately .
