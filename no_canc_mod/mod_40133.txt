Postmenopausal bleeding status post dilation and     curettage.
Congestive heart failure.
Postoperative CRFA endometritis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 53-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, chronic hypertension, and congestive heart failure, who presented originally with postmenopausal bleeding x1 episode.
The decision was made to do a D and C to rule out malignancy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease, CHF with a ejection fraction of 55% on a [**2192-3-28**] echo, insulin dependent diabetes, atypical chest pain with a negative work up and a negative MIBI on [**2192-3-28**], asthma, sleep apnea, anemia, lower extremity edema, GERD, and a PE in [**2188-9-28**] requiring 12 months of Coumadin anticoagulation, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, migraines, colon polyps, depression, hypercholesterolemia.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted on [**11-20**] for an outpatient procedure of a dilation and curettage for postmenopausal bleeding.
However, during the procedure the patient was noted to have dis-complete ventilating by anesthesia.
The hysteroscopy portion was aborted and the patient was too unstable to extubate, although intraoperative chest x-ray was consistent with pulmonary edema that was thought to be due to her CHF.
She was brought to the ICU for diuresis and ventilation weaning.
A chest x-ray done 4 hours after the initial chest x-ray done intraoperatively showed improvement of the pulmonary edema after IV Lasix.
Cardiac: Given the flash pulmonary edema, cardiac enzymes were cycled x3 and were all negative for any evidence of a troponin leak.
An EKG was noted to have a right bundle branch block, but had been noted at a preoperative EKG.
She was started on her home regimen of hypertensive medications.
Asthma: She was started on her home regimen of Albuterol inhaler, had noticed some productive cough, and this was sent off for cultures.
However, as noted, the chest x-ray that was done after diuresis did not show any evidence of infiltrates suggestive of pneumonia.
Postoperative fever: She spiked to 101.3 on postoperative day #0, and given the chest x-ray with no evidence of infiltrates beyond pulmonary edema, as well as a negative UA, it was felt this was most likely consistent with endometritis.
She will follow up closely with her primary care physicians, as well as her respective specialists.
She will also use extra strength Tylenol at home for pain control, as ibuprofen causes gastritis.
