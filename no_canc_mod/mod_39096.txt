Pertinent Results: [**2194-7-21**] ECG: Sinus rhythm with variable Wenckebach periodicity and P-R interval prolongation.
Precordial ST segment depression is new.
Preserved global left ventricular function.
Moderate functional mitral stenosis from severe mitral annular calcification.
At least mild mitral regurgitation.
At least mild pulmonary hypertension.
Mild aortic stenosis.
There is moderate cardiomegaly.
Bibasilar atelectasis is noted in the setting of low lung volumes.
There is no effusion or pneumothorax.
There is minimal vascular engorgement without overt pulmonary edema.
Normal caliber ascending thoracic aorta heavily calcified at the annulus, with a gap in the calcification of the anterior aortic wall.
Possible pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Hemodynamic significance of the aortic valvular calcification is indeterminate.
2.5-cm right adrenal nodule, not fully evaluated by this examination.
Small central calcifications in both kidneys could be vascular or papillary stones.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There are simple atheroma in the aortic root.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2).
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
LV function is preserved at>55% Mitral and Aortic regurgitation are similar to prebypass.
Bilateral pleural effusions also seem to be improved.
No evidence of pneumothorax.

She was found to have severe coronary artery disease and intra aortic balloon pump was placed due to disease.
Her preoperative workup included Chest CT to evaluate aortic calcification and echocardiogram.
Post operatively she was transferred to the intensive care unit for post operative management.
She did have some acute perioperative respiratory insufficiency with bibasilar effusions and RLL collapse which resolved following bronchoscopy.
Narcotics were minimized and confusion improved.
EP was consulted for second degree AV block and beta blockade was gently titrated as tolerated.
Chest tubes were discontinued without complication.
The patient discontinued her atrial pacing wires on [**2194-7-30**] without incident.
She continued to have second degree heartblock (Wenckebach) as well as junctional rhythm with pauses.
Antibiotics should continue for 10 days after discharge for multiple erythematous incisions.
