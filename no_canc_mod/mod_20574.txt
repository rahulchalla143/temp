Per OSH records, he was intially thought to have a brainstem stroke.
On [**2138-2-3**] (at rehab) the patient became increasingly somnolent and was started on ciprofloxacin for presumed UTI.
An EGD was performed and showed severe portal gastropathy with active oozing.
24 hours later a repeat EGD showed improvement in the bleeding but continued severe portal hypertensive gastropathy.
The plan was to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of his severe portal gastropathy and for further assessment.
Denies chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain.
+ Chronic back pain.

No discrete focal lesions are seen; however, evaluation is markedly limited in the presence of fatty infiltration/coarsened echotexture.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation seen.
IMPRESSION: Patent main portal vein, with limited visualization of the intrahepatic vasculature.
Sequela of cirrhosis as evidenced by splenomegaly and coarsened hepatic echotexture.
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, mass effect, hydrocephalus or acute major vascular territorial infarction.
There are post-surgical changes of the sinuses.
Metallic surgical material is present along the posterior wall of the right maxillary sinus.
There is moderate mucosal thickening of the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses.
Right sphenoid sinus air cells opacified.
Mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities remain clear.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Post-surgical changes and mucosal thickening of the paranasal sinuses  [**2137-2-21**] HEAD / NECK CTA The CT angiography of the head demonstrates bilateral normal flow within the arteries of anterior and posterior circulation.
No vascular occlusion, stenosis, or an aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size is seen.
No abnormal vascular structures seen.
Incidentally noted is a small infundibulum at the origin of left posterior communicating artery.
No acute abnormalities on head CT or change since the previous study.
No significant abnormalities on CTA of the head.
No vascular occlusion or high-grade stenosis seen.
Incidental small infundibulum at the origin of left posterior communicating artery.
[**2137-2-24**] EEG This is an abnormal 24-hour video EEG telemetry in the waking and sleeping states due to the electrographic seizures noted with rhythmic [**2-17**] Hz blunted sharp and slow wave discharges seen particularly over the bilateral parasagittal regions with occasional extension into the left temporal lobe.
There were also intermittent spike and slow wave discharges, particularly in the bilateral parasagittal regions.
There was no clear electrographic correlate for these seizures.
This recording, thus, demonstrates non-convulsive status epilepticus which is intermittent throughout the recording.
The parasagittal and occasionally left temporal sharp discharges may suggest either a  generalized abnormality or multiple potential foci of epileptogenesis.
Brief Hospital Course: CIRRHOSIS & PORTAL HYPERTENSIVE GASTROPATHY The patient had a clinical diagnosis of cirrhosis, likely alcohol and non-alcohol induced steatosis, complicated by portal gastropathy with a history of transfusion support, no esophageal varices, no significant ascites, and no former diagnosis of encephalopathy.
He had an upper endoscopy this admission which confirmed no esophageal varices, and noted portal hypertensive gastropathy but no GAVE.
He had a neurologic event that was not fully characterized at an outside/referring hospital that considered to be a brainstem stroke, but when he recovered fully, this was thought to be related to hepatic encephalopathy.
He clinically did not appear to be encephalopathic while in our hospital, never having the sign of asterixis.
At times, he did appear to be speech arresting and having delayed responsivenes or inappropriate answers to questions, but it was never classic for hepatic encephalopathy as he would, in the course of the same visit/examination, be able to clearly answer orientation questions and perform adequately on mental status examination.
On acceptance to our hospital, he was evaluated for insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.
However, he had a clinical seizure the day prior to scheduled TIPS, and the plan was aborted pending further characterization of his seizure disorder.
At time of discharge, given concern that his seizure disorder could be an atypical manifestation of hepatic encephalopathy, TIPS was indefinitely postponed.
However, it was felt that it could be entirely possible that they are completely unrelated as he had no other signs or symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy including asterixis or decreased orientation or confusion when he was not in a post-ictal state.
He was started on iron supplementation 325mg PO TID after his iron studies showed that he was iron deficient.
SEIZURE DISORDER / EPILEPSY The patient developed a new seizure disorder while in the hospital; further review of his history suggests that the patient's initial chief complaint in [**Month (only) 404**] prior to presenting to the hospital which ultimately referred him here was a seizure.
The patient was witnessed to have two generalized tonic clonic seizures on the hospital floor, each self-limited lasting approximately one minute, with a [**3-20**] minute post-ictal period.
He was loaded on keppra given his hepatic disease, and transferred to the intensive care unit for further EEG monitoring.
This initial monitoring revealed no epileptiform activity, only nonspecific slowing.
Head CT at this time was unrevealing for any mass lesions or old infarctions.
The patient had no clear visual field deficit and visual acuity was grossly normal.
Neurology saw the patient, and recommended a stat head CTA be performed to rule out vertebrobasilar insufficiency, which was normal.
One to two days later, he again developed generalized tonic-clonic seizure activity that was witnessed by the medical housestaff team and the neurology attending.
The patient clinically had a left sided focus.
He did not have further seizure activity.
ANXIETY The patient had a history of OCD/generalized anxiety, and this was unfortunately severely exacerbated by the keppra.
He grew E. coli and was treated with fluoroquinolone but switched to bactrim to complete his 7 day course given that fluoroquinolones can lower the seizure threshold.
He did not have his home mask and felt uncomfortable, and unfortunately generally felt tired throughout the day.
Simethicone 80 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for abdominal discomfort or gas pain.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 puffs Inhalation four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.

You had clinical seizures while hospitalized and were started on an two anti-seizure drugs called Keppra and Dilantin while here.
You had an upper endoscopy which showed a slow bleed from the high pressures in the veins around your stomach.
Because of the seizure disorder, you did not have a TIPS procedure.
For Depression and anxiety, you are still on LEXAPRO, but the other medications were discontinued, including CYMBALTA and WELLBUTRIN.
RETURN to hospital if you develop any signs of altered mental status/confusion/encephalopathy, fever, chills, or other concerning symptoms.
If you have a seizure lasting more than five minutes or that results in any injury, return to the hospital.
For seizure lasting less than five minutes, please call your neurologist to discuss and be seen in clinic.
If you need a Hepatologist, you can schedule an appointment in the [**Hospital1 18**] liver center at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 24157**]  Please schedule an appointment to be seen by a Neurologist or Epilepsy specialist.
