Admission Date:  [**2145-10-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-10-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2078-9-2**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Nicotinic Acid  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14385**] Chief Complaint: PEA arrest  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 67yo female with hx of HTN, IgA nephropathy, chronic sinusitis, s/p R THR, migraine headaches, ESRD on HD for the past 6 years and CHF/diastolic dysfunction, who was doing well prior to dialysis on [**10-6**] and then per report 30min into dialysis she became pulseless, apnec and hypotensive with SBP in 60s.
Patient received chest compressions and was bagged- EMS arrived and AED inticated sinus tach at 140 with no pulses appreciated.
The patient got 800cc NS and SBP increased to 80 and HR decreased to 80s with positive carotid pulses.
The patient was intubated secondary to decreased respiratory rate and airway protection.
On arrival in the ER, she was noted to be in sinus tach- and hypotensive (BP not recorded) and received an additional 2L NS with SBP inc to 100-110- then decreased to 90 systolic.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2145-10-9**]):       MODERATE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
MODERATE GROWTH.
Allowing for this, there is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of the normally midline structures.
Ventricles and sulci are slightly prominent but symmetric, compatible with involutional change.
There is no evidence of an acute major vascular territorial infarction.
There is mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air cells.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
[**10-7**] ECHO: Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is moderate-to-severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 30 percent).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2145-10-6**] CT OF THE CHEST:  FINDINGS: The examination is technically suboptimal due to difficulties with bolus timing.
Allowing for this, visualized pulmonary arterial tree does not demonstrate any filling defects indicative of pulmonary embolus to the level of the first order segmental pulmonary arteries bilaterally.
There is a small amount of pericardial fluid.
Scattered coronary artery calcifications are noted as well.
Multiple prominent pretracheal lymph nodes are identified.
In addition, there is thickening of the septal lines, consistent with volume overload.
Multiple healed right sided posterior rib fractures are noted.
No evidence of central or first order segmental pulmonary embolus.
Small pericardial effusion.
Bibasilar consolidation.
Volume overload.
EKG not suggestive of MI as no Q waves or ST changes.
Elevated enzymes were attributed to myocardial injury from CPR.
An ECHO was performed that showed significant valvular disease, LV hypokinesis with an EF of 30%.
At the time of discharge the patient had no complaints of chest pain, was in NSR on telemetry.
Hypotension: The patient was agressively resuscitated and had no further episodes of hypotension after being weaned off the levophed.
The initial cause of her hypotension was likely [**12-21**] to her PEA arrest that was complicated by her severe underlying cardiac disease.
Respiratory failure: Initially related to her PEA arrest.
ESRD: The patient was quiet fluid overloaded on initial presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] [**12-21**] not completing dialysis, hypotension with agressive fluid resuscitation.
NEURO: altered mental status.
After extubation, the patient was confused and somewhat delirious.
Her AMS may be related to initial hypoxia due to PEA arrest.
She had no electrolyte abnormality or source of infection not being treated.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: PEA arrest ESRD on HD IgA nephrop chronic sinusitis anemia on epogen CHF diastolic dysfxn mod-sev AS s/p R THR migraines DM2 hypercholesterolemia Wegner's granulomastosis   Discharge Condition: stable  Discharge Instructions: Transfer to [**Hospital1 112**]  Followup Instructions: Follow up with your primary physician and cardiologist.
