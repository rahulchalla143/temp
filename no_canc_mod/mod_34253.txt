Modest ST-T wave changes are non-specific.
Since the previous tracing of [**2142-10-5**] sinus tachycardia rate is faster and modest ST-T wave changes are present.
There is persistent bilateral lung opacities worrisome for pneumonia.
There is no significant change from prior study.
There is a small right pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
Right posterior upper rib fractures are again noted.
Bilateral ground-glass opacities, new pneumatoceles, focal areas of atelectais-consolidation, Chronic mild upper lobe bronchiectasis, and focal air trapping as described above.
Differential diagnosis is broad and includes infectious causes such as atypical viral/bacterial pneumonia including PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] edema secondary to drug reaction, chronic changes secondary to patient's known hypogammaglobulinemia, or collagen vascular disease such as goodpasture's syndrome.
Chronic mild upper lobe bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening may be secondary to asthma or patient's known hypogammaglobulinemia.
New pneumatoceles may be sequale of prior infection or active infection such as PCP.
Marked osteopenia with multiple stable vertebral body compression fractures and old rib fractures.
Discharge labs:   Brief Hospital Course: 25 year old female with past medical history of asthma complicated by multiple intubations and IV drug abuse complicated by septic shock and septic arthritis.
She was sent from [**Hospital1 **] for ED evaluation of pneumonia after her oxygen saturation was noted to be low.
Hypoxia, fevers:  She was found to have possible multifocal pneumonia on CXR, she was initially treated broadly with Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Azithromycin, which was then narrowed to Levofloxacin and Ceftriaxone and changed to Levofloxacin and Cefpodoxime before dischage (planned last day [**1-15**]).
She had a CT chest which showed ground glass opacities bilaterally possibly reflecting infection vs drug-induced lung injury.
She was treated with nebulizer treatments and a short course of prednisone for possible contribution of her underlying asthma.
Patient was originally started on Tamiflu but then tested negative for influenza and her tamiflu was stopped.
Somnolence:  She had somnolence initially on presentation that was thought to be related to a toxic ingestion given her past history of drug abuse in conjunction with verbal report from ED that patient went to restroom and came back to ED room much more somnolent.
Serum and urine tox screen were unrevealing, and she had no further episodes.
Asthma:  Patient had suboptimal air movement at presentation to the ICU with inspiratory and expiratory wheezing and some slight tachypnea.
It seemed that the patient's chronic respiratory sxs might not be due to asthma (overall low lung volumes and does not require chronic steroids like she has as a child) but to other chronic lung disease.
Knee pain: Patient had a left knee arthrocentesis on [**1-11**] which showed 175/uL WBCs with 95%PMNs.
Gram stain had no PMS and no organisms.
She had no warmth and tenderness on exam.
She had a Code Purple called for aggressive and agitated behavior and was given Ativan and Seroquel with good effect.
