INDICATION: Evaluate for pleural effusion following mitral valve surgery.
Right internal jugular vascular sheath has been removed and a right PICC line has been placed with tip terminating in the upper superior vena cava.
Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion has decreased in size, and small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
Interstitial edema has nearly resolved.
IMPRESSION: Resolving interstitial edema and improving right pleural effusion.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Abnormal septal motion/position.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic valve stenosis is seen.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Based on [**2145**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a high risk (prophylaxis strongly recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data."

# CAD: Pt with known CAD s/p 3VD s/p CABG.
Found to have troponin leak in setting of CHF and renal failure.
Patient remained chest pain free during hospitalization.
# PUMP: volume overloaded on admission, and diuresed.
She had episodes post op of overload requiring reintubation once and mask ventilation the second time.
She has had no further episodes and continues to be diuresised aggressively and blood pressure control goal SBP <125.
#Complete heart block - after receiving lopressor went into complete heart block that did not resolving requiring insertion of permanent pacemaker.
# VALVES:  severe mitral degenerative dz with MS and MR. [**Last Name (Titles) 8751**] 1.0-1.5cm2 on echo (1.3cm2 on cath).
Mitral disease felt to be contributing to recurrent bouts of CHF requiring hospitalization.
She had a panorex film and and dental consult for pre-operative assessment.
There was concern that she also had a lesion on her right hand middle finger and Rheumatology was consulted.
# PNA: Felt to contribute to her respiratory failure and MICU hospitalization.
Resolved leukocytosis, now afebrile and breathing comfortably on room air.
# Acute on CRI:  recent baseline 1.1 to 1.3.
