The patient was found to have a witnessed seizure in bed at homeless shelter.
He was taken to [**Hospital1 8**] where a CT showed bleed and he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation.
CT scan was repeated showing an intraparenchymal bleed L>R and epidural bleed of R occipital region.
Past Medical History: Diastolic CHF Chronic Pleural Effusions s/p VATS and decortication [**10-29**] COPD EtOH abuse with history of withdrawal seizures Pulmonary HTN Chronic Atrial Fibrillation Adenocarcinoma of the Esophagus s/p chemotherapy and radiation Depression OSA GERD   Social History: Per OSH DC summary - Pt is homeless and lives in a shelter in [**Hospital1 8**].
Drinks 1pt vodka daily  Family History: Unable to obtain  Physical Exam: Vitals: Tm:98 Tc:95.6 BP: 148/100 P: 97 R: 18 O2: 98% on RA General: Unkempt, alert/oriented to time, place, and person, Lying on bed, uncooperative HEENT: Sclera anicteric, pupils slightly sluggish but reactive, MMM, oropharynx with some erythema, poor dentition, pink complexion Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, patient refusing to wear C-collar so not in place, 3cm round soft tissue mass on right side of neck, not TTP, soft.
Lungs: Decreased BS at bases, no wheezes appreciated CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: soft, non-tender, no appreciable organomegaly, no rebound or guarding Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema  Pertinent Results: [**2184-10-20**] Na 129    Cl 93  BUN 8   Glc 94  K 4.5  HC03 24   Cr 0.6 Phenytoin: 8.7; most recent albumin 3.4; corrected phenytoin is 11.1  WBC 4.5   Plts 579 Hct 28.1   [**2184-9-24**] CT Head with reconstruction IMPRESSION: 1.
The appearances of the right posterior fossa extra-axial most likely an epidural hematoma and bilateral frontal and left temporal subarachnoid blood as well as intraparenchymal blood in the left frontal lobe has not changed.
Chronic infarcts are again visualized.
Normal CT angiography of the head for stenosis or occlusion.
However, given the presence of epidural hematoma and fracture in the right occipital bone evaluation of right transverse sinus may be required but could not be evaluated on the current study.
Multilevel degenerative changes of the spine as described above with no acute spinal fracture.
Centrilobular emphysema.
Right sided subcutaneous cystic lesion, perhaps a sebaceous cyst.
Dense retrocardiac consolidation could represent atelectasis or perhaps aspiration.
Small amount of new hemorrage layering along the tentorium.
New sinus disease since recent comparison with air-fluid level suggesting acute sinusitis.
Right occipital fracture with no interval growth of a presumed venous epidural hematoma.
Small amount of hemorrhage layering within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles without appreciable change to the ventricular appearence.
ATTENDING NOTE: Small amount of new posterior falx/tentorium SDH described above could just be due to redistribution and is likely not a new finding.
The foreign body was successfully removed using [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] net  Excavated Lesions A large nearly circumferential ulcer was found in the lower third of the esophagus at the site of coin impaction.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Diffuse erythema and petechiae of the mucosa were noted in the whole stomach.
Impression: Two coins in the lower third of the esophagus (foreign body removal) Ulcer in the lower third of the esophagus Erythema and petechiae in the whole stomach c/w gastritis Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum   Brief Hospital Course: A/P: Pt is a 60yo M with PMH of EtOH abuse admitted with fever, multifocal intraparenchymal hemorrhagic contusions, course complicated by aspiration pneumonia and SIADH  # Traumatic Head Injury with Intraparenchymal bleed and subdural bleed - pt found s/p seizure per report, had mechanism significant enough for occipital frx.
No evidence of lelevated ICP.
Repeat CT Head showed likely stable blood, redistribution, but no new acute bleed.
Will followup with neurosurgery/Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**10-28**] at which time he will also have repeat CT of head (noncontrast) for resolution.
# Cervical spine injury: Pt w/ negative c-spine CT. MRI obtained to eval for ligamentous injury but not useful due to motion artifact.
# Aspiration pneumonia- Retrocardiac opacity on initial CXR was thought most likely aspiration pneumonia, which was treated with a full course of antibiotics.
He continues to have silent aspiration secondary to dysphagia; speech and swallow therapist recommended thickened liquids and soft foods, 1:1 assistance with meals, and aspiration precautions (sitting fully upright to eat, chewing carefully, small bites alternating with sips).
# Chronic Pleural Effusions s/p VATS and decortication - unclear if CXR change from baseline.
# COPD - Reported history of chronic pleural effusions, s/p VATS and decortication, as well, which may explain poor/rhonchorous breath sounds on exam.
# Alcohol withdrawal seizures - Unclear seizure history - pt on depakote as outpatient.
Possible seizure focus related to bleed, although report from OSH indicated pt had seizure event prior to fall with head trauma.
EtOH level negative on presentation,  # Atrial Fibrillation - holding ASA as above, will restart per Neurosurgery recs on/after [**10-21**].
# GERD, esophageal ulcer - increased ppi to [**Hospital1 **], which should be continued until pt sees GI in follow-up in [**Month (only) **] to evaluate for resolution with repeat EGD.
Intracranial hemorrhage 3. occipital fracture 4.
Seizure 5. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 6. diastolic congestive heart failure 7. pulmonary hypertension 8. chronic pleural effusion 9. adenocarcinoma of esophagus s/p chemo and radiation therapy 10.
Aspiration 11. foreign body ingestion with associated esophageal ulceration (foreign bodies removed) Secondary: 1. depression 2. obstructive sleep apnea 3. gastroeshopageal reflux disease   Discharge Condition: alert and oriented.
The CT from [**Hospital1 8**] and [**Hospital1 18**] showed that you have some bleeding in your brain as well as non-displaced fracture in the base of your skull.
The repeated CT of your head showed no additional acute bleed.
You had difficulty swallowing with food going into your airway caused coughs and sputum production.
You were treated with antibiotic for possible aspiration pneumonia.
Series of chest x-ray showed chronic fluid in your lung which has worsened with aspiration.
You experienced low blood pressure and change in mental status in setting of dehydration and low sodium (from [**Date range (1) 80335**], sodium has been stable between 126 and 130).
The nephrologists examined you and recommend additional salt in your diet to help with low sodium.
It is important that you take all the medications as prescribed to prevent further seizure and fall.
Also, you will need to follow up with your primary care nurse practitioners and neurosurgeon for the blood in your brain and the broken skull bone.
An ulcer was seen in the distal esophagus, so you will need to take lansoprazole twice a day for 4 weeks and then have a repeat endoscopy with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4539**] to make sure this is resolving.
If you have shortness of breath, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, severe headache, vision changes or chest pain, please contact your primary care physician or come to emergency room.
