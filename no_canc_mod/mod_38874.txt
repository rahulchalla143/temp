The portal vein shows sluggish flow but is patent.
There is sludge in the gallbladder, but no acute cholecystitis.
No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
IMPRESSION: Sluggish flow but patent portal vein.
CT HEAD [**2173-12-16**] FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or infarction.
The sulci are globally markedly prominent, indicating considerable diffuse cortical atrophy.
No fracture is identified.
There is extensive opacification of the bilateral ethmoid air cells and sphenoidal sinuses.
No acute intracranial process.
Extensive bilateral sinus disease.
Marked diffuse cortical atrophy, unusually severe for the patient's age.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 50 yo male with PMH of hep C and EtOH cirrhosis who presents after being found down with massive hematemesis and initial Hct 10 now s/p 8 units PRBCs, 6 units platelets and 8 units FFP and banding of 17 varices who developed acute hepatitis, respiratory failure and ventilator associated pneumonia.
#Variceal Bleed: Patient had massive hematemesis [**2-17**] variceal bleed with nadir Hgb of 2.8, Hct of 8.8 who underwent EGD with banding and massive transfusion.
Active type and screen was maintained.
The following day Code Blue was called for respiratory/cardiac arrest in this patient (s/p 12 minutes of rescucitation), likely secondary to repeated episode of GI bleed.
a family meeting was held and given lack of therapeutic options, and patient's poor prognosis, family decided to stop supportive measured.
Immediate cause of death was felt to be variceal bleeding and acute renal failure, chief cause of death was cirrhosis.
#Acute respiratory failure- in setting of being found down/hematemesis initially; intubation was prolonged due to ventilator associated pneumonia.
He was extubated, but reintubated  in setting of cardiac arrest due to repeat bleed and aspiration.
#Acute renal failure: likely secondary to shock in setting of initial bleed.
Has had seizures and hallucinations in the past with alcohol withdraw.
Transitional Issues: Family requested no autopsy, and body to be transported to patient's country of origin.
