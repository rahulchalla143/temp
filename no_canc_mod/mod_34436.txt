History of Present Illness: The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting for critical symptomatic congestive heart failure symptoms back in [**2124-1-15**] up in [**Location (un) 5450**], [**Location (un) 3844**].
The patient re-presented with a bout of congestive heart failure and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 78250**] worked the patient up, which showed that all of his vein grafts were occluded.
His mammary artery was patent to the LAD and there was severe native vessel progression as well.
This degree of mitral regurgitation had significantly increased as well between [**Month (only) 1096**] and this point.
The patient was therefore referred for redo coronary artery bypass grafting as well as mitral valve repair or replacement.
Past Medical History: CAD s/p CABGx6 in [**1-/2124**] CVD COPD Hyperlipidemia HTN AAA PNA MI DJD Gout CRI h/o alcohol abuse Renal cell cancer s/p nephrectomy CHF CVD s/p (B) CEA  Social History: Lives with wife in [**Name (NI) **].
Family History: Unremarkable  Physical Exam: 74  112/62  67"  188lbs GEN: WDWN in NAD SKIN: Warm, dry, no clubbing or cyanosis.
EXT:warm, well perfused, no bruits, no varicosities, L GSV harvested Right appears suitable.
Mild peripheral edema NEURO: No focal deficits.
Pertinent Results: [**2124-7-27**] - ECHO Pre Bypass: The left atrium is markedly dilated and elongated.
Color-flow imaging of the interatrial septum raises the suspicion of an atrial septal defect, but this could not be confirmed on the basis of this study.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an inferior basal aneurysm with akinesis of the basal inferior and inferior-septal walls.
There is also severe hypokineis of the entire lateral and remaing portions of the inferior and septal walls, and mild hypokinesis of the anterior and anteroseptal walls.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post Bypass: No change in Biventricular function.
There is a bioprosthetic mitral valve in place, no paravalvular leaks.
The small present left pleural effusion has decreased in size on today's examination.
The pulmonary vasculature is slightly prominent but no definite edema is seen.
Loculated right small to moderate pleural effusion, stable.
Improvement of the small left pleural effusion.
Moderate cardiomegaly.
Complete heart block was noted under his temporary pacemaker and the EP service was consulted.
On postoperative day two, he developed high output from his chest tubes and was reintubated.
He was taken to the operating room where he was re-explored for bleeding and hemostasis was acheived of a bleeding branch of a vein graft.
As it was unlikely his conduction system would recover, the electrophysiology service placed a permenant pacemaker on [**2124-8-1**] without complication.
He was noted to have 3 5 minute episodes of atrial fibrillation, he was switched to a full aspirin.
