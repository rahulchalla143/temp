Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.

ASSESS FOR EPILEPTIC ACTIVITY.
REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]   FINDINGS: ABNORMALITY #1: Frequent generalized bifrontally dominant broad-based sharp discharges.
ABNORMALITY #2: The background was diffusely slow and discontinuous with admixed theta and delta activity reaching maximal for 5-5.5 Hz with no anterior-posterior gradient.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Is not performed due to portable equipment.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and sleep EEG because of frequent generalized bifrontally dominant epileptic discharges indicative of areas of cortical irritability with potential epileptogenicity.
In addition, background activity is diffusely slow and discontinuous suggestive of severe diffuse cerebral dysfunction in this case most likely related to hypoxic brain injury.
Other potential causes include medication effect or toxic or metabolic disturbances.
No electrographic seizures are present.

TECHNIQUE:  MR of the head without contrast.
FINDINGS:  There is no obvious focus of slow diffusion to suggest an acute infarct.
Evaluation for subacute infarcts can be limited on the DWI sequence given the long interval.
There are extensive periventricular and subcortical FLAIR hyperintense foci, some of which are discrete and others are confluent in the frontal and the parietal lobes on both sides.
There is moderate dilation of the lateral and the third ventricles including the temporal horns on both sides.
A few small scattered foci of negative susceptibility in the brain parenchyma scattered in the cerebral hemispheres and a few faint foci in the right cerebellar hemisphere.
The major intracranial arterial flow voids are noted.
The left vertebral artery is markedly diminutive in size.
There is increased signal intensity in the mastoid air cells on both sides from fluid and mucosal thickening.
Slightly increased signal intensity in the right transverse sinus, may relate to slow flow.
There is diffuse increased signal intensity in the paranasal sinuses and the ethmoid and the maxillary sinuses, right more than left and the sphenoid sinus along with fluid in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx related to intubation.
No large area of obvious acute infarct.
FLAIR hyperintense areas in the cerebral white matter, non-specific in appearnace and a few scattered T2 susceptibility foci related to  microhemorrhages as described above.
Diffuse paranasal sinus disease with fluid in the nasopharynx; fluid and mucosal thickening diffusely in the mastoid air cells.
Moderate dilation of the lateral and the third ventricles as described above-?
related to parenchymal volume loss with or without a component of communicating hydrocephalus such as NPH.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr [**Known lastname 83900**] was transferred from cardiologist office to emergency room for evaluation of dyspnea that was progressively worsening at rehab that was thought to be related to pneumonia and COPD exacerbation at rehab.
He had echocardiogram that revealed large pericardial effusion and right ventricular compression.
His creatinine was elevated due to cardiac compromise with acute kidney injury and elevated troponin due to demand ischemia from cardiac strain.
He was on coumadin and received fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K for reversal.
He was treated with IV fluids and levophed for hemodynamic management.
On [**5-14**] he was extubated without any complications and was continued to be diuresed and creatinine continued to improve.
On [**5-15**] he was note for diarrhea and stool was positive for Clostridium dificile, flagyl was started.
He continued to be diuresed but there was noted to be paradoxical breathing at times that was thought to be related to his sternum.
On [**5-18**] EP was consulted due to arrythmia with concern for AV nodal block but was diagnosed with atypical atrial flutter.
On [**5-20**] he underwent a CT scan due to ongoing paradoxical breathing, Plastic surgery was consulted in regards to potential sternal plating or flap coverage due to dehiscence of the sternum.
Additionally due to worsening rashes on skin dermatology was consulted, the left lower extremity was felt to be hyperkeratosis and facial rash was vitiligo but felt to be chronic.
He continued with diuresis, pulmonary exercises and non invasive ventilation at night.
On the night of [**5-22**] he had difficulty breathing while completing respiratory treatment and then became bradycardic with PEA arrest.
He required vasopressors and inotropic support.
He continued treatment for pneumonia, clostridium dificile, and urinary tract infection.
Neurology was consulted he underwent MRI that did not reveal any acute findings and EEG that showed significant slowing which neurology felt he was unlikely to have a meaningful recovery.
Mr.[**Known lastname 83900**] remained unresponsive and without improvement.
The EEG was repeated and showed slowing, likely from anoxic brain injury.
