He reports that he has had a cough which is productive of white sputum which has been very persistent for the past day and did not improve with NyQuil.
The patient reports that he thought he had pneumonia so he came to the ED.
He also reports that he has a tightness in his back, which is C7-T2 area, which he reports is a "tightness" and feels different from the back pain that he had during his presentation during the last hospitalization, which was sharper.
The patient does endorse paryoxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea, but he cannot clarify it is due to discomfort from lying where his neck hurts him or if it is because he feels SOB.
He says he has been compliant with his medications.
He also reports DOE but this is unchanged from his baseline and is felt to be due to his severe MR/TR.
CXR without acute cardiopulmonary process and UA was negative.
Patient given Lasix 20mg IV once and dextromethamorphan, Tessalon Perles, he felt that his cough improved with these interventions.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Probable mild pleural effusion and atelectatic changes at the bases on the left.
The increasing cardiac size with little change in pulmonary vascularity raises the possibility of pericardial effusion  ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**2175-7-25**]: Focused study to assess pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study dated [**2175-7-14**] (images reviewed), the amount of pericardial effusion has increased (previously trivial).

CXR without signs of pneumonia.
Treated with dextromethamorphan-guiafenesin, tessalon perles for symptomatic control and had improvement of symptoms with this.
# Pericardial effusion: the patient has worsening positional back pain, which is potentially consistent with pericarditis, among other etiologies, including MSK.
He has a known pericardial effusion which was considered to be insignificant, he did not undergo pericardiocentesis during the prior hospitalization.
Cardiomegaly has worsened on his CXR (3cm difference), which is concerning for worsening pericardial effusion.
No signs of tamponade--blood pressure stable, no JVD appreciated (pulsus not assessed as patient looked very stable).
Repeat echocardiogram performed and showed that the effusion had increased but was still small.
# Leukocytosis: seen during prior hospitalization and stable from prior hospitalization at 15-20.
The patient's UA was negative, his CXR was not concerning for pna, and bacterial blood and urine cultures were pending at time of discharge.
CHRONIC ISSUES: # CORONARIES:  patient with known CAD in the LAD.
# PUMP: borderline CHF 50-55%, appears euvolemic at this time.
# RHYTHM: paroxysmal afib, on dabigatran.
Rate control on metoprolol succinate and diltiazem, patient does become tachycardic with heart rate to low 100's but remains asymptomatic and will return to atrial fibrillation in the 70-80s.
No cardioversion scheduled because of plan for cardiac surgery next week ([**2175-7-31**]).

It is felt that this cough is most likely just a simple virus.
You have also complained of some back pressure/tightness, and this current pain is not because of your heart.
It is most likely due to a muscle strain because you have been lying down so much recently.
Please note that the following changes have been made to your medications: - NO major changes, however, you may use Tessalon Perles, Dextromethomorphan-guaifenesin (which is Mucinex) as needed for your cough.
