MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2103-4-15**]): No MRSA isolated.
No evidence of neck or floor of mouth infection.
No drainable collection.
Superior mediastinal lymph nodes, increased in size from [**11-9**], [**2102**], chest CT.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: I agree with the above, except that there are prominent level 2 nodes bilaterally.
on the left, the largest node measures 11 mm in short axis, which is above size criteria.
Brief Hospital Course: # Tongue swelling: Upon presentation the patient had no evidence of airway compromise.
CT neck was obtained which was unrevealing for focal collection.
She was admitted to the ICU for airway monitoring and treated with IV prednisone and zyrtec for likely angioedema related to the cefaclor she had been taking.
Anticoagulation was temporarily held given initial concern for subungual hematoma vs. possible AVM.
The swelling decreased dramatically over hours in the setting of this treatment (even while the patient was therapeutic on coumadin, making angioedema more likely) and the patient was transferred to the medical floor.
The patient had trace tongue swelling the following morning and some dusky discoloration thought to be related to resolved microvascular bleeding in the setting of therapeutic INR.
This was listed as an allergy in our system and the patient was instructed to notify all future providers of this reaction to this class of antibiotics.
The patient was instructed to follow up with Allergy as an outpatient by calling the number they had given her, as well as with her PCP the following business day to have her INR checked and her anticoagulation adjusted accordingly.
# H/o PEs related to lupus anticoagulation: The patient's coumadin was held due to initial concern for AVM/bleeding into her tongue.
The coumadin was restarted when her swelling improved and angioedema was thought to be a much more likely cause of her tongue symptoms.
# Superior mediastinal lymph nodes: increased in size compared to previous CT scan in [**11-3**].
EpiPen 0.3 mg/0.3 mL Pen Injector Sig: One (1) injection Intramuscular as needed as needed for difficulty breathing, tongue swelling.
Disp:*2 pens* Refills:*0*  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Angioedema  Secondary: Lupus Hypercoagulability secondary to lupus anticoagulant   Discharge Condition: Alert and oriented, able to ambulate without assistance.
You underwent a CT scan of your neck which did not reveal any noticeable pockets of infection, and were seen by Allergy and Ear Nose and Throat doctors, who felt that your swelling was most likely a form of allergic reaction ("angioedema"), possibly to cefaclor, that may sometimes worsen to the point of compromising breathing.
Given your initial symptoms, a neck CT was done and showed some enlarged lymph nodes which had grown slightly since imaging from last [**Month (only) 359**].
You are being given 2 epi-pens that you should have available for injection in the event that you have an episode of severe allergy or anphylaxis (wheezing, difficult breathing, throat or tongue swelling) in the future.
