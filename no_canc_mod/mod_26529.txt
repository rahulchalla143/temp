Of note, the patient was admitted from [**2110-7-14**] to [**2110-7-16**] for right testicular pain consistent with epididymitis thought to be related to repeated instrumentation of urethra and chronic indwelling catheterization.
His pain was managed with morphine and tylenol.
There is also a note from his Atrius urologist that in the past 2 months he had a 3 mm calculus with R side stent placement, with a planed ureteroscopy in the future.

IMAGING: [**2110-8-21**] @ 0329 - CXR - IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema though no consolidation.
New central venous catheter terminating in the mid SVC.
No evidence of obstruction or toxic megacolon.
Mild colitis involving the cecum.
There is no evidence of pyelonephritis.
New bilateral pleural effusions.
5   Unchanged 1.3 cm left adrenal lesion that is indeterminate by CT size criteria, however, it most likely represents a lipid poor adenoma.
Non-obstructing 2mm right renal calculus.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume overload.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
There are no other interval changes.

>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..   Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 66369**] is an 81M with DMII, chronic indwelling Foley due to urinary retention, cerebral palsy, atrial fibrillation not anti-coagulated presents with septic shock .
# Septic Shock: The patient was aggressively fluid resucitated in the ED and ICU per rivers protocol; he was briefly on norepinephrine in the ED, but had weaned by the time he arrived to the ICU.
U/A findings (reported "pus" in the Foley initially) as well as recent instrumention and stenting in the past 2 months, with what appears per records to be several rounds of UTIs pointed to an etiology of urosepsis.
Of note, CT Abd revealed right ureteral stent, nonspecific perinephric stranding unchanged from [**2110-7-16**].
As such, the patient initially in the ICU was covered with Vancomycin IV, Cefepime IV, Vancomycin PO, and IV Metronidazole to cover potential lung, urine, and colonic srouces, with a plan to wean antibiotics on the floor.
He was subsequently found to have Klebsiella Pneumonia in the blood, and was narrowed to Cefepime IV, Vancomycin PO, and IV Metronidazole.
Urine Cx from OSH grew Klebsiella Pneumonia ESBL+ sensitive to cefepime, but urine culture from here grew two different strains of K. Pneumonia resistant to cefepime.
# C. difficile diarrhea: Patient has fever, WBC > 15.
He has evidence of sepsis and elevated serum lactate (> 2.5), which may be from sepsis from a urinary source.
# Mild metabolic acidosis: Likely secondary to fluid resustication with NS and and diarrheal losses.
Off metorpolol due to bradycardia.
# Normocytic, normochromic anemia: Unclear etiology, stable from prior admission .
# Congestive heart failure: There is no ECHO on file at [**Hospital1 18**] or atrius but per reports, patient has history of ?
EKG done on [**8-23**] showed asymmetric t-wave inversions in V1, meaning possible left heart strain.
Given his cardiac history, findings of edema and lung sounds, and the fluid recussitation, the most likely reason for the strain was the NS bolus during septic shock.
The pt was given IV lasix with resolution of his edema and lung findings.
# Transitional Issues - 10d course of IV Meropenem 500mg q6.

Diff, Atrial fibrillation, Urinary Tract Infection, Type 2 Diabetes, Congestive Heart Failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
The fevers you were experiencing were secondary to bacteria from your urinary tract infection invading your bloodstream.
You also had a C.Diff infection in your gastrointestinal system.
