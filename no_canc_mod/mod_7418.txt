The patient presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] with three days of shortness of breath, pedal edema on [**2131-3-25**], and on electrocardiogram there, the patient was found to be in complete heart block with escape rhythm in the 30s.
The patient was also in congestive heart failure.
He has chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of approximately 2.3.
Given both pacing needs and history of ventricular tachycardia, the patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] for pacer defibrillator placement.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
History of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/emphysema.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Lungs - Expiratory wheezes with poor air flow.
The abdomen was soft and nontender.
Extremities - +1 lower extremity edema bilaterally.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 73 year old male with complete heart block and history of ventricular tachycardia transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] with temporary pacing wires for permanent pacemaker/possible AICD placement.
On the night of admission the patien developed progressive respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema, and was intubated and sedated.
The patient had initially been started on Dopamine and Neo-Synephrine for hypotension status post the intubation.
The patient went to the Electrophysiology Laboratory and had a biventricular permanent pacemaker placed with no complications.
The patient was found to have a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20%, TR gradient of 45, left atrium elongated, right atrium was mildly dilated.
Catheter pacing wire was seen in the right ventricle and/or right atrium, left ventricle wall thickness normal, cavity was mildly dilated, several global left ventricular hypokinesis, no mass or thrombi seen in the left ventricle, right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated, right ventricular systolic function appeared depressed, [**12-7**]+ mitral regurgitation, moderate 2+ tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The patient is a 73 year old male who presents with an ejection fraction of 20%, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with complete heart block, status post permanent pacemaker, also history of ventricular tachycardia, but the patient's family wanted him to be do not [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not resuscitate.
As a result, he did not have an AICD placed.
Rhythm - Complete heart block - He is status post permanent pacemaker placement with no events.
The patient was noted to have brief episodes of atrial fibrillation, however the decision was made not to initiate coumadin at this time due to risk of falling and anemia and the relatively short periods of time that the patient has been in atrial fibrillation.
Coronary artery disease - Aspirin, statin, low dose Zestril for congestive heart failure.
The patient should be followed up and have his Coreg started as an outpatient in the outpatient cardiology setting if his blood pressure tolerates it for his heart failure.
Pulmonary - The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and has received Atrovent nebulizers here and is on Singulair as well and uses a Combivent inhaler.
Congestive heart failure.
Complete heart block, status post permanent pacemaker placement.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy.
