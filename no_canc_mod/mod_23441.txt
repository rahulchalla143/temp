The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality (particularly inferior-posterior) cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 76 year old gentleman with paroxysmal atrial fibrilllation, gout, and prostate cancer admitted from OSH after STEMI treated with lytic therapy.
He was hypertensive but otherwise hemodynamically stable and without chest pain on transfer.
He underwent urgent catherization which revealed 80% lesion in diagonal artery D1 and several other lesions.
As flow was TIMI 3 and as pt was CP free, stents were not placed.
The patient remained chest pain free and hemodynamically stable through the rest of his admission.
He was also bridged with heparin to start coumadin for his atrial fibrillation which had not been treated with anticoagulation prior to admission.
Of note, his course was also complicated by R groin hematoma at cath site.
Distal pulses were preserved and there was no evidence of pseudoaneurysm on imaging.
No clinical evidence of RP bleed.
1) Cardiovascular a) Ischemia: Post-lytic, diagnosistic cardiac catheterization demonstrated R-dominant heart with likley culprit D1 lesion with 80% tubular obstruction, and TIMI-3 flow.
Also noted was 80% terminal OM lesion with TIMI-3 flow, 90% distal AVG-LCx lesion, moderate diffuse RCA disease, with 60% tubular lesion and normal flow at origin of PDA.
Also started spironolactone for remodeling and BP control.
Course complicated by large post-cath R groin hematoma, with no visible pseudoaneurysm on U/S.
Post-MI TTE was poor quality, but demonstrated EF 70%, mild symmetric LVH, 1+ MR. As above, was maintained on metoprolol, captopril, and spironolactone.
c) Rhythm: Remained in atrial fibrillation throughtout stay.
Unclear why pt was not previously on coumadin, though did have distant h/o radiation proctitis in setting of his prostate cancer treatment.
He was rate controlled well with metoprolol, and was placed on heparin bridge to coumadin.
2) Gout: No evidence of acute flare during hospitalization.
3) Prostate CA: Held Casodex in setting of acute MI, as can contribute to volume overload state.
Outpatient Lab Work Please check CBC, chem 7, PT/PTT/INR on [**2156-5-6**]   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis STEMI * Secondary diagnoses history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation hypertension prostate cancer gout history of radiation proctitis   Discharge Condition: good   Discharge Instructions: Please take all of your medications as prescribed.
We were concerned about some of the rare side effects of Casodex, such as heart failure and myocardial infarction.
* Please call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you have chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, if you cannot eat, drink, or take your medications or if you develop any other symptoms that are concerning to you.
You should go to his office on [**2156-5-6**] to have your labs drawn - you will need to have your INR checked so that your coumadin level can be adjusted.
