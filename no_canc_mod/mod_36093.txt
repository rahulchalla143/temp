The patient also endorsed increased shortness of breath, weakness and fatigue.
The patient had been recently admitted 8/21-25/[**2163**] to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for pneumonia and MRSA bacteremia/sepsis and had been discharged on Vancomycin and baby aspirin (for his atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease).
Given his tender abdomen, there was initial concern for an intrabdominal event.
As the imaging was negative, there were no acute surgical concerns; ACS recommended tagged RBC if he continued to bleed.
The patient has had hematuria in the past, with three-way foley in place.
Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient was resting comfortably in bed with trach/PEG, endorsing fatigue and abdominal pain.
When she saw him at 6pm yesterday evening, he was stable without signs of bleeding.

IMAGING: [**2163-9-9**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Blunting of the left costophrenic angle and left base opacities consistent with left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be entirely excluded.
Cardiomegaly and prominent right hilum again seen.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, improved.
Ascites is new since most recent exams dating back to [**2161**], likely correlating with diffuse anasarca.
Slight increase in size of 9-mm enhancing left liver lobe lesion which is incompletely characterized on this exam.
This might be a flash filling hemangioma or focal nodular hyperplasia.
No other acute intra-abdominal process.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE 84yo M PMHx CAD s/p stenting, systolic CHF (EF40-45%), atrial fibrillation, recent hospitalization for MRSA bacteremia of respiratory source, who represented from MACU with hematuria and blood in colostomy bag, thought to be secondary to recent initiation of ASA, now resolved after holding ASA, hemodynamically stable x multiple days, being discharged to MACU.
ACTIVE # Blood in Ostomy: Patient w/ history of UGIB secondary to angiectasias in the duodenum who presented w/ trace blood in his ostomy; patient remaining hemodynamically stable w/ PEG lavage negative; Trace blood in his colostomy bag suggests lower GI bleed; given temporal relationship to initiation of ASA, this was felt to most likely be an exacerbation of underlying issue; bleeding resolved with holding of ASA.
His cardiologist was notified because the patient is now no longer on aspirin or [**Year (4 digits) **], but bleeding risk strongly outweighs stroke risk at this time.
# Hematuria: Patient with a history of hematuria of uncertain etiology who presents w recurrence of bleeding, thought to be secondary recent initiation of ASA; holding of ASA resolved bleeding issue; patient will need to have outpatient follow-up with urology for discussion of cystoscopy; (appt was not yet scheduled).
Sending extra replacements with the patient.
# MRSA bacteremia: Pt w recent admission notable for MRSA bacteremia w/o TTE evidence of valvular involvement; continued vancomycin treatment course (last day is [**2163-9-18**]); level was supratherapeutic during this hospitalization; adjusted dosing to 500mg [**Hospital1 **].
Could consider restarting as outpatient if he became hypertensive.
# Sacral decubitus ulcer: Stage IV, significant.
Appropriate wound care.
Patient became loopy receiving oxycodone 5mg Q4H.
# Atrial fibrillation: CHADS4 but off anticoagulation/antiplatelet secondary to history of GI bleeds, hemothorax in 6/[**2163**].
Sending extra replacements with the patient.
- Continue vancomycin for MRSA bactermia until [**2163-9-18**], next traough needs to be morning of [**9-14**].
