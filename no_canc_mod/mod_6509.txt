REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: evaluate for pneumothorax s/p chest tube removal PORTABLE CHEST OF [**2110-4-11**]  COMPARISON: [**2110-4-9**].
Following removal of left-sided chest tube, a tiny left apical pneumothorax has developed.
Various other lines and tubes have been removed with a right internal jugular vascular sheath remaining in place.
Cardiac and mediastinal contours are slightly widened compared to the recent postoperative radiograph with associated distention of the azygous vein, probably reflecting a mild degree of volume overload.
Bibasilar atelectasis has worsened compared to the pre-extubation radiograph.
Small left pleural effusion is without change.
Very small left apical pneumothorax following left chest tube removal.
Worsening bibasilar atelectasis and probable mild volume overload.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
Results were personally  Conclusions: Prebypass  1.No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2.Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
4.There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**11-19**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Biventricular systolic function is preserved.
Mild mitral regurgitation persists.
