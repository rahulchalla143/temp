Admission Date: [**2116-3-5**]        Discharge Date: [**2116-4-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2116-3-5**]        Sex:  M  Service:  NB   HISTORY:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname **] was born at 34-2/7 weeks gestation to a 35-year-old G3, P1, now 2 woman with past medical history notable for mitral valve prolapse and cardiac palpitations accompanied by panic attacks not on medication.
Her past OB history was notable for a spontaneous abortion in [**2113**].
This was a di-di diamniotic, dichorionic IVF pregnancy complicated by placenta previa and preterm labor.
Mother presented with preterm labor and proceeded to cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.
Rupture of membranes occurred at delivery yielding clear amniotic fluid.
There was no intrapartum fever or clinical evidence of chorioamnionitis.
The infant emerged vigorous at delivery, was suctioned by bulb, dried and tactile stim were given and given brief blow by O2 and subsequently pinked with no respiratory distress in room air.
No nasal flaring.
There was a positive red reflex bilaterally.
Chest showed mild intercostal retractions with intermittent mild grunting respirations.
No adventitious sounds were audible.
Abdomen was soft and nondistended, no organomegaly or masses.
SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  Respiratory: The infant developed mild grunting shortly after entering the NICU and was placed on nasal prong CPAP and remained on CPAP until day of life l when the infant weaned to room air.
Although has had rare and intermittent apnea of bradycardia episodes which have been the main reason why he has remained in the hospital up to this late date from prematurity.
At the present time his most recent apneic bradycardiac episode was on [**2116-4-17**] and that was associated with an oral feeding.
It has been felt due to the prolonged apnea and bradycardiac episodes that the infant may be having reflux which we will discuss when we get further down to gastrointestinal.
For five days prior to discharge there were no bradycardic spells and it is not felt that he has apnea or bradycardia due to immaturity at this point, likely these spells are related to reflux.
Cardiovascular: At birth he had remained hemodynamically stable but presented with a murmur on day of life 10 which was [**2116-3-15**].
The electrocardiogram showed mild right ventricular hypertrophy.
An echocardiogram was performed on [**2116-3-16**] showing small ASD versus a "stretched" PFO and a trivial peripheral pulmonary stenosis.
His calories were further concentrated for growth and nutrition to maximum caloric density of 24 calories per ounce of breast milk or Enfamil.
of 24 calorie breast milk or Enfamil.
He has had intermittent spitting episodes but has been retaining his feeds thus far with rare spits.
Gastrointestinal: Due to the suspected reflex causing the apneic and bradycardiac episodes the baby was started on Reglan and Zantac on [**2116-4-13**].
The infant had the one spell on [**2116-4-17**] which resembled a reflex type episode with grimacing and bradycardia.
The infant developed hyperbilirubinemia in a mild form, did require phototherapy for a peak bilirubin level of 9.6/0.3 and received a total of 2 days of phototherapy.
Infant has remained free of signs of sepsis since that time and no further evaluations have been done.
There are no concerning issues at this time but if there are any further concerns the social worker can be reached at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8717**].
Day care during RSV season, a smoker in the     household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or     school age siblings or with chronic lung disease.
Before this age and for the first 24 month of the childs life, immunization against influenza is recommended for house hold contacts and out of home caregivers.
Sepsis ruled out.
Mild right ventricular hypertrophy.
Apnea and bradycardia of prematurity.
Anemia of prematurity.
