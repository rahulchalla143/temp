There is enhancement of the soft tissues within the surgical bed consistent with granulation tissue.
Posterior to the L5 and S1 vertebral body, there are fluid collections which are stable to slightly larger in size.
There is increased soft tissue enhancement anterior to the S1 vertebral body that is slightly increased when compared to the prior exam.
There is increased compression on the right side of the thecal sac at L5-S1.
CXR MON [**2139-5-25**] :Tip of the new left subclavian line projects over the junction of the brachiocephalic veins, following removal of the right internal jugular line.Right PIC line tip projects over the mid SVC.
No pneumothorax, mediastinal widening or pleural effusion.
No masses or vegetations on aortic valve.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
No mass or vegetation on mitral valve.
No mass or vegetation on tricuspid valve.
Borderline PA systolic hypertension.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of valvular vegetations.
Borderline pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2139-5-1**], no mitral regurgitation is seen.
[**2139-5-26**] KNEE (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) LEFT  IMPRESION: Subchondral cyst along anterior aspect of (right or left) femoral condyle.
No intra-abdominal fluid collection.
Rind of soft tissue anterior to L5-S1 with stranding, compatible with infection as seen on MRI of [**5-24**].
Tiny (9 x 7 mm) focus of fluid at the surgical site posterior to the spinous process of L3, at the interface of subcutaneous tissues and paraspinal muscles.
Numerous findings are unchanged, including enhancing liver lesions and left adrenal nodule, each of which are indeterminate and for which MRI is recommended once the patient's clinical condition permits.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt was admitted to the hospital through the emergency department for worsening back pain and spasm after lumbar wound washout [**Doctor Last Name **] days #21 and #14.
Pt admitted for pain control and then during the initial days was complaining of left knee pain which was tapped for about 30+ cc of fluid by ortho.
The lab results were no microrganisms.
Repeat imaging via CT and MRI of the abdomen and spine were obatined and the results showed bladder distention and stool and stable fluid appearance in surgical area.
The sutures were removed from the wound on [**2139-5-29**] which was clean, dry and well healed without erythema.
