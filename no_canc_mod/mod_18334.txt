Patient had fever 2 days prior to admission, had a rising ESR, and recent lumbar area instrumentation.
The MRI revealed no evidence of epidural abscess, hematoma, or discitis, but marked epidural lipomatosis narrowing the caudal portion of the spinal canal and possibly compressing the thecal sac.
On the afternoon of [**2192-10-24**], the patient became obtunded, initially thought to be [**3-20**] hypoglycemia.
No significant improvement with dextrose infusion.
ABG obtained which revealed respiratory acidosis most likely from hypoventilation.
Transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**2192-10-24**] for noninvasive ventilation.
ICU Course ([**Date range (1) 20343**]): # Acute on Chronic Back Pain: Pain service recommended medical management and no interventional strategies.
Pain was managed with gabapentin, duloxetine, and PO dilaudid.
# Acute on Chronic Respiratory Failure: Bipap was initiated.
Suspicion that ativan given for MRI sedation combined with narcotic analgesia and underlying obesity hypoventilation syndrome and sleep apnea contributed.
# Diabetes type 2, uncontrolled: HbA1C 10.9 despite outpt insulin.
Initially hypoglycemic in setting of obtundation.
# Chronic kidney disease, stage 3, recent baseline Cr 1.3-1.5: Thought [**3-20**] to HTN/DM.
Cr was monitored as ACE-I was increased and IV lasix was given with mild increase in Cr.
# Hypertension: On home lisinopril 5 mg po daily, started amlodipine.
# Fluid Overload: Pt suspected to be fluid overloaded [**3-20**] to OSA and vascular congestion on CXR.
Brief Medical Course ([**2192-10-27**] to [**2192-10-31**]): His pain remained in moderate control.
Infectious disease did not feel back pain was due to an infection.
Diuresing massively with small doses of lasix, he developed worsening renal failure (creatinine 2), so lasix discontinued and the renal function then stabilized.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Morphine 15 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q3H (every 3 hours) as needed for Pain for 2 weeks.
Acute respiratory failure.
Acute renal insufficiency.
Obstructive sleep apnea.
Repiratory failure occured while in the hospital due to overmedication.
Pain was controlled with acetaminophen, narcotic pain medication, and a muscle relaxant, tinazidine.
