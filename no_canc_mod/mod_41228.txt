IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2101-2-20**]:  Small left pleural effusion is stable, and there is no pneumothorax.
Mild-to-moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable but there has been a decrease in vascular plethora consistent with improving cardiac function.
Left ventricular function.
Mitral valve disease.
Pulmonary hypertension.
Right ventricular function.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Moderately depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Mild mitral annular calcification.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:           N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic Conclusions Prebypass  No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesia of the apical and mid portions of the inferior, inferolateral and inferoseptal walls..
with mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**2101-2-14**] at 900am  Post bypass  Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine and epinephrine.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
Mild mitral regurgitation persists.
Electronically signed by [**Name6 (MD) 1509**] [**Name8 (MD) 1510**], MD, Interpreting physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2101-2-16**] 14:19     Brief Hospital Course: Was admitted same day surgery and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and a mitral valve repair.
He took several days to wean from inotropic support.
He was slow to wean from supplemental oxygen due to persistent left effusion requiring more aggressive diuresis.
