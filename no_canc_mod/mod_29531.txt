Removal of 5th metatarsal on right foot  History of Present Illness: 79 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, CHF (EF 35-40 on echo [**7-4**]), DM2, HTN, Hyperchol, AF, CRI (baseline Cr 2.5-2.7), BOOP [**2-2**] amio presenting for diuresis with milrinone.
Recently admitted [**2110-11-10**] for diuresis with aldactone, lisinopril and BNP.02, lasix 7.5, toprol, though per discharge summary, patient did not have effective diuresis.
Course was complicated by afib and was cardioverted, maintaining an AV paced rhythm on procainamide.
He also developed ARF from ATN secondary to hypotension.
Since discharge, he had remained volume overloaded and was admitted to the CCU for tapered milrinone therapy.

[**2190-12-23**] Non-invasive vascular studies.
Pulse volume recordings in the right lower extremity demonstrated a mildly blunted waveform in the thigh with appropriate calf augmentation.
There is some dampening at the level of the ankle and further dampening at the level of the metatarsal approximately 6 mm of deflection at the metatarsal level.
RLE:  The CIA had mild disease.
The EIA had an 80% tubular lesion at the level of the IIA.
The SFA had mild disease.
The distal AT had a focal 60% lesion at the level of the DP.

Also with severe PVD and right foot ulcer.
1) Severe CHF - The patient initially had severe signs and symtpoms of CHF including shortness of breath, wet crackles at b/l bases, and elevated JVD.
This regimen was [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] (net output 200-300cc/day) given the patient's history of renal failure and hypotension with aggressive diuresis.
The natrecor was stopped due to decreased UOP and BP.
At this time, he was breathing well with clear lungs and no exam findings consistent with CHF.
He began to demonstrate signs and symptoms of volume overload including wet crackles and increased oxygen demand.
Further diuresis was initiallyl held given his poor renal function and the renal team closely followed with the prospect of HD.
Pt had good output to this and his acute CHF exacerbation resolved.
2) CAD - The patient has a history of CAD.
He had no chest pain or signs of ischemia during the admission.
The nuclear report was signficant for a severe fixed perfusion defect at the mid and distal lateral wall and severe fixed perfusion defect of the basal/mid inferiour wall.
His ACEi was stopped following the episode of acute on chronic renal failure.
However, it was restarted after his creatinine had trended down with no rebound elevation of the creatinine.
3) Atrial fibrillation - The patient has baseline afib on procainamide and metoprolol with a BiV pacer.
4) Renal Failure - The patient has baseline CRI from his diabetes with a baseline Cr in the high 2's.
Of note, the pt did undergo vain mapping for possible future HD but that is not indicated at this time.
5) Oseteomyelitis/PVD - Patient was admitted with a stable ulcer on his left foot.
[**Month/Year (2) **] evaluated the pt once he was sent out of the unit and felt that this lesion was consistant on x-ray and by history with osteomyelitis.
The risks and benefits of this procedure was thoroughly explained to the patient given the possibel exacerbation of his renal failure.
In the cath lab, the patient was found to have severe right EIA and run-off disease, stenting of the right EIA, and atherectomy of the right AT with much improved flow to the foot.
This was complicated by a small amount of bleeding from the foot on the day following surgery which then stabalized.
Pt has done well since that time and is partial weight bearing.
6) Shoulder Pain - Mr. [**Known lastname 94633**] started to complain of shoulder pain about [**2190-12-15**].
He was found to have an elevated CRP and ESR- although these were possibly due to his osteomyelitis.
His pain was then controlled with vicodin and morphine.
It was most probably due to osteoarthritis.
7) Hypothyroidism - Levothyroxine was continued throughout the admission.
8) Type 2 DM - Continued home insulin ([**1-2**] when NPO) plus RISS which was increased as needed depending on blood sugar levels.

Seek medical attention for fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, weight gain, or other concerning symptoms.
Please maintain your 1.5L fluid restriction so you do not become fluid overloaded.
I attempted to schedule this appointment but have not heard back from his secretary.
This is very important follow-up for your peripheral vascular disease.
