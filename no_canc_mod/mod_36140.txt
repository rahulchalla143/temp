Admission Date:  [**2180-9-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2180-9-29**]  Date of Birth:  [**2107-1-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5368**] Chief Complaint: progressive dyspnea on exertion X 2 days  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: 1. central line 2. arterial line  History of Present Illness: HPI: This is a 72 yo M w/ h/o PVD s/p bilateral bypass, CAD s/p MI / CABG / multiple stents, htn, hyperchol, T2DM, and CRI who p/w progressive SOB.
No fever or sick contacts.
Patient c/o chest pain similar to his MI.
Patient then had respiratory arrest and was intubated.
Due to the patient's CP, shortness of breath, hypoxia and lower extremity edema, a CTA was also done and showed  no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
There was evidence bibasilar dependent atelectasis/consolidations and small pleural effusions.
The findings were also suggestive of early edema.
Past Medical History: MI x 3-4 years ago DM controlled by diet HTN Hyperlipidemia PVD with B fem to distal bypass CABG x 3 in [**2167**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-PDA) .
cath [**2180-6-5**]:  Significant for R dominant system with mid RCA 70% lesion, proximal LCX 90% lesion, mid Cx 70% lesion, 70% mid RCA in stent restenosis, OM1/2 diffuse disease.
No illicit or alcohol drug use.
[**2181-9-24**] Chest portable AP There is continued mild pulmonary edema with cardiomegaly.
Patchy opacity is seen in the left lower lobe indicating atelectasis versus aspiration pneumonia.
[**2180-9-28**] Chest X-ray IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
[**2180-9-28**] U/S extremity nonvascular left IMPRESSION: No DVT.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 73 yo M w/ h/o PVD, CAD, htn, hyperchol, T2DM, and CRI who p/w progressive SOB x 1 week in setting of ischemic changes on EKG.Patient arrived in the ED was in respiratory failure with a SaO2 of 82% and was subsequently intubated and sent to the ICU.
## Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: On presentation the differential for the patient's hypoxic respiratory failure included PE, CHF or pneumonia.
Chest xray and CT on presentation showed no clear infiltrate but possible pulmonary edema.
Minimal trop leak (down from prior in [**6-13**]) and flat CK-MB argued against a MI, which again would result in CHF.
PE was also considered given relative immobility in the few days before presentation and h/o increasing left > right [**Location (un) **] over the past week.
Pneumonia was also considered due to the patient's chronic cough prior to admission and temperature spike to 100 while intubated.
It was also theorized that the patient's respiratory failure was caused by anemia leading to increased demand .
## CAD s/p MI, CABG, and multiple stents: C/o chest pain similar to MI when he initially called his son.
EKG displayed normal sinus tachycardia with w/ ST depressions but in setting of RBBB.
Right bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular block.
Lateral ST-T wave changes are non-specific.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2180-9-24**] no significant change.
## CHF: CXR shows interval development of patchy air-spaces opacities bilaterally consistent with pulmonary edema.
Likely prerenal secondary to decreased ECV and poor CO.
## Lactic acidosis was likely due to respiratory failure.
There was no Fever or elevated wbc to suggest infxn/sepsis.
EGD [**3-14**] with gastritis and healing ulcer w/ nodule in fundus.
c-scope in '[**77**] w/ diverticulosis and hemorrhoids.
Disp:*30 1 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Respiratory Failure (unclear etiology may have been secondary to demand ischemia contributing to congestive heart failure)   Discharge Condition: Good   Discharge Instructions: Please take all medications as prescribed.
Please call your doctor or go to the ER if you have any Chest pain, shortness of breath,fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or any other symptoms that concern you.
