She subsequently complained of photophobia and nausea/vomiting x 3.
She was taken to an outside hospital ([**Hospital3 **]) where noncontrast head CT revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Acute blood was noted in the left ambient cistern, prepontine cistern, and left sylvian fissure.
No evidence of 4th ventricular blood.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for neurosurgical evaluation.

PROCEDURE: Right vertebral arteriogram, right common carotid arteriogram, right internal carotid arteriogram, left vertebral arteriogram, left common carotid arteriogram, left internal carotid arteriogram, and left external carotid arteriogram.
INDICATION: 67-year-old female with subarachnoid hemorrhage predominantly in the left suprasellar, ambient, and quadrigeminal plate cisterns with extension into the left sylvian fissure.
No source of bleeding was identified on CTA of the head performed earlier in the same day.
The discussed risks included stroke, loss of vision and/or speech which may be temporary or permanent, injury to blood vessels, and possible treatment with stents and coils if needed.
Access to the right common femoral artery was obtained using a micropuncture kit with 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate for local anesthesia.
The following vessels were selectively catheterized and arteriograms were performed from the following locations: Right vertebral artery, right common carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, left vertebral artery, left common carotid artery, left external carotid artery, and left internal carotid artery.
RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY: The right vertebral artery and the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery appear normal.
There is reflux into the left vertebral artery and into the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery, which appeared normal.
The basilar artery, its brainstem branches, both anterior- inferior cerebellar arteries, and both superior-cerebellar arteries appear normal.
There is no evidence of an aneurysm or a vascular malformation.
The external carotid artery and its branches are normal.
There is no evidence of a vascular malformation.
RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: Cervical, petrous, cavernous and supraclinoid segments of the internal carotid artery are normal.
There is no evidence of an aneurysm or a vascular malformation.
LEFT VERTEBRAL ARTERY: The left vertebral artery and the left posterior- inferior cerebellar artery appear normal.
There is a reflux into the right vertebral artery and into the right posterior-inferior cerebellar artery, which appear normal.
The basilar artery, its brainstem branches, both anterior- inferior cerebellar arteries, and both superior-cerebellar arteries appear normal.
There is no evidence of an aneurysm or a vascular malformation.
There is no evidence of a vascular malformation.
LEFT EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY: The left external carotid artery and its branches are normal.
There is no evidence of a vascular malformation.
There is no evidence of an aneurysm or a vascular malformation.
No evidence of an aneurysm or a vascular malformation.
Mild tortuosity of the bilateral cervical vertebral and cervical internal carotid arteries.
No significant stenosis is identified.
Please note that the anterior communicating artery is not visualized, likely representing hypoplasia as correlated with the CT angiogram of the head performed earlier in the same day.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CHEST (PRE-OP AP ONLY)  [**2153-3-19**] 3:22 AM  CHEST (PRE-OP AP ONLY)  Reason: preop study  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 67 year old woman with subarachnoid hemorrhage REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: preop study HISTORY: Pre-operative for subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Diffuse fine prominence of interstitial markings could reflect chronic pulmonary disease, increased pulmonary venous pressure, or both.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
CTA HEAD  HISTORY: 67-year-old female with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Assess for source of hemorrhage.
HEAD CT:  There is subarachnoid hemorrhage predominantly within the left-sided basal cisterns including the left side of the suprasellar cistern, the medial left sylvian fissure, the left ambient and quadrigeminal cisterns.
There is inferior extension into the prepontine cistern and the left cerebellopontine angle and superior extension along the tentorium into the left side of the supracerebellar cistern.
There may be a tiny amount of intraventricular blood layering within the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
No suspicious bony abnormalities are seen.
CTA HEAD:  No intracranial aneurysms or vascular malformations are seen.
There is a short-segment stenosis of M2 segment of the left middle cerebral artery.
There are also short segment stenosis of the P2 segment of the left posterior cerebral artery and two short segment stenoses of the P2 and P3 segments of the right posterior cerebral artery.
The visualized dural venous sinuses and cerebral veins appear normal.
There is a mucous retention cyst within the left maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION: Predominantly left-sided subarachnoid hemorrhage as described above.
No intracranial aneurysms or vascular malformations.

The procedure was uneventful and the patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.
FINDINGS: There is mild to moderate vasospasm of the left A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery.
No aneurysms is identified in the anterior posterior circulations.
There is no vascular malformations identified.
There is no high grade stenosis.
IMPRESSION:  Mild to moderate vasospasm of the left A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery.
Otherwise, there is no aneurysm identified.
There is no vascular malformation or occlusion noted.
She was in previously good health except for history of hypertension who noted a sudden onset severe left occipital headache at approximately 0900 on [**2153-3-18**].
She subsequently complained of photophobia and nausea/vomiting x 3.
