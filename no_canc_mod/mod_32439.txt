Admission Date:  [**2122-10-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2122-11-2**]  Date of Birth:  [**2081-12-27**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROSURGERY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2724**] Chief Complaint: weakness  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: History of Present Illness: 40 year-old woman with a history of neck pain, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, fibromyalgia, and possible rheumatoid arthritis,who presents as transfer from OSH for evaluation of ascending numbness and inability to walk.
The patient reports having a history of chronic paraspinal neck discomfort that she attributed to "muscle tension."
Last Tuesday, she was feeling relatively well, when she went for her final adjustment.
On Wednesday evening into Thursday, she developed a sharp pain in the musculature just medial to her left scapula and radiating to the extensor surface of her upper left arm, stopping at the elbow.
On Thursday evening, she went to asleep and awoke at 2 am with numbness from her feet circumferentially to a level just below her umbilicus.
By Friday night however, the pain radiating into her left arm was worsening, and she decided to present to an OSH emergency room.
She was told that she had a "pinched nerve" and was given diclofenac and cyclobenzaprine for pain control.
On Sunday, she returned to the OSH ER with anxiety regarding her numbness, which was ascending toward her breast.
There was evidence of cervical cord compression (see details under data), and the patient was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for possible spinal surgery.
MRI of the cervical spine from [**10-13**] (performed in evaluation of persistent bilateral hand tingling, see below) was compared to MRI of the spine performed [**10-26**].
The cervical spine imaging was evaluated with Radiology, and it was felt that there was no significant interval change in the cervical spine or disease elsewhere that could reasonably explain her presentation.
She underwent surgery for the carpal tunnel on the right in [**Month (only) 205**] (along with a ganglion cyst removal), but did not have significant relief of symptoms.
Her symptoms have persisted over time, but may have improved a bit.
-Rheumatoid arthritis: Has been seen by a rheumatologist for a polyarthritis, primarily involving shoulders, knees, and ankles.
-Right foot/ankle fracture after a fall in [**Month (only) 547**].
Family History: Family History : No history of multiple sclerosis or other neurologic disease   Physical Exam: Physical Exam Vitals: T afebrile    BP 156/73   P 96    RR 18-20    SaO2 96 RA General: NAD, mildly anxious, obese HEENT: NC/AT, sclerae anicteric, MMM, no exudates in oropharynx Neck: in hard C-collar at time of examination Lungs: clear to auscultation CV: regular rate and rhythm, no MMRG Abdomen:  soft, obese, non-tender, non-distended Ext: ankles appear a bit swollen bilaterally- worse on the left, pedal pulses appreciated Skin: no rashes  Neurologic Examination:  Awake and alert, attentive and fully oriented, able to relay history, cooperative with exam, Language: fluent, clear speech, sticcato,no paraphasic errors.
Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 4 to 2.5 mm bilaterally, no APD seen.
Extraocular movements intact, no nystagmus.
Motor: Normal bulk and increased tone in the legs.
No tremor or adventitious movements observed.
Plantarflexion and dorsiflexion are preserved and full at the left ankle, but weakly antigravity on the right due to pain from her prior fracture.
Pertinent Results: Data: MRI spine from OSH: C-spine reveals multi-level degenerative disc disease with large extradural abnormality from C3-C5, as well as C5-6, C7, and T1.
Spinal stenosis was noted at C3-C5 with compression at these levels, most severe at C4-C5.
Thoracic spine reveals disc disease most severe T6-7 on the left, T7-8 across the canal, and T8-9 on the right.
(By my eye, here appears to be thecal indentation with minimal cord impingement by these levels.)
There is degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine, at L3-4, L4-5, and L5-S1.
Minimal narrowing of the canal was noted at L4-L5.
Left ankle films, [**Hospital1 18**]: Soft tissue swelling and possible ligamentous injury noted, no current evidence of fracture.

There were no perioperative complications to report.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain or fever.
Diazepam 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for Spasms and anxiety.
Menthol-Cetylpyridinium 3 mg Lozenge Sig: One (1) Lozenge Mucous membrane PRN (as needed) as needed for sore throat.
Avoid shaving close to the incision line as there may be some areas of numbness which will improve with time.
You should be sure to cut meats and foods into smaller pieces if you have any residual throat soreness or difficulty swallowing.
Any voice hoarseness should also improve steadily.
There is no driving while on narcotic analgesics such as Percocet or Vicodin.
Pain that is continually increasing or not relieved by pain medicine.
Any mew weakness, numbness or tingling in any of your extremities.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, and drainage.
Any change in your bowel or bladder habits (such as loss of bowl or urine control).
