Admission Date:  [**2112-3-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-3-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2052-7-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: SURGERY  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 598**] Chief Complaint: MVC rollover  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**2112-3-7**] Pelvic angiogram and embolization of anterior branch of left internal iliac artery  History of Present Illness: 59F s/p MVC rollover down a 25ft embankment.
Upon arrival of EMS, the patient complained of chest pain and refused to lay supine.
No acute intracranial process.
Moderate-sized right frontal subgaleal hematoma without evidence of underlying fracture.
Apparent mild anterior disc space widening at the C7-T1 level, while there is no surrounding soft tissue abnormality raises conern for a possible ligamentous injury, an MRI is recommended for further evaluation.
Left T1 transverse process fracture and left second posterior rib fractures.
Partial visualization of the posterior right third rib fracture.
Partially visualized right apical pneumothorax and pulmonary contusion.
Large pelvic hematoma with multiple foci of active extravasation.
Large hematoma places mass effect on the bladder.
No definite evidence of bladder injury, however CT cystogram, with the bladder filled with contrast under pressure is more definitive in evaluating for bladder injuries and recommend when clinically appropriate.
Communited, displaced right superior and inferior pubic rami fractures as well as right iliac fracture and widening of the right sacroiliac joint.
Small-to-moderate moderate-sized right hemopneumothorax with numerous rib fractures, as above.
Left scapular fracture.
No perisplenic or subcapsular hematoma is seen.
[**2112-3-8**] CT RLE: Type 3 Schatzker fracture of the right anterolateral tibial plateau with 7 mm of depression accompanied by lipohemarthrosis.
No evidence of bladder injury.
Stable appearance of large pelvic hematoma along with multiple right-sided pelvic fractures.
Increased bilateral pleural effusions, worse on the right, with severe right basilar atalectasis.
3 Mild splenic lacerations, unchanged since [**3-7**].
No subcapsular hematoma or perisplenic fluid seen.
Unchanged right pelvic fracture with stable right iliacus hematoma.
Multiple rib fractures, as seen on the prior CT examination on [**2112-3-7**].
Initial aortogram revealed 2 areas suspicious for active extravasation of contrast from the L internal iliac artery.
The next day on [**2112-3-8**], the patient underwent evaluation by anesthesia/acute pain and had a thoracic epidural placed with good pain control.
This ultimately showed a R comminuted tibial plateau fracture.
She also underwent a CT cystogram, which revealed no evidence of bladder injury and no contrast seen outside the bladder.
She was transfused 2 units of blood and a stat CXR was obtained to evaluate for worsening of her hemopneumothorax.
The CXR showed no significant changes.
IR felt that her bleed was likely venous but that if she became unstable or dropped her hct significantly, they would be prepared to take her for a repeat angio.
As she remained hemodynamically stable she was taken to the Operating Room on [**2112-3-10**] for ORIF of the right tibial plateau fracture and ORIF of her pelvic fracture.
Her pain was adequately controlled and her hematocrit was stable.
She was able to tolerate a regular diet and her pain was adequately controlled with short and long acting oxycodone and scheduled Tylenol.
After stopping Toradol her pelvic pain increased and her Oxycontin was increased to 20 mg [**Hospital1 **].
She was also evaluated by the Occupational Therapy service  as she had + LOC at the accident and needed a good mini mental status evaluation to rule out any post concussive symptoms.
She did have some difficulty with recall and sustaining attention.
She remains afebrile over the last 48 hours and her right hip wound is dry and healing.
Her chest xray still shows some small bilateral effusions without any evidence of consolidation.
Of note, Ms [**Known lastname 23486**] was started on low dose Lopressor on [**2112-3-15**] due to tachycardia which has been present since admission.
Hopefully as the acute phase passes she will normalize and not need beta blockers.
