She had just been transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for advancing dementia, though had been known to have significant sundowning nightly with agitation.
She had been wandering without a walker and sustained a fall.
Admission imaging showed a severely displaced left metadiaphyseal femur fx with severe foreshortening.
CT head and cervical spine showed no acute fracture or displacement.
Her hospital course had been complicated by atrial fibrillation in RVR with rates to the 130s that has responded well to PO metoprolol 100mg q6hr.
Of note, she has a history of apical-form hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and has outflow physiology at elevated rates- she had HF symptoms with this recent RVR that responded to beta blockade.
She has also experienced intermittent agitation on the medicine floor that seems to have responded better to seroquel 25mg than haldol, per medicine attending report.
She underwent operative fixation of her left femoral fracture this afternoon without significant peri or intraoperative complications.
Her pain did not respond to fentanyl, but was controlled with dilaudid PO 6mg.

# POST-EXTUBATION HYPERCARBIA/HYPOXIA:  She began retaining C02 after extubation with an acute respiratory acidosis and hypoxia to the 50s.
Her hypoxia may also have been related to a post-operative atelectasis or even mild congestion each with subsequent V/Q mismatch.
[**3-25**] she was noted to have a new infiltrate on CXR likely to due aspiration and subsequently had increasing 02 requirement, antibiotics started.
# LEFT FEMORAL FRACTURE S/P OPERATIVE FIXATION: Surgery went without incident, but patient required BIPAP post extubation and was transfered to the intensive care unit.
Pain controlled with IV hydromorphone.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WITH RVR:  She has intermittently been in RVR during this hospitalization with rates to the 160 that were difficult to control despite fluid bolus, lopressor, diluadid.
Attempts at pain control, anxiety control and rate control including esmolol gtt were mostly unsuccessful, though she did seem to improve slightly with IV metoprolol Q4H.
Her likely aspiration event showing the pneumonia [**3-25**] was likely due to her altered mental status.
# DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION: Patient became volume overloaded and had increasing oxygen requirements with increasing Cr and was not able to be effectively diuresed.
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: S/P LAD PCI in past.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM: continued levothyroxine.
Likely 2/2 blood loss due to fracture and correction of hemoconcentration.
No grossly bloody stools.
# HEPATITIS C: followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
