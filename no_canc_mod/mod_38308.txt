Patient acutely intoxicated with evidence of trauma on right temple.
Later in course, respirations became later, posterior tongue noted to be obstructing airway, but nasal and oral airways not tolerated.

Within this limitation, no large bleed or mass effect is seen.
There is no ventriculomegaly.
No acute fracture is seen.
The included paranasal sinuses, middle ear cavities and mastoid air cells are clear.
Within this limitation, no large bleed, edema or shift of normally midline structures, and no fracture is seen.
CT C-SPINE [**2162-2-24**]: FINDINGS: No comparison studies available.
Evaluation of finer cortical detail of the cervical spine is limited due to excessive patient-related motion (with no repeat acquisition attempted).
Within this limitation, no acute fracture or traumatic malalignment of the cervical spine is seen; gentle rightward curvature may relate to patient positioning in a hard cervical collar.
There is no prevertebral soft tissue abnormality detected.
Ground-glass opacities are demonstrated within the lung apices, which may simply represent atelectasis.
Suboptimal study due to patient motion; however, no fracture or traumatic malalignment of the cervical spine is seen.
CXR PORTABLE AP [**2162-2-24**]: No comparison studies available.
SEMI-UPRIGHT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: A slightly lordotic view is seen on this frontal projection.
The lungs appear slightly underinflated.
No focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion is seen.
IMPRESSION: Somewhat limited examination due to patient positioning, however no acute intrathoracic process seen.
There are increased bibasilar opacities, which likely represent atelectasis.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely present as well.
Pulmonary vessels are ill-defined, suggesting pulmonary vascular congestion.
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar atelectasis, probable effusions, and pulmonary vascular congestion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 23 M with a history of depression who was brought into the ED acutely intoxicated and admitted to the medical ICU over concern for possible aspiration in the setting of hypoxia.
ACTIVE ISSUES:  # HYPOXEMIA: This developed in the ED in the setting of oversedation from medications administered for combative behavior and alcohol intoxication.
He was noted to be slumped on the stretcher with son[**Name (NI) 7884**] breathing suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea.
He was repositioned in bed to minimize snoring/apnea and oxygen saturations rapidly improved.
There was initial concern for possible aspiration as a cause of the hypoxemia (O2 sats as low as mid-80s noted in ED).
However, given the patient's rapid clinical improvement with repositioning and improvement in mental status it was felt most likely that the hypoxia was secondary to apneic breathing.
When he became more alert, he denied any subjective shortness of breath.
He remained heavily sedated for several hours, though he was rousable and responded to questions with short answers.
# FOREHEAD ABRASION: The patient was noted to have a < 1 cm superficial abrasion on the right temple.
There was no significant hematoma or soft tissue swelling and CT of head and C-spine did not show evidence of bleed or fracture.
He had no clinical evidence of C-spine injury and given the negative findings on CT (albeit in the setting of study limited by motion artifact), cervical collar was removed prior to discharge.
INACTIVE ISSUES:  # DEPRESSION: The patient reported taking citalopram for depression at home; however, his dose was unknown.
He did not feel that this episode of intoxication was related to his mood or worsening depression.
Imaging of your head and neck did not show any evidence of fracture or bleed.
