His post operative course was uneventful except for a small right apical pneumothorax and discharged on post operative day 4.
He had cough with sputum that his primary care physician treated with zithromax.
Then [**8-2**] noted decreased vision in his left eye which was worked up by his primary care physician that included an echocardiogram.
The echo showed mitral regurgitation with a possible leaflet stuck.

Multifocal atelectasis involving the right middle and both lower lobes shows overall interval improvement with residual patchy and linear foci of atelectasis remaining.
Small right pleural effusion is without change.
Prosthetic valve function.
No spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the LA.
Probable thrombus in the LAA.
No mass or thrombus in the RA or RAA.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
Abnormal MVR leaflet/disc motion.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
Conclusions: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
A probable thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No mass or thrombus is seen in the right atrium or right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an echo dense mass on the atrial side of the mitral prosthesis, which is leading to restricted leaflet motion and mitral regurgitation jet of moderate intensity.
There is also possible thrombus formation on the left atrial side of the prosthesis.
POST BYPASS:  [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] biventricular systolic function.
Bioprodthesis in mitral posiiton.
Trace MR and no signofocant gradient.
No other change.
Trace MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 66799**]r systolic function with background inpotropic support.
On postoperative day [**1-15**], continued with aggressive diuresis, transfused with packed red blood cell for hematocrit 21, pain management, chest tube and epicardial wires removed.
Call for any fever, redness or drainage from wounds.
