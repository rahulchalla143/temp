There is minimal pneumopericard, but no evidence of pneumothorax.
Minimal enlargement largely serous left supraclavicular fluid collection since [**2151-7-15**], new small high-density component suggests prior bleeding.
CTA would be required to exclude vascular connections, but the absence of appreciable change argues against active bleeding.
No change in the appearance or location of the left subclavian artery stent and aortic endoprosthesis.
No enlargement of aortic aneurysm.
Probable pulmonary artery hypertension, calcific aortic stenosis, and possible mitral annulus dysfunction from calcification.
Mild bronchiolitis, improved right upper lobe, increased right lower lobe suggests aspiration.
Complete left lower lobe collapse is stable, subtotal lingular atelectasis worsened, right basal segmental atelectasis stable.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, new, left more than right.
Worsening of bibasilar atelectasis, now involving the entire left lower lobe.
Centrilobular nodules seen in the right lung as described, grossly unchanged since [**2151-6-22**], may represent airway infection/inflammation.
No evidence of interstitial lung disease seen.
Several pulmonary nodules that might be of different origin and might be followed in six months if clinically warranted.
Attention to the left lower lobe collapse should be given with subsequent imaging to document its resolution.
Allowing for differences in radiographic technique there is no evidence of change since [**6-22**] in the heavily calcified thoracic aorta with aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending and arch portions, left lower lobe collapse, normal heart size.
Heavy aortic valvular calcifications not appreciated on the conventional radiographs, but clearly seen on the CT scan.
No pleural effusion.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.9cm2).
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is moderate valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2).
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Hyperdynamic left ventricular function.
Moderate mitral stenosis.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Moderate pulmonary hyeprtension.
Sinus tachycardia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2151-7-11**] the findings appear similar, although comparison of atrial rhythm and atrial morphology is difficult because of underlying artifact.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2151-6-22**] no diagnostic interval change.
Brief Hospital Course: [**2151-7-11**] Admitted to Vascular Surgery for hydration and pre-op left carotid to subclavian bypass graft in preparation of endograft repair of thoracic AAA.
Post-op patient was placed on BIPAP for respiratory acidosis.
[**2151-7-14**] Remained in CUICU, required low dose Neo for BP support.
Had periods of agitation requiring medication.
developed respiratory distress and was re-intubated, agitated and confused requiring sedation w/ Propofol.
Her CT chest done- showed a new basal  L pleural effusion.
The CT is placed anteriorly and is not draining the fluid present in the dependant postero basal part of the pleural cavity.
On [**2151-7-22**] CT showed LLL consolidation with mild to moderate element of pleural effusion.
Also noted to have left neck seroma.
Had some problems w/ tachycardia resumed beta blockers.
DVT prohylaxis w/ heparin SC.
Transfused w/ 2 units of packed cells for low HCT.
Patient became febrile on [**2151-7-22**] Urine cx- showed UTI- added Cipro to ABX.
[**2151-8-3**]: No acute events.
Patient had problems w/ agitation w/ intubation, off and on IV sedation for agitation management.
Currently on Oxycodone-acetaminophen elixer for pain and Haldol prn for agitation.
Endo: Patient had been on Glargine at HS and RISS for glycemic control.
Skin: intact, no decubiti or skin breakdown, L neck seroma is stable.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Six (6) Puff Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for wheezes.
Magnesium Hydroxide 400 mg/5 mL Suspension Sig: Thirty (30) ML PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for constipation .
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.
Haloperidol 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for agitation.
