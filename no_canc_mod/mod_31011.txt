No suspicious bony lesions.
Calcification of the anterior tibial artery and the superficial femoral artery are seen.
[**8-26**] Right ankle x-ray: Three views of the right ankle demonstrate medial soft tissue swelling; however, the alignment is normal and there is no fracture or dislocation.
[**8-26**] CXR: Moderate cardiomegaly and vascular congestion.
Left pleural effusion has improved compared to [**2186-4-11**].
No pneumothorax.
[**8-28**] Echo: IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated left ventricle with severe global hypokinesis.
Markedly dilated right ventricle with moderate hypokinesis.
Calcified aortic valve with probable moderate aortic stenosis - the gradient is relatively low due to poor systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation directed towards the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild elevation in right sided and severe elevation in left sided filling pressures.
Severe pulmonary hypertension with a moderately elevated PVR.
Severely reduced cardiac output/index.
Brief Hospital Course: Brief Course: [**Age over 90 **]M with history of sCHF, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 15-20%), severe pulmonary HTN, right sided heart failure, recent worsening of lower extremity edema, presenting now with acute onset right medial ankle pain.
# Acute on Chronic sCHF exacerbation (EF 10-15%) - etiology is non ischemic cardiomyopathy, likely idiopathic, Echo from this admission shows worsening EF of [**9-25**]% with dilated left and right ventricles with global hypokinesis.
Current clinical picture most c/w right sided heart failure, given JVD and lower extremity edema, with minimal evidence of left-sided heart failure at present (lungs CTAB, CXR w/o effusions or pulm edema).
We restarted his home ethacrynic acid given net positive fluid status.
On exam pitting edema appreciated to right and left knee, and lungs with crackles b/l.
In CCU we initiated diuresis which significantly decreased oxygen requirement back to baseline of room air.
Cardioversion considered and TEE done which, unfortunately, showed a left atrial thrombus so cardioversion was not pursued.
#R ankle pain/erythema: Differential diagnosis includes cellulitis, gout, septic arthritis, DVT; much less likely septic arthritis given his ROM now without pain and per rheumatology and ortho will not pursue tap given low likelihood and also overlying cellulitis with fear for introducing infection from skin.
Blood cx were negative, pt was afebrile and WBC remained wnl and stable.
DDx includes pre-renal azotemia in setting of sepsis, ATN secondary to hypotension, poor forward flow in setting of CHF, overdiuresis.

Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname 96686**],  You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for right ankle pain and hypotension.
The right ankle pain was likely due an infection of the skin called cellulitis, which we treated with a full course of antibiotics.
You were also found to be fluid overloaded causing shortness of breath, likely due to your congestive heart failure.
Due to the progressive worsening of your congestive heart failure, you were started on a medication called Milrinone, which is given into your vein using your PICC Line.
Your symptoms improved and swelling decreased.
