Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with patent non-obstructive LMCA.
The RCA was diffusely disease with a 80% proximal lesion that caused catheter damping.
No significant mitral regurgitation was noted.
Limited hemodynamic assessment showed mildly elevated left sided filling pressures and mildly elevated systemic pressure.
[**2126-5-25**] X-ray Following line and tube removal, a small left apical pneumothorax is visualized.
[**2126-5-24**] ECHO Pre-cpb: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
This revealed severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 3075**] was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which revealed no evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis bilaterally with less than 40% stenosis in the proximal left internal carotid artery.
