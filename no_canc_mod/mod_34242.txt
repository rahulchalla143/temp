HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: A previously large left temporal hemorrhage has undergone extensive resorption, with a small amount of residual edema.
There is no new hemorrhage.
There is slight decrease in degree of subdural hemorrhage posteriorly along with falx and tentorium.
Subcutaneous gas and new expected post-surgical pneumocephalus have resolved.
No evidence of new hemorrhage.
Marked interval resorption of right temporal hemorrhage, with minimal residual edema.
Decrease in degree of subdural hematoma posteriorly along falx and tentorium.
Dilated RV cavity.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis (MVR).
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Thickened/fibrotic tricuspid valve supporting structures.
Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA  PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions The left atrium is markedly dilated.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is a paramembranous ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Chest radiographs to check the position of the nasogastric and the endotracheal tubes.
There is massive cardiac enlargement, which could represent underlying cardiomyopathy or a pericardial effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
Cardiac enlargement, which could represent cardiomyopathy or underlying pericardial effusion.

Mass effect on homolateral ventricle and 4 mm leftward shift, mild subfalcine herniation.
Right infratentorial acute subdural blood.
Parenchymal hemorrhage surrounded by vasogenic edema and contains air-fluid levels, differential includes mass and hemorrhagic infarction.
FINDINGS:  HEAD CT:  There is a large intracerebral hematoma identified in the right temporal lobe measuring 7 x 5 cm.
The hematoma contains an intrinsic area of fluid-fluid level.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE HEAD:  CT angiography demonstrates elevation of the right middle cerebral artery secondary to mass effect from the hematoma.
No abnormal vascular structures or aneurysm identified.
There is no vascular occlusion seen.
There is no evidence of dural sinus thrombosis seen.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE NECK:  CT angiography of the neck demonstrates normal appearances of the carotid and vertebral arteries without stenosis or occlusion.
Both carotid arteries measure approximately 5 to 6 mm in the proximal and 4 mm in the distal cervical region.
The patient is seen to have endotracheal intubation.
Large right temporal intraparenchymal hematoma with mild surrounding edema and mass effect on the right lateral ventricle.
No evidence of abnormal vascular structures or aneurysm on the CTA of the head.
Displacement of the right middle cerebral artery is seen secondary to mass effect.
No evidence of occlusion or stenosis in the arteries of the neck.
[**Doctor Last Name 395**]/mtd    SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: Temporal Lobe tissue.
DIAGNOSIS:    Brain, "temporal lobe tissue", resection:  -Cortical [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter with acute and subacute hemorrhage and reactive change.
-No evidence of neoplasm, infection, or amyloid angiopathy is detected.
Clinical: Subdural hematoma right.
Brief Hospital Course: 55F with large temporal lobe hemorrhage with associated edema, and 4mm MLS, mild subfalcine herniation.
A neurology consult was completed to identify reason for bleed,they recommended a CTA head and neck showed No evidence of abnormal vascular structures or aneurysm on the CTA of the head.
Displacement of the right middle cerebral artery is seen secondary to mass effect.
No evidence of occlusion or stenosis in the arteries of the neck.
A opthamology consult was obtained and she was found to have exposure heratopathy with abrasion in both eyes secondary to lagaophlamous.
Medicine was consulted due to her porcine MVR past anticoagulation and developed oliguria on [**5-29**].
Neurologically she continued to progress, she was orientated X3, slight left IP weakness she was full assist with ambulation.
Her wound was clean and dry.
The pt is refusing this consultation stating that she feels her family wants to blame her for the bleeding on the brain.
