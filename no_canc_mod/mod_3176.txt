Admission Date:  [**2118-3-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-3-9**]  Date of Birth:  [**2075-7-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Benzodiazepines  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2927**] Chief Complaint: Seizure cluster (3 at home, 1 in ED in 24 hours)  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 42 year old right handed man with a history of epilepsy since [**5-11**] with known left temporal spikes on EEG and admissions q4-6 weeks for seizure clusters and ?
history of meningitis who presents with 3 GTC in the past 1 day.
The patient reports that overnight he had at least 3 seizures tonight.
His third GTC 3:00 am lasting 3-4 minutes which woke him from sleep which was associated with urinary incontinence.
He complains of a bilateral frontal post-ictal headache.
He has had seizures since [**2115-5-6**], which are characterized by clusters of seizures in the early morning every 4-6 weeks.
[**Name2 (NI) **] Lamictal was added but he self-discontinued that medication because of sleep and GI problems.
Prior to this he was admitted [**Date range (1) 17815**] for increased seizure frequency in the days prior to admission and for delusional thoughts/aggressive behavior.
Psychiatry was consulted and thought his symptoms were most likely a post-ictal syndrome given temporal relation to seizure cluster.
His most recent [**Date range (1) 4338**]/MRA brain ([**10-13**]) showed no abnormality.
Prior EEGs have shown seizure focus in the left mid-temporal region with secondary generalization.
Also interictally, he has left and left>right mid-temporal sharp waves seen suggestive of the potential epileptogenic focus.
He was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17816**] in Neurosurgery in [**1-14**] for possible temporal lobectomy; however, subsequently decided not to have the surgery.
He was treated empirically for bacterial meningitis, but CSF cultures eventually came back with no growth.

These findings are indicative of a mild encephalopathy as well as subcortical dysfunction more prominent on the right.
The latter can be due to the structural abnormality or vascular disease.
There were no epileptiform features noted.
CXR ([**3-6**]): FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is moderate overdistention of the stomach.
No evidence of pneumonia, no pleural effusions, no pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 42 year old right handed man with a history of epilepsy since [**5-11**] with known left temporal spikes on EEG and admissions every 4-6 weeks for seizure clusters, and ?
He denied any infectious symptoms, but did have a bifrontal post-ictal headache.
While in the ED at approximately 6:30 AM, the patient had a fourth [**3-9**] minute GTC with purple face, rhythmic shaking of bilateral upper and lower extremities, witnessed by this author.
Given his decreased responsiveness after this seizure, he was admitted to the Neuro ICU for further evaluation.
Urine/serum tox were negative, UA was unremarkable, and CXR showed no pneumonia.
EEG showed a slower than normal background, generalized right hemisphere slowing, and bifrontal slowing right greater than left consistent with a mild encephalopathy as well as subcortical dysfunction more prominent on the right.
There were no epileptiform features noted.
Medication Ativan 0.5-1 mg SL prn seizure   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Epilepsy  SECONDARY: Bipolar Disorder   Discharge Condition: Full strength, no dysmetria, no tremor   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with 4 generalized tonic clonic seizures in 24 hours in the setting of not receiving sublingual Ativan after the seizures.
If you have another generalized seizure at home, please ensure that you are given sublingual Ativan.
If you develop increased seizure frequency, weakness/numbness, difficulty speaking or swallowing or any other symptoms that concern you, call your PCP or return to the ED.
