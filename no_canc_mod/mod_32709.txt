Admission Date:  [**2156-9-22**]              Discharge Date:   [**2156-10-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-5-22**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Valium  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**] Chief Complaint: Hypotension, chest pain   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 54-year-old female with bipolar disorder, COPD, morbid obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for therapeutic catheterization for possible STEMI.
She was en-route from [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital for psych evaluation for agitation to [**Doctor First Name **] group home when she became lethargic and SBP in 90s in the ambulance.
She noted right arm pain, back pain, and mild chest pain.
EKG demonstrated ST-segment elevations on arrival.
Patient has had recent episodes of chest pain with r/o for MI.
Most recent hospitalization in [**2156-8-17**] for chest/R arm pain following Dobutamine stress echo was thought to be related to pneumonia and/or neuropathy.
During the procedure, the patient experienced low blood pressures with the BP cuff in the SBP 60s.
Per patient, this chest pain is the same as the chest pain she has always had.
She does not appear to have bowel or bladder complaints.
No recent change in appetite, weight loss or gain.
She does have occasional arthralgias, but no myalgias on Zocor.
She denies any headache or rash.
Family History: Notable for CAD, diabetes in father and grandfather.
HEENT: EOMI, no scleral icterus, MMM Neck: supple, JVD or carotid bruits could not be appreciated due to neck obesity Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally, no wheezes, rhonchi or rales Cardiac: distant heart sounds, RR, normal S1 S2, no M/R/G Abdomen: obese, distended but soft, bowel sounds present Extremities: 2+ edema, 2+ radial, 1+ DP pulses b/l Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.. Alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha streptococcus or Lactobacillus sp   Studies: [**2156-9-22**] EKG - Sinus rhythm.
Intraventricular conduction delay.
Delayed precordial R wave transition.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Mild prominence of pulmonary vasculature consistent with mild interstitial edema.
Faint right upper lobe opacification may represent asymmetric edema versus pneumonia.
Enlarged mediastinal silhouette corresponding with fat-enveloped mediastinum on chest CT.
Mild cardiomegaly.
Bilateral hilar contours unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Right upper lobe opacity, asymmetrical edema versus pneumonia.
Stable widened mediastinal contour corresponding with known fat deposition within the mediastinum on recent chest CT. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.
Hilar silhouettes unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Stable right upper lobe opacity representing asymmetric edema versus pneumonia; recommend clinical and radiographic surveillance with repeat of conventional radiographs in 24 hours if still clinically warranted.
There is persistent cardiomegaly and slightly low lung volumes.
No focal consolidation is seen.
There is no overt pulmonary edema or large pleural effusions.
Bony structures demonstrate some minimal wedging of some mid thoracic vertebral bodies.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly without acute cardiopulmonary process.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75-80%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 54 year old female with bipolar disorder, COPD, morbid obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes who presented with hypotension and chest pain.
Chest Pain: ST-elevations were noted on EKG with complaints of chest pain and patient was sent to catheterization.
Prelim report was clean coronaries and no evidence of acute stenosis.
ST-elevations were likely due to early repolarization.
She remained free of chest pain for te remainder of her stay.
Hypotension: Patient had recorded SBPs in 90s with EMS, and became hypotensive in cath lab to SBP 70s.
It was only elevated when she became acutely agitated.
ID: Per the family on admission, she has had several admissions (2X per year) for pneumonia with intubation.
Chest X-ray from admission was concerning for possible pneumonia but may have also been related to aggressive fluid boluses.
Clinically she did not have any symptoms consistent with either pneumonia or CHF.
Urine culture grew >100,000 gram positive bacteria that likely represents normal flora, however it was decided to treat the patient with a three day course of Bactrim given the high colony count.
Her WBC count remained stably elevated around 11-12K.
Altered Mental Status: The patient has a history of Bipolar disorder that has been poorly controlled over the last few weeks.
Clonazepam was initially held due to her hypotension and questionable history of allergy to Diazepam but restarted the evening she was transferred to the floor.
Hyponatremia: Patient's serum sodium was 129 on arrival, possibly related to increased free water intake and increased lithium dose.
Lower Extremity Edema: She was on Lsaix 20 mg PO daily for lower extremity edema on admission.
Her Lasix was held initially due to her volume depletion and hypotension on admission.
Neuropathy: The patient complained of right arm pain, thought to be related to neuropathy per cardiology note from [**2156-9-13**].
Her Neurontin was held early in her admission and she did not complain of right arm pain during her stay.
It was discontinued due to the risk of serotonin syndrome with her other psychiatric medications.

Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization after an episode of chest pain.
Several of your blood pressure medications were stopped or changed because of your low blood pressure.
STOPPED: Isosorbide mononitrate (Imdur) 30 mg daily DECREASED: Furosemide (Lasix) 20 mg every other day (was daily) DECREASED: Lisinopril 5 mg daily (was 10 mg daily) DECREASED: Metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg twice daily (was 100 mg twice daily)  You had a chest X-ray which showed a collection in your lung, but did not have a fever or other signs of infection.
A repeat chest X-ray was performed which did not show any evidence of pneumonia.
The initial finding was most likely from excess fluid after your catheterization and nothing to be concerned about.
You had urine tests during your stay that showed a urinary tract infection.
You were also seen by Psychiatry for your anxiety and bipolar disorder.
