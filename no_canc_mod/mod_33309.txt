Chronic pleural effusions, s/p 2 large volume thoracenteses   Social History: Married, lives on Cape, retired -Tobacco history: 18 years x 1ppd, quit at 34 years old -ETOH: none, social in past -Illicit drugs: none   Family History: Father with MI at 54 y/o, died from colon cancer, mother healthy    Physical Exam: VS: T; 96.6  HR 61-68 SR  BP: 94-137/48-60  Sats: 94% RA  WT: 144.4 (65.5 kg) General: 69 year-old male in no apparent distress HEENT: normocephalic, mucus membranes moist Neck: supple no lymphadenopathy Card; RRR normal S1,S2 I-II/VI SEM Resp: decreased breath sounds on right, bibasilar crackles no wheezes GI: bowel sound positive, abdomen soft non-tender/non-distended Extr: warm 2+ pitting edema bilateral Incision: Right thoracotomy site clean dry intact, margins well approximated, no erythema.
There is a persistent pneumothorax.
There is a persistent moderate pneumothorax, much of which is loculated in the right lower hemithorax.
IMPRESSION: Persistent moderate right-sided pneumothorax [**2178-12-22**]: FINDINGS: Since [**2178-12-21**] at 3:14pm, there is no significant change.
A persistent right moderate pneumothorax is seen with multiple chest tubes in place.
A small left pleural effusion is stable.
[**2178-12-18**]: Slight interval decrease in size of right mild-to-moderate pneumothorax since [**2178-12-17**]: In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is increasing pneumothorax surrounding the left lung.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 51023**] was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2178-12-14**] where he underwent a right thoracotomy with decortication for fibrothorax.
The procedure was complicated by multiple pleural tears with difficulty oxygenating with significant tidal volume loss and postoperative hypotension requiring transfer to the SICU intubated on pressors.
On [**2178-12-15**] failed extubation requiring re-intubation for respiratory failure.
He developed rapid atrial fibrillation hemodynamically unstable requiring amiodarone for rate control after Lopressor and diltiazem were unresponsive.
His respiratory status was monitored closely with serial ABGs with pCO2 in the 70's baseline 50-55% hypercarbia requiring BiPAP.
CPAP at night 98%  Chest-tubes: anterior, posterior apical and basilar chest tubes with persistent air leak was to suction immediately postoperative them placed to water-seal.
The anterior and basilar remained with a persistent air leak.
They were converted to pneumostats on [**2178-12-24**] and will remain until seen by thoracic surgery and the air leak has resolved.
Chest films: he was followed by serial chest films which showed persistent moderate pneumothorax, much of which is loculated in the right lower hemithorax.
Bilateral Pleural effusions with associated areas of atelectasis.
Cardiac: On [**2178-12-18**] he was converted to PO amiodarone 400 mg tid titrated to [**Hospital1 **], home dose digoxin restarted he remained in sinus rhythm 60's with no ectopy.
Keep K+ > 4.0 Mg > 2.0  Pain: Acute pain was consulted on [**2178-12-15**] for epidural placement for better pain management.
He converted to PO pain medication, Lidoderm patch with good pain control.
INR GOAL 2.0 for Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Disposition: he as seen by physical therapy who recommended short term rehab.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Pleasant Bay Nursing & Rehabilitation Center - [**Location (un) 23638**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Right pulmonary effusion CAD, s/p MI at 54 y/o, s/p 2v CABG ([**2178-4-28**]), balloon angioplasty [**2161**] Aortic stenosis s/p bioprosthetic [**Year (4 digits) 1291**] replacement ?ASD vs PFO Atrial fibrillation s/p pulmonary vein isolation OSA on CPAP Testicular cancer s/p XRT to pelvis and periarotic regoins Subdural hematomas x2 Dyslipidemia 9.
Discharge Instructions: Call Dr.[**Name (NI) 2347**] office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2348**] if you experience: -Fevers > 101 or chills -Increased shortness of breath or cough -Incision develops drainage or increased redness -Pneumostats x 2.
-Shower daily, wash incision with mild soap & water, rinse pat dry -No driving while taking narcotics  Heart failure management: Daily weights: keep a log.
