Admission Date:  [**2140-11-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2140-11-19**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78 year old woman with a history of coronary artery disease status post an anterior myocardial infarction on [**2140-10-30**], who received a balloon angioplasty to the distal left anterior descending, who was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] for recatheterization for an elevated troponin level.
The patient was asymptomatic at that time.
She was accepted to [**Hospital1 69**] for re-catheterization and transferred on Nitroglycerin, aspirin, Lopressor, Protonix and Lipitor.
Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction on [**10-30**].
History of iron deficiency anemia.
Peptic ulcer disease status post esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy on 01/[**2140**].
History of breast carcinoma status post left breast lumpectomy and XRT.
Rheumatoid arthritis.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died of renal cancer and esophageal cancer at age 75.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 98/47 to 118/52; heart rate 81 to 94; the patient was afebrile and saturation of 97% on room air.
Cardiac examination is a regular rhythm with no murmurs.
Extremities with no edema, warm, bounding dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
No hematoma at the femoral site.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   In Catheterization the patient was found to have a 90% new proximal left anterior descending stenosis not seen on the catheterization two weeks earlier.
In addition, a small pleural effusion consistent with blood was seen, that was felt to be smaller than the pleural effusion seen on the catheterization report two weeks earlier.
Also of note, in the distal left anterior descending, a small area of localized perforation consistent with a walled off perforation from prior catheterization or a small aneurysm were observed.
LMCA mild disease.
Left anterior descending 90% proximal, diffuse disease distal, localized perforation in distal left anterior descending.
Left anterior descending stenting proximally with minimal anti-coagulation (2.5 hepacoat taken to 3.0), since proximal left anterior descending lesion new and unstable plaque.
A small to moderate sized pericardial effusion septating mainly the sub-diaphragmatic surface of the right ventricular free wall was seen.
The effusion was echo-dense consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
No evidence of tamponade.
The pericardial effusion was felt to be smaller compared to the previous study of [**2140-11-1**].
She received anti-platelet therapy of aspirin and Plavix but no heparin, Coumadin or Integrilin treatment in light of her GI bleed.
When the patient arrived to the unit, she demonstrated two episodes of atrial fibrillation with left bundle branch block.
The patient required no transfusions.
The patient had guaiac positive stool, but no frank bleed was evident.
ACE inhibitor was not started because it was felt that the patient could not tolerate it due to low blood pressure.
