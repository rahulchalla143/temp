Coil embolization of superior rectal artery off of the inferior mesenteric artery with successful hemostasis of active extravasation.
Coil embolization of right middle rectal artery with successful hemostasis of active extravasation of this vessel.
Gelfoam pledget embolization at the mid to distal left internal iliac artery resulting in successful hemostasis of left middle rectal artery active extravasation.
Coils were not deployed given patient's hemodynamic instability.
He had received 7 units at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital and a tag scan there showed no evidence of localization.
A tagged red cell scan showed evidence of a bleed in his distal sigmoid or proximal rectum.
The patient started to develop back pain and a balloon was blown up in the aorta for 15 minutes occluding the site of the perforation.
The balloon was taken down and there was no evidence of extravasation from the aortic perforation.
The bleeding site was seen from collaterals from the internal iliac and Gelfoam was placed.
The Gelfoam stopped the bleeding and once again he was hemodynamically stable and did not bleed for several hours.
Unfortunately he then opened up again and was taken to the operating room for a sigmoid colectomy and proximal rectal resection.
No seizure activity or signs of detoxification were noted under sedation with propofol/fentanyl and benzodiazepine coverage.
Upon discharge he is tolerating a regular diet and his pain is well controlled.
Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every six (6) hours as needed for pain for 2 weeks.
