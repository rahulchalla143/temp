She went shopping on the morning of admission with the return of chest pain while driving in her car.
She describes the chest pain as intense, constant, substernal pain radiating to her back and bilateral shoulders while driving.
She presented to [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 47**] and was found to have 8-mm to 9-mm ST elevations in V2 through V5.
She was given aspirin, heparin, nitroglycerin drip, Integrilin drip, and morphine but she continued to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] chest pain with 3-mm to 4-mm residual ST elevations on heart rate electrocardiogram.
There was a subtotal left anterior descending artery occlusion followed by two serial 60% stenoses with TIMI-I flow down the vessel.
There was a focal left circumflex narrow ostial 90% stenosis, and first large obtuse marginal rising from the midportion of the left circumflex.
The ramus intermedius had a subtotal proximal occlusion with TIMI-I flow.
Hepakote stents were placed after angioplasty in the left anterior descending artery lesion with near TIMI-III flow status post stenting.
There was a post stenting vasospasm which resolved with nitroglycerin and diltiazem.
Post stent electrocardiogram showed 2-mm to 3-mm ST elevations in V2 through V5.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On review of systems, the patient was nauseous and diaphoretic with her previous chest pain, but was chest pain free on arrival to the Coronary Care Unit.
She reports diarrhea times four days (bloody at times); consistent with her ulcerative colitis.
