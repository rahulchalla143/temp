Radiology Report VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW Study Date of [**2191-7-8**] 11:13 AM INDICATION:  84-year-old man status post dog attack with skin graft to bilateral upper extremities, rule out aspiration.
There was significant oropharyngeal residue.
Brief Hospital Course: As noted in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted in the trauma bay to have bilateral mangled extremities.
He also had an absent radial pulse on the left side prompting vascular surgery involvement.
Geriatric team felt fluctuations in mental status were multifactorial and related to trauma, de-conditioning, ICU stay, sleep deprivation, pain medications.
When he was awake and extubated, his pain was controlled with IV dilaudid for dressing changes and oxycodone for complaints of pain in between.
He did have a history of paroxysmal afib but was in normal sinus rhythym for most of his admission.
Heme: Patient required multiple blood product transfusions during his ICU stay due to loss of blood at the scene of the attack and subsequently due to oozing open wounds.
Geriatrics recommended starting patient on thiamine, folate and MVI for h/o heavy EtOH and persistent anemia post-traumatic event and subsequent surgeries.
He was ordered for albuterol nebulizer treatments PRN for wheezes.
A video swallow revealed evidence of some aspiration of thin liquids so patient was placed on soft/ground diet which he tolerated well.
Patient with cumulative nutritional deficit due to events related to trauma and reconstruction.
He was given lasix/albumin to assist with his edema on HD 5.
Patient's foley was maintained for inpatient stay due to inability to utilize a urinal manually d/t bilateral upper extremity injuries and dressings.
Infectious Disease was consulted on [**2191-6-25**] to help with antibiotic guidance and postexposure rabies vaccinations.
The clindamycin was dc'd on [**2191-6-28**] due to lessened concern for a necrotizing soft tissue infection.
A tissue sample obtained in the OR from left elbow grew VRE so Vancomycin was discontinued and patient was maintained on zosyn IV until [**2191-7-11**].
Prophylaxis: Patient was maintained on Lovenox 40 mg QD for DVT prophylaxis and wore pneumo boots while in bed.
At the time of discharge on hospital day #19, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a soft mechanical diet and supervised thin liquids, getting out of bed to chair with mechanical lift, foley catheter draining clear yellow urine, and pain was well controlled.
Bilateral upper extremities (BUE) with skin grafts and integra in place to wound without evidence of infection or breakdown.
Bilateral thigh skin graft donor sites with original xeroform dressings in place and left open to air to dry.

Multivitamins 1 TAB PO DAILY   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Hospital for Continuing Medical Care - [**Location (un) 1121**] ([**Hospital3 1122**] Center)  Discharge Diagnosis: Bilateral upper extremity and left buttock severe bite wounds status post dog attack.
Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
-Bilateral arm dressings should be changed once/day:  Apply xeroform dressing to all skin grafts and wounds on arms and cover with layer of fluffed gauze followed by kerlix wrap and cover with ace wrap.
