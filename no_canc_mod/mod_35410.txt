Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubated and sedated from [**6-28**] to [**7-6**]   History of Present Illness: 82 yo F with history of CHF, recent MVR 6 weeks ago, recently had increased confusion and fatigue of 1 to 2 weeks.
This morning patient awoke with fatigue and dyspnea, and was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] by her son.
Initially reported to [**Location (un) 620**] ED and had an ECHO there which showed EF of 55%, new RV dilation but otherwise intact new valve.
Given her recent cardiac surgery, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
The patient was also noted to have new acute renal failure at that time with K of 7.5 and received 10 of insulin and 60 kayexelate prior to transfer here.
CXR without obvious focal process.
They felt that after he contact[**Name (NI) **] his brother by phone, [**Name (NI) **] called me back to state that he and his brother do not want the pt to undergo more aggressive measures at this time incl a lines, CVL, pressors, CPR, or electric shocks.
For tonight, they would like to continue ABX, mechanical ventilation and medical tx of her [**Last Name (un) **], hyperkalemia and other issues.
Past Medical History: Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure Chronic Atrial Fibrillation- s/p unsuccessful DCCV 10-15yo Hypertension Dyslipidemia Mild to moderate Chronic Renal Insufficiency Possible Amiodarone Pulmonary toxicity.
Hypothyroidism (possibly secondary to amiodarone) History of Digitalis toxicity (likely due to inadvertent overdose) Possible Asthma Extensive surgery on multiple basal cell carcinomas right arm bilateral cataract right total hip replacement thyroid surgery  Social History: Lives with: son Occupation: retired insurance underwriter Tobacco: 1ppd x 25 yrs, quit 30-35 yrs ago ETOH: none   Family History: Non contributory.
NECK: Distended neck veins, prominent pulsations.
PULM: Breath sounds obscured by ventilator noises, but mild crackles heard at right lateral base.
NECK: Supple PULM: Coarse breath sounds bilaterally CARD: Irregularly irregular, no m/r/g ABD: Soft, NT/ND, bowel sounds present.
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Diffuse ST-T wave changes.
Poor R wave progression.
Cannot rule out prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2136-5-18**] atrial fibrillation is new.
[**6-27**] CXR: FINDINGS: The study is compromised secondary to respiratory motion resulting in blurring of the lung bases.
The vasculature is difficult to assess but does not appear significantly distended or indistinct.
No definite focal consolidation is noted.
There is a markedly tortuous aorta with calcified plaque at the arch.
The cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged but stable.
No large effusion is noted.
No pneumothorax is seen in this upright radiograph.
Deformity of the included left humeral head is again noted, though limited.
No overt edema identified.
[**7-2**] ECHO: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.The mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with global free wall hypokinesis.
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild global hypokinesis.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No evidence of hydronephrosis.
Left renal cyst.
Trace free fluid within Morison's pouch.
[**7-7**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Poor R wave progression.
Diffuse ST-T wave changes that are non-specific.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2136-6-27**] there is no significant diagnostic change.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 81 year old woman with history of CHF, MVR with PFO repair 6 weeks ago who presents from home after 1-2 weeks of increasing confusion and more recently shortness of breath, who presented with respiratory failure and sepsis requiring intubation secondary to volume overload from IV fluid resuscitation and Pseudomonas pneumonia.
Pseudomonal pneumonia - She was initially intubated in the ED for hypercarbic respiratory failure and was later found to have pseudomonal pneumonia.
She was extubated successfully on [**2136-7-6**] after optimization of volume status with diuresis.
She should be continued on ipratropium nebs as needed for shortness of breath.
Septic Shock - Likely secondary to pulmonary source as noted above.
Due to persistent hypotension, she required neosynephrine for 24 hours from [**6-30**] to [**7-1**].
Acute on chronic kidney injury: Her creatinine was elevated at 2.8 on admission and peaked at 3.7.
Urine sediment demonstrated oxalate crystals with evidence of tubular injury, consistent with ATN.
A renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis.
She became volume overloaded during her ICU course as a result of aggressive volume resuscitation in the setting of sepsis.
She was diuresed with Lasix aggressively and currently appears to be euvolemic to mildly hypervolemic on exam.
Atrial fibrillation: The patient was found to have atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate on admission.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Olanzapine 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for anxiety, agitation.
CefePIME 1 g IV Q24H day 1=[**2136-6-27**]   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: -Pseudomonas pneumonia -Sepsis -Acute kidney injury -Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate -Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation of increasing confusion and shortness of breath.
You were found to have a serious pneumonia that required a stay in the intensive care unit.
You also developed some kidney injury which resolved and a fast heart rate which was controlled with medications.
You also required extra Lasix dosing to help get some extra fluid off of your body.
The following changes have been made to your home medication regimen: -You should stop taking carvedilol, oxybutynin, lorazepam, Cozaar, and digoxin -You should start taking metoprolol to control your heart rate -You should son[**Name (NI) **] taking cefepime until [**7-13**] to complete a 15 day course for pneumonia -You should continue on a bowel regimen of docusate and senna as needed -You should continue ipratropium nebs as needed for shortness of breath -You should continue Zyprexa as needed  Followup Instructions: You should follow-up with the physicians at the [**Hospital3 **] facility.
