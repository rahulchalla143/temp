His hospital course began on [**2111-1-8**] when he underwent a right carotid endarterectomy for 95% stenosis of the carotid artery.
His postoperative course was complicated by nonspecific T wave changes consistent with myocardial infarction postoperatively as well as hematoma formation.
During his subsequent hospital course, he had an additional CHF exacerbation.
However, just prior to admission to [**Hospital6 256**] he had another acute decompensation with CHF exacerbation.
Cerebrovascular disease, status post left carotid endarterectomy in [**2105**].
Fall from standing on [**2110-12-24**] with resultant displaced radial fracture which was reduced, closed, and casted.
Coronary artery disease.
No history of catheterization prior to admission to the [**Hospital6 2018**].
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.0 to 2.7.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  This is a gentleman who is intubated, comfortable, with minimal sedation.
He was afebrile with a temperature of 99.1.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.
He was medically managed for CHF and underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2111-1-29**].
His catheterization revealed 70% stenosis of the distal left main coronary artery, 90% stenosis of the LAD, 80% stenosis of the circumflex, 90% stenosis of OM2 and a proximally occluded right coronary artery.
Over the ensuing days, Mr. [**Known lastname **] CHF was managed by the CCU Team and he received treatment for what was now determined to be a Klebsiella pneumonia.
The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication and was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit without complication.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a long postoperative course.
His postoperative course was complicated by hypertension which was managed medically.
At the time of discharge, he was on a stable antihypertensive regimen appropriate for someone with a decreased ejection fraction.
After a very slow wean from ventilatory support, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was successfully extubated on postoperative day number nine.
He continued to be very tenuous from a pulmonary point of view and required frequent chest PT.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] had an emergent cricothyroidotomy followed by a formal tracheostomy at the outside hospital.
Such a situation frequently makes it very difficult to swallow without aspirating.
The study was repeated and yet again Mr. [**Known lastname **] was unable to swallow without evidence of aspiration.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 18095**] a distal radius fracture prior to arriving to the hospital.
Postoperatively, there was much edema associated in the postoperative course from coronary artery bypass grafting.
His cast was removed by the Orthopedic Service in anticipation of this edema and to avoid compartment syndrome.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] should follow-up with his orthopedic surgeon in the [**Hospital1 **] for reassessment of his injury and possible removal of the splint.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft, four vessels.
Congestive heart failure.
Failed swallow study status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement.
Central line culture positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus, status post a 14 day treatment with vancomycin and removal of the line.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is afebrile with a temperature of 97.1, pulse 77, sinus rhythm.
There was no evidence of necrosis, erythema or exudate at the site.
There was trace edema in both lower extremities.
There was no increased warmth over this area nor is there any exudate from his wounds.
All of his wounds including sternotomy wound were clean, dry, and intact.
