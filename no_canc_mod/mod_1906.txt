General Instructions Despite the fact that no skin incisions were used, the area around the ureter and bladder is irritated.
You may see some blood in your urine while the stent is in place and a few days afterward.
Because of the raw surface of your bladder, alcohol, spicy foods, acidy foods and drinks with caffeine may cause irritation or frequency and should be used in moderation.
We would suggest to cut down your activity under these circumstances until the bleeding has stopped.
Use a mild laxative if needed, such as Milk of Magnesia [**3-13**] Tablespoons, or 2 Dulcolax tablets.
If you had been taking narcotics for pain, before, during or after your surgery, you may be constipated.
These should be taken as prescribed until the bottles are finished unless you are having an unusual reaction to one of the drugs.
c. Inability to urinate.
e. Severe burning or pain with urination that is not improving.
