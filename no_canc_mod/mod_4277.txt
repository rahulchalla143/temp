She had had a history of small bowel obstructions and had felt these symptoms in previous episodes.
Of note, the patient had a history of a gastric bypass performed several years ago as well as an incarcerated hernia repair.
The patient was admitted to an outside hospital and ultimately underwent an exploratory laparotomy and repair of hernia and was being taken care of at the outside hospital.
However, during her hospital course there, she was found to have serous drainage from her wound and was found to have developed a significant enterocutaneous fistula.
History of varicose veins.
History of small bowel obstructions in the past.
Gastric bypass approximately fifteen years ago.
Breast reduction surgery.
Several ventral hernia repairs.
She also had a PICC line which was placed at the outside hospital and was having wet to dry dressing changes to her abdominal wound.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to [**Hospital1 190**], the patient was afebrile and her vital signs were stable.
She was an obese female in no apparent distress.
Her lungs had some mild crackles but were clear.
Her abdomen was obese, nontender, and she had an open enterocutaneous fistula times three and open surgical wound on her belly with retention sutures in place and Foley catheter was also in place.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Blue Surgery service and was continued on TPN for preoperative nutritional enhancement and it was planned the patient would ultimately undergo exploratory laparotomy and repair of the enterocutaneous fistula.
On [**2170-8-31**], the patient was taken t the operating room for an attempted revision of her multiple enterocutaneous fistulas.
The patient did well from the operation, however, postoperatively she developed single enterocutaneous fistula which caused wound breakdown and again she was started on tube feeding as well as TPN for nutritional enhancement.
Therefore, it was decided that the patient would have to return to the operating room on [**2170-9-13**], for a reexploration and component separation and flap closure, split thickness skin graft closure for this enterocutaneous fistula.
The patient was slowly weaned from the ventilator postoperatively, however, after extubation, she had significant respiratory distress and required significant fluid management.
Again, she required prolonged pressor support for her blood pressure and fluid management.
The patient also had episodes of temperature spikes and was found to have gram positive cocci in blood cultures as well as on line cultures.
She was extubated on [**2170-9-19**], and was able to tolerate for a day, however, she had an episode of bradycardia and asystole on [**2170-9-20**], requiring emergent intubation.
It was noted that the patient had increased distention of her abdomen after this event of respiratory failure with difficulty to intubate and she was noted to have some increased erythema around the graft site.
Her gastrostomy tube was placed to gravity due to the distention and nasogastric tube which had been placed was removed.
The patient was successfully extubated again after response of her respiratory failure.
A vac was placed over her wound site for her erythema and she was diuresed for her pulmonary status as well as for her fluid overload.
Her donor site was doing well and continued on blow drying of the wound site and dressing changes.
Just prior to discharge to rehabilitation, her vac dressing was removed and two small areas of questionable success and viability of the graft were noted.
It was decided that Xeroform gauze dressing changes would be used over the skin graft site for continued wound care.
Orthopedics was consulted early due to knee pain and was found to have osteoarthritic changes of her knee.
Her white blood cell count rose after being off antibiotics and it was felt the patient had a line infection and therefore, she was started on Zosyn.
Neurosurgery was also consulted for low back pain which was a chronic issue which she had had for multiple years.
Ultimately, it was felt that this pain was chronic degenerative changes and there was no plan for change in management.
The patient also had some mild diarrhea which was controlled with Imodium.
This graft as mentioned before had two areas that ultimately looked questionable for viability and therefore, Xeroform dressing changes were done.
She is also to be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the plastic surgery service for her skin graft and also for her abdominal closure.
Enterocutaneous fistula, status post repair times two including a component separation and split thickness skin grafting by plastic surgery service.
Small bowel obstruction, status post exploratory laparotomy and lysis of adhesions times two.
Multiple ventral hernia repairs.
Enterocutaneous fistula formation previously from that.
History of varicose veins.
Status post respiratory failure requiring emergent reintubation.
Multiple line infections and bacteremia requiring multiple antibiotic treatments with prolonged treatment times.
