She was admitted in [**3-3**] with influenza and found to have afib and CHF.
She has had SOB since then and has beeen evaluated by pulmonary and cardiology.
She has left sided chest pain when she coughs which then lingers on for longer.
She has been having orthopnea and PND the last few nights and has noticed that her legs have been swelling.
She has also been having large amounts of anxiety related to her breathing.
No other substances.
She has also been having sucidal ideations since she feels she is so heavy and her medical problems are too difficult to control, she would not like to live longer.
She was given Percocet for back pain and ativan for anxiety.
+ chronic back pain and pain in her feet.
+ for nausea and vomiting daily for the last 4 days.

PFTs with a mild restrictive defect 9. h/o hyperglycemia 10. h/o ETOH abuse 11. w/u for sleep apnea   Social History: Single mother of two children (aged 19 and 12).
Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: VS: Temp: 97.8 BP: 124/54 HR:76 RR:24 O2sat 95% 2L Weight: 319 lb (was 305 in [**3-3**]) BMI 62 GEN: pleasant, talkive, comfortable, NAD sitting in chair HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, MMM, op without lesions NECK: no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd though hard to tell with body habitus, no carotid bruits, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules RESP: RLL crackles with dullness to percussion.
No wheezes heard  CV: [**Last Name (un) 3526**], [**Last Name (un) 3526**], S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly; refused rectal EXT: mild non-pitting peripheral edema SKIN: healed burn wound on back.
Enlarging small right pleural effusion with right lower lobe atelectasis versus infiltrate.
No pulmonary embolus.
Soft tissue stranding and lymphadenopathy in the tissues anterior and contiguous with the thyroid, which is similar to what was seen in [**12-29**], but again suggesting acute inflammation.
Marked soft tissue swelling involving the entire pharynx, as well as the supraglottic and the upper infraglottic airway.
No organized fluid collection identified or bony involvement.
[**5-31**] ct sinus: IMPRESSION: Although endotracheal intubation confounds interpretation, extensive opacification with multiple air-fluid levels among the paranasal sinuses can be seen in pansinusitis.
No evidence of associated bony destruction.
ECHO [**2184-6-15**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical  quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No  aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild  (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild mitral regurgitation with grossly normal valve morphology.
Preserved global biventricular systolic function.
The severity of mitral regurgitation is similar.
Brief Hospital Course: 40 year old female with morbid obesity, CHF, and atrial fibrillation here with progressive SOB, and ETOH relapse.
# Dyspnea/hypercarbic respitory failure: The patient has poor pulmonary status which is multifactorial from heart failure, obesity induced restrictive disease, and resultant obesity-hypoventilation syndrome.
The patient presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure (osa and hypoventilation from obesity).
The patient failed non-invasive ventilation (due to progressive hypercarbia) and required intubation on [**2184-5-26**].
The patient's baseline obesity hypoventilation, and continued hypercarbia made liberation from the ventilator difficult.
As fluid overload may have been contributing to her failure to wean from the vent, she was aggressively diuresed with a lasix drip.
After placement of her trach, she continued to be diuresed with IV lasix prn with careful observation of her electrolytes given a history of contraction alkalosis.
She did have 2 episodes of pulling her trach partly out, thought to be in the setting of increased anxiety.
# CHF: On admission, the patient had increased weight, hypoxia and elevated BNP which pointed to CHF excerbation.
As her fluid status contributed to her respiratory failure she was aggressively diuresed with lasix drip.
The patient had alkalosis at times, likely related to her diuresis, but this improved with KCL and diamox prn.
When her contraction alkalosis worsened her lasix was stopped and it was felt she was adequately diuresed at that time.
An echo this admission showed diastolic dysfunction.
# Fevers: The patient continued to spike fevers and during her course was noted to have GNR bacteremia (Fusobacterium).
Given this organism a concern for peritonsillar abscess and sinusitis was raised.
She did not have evidence of peritonsillar abscess, though her infection was attributed to sinusitis given a positive CT head.
She also likely had a pneumonia given her cxr during her course.
She was given emperic flagyl but spiked fevers while on this.
Her CVL was changed on [**6-18**] due to persistent temperature spikes.
She had LENI's to exclude DVT as a possible fever source.
# Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of Afib/flutter and is on CCB, BB and coumadin at home.
Here, she became modestly hypotensive while on sedation and her calcium channel [**Month/Year (2) 7005**] was held; she was only treated with metoprolol given hypotension and was intermittently on heparin which was later stopped due to hematuria.
She never developed RVR and remained stable on a beta-[**Last Name (LF) 7005**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] her calcium channel [**First Name3 (LF) 7005**] was stopped.
# Alcoholism: The patient has a history of alcohlism and relapsed.
Quetiapine tid provided excellent control of anxiety and agitation, with as needed lorazepam for rare agitation.
# Acute renal failure: The patient presented with a Cr of 1.2.
This was likely due to her initial presentation of vomiting and diarrhea.
