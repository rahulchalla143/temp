Admission Date:  [**2150-10-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2150-10-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2091-12-15**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Ivp Dye, Iodine Containing  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**] Chief Complaint: LLL diverticulitis  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization right IJ placement right hematoma evacuation and right pseudoaneurysm repair [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) **] Drain placement  History of Present Illness: 58 yoF w/ CAD s/p MI initially presented to the ED with 3 days of LLQ pain, sharp, no radiation, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**].
It was associated with mild nausea (no vomiting) and subjective fevers, no chills.
Abd CT showed diverticulitis and she was started on levo/flagyl.
In the ED, she developed SOB/wheeze after the PO contrast; it was felt that she was having an asthma exacerbation in the setting of possible contrast aspiration, and she she was given IV Solumedrol with good results.
On transfer to the floor, she was noted to be markedly hypertensive 200/100 associated with a left-sided frontal headache, nausea, and bilateral eye "blurriness."
She received total of 50 mg IV hydralazine with minimal effect.
Currently, she notes left upper chest pressure, no radiation, associated with shortness of breath and nausea.
No diaphoresis, lightheadedness, or palpitations.
The pain is usually exertional.
She is able to walk 1 block and up one flight of stairs before becoming SOB, no recent change.
(+) orthopnea, (+) mild LE edema.
(+) chronic lower extremity numbness/paresthesias (attributed to peripheral neuropathy).
Physical Exam: Admission PE: VS: Tc 98, bp 210/105, HR 112, resp 20, 98% RA Gen: anxious, middle-aged female, appears unconfortable HEENT: anicteric, normal conjunctiva, OMMM, OP clear, neck supple, no LAD, JVP ~ 9 cm Cardiac: tachycardic, regular, II/VI SM at apex Pulm: Slightly decreased air movement throughout, although no wheezing appreciated.
Moderate tenderness in LLQ with voluntary guarding, no rebound.
Ext: Trace LE edema ankles bilaterally.
Minimal stranding at the junction of the left and sigmoid colon, probably representing uncomplicated mild diverticulitis.
Left renal parenchymal nonobstructing stone.
Bilateral low-density renal lesions, probably cysts.
No evidence of retroperitoneal extension of this hemorrhage.
No evidence for acute diverticulitis.
Multiple bilateral low-density renal foci are incompletely characterized on this non-contrast examination .
CXR [**2150-10-11**]: There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, with mild unfolding of the aorta.
There is upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with interstitial edema.
There is prominent soft tissue density in the region of the azygos vein, raising the question of right-sided fluid overload.
No focal infiltrate or effusion is identified.
Echo ([**2150-10-13**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Renal U/S ([**2150-10-13**]) IMPRESSION: No renal stones or hydronephrosis.
There was mild plaque in the LMCA, LAD and LCX.
The LAD was mildly calcific.
The RCA was non-dominant and without notable disease.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated systemic arterial pressures of 218 mmHg at systole and 105 mmHg at diastole.
Cardiac catheterization was uneventful, but the patient developed a right groin hematoma noted after discontinuation of the arterial sheath.
This was complicated by relative hypotension and bradycardia which responded to IV fluids, dopamine gtt and atropine.
She underwent  emergent CT scanning showing a large right groin hematoma without evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
Recommend aggressive modification of cardiovascular risk factors.
Marked hypertension, consider renal MRI to rule out renal artery stenosis.
Marked systemic arterial hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 58 yo female p/w initially with diverticulitis developed hypertensive emergency with NSTEMI at the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] s/p cardiac cath (reviewed clean coronaries), but developed expanding right femoral hematoma s/p hematoma evacuation and pseudoaneurysm repair by vascular surgery.
1) Hypertensive emergency: She developed hypertensive emergency at the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with BP 200/100, that was not responsive to nitroglycerin, morphine, and hydralazine.
She associates this pain with nausea and headache.
No acute ECG change (although LBBB), tropinin peak at 0.45.  pt was ruled in for NSTEMI.
it's unclear if pt's hypertension cause her MI (although she had clean coronaries) or if HTN was secondary event due to cardiac pain.
We started her on metoprolol and [**Last Name (un) **] post cath, and titrate up as tolerated;  She was discharged on metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **], losartan 50mg qday, and HCTZ 25mg qday for BP control.
2) Chest pain/NSTEMI: in setting of hypertensive emergency, her tropinin peaked at 0.45.
She has risk factors for CAD including DM2 (on insulin) and HTN but she denies any history of MI or requiring cardiac catheterization in the past.
Echo showed nl EF>55%, and no global or regional wall motion abnormalies.
We controlled her blood pressure as outlined above, and sublingual nitroglycerin for symptomatic chest pain, which she didn't have any after cath.
Checked HA1c and lipid profile.
3) Diverticulitis: Pt initally came in with LLQ pain and was diagnosed with diverticulitis, and she was started on levoquin and flagyl for 7 days and kept on a clear liquid diet, which was advanced to regular low residue diet on day 5;  She remained abdominal pain free after being on that treatment .
4) s/p right femoral hematoma evacuation and pseudoaneurysm repair: patient developed expanding right femoral hematoma s/p cardiac cath on [**2150-10-12**], which required emergent vascular surgery repair and evacuation.
She developed hypercarbic respiratory failure [**2-26**] to sedation during the procedure, she was followed with serial ABG, and her mental status and respiratory status improved.
5) ARF: patient had a mild jump of Cr post cath (prior 1.1), now 1.4 and 1.5, urine lytes sent Urine Na 16, cr 107; Fena 0.17 and FeUrea 9.89% c/w pre-renal; she received mild IV hydration, and her Cr was back to baseline.
7) Type II DM:  Continued NPH 70/30, however titrated down to a lower dose 15 Units [**Hospital1 **] (when patient was NPO and on clear liquid diet) and ISS, fingersticks QID; checked HA1c which is 7.3 on [**2150-10-14**]; .
8) Asthma: Currently asymptomatic and clinically her lungs sound clear; Continued flovent and albuterol/atrovent .
9) Peripheral Neuropathy: Continued Neurontin renally dosed.
11) Code: Full during this admission  Medications on Admission: Home Meds: Albuterol inhaler Hyzaar 50 QD Neurontin  400 QAM, 800 QPM Humulin 70/30  65AM, 35U QHS Lasix 40 po qd Xanax 0.5 QPM Ultracet [**Hospital1 **] PRN pain .
