Gastrointestinal:  The patient was admitted to the Medical Wards for further management of her GI bleeding.
Over the next 12 hours, the patient was noted to have two more episodes of dark magenta stools with clots and had been transfused a total of two units of packed red blood cells.
An upper endoscopy was performed and a 1 cm antral ulcer was identified without any active bleeding which was felt to the be the source of the patient's bleeding (upper endoscopy was performed as the patient's BUN was elevated and it was felt that an upper source of bleeding may be possible).
The patient returned to the floor but continued to have multiple episodes of magenta stools per rectum, which progressively became more bright and red in quality, concerning for a lower GI source of bleeding.
