Admission Date:  [**2137-10-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-10-22**]  Date of Birth:  [**2057-5-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Bactrim / Nsaids  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**] Chief Complaint: shortness of breath, productive cough  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PICC line placement   History of Present Illness: The patient is an 80-year-old female with a past medical history significant for chronic bronchiectesis, MV-repair/tricuspid valve replacement, CHF, and atrial fibrillation who presented to to her primary care physician's office at [**Company 191**] just prior to this hospital admission complaining of worsening dyspnea and cough.
At baseline, the patient has moderate amount of yellow sputum and is on 2.5 L oxygen via home NC with typical oxygen saturations ranging from 95-96%.
Prior to presentation she describes having 3-4 days of extreme fatigue, nausea, weakness and worsening sputum production that was darker yellow-greenish in color along with a more frequent cough.
Despite her presentation, she had no significant WBC elevations.
She also had evidence of atrial fibrillation on EKG.
Following admission to MICU the patient continued to have increased work of breathing and productive cough with low oxygen saturations and was felt to be in hypoxic respiratory distress with some hypercarbia as well as ABG showed a pO2 of 63mmHg and pCO2 of 49.
She has a history of resistant pseudomonas so there was some concern for re-infection, especially since gram negative rods were found on sputum culture.
In general, she stated she was feeling "much better" with more energy and less shortness of breath at time of her transfer.
Despite her CHF history she did not seem to have any signs of fluid overload as her JVD was 5-6cm and she had no crackles on lung exam and no pedal edema.
She was continued on her usual Coumadin therapy for her atrial fibrillation and tricuspid valve replacement but she had to hold her Coumadin for a few evenings due to a high INR.

Atrial fibrillation, status post AVJ ablation and DDD pacer 3.
Congestive heart failure (EF 30% in [**2135**]) 4.
Bronchiectasis with presumed pseudomonal colonization ([**2135-12-19**] and treated with ceftazidime and azithromycin): Previously suffered exacerbations in [**Month (only) **] and [**2135-8-19**] that were treated with meropenem/ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime as outpatient 6.
Depression 7.
Previously, she drank one drink/day but no ETOH now for many years.
There is a negative family history of colon cancer, breast cancer, diabetes, and premature coronary artery disease.
Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM: VS: 97.6, HR 81, BP 128/50, RR20s, 93% (92-97%) on 4L NC GENERAL: no distress at rest, mild nasal flaring with respirations but no accessory muscle use noted, alert and oriented to person, place and time, pleasant demeanor HEENT: moist mucosal membranes, EOMI, OP clear of exudates, mild erythema at posterior pharynx Neck: JVD at 5-6cm, supple, no thyromegaly, no lymphadenopathy CVS: Loud S2 noted, regular S1, pulse is irregular,no murmurs/rubs/gallops Pulm: Diffuse coarse rhonchi throughout lung fields bilaterally and decreased lung sounds at LLL.
No dullness to percussion.
[**2137-10-14**] EKG :  Rate 80 and ventricular paced with slow atrial fibrillation noted, no ST changes.
[**2137-10-14**] CXR: Chronic interstitial lung disease with increased right upper lobe and LLL opacities which may represent atypical pneumonia or atelectasis.
Evidence of bronchiectasis is better seen on CT. Wedge-shaped opacity behind the left heart appears slightly more consolidative; while this could represent atelectasis related to impacted airways, if the patient had fever, this could also represent consolidation.
No new area of consolidation is noted.
No evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.
A left-sided transvenous pacemaker with right atrial and right ventricular leads remain in place.
[**2137-10-22**] 05:58AM BLOOD WBC-10.6 RBC-4.08* Hgb-11.7* Hct-35.2* MCV-86 MCH-28.6 MCHC-33.2 RDW-13.4 Plt Ct-324, Plt Ct-324 [**2137-10-22**] 05:58AM BLOOD Glucose-80 UreaN-14 Creat-0.5 Na-137 K-4.2 Cl-98 HCO3-35* AnGap-8, Calcium-9.4 Phos-3.0 Mg-2.1  Brief Hospital Course: In summary, the patient is an 80-year-old female with chronic bronchiectasis and home oxygen dependence, MV-repair/tricuspid valve replacement, and atrial fibrillation who presented with fevers, worsening cough, and shortness of breath which progressed to hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of suspected new acute PNA which was corroborated by CXR.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: At time of transfer to the regular medicine [**Hospital1 **] from the MICU the patient's oxygen requirements had improved and her hypoxia appeared to be resolving well.
She had an ABG with pO2 63 and pCO2 of 49 in MICU shortly after admission consistent with hypoxic failure mixed with hypercarbia.
Patient has chronic bronchiectasis which was initially noted in the late [**2108**] per patient and on further discussion with the patient's pulmonologist it was noted that the root of her bronchiectasis dates back to a severe pertussis infection many years ago.
She has had repeated PNAs and URIs since that time with progressive decompensation and shortness of breath leading to home oxygen dependency.
She progressed steadily and her shortness of breath improved throughout her hospital course with ongoing antibiotics and resolution of her PNA and additional albuterol nebulizers and chest PT.
# Pneumonia: Despite no leukocytosis, she presented with worsened cough from her baseline, respiratory distress (RR >30), fevers to 101 range, and CXR with consolidations noted at LLL and RUL which were all suggestive of a new PNA.
The patient was also known to be colonizated with Pseudomonas in the past and she had  been treated in the past several times with various antibiotics.
Per records, her last recorded sputum had grown out GNR (non-pseudomonas) sensitive to Ceftazidime, Levofloxacin, Meropenem, and Zosyn.
Given these sensitivity patterns and her significant underlying lung pathology with bronchiectasis she was continued on Levofloxacin initally for coverage for atypicals/Legionalla PNA but once urine legionella returned negative the levofloxacin was discontinued.
She continued her chest PT and spirometry at the bedside and she was given daily mucinex, nebulizers alongside her antibiotics and her cough and phlegm production gradually improved.
Her fevers gradually tapered as well and by time of discharge she had been afebrile for several days.
# Bronchiectasis: As mentioned, her initial bronchiectasis and pulmonary scarring was secondary to an older Pertussis infection > 15 years ago.
On this admission she had no hemoptysis noted but cough and baseline sputum were much worse than usual at admission per patient.
She had JVD=3-4cm on exam, no crackles on lung exam, and no evidence of pedal edema to indicate volume overload.
She was in no apparent CHF distress despite her acute PNA.
# Atrial fibrillation: She was placed on continuous telemetry monitoring and several EKGs were assessed as well.
Anticoagulation was continued with Coumadin with her INR goal kept at 2.0 because of her extensive bronchiectasis.
She had no chest pain or angina during her hospital stay.
# Anxiety: The patient had well controlled anxiety levels throughout her hospital course despite the undoubted stress of being admitted to an intensive care unit in repiratory distress.
PO intake was encouraged and IVFs were used sparingly due to her CHF history.
# Prophylaxis Issues: She was continued on Coumadin for anticoagulation which also provided DVT prevention as well, protonix was given for GI protection and Senna and Colace to promote stool regularity.
Please flush PICC line with normal saline [**4-27**] mL flushes PRN and heparin 10 units/mL [**2-20**] mL PRN for line maintenance.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pneumonia Dyspnea / Hypoxic respiratory failure Bronchiectasis .
Secondary: Coronary Artery Disease Systolic congestive heart failure Primary hyperparathyroidism Osteoporosis Atrial fibrillation s/p ablation and pacemaker Depression   Discharge Condition: At time of discharge the patient was clinically doing well with stable vital signs and her oxygen requirements had returned to her usual baseline on 2.5L oxygen via nasal cannula which was her pre-admission home oxygen requirement.
The patient's cough had lessened in severity and she was in no distress.
You were admitted with worsening shortness of breath and a productive cough and found to have a pneumonia.
Your shortness of breath was so severe that you needed to be admitted to the medical intensive care unit for a few days prior to transferring to a general medical floor once you were more stable.
Your additional medical issues which include atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, depression, hyperparathyroidism and a history of congestive heart failure were all monitored and managed during your hospitalization.
A script with instructions for your blood to be drawn at home on Wednesday [**10-23**] has been included in your discharge paperwork.
Because of your history congestive heart failure it is important to weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs as this may indicate fluid overload in your body.
Please call your primary care physician or return to the Emergency Department immediately if you experience fever, chills, sweats, dizziness, lightheadedness, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, worsening of your baseline cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody or dark stools, leg swelling or pain, numbness, weakness, or tingling.
