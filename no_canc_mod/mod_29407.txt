INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 23-year-old gentleman who has tracheal stenosis and tracheomalacia and has been dependent on a tracheostomy tube.
I did flexible bronchoscopy through the endotracheal tube and I could see that there was a fair amount of granulation tissue at the left mainstem bronchus.
There was very severe malacia.
There was minimal bleeding.
Evaluation of the airways revealed normal right main stem bronchus and right upper lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe segmental bronchi.
On the left, the takeoff for the left main stem bronchus appeared to be completely occluded with a combination of granulation tissue and malacia.
Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before and after venous access documenting vessel patency.
There were no immediate complications.
Interventional pulmonology attempted to reinsert the trachestomy the next day but was unsuccessful secondary to stenosis of the stoma.
