[**3-28**] LENIs: IMPRESSION: Normal wall-to-wall color flow and augmentation of the examined left lower extremity veins.
Compression could not be assessed due to patient body habitus and intolerance.
No definite evidence of deep venous thrombosis on this extremely limited exam.
[**3-28**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Dense atelectasis of the left lung base, less likely pneumonia.
There is no left pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Left costophrenic angle is not fully imaged; however, pleural density involving the left lateral hemithorax in the lower lobe is longstanding and likely represents pleural thickening and/or effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia.
Left lower lobe pleural density likely represents thickened pleura and/or effusion.
[**3-31**] LLE US: FINDINGS: Superficial ultrasound of the left lower extremity was performed using a linear array transducer.
There is subcutaneous edema identified in these regions, but no drainable collection seen.
IMPRESSION: Subcutaneous edema, without visualized abscess formation or drainable collection.
Brief Hospital Course: 53 year old male with PMH of achondroplasia, morbid obesity, obesity hypoventilation syndrome c/b pulmonary hypertension and right sided congestive heart failure presenting with sepsis, including fevers, hypoxia/elevated respiratory rate, and elevated WBC count requiring ICU level care.
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # Leg cellulitis:  noted to have increase erythema, warmth, and swelling of left lower extremity suspicious for cellulitis/erysipelas.
Given the clinical severity, surgery was called for concern of necrotizing fascitis and clindamycin was added.

LENIs were negative for DVT or any drainable collection.

# Respiratory distress/Pneumonia: Has history of recurrent pneumonia with CXR at [**Hospital1 **] reportedly consistent with R-sided infiltrate prior to transfer here.
INACTIVE CHRONIC ISSUES BY PROBLEM: # Hypertension: Initially held home metoprolol and losartan given borderline pressures, however these were restarted prior to discharge.
