Admission Date:  [**2141-4-16**]     Discharge Date:  [**2141-4-22**]  Date of Birth:   [**2103-5-24**]     Sex:  F  Service:  [**Location (un) **] HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus complicated by end-stage renal disease, status post living-related renal transplant in [**2140-10-31**], who presented on [**4-16**] with complaints of persistent nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for any hematuria, dysuria, flank pain, pain over her graft site, hematemesis, bright red blood per rectum, or substernal chest pain.
This was thought to be consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis.
Of note, on admission the patient ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a positive troponin.
She was noted to have lateral electrocardiogram changes but denied any substernal chest pain.
The patient was seen by the Cardiology Service, who felt that this was secondary to demand ischemia.
Upon transfer to the Medical [**Hospital1 **], the patient continued to complain of diarrhea and poor oral intake.
End-stage renal disease secondary to diabetes, status post living-related renal transplant (sister) in [**2140-3-31**].
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2140-5-1**] and coronary artery bypass graft.
Type 1 diabetes mellitus since the age of five.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the patient had bilateral eyelid edema.
She had a left surgical pupil.
Her mucous membranes were moist.
Her neck was supple without lymphadenopathy of jugular venous distention.
On cardiovascular examination she had a regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur over the left lower sternal border.
Her extremities were warm without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
She was noted to have a healing small left heel ulcer.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   She had a chest x-ray which was negative for an acute cardiopulmonary process.
She had  a KUB which revealed no evidence of obstruction of perforation.
She had left axis deviation.
She had T wave inversions in leads V5 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 37-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, status post living-related renal transplant, coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass graft who presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, diabetic ketoacidosis, and demand ischemia.
She did not have any evidence of acute rejection at any time.
Her decreased FK 506 level was felt to be secondary to her decreased oral intake.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Per the Cardiology Service, the patient's increased troponin was likely secondary to demand ischemia with a small silent myocardial infarction.
She did not have any evidence of arrhythmia or additional ischemia.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient's complaints were felt to be consistent with a viral gastroenteritis.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient's diabetic ketoacidosis initially resolved on the insulin drip and aggressive hydration.
We initially maintained her on a regular insulin sliding-scale with a reduced insulin dose given her dramatically decreased oral intake.
The patient subsequently went into diabetic ketoacidosis for a second time given her poorly controlled hyperglycemia.
However, the patient was noted to have early morning hypoglycemia.
Diabetic ketoacidosis.
End-stage renal disease, status post living-related renal transplant in [**2140-10-31**].
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft.
Retinopathy with bilateral blindness.
Peripheral vascular disease.
