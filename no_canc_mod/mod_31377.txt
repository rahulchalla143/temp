**FINAL REPORT [**2161-4-26**]**    Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2161-4-26**]):    NO GROWTH.
Subtle lateral right basilar opacity seen on the frontal view is new since the prior study and may represent early/mild consolidation.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION: Ill-defined subtle lateral right basilar opacity seen on the frontal view, may be due to early mild consolidation.
Alternatively, findings could be due to enlarging right base pulmonary nodule seen on prior CT.
--- Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2161-4-21**] Final Report FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-20**], there is again a somewhat ill-defined area of increased opacification at the right base, concerning for pneumonia.
Small area of opacification is also seen in the retrocardiac region, though this could well represent merely atelectatic change.
Heterogenous peribronchial infiltration in the right middle and lower lobes is unchanged.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal.
No pleural effusions are present.
No evidence of adenopathy.
IMPRESSION: Multifocal, likely atypical, pneumonia is unchanged.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.
No pleural effusions, no hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
---  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 79627**] is a pleasant 64 yom with severe COPD, schizophrenia, pulmonary hypertension who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with worsening cough, dyspnea, and hypoxia over the last 3 days.
Hypoxia/cough: Found at home by visiting nurse satting in upper 70%s/RA; complained of 3 day history of cough and dyspnea upon admission.
Most likely due to COPD exacerbation vs community-acquired pneumonia.
CXR showed vague, persistent right lower lobe infiltrate possibly consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
Cardiac ischemia was unlikely based on negative cardiac enzymes and lack of chest pain.
Somnolence/lethargy most likely due to hypercarbia, with possible element of obstructive sleep apnea.
Patient snored during sleep and appeared to have poor, shallow air movement.
Tobacco abuse: We re-emphasized the importance of smoking cessation in preventing progression of the patient's COPD and in decreasing the risk of future infections and hospitalizations.
Albuterol Sulfate 90 mcg/Actuation HFA Aerosol Inhaler Sig: Two (2)  Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: nizhoni  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation Atypical pneumonia  SECONDARY: Schizophrenia Hypertension Pulmonary hypertension Mental retardation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes Level of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital because you were coughing and had trouble breathing.
We believe you had a flare of your COPD and a pneumonia.
