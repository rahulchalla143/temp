Superficial rash over her face, and trunk, and legs.
RESPIRATORY STATUS: The infant had no respiratory distress    immaturity.
She did have some occasional mild apnea, but    this was not a problem or issue for her, and certainly not    an issue that continued through her nursery course.
HEAD ULTRASOUND: The infant had a left germinal matrix    hemorrhage and a right cortex cyst.
The infant's    evaluation for systemic candidiasis, in terms of eye exam,    was also negative.
She had some splenic cysts on her    initial abdominal ultrasound.
The infant was transferred to [**Hospital 328**] Hospital Special Care Nursery for continuation of her convalescent neonatal course.
