No M/R LUNGS: Diffuse crackles B/L ABD: soft, NT/ND.
No femoral bruits.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis to akinesis with some preservation of lateral wall motion.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.

Brief Hospital Course: Patient is an 83 year-old female with HTN, DMII, HL, CVA, CAD who presented to the Emergency Department from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with an acute ST elevation MI in the anterior leads.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Patient with known 3V disease presented with acute ST elevation MI.
Extensive discussion took place between patient's daughter (health care proxy) and cardiology team, and it was decided that given comorbidities, risks/benefits or coronary intervention, and most importantly, goals of care/patient's wishes, medical management of MI was pursued.
Patient received 10-20mg IV Lasix on admission days 1 and 2 for diuresis, given marked crackles on exam and elevated JVP.
Patient was without chest pain during hospital stay, though difficult to assess completely given baseline dementia.
MILD LEUKOCYTOSIS/HYPOTENSION ?SEPSIS Patient presented with mild leukocytosis and hypotension in setting of acute MI.
Other sources of possible sepsis were pursued and were unrevealing (UA, Blood Cxs, CXR).
CXR with 6cm opactiy in R apex, to be followed as outpatient (Patient's PCP's office, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 14959**] at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, notified on [**2194-11-15**]); clinically, patient without signs/symptoms of PNA - they will follow.
Leukocytosis resolved without antibiotic therapy, and patient remained afebrile.
Per daughter, this was likely due to change in setting.
DIABETES Strict glycemic control was maintained with QID fingersticks and insulin sliding scale.
Quetiapine 200 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime): Please have your EKG checked to ensure no QT prolongation while on this medication.
