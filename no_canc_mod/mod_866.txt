History of Present Illness: This 74 year old male with severe COPD and extensive cardiac history in [**2171-10-5**].
Since surgery in [**2171-10-5**], patient has always complained of a sternal click and incisional discomfort.

Severe emphysema.
He did well for about 30 days following which he got an upper respiratory infection resulting in severe coughing and a sterile dehiscence of the sternum.
A CT scan was obtained which showed left upper lobe lung lesions which could be inflammatory or early malignancy.
The air leak subsequently infected the sterile sternum and the plates and resulted in a secondary infection requiring removal of the plates and packing of the wound for awhile.
He was susequently extubated on [**3-6**] and had some coughing episodes and then sudden increased drainage in his chest tube and development of hematoma under his pectoral flap and massive hemoptysis.
He returned to the Operating Room emergently for mediastinal exploration, evacuation of the hematoma and control of pulmonary bleeding.
He had some dysphagia and a Dobhoff tube was placed for tube feedings.
He twice had a significant leukocytosis, without an obvious source and then this resolved Vancomycin will continue for 8 weeks total (through [**4-27**]) and ID followup is arranged.
The sternal wound is clean and healing and the two JP drains remain in situ, being managed by the Plastic Surgical service.
