Admission Date: [**2191-2-25**]        Discharge Date: [**2191-2-26**]  Date of Birth:  [**2119-7-13**]        Sex:  M  Service:  TRA   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71 year old male with mild dementia who was a pedestrian hit by a truck at 40 miles an hour, thrown 20 feet away with loss of consciousness and laceration of the head.
He was combative at the scene with worsening mental status.
He was found to have a flail chest on both sides and he was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
The pupils were 2 mm and nonreactive.
There was significant laceration on the patient's forehead and head down to the skull; however, no evidence of skull fracture on visual inspection.
Abdomen seems mildly distended.
There is visibly inverted and shortened right leg with unstable hip, unstable left knee, bruising over the left hand.
Mild mental retardation.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The Foley was placed easily; however, only a minimal amount of urine was obtained, so the Foley was left in place.
Orthopedic Service was consulted immediately and recommended external fixation of both pelvis and bilateral lower extremities.
Given seemingly hemodynamic stability, the Interventional Radiology attending wished to attempt a CT scan before proceeding to angio.
A quick scan of the chest and abdomen was performed that revealed still a pneumothorax on the left side.
The CT scan revealed, as above, persistent pneumothorax on the left which was fixed with another chest tube, hemothorax on the right with significant bilateral contusions.
There were multiple rib fractures on the right, some mesenteric stranding, partial rupture of the right kidney and the Foley looked like it was in the bladder.
No other abnormalities were noted.
The bony abnormalities included, as above, rib fractures, bilateral acetabular fractures, pelvic fracture.
At that point, the patient was brought into the Angio Suite where angio was performed (I forgot to mention that a left subclavian Cordis as well as a left femoral Cordis were placed emergently from the initial workup).
The patient had an angio which revealed slight bleeding from the right lower pole of the kidney which was embolized.
It also revealed a small aneurysm in the spleen which was unclear whether it was a new or old finding and it was embolized as well.
No other significant abnormalities were found.
A new set of labs was sent which showed continuous coagulopathy and anemia with a hematocrit of 20.
He had desaturations in the mid 80s.
A chest x-ray done emergently revealed no significant pneumothorax, but significant bilateral contusions, edema as well as the fluid overload.
Rib fractures.
Bilateral pulmonary contusions.
Bilateral acetabular fractures.
Left knee fracture.
History of mental retardation.
Anemia due to bleeding into ?
Acute lung injury.
