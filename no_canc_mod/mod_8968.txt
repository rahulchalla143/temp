The patient denies any fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, or polyuria.
The patient has noted decreased urine output for the past several days.
She has chronic renal insufficiency, but is not yet undergoing hemodialysis.
Type 2 diabetes for approximately 20 years.
Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 5.8.
Hydradenitis suppurativa.
Status post incision and drainage of a perirectal abscess.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
The oropharynx was dry with no lesions.
There were dry mucous membranes.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed a question of a retrocardiac opacity.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to Medical Intensive Care Unit for treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis and severe acidemia with acute-on-chronic renal failure.
The Renal Service was immediately consulted for urgent hemodialysis for her elevated hyperkalemia and her metabolic acidosis.
Sources of why the patient's slipped into diabetic ketoacidosis were sought.
Her enzymes were cycled to rule out possible myocardial infarction.
Liver function tests showed the patient to have elevated amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatitis which was thought to be a possible cause of her diabetic ketoacidosis.
On the evening of admission, the patient spiked a temperature to 102.
Upon closer physical examination, the patient was found to have a right breast abscess which was most likely the cause of her having slipped into diabetic ketoacidosis.
She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, and Surgery was consulted for a possible incision and drainage of the abscess.
She was dialyzed for a second time on the second hospital day as she was still showing symptoms of uremia with asterixis on examination.
She had a CT scan on the second hospital day to look for possible retroperitoneal bleed given a 10-point hematocrit drop overnight, as well as to image the pancreas given her elevated amylase and lipase.
The pancreas only showed some mild stranding, most notably around the pancreatic head, and it was postulated that the patient may have had some gallstone pancreatitis.
She received 2 units of packed red blood cells on the second hospital day for her 10-point hematocrit drop, and her hematocrit stabilized.
There was no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed on CT.  On the third hospital day, the patient had incision and drainage of the right breast abscess by Surgery.
The Gram stain from her abscess showed only gram-positive cocci.
Therefore, ciprofloxacin was discontinued as there was no evidence of Pseudomonas.
She had [**Hospital6 407**] after discharge for help with dressing changes of the right breast abscess.
Diabetic ketoacidosis.
Acute-on-chronic renal failure.
