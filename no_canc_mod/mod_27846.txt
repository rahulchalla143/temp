Four radiographs of the pelvis and bilateral hips demonstrate acute fracture.
Atherosclerotic calcifications are evident.
No previous studies are available for comparison.
IMPRESSION:  No fracture.
LUMBO-SACRAL SPINE (AP & LAT)  [**2149-11-11**] 2:15 PM  LUMBO-SACRAL SPINE (AP & LAT)  Reason: rt hip and rt side pain  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 76 year old woman with s/p CABG REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: rt hip and rt side pain HISTORY: Pain.
Two radiographs of the lumbar spine demonstrate multilevel degenerative endplate change and intervertebral body disc space narrowing.
No spondylolisthesis or fracture is evident.
Atherosclerotic calcifications are evident.
Curvilinear calcific density projecting over the left lower quadrant is not readily identified on subsequent pelvic and hip radiographs and is of uncertain clinical significance.
IMPRESSION:  Lumbar spondylosis without spondylolisthesis or fracture.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-7**], there is still substantial opacification at the left base consistent with atelectasis and pleural effusion.
Pleural fluid at the right base is also seen in this patient status post CABG with dual pacer leads in place.
No evidence of acute pneumonia.
Left ventricular function.
Mild-moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Mildly depressed LVEF.
Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe inferolateral wall hypokinesis and mild inferior wall hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure has also increased.
She was found to be in complete heart block with an escape of 40.
She was seen by ortho for a fall while in the ICU, and plain films of her hips and L-spine were taken, there was no evidence of fracture.
