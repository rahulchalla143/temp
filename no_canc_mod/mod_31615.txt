SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST: Thin linear lucencies adjacent to the liver likely represent pneumoperitoneum as seen on subsequent CT. Femoral hemodialysis catheter is partially seen.
No focal consolidation, congestive heart failure, pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.
A few left-sided rib fractures appear stable as compared to prior exam.
IMPRESSION: No focal consolidation.
Thin linear lucencies adjacent to the liver likely represent free air seen on subsequent CT.

Wet Read: SHfd FRI [**2149-9-12**] 1:58 PM Small pneumoperitoneum G tube baloon likely in the stomach.
Left perinephric stranding and small amount of fluid.
Bowel wall enhancement maybe secondary to hypoperfusion.

Final Report REASON FOR EXAM: Abdominal pain.
Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also submitted for interpretation.
FINDINGS:  CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The lung bases demonstrate emphysematous and chronic fibrotic changes.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Too small to characterize hypodensities in the dome of the liver are new since [**2139-8-25**].
A focal wedge- shaped hypodensity in the posterior aspect of the spleen with punctate calcification may represent prior trauma.
The pancreas is fatty infiltrated.
Multiple bilateral renal cysts are grossly stable since prior exam.
There has been interval increase in perinephric stranding and fluid on the left side.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and iliac vessels is seen.
Atherosclerotic calcifications at the origin of patent celiac and superior mesenteric arteries are seen.
A hemodialysis catheter extending from the left femoral vein to the junction of the inferior vena cava and right atrium is seen.
There is no lymphadenopathy.
There is no bowel obstruction.
No wall thickening is seen.
There is a gastric tube with the tip within the stomach.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Severe osteopenia and degenerative changes with no acute fracture are seen.
IMPRESSION: Small amount of pneumoperitoneum, especially within the superior aspect of the abdomen, likely secondary to recent gastric tube placement.
New left perirenal fluid and stranding is of unclear etiology, could perhaps be due to a recently passed stone.
Too small to characterize hypodensities in the dome of the liver are new since [**2139-8-25**].
Gangrenous necrosis and acute inflammation involving skin, subcutaneous soft tissue, and underlying bone.
Bony and soft tissue resection margin free of necrosis and acute inflammation.
Immediately proximal to the gangrenous area is an area of ulceration with circumferential necrosis.
The specimen is represented as follows: A = samples of gangrenous area with abutting non gangrenous tissues, B = necrotic ulcerated area, C = soft tissue margin, D = bone underlying necrotic area with attached tendon, E = bony margin.
By his/her signature above, the senior physician certifies that he/she personally conducted a gross and/or microscopic examination of the described specimens(s) and rendered or confirmed the diagnosis(es) related thereto.
The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.
Sepsis: Patient presented after spiking fevers at dialysis.
On presentation the patient was found to be in sepsis with multiple possible sources of infection.
The most likely source was thought to be his left groin HD line as he was only having fevers during HD.
Patient remained stable and afebrile through admission.
PVD: Patient has severe PVD with multiple toe amputations in the past and gangrenous toes currently.
He had persistent pain on his left foot needing IV morphine.
Nutrition: Patient with long history of dysphagia accompanied by severe reflux.
This resolved after IVF and it was thought to be due to dehydration and hemoconcentration.
This was thought to be anemia of chronic disease and also due to ESRD.
No obvious source of bleed was found, his Hct was 30 on discharge.
HTN: Patient had low blood pressure on admission and his hypotensive medications were held on admission.
Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: HD line infection induced sepsis  Secondary diagnosis: ESRD on HD Hypertension   Discharge Condition: good, abumbulating, afebrile   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted because you were found to have an infection in your blood that caused your blood pressure to be low.
You had another fever during a dialysis session and we decided to remove your catheter as this might have been the cause of your infection.
You continued to receive dialysis and did not have any more fevers after that one episode.
We added neutraphos to your medication regiment because of low phosphate in your blood.
