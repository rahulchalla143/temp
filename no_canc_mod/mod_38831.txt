No focal liver abnormality is identified.
No biliary dilatation is seen and the common duct measures 0.6 cm.
No hydronephrosis is seen.
No ascites is seen in the abdomen.
No findings to suggest a hepatic abscess.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
TEE [**2146-1-21**]:Conclusions  (prelim) PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
A right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is a large vegetation on the aortic valve.
No aortic valve abscess is seen.
Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Well seated and stable with good lealflet excursion with mild valvular regurgitation jets (Washing jets) 3.
Minimal gradients across the prosthetic valves in aortic and mitral position.
Progressive worsening of trisuspid regurgitation (central) after separation from CPB with associated systolic reversal of hepatic venous flow.
No lealfelt avulsion/restriction visualized, but necessitated re-institution of CPB.
Good leaflet excursion and mnimal gradient, with trace trisuspid regurgitation.
No ther change.
Echo [**1-26**] LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity.
Abnormal septal motion/position.
MITRAL VALVE: Bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis (MVR).
Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with septal hypokinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Normal LV cavity size with hypokinesis of the septum.
The movement of the septum appears abnormal - probably due to a combination of hypokinesis and post-pericardiotomy.
The right ventricle is borderline dilated and borderline hypodynamic.
There is moderate tricuspid regurgitation Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-1-20**], the patient is post-op with AVR, MVR and a tricuspid ring.
Ventricular function has improved, the amount of pericardial fluid has decreased.
Brief Hospital Course: She was admitted with enterococcus endocarditis sensitive to ampicillin and gentamicin.
RUQ U/S demonstrates b/l pleural effusions (no abscesses).
