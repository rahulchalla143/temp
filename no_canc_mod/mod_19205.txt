ST depressions resolved.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed  (ejection fraction 40-50 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the  midventricular and apical segments of the anterior septum and anterior free wall; the rest of the left ventricle is normal or hyperdynamic.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.

[**2167-1-13**] 01:46PM    CKMB 29* MBI 10.1* [**2167-1-13**] 08:35AM    CKMB 36* MBI 11.3* [**2167-1-13**] 02:31AM    CKMB 38* MBI 12.1*   Brief Hospital Course: This is a 73 yo M with a h/o tobacco use, hyperlipidemia, and fam hx CAD who presents with CP secondary to an anterior STEMI.
The patient developed a macular erythematous rash on his trunk and upper extremities.
He will need a CBC checked Q 2 wks x 3mo, then q 6 mo x 1yr, then yearly to look for Ticlid toxicity.
An echo done on [**1-13**] showed EF of 40-45 % with nl LA/RA, mild LVH, and hypokinesis of midventricular, apical, anterior free wall and apical septum.
Rash:  The patient developed a rash on his trunk after initiation of the plavix, atorvastatin, ASA, and metoprolol.
A dermatology consult agreed that it was likely a drug rash but could not determine the offending drug.
However, if the rash fails to resolve in one month, we will assume that plavix is not the offending [**Doctor Last Name 360**] and would recommend restarting the plavix at that point and discontinuing the Ticlid.
PVD: the patient has femoral and carotid bruits and a history of smoking.
We recommend that the patient have a carotid USN and ABIs as an outpatient.
