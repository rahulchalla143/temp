Subsequently her Na began to drop, she had some mental status changes and continued to have SOB.
On transfer patient complained of SOB at rest.
She had + orthopnea and was unable to lay flat.
Past Medical History: HTN DM Obesity Arthritis OSA- on Bipap GERD Neuropathy  Social History: lives alone, pet hamster, no tob/etoh/ivdu  Family History: No history of early cardiac death, HF.
+ CAD There are family members with HF but developed later in life.
Physical Exam: p115 bp 120/80 RR44 Pox 98%/4L O2 NC Gen-Dyspneic at rest HEENT- MMM, no JVD Neck-no appreciable JVD but neck obese CV- nl S1 S2 RRR no m/r/g Pulm- [**Month (only) **] BS at bilat bases [**1-31**] way up w/ rales, exp wheezes throughout Abd- +bs, soft obese, NT, ND, and tympanitic Ext- no edema, warm; mild tenderness in R calf, non-tender L calf   Pertinent Results: Na 133->137->120->135 Hct 30.9 dropped to 26.2.
No intraperitoneal, retroperitoneal or operative site hematoma detected.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
CT Chest [**2101-2-7**]: Non-contrast study shows bilateral pleural effusions, cardiomegaly and septal lines consistent with left ventricular heart failure.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe biventricular systolic dysfunction c/w diffuse process.
# [**Name (NI) 16356**] Pt was transferred from the ortho service to the medicine for concerns of SOB and hyponatremia.
On transfer the patient was extremely tachypneic and requiring 4L of oxygen.
Prior to her admission she had no SOB at baseline or exertion and did not require oxygen.
Her BP responded to the blood and however she continued to be tachycardic and hypoxic.
She continued to be tachypneic with hypoxia requiring oxygen via nasa canula.
Her HR remained in the 120' and became hyponatremic so medicaine was consulted.
CXR demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions.
Plan was for CTA however unfortunately patient lost IV access and therefore was only able to get nonconstrast chest CT.  We then got a D-dimer which was elevated as expected, but decided to go ahead and start the patient on heparin IV for possible PE.
The CT chest ended showing moderate sized bilateral pleural effusion and pulm edema.
The following LENI's were performed which showed no evidence of DVT.
Thus our suspicion at this point was CHF and we felt comfortbale stopping the heaprin.
ECHO was ordered and demonstrated severe biventricular dysfunction with EF of 20%.
It was unclear as to how the patient could have developed such severe HF over 1 year.
Also thought about ischemia in the setting of the surgery.
Another possibilty was either tachycardic induced cardiomyopathy or idiopathic.
It was noted that when reviewing the patient's old ECG's normally she had sinus tachycardia with prolonged PR interval.
ECG during hospital showed no ST changes but there was noted poor R wave progession.
When she was felt to be compensated BB was added for rate control and CHF management.
On discharge patient was compensated requiring no oxygen and able to ambulate without dyspnea.
She will need follow up ECHO to evaluate her EF and will also need to be followed up by the heart failure clinic for medical management, with follow-up PMIBI to assess for ischemic cause of CHF.
# [**Name (NI) 16357**] Pt had no history of CAD prior to admission.
P-MIBI from [**6-1**] showed no perfusion defects and normal EF.
She had no chest pain during her hospital stay.
CPK was elevated after surgery but this was likely secondary to the surgery itself, no MB or troponin was done.
After discharge patient should have a follow up P-MIBI to evaluate for coronary artery disease.
She had some mental status changes which were likely effected by the electrolyte disturbance and narcotics.
The hyponatremia was associated with her CHF and increased ADH in the setting of pain associated with surgery.
With restriction and resolution of CHF her Na returned to [**Location 1867**] levels of 135.
# Anemia-  On admission Hct was 30.9.
Fe studies revealed anemia of chronic disease with low Fe and elevated ferritin.
Her pain after the surgery was controlled by PCApump but this lead to mental status changes.
As her other medical problems resolved we restarted percocet for pain control along with lidoderm patch to facilitate ambulation.
She was able to tolerate PT and ambulation with good pain control.
Pt was ambulating with walker without difficulty.
Zolpidem Tartrate 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: sheryle House  Discharge Diagnosis: Spinal stenosis CHF DM Anemia Hyponatremia   Discharge Condition: Stable, neuro intact, wound healing primarily.
Able to ambulate without SOB or need of oxygen  Discharge Instructions: Keep wound clean and dry.
You also need to arrange with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16362**] for ECHO and stress test.
If you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, weight gain, lower extremity edema you should seek medical attention.
Followup Instructions: Follow-up as planned with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1742**]  Follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**] (Cardiologist [**Telephone/Fax (1) 16361**]) in [**3-3**] weeks for stress test.
