Admission Date:  [**2189-6-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2189-7-7**]  Date of Birth:   [**2128-11-14**]       Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 60-year-old female with questionable history of congestive heart failure, history of hypertension and transient ischemic attacks, was short of breath a few days prior to admission.
After three minutes she had a narrow complex rhythm.
A head CT MRI revealed a 1.5 cm meningioma in the left frontal area.
She was cleared by neurology and neurosurgery, and was felt to have no mass effect.
A TTE revealed ejection fraction of 40% with 3+ MR, consisting of multiple jets.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for history of hypertension, status post transient ischemic attack and a question of history of congestive heart failure.
She had past medical history of a left frontal meningioma.
No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
Cardiovascular exam, regular rate and rhythm with a 3 over 6 systolic ejection murmur.
No masses or hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities were without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
She presented to the catheterization laboratory area and was talking and then had acute severe pulmonary edema and was intubated in the catheterization laboratory, started on a nitro drip, and given 160 mg of Lasix IV.
LAD had a 60% lesion at the diagonal 1, left circumflex was 100% occluded.
Left ventricular ejection fraction was 40% with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] was consulted and the patient also had a carotid ultrasound which showed mild to moderate plaque on the right and the left internal carotid artery had 40% to 59% stenosis.
The patient, on [**6-18**], underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times three with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending, reverse saphenous vein graft to OM and posterior descending artery.
In the operating room her right leg was pulseless and cold and the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed.
Vascular surgery then did an exploration of the right groin and the patient then had pulses in her leg and it warmed up.
She was also noted to be slow to wake up and was able to follow commands, but on postop day #3 she became more confused and had apparent aphasia and abnormal mouth and tongue movements.
Neurology was consulted and felt she had transcortical motor aphasia and recommended an MRI.
She was also given Benadryl to counteract what they felt was motor difficulties with her tongue induced by Reglan.
She also had some left-sided weakness, but this eventually resolved as well.
She eventually could tolerate and MRI and it revealed ischemic left frontoparietal infarct.
She also had a low platelet count at one point and was found to be .................... positive.
Then on postoperative day #10 she became acutely short of breath in respiratory distress, requiring reintubation.
She also was bronched and had a mild tracheobronchitis.
She eventually was extubated on postop day #12 and she was more oriented and continued to progress and eventually neurology and renal signed off as her renal function improved and her mental status improved.
