TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired contiguous images through the abdomen and pelvis were obtained without intravenous contrast at 5-mm slice thickness.
FINDINGS: CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Small bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions are noted with adjacent areas of compressive atelectasis.
Small hiatal hernia is noted.
Evaluation of abdominal visceral organs is limited due to lack of intravenous contrast.
Trace amount of fluid is seen surrounding the liver.
There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Mild gallbladder wall edema is noted.
There are no calcified gallstones within its lumen.
A 2.3 x 1.1 cm hypodense splenic focus with peripheral areas of calcifications is noted (2:18), which may represent sequela of prior injury.
Pancreas appears unremarkable without ductal dilatation or peripancreatic fluid collection.
Right adrenal gland is normal.
Left adrenal gland appears prominent, without discrete nodule or lesions.
Imaged small and large bowel loops appear normal, without evidence of bowel obstruction.
There is no free air or free fluid within the abdomen.
There is no evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
Intra-abdominal aorta and its branches are notable for extensive calcified atherosclerotic disease without associated aneurysmal changes.
Mild ectasia of the SMA at its origin is noted.
CT OF THE PELVIS: Foley is in place with small amount of air locules within the bladder lumen, which is likely related to its placement.
The rectum and sigmoid colon appear unremarkable.
There is no free air within the pelvis.
A transplant kidney is present within the left lower pelvis and there is an unremarkable appearance without hydronephrosis.
There is no surrounding fluid collection.
Extensive arterial calcifications are seen without associated aneurysmal changes.
There are no pathologically enlarged pelvic oringuinal lymph nodes.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is seen.
No CT evidence of acute intra-abdominal process.
There is no evidence of intra-abdominal hemorrhage.
Transplant kidney appears is unremarkable appearance without hydronephrosis or surrounding fluid collection.
Small bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions with adjacent areas of compressive atelectasis.
Small hiatal hernia.
Extensive calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and its branches without associated aneurysmal changes.
Non-distended gallbladder with mild wall edema, which may be related to low albumin level and underlying liver disease.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 77761**] is a 40 year-old female with Type I diabetes mellitus (DMT1), end-stage renal disease (ESRD s/p LURT transplant [**12-15**]) with recent acute cellular rejection who presented for repeat renal transplant biopsy today admitted to the MICU from the ED for managment of hypotension, hypothermia, DKA, and persistent diarrhea.
ACTIVE ISSUES: #Hypotension: Felt likely to be hypovolemic shock given large volume diarrhea.
# Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)/Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis with respiratory compensation:  Anion gap of 16 reduced to 12 on insulin drip.
#Diarrhea: Her stool studies were negative for all bacterial pathogens so it is possible that this was virally mediated vs. medication-side effects from ciprofloxacin.
#Acute kidney graft injury: There was a mixed component of acute rejection with prerenal ATN (acute tubular necrosis) resulting from hypotension/hypovolemia as above.
# Anemia and leukopenia: She has these chronically, with baseline Hct around 30 and has had episodes of leukopenia in the past as well.
2. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
10. albuterol sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for SOB, wheezes.
16. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1) PO once a day as needed for constipation.
10. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain or fever.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Diarrhea secondary to viral gastroenteritis or medicine side effect   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were initially admitted to the hospital for high blood sugars because of diffuse diarrhea and dehydration.
