Admission Date:  [**2111-2-9**]              Discharge Date:   [**2111-2-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2049-3-2**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**] Chief Complaint: Dyspnea  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Hemodialysis  History of Present Illness: 61 yo with a history of ESRD on HD, multiple strokes (on coumadin for prophylaxis), and a history of VRE colonization and recent ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia as well as long-term minocycline used for suppression after MSSA infection in setting of vascular grafts, who presents with dyspnea at HD.
Several days later, he was noted to have a pelvic soft tissue abscess on [**12-18**].
He again developed fevers on [**2110-12-31**].
Patient was notably tachypneic to the 30s, audibly wheezing, with bilateral rales, requiring 4L nc.
CXR showed large L middle lobe pneumonia.
Patient was given Zosyn, and Levofloxacin for pneumonia coverage.
Patient became markedly tachypneic and was intubated in the ED.
Past Medical History: ESRD on HD h/o multiple prior CVAs - per daughter ambulates at home chronic hepatitis B HTN CAD Hyperlipidemia GERD s/p SBO [**2109**]  Social History: Lives with daughter, reports ambulatory at baseline Originally from [**Country **], has 2 daughters living in MA.
Physical Exam: Vitals: 98.3  157/81  79  20 97%RA General: Awake, alert, slow to answer questions but answers appropriately HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: Supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Crackles at the bases bilaterally CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: Midline abdominal scar with small umbilical hernia.
Soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly Ext: Warm, well-perfused, 1+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Has right-sided Hickman w/o erythema, AVF thrill palpable, no erythema.
Severe left perihilar consolidation has progressed either pneumonia or focal pulmonary hemorrhage.
Interstitial abnormality most readily seen in the right lung characterized by septal lines and peribronchial cuffing is probably edema, unchanged.
The heart is normal size and mediastinal veins are only mildly dilated.
Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC and a nasogastric tube in the upper stomach.
[**2111-2-11**] Chest Xray: Markedly increased opacification of the right hemithorax with rightward mediastinal shift indicating collapse/volume loss is due to a large mucous plug.
A small amount of the right upper lobe remains aerated.
Decreased asymmetric pulmonary edema results in improved aeration of the left lung.
The cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess due to the extensive right hemithorax opacification.
[**2111-2-13**] Video Swallow Study: Barium passed freely through the oropharynx and esophagus without evidence of obstruction.
There was aspiration with thin consistency.
No cough reflex was elicited.
Brief Hospital Course: 61 yo with a ESRD on HD, with recent prolonged hospitalization for incarcerated hernia, complicated by ESBL Klebsiella bacteremia recently on Vancomycin and Meropenem, who presents with dyspnea while at HD.
# Dyspnea: His initial CXR showed a clear large infiltrate thought to be a pneumonia and given his recent hospitalization, he was covered for hospital-acquired pneumonia with Vancomycin, Meropenem, and Levaquin.
His chest xray opacity resolved very quickly and the patient remained afebrile and his culture results all came back negative.
Ultimately, it was felt that he less likely had a bacterial pneumonia and more likely had some volume overload or possibly aspiration causing his initial dyspnea.
His antibiotics were discontinued and he remained without dyspnea.
He also underwent a video swallow and his diet was changed to ground solids and nectar thick liquids.
# Recent Klebsiella ESBL bacteremia: He was followed by ID on last hospitalization.
His antibiotics were ultimately stopped and he showed no symptoms of recurrence.
# ESRD on HD: He was continued on hemodialysis.
# CAD and Hypertension: He was continued on ASA, statin, BB, ACE.
# H/o multiple prior CVAs: His Coumadin was held upon admission due to concern for possible alveolar hemorrhage but was restarted during his hospitalization.
# H/o seizure disorder: Not documented, but patient on Keppra as an outpatient.
# Depression: Fluoxetine continued.

You were originally treated for pneumonia but your symptoms improved very rapidly and it was ultimately felt that you did not have a pneumonia.
Your antibiotics were stopped and you remained without shortness of breath.
You may have had extra fluid in your lungs which was removed during dialysis.
This can sometimes cause you to feel short of breath.
You should drink nectar thick liquids and eat ground solid food.
