Brief Hospital Course: This is a 71 year-old female with a history of COPD/ASthma, previous UTIs, C diff, and MSSA bacteremia as well as history of stroke and AKA initially admitted to MICU for sepsis from urine vs. pulmonary source now transferred to floor.
Urine culture grew out Ecoli - sensitive to cefipime.
A CXR also showed a RLL infiltrate possibly consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
Given her difficult access and the need for iv abx, a PICC line was placed.
She has known cholelithiasis and in the past has experienced elevated LFTs.
For this admission, fortunately, her LFTs were not significantly elevated and there was no RUQ tenderness.
Given Ms. [**Known lastname 66570**] history of CVA and appearance of infiltrates, aspiration was considered possible.
The nursing staff also noted several episodes of coughing/choking after eating.
the Swallow team was consulted and video swallow revealed that the patient is at risk for aspiration, but had NO frank aspiration.
