BNP was noted to be elevated at 1000, and there was some concern for dietary indiscretion during a recent trip.
Given leukocytosis, there was also concern for underlying respiratory infection, for which she was started on doxycycline.
However, on the day after admission, the patient had a syncopal event while in the bathroom, hitting her head on the door.
She endorseded lightheadedness prior to the event, denies any chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath.
Of note, imaging performed after the patient's head strike was significant for anterior C4 fracture of unclear chronicity.
Patient also experienced a significant head laceration, which was sutured prior to transfer.
She has been experiencing significant nausea and diarrhea; her doxycycline has been stopped out of concern that it could be contributing to her GI symptoms.
She denies any shortness of breath or chest pain.
She reports pain in the area where she struck her forehead.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.

# VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA / TORSADES DE POINTES - The event on telemetry strip from her outside hospital appears to be polymorphic ventricular tachycadia with a Torsades de Pointes morphology.
There was no clear inciting event noted.
She had no significant electrolyte abnormalities noted (K was 3.5 the morning of admission to the outside hospital and her magnesium was reassuring).
The most likely etiology at this point seems to be patient's underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy and prior scarring.
We consulted the Electrophysiology team and planned for ICD generator change early in the week.
# CORONARIES - The patient had no documented history of coronary disease in our records; or cardiac catheterizations.
On admission, she denied any chest pain and her EKG was without ischemic changes.
# DYSPNEA ON EXERTION - The patient has a known history of non-ischemic and ischemic cardiomyopathy with an LVEF of [**5-11**]%.
On presentation to the outside hospital, she was noted to have worsening dyspnea on exertion, an elevated BNP, and fluid overload on CXR.
On admission to the CCU, her exam still was notable for bibasilar crackles, a CXR showing mild fluid overload.
Of note, the patient also has history of asthma and was recently on a steroid taper; however, her exam did not reveal any wheezing or evidence of asthma exacerbation.
While she was started on Vancomycin and Cefepime empirically at the outside hospital, there did not appear to be any evidence of infection (afbrile and she was without leukocytosis).
# NAUSEA & DIARRHEA - An infectious process vs. medication effect from her Doxycycline is the most likely etiology.
If infectious, a viral process seems more likely than bacterial.
She was given IV anti-emetics and her loose stools and nausea steadily improved.
# C-SPINE FRACTURE ON C-SPINE IMAGING - The patient presented with a syncope episode that resulted in a presumed head injury and CT head with C-spine imaging showed evidence of a C4-fracture of unknown chronicity.
On exam in the CCU at [**Hospital1 18**], she had no evidence of neurologic compromise.
Ortho-Spine was consulted here and they reviewed the outside hospital imaging in our PACS system, noting that a likely osteophyte was probable and that the fracture was chronic.
# PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION - History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rate control with beta-blocker; we maintained her on Metoprolol and monitored her via telemtry with electrolyte optimization.
# RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME - We continued Ropinirole at her home dosing.
# DEPRESSION/ANXIETY - We continued Zoloft at her home dosing.
# CHRONIC BACK PAIN - We continued Oxycodone 2.5 mg by mouth in the evenings as needed, which was her home dosing.
