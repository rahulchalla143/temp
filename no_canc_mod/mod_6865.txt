TECHNIQUE: Contiguous 5-mm axial tomographic sections were obtained from the skull base through the vertex and viewed in brain and bone window.
Much of the study is significantly degraded by patient motion artifact and several sections were repeated.
Allowing for the motion-degradation, there has been no significant change in the bifrontal parenchymal hemorrhages, likely representing hemorrhagic contusions.
There is no interval increase in adjacent edema, mass effect or associated shift of the midline structures.
Assessment of the small hemorrhagic focus in the anterior aspect of the right middle cranial fossa is limited, but this, too, is not grossly changed, and no new hemorrhagic focus is identified.
Again demonstrated are large right occipital scalp subgaleal hematoma with underlying right basiocciput fracture and fluid layering in the right sphenoid sinus, with no definite sphenoid fracture seen.
IMPRESSION: Motion-limited study, with no significant change since the admission examination obtained on the preceding day.
No prior studies for comparison.
A C4 inferior endplate deformity most likely represents a Schmorl node, although inferior endplate fracture cannot be definitively excluded.
Moderately severe degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
Facet joint proliferative changes and posterior osteophytes result in mild spinal canal narrowing, most marked at C5/6.
There are emphysematous changes of the lungs with scarring of the right lung apex.
MRI is better in the evaluation of the thecal sac, but there are no gross thecal sac abnormalities.
A C4 inferior endplate deformity likely represents a Schmorl's node, although inferior endplate fracture cannot be definitively excluded.
Degenerative changes of the cervical spine.
Right basiocciput fracture well seen in coronal reformatted images; exits at the jugular foramen but spares the occipital condyle, and atlanto- occipital relationship is maintained.
Moderately severe degenerative changes, particularly at the C5/6 > C4/5, with moderate canal stenosis and slight indentation of the thecal sac (and cord).
Might be at risk for "central cord" injury at these levels (with appropriate mechanism).
b/l neural foraminal narrowing at these levels.
Evidence of severe bullous emphysema, w/irreg, focal pleuroparench thickening, R lung apex; a pleural-based mass is a consideration.
There are scattered mediastinal lymph nodes.
There is apical scarring.
A right upper lobe pulmonary nodule measures 4 mm.
There is bibasilar atelectasis.
Incidental note is made of a 1-cm spiculated right breast opacity concerning for malignancy.
Right kidney hydronephrosis and ureteral stent is seen.
A right kidney hypodensity likely represents a cyst, but cannot be further characterized on this examination.
There is a small gallstone.
Again seen is a suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 3.7 cm.
There are bilateral common iliac artery grafts with partial thrombosis.
No free fluid or free air within the mesentery.
There is sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
A 1.5 x 1.0 cm cystic structure is seen within the uterus.
There is a moderate amount of high- attenuation fluid within the pelvis, likely representing hematoma.
Partially displaced sacral fracture with adjacent presacral pelvic hematoma.
Suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 3.7 x 3.2 cm, decreased in size compared to the previous examination.
There are common iliac artery grafts with partial thrombosis.
Right-sided hydronephrosis with right ureteral stent.
Cystic density within the uterus, for which pelvic ultrasound is recommended.
Neurosurgery and Orthopedic surgery were consulted because of her injuries.
There were no cervical spine fractures identified and so her cervical collar was removed.
There was an incidental finding on her chest CT scan; a spiculated opacity right breast was noted and on exam there is a palpable mass.
Physical and Occupational therapy were consulted and have recommended short term rehab stay.
Hydromorphone 2 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for breakthrough pain.
