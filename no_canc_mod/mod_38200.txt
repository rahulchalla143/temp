There is diffuse interstitial and alveolar edema and engorgement of the [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] pedicle.
The cardiac silhouette is enlarged but stable accounting for patient and technical factors.
No definite large effusion is noted.
Limited evaluation of the left costophrenic angle due to the enlarged cardiac silhouette.
There is no pneumothorax.
Recommend repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis to assess for underlying infection  CT head [**2169-10-21**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
The distribution of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities, likely caused by pulmonary edema, is changed but its overall severity has not decreased.
ECHO [**2169-10-23**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and anterior wall, distal inferior wall and apex.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**2-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution).
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Aortic stenosis is no longer suggested.

# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Patient presents with symptoms consistent with heart failure exacerbation.
Likely [**3-15**] to progressive renal failure and increasing resistance to diuresis.
Cognizent of fluid intake restrictions.
All diuretics were stopped due to ineffectiveness.
# Hypoxia: On [**10-21**], patient developed increasing O2 requirement responsive to increased FiO2.
However, patient was not tachycardic with no significant LE edema or pain.
Aspiration pneumonia also possible, but patient afebrile, no leukocytosis.
TRALI was another consideration, but patient not tachycardic, no acute increase in O2 requirement within hours of pRBC transfusion.
Hypoxia improved with dialysis and improvement in fluid status.
# Altered mental status- Per patient's family, she has had progressively worsening intermittent solmnolence for past [**2-12**] weeks, being difficult to arouse from sleep for hours during the day on several occasions.
On [**10-21**] around noon time, patient developed worsening solmnolence.
Uremia was likely cause of altered mental status given progressive CKD, and history of intermittent solmnolence.
Anemia and heart failure could be contributing to solmnolence.
Has history of recent hemorrhoid bleed.
When blood bank attempted to type/screen blood, found to have new autoantibodies concerning for warm agglutinins.
No chest pain.
Chronically elevated troponins in the setting of CKD.
# CKD: elevated Cr.
Urgent dialysis started on [**10-21**] (see per above) for uremia and fluid overload.
H/o multiple UTI, E. coli resistent to [**Date Range **].
Culture and sensitivity showed E. coli only resistant to Ampicillin.
