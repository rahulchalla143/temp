The week prior she had had one minute episodes of a "dizzy" sensation while she was sitting and watching television and noted some heaviness in the left leg only.
Transport services [**Location (un) **] reported that the patient had had headache in the right temporal region, now resolved per the patient.
Daughter-in-law and son report very severe right facial droop and dysarthria that is very difficult to understand her.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting.
History of transient ischemic attack with speech slurring one year ago and hot flashes.
Depression after brain aneurysm.
Suspect gastrointestinal problems but she has not been scoped.
There are no liver, kidney, cancer history and no history of diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No alcohol and no drugs.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with history of myocardial infarction.
Father with myocardial infarction.
Neck - no bruits.
Extremities no edema bilaterally.
There is dysarthria although she follows commands and speech is fluent.
Ptosis in the right eye, torsional upbeating nystagmus in primary gaze.
Over the course of hospitalization, the nystagmus has improved significantly as well as the facial droop although she does continue to have somewhat of a facial droop.
She ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes twice.
Urine culture was growing Klebsiella oxytoca and Enterococcus species, both of which are pansensitive.
Sputum culture was no growth.
Initial magnetic resonance scan of the head showed bilateral pica infarcts, also an aneurysm clip causing loss of signal, inability to evaluate in distal right internal carotid artery M1 and A1 segments.
Angiogram on [**2148-5-23**], showed multiple areas of thrombosis including right vertebral artery thrombosis, left pica thrombosis, stenosis at the origin of the right anterior inferior cerebellar artery as well as stenosis of the left vertebral artery in both its proximal segment above the level of C5 vertebral body as well as the level of C1 vertebral body, approximately 50%, as well as distal intracranial left vertebral artery stenosis greater than 60% but with a patent basilar artery and collateral flow as described in the results.
There is hypoattenuation in the cerebellar cortex consistent with pica infarction bilaterally.
There is some surrounding edema, however, no midline shift or evidence of tonsillar herniation.
There was some distortion of the fourth ventricle and flattening of the quadrigeminal plate cistern which was unchanged as well as a hypodensity in the left basal ganglia consistent with an old infarct.
There was never any herniation or change in the CT.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis on [**2148-6-1**], showed no evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
This was obtained because of the patient's hematocrit, however, there was no retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
There was bilateral mild to moderate atelectasis in the lungs.
There was no free air and no lymphadenopathy.
There was a large left sided paraesophageal hernia.
This hernia required placement of nasogastric tube with the help of interventional radiology initially.
Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed ejection fraction of 40%, left and right atrium normal in size, left ventricular wall thickness normal with mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Left ventricular wall motion abnormalities show at the anterior apex akinetic, septal apex akinetic, lateral apex akinetic and the apex akinetic.
Aortic valve leaflets mildly thickened, no aortic regurgitation.
Mitral valve showed trivial mitral regurgitation seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted, initially transferred, and underwent angiogram revealing occluded right vertebral artery and stenosis in the left vertebral artery in addition to her pica infarcts bilaterally.
Transthoracic echocardiogram showed incidental clot in the heart although the infarcts were thought to be due to artery-artery emboli from the vertebrals.
Hypercoagulable workup was originally sent because initially the clot in the heart was found, though likely this clot formed because of the akinetic apex.
The hypercoagulable workup revealed elevated lipoprotein A.
The patient was started on Heparin on the day of admission especially given this clot in the heart and she was continued on Labetalol drip to control her blood pressure to keep it in the systolic range of 120 to 160.
The repeat head CT showed signs of cerebellar edema, but no herniation.
She did become somnolent around the date of [**2148-5-29**], however, she was found at that time to have a urinary tract infection and was started on Levaquin.
She had transient respiratory arrest and became very bradycardic.
Chest compressions were given for about one minute when the patient became asystolic and the patient was intubated.
She was intubated for the next couple of days for stabilization of her respiratory status and was extubated on [**2148-6-1**], and did well after that.
Her issues neurologically, the patient suffered bilateral pica strokes.
She is on Lipitor for future stroke prevention and also continues on Heparin drip until she has a therapeutic INR on her Coumadin.
As for the elevated lipoprotein A, that will be repeated and then Niacin will be started if it does indeed remain elevated.
It is unclear as to whether some of her somnolence may have been due to CO2 narcosis and so today she has been maintaining oxygen saturation in the low to mid 90s and has become more awake, is doing well on oxygen by nasal cannula.
Gastrointestinal - She has a large hiatal hernia and nasogastric tubes are very difficult to place.
She will receive a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube tomorrow [**2148-6-4**], as she cannot swallow, has failed her swallowing evaluation and likely will not be able to swallow for some time.
Infectious disease - She ahs remained afebrile throughout her hospital course.
She was found to have a urinary tract infection on [**2148-5-29**], and is now on day six of the Levaquin.
She has not had any retroperitoneal bleed and no guaiac positive stools.
Renally, she is stable and there are no issues.
Endocrine wise, she does have evidence of diabetes mellitus with a hemoglobin A1C of 6.0.
She has improved as far as having no further double vision, less vertigo and less dysarthria at this point than on admission.
