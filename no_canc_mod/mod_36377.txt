HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a pleasant 40 year old female with questionable suicidal history as reported by her boyfriend, who was found unconscious in her room surrounded by two empty cases of beer, empty bottle of vodka (one gallon) and questionable ingestion of multiple pills which were later identified to be Trazodone and phenothiazine.
The boyfriend also reported to the paramedics that the patient was admitted to a hospital recently for some psychiatry issue but it is unknown whether she left against medical advice or she was discharged from that hospital and it is also unknown to which hospital she was admitted.
She was also found to be very tachycardic, but there was no widening of QRS complexes.
Her Q-T intervals were prolonged, but her tachycardia was resolved with fluid hydration in the Emergency Department.
A chest x-ray was done which showed no underlying pulmonary disease, and a CT of the head was a limited study due to constant patient movement but no intracranial disease was identified.
After discussion with toxicology, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], it was decided that since the patient already received 50 grams of charcoal in the Emergency Department, it would be safe to extubate her and the patient probably did not have significant PCA toxicity as her QRS complexes were not widened.
