HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 72-year-old man with multiple medical problems including admission to the medical Intensive Care Unit in [**2149-11-8**] to [**2149-12-9**] for urosepsis complicated by myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and worsening renal failure resulting in initiation of dialysis.
During this admission the patient had a prolonged intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to his congestive heart failure.
He was sent to the Emergency Room on [**2150-1-12**] for evaluation where he was hypotensive to 70/48 and started on IV fluids and Dopamine.
An NG lavage was negative for bright red blood or coffee grounds.
Due to his hypotension and history of nosocomial infection, she was given Vancomycin and Ceftazidime and transferred to the medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.
He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post cardiac catheterization with LAD stent on [**2149-12-15**], status post myocardial infarction [**11-8**], congestive heart failure with an EF of 25-30%, type 2 diabetes times 20 years, peripheral vascular disease status post toe amputation times two, atrial fibrillation, pseudomonas urinary tract infection [**2149-11-8**], hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, now on hemodialysis Monday, Wednesday and Friday, gout, chronic lower extremity edema, obstructive sleep apnea on C-PAP, history of MRSA pneumonia, history of GI bleed with no EGD or colonoscopy report available.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general this is a lethargic but alert and elderly man in no acute distress.
The neck was supple with no jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular exam indicated regular rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.
He had a rectal bag in place with black, running stool.
On extremity exam the patient had 2+ peripheral pulses and no edema.
He does have a small ulcer on his left lateral shin with an eschar.
On his back he had a stage II sacral decubitus ulcer.
Chest x-ray indicated an elevated right hemidiaphragm, unchanged from previous study on [**12-29**].
There was no congestive heart failure or infiltrates.
Urinalysis indicated specific gravity of greater than 1.030, nitrites positive with 3-5 white blood cells and a few bacteria.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for management of a GI bleed.
The GI service saw the patient on hospital day #2 and felt that he was not actively bleeding since his blood pressure was stable and his blood counts were stable and it was therefore opted for upper and lower endoscopy when his coagulation parameters were optimized.
On the evening of hospital day #2 the patient had development of transient new first degree AV block.
Upper endoscopy indicated normal esophagus, stomach and duodenum with the exception of a small polyp in the stomach which was likely hyperplastic.
There was no active bleeding.
These findings were thought to be consistent with ischemic colitis.
As the patient was not actively bleeding and was status post myocardial infarction on last admission, he was restarted on 81 mg of Aspirin.
He was being screened for placement in an acute rehabilitation facility.
Ischemic bowel.
Congestive heart failure.
Coronary artery disease.
End stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Atrial fibrillation.
