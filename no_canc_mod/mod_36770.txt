Admission Date:  [**2172-7-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2172-7-17**]  Date of Birth:  [**2122-2-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 896**] Chief Complaint: CC:[**Hospital1 107175**] Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotrachial intubation  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 107176**] is a 50 year old woman with h/o prior traumatic brain injury, epileptic and nonepileptic seizures, recent concussion s/p fall ([**2172-6-30**]), who presents from a Code Blue in the Ophthalmology department for unresponsiveness.
The patient was in the ophthalmology clinic on [**2172-7-13**] when she fell out of her wheelchair and was found to be unresponsive and a Code Blue was called.
Ms. [**Known lastname 107176**] does not recall the events surrounging the episode but does recall she had constipation, poor PO intake, and nausea prior to the event.
The patient was presumed to be having a seizure and received a total of Ativan 4mg.
Imaging of her head and neck were normal.
She had purposeful movement in the ED and no obvious seizure activity by report.
The neurology team is unclear what caused her event, but do not think it was consistent with a seizure.
Past Medical History: - Hypothyroidism - TBI [**1-21**] assault resulting in ICH - Reported history of epilepsy.
Was admitted in [**11-26**] for further evaluation, and at that time EEG showed no interictal spikes, and pushbutton events did not show an EEG correlate.
It was felt that her events were mostly non-epileptic, and she was taken off Keppra at that time and bridged back to gabapentin - Almost blind [**1-21**] prior assault and subsequent macular degeneration - DJD with spondylosis and foraminal narrowing at C6-7 - S/p arthroscopy - HCV  Social History: She reports no cigarettes, etoh, or illicit durgs.
No murmurs or gallops.
No ankle edema.
No acute intracranial process.
Increased secretions within the nasopharynx are likely secondary to recent intubation.
Within these limitations, the major arteries of the head and neck are patent without focal flow-limiting stenosis or occlusion.
The left posterior inferior cerebellar artery is not visualized and may relate to a normal variant appearance.
There is no definite outline of the vessel noted to suggest thrombotic occlusion.
Mild degenerative changes in the cervical spine without significant canal stenosis; mild-to-moderate neural foraminal narrowing, inadequately assessed on the present study.
The presentation was most consistent with a syncopal episode, possibly related to her reported vomiting.
Neurology also followed by the patient and agreed that the presentation was more consistent with syncope.
Since recent trauma, patient has suffered from headaches and nausea.
Neurology followed and felt this could be consistent with a post-concussive syndrome.
Neck pain / Vertigo.
CTA shows no evidence of an acute arterial abnormality.
Neurology wondered if this might suggest a chronic vestibular disorder and recommended outpatient ENT follow-up.
Post-concussive syndrome 3.
Hypothyroidism  Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable  Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after passing out (syncope).
Your heart was evaluated and only showed mild mitral valve prolapse.
