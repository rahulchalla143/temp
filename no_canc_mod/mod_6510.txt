Admission Date:  [**2161-6-1**]       Discharge Date:  [**2161-6-12**]   Service:  ACOVE  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of Evans' syndrome and cryptogenic cirrhosis who was transferred to us from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital for further work up of fever and right upper quadrant pain.
His past medical history begins in [**2156**] in [**State 108**] when he experienced flu-like symptoms with fever, shaking chills and persistent nausea and vomiting.
While hospitalized there, he was found to be thrombocytopenic with a hemolytic anemia and was diagnosed with Evans' syndrome.
He was found to have negative direct and indirect Coombs test with a low haptoglobin and negative cold agglutinins.
SPEP showed polyclonal IGG and IGA increases, no monoclonal spikes.
There was no evidence for lymphoproliferative diseases at that time based on bone marrow results.
He had been admitted for loss of consciousness, fatigue and weakness.
He developed a large amount of ascites, had a questionable Dupuytren's contracture on the right hand and some mild palmar erythema.
Ultrasound showed large amounts of ascites with a left pleural effusion.
MRI showed normal liver, no mass in the pancreas or ductal dilatation.
Given all of the negative serologies, including [**Doctor First Name **], AMA and human immunodeficiency virus, the patient was given a diagnosis of cryptogenic cirrhosis.
On [**2161-5-19**], this patient presented to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital with weakness, hypotension and dehydration.
He had eaten a three pound lobster the night before and felt nauseous, diaphoretic and weak.
He had some dry heaves, but did not actually vomit, did not have any diarrhea and had a temperature to 102??????
The bone marrow biopsy from the outside hospital showed that it was normocellular with all lines present, had ill formed granulomas and mild lymphocytosis.
He had mild myeloid hyperplasia with unremarkable maturation.
There was a mild increase in megakaryocytes which were not dysplastic.
He had mild eosinophilia, plasmacytosis, approximately 3% mostly mature.
There was 1+ to 2+/4 on the iron stain with no increase in ringed sideroblasts.
I was consulted on [**5-23**], felt that the patient had a picture of obstructive liver disease and was started empirically on Unasyn for cholangitis.
At time of presentation, he was very lethargic, was not complaining of any pain and was afebrile.
He denied any recent nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
He had no abdominal pain.
Cryptogenic cirrhosis with a history of massive ascites 4.
Esophageal varices 5.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy 6.
He has a history of atrial fibrillation.
He has a history of pulmonary embolism status post IVC filter and he is status post splenectomy in [**2158-1-23**].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Sublingual icterus as well as scleral icterus bilaterally.
He had a dry oral mucosa.
EXTREMITIES:  Atrophic skin with multiple ecchymoses, no cyanosis or clubbing with 1+ lower extremity edema bilaterally.
On [**6-3**], the patient felt nauseous, had some dry heaves, became hypotensive and passed a large bowel movement consisting of melena and burgundy clots.
Endoscopy showed a grade 1 varix in the esophagus which was not bleeding at the time and the patient was transferred out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit, was re-scoped on the 12th again showing the same findings with the addition of a polypoid mass in the stomach which again was not bleeding.
He was transfused again with 1 unit and his blood pressure was monitored very carefully.
Endoscopy again on the 16th was performed due to increased encephalopathy.
Again, no bleeding was seen although blood was seen in the stomach and the polypoid lesion in the stomach was biopsied and sent for pathology.
Both the bone marrow and liver biopsies were consistent with granulomatous disease.
Other causes of granulomatous diseases were ruled out with the following serologies:  [**Doctor First Name **] was negative.
Hepatitis E antibody was nonreactive and hepatitis E antigen was nonreactive.
It was thought that the rise in white blood cell count was due to the chronic steroid treatment.
No platelet transfusions were ever necessary.
Given the granulomatous disease seen in these multiple organs without obvious pulmonary involvement and other things ruled out, sarcoidosis was entertained as a diagnosis.
With this information, a working diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis was entertained.
It was 2+ to 3+ periportal and intralobular inflammation noted consisting of lymphocytes and rare plasma cells, polymorphs and rare eosinophils.
Mild steatosis was noted.
Rare necrotic liver cells were present.
There was a focus of bile duct proliferation present, but no acute cholangitis was noted.
There was minimal stainable iron present in the hepatocytes.
There were no [**Doctor First Name **] hyaline or biostasis noted.
There was mild sinusoidal dilatation.
Towards the end of the hospital course, Infectious Diseases and Rheumatology were consulted to provide their input into the treatment of sarcoidosis by Rheumatology, as well as for Infectious Diseases to recommend other infectious causes of granulomatous hepatitis.
Rheumatology informed us that there was no good evidence that Cytoxan is beneficial on extrapulmonary sarcoidosis and recommended continuing with the prednisone therapy.
Infectious diseases recommended checking a number of other serologies, including brucellosis, Coxiella, RPR, human immunodeficiency virus and these are checked the day prior to admission.
NUTRITION:  The patient was NPO for a number of days while he was bleeding and undergoing multiple endoscopies.
At the end of the admission, the central line actually was pulled out and the patient began to take po's very well without complication.
ENDOCRINE:  The patient does not have a history of diabetes, but given the high dose steroids he is on, his glycemic control was difficult to manage.
The patient has no ascites this entire admission, therefore the aldactone was discontinued as well.
Ambien 5 mg po q hs prn insomnia 12.
Likely systemic sarcoidosis 2.
Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, status post splenectomy  DISPOSITION:  The patient is discharged to the [**Hospital1 20731**] Acute Care Facility.
