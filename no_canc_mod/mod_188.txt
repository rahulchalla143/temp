Chest x-ray revealed right lower lobe and left lower lobe infiltrates.
Other studies of note were a recent echocardiogram from [**2174-6-30**], which revealed an ejection fraction of 60%, 2+ mitral regurgitation noted, as was a small to moderately sized pericardial effusion, there were no echocardiographic signs of tamponade, there was no significant change from a prior echocardiogram of [**2174-6-27**].
