Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting utilizing left internal mammary to left anterior descending.
History of Present Illness: This is a 79 year old male who presented to outside hospital with worsening shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion and paroxsymal nocturnal dyspnea.
He denied chest pain at that time.
Echocardiogram showed 2+ mitral regurgitation with reduced LV ejection fraction and diastolic dysfunction.
He subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed severe three vessel disease.
Past Medical History: Coronary artery disease Diabetes Mellitus Type II Hypercholesterolemia Osteoarthritis Spinal Stenosis Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy Peripheral Neuropathy Claudication s/p Vocal Cord Surgery s/p Right Colectomy s/p Left Knee Replacement  Social History: Former smoker.
Physical Exam: Vitals: BP 145/80, HR 72, RR 18, SAT  94% on room air General: well appearing male in no acute distress HEENT: oropharynx benign, Neck: supple, no JVD, no carotid bruits Heart: regular rate, normal s1s2, no murmur or rub Lungs: clear bilaterally Abdomen: soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds Ext: warm, trace edema, no varicosities Pulses: 2+ distally Neuro: nonfocal   Pertinent Results: [**8-3**] Chest X-ray: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality [**8-4**] Carotid Ultrasound: No evidence of stenosis in either carotid artery.
[**8-4**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 30-40 percent).
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion  [**2129-8-3**] 11:01PM BLOOD WBC-11.9* RBC-3.59* Hgb-12.1* Hct-32.6* MCV-91 MCH-33.8* MCHC-37.2* RDW-12.9 Plt Ct-145* [**2129-8-6**] 09:35AM BLOOD WBC-13.2* RBC-2.73* Hgb-8.4* Hct-23.6* MCV-87 MCH-30.6 MCHC-35.4* RDW-15.1 Plt Ct-88* [**2129-8-3**] 11:01PM BLOOD PT-13.4* PTT-26.8 INR(PT)-1.2* [**2129-8-6**] 09:35AM BLOOD PT-17.5* PTT-85.8* INR(PT)-1.6* [**2129-8-6**] 05:05AM BLOOD Glucose-443* UreaN-26* Creat-1.5* Na-146* K-3.3 Cl-105 HCO3-18* AnGap-26* [**2129-8-6**] 08:02AM BLOOD ALT-228* AST-181* LD(LDH)-524* AlkPhos-44 Amylase-319* TotBili-0.9 [**2129-8-6**] 09:51AM BLOOD Type-ART pO2-65* pCO2-45 pH-7.25* calTCO2-21 Base XS--7  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 68068**] was admitted to the cardiac surgical service and underwent routine preoperative evaluation.
He remained pain free on medical therapy.
Workup was essentially unremarkable except for a positive urinalysis for which he was started on empiric antibiotics for potential urinary tract infection.
Given his coronary anatomy, it was agreed upon to performed a hybrid procedure of cornary artery bypass grafting, mitral valve replacement with concomitant percutaneous coronary intervention.
On [**8-5**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] performed single vessel coronary artery bypass grafting and a mitral valve replacement.
His operative course was notable for ventricular arrhythmias and hypotension.
Immediately following transfer to the CSRU, he experienced wide complex tahcycardia and hypotension which did not respond to pressors or defibrillation.
Amgiography revealed a widely patent LIMA to LAD and widely patent circumflex stents.
Despite multiple pressors and IABP support, he remained hypotensive and continued to experience ventricular arrhythmias.
