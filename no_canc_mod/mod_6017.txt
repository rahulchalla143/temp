He was found to have multiple rib fractures (right 6-9th) and fractures of transverse processes of right sided L1-3.
He was also noted to have a small left apical pneumothorax, liver lacerations, with a moderate perihepatic hematoma.
Creatinine was noted to be elevated (to as high as 5), and a temporary HD [**Last Name (un) **] was placed on [**2167-4-24**] (R IJ) for initiation of HD; prior to this, pt had been managed without dialysis.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for management of his diabetes.
Dermatology is also following for ?rash/blistering area on posterior cervical area.
TTE on admit showed moderately depressed EF with some anterior/inferior HK (anterior HK is new).
On the morning of [**4-24**], he was acutely SOB when returning from IR suite (where HD catheter had been placed).
He reported diaphoresis and right rib pain but denied any other sx.
He was seen by cardiology on [**4-24**] for ?SOB and EKG changes (anginal equivalent in the past had been chest and shoulder discomfort).
Cardiology recommended optimizing medical mgt with beta blockade, ASA, statin, plavix when hct stable (ddx NSTEMI vs. cardiac contusion from trauma).
Pt was transferred to MICU on [**4-24**] for management of his multiple medical issues and for SOB following transfusion of PRBC.
He continues to report right sided rib pain but denies new CP/jaw pain/shoulder pain.
He states that he was diaphoretic at time of SOB but denied n/v.

[**2167-4-21**] X-ray Knees - 1) No acute fracture is detected.
2) Probable small left knee joint effusion, with prominence of the prepatellar soft tissues.
The latter may relate to a small subcutaneous hematoma versus prominent prepatellar bursa.
[**2167-4-21**] Femur X-ray - 1) No acute fracture is detected.
2) Probable small left knee joint effusion, with prominence of the prepatellar soft tissues.
The latter may relate to a small subcutaneous hematoma versus prominent prepatellar bursa.
Extensive perihepatic hematoma surrounding the liver.
Evaluation for parenchymal disruption is not possible due to lack of IV contrast, and correlation to the prior outside CT with contrast should be made to [**Month/Day/Year 11197**] the degree of parenchymal disruption.
Small hemothorax.
Ground glass opacity dependently consistent with a combination of atelectasis and pulmonary contusion/hemorrhage.
Multiple rib fractures and transverse processes fractures on the right as described above.
Trace left apical pneumothorax, although better visualized on the prior cervical spine CT than on this study.
The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2167-4-29**] ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly to moderately depressed with inferior and infero-lateral akinesis including the infero-apex.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 59 yo man with hx of CAD s/p CABG in [**2161**], DM, htn, CRI with baseline scr in the 2's who was taken to [**Hospital1 5979**] Hosp [**4-21**] after he was involved in a MVA.
He sustained multiple right sided rib fractures and fractures of his L1-3 transverse processes.
He also sustained liver laceration with associated hematoma.
He also had a small left apical pneumothorax.
SOB: On [**4-24**] the pt became acutely SOB when returning from IR suite where he had a HD catheter place.
This was thought likely [**1-1**] to volume overload as he had worsening renal failure.
CXR showed changes c/w failure (new from prior CXR).
EKG at that time demonstrated TWI/ST depressions in an anterolateral distribution, but this was unchaged from his admit EKG.
He reported diaphoresis and right rib pain but denied any other sx.
There was also the possibility of ischemia at that time.
His cardiac enzymes at that time were negative and cardiology recommended optimizing medical mgt with beta blockade, ASA, statin, plavix when hct stable (ddx NSTEMI vs. cardiac contusion from trauma).
CRI: Pt has CRI likely [**1-1**] to HTN and diabetes.
He ended up needing 2 sessions of dilaysis for fluid overload after which his creatinine trended back to baseline.
CAD: s/p CABG in [**2161**]; His SOB was most likely [**1-1**] to volume overload but could also have been [**1-1**] to CAD and ACS.
He had anterolateral ST depressions/TWI on his EKG at admission and a ?new anterior hypokinesis on echo.
The felt that the differential diagnosis included NSTEMI vs. Cardiac contusion from trauma, but that if it was an NSTEMI it was not acute.
DM: Pt has type one DM and was on insulin pump at home.
He has an insulin pump at home, but this was not working properly, so he was given standing insulin and a humalog SS on the floor and followed by [**Last Name (un) **].
He was not well regulated with lantus/humalog and he was switched to U500 standing dose with humalog and his sugars became better controlled.
48 hours later his CK was noted to have tripled and he developed a transaminitis.
Derm was consulted and thought it was likely [**1-1**] to volume overload.
He developed a liver laceration during the accident.
MVA:  The patient developed a liver laceration and rib fractures after the MVA.
HIs liver laceration was managed as above.
His pain was controlled with RTC tylenol and oxycodone.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for pain for 10 days.
Disp:*1 bottle* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: All Care VNA of Greater [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on Chronic Renal Failure Diabetes Mellitus Rib Fractures Cardiac Contusion with troponin leak   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Tolerating PO intake and oral pain meds.
Discharge Instructions: --We have increased your lopressor to 50mg three times a day.
