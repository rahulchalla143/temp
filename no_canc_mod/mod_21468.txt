Admission Date:  [**2120-5-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2120-5-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2043-7-14**]       Sex:  F  Service:  Cardiac Care Unit  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76 year-old female with hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presents with acute inferoposterior myocardial infarction.
The patient reports she has had stuttering chest pain for the past two weeks but was constant since 8 P.M. on the day of admission.
The patient reports that the pain was in her left arm and was associated with diaphoresis.
The patient went to [**Hospital3 418**] Emergency Room where an EKG showed 2 to [**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevations in 2, 3 and F and posterior ST elevations.
Patient was pain free on transfer.
Cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital3 **] revealed single vessel disease.
The ST elevations persisted but the patient remained pain-free.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denied dyspnea on exertion, denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea.
She had reported chest pain as previously described.
Patient also reported any syncopal or presyncopal episodes.
Patient reported past medical history of hypercholesterolemia and hypertension but no other known coronary artery disease.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Total abdominal hysterectomy.
3) Mastoid surgery.
No known drug allergies.
She was a well appearing female in no acute distress.
Her cardiac examination was regular rhythm with no murmurs.
There was an S4 but no rubs.
There was no lower extremity edema and her pulses were intact bilaterally.
An EKG on presentation was normal sinus rhythm at 92, ST elevations in 2, 3 and F with elevations in 3 greater than 2.
She had ST depressions in 1, L and V1 through V4.
Post cardiac catheterization she had persistent ST elevations.
Chest x-ray at the outside hospital revealed a calcified aorta, no evidence of congestive heart failure.
It did show a hiatal hernia.
Cardiac, coronary artery disease:  The patient had an inferoposterior myocardial infarction with ST elevations.
The patient had persistent ST elevations post cardiac catheterization.
However, she had a rising creatinine at the time during the hospitalization and therefore the ACE inhibitor was held at the time of discharge.
Patient had no residual lesions, no LAD or left circumflex lesions and the patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] for her cardiology care.
Blood pressure:  The patient was very hypertensive on admission.
Femoral ultrasound revealed a small common femoral AV fistula on the right.
Anemia:  The patient has a baseline anemia with a hematocrit on admission of 31.
Her iron studies reveal anemia of chronic disease.
She had no evidence for active bleeding.
Chronic renal insufficiency:  The patient had an elevated creatinine to 1.5 on the day of discharge.
This was likely due to a component of dehydration as well as post cardiac catheterization after receiving [**Male First Name (un) **].
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: ST elevation myocardial infarction.
FOLLOW UP PLANS:  Patient will follow up with her primary care physician in the week following discharge for further monitoring of her hematocrit as well as her renal function.
