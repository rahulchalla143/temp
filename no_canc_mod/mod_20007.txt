She was in her USOH until yesterday afternoon when she felt acute onset left flank pain with subjective fevers and nausea.
She presented to the ED today with worsening symptoms at the urging of her fiance who felt she appeared "blue and pale."
A UA showed evidence of UTI, and periureteter stranding was confirmed on pelvis CT.

In particular, the combination of stones, distension and wall thickening with edema could be seen with cholecystitis, but clinical correlation is needed since the appearance is not specific and the given history is of left flank pain.
A hepatobiliary scan may be helpful if there is concern for choleystitis and possibly serial ultrasound scanning.
The lack of stones makes recent passage of a stone less likely.
Distended gallbladder with trace amount of pericholecystic fluid in the setting of periportal edema and [**Doctor First Name 9189**] mesentery with mild soft tissue anasarca; part of these changes could reflect third spacing; however, if clinical concern for acute cholecystitis, an ultrasound should be considered.
Nonobstructed ventral hernia containing loops of transverse colon.
Left adnexal cystic structure, which may represent hydrosalpinx.
Brief Hospital Course: 43 year-old woman with a history of hypertension, obesity s/p gastric bypass [**2170**] and chronic nutritional anemia [**1-20**] bypass surgery presenting with pyelonephritis and urosepsis.
# Urosepsis/Pyelonephritis: Initially met SIRS criteria with bandemia, tachycardia, and left ureteral fat stranding and UA with evidence of infection.
Received 7L of NS in ED without improvement.
# Acute renal failure: Resolved.
Prerenal in setting of sepsis and hypotension.
# Microcytic anemia: Hct 23.5 vs baseline ~30.
# Headache: similar to baseline headaches, frontal headache no visual changes no nausea.
# gallbladder edema: initially concerning for cholecystitis but unlikely given normal LFTs and absence of LUQ pain.
You were admitted for urosepsis and pyelonephritis.
