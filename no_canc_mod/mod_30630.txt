UGI bld, + MRSA and Pseudomonas in sputum during recent admission at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] who presented to the ED from rehab for suspected COPD exacerbation.
Pt was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for complaints of wheezing and worsening dyspnea.
His dyspnea was attributed to COPD exacerbation likely [**3-4**] tracehobronchitis.
Since his discharge on [**2-11**], the patient had been reporting increasing tightness in his chest and shortness of breath.
His wife notes that he had not slept for at least 48 hours due to his persistent respiratory discomfort.
Additionally, he had been eating minimally, and had begun to develop increased lower extremity, worse than ever in the past.
Of note, lasix had been discontinued during his most recent admission due to hyponatremia to 133 and hypovolemia.
However, the patient's wife believes it was restarted yesterday due to his progressive lower extremity edema and decreased urine output.
He had been having hallucinations and talking to people who were not in the room.
He was noted to have increased work of breathing.
Initially this was thought to be related to a CHF exacerbation so nitropaste was placed on the patient without improvement.
CTA was done which showed no PE and a possible recent aspiration on prelim read.
He was observed having myoclonic jerking during his CTA scan, and neurology was curbsided to ensure that this was not seizure activity due to his hyponatremia.
He also rec'd 1/2 L of NS for his hyponatremia prior to transfer.
Imaging: CXR: no evidence of infiltrate .

Brief Hospital Course: 66 year-old male with severe COPD and recent admission for COPD exacerbation who was admitted intubated after experiencing increased WOB and hyponatremia.
Pt has a history of dyspnea that improves only with an increase in his steroid doses.
His last spirometry in [**2114-12-26**] showed Stage IV COPD with an FEV1 28%; FEV1/FVC 55%.
He did not improve with diuresis, nitro page or nitro gtt, so this did not likely represent a CHF exacerbation.
Had recent admission for COPD exacerbation and was treated with 10 days of ceftaz and 5 days of Bactrim for pseudomonas/MRSA + sputum.
Patient presumed to have COPD exacerbation wasn was treated with iv solumedrol and transitioned to po prednisone.
Patient did not appear to have much of a cough or sputum production prior to intubation.
However, he does have evidence of infiltrate on CT scan, ?
# Hyponatremia: Unclear what precipitated such as drop, likley [**3-4**] to significnat home lasix dose (60mg [**Hospital1 **])  Had been slightly hyponatremic during his admission at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] and lasix had been discontinued.
Also given his chronic steroid use, there is a question of possible adrenal insufficiency (elevated potassium/hyponatremia) though chronic steroid use does not cause primary adrenal insufficiency so mineralocorticoid axis should be intact.
His Na began correcting after he was given IVF and his hypovolemia was fully corrected once he was extubated and was able to control his po intake.
# Delirium: Resolved.
However, he had also been taking increased narcotic medication, had minimal sleep over multiple days and had not been eating or drinking.
He has diasolic heart failure, but no pnd/orthopnea or other symptoms suggestive of acute CHF.
There may also be a contribution from his recent steroid use.
His lasix was held as above due to hyponatermia.
# Hypertension: his BP regimen was continued with slight changes to his doses of verapamil and amlodipine while in-house.
## rash on buttock: The patient had a vesicular-appearing rash on his left buttock.
Although the rash had a somewhat vesicular appearance (but no open or draining vesicles), it would not be expected to heal with topical steroids if it were herpes, so this diagnosis is in question.
His dermatologist's office was [**Name (NI) 653**], but there was no clear reference in the records by review of a nurse to indicate herpes; he has had an irritant dermatitis treated with topical steroids including clobetasol.
DuoNeb 0.5-2.5 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization [**Hospital1 **]: One (1) neb Inhalation every four (4) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
If you have worsening shortness of breath, fevers, chills, chest pain, lightheadedness or episodes of loss of consciousness, call your doctor or seek medical attention immediately.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14827**] office will call you with an appointment.
