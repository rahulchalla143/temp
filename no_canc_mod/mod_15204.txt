HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74 year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who presented to [**Hospital3 9683**] on [**2115-2-22**] with one day of chills, diaphoresis after walking progressing to nausea and vomiting and then a band like lower abdominal pain.
At that time he denies chest pressure, shortness of breath, diarrhea, cough, bright red blood per rectum, flank pain or urinary difficulties.
He was admitted to the floor for presumed urinary tract infection and then became hypotensive to a systolic in the 80s responsive to fluid boluses.
There was concern for ascending cholangitis and he was started on Ampicillin and Gentamycin and then Timentin and transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for an ultrasound and possible endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
On arrival the patient complained of mild upper chest pain for approximately ten minutes and had an electrocardiogram without evidence of change.
Renal stones status post lithotripsy and ureteral stent on [**5-25**].
Coronary disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2111**].
No angina afterward status post angioplasty.
Rheumatoid arthritis.
Aortic stenosis.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
General, elderly and in no acute distress.
No evidence of jugulovenous distention.
[**3-1**] crescendo decrescendo systolic murmur at the right base.
[**3-1**] holosystolic murmur at the apex.
Abdomen mild tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant.
No rebound or guarding.
Skin no evidence of jaundice.
Chest x-ray no abnormalities.
KUB dilated bowel loops.
No evidence of obstruction.
Electrocardiogram sinus bradycardia at 58 beats per minute, normal axis, normal intervals, no ST T wave changes.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed demonstrating no son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign, no cholelithiasis or cholecystitis, dilated common bile duct without evaluation of the distal common bile duct secondary to overlying bowel gas, hypoechoic right lobe of the liver.
CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated no free air in the abdomen, no obstruction, evidence of diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
Small focus of air in the gallbladder with possible stone in the distal common bile duct with a prominent proximal common bile duct.
MRCP on [**2-23**] demonstrated acute cholecystitis with stones in the distal common bile duct causing dilatation of the common bile duct.
A blood culture obtained from the date of admission on [**2115-2-23**] did, whoever, grow out Klebsiella pneumoniae in one out of four bottles that was pan sensitive.
The pain was controlled with Tylenol and Percocet.
On [**2115-2-26**] the patient was transferred to the Medical Floor given that he was no longer showing signs of septic physiology and the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis was confirmed and was clearly the cause of the patient's symptoms and abnormalities.
Coronary artery disease.
Hypotension with questionable sepsis physiology.
RECOMMENDED FOLLOW UP:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2819**] [**Hospital Unit Name 52518**], [**Location (un) 86**], [**Numeric Identifier 52519**], phone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2359**] for elective cholecystectomy.
He was informed to let his doctor know of any fevers or abdominal pain and to avoid aspirins or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs until one week following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
