Admission Date:  [**2117-1-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2117-1-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2072-1-20**]             Sex:   M  Service: [**Year (4 digits) 662**]  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 562**] Chief Complaint: DOE/AMS  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: PD BAL Intubation CVVHD Central Line placement   History of Present Illness: 44 yo male with history of HIV (CD4 202, VL 27,200 in [**5-3**]), ESRD [**12-31**] HIV nephropathy, CHF (EF 25%) who presents with dyspnea on exertion.
Pt was very lethargic when I interviewed him due to recent ativan dose.
States he has been having shortness of breath on and off for the last week.
States he has had recent fevers.
Positive non-bloody diarrhea for several days.
Was arrousable only to pain by the time MICU resident evaluated him - he had been given 4 mg ativan IV as he was confused, agitated, hypertensive and tachycardic in the ED - this concerning for ETOH W/D.
Past Medical History: - HIV >10 yrs [**5-3**] CD4 202, VL 27,200 - End-stage renal disease secondary to HIV nephropathy- on PD - CHF EF 25% - Anemia on Aranesp.
- Hyperparathyroidism.
- Hyperphosphatemia.
- Sickle cell trait.
- Polysubstance abuse.
Social History: -Crack cocaine use, see HPI -h/o EtOH abuse - see hpi -smokes ~1 PPD -lives in own apt in public housing  Family History: Significant for ethanol abuse in the mother as well as diabetes  and multiple myeloma.
Physical Exam: MICU admit PE T 99.1 BP 161/131 HR 130 RR 16 O2sats 96% on RA Gen: Very lethargic, falling asleep throughout exam and not complying with my requests, periodically apneic with snoring (OSA) HEENT: PERRL, mmm, anicteric Neck: unable to assess JVD as patient would not sit up Lungs: CTAB but very poor effort Heart: RRR no m/r/g Abd: Distended but soft, + fluid wave, NT, hypoactive bowel sounds Ext: no edema Neuro: To lethargic to due exam, no asterixis  Pertinent Results: ECG [**2117-1-16**]- Sinus tachycardia, LAD, LVH nl intervals, no ST/T wave changes .
Mild pulmonary edema.
CXR [**2117-1-16**]- Probable mild asymmetric pulmonary edema, given the prior appearance of the same on earlier radiograph.
Stress Test [**9-2**]- Nonspecific T wave changes in the absence of anginal symptoms.
Enlarged left ventricle with global hypokinesis.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal with severe global.
Systolic function of apical segments is relatively preserved suggestive of a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Given the normal ascending aortic and left atrial size, the absence of a history of systemic hypertension, the prominent symmetric hypertrophy suggests an infiltrative process (e.g., amyloid).
Brief Hospital Course: 44 yo M with history of HIV, ESRD, CHF initially presented with worsening DOE and altered mentation after ativan, 4 mg IV given for agitation in ED and ?
ETOH W/D, in setting of recent crack cocaine use.
# AMS - - Initially, it was felt that this was likely due to ativan given for agitation.
An ABG on admission to the MICU revealed that the patient was in hypoxic respiratory failure.
In addition, the differential on admission included: - head bleed: Head CT negative for bleed or mass lesions - delirium tremens: he was monitored for evidence of worsening tachycardia/tremulousness,hypertension and placed on a CIWA scale.
- Infection - [**Year (4 digits) **] cx and peritoneal diasylated cultures were negative.
[**2117-1-20**]: Extubated, initially sedated because of administration of haldol - by [**1-22**], patient more alert and answering questions.
# DOE - our intial diagnoses included CHF(known EF of 25%), PE, volume overload due to failure to due PD, ACS, PNA (community acquired vs atypical vs PCP).
Also could be secondary to crack cocaine use leading to myocardial ischemia and worsening CHF.
- [**1-17**] : intubated for hypoxia along with general restlessness of patient which made dialysis and other management very difficult -> he was found to have picture of acute pulmonary edema.
From time of intubation ([**1-16**]) to day of extubation, patient oxygenated and ventilated well.
No significant events noted.
No significant EKG changes.
# CHF - - patient with known EF of ~ 25% from old ECHO.
No history of CAD and normal perfusion stress test in [**9-2**], however patient at risk for accelerrated development of CAD due to HIV and HAART regimen(if he is taking), tobacco use and crack cocaine use.
- patient received PD per renal service while in MICU with negative fluid balance - electrolytes were corrected as necessary - started on Epogen for anemia and Fe for iron deficiency anemia.
# [**Name (NI) **] Unclear if he has been taking HAART regimen and Bactrim.
# Anemia- Baseline varies from 29-35.
No signs of active bleeding.
# Sinus tachycardia- Multiple causes possible including cocaine use, ETOH use, withdrawals, fever, hypovolemia.
# HTN- Likely secondary to non-med compliance, ETOH and cocaine use.
- initial HTN on admission was due likely to fluid overload and cocaine use.
- stool cultures, cdiff, O&P  all negative - had some diarrheal BM on discharge .
# Code- FULL .
# Communication: Partner.
