ESCHERICHIA COLI.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
There is interval increase in interstitial markings and septal lines consistent with worsening pulmonary edema.
Chest CT is recommended for further evaluation to exclude a mass in this region.
CT abdomen [**6-1**]:  IMPRESSION: 1) Foci of decreased enhancement in both kidneys consistent with pyelonephritis.
2) Left renal cyst and additional low attenuation focus, which may represent a cyst but is too small to be fully characterized.
3) Bibasilar scarring and atelectasis.
No pneumothorax or any other chest abnormalities in comparison with the previous study.
[**6-2**] US: The gallbladder is normal, and there is no evidence of stones.
The liver is of normal echogenicity and echo texture without focal lesions.
There is no intrahepatic bile duct dilatation.
There is no evidence of free fluid in the abdomen.
Brief Hospital Course: 64 year old female with history of atrial fibrillation s/p recent hospitalization for ablation, discharged on [**5-18**], who returns with fatigue x 3 days, and fever to 102 with chills, found to have UTI by UA and evidence of pyelonephritis on CT scan, hypotension on admission responsive to 4 L IVF, thought to be urosepsis.
Patient remained afebrile for the last 2 days of her admission.
2) Hypotension:  Presumed secondary to urosepsis.
Hypotension resolved s/p 4 L IVF.
Also, patient got 2 U PRBC which also helped volume status.
3) Anemia:  Patient with large hct drop with rehydration, unmasking anemia (was dehydrated on presentation).
Given recent groin instrumentation during a-flutter ablation, could have had significant bleeding into groin - has large ecchymosis in R groin.
Hemolysis labs negative.
Anemia should be followed as outpatient.
4) Atrial fibrillation:  s/p ablation.
6) LFTs: LFTs noted to be elevated on [**6-2**], however patient had no abdominal pain or tenderness.
Likely this is a result of hypotension on the liver during her initial presentation and would be expected to improve.
