IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema and bilateral small pleural effusion are unchanged.
Brief Hospital Course: 88 yo F with hx of esophageal dysmotility (secondary to radiation therapy to neck indicated for thyroid cancer) who is s/p aspiration event on evening on admission.
She has also not had any swallowing rehab or therapy since her radiation treatment in [**2182**].
She had tried numerous outpatient therapies, including peppermint but without success.
Speech and swallow evaluated her on hospital day 3, however due to her acute change in mental status was unable to perform a swallow evaluation.
Multiple family meetings were performed with the son concerning possible solutions, which include allowing continued aspiration or possible G/J-tube placement.
Pt was reevaluated by speech and swallow therapy after her ICU stay and had severe evidence of aspiration.
Pt was made strict NPO as it was not safe for her to continue eating at that time.
Pt has intact cognition, has capacity, and clearly expressed her wishes to return to eating regardless of the consequences as well as to return home if possible.
Pt and son were given information by the speech and swallow therapists regarding eating techniques that may lessen risk of aspiration.
However, pt is allowed to eat whatever she desires as the goal of eating is for pleasure and comfort.
If a significant choking/aspiration episode were to occur, the goals of care are again comfort oriented and pt should be given IV morphine or IV ativan prn choking or dyspnea according to her wishes.
## Hypoxia, secondary to aspiration pneumonia and pneumonitis- The patient was acutely hypoxic and required a non-rebreather initially on coming from the emergency room.
There was also a marked leukocytosis and left shift, and therefore the patient was placed on IV levofloxacin for pneumonia and completed a 7 day course.
However, symptoms were most likely related to aspiration pneumonitis.
## Stridor: On hospital day 3 the patient developed acute stridor and respiratory distress, with evidence of retraction and accessory muscle use.
ENT was urgently consulted and performed laryngoscopy, which showed bilateral vocal cord paralysis.
Outside hospital records from [**Hospital1 756**] were obtained which showed that the patient had long standing left sided paralysis and vocal cord stripping, but there was no evidence of right sided paralysis.
The patient's blood gas initially showed hypoxia and hypercarbia, and an a-line was placed for close monitoring of gas exchange.
## Delirium: On hospital day 2 the patient became acutely delirious in the setting of a blood glucose level of 39.
##anemia-Studies show anemia of chronic disease.
