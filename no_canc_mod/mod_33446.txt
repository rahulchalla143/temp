Known acute right hemipontine infarction is not well-visualized on the CT.
At least 75% diameter stenosis of the proximal portion of the right internal carotid artery, just distal to the bifurcation; this could be characterized further by focused son[**Name (NI) 867**].
Left frontal encephalomalacia, most likely related to old infarct.
Acute infarction of much of the right hemipons, likely on the basis of pontine perforating vessel occlusion.
Old left frontal and chronic microvascular infarction, with significant central atrophy.
CT Head [**1-12**] IMPRESSION: Evolution of right pontine infarction.
No intracranial hemorrhage.
No PE or aortic dissection although evaluation for subsegmental PE is limited due to motion.
Significant left lower lobe collapse, bilateral effusions.
Hypoattenuating collection in the bladder likely related to hematoma.
Abd X-ray [**1-19**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of contrast extravasation or free air.
No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is bibasilar atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 83 yom with recent right pontine stroke who was initially in the Neuro ICU who was transferred for aspiration.
Now s/p PEG placement course complicated by aspiration pneumonia, now with new foley trauma, acute renal failure, and peg misplacement leading to respiratory distress and relative hypotension now extubated and clinically improving.
# Right Hemi-Pontine Infarction:  83 year-old man presented to OSH with abrupt onset L sided weakness and dysarthria, given tPA and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**], where he was found to have a large R pontine CVA.
In the ED he had a persistent dense L hemiplegia as well as significant dysarthria.
Repeat imaging showed no bleeding or vessel obstruction, therefore no arterial interventions were available.
He did not pass a speech and swallow evaluation and continued to have slurred speech.
His course was complicated by aspiration pneumonia, hematuria secondary to foley trauma.
The patient remains a high aspiration risk given his stroke.
# Aspiration Pneumonia/respiratory failure:  After large R pontine CVA patient had persistent dense L hemiplegia as well as significant dysarthria.
He did not pass a speech and swallow evaluation and continued to have slurred speech.
On morning of [**1-15**] he developed hypoxia with saturation of 79% on room air.
CXR initially c/w pneumonitis that cleared, however then developed new infiltrate c/w asp pna.
The patient susequently grew MRSA from his sputum and was continued on Vancomycin for a 10 day course.
He weaned to 1 L NC with resp alkalosis and intermittent tachypnea with central etiology.
His CXR from [**1-22**] showed small-to-moderate left-sided effusion.
There is bibasilar atelectasis.
The patient continues to be a high risk for aspiration given his stroke.
It was incidentally found to traverse through transverse colon and then to enter the stomach on CT obtained to eval pelvis for hematuria on [**1-19**].
There was no evidence of extravasation of contrast on xray or CT.
Given the patient had recurrent fevers and PEG placement the pt was started on cipro/flagyl for course planned to end on [**1-25**].
# Persistent Fevers: Sputum persistenly growing MRSA, on Vancomycin, however fevers also occurred in setting of significant acute gouty flare, improving on colchicine.
Fever trending down.
Hematuria:  Patient developed hematuria with clots and urology consulted on [**1-19**].
He was found to have hematoma in bladder from foley trauma and a cystocopy revealed prostatic trauma.
If the patient continues to have hematuria he can be restarted on CBI.
# Coffee Grounds from OG tube: The patient was noted to have one episode of coffee ground from his OG tube.
This is likely secondary to stress ulceration.
He as not had any subsequent episodes and his Hct has remained stable.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital 5503**] Rehab Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Right pontine stroke with left hemiparesis Respiratory failure Aspiration pneumonia Traumatic hematuria Anemia .
Secondary: Hypertension Gout OA BPH   Discharge Condition: stable, tachypneic with RR 30-40, normotensive, left sided weakness and dysarthria   Discharge Instructions: It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were in the hospital.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] because of a large stroke.
Your course was complicated by an aspiration pneumonia that you received antibiotics for.
You also had bleeding from your bladder after a catheter was placed.
A X-ray and CT scan showed that there was no leakage.
