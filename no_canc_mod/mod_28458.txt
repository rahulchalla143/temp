Pt had EGD that showed bleeding varices, 1 was banded.
CXR:  Enlarged cardiac silhouette and slight widened mediastinum which could represent pericardial effusion and/or mediastinal hematoma, however AP projection makes for difficult comparison and enlargement could be attributed to projectional differences.
Bilateral hazy opacifications within the parenchyma which could represent pulmonary edema.
Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions.
There is no pericardial effusion.
He was covered with broad spectrum antibiotics and given Hydrocort for possible adrenal insufficiency as well.
Culture results from the outside hospital were obtained, c/w high grade bacteremia.
Given that he had an enlarged heart on CXR a bedside echo was initially done to rule out effusion, tamponade.
Given his elevated creatinine and severe volume overload in addition to hyperkalemia, renal service was consulted, and CVVH was initiated.
As the patient continued to be unresponsive >24 hours after coding, it was thought that he likely had a very poor neurological prognosis.
