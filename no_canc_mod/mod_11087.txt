Severe posterior circulation insufficiency.
This is an 83 year old right handed man without any significant past medical history as he did not present himself to medical attention, had initially presented with right hemiplegia and dysarthria and had been found to have a left parapontine ischemic stroke in the setting of severely compromised posterior circulation including bilateral vertebral stenoses and midbasilar stenosis.
Reportedly his blood pressure which usually was systolic of 160 to 200 dropped to 130 and he had worsening symptoms of right hemiplegia and also in terms of left sided symptoms.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Neurological examination on readmission revealed the patient is dysarthric and somnolent but fairly arousible, can say his name but does not know the date (question inattentive/frustrated) or what hospital.
The rest of the examination was not completed due to the patient's disinterest.
Right facial droop.
There was also question of patient's interest and effort during this part of the examination.
Sensory - The patient denies any decrease in sensation to light touch and cold touch, question of inattention.
He had 1+ patellar reflexes bilaterally.
Neurologic - A magnetic resonance scan was done with stroke protocol that showed extension of restricted diffusion in the left parapontine region with new restricted diffusion in the left cerebellum and a minimal restricted diffusion on the right.
In summary, head of bed was kept flat and when we would either try to increase the inclination of the head of the bed, he would get symptoms including nausea and loss of strength on the left.
After an episode of pulmonary edema on the morning of [**2109-2-5**], after administration of fresh frozen plasma to reverse supratherapeutic INR that will be described below in the cardiovascular section, an angiogram was done by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 37461**] to determine possibility of angioplasty of posterior circulation, however, on this angiogram, there was evidence of total occlusion of the basilar artery with evidence of collaterals being formed from the PICA and possible collateral blood flow from the left meningeal vasculature.
Given this situation, there was no indication for any further intervention and no angioplasty was done.
From a neurological point of view, we are going to manage him conservatively with gentle challenge of his posterior circulation by increasing the inclination of his bed and hoping he does not get any symptoms.
However, on [**2109-2-5**], he was found to be diaphoretic, tachypneic with rate of 40s and stat electrocardiogram was done that showed evidence of ST wave elevation and reciprocal depression in the precordial leads and with evidence of T wave inversion in the lateral leads.
A stat cardiology consultation was called and this was felt to be flash pulmonary edema due to the fact that he had recently been transfused with one unit of fresh frozen plasma for an supratherapeutic INR of 5.2.
The patient had another congestive heart failure exacerbation with flash pulmonary edema on chest x-ray on the morning of [**2109-2-17**].
He was again found to be diaphoretic with tachypnea in the 40s and systolic blood pressure 220/110.
We had a long discussion with the cardiology team and they felt that the patient was going to continue having subendocardial ischemia that would cause flash pulmonary edema and similar episodes to the one he had on [**2109-2-5**], and [**2109-2-17**].
The cardiology team also feels that should he have another of this congestive heart failure exacerbation, decision will then have to be made as to whether he will benefit from cardiac catheterization.
The patient had significant morbidity from percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement, having subcutaneous emphysema that took a couple of weeks to resolve.
The patient had two episodes of bleeding from the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube site and hemostasis was achieved by surgicel on both occasions.
Interventional radiology was involved on the first bleed and general surgery was curb-sided on the second occasion and they agreed with the plan to use surgicel to achieve hemostasis.
Orthopedic - The patient was diagnosed with a type II odontoid fracture and as per orthopedics, we have kept him in the hard collar which he does not tolerate very well.
because after several discussions, we noted that the patient had a depressed affect.
In summary, the patient is going to be managed conservatively with hopes of formation of collateral flow to his posterior circulation and he will be managed more aggressively from a cardiology standpoint with possible cardiac catheterization if family decides to go ahead with the procedure.
