However patient feeling weak and lightheaded this am and noted to have low BP at HD so sent to ED.
Patient blood pressure in the ED was SBPs in 70s so started on small amount of levophed and SBP increased to 170s with CP and HA so levophed stopped.

The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a severe resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
Mild to moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate mitral stenosis is present as a result of the mitral annular calcification 8.
Mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left vetricular hypertrophy with LVOT obstruction whose severity is likely worse due to levophed and hypovolemia.

Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive on admission likely secondary to volume depletion from hemodialysis.
She had no evidence of infection, and initial broad spectrum antibiotics were discontinued.
She was not restarted on an ACE-I given her relative hypotension, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and the possibility of exacerbating the Venturi effect, though this can be decided by her PCP as an outpatient.
# Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction: This was seen on TTE to be exacerbated by her hypovolemia.
Her metoprolol was titrated up for rate control to improve diastolic filling.
Her ACE-I was held for possibility of exacerbating the Venturi effect and because of her relative hypotension.
# ESRD - The patient has a tunneled line in place in her Left subclavian.
# Chest pain/epigastric discomfort: The patient had 3 episodes of chest pain in the MICU that were concerning for ischemic etiology with new TWI in III, aVF on EKG.
She had an atrial tachycardia post-dialysis on [**4-18**] to the 160s associated with "heartburn" but that improved with IVF and IV lopressor.
She subsquently had several episodes of heartburn on the evening of [**4-18**] that improved with morphine and then with a GI cocktail.
No ACE-I for now given relative hypotension and LVOT.
# History of bilateral subclavian clots.
Maalox Max Quick Dissolve 1,000-60 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) ML PO QID (4 times a day) as needed for heartburn.
