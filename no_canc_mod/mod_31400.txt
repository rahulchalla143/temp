Admission Date:  [**2169-1-28**]              Discharge Date:   [**2169-2-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-1-19**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Tagamet / Ditropan / Penicillins / Lisinopril / Heparin Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**] Chief Complaint: Fvers, admitted from rehab   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy   History of Present Illness: HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 yoM trached, h/o Pseudomonas/Acineterbacter MDR PNA who is admitted from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with T 102.4 and altered MS.  Of note, he was recently admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] MICU green from [**Date range (1) 95399**]/09 for similar system of complaints; he was followed closely by ID and has been on a course of amikacin/inhaled colistin for MDR PNA.
His course was complicated by ARF thought to be [**2-6**] colistin side effect and persistent fevers, for which no cause other than the PNA was ever identified (numerous BCx were negative).
It is unclear whether he was still having intermittent fevers throughout the week, but this morning he spiked and became less arousable.
He was noted to have thick secretions.
Head CT was negative for acute hemorrhage/edema, though there is some question of mastoiditis b/l on the prelim read.
Past Medical History: - [**8-/2168**] fall + subdural hematoma c/by S. bovis endocarditis.
- [**11/2168**] PCN/Vanc sensitive Enterococcal aortic valve endocarditis.
- Morbid obesity - DM type 2 poorly controlled with complications - Chronic renal insufficiency (new baseline as of [**12-12**] - Cr 1.6-2) - HTN - reactive airways disease - h/o asbestos exposure with pleural plaques - GERD - Parkinson's disease - detrusor instability - gout - hypothyroidism - aortic stenosis, valve area 0.9cm2, peak gradient 24, median gradient 48 - Anemia - h/o nephrolithiasis  Social History: -- has wife, [**Name (NI) **], who is HCP; also with two daughters -- no alcohol or tobacco use -- currently resides at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab -- formerly owned pizzaria restuarants   Family History: non-contributory  Physical Exam: PHYSICAL EXAM: VS on arival to MICU: T 100.2, HR 102, BP 143/91, RR 21, 96% on 35% trach collar General: apears comfortable but ill; obese HEENT: PERRL; trached LUNGS: crackles at bases b/l anteriorly; does not cooperate for full exam; some referred upper airway breath sounds CARDIO: RRR, no m/r/g appreciated ABD: + BS, obese, soft, no rebound/guarding, difficult to assess whether TTP EXTREMITIES: 1+ [**Location (un) **], WWP, no rashes; left arm PICC NEURO: somnolent, does not arouse to voice for me (but do so for wife [**Doctor First Name **]; stimulates with pain.
No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
Bilateral opacification of mastoid air cells without osseous destruction.
Small amount of fluid in the sphenoid and right maxillary sinus  ECG [**2169-1-28**]: Sinus tachycardia.
Possible left ventricular hypertrophy (lead aVL).
Non-specific inferolateral T wave flattening.
Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2169-1-11**] the ventricular premature beat is absent and there is increased QRS voltage.
Sinus tachycardia and T wave flattening are new.
ECHO [**2168-2-1**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the mid to distal septum.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0cm2).
Significant aortic regurgitation is present, but cannot be quantified.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-1-4**], the severity of aortic stenosis is similar.
There seems to be a calcified leaflet that is more mobile than seen in the prior echo, possible vegetation.
No definite cause for persistent fevers is noted aside from atelectasis/pleural plaques/scarring within the lungs, particularly at the dependent bases.
No evidence of abscess or infection within the abdomen or pelvis, although assessment is somewhat limited without IV contrast and due to streak artifact from patient's arm positioning.
Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from       this site.
Please contact the Microbiology Laboratory ([**7-/2466**]) immediately if          sensitivity to clindamycin is required on this patient's isolate.
Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as also          RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins, carbacephems,          carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.
MODERATE GROWTH.

disease, complicated medical course since [**8-/2168**] after fall and SDH including endocarditis and MDR PNA with Acinetobacter/Pseudomonas admitted with fever and altered mental status; found to have MRSA PNA.
# Multi-drug resistant Pneumonia:  Patient has history of MDR Pneumonia and was found to have lung consolidation on admission and sputum positive for MRSA.
Patient had respiratory distress on and off during admission requiring intermittent ventilation, likely due to PNA, fluid overload, and component of ICU myopathy.
# Altered mental status: Improved, patient now has PMV in place and answering questions appropriately.
Likely toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in the setting of infection.
Head CT was negative for acute processes.
# CoNS + blood cx bacteremia: ??????
believed unlikely to represent new endocarditis.
# Acute renal failure: Creatinine now stable; improved from 2.8 last discharge [**1-24**].
Likely component of dehydration in the setting of infection but now stable.
# Hypernatremia: Likely dehydration in the setting of infection which has now resolved with free water repletion.
# Parkinson?????
?s disease: No active issues.
Patient to continue on Sinemet and Ropinirole  # Hypothyroidism: No acute issues.
- Continue Levothyroxine 88 mcg  # Diabetes: No acute issues.
Acetaminophen 160 mg/5 mL Solution [**Last Name (STitle) **]: One (1)  PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: MRSA Pneumonia Respiratory Failure   Discharge Condition: Patient afebrile, now on intermittent tracheal mask.
Patient is very weak and will require intensive physical therapy and occupational therapy   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted into the hospital for respiratory distress due to a new Pneumonia.
If you experience worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers > 101 or any other concerning symptoms please notify your doctor immediately or report to the nearest emergency room  Followup Instructions: Please follow up with your Primary Care Physician 1-2 weeks from your discharge from rehab.
