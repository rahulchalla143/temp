Admission Date:  [**2147-3-7**]     Discharge Date:  [**2147-3-14**]  Date of Birth:   [**2093-3-26**]     Sex:  M  Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 1181**]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 35683**] is a 53-year-old male with a history of insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus, multiple past episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis, peripheral neuropathy, and alcohol abuse, who presented with nausea and vomiting and decreased oral intake approximately five days prior to admission which led him to stop taking his insulin approximately four days prior to admission.
He also complained of polydipsia and polyuria after discontinuing his insulin.
On admission, he also noted subjective fevers, no chills.
He also complained of lower chest pain burning and mouth acid burning consistent with prior reflux symptoms.
He had no exertional chest pain, no shortness of breath, no abdominal pain.
Peripheral neuropathy mainly effecting feet bilaterally.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease status post hernia repair.
Coronary artery disease.
Transthoracic echocardiogram in [**2146-8-4**] with global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction estimated at 20-30%.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with diabetes mellitus.
General:  Well-developed disheveled white male in no acute distress.
Neck:  No lymphadenopathy, supple.
Abdomen:  Flat, soft, nontender, nondistended, no masses.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Left foot has an ulcer on the plantar midfoot region with crusted blood, no erythema, no sign of infection.
Skin:  No erythema, no rashes.
Urinalysis: Specific gravity 1.020, greater than 1,000 glucose, greater than 80 ketones, 0-2 white blood cells per high power field, no bacteria, no epithelial cells.
Endocrine:  Patient presented in diabetic ketoacidosis with an anion gap of 70 due to patient not taking insulin in the setting of nausea, vomiting, and decreased po intake.
Cardiac:  The patient ruled in for a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 310 on [**3-8**], peak troponin of 21.8 on [**3-9**].
A non-Q-wave myocardial infarction was likely secondary to diabetic ketoacidosis and not a precipitating factor for diabetic ketoacidosis since cardiac enzymes peaked on hospital days two and three.
Cardiology was consulted, and felt that patient likely does not have active ischemia.
The cardiomyopathy was a result of diabetic microvascular disease.
The patient also has a history of alcohol abuse and thus may have a component of alcoholic cardiac myopathy.
However, given the high peak troponin, there was a small concern for coronary artery disease.
The patient was placed on a Heparin drip for approximately 48 hours, and underwent cardiac catheterization on [**3-13**], which showed no coronary artery disease and normal filling pressures.
Gastrointestinal:  Patient had elevated amylase and lipase with a lipase of 160 and an amylase of 166.
This was thought to be secondary to diabetic ketoacidosis versus mild pancreatitis.
Foot ulcer:  History of Charcot foot, the patient has a left plantar ulcer and no sign of infection.
There is no evidence of osteomyelitis on films.
Depression:  The patient reports decreased mood especially with seasons and decreased motivation.
Diabetic ketoacidosis.
Non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.
