Slight interval improvement in pulmonary edema which is now mild-to-moderate in extent, with small bilateral pleural effusions.
More focal nodular opacities within the right upper lobe and right lower lobe which raise suspicion for superimposed infectious process.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 73 year old female with a history of DM, PVD s/p bilateral BKA, ESRD Afib and diastolic CHF with multiple admissions for acute pulmonary edema (most recent [**2164-1-4**]) who presented with acute SOB.
# SOB: There is likely some degree of flash pulmonary edema in the setting of high BP.
She had a significant improvement in symptoms with NG/afterload reduction.

Of note, she often experiences these symptoms on Sunday due to the extra day before dialysis (she normally has HD MWF).
