Neurology was consulted for hallucinations (visual, responding to internal stimuli) and abnormal behavior (he was almost mute on original neuro consultation).
It was decided to transfer him to the neurology service to rule out temporal lobe epilepsy as a cause of these symptoms.
He was monitored via video EEG for 4 days and had multiple push button events for odd sensatations, none of which were epileptiform.
He had no seizures.
Psychiatry followed closely and felt his acute delirium vs. brief psychotic episodes cleared and was safe for discharge home.
He continues to have a flat/constricted affect.
