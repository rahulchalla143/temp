No new acute intracranial hemorrhage seen.
Interval partial evacuation of a left subdural hematoma, and placement of a catheter into the left extra-axial space.
Residual subdural hematoma overlying the left cerebral convexity posteriorly, with rightward subfalcine herniation of 6 mm.
Voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy.
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities consistent with left ventricular hypertrophy but cannot exclude ischemia.

Cardiac ECHO [**11-4**]: Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
UE US [**11-4**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left arm.
EKG [**11-4**]: Atrial fibrillation with mean ventricular rate 97.
Diffuse non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2174-11-1**] multiple abnormalities as noted persist without major change.
She had a repeat Ct here that showed enlarged subdural and after discussion with family who preferred surgical intervention she was brought to the Or where under general anesthesia she underwent left craniotomy with evacuation SDH.
She had blood transfusions for low hematocrit.
In the early morning [**11-9**], she became fluid overloaded and recieved lasix with good diuresis.
Daughter did not want autopsy due to religious preference.
