The patient breath and nausea, vomiting, chest pain and diaphoresis.
At the [**Hospital 7188**] Hospital she ruled in for myocardial infarction and was diuresed.
While there, the creatinine was noted to increase to 3.1 and the patient became febrile to 102.5.
The patient also had a low hematocrit at 24 and was transfused.
Upon her presentation to the Emergency Room, the patient had little recollection of events but was without symptoms, denied fevers, chills or dysuria.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient is status post renal transplant in [**2138-3-5**] and [**2143-12-6**], chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 2.4 in [**2144-6-5**], coronary artery disease with a moderate anterior reversible defect and an EF of 58%, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, status post appendectomy, status post TAH BSO.
Abdominal exam was soft, nontender, non distended with no tenderness at the graft site.
There is a palpable thrill in the right AV fistula and the patient's skin exam revealed multiple bruises.
EKG revealed sinus rhythm at a rate of [**Street Address(2) 28717**] depression and ST elevations improving from prior EKGs.
Chest x-ray revealed no lung consolidation, no evidence of CHF.
Respiratory:  The patient was watched closely for signs of congestion and signs of congestive heart failure, though none were present at that time.
Renal:  For her increased creatinine which was felt to be secondary to over diuresis in the setting of possible congestive heart failure or graft rejection or sepsis.
Heme:  The patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells for hematocrit of 23.7 given her history of recent myocardial infarction.
The patient was on Heparin for her recent myocardial infarction throughout the placement of the central line.
Within 5 minutes of this transfusion, the patient began to complain of shortness of breath and became stridorous.
Because of the temporal relationship to the blood cell transfusion, it was felt that the patient was likely having an anaphylactic reaction to the transfusion.
During the day of [**8-25**] the patient was noted to have an expanding hematoma and multiple laboratory abnormalities including a low platelet count, acidosis and a hematocrit of 11.8.
Ultrasound of the neck revealed extensive subcutaneous fluid in the neck which was felt to represent either edema or hematoma.
There was no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula in the right neck.
An MRA of the neck was obtained as well which showed the major vessels of the neck to display normal coarse and caliber with the exception of a moderate stenosis in the proximal right ECA.
Because of her history of large bleed into the neck, Aspirin and Heparin were held.
There was concern that the patient may have suffered myocardial ischemia during the acute drop in hematocrit as the CK enzymes declined, there was no further evidence of ongoing ischemia.
The patient did continue to have intermittent hypotension throughout the next several days and began to experience hypotension after hemodialysis which had been started as described below.
There was concern that an infected Quinton catheter may be causing the hypotension related to dialysis vs poor fluid mobilization after dialysis.
The Quinton catheter was changed and after this there were no further hypotensive episodes requiring pressors after hemodialysis.
On [**2144-9-4**] in the setting of hypotension and a temperature spike, blood cultures and urine cultures were sent.
Urine culture ultimately revealed enterococcus for which the patient was treated with Vancomycin for three days.
This was sent for culture and the patient also had a CT scan of the sinuses which was negative for sinusitis.
The patient was started on Flagyl for suspected anaerobic infection.
Ceftaz was added for pseudomonal coverage.
Ultimately, culture data which had been taken on sputum from around the time of the patient's initial temperature spike revealed Enterobacter which was sensitive to Imipenem and indeterminate to Quinolone.
The patient continued on Imipenem for one day and then this was changed to Meropenem because of concerns that Imipenem can lower seizure threshold in patients in end stage renal disease.
Fungal and mycobacterial isolates in the blood were sent and these were also negative.
Temperature remained generally stable with occasional low grade fevers.
The patient developed an increased BUN and creatinine and was noted to have falling urine output.
Lasix and normal saline boluses were then tried and these did increase urine output for a brief period of time.
Continued normal saline boluses and a Lasix drip met with moderate success.
Epogen was started as it was felt that the patient's renal failure may be playing a role in her ongoing anemia.
For the patient's diabetes mellitus she was maintained on a regular insulin sliding scale.
On approximately [**9-15**] the patient was again tried on tube feeds, this time with Reglan in order to increase motility and resolved the patient's problem of high residuals.
On [**2144-9-3**], the patient was found to be hypercalcemia and she received a dose of Pamidronate in order to manage the hypercalcemia.
Following the development of the large neck hematoma, very low hematocrit and need for aggressive resuscitation for hypotension and low hematocrit, there was concern that the patient suffered anoxic/ischemic brain injury.
Neurologic consultation was obtained which revealed no Doll's eye reflex, a positive corneal reflex on the left, no gag reflex, no withdrawal of the upper extremity to pain but withdrawal of the lower extremities bilaterally to pain.
Reflexes were brisk in the upper extremity and the right lower extremity, however, the right lower extremity reflexes were greater than the left lower extremity reflexes.
There was bilateral ankle clonus and toes were upgoing.
MRI of the head performed on [**2144-8-27**] revealed no evidence for a large territorial infarct but two foci of infarctions in the left cerebellar hemisphere which were new compared to a prior CT scan in [**2144-7-5**].
There was some trace increased signal on the diffusion images.
There were multiple scattered foci of increased signal on the trace diffusion images in the left parietal lobe and posterior frontal lobe bilaterally which may represent small regions of ischemia.
There was extensive perivascular white matter, small vessel ischemic disease and the major vessels of the neck were normal in course and caliber with the exception of a moderate stenosis in the proximal right ECA.
Major vessels of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] displayed a normal course and caliber with moderate stenosis in the right ICA in the region of the siphon.
There were no definite signs of intracranial hemorrhage.
The patient was noted to have a rhythmic motion of her lower extremities, questionably related to seizure.
These activities did decrease with empiric Ativan and so patient was empirically started on Dilantin.
On [**2144-8-30**] EEG revealed an abnormal EEG due to the presence of a slow disorganized background with burst of generalized swelling.
This was consistent with a moderate encephalopathy though there was no focal or epileptiform features that were seen.
On [**2144-9-3**], EEG revealed slow and disorganized background with occasional bursts of generalized slowing felt to indicate widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical structures, however, medications, metabolic disturbances and infections were among the most common causes.
Again there were no focal abnormalities or epileptiform features.
Because of a lack of evidence for seizure activity, ultimately Dilantin was discontinued.
The patient's neurologic exam continued to be followed with a goal of assessing this as her renal failure resolved.
Infection was treated as previously noted and renal failure was managed with hemodialysis.
She continued to have an intact Doll's eye reflex, a right corneal reflex but no corneal reflex.
She remained unresponsive to voice.
This revealed burst suppression representing encephalopathy without prominent focal features.
There was a progression to slowing with less prominent suppression which was felt to suggest a lessening of medication effect from Propofol or Lorazepam or other medications.
Again, there were no prominent epileptiform features.
This exam found that in comparison to the study of [**8-27**] there were no major vascular territorial infarcts that had developed.
Again, there were a few punctate foci, slightly elevated signal on the diffusion scans, possibly representing minute areas of evolving ischemia.
There were two small areas of susceptibility within the cerebellar hemispheres.
The patient was again seen by the neurology consult service who felt that given the patient had been weaned off Propofol, had been controlled with hemodialysis and infection had resolved, it was likely that the patient's current neurologic status was representative of her neurologic picture.
Patient was felt to have an unfavorable prognosis.
