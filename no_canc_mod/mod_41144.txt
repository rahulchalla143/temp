History of Present Illness: The patient is a 77 year old female with a history of CAD s/p CABG, insulin dependent diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and achalasia who presents with an episode of right sided chest pain.
The patient reports that over the past week she has been experiencing upper respiratory type symptoms including rhinorrhea, sore throat and mild cough.
She was prescribed azithromycin for a five day course over the phone but did not see a doctor or have a chest xray.
She is currently on her last day of antibiotics and says that these original symptoms have resolved.
She now presents with an episode of right sided chest pain.
She describes the pain as sharp and well localized beneath her right breast.
It does not feel like her typical anginal pain which occurs consistently with exertion and which she describes a pressure across her chest associated with shortness of breath.
She says that this new pain is very similar to that which she had on the left side two months ago when she was diagnosed with a left sided pneumonia at [**Hospital1 1774**].
The patient recently presented to her outpatient cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with worsening anginal symptoms.
She did not experience any symptoms until approximatley two months ago when she started experiencing her anginal symptoms with increasing frequency and severity.
She now experiences chest pain and dyspnea with minimal exertion.
She has a CXR which appears to have evidence of congestion but no clear infiltrates.
She had an elevated D-dimer at 4040.
She did not receive a PE-CT scan given her elevated creatinine.
On review of systems she currently denies lightheadedness, dizziness, fevers, chills, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria, decreased urine output, leg pain or swelling.
She does have chronic back and joint pain.
She has right sided chest pain as described above.
Type II Diabetes - insulin dependent complicated by neuropathy, mild retinopathy, and nephropathy.
Hypertension Hyperlipidemia - poorly treated as patient is intolerant of most lipid lowering agents GERD Achalasia s/p balloon dilation complicated by esophageal perforation and s/p repair Hypothyroidism Arthritis Depression  Social History: Quit smoking 45 years ago.
Family History: She has five children, one passed away of heart disease at the age of 38, another son has known coronary artery disease and is doing well.
Two of her five siblings have heart disease.
Her father died of heart disease.

There is again seen areas of focal consolidation within the right upper lobe, right perihilar region, and left lower lobe.
These findings are more apparent than the prior study and suspicious for infectious/inflammatory etiology.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, stones or masses.
Note is made of a questionable duplex left kidney as noted by a possible column of cortex extending across the mid-to-upper pole.
The urinary bladder is not visualized and likely empty.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right and left common femoral, superficial, and popliteal veins were performed.
There is no evidence of intraluminal thrombus.
CTA OF THE CHEST: There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
In the tracheo-esophageal space, there is soft tissue thickening, likely lymphadenopathy.
There are multiple areas of consolidation throughout all lobes of the lungs, predominantly in the superior portion of the left lower lobe and apical portion of the right upper lobe.
Smaller foci of consolidation are seen within the right middle lobe and lingula.
There is a moderate-sized right pleural effusion, layering dependently, measuring simple fluid density.
There is also a smaller left- sided pleural effusion layering dependently and extending into the major fissure, also measuring simple fluid density.
A punctate calcification is noted at the left lung base, likely a granuloma.
A prominent prevascular lymph node is noted anterior to the aortic arch measuring 9 mm in short axis.
There are other small mediastinal lymph nodes including a 7-mm left prevascular lymph node, 6-mm precarinal lymph node, and a prominent subcarinal lymph node which is not easily distinguished from the esophagus.
There are dense calcifications within the native coronary arteries, particularly the LAD and its branches.
There is no pericardial effusion.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic assessment.
Multilevel degenerative changes are noted throughout the thoracic spine.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Moderate right and small left pleural effusions, likely reactive to the pneumonic process.
Significant tracheomalacia with probable lymphadenopathy posterior to the trachea.
Echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets and supporting structures are mildly thickened.
At least mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The severity of aortic stenosis is increased and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now present.
Is there a history to suggest a primary pulmonary process (e.g., pulmonary embolism, bronchospasm, COPD exacerbation, etc.?).
Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed native three-vessel disease.
--the LMCA had diffuse disease, with greatest stenosis being 90%.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right-sided filling pressures, with RVEDP 29 mmHg.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI3 flow (see ptca  comments).
CXR to check ETT placement and r/o PTX as well as assess for  infiltrate given extubation episode with emesis.
Renal u/s with doppler   Brief Hospital Course: Assessment/Plan:  77 year old female with a history of CAD s/p CABG, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and achalasia who originally admitted with NSTEMI and pneumonia who developed acute respiratory distress likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema requiring emergent intubation.
Coronary Artery Disease:  On presentation the patient endorsed crescendo anginal type symptoms.
On admission she was found to have elevated troponins consistent with an NSTEMI.
Given that she presented in acute renal failure with evidence of a new pneumonia urgent catheterization was deferred at that time.
In the afternoon of [**2162-1-4**] the patient suffered an episode of flash pulmonary edema requiring emergent intubation.
There was initial concern that she was experience an acute coronary syndrome at that time.
The patient has a baseline EKG with LBBB.
She underwent emergent catheterization which revealed occluded vein grafts with the exception of the LIMA-LAD.
Her cardiac enzymes did not increase following this acute event.
Following her catheterization she did not experience any further episodes of chest pain.
Given that the patient showed signs of congestive failure her atenolol was switched to carvedilol.
She tolerated only 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] secondary to bradycardia.
Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF:  The patient underwent repeat echocardiogram on [**2162-1-4**] which showed mildly dilated [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] >55%, mild symmetric LVH, moderately thickened AV, moderate AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 1.2cm), 1+ AR, 1+ MR, mod PA systolic HTN and preserved global LV systolic function.
In the afternoon of [**2162-1-4**] the patient had an episode of acute respiratory distress requiring intubation.
It was thought that this was most likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of a receiving a high osmotic fluid load during CTA.
She was switched from atenolol to carvedilol for her heart failure.
She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8906**] for her heart failure and her primary care physician for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] repeat creatinine and potassium check.
With increased doses of beta blocker she had more profound episodes of bradycardia in the 30s.
She also was noted to have short episodes of NSVT on telemetry.
These were reduced in frequency with the addition of carvedilol.
Pneumonia: On admission the patient was noted to have a multifocal pneumonia on CXR.
Initially there was concern for pulmonary embolism given that she presented with pleuritic chest pain with an elevated D-dimer.
She had bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds which were negative and a CTA showed clear evidence of diffuse infiltrates.
She completed a ten day course of ceftriaxone with improvement in her pain as well as her respiratory status.
Acute Renal Failure: On admission the patient's creatinine was 1.9 from a baseline of 1.0.
Her FeNa was 0.6% consistent with a prerenal etiology.
She had bilateral renal ultrasounds which were negative for hydronephrosis.
Respiratory Failure: As above the patient required emergent intubation for respiratory distress likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
On discharge she was satting well on room air and was ambulating without shortness of breath.
Iron function studies were consistent with anemia of inflammation.
Urinary Tract Infection:  On [**2162-1-9**] the patient was noted to have a positive UA and a WBC count of 14.
She was afebrile but given that she had an indwelling foley catheter at that time there was concern that she had developed a UTI.
She was continued on neurontin at decreased doses given her presentation with acute renal failure.
She was continued on her outpatient ipratropium with albuterol as needed for increased wheezing.
Prophylaxis:  She received both IV heparin and subcutaneous heparin during this admission for DVT prophylaxis.
Albuterol 90 mcg/Actuation Aerosol Sig: 1-2 Puffs Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.

You were found to have multiple areas of pneumonia and were treated with 10 days of antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia.
Your course was complicated by a heart attack and acute pulmonary edema requiring emergent intubation and cardiac cathterization.
You also developed a urinary tract infection, which was treated with antibiotics.
Please call your doctor or 911 if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, new neurologic symptoms, or any other concerning symptoms.
