When compared to prior, there has been partial resolution of the bilateral parenchymal opacities seen on prior.
There is however persistent left basilar opacity.
Both could be due to atelectasis, aspiration or infection is also possible.
IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in the appearance of the lungs with some persistent left basilar opacity, potentially atelectasis versus aspiration/infection and small probable right pleural effusion.
CXR [**6-13**]: FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increase in extent of a pre-existing small pleural effusion and a newly occurred small right pleural effusion.
Subsequently, areas of atelectasis are seen at the lung bases.
In addition, the pre-existing left basal opacity with air bronchograms persists.
The presence of aspiration pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette, no pulmonary edema.
