Echo The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include apical hypokinesis/akinesis/dyskinesis; cannot exclude mid lateral hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**11-30**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
