URINE CULTURE (Preliminary):       ESCHERICHIA COLI.
with acetaminophen/diphenhydramine overdose from a suicide attempt found down and was admitted to the hospital with rhabdomyolysis and acute hepatitis.
The patient's liver synthetic dysfunction also was impacted with her INR increasing to a peak of 4.2.
2) Rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury: The patient developed acute kidney injury with creatinine elevating to a peak of 2.5.
3) Suicide attempt: The patient's attempt was determined to be a serious attempt with low chance of rescue and premeditation.
4) Urinary tract infection: The patient developed a fever on Day 5 of her admission and was found to have a urinary tract infection by E-coli.
A repeat hematocrit was performed on the same day of the bowel movement which contained blood, and showed a stable hematocrit at the time of discharge.
Iron studies did not show an iron deficiency anemia, and a reticulocyte index was low; it was thought that the damage sustained to the kidneys may have temporarily decreased the amount of Erythropoietin produced, but that with further kidney recovery, the hematocrit would also improve.
6) Respiratory distress: The patient developed mild pulmonary edema and tachypnea during her hospitalization secondary to IV fluids for her acute kidney injury.
7) History of hepatitis C: Patient's viral load on this admission zero, therefore she had cleared her hep C.  8) Substance abuse: The patient came in on 75mg methadone daily for history of IVDU; this was decreased to 45mg in the setting of liver failure, but had been returned to her home dose by time of discharge.
