Severe diffuse bilateral airspace opacities might represent pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage or widespread infection.
Endotracheal tube ending 4.8 cm above the carina  ECHO [**2124-10-17**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF = 15 %) secondary to akinesis of the entire posterior wall, and hypokinesis (with regional variation) of the rest of the left ventricle - basal segments relatively well-preserved.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.

There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.

CXR [**2124-10-18**]: IMPRESSION:  Almost complete resolution of bilateral diffuse airspace opacifications consistent with diagnosis of pulmonary edema.
Cardiac MRI [**2124-10-20**]: Mildly enlarged left atrium and normal size right atrium.
Moderately hypokinesis of the other ventricular segments with probable dyssynchrony also present.
Transmural late gadolinium enhancement of the antero-basal and mid-basal antero-lateral wall, consistent with fibrosis or scar, and low likelihood of contractile recovery after revascularization.

# Wide-complex tachycardia: SVT with abarrancy vs. sinus tachycardia.
ECG on admission consistent with sinus tachycrdia + LBBB.
Most likely this is tachycardia secondary to heart failure, pulmonary edema and possibly COPD exacerbation.
Ischemia nevertheless should be ruled out given his history.
An ECHO was obtained that showed overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF = 15 %) secondary to akinesis of the entire posterior wall, and hypokinesis (with regional variation) of the rest of the left ventricle - basal segments relatively well-preserved.
However, there was difficulty finding focus with voltage map and was unable to induce VT. Pt kept having PVCs and may be coming from an epicardial focus.
CXR after procedure showed leads in correct place and without complication.
# Resp distress: CXR on admission consistent with pulmonary edema.
Patient with known systolic CHF with LVEF = 40% per echo [**2121**].
of contributing underlying COPD exacerbation +/- pneumonia (may have had aspiration during his dramatic intubation).
ECHO on admission showed EF of 15%, likely secondary to myocardial stunning.
# CORONARIES: initially presented with CP, has history of Lcx instent restenosis in [**2121**].
Cardiac enzymes were initially trended and were initially elevated and trop up t 0.28 with elevated but flat CK and CKMB.
Diabetic education was provided prior to discharge.
# Non-compliance: The patient has a h/o non-compliance and was only taking an aspirin prior to coming to the hospital.
Diabetic education was provided as well as it was stressed the importance of his new medications and following up with the scheduled appointments as well as establishing care with primary care doctor.
He was set up with a home VNA prior to discharge to provide medication teaching, diabetes teaching, and education.
# Alcohol Abuse: The patient had no signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal throughout the hospitalization.
Diabetes Supplies Glucometer   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Company 1519**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on Chronic Systolic congestive heart failure Coronary artery disease Ventricular tachycardia Diabetes Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 8273**],  You had a irregular looking tachycardia at [**Hospital3 7569**] and it was shocked multiple times.
We do not feel that you had a heart attack.
An electrophysiology study showed the rhythm was ventricular tachycardia.
Your heart is weaker after the shocks and you are at risk for fluid accumulation in your legs and lungs.
