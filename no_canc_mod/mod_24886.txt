Admission Date:  [**2112-2-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2112-2-13**]  Date of Birth:  [**2032-4-5**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Augmentin / Keflex / Toprol Xl  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**] Chief Complaint: Right side pain, cough  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old man with a history of atrial fibrillation, COPD and CHF s/p aortic and mitral valve replacement who presents with 1 day of right-sided chest pain.
He was in his usual state of health - living in an [**Hospital 4382**] facility and taking budesonide, xopenex, and ipratropium nebulizers once a day with baseline congestion and sputum production - until one week prior to admission, when he began to experience increased congestion, increased frequency of cough, and increased sputum production.
He denies fevers, chills, exposure to any known allergens, or sick contacts.
One day prior to admission, he noticed minimal blood streaking in his sputum.
He woke up at 1 am with a pain along his right chest, which he described as sharp, [**9-23**], and focally over his lateral rib, and worse upon deep inspiration, coughing, palpation, or movement.
He denies vomiting or diarrhea, epistaxis, melena, hematochezia, or hematuria.
He denies a history of aspiration or any difficulty with swallowing.
The next morning, he called a staff member and told her that he was having right-sided chest pain.
He came to the hospital via EMS because he had not experienced this pain before.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation and ST depression v3-6.
No prior EKGs for comparison.
The cardiology fellow felt that the ST depressions represented demand ischemia.
A CXR was done which showed RML and RLL infiltrate suggestive of pneumonia.
He reports that the pain resolved while in the ED.
He had a brief episode of hypotension with SBP 89 while in the ED; this responded rapidly to fluids.
He was asymptomatic during this episode.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision changes, lightheadedness or dizziness, sore throat, left-sided chest pain or pressure, abdominal pain, changes in his bowel or bladder habits, BRBPR, dysuria, myalgias, arthralgias, sick contacts.
Atrial fibrillation, on coumadin and verapamil 2.
Coronary artery disease s/p CABG 4.
Hypothyroidism 6.
Prostate cancer, s/p local chemotherapy and radiation therapy, with chronic indwelling foley 7.
Sacral decubitus ulcer   Social History: Lives in Atria, an [**Hospital3 **] facility in which he lives in independent housing.
Gen: Alert, appears his stated age, appears slightly uncomfortable but in no acute distress.
OP clear, no exudates or lesions noted.
Neck: Soft, no palpable lymphadenopathy, no appreciable JVP.
Resp: Crackles heard at R lung base and R axilla, w/ dullness to percussion and egophany.
Moderate air movement.
Abd: +BS, soft, nontender, nondistended, no rebound tenderness or guarding GU: Condom catheter draining concentrated urine MSK: Significant kyphosis and scoliosis of the spine.
Ext: Significant erythema and pitting edema of the LE (wearing compression stockings) to knees.
R edema > L edema, per patient is chronic.
No calf pain.
Venous stasis skin changes over feet and medial lower legs bilaterally.
2+ pitting edema b/l with R>L.
Some very mild memory and/or concentration deficits during conversation (would lose train of thought and forget the original question).
Good insight and recall for distant memories with only few lapses in memory or difficulty finding words.
MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2112-2-12**]):    No MRSA isolated.
STUDIES: EKG - showed STD v3-6, afib with HR ~100.
[**2-8**] CXR - Right middle lobe pneumonia.
[**2-10**] TTE - The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension raising the suspicion for a primary pulmonary process (e.g., pulmonary embolism, bronchospasm, pneumonia, exacerbation of COPD, etc.)
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function.
[**2-10**] CXR - Findings are very concerning for right lung pneumonia but asymmetric CHF is a possibility.
[**2-11**] CXR - There is interval improvement in the right upper lobe opacity compared to the prior study consistent with interval resolving aspiration.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including the sternal wires and replaced most likely mitral valve.
Brief Hospital Course: 79yoM with COPD, CHF, AVR/MVR on Coumadin, ?afib presenting with productive cough and infiltrate on CXR suggestive of right middle lobe pneumonia.
# Pneumonia:  Patient presents from [**Hospital3 **] facility with productive cough and CXR with right mild infiltrate suggestive of pneumonia.
He was also re-started on his home nebs, which he had been minimally compliant with (taking [**1-16**] nebs 1-2 times per day rather than 3 nebs tid), as it was believed the patient was having a COPD exacerbation in setting of PNA and non-compliance with nebulizer treatments.
However, the patient's oxygen saturation then decreased to the 80's on 4L NC and he was changed to a non-rebreather and sent to the MICU for respiratory distress.
Patient was started on steriod burst for component of COPD exacerbation.
TTE was done and showed preserved systolic function.
He received a PICC and was discharged to rehab on Cefepime for a total 10 day course, as the patient's MRSA swab was negative and the suspicion for MRSA PNA was negative.
# Atrial Fibrillation:  Patient with history of a fib on Verapamil (as patient becomes bradycardic on Toprol; listed as "allergy") and had a fib with RVR in the 100's in the setting of not receiving his home medications.
Cardiology assessed the pt in the ED and felt ST depressions in precordial leads on EKG were demand ischemia.
CE's negative (Trop minimally elevated but stable x2, negative CK-MB).
# COPD:  Likely COPD exacerbation in setting of PNA, as above.
Was started on a steroid burst in the MICU for suspected COPD exacerbation in the setting of likely aspiration pneumonia, and was discharged with a short taper.
# AVR/MVR:  Porcine valves, no need for anticoagulation.
# CAD s/p CABG:  Home Coumadin was initially held in the setting of INR 5.5, which rose to 9.8 the following day off Coumadin on antibiotics, and Vitamin K 5mg po x1 was given.
# Chronic Anemia:  Per patient's primary care physician NP, patient's baseline Hct ~39.
Pt's Hct has been stable ~32 during his hospital stay, and there was no evidence of hemolysis.
Likely dilutional anemia superimposed on anemia of chronic disease.
# CHF:  No evidence of volume overload.
# Chronic Back pain/Spinal Stenosis:  Patient was maintained on his home Tramadol.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Doctor First Name 391**] Bay - [**Hospital1 392**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Bilateral Pneumonia Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Exacerbation  Secondary Diagnosis: - Atrial fibrillation - Coronary Artery Disease - Chronic Congestive Heart Failure (Diastolic) - Prostate CA s/p chemotherapy and XRray Therapy, with chronic foley - Hypothyroidism - Back pain [**2-16**] spinal stenosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status:Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive Activity Status:Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: You presented to the hospital for a cough and right sided chest wall pain.
You were found to have a pneumonia of both your right and left lungs, likely due to aspiration.
While in the hospital, your atrial fibrillation caused you to have a rapid heart rate which was treated with an increased dose of your home Verapamil.
