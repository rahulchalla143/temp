Pregnancy was complicated by cervical shortening and preterm labor, treated with bed rest and betamethasone at 25 weeks.
On the day of delivery, preterm labor progressed and the infants were delivered by cesarean section.
He was intubated in the delivery room for respiratory distress and admitted to the newborn intensive care unit.
HEART: Grade 2 out of 6, high pitched systolic murmur, left sternal border.
Hernia repair incision clean, dry and intact with scrotal edema.
He was treated for significant RDS with 3 doses of surfactant, requiring brief periods on high frequency ventilation and muscle relaxation before transition to conventional ventilation.
He required reintubation on day of life 10 for increased apnea and was subsequently extubated on day of life 26.
He has completed three days without any significant apneic or bradycardic episodes or spells.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  [**Known lastname 1104**] demonstrated mild hypotension early in life requiring dopamine support for approximately 2 days.
Follow up echo on day of life 5 showed small patent ductus arteriosus and repeat echo on day of life 34, [**2156-2-27**], showed no patent ductus arteriosus but arterial collateral from the end to side of aortic arch.
Mild hypertension was also noted in the first week of life.
Renal function was adequate and hypertension resolved.
Within 48 hours she developed abdominal distension with pneumatosis and began treatment for presumed necrotizing enterocolitis.
He was started on enteral feeds with Special Care 20 on day of life 35 and within 3 days developed abdominal distention requiring holding feeds.
At that time he developed bloody stools with dilated intestinal loops.
On day of life 65, [**2156-3-29**], he developed grossly bloody stools, pink rust in colors with streaks of visible blood with abdominal distention.
KUB showed pneumatosis in right lower quadrant with dilated intestinal loops.
Initial WBC and platelet counts were normal although repeat WBC on [**3-30**] showed borderline neutropenia with white count of 6.5 with 50% neutrophils and 3 bands.
Neocate feeds began with a gradual advancement.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The infant was initially treated with phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity which resolved subsequently.
LFTs were mildly elevated at that time with AST of 93, and ALT of 43.
Abdominal ultrasound was performed on [**3-26**] which showed several small stones in the gallbladder but with normal liver parenchyma and no biliary duct dilatation.
Liver dysfunction was presumed secondary to PN cholestasis.
That surgery proceeded without complications and both hernia sites are healing nicely.
He experienced mild thrombocytopenia in the first week of life not requiring platelet transfusion.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE: Initial CBC was negative, blood cultures were negative, but the infant received 7-days of ampicillin and cefotaxime after birth due to significant clinical illness.
He also received another 7 days of Zosyn, started on [**3-29**], which ended on [**2156-4-4**], for presumed recurrent necrotizing enterocolitis.
The infant was maintained on prophylactic ampicillin or amoxicillin, and other antibiotics for hydronephrosis until ultrasound on [**3-26**] showed this to be resolved.
Urinalysis was negative but urine culture subsequently grew Enterobacter and Cloacae which was sensitive to piperacillin and gentamycin.
Urine culture sent on [**4-17**] grew Enterobacter greater than 100,000 and E. coli between 10,000 to 100,000.
GENITOURINARY: Renal ultrasound was performed on [**1-27**] due to mild hypertension and moderate bilateral hydronephrosis noted.
Repeat ultrasound on [**2-12**] showed mild right hydronephrosis and repeat ultrasound on [**3-26**] showed no hydronephrosis with some echogenic debris seen at the tips of the renal medullary pyramids bilaterally as well as in the bladder on his last ultrasound.
Repeat renal ultrasound on [**4-27**], showed no hydronephrosis but was consistent with nephrocalcinosis.
OPHTHALMOLOGY: The infant received thorough eye examinations without evidence of adenopathy of prematurity.
5.  with chronic lung disease.
6.  hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.
Before this age and for the first 24 months of the     child's life, immunization against influenza is     recommended for household contacts and out of home     caregivers.
Respiratory distress syndrome 3.
Mild bronchopulmonary dysplasia 4.
Presumed sepsis 5.
Necrotizing enterocolitis 7.
Presumed allergic colitis 8.
Apnea and bradycardia of prematurity 10.
