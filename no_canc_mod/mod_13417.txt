The patient's cardiac enzymes were negative for myocardial infarction.
Status post MI [**62**] years ago.
No carotid bruits.
No thyromegaly.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Lab on day of admission, [**2155-8-19**], where they found 85% ostial LAD lesion proximal to the area previously stented, with a 60% in-stent restenosis, mild proximal circumflex disease, heavily calcified RCA with midvessel occlusion.
The patient was referred to cardiac surgery for operative repair of his coronary artery disease.
In the operating room, transesophageal echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction greater than 55% with mild mitral regurgitation prior to the operation, which was reduced to trace mitral regurgitation after revascularization.
On postoperative day #0, the patient required a moderate amount of volume resuscitation with subsequent blood transfusions.
The patient continued to be hypotensive in the Intensive Care Unit requiring Neo-Synephrine to maintain adequate blood pressure.
On the evening of postoperative day #3, while the patient had previously been A-paced for sinus bradycardia, the patient went into atrial fibrillation with rates 150-160 which was controlled with IV and PO Lopressor.
On postoperative day #4, the patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the floor where he remained stable without any further atrial fibrillation.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm without rub or murmur.
Lungs are clear bilaterally without wheezes, rhonchi or rales.
