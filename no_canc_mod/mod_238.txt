Admission Date:  [**2148-4-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2148-4-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2069-6-14**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Phenobarbital  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2927**] Chief Complaint: transferred for seizure management   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation Long Term EEG monitoring   History of Present Illness: 78yo RH M h/o brain tumor s/p R frontal resection in [**2132**], CAD, hyperlipidemia, prostate cancer s/p XRT and seizure disorder who is transferred for increasing seizures.
He initially presented to OSH on [**3-29**] with "symptoms of left-sided hand weakness and clumsiness of 3 days duration", worse from a baseline weakness on the left subsequent to tumor resection.
He also complained of slowly progressive deterioration in his gait over several months, leaning to the left.
He was admitted with seizures and found to have UTI and hypoxia due to poor mucous clearance, all per his discharge summary.
Head CT was negative for acute stroke.
MRI showed a "cystic/encephalomalacic change in the right superior frontal gyrus and left medial cerebellar hemisphere without evidence of enhancement."
EEG seems to have had right frontal seizure focus/slowing.
On [**3-31**], he was "noted to have seizure activity" though this is not further specified; depakote was found to be subtherapeutic and the dose was increased.
He "continued to have intermittent episodes of seizure activity with hypoxia".
He was started empirically on zosyn for aspiration pneumonia; UA was positive for UTI with pseudomonas.
The patient was tranferred here [**4-1**] for further care and intubated on arrival for respiratory distress.
On morning rounds at 9:25am, he was observed to have 30sec of left hand shaking then his left face, with right gaze deviation and eye opening/closure and no responsiveness.
Past Medical History: - Brain tumor (path unknown) dx'd [**2132**] s/p resection - Angina s/p PTCA @ [**Hospital1 1774**] - Hyperlipid - Prostate Ca s/p XRT   Social History: Lives with wife, needs help with ambulating and dressing.
Family History: unknown  Physical Exam: VS 98.3/100.0 64-95 106-148/47-75 [**8-27**] 1266/272 100% Gen Lying in bed in NAD Neck supple CV rrr no bruits Pulm ctab Abd soft benign Ext no edema .
No preference in visuospatial attention.
CN III, IV, VI: EOMI no nystagmus CN V: b/l corneal reflex; symmetrical grimace to nasal tickle CN VII: full facial symmetry and strength CN VIII: hearing intact to FR b/l .
Sensory withdraws to pain in all extremities.
Admission CXR [**4-2**]: There is no focal abnormality in the lungs to indicate aspiration but elevation of the left hemidiaphragm may reflect acute volume loss from aspirated material in the left lower lobe bronchus.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Most recent CXR [**2148-4-15**]: Ill-defined right infrahilar opacity persists with no new focal infiltrates or evidence of pulmonary edema.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
Nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach and linear opacity projecting over the right neck is likely external to the patient.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged right infrahilar opacity, likely representing aspiration pneumonia.
No evidence of new infiltrates or pulmonary edema .
MRI Head: FINDINGS:  The patient is status post remote craniotomy and resection of a small portion of the right frontal lobe with surrounding gliosis.
Periventricular FLAIR hyperintensity likely represents a combination of small vessel ischemic changes and chronic changes from radiation.
No intracranial mass, hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures, or evidence of abnormal enhancement is identified.
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci is slightly pronounced for patient's age.
There is no evidence of acute minor or major vascular territorial infarct.
Opacification of multiple mastoid air cells is noted.
IMPRESSION:  Status post remote resection of a small portion of the right frontal lobe with no evidence of new mass or abnormal enhancement .
ABNORMALITY #2: Over the left hemisphere, a [**5-9**] Hz slow posterior background rhythm was noted throughout the tracing.
HYPERVENTILATION: Contraindicated due to patient's mental status.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the low voltage right hemisphere delta slowing and the left hemisphere background slowing.
This suggests right hemisphere subcortical dysfunction.
The left hemisphere background slowing suggests a mild encephalopathy, which may be seen with infections, medication effect, or toxic metabolic abnormalities .
Two appeared to have onset in the right temporal region with subsequent spread to the left hemisphere and then involvement of both hemispheres quite prominently and were characterized by a gagging or coughing sound at onset followed by left arm elevation and shaking.
Three seizures appear to have exclusively left temporal onset with subsequent spread to the remainder of the left hemisphere and the right temporal region prominently and were not characterized by any visible clinical change on video.
No interictal epileptiform discharges were seen.
The background was slow and disorganized throughout the recording suggestive of a mild to moderate encephalopathy .
These all began with rhythmic sharp changes in the right frontal region typically spreading to rapid sharp alpha frequency activity of high amplitude in the left temporal region and then rapid sharp high amplitude alpha activity throughout much of the brain.
Clinically, the patient had gagging or coughing noises occasionally with additional mouth movements or with elevation and clonic shaking of the left arm.
No interictal epileptiform discharges were seen.
The background was slow and disorganized throughout the recording suggestive of a moderate encephalopathy .
Most recent EEG, [**4-10**]: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
There were no electrographic seizures or interictal epilepiform discharges.
The background was mostly slow and disorganized in the theta frequency range throughout the day's recording although some periods of alpha frequency activity were seen on occasion.
These findings suggest the presence of a mild to moderate encephalopathy.
His valproate level was found to be therapeutic initially and he was seen to have left-sided focal seizures of his arm/face (thought to be due to R frontal tumor resection).
Continuous EEG monitoring showed electrographic seizures with R temporal onset (see full EEG report above).
After initiation of Keppra and up-titration of Depakote seizures slowed and then stopped on telemetry.
He finished a course of Zosyn -> Ceftazadime for aspiration PNA.
Floor Course: MRI Head was performed (see results above) and showed the remote resection of a small portion of the right frontal lobe with no evidence of new mass or abnormal enhancement or infarct.
He had no further seizures on the floor.
He had some episodes of desaturation, but given that he was afebrile and CXR findings were stable, these were felt to be due to mucous plugging.
Given that he did not have any further seizures, we therefore decided to wean off his Keppra.
A decision was made not to proceed with PEG for long term nutrition given that there was some chance that his swallowing would continue to improve as Keppra came out of his system.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] Northeast - [**Location (un) 1110**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Left focal motor seizures   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Please notify your doctor if you develop any further left arm shaking or seizures, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrea, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other symptoms that concern you.
