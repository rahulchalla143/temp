Past Medical History: -- Hypertension -- Hyperlipidemia -- BPH; s/p turp x2 -- Gout -- Impaired glucose tolerance -- Interstitial lung disease with diminished DLCO (thought [**12-21**] to pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema as per Pulmonary).
B/L pleural thickening and honeycombing on CT -- dCHF/ Cor pulmonale -- Obesity.
-- Diabetes mellitus 2, diet controlled -- hiatal hernia -- sleep apnea -- R sided renal lesion -- CKD - baseline creatinine is 1.6-1.7 -- Abdominal aortic aneurysm.
-- Hypothyroidism .
Family History: Non-Contributory  Physical Exam: VSS: 97.7, 98, 141/87, 98% on 100%02NRB, changed to 4L NC, SAT90-93% GEN: Comfortable appearing, in NAD HEENT: Pupils unequal 6mmR, 4mmL, RRL, EOMI, mildly icteric sclera.
PULM: rales bilaterally throughout, sparse at apex, no rhonchi or wheezing.
3cmx4cm cicular ulcer on R ant.
lower leg, w clear, yellow drainage onto bandage, mild surrounding erythema, no necrosis, no pus.
Non tender calf or later leg or foot.
NEURO: CNII-XII intact, strength 5/5 upper ext and ankles, toes downgoing bilaterally, sensation to light touch intact, no finger to nose ataxia.
There is no significant interval change in predominantly basal and subpleural interstitial abnormalities consistent with known pulmonary fibrosis.
There are no acute focal consolidations.
[**8-10**]: Increased interstitial markings are again demonstrated.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for right-sided heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, COPD, interstital lung disease, DM 2, and CRI admitted for hypoxia and a RLE ulcer.
Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Most likely etiology to dyspnea and hypoxia are fluid overload in setting of severe right sided heart failure and pulmonary hypertension, as well as increasing ascites.
In addition, the patient underwent a therapeutic paracentesis with 4 liters of ascites taken off with significant improvement in symptoms.
CHF: Patient with significant pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure on last TTE with preserved EF.
COPD/Interstitial lung disease: Currently stable.
Upper GIB: Patient with one episode of coffee ground emesis in the ED.
Of note, the patient has a prior episode of coffee ground emesis during his last admission to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**5-27**].
Given the the patient's significant right heart failure and congestive hepatopathy, he may likely have varices although this cannot be confirmed without EGD.
He was initially started on an IV PPI for potential bleeding ulcer, which was converted to PO PPI on discharge.
Coagulopathy: Patient with INR of 1.5 during admission, likely secondary to malnutrition and hepatic congestion.
Ascites: Patient with SAAG of 1.1 with TP>2.5 suggestive of congestive hepatopathy.
Medications on Admission: as per OMR: ALBUTEROL SULFATE [PROAIR HFA] - 90 mcg HFA Aerosol Inhaler - 1  to 2 puffs inhaled up to four times a day as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing ALLOPURINOL - 100 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth DAILY (Daily)  BIPAP - (Prescribed by Other Provider) - - 11cm inspiratory and 7 cm expiratory along with 4 L/min 02 FINGERTIP OXIMETER - - use at home to monitor exertional hypoxemia FLUOXETINE - 10 mg Capsule - 1 (One) Capsule(s) by mouth once a  day FUROSEMIDE [LASIX] - 80 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth twice a  day- Changed to TID per patient.
Particle/Crystal(s) by mouth once a day ZOLPIDEM - 5 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth HS (at bedtime) as  needed for insomnia  Medications - OTC ASPIRIN - (OTC) - 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)
Pulse dose for portability.
Dyspnea/hypoxia 2.
Cellulitis  Secondary -- Hypertension -- Hyperlipidemia -- BPH; s/p turp x2 -- Gout -- Impaired glucose tolerance -- Interstitial lung disease with diminished DLCO (thought [**12-21**] to pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema as per Pulmonary).
B/L pleural thickening and honeycombing on CT -- dCHF/ Cor pulmonale -- Obesity.
-- Diabetes mellitus 2, diet controlled -- hiatal hernia -- obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP -- R sided renal lesion -- CKD - baseline creatinine is 1.6-1.7 -- Abdominal aortic aneurysm.
-- Hypothyroidism   Discharge Condition: Patient was discharged in stable condition.
You were admitted for shortness of breath.
This was due to excessive fluid retention.
You were found to have a cellulitis, or skin infection on your right leg.
