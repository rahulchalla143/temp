Morning of admission he returned to [**Location **] with worsening, constant left arm pain and heart burn symptoms.
EKG in the ED revealed ST segment elevations in leads II, III and aVF (III>II) with also lateral V5, V6 ST segment elevations.

Abnormal tracing.
Inferior Q waves which are new in comparison to the preceding tracing.
Inferior and anterior ST segment elevation which is less marked.
Inferior myocardial infarction with persistent ST segment elevation in the inferior and anterior leads.
Anterolateral myocardial infarction with anterolateral ST segment elevation.
Anterolateral Q waves are newly noted in the anterolateral and inferior ST segment elevations are more marked.
Abnormal tracing.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severe systemic arterial hypertension with transient bradycardia and hypotension resolved with 0.5mg atropine.
Left-sided filling pressure was mildly elevated with LVEDP of 24 mmHg.
Systemic arterial hypertension.
Elevated left-sided filling pressures with LVEDP of 24 mmHg.
-   Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2109-3-23**] at 12:24:25 PM FINAL  -  The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF = 45 %) secondary to akinesis of the inferior free wall, hypokinesis of the inferior septum, and hypokinesis of the apex (with a small area of focal apical dyskinesis).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: inferior and apical contractile dysfunction  - CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2109-3-23**] 6:27 AM -  FINDINGS: No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is seen on this single view.
There is no mediastinal widening.
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 69500**] is a 53 year old gentleman with history of long term tobacco use who was admitted with acute inferior STEMI s/p PCI BMS to mid-RCA.
# Inferior STEMI: Presenting symptoms of severe left arm pain as well as abdominal pain.
Culprit lesion was 95% mid-RCA lesion s/p BMS PCI with resolution of ST segment elevations inferiorly post intervention.
He remained hemodynamically stable and without conduction abnormalities on EKG and telemetry.
Left arm pain persisted initially to milder degree in the CCU with mild STE in V3-V5 (worsened from post-intervention ECG); nitro drip was initiated for about 24 hours and then weaned off, but ECG changes were then attributed to aneurysm vs reperfusion.
TTE showed mildly depressed EF 45%, with akinesis of the inferior free wall, hypokinesis of the inferior septum, and hypokinesis of the apex.
INACTIVE ISSUES:  # Question Hx Chronic Pancreatitis: Chronic, stable without abdominal pain.
Held pancreatic enzymes during this hospitalization.
