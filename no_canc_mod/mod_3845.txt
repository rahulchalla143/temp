The patient had associated nausea and vomiting.
In the Emergency Room electrocardiogram revealed ST elevations in leads V1 through V3.
He also stated he recently had a history of an episode of transient monocular blindness and transient right arm weakness with subsequent MRA revealing normal vasculature.
In the catheterization laboratory the patient was found to have clean coronary arteries and was transferred back to the Cardiology floor in stable condition.
History of seizure disorder.
History of hematuria with a negative ultrasound except for a simple cyst of his right kidney.
Arachnoid cyst in his left anterior temporal lobe with an otherwise normal MRA on [**2156-12-18**].
ALLERGIES:  He had no known drug allergies.
He also had CK/MB and troponin drawn.
The question was whether or not he had a thromboembolic event given his sketchy neurologic symptoms.
He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21662**] of Cardiology who noted a [**1-4**] holosystolic murmur at the apex and a soft early diastolic murmur.
He had good peripheral pulses, and no bruits.
On the following morning, on [**12-27**], he was seen again by Cardiology by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 46**] who agreed that there may be some infectious disease process going on with a possible of showering of embolic material.
The echocardiogram showed a large 2-cm to 3-cm vegetation on his aortic valve, and a thickened mitral valve, and a question of an air abscess behind the aortic valve.
Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted, and the patient was seen by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4051**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who noted his history and that he had associated moderate aortic insufficiency with this vegetation on his aortic valve, left coronary leaflet.
He had a transesophageal echocardiogram done on [**12-28**] which showed excellent left ventricular systolic function and a large highly mobile and friable vegetation on the left aortic leaflet on left ventricular flow tract side.
Infectious Disease continued to follow him with recommendations as to the possible cause of his endocarditis.
Over the course of the next two weeks he was treated for his bacterial endocarditis by Infectious Disease and Cardiology with antibiotic therapy.
He continued with blood cultures and occasional temperature spikes.
His antibiotics were held, and he had mild renal insufficiency upon the recommendations of Infectious Disease.
He remained febrile with no neurologic complaints and continued to ambulate while he awaited surgery for his aortic valve endocarditis.
He had a left lung infiltrate on [**1-1**], so levofloxacin was added into the antibiotic regimen along with the ceftriaxone.
He continued to have both his systolic ejection murmur and his diastolic murmur, and was continued on antibiotics.
He continued with increased intravenous fluids therapy and hydration for the mild increase in his creatinine, and BUN decrease, and continued to remain febrile but was hemodynamically stable.
On [**1-10**] he was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells for his hematocrit, and he remained stable with no evidence of bleeding or hemolysis.
His left circumflex outflow track was repaired and reconstructed with a pericardial patch, and he had a repair of his mitral valve after debridement by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].
His abdomen was soft and nontender, and his extremities were warm.
On [**1-16**], the patient also had some aspiration and distress and combative behavior.
His chest x-ray showed pleural effusion and atelectasis.
He was confused and agitated during the morning and pulling his lines, so his intubation was done for better control and management of the airway and better pulmonary toilet.
A specimen was sent for culture.
He continued on Lopressor, amiodarone, and propofol as well as his double antibiotic therapy.
On postoperative day six, he was in and out of atrial fibrillation.
On postoperative day seven, he continued to be in and out of atrial fibrillation and remained on amiodarone as well as heparin drips with a good blood pressure.
He had some bigeminy on [**1-19**] while he was out on the floor.
for added coverage.
The patient was also seen by the Electrophysiology/Cardiology Service for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on postoperative day eight.
On postoperative day nine, he was a little bit confused overnight but more oriented in the morning with no complaints.
Drug adjustments were made again to get better control of his blood pressure.
He had a Psychiatry consultation on [**1-21**] for his periodic agitation and confusion.
He had some slight elevation in his pancreatic enzymes, and they recommended having Neurology see him to consider an alternative to the Depakote.
Their impression was that he had delirium and a possible pancreatitis with elevated lipase and amylase.
On postoperative day 10, he had no complaints.
He had one episode of nausea and vomiting also on [**1-22**].
On postoperative day 11, he had no complaints with a temperature maximum of 99.9.
He had another episode of emesis but still felt weak.
There was a question of whether or not the nausea and vomiting was produced by any of his new medications.
On postoperative day 12, he continued with some complaints of nausea and emesis times one.
He had some coarse breath sounds, but his lungs were otherwise clear.
His amylase was rechecked in preparation for his discharge, and he was discharged on [**1-26**] with instructions for follow-up appointments with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **], his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] also Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in three to four weeks.
Status post left temporal arachnoid cyst.
History of seizure disorder.
