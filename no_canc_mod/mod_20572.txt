The patient developed a CSF leak that was followed by Neurosurgery that eventually subsided.
Nuerosurgery also followed the patient for a questionable C4-C6 ligamentous injury for which he was put in a cervical collar.
Opthomology took the patient to the OR for Left globe exploration, they found no globe rupture but significant corneal abrasion, [**Doctor First Name 2281**] avulsion with intact lens, and retinal hemorrhages.
Patient steadily improved over stay, he developed some impulsiveness that slowly subsided, he was able to maintain POs, and achieve daily caloric intake by d/c, and was cleared by PT and OT for d/c to home with follow up.
2) Subarachnoid versus subdural blood along anterior falx just above crista galli.
3) Likely left frontal contusion.
4) Multiple comminuted facial bone fractures.
Please see the dedicated CT scan of the facial bones for more information.
Comminuted fractures involving the outer and inner tables of the frontal sinuses with pneumocephalus.
Comminuted fractures involving the orbits and maxillary sinuses bilaterally.
Comminuted fracture of the left zygoma.
Right mandibular fracture.
Significant subcutaneous emphysema involving the soft tissues of the scalp, the orbits and neck.
CTA head: IMPRESSION: 1) Slight decrease in prominence of subarachnoid hemorrhage anterior to the frontal lobes bilaterally, without evidence of new mass effect or new intracranial hemorrhage.
Stable pneumocephalus associated with multiple comminuted skull fractures.
2) Stable appearance of extensive facial fractures.
3) No evidence of aneurysm or occlusion of the vessels of the Circle of [**Location (un) 431**] and its tributaries, or of the cervical portions of the carotid and vertebral arteries.
Visualization of the small branches of the external carotid systems is limited, and if there is clinical interest for evaluation of these vessels, standard diagnostic angiography is recommended.
Follow recommendations of Occupational therapy.
