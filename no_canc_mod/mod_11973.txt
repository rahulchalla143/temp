The patient had an episode of bradycardia and in the recovery room an electrocardiogram was obtained and he was palced on telemetry and transferred to the VICU for continued monitoring and care.
Serial CK MB and troponin levels were obtained secondary to the patient's onset of atrial fibrillation and bradycardia.
Cardiology was requested to see the patient, because of his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and bradycardia.
He did have asymptomatic episode of ventricular tachycardia.
His initial dressing was removed and the wound edges were well approximated without ischemia.
Renal Service continued to follow the patient for his hemodialysis needs.
He had no further episodes of supraventricular tachycardia or bradycardia.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was compounded with acute renal failure on top of chronic renal failure.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Failed right graft ischemic leg status post right below the knee amputation.
Acute renal failure with underlying chronic renal failure on hemodialysis.
Atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation controlled.
