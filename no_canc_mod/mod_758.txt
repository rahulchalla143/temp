A colonoscopy was notable for stigmata of a recent internal hemorrhoid bleed with post radiation proctitis.
Then readmitted ([**4-5**] - [**4-11**]), this time with lower extremity edema thought to be secondary to a CHF exacerbation.
Over the last day he reports approximately 10 hours of dark black stools.
This has not been associated with any abdominal pains, nausea/vomiting, chest pains, shortness of breath, fevers/chills.

Congestive heart failure - Echo ([**3-19**]) with EF 40% (secondary to dyskinesis of the basal inferior and posterior (inferolateral) walls and mild LVH 3.
Mitral regurgitation (3+) 4.
