HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is an 88 year old male with a history of multi-infarct dementia, cerebrovascular accident, low grade lymphoma, upper gastrointestinal bleed, coronary artery disease status post non-Q wave myocardial infarction, chronic iron deficiency anemia and chronic renal insufficiency who presented with dark emesis as well as dark stools a couple of days prior to admission.
The patient noted some abdominal pain.
In the Emergency Department, he had tachycardia and hypertension with vital signs 88/63 with a pulse of 135.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy in the Medical Intensive Care Unit revealed mild gastritis and therefore Plavix was held.
Cerebrovascular accident with residual left upper extremity paresis.
History of multiple pulmonary embolisms status post IVC filter.
Low grade lymphoma.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy status post transurethral resection of prostate.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Coronary artery disease status post non-Q wave myocardial infarction.
Iron deficiency anemia.
Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.1.
The patient is well appearing male in no acute distress.
No murmurs or rubs noted.
Extremities with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema noted with two plus dorsalis pedis.
Urinalysis showed moderate leukocyte esterase with greater than 50 white blood cells, 15 red blood cells, few bacteria and 3 epithelial cells.
There is [**Street Address(2) 2914**] depression in V2 through V3 along with T wave inversions V1 through V5.
Compared to [**2145-7-23**] EKG, there is new downsloping of ST and T wave inversions in V2 through V5.
Chest x-ray showed no cardiopulmonary changes.
STUDIES:  [**2144-5-21**] echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of greater than 55%, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension.
His hematocrit was checked every eight hours and held steady around 30, however, when he ruled in for a myocardial infarction, he was given another unit of blood despite his hematocrit being only 29.8.
His non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin and Plavix were held until his ruled in for a myocardial infarction and that was safely restarted once his hematocrit had been holding steady.
The patient's stools remained guaiac positive throughout his hospital course.
The patient's issue was going to be prepped for colonoscopy but then it was decided that this would provide no further information, so that should be deferred for an outpatient basis.
Coronary artery disease with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction:  By the third day of admission, the patient started ruling in for a myocardial infarction with CKs peaking at 224 with CK MB at 11 and CK MB index of 4.9.
After the enzyme trended downward, cardiac enzymes were no longer checked.
There is persistent T wave inversions in V2 through V5.
The patient was sent for an echocardiogram given that he ruled in for myocardial infarction.
The echocardiogram revealed ejection fraction of 30% with anterior septal left ventricular hypokinesis.
Also noted was right ventricular apical hypokinesis, aortic root moderate dilation, two plus mitral regurgitation, two plus tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
The tricuspid regurgitation and depressed left ventricular function is new since the echocardiogram in [**2144-5-21**].
Given that there is left ventricular dysfunction, the patient was started on a low dose ACE inhibitor in the form of captopril 4.5 mg p.o.
Upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to gastritis.
Anteroseptal non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
