Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography  History of Present Illness: 59 year old woman with a history of cholecystectomy and prior biliary tract infection who originally presented to the [**Hospital 8**] Hospital ED on [**2157-5-6**] complaining of one day of abdominal pain.
Abdominal imaging showed a question of a mild ileus on KUB and mild intrahepatic ductal dilatation in the right lobe of the liver.
Urine culture was notable for GNR.
She reportedly became progressively more somnolent and hypotensive, prompting transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent ERCP on [**5-7**] due to concern for biliary sepsis.
Past Medical History: s/p cholecystectomy (unclear when surgery took place) rheumatoid arthritis (on prednisone) s/p tubal ligation and ?hysterectomy hx biliary tract infection (date/details unknown) with ERCP [**12-13**] [**Hospital3 **] H. pylori IgG positive   Social History: Per OSH records, no tobacco, EtOH, or illicit drugs; OSH records report that patient's ?aunt/?mother recently died; lives with her daughter.
Anicteric, no carotid bruits, MMM Lungs CTA B RRR S1S2 II/VI benign flow murmur ULSB Abd + [**Doctor Last Name 515**], obese, +BS, mild RUQ tenderness, soft, no rebound or guarding, no HSM on percussion Extr no c/c/e, 2+ B DP pulses   Pertinent Results: CT Abdomen from OSH ([**2157-5-7**]): Lung bases show bilateral moderate-sized infiltrates or atelectasis.
Definite dilatation of intrahepatic ducts involing right lobe of the liver.
Multiple low-density lesions are noted in both ovaries.
* CXR from OSH ([**2157-5-7**]): Bibasilar atelectasis and/or infiltrates  CXR [**5-9**]: Likely mild pulmonary edema with worsening bilateral pleural effusions.
* RUQ ultrasound from OSH ([**2157-5-7**]): Mild dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts in the right lobe of the liver.
[**2157-5-8**] CXR: Bilateral pleural effusions.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
[**2157-5-9**] CXR: Increase in bilateral pleural effusions since prior examination with pulmonary vascular congestion.
[**2157-5-7**] ERCP: Biliary dilation without obvious stones or strictures.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2157-5-9**]):    NO GROWTH.
She was electively intubated and ERCP was performed emergently, revealing moderate diffuse dilatation of the CBD.
However, no obstructing stone or purulent drainage was detected.
After ERCP she steadily improved, coming off pressors and extubated [**5-9**] with resolution of her hyperbilirubinemia, with a lag of recovery of her INR.
[**Last Name (un) **] stimulation was performed given history of steroid use for rheumatoid arthritis, which showed adrenal insufficiency.
Blood cx and urine cx from [**Hospital1 8**] came back + for E. Coli sensitive to cipro/aztreonam, allowing cipro monotherapy.
She has steadily improved on cipro in house, although had a brief episode of diarhea on [**5-11**] in the evening, which resolved on its own overnight.
Over [**5-11**] she was noted with marked hypokalemia, which has required multiple IV repletions, which is felt to be secondary to autodiuresis.

ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY - Secondary, due to chronic steroids - patient seems to be confused as to which steroids to take as an outpatient.
Hypokalemia - due to autodiuresis - resolved with repletion  5.
Ovarian lesions - incidental finding on outside hospital CT - Outpatient followup for pelvic ultrasound to complete evaluation  Medications on Admission: Amoxicillin 1000 [**Hospital1 **] x14 days Protonix 40 Daily x14 days Clarithromycin 500 [**Hospital1 **] Prednisone 7.5mg QHS Indomethacin 25/Metocarbamol 215/Betamethasone 0.75 (Mexican medication)  Discharge Medications: 1.
