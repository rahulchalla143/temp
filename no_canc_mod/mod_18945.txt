She was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2147-10-29**] with complaints of chest pain.
Pt reports CP never really resolved after last stent; unable to ambulate to bathroom without pain and SOB.
At OSHh she ruled in for a NSTEMI with a peak troponin of 0.95.
She underwent cardiac catheterization yesterday and was found to have a lesion in the SVG from the diag to the OM-1.
Last night at OSH s/p cath; pt has persistant chest pain.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for interventional cath.
PMH: Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Diabetes Anemia spinal stenosis Appendectomy tonsillectomy previous h/o quiac + stools none at present; had EGD and c-scope wnl .
Family History: Sister had MI at 82, brother with MI in 60s, mother died of MI at 72, dad with CAd died at 84.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
3/6 SEM mid-peaking, clearly heard S2, no radiation to carotids.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
No HSM or tenderness.
Groin: sheath in place on left, small hematoma on right, dressing c/d/i.
Selective venous conduit angiography demonstrated a diffusely diseased SVG graft to the obtuse marginal with a jump segment to the diagonal.
The graft also had a 90% lesion just proximal to the anastomosis site on the obtuse marginal along with a 70% lesion just proximal to the  anastomosis site on the diagonal.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated severe central hypertension (180/72 mm Hg).
Final angiography demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, 10% residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout (See PTCA comments).
Successful direct stenting of the distal SVG-OM graft with a Vision (4x12mm) bare metal stent.
Final angiography demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout (See PTCA comments).
Successful direct stenting of the SVG jump graft to the diagonal with a Vision (4x12mm) bare metal stent.
Final angiographyc demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, 20% residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout (See PTCA comments).
[**2147-11-4**] CXR: Worsening pulmonary edema.
There is a patchy opacity at the right lung base, which has diminished in size since the prior study.
There does not appear to be failure at this time.
Left groin subcutaneous hematoma, without evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Retained renal contrast is compatible with acute tubular necrosis.
CAD-Patient was initally admitted from OSH for interventional cath.
The graft also had a 90% lesion just proximal to the anastomosis site on the obtuse marginal along with a 70% lesion just proximal to the anastomosis site on the diagonal.
She underwent successful direct stenting of the SVG-OM-Diag with three bare metal stents which showed TIMI III flow after.
The patient had a brief episode of hypotension on hospital day #2 which resolved on its own.
An EKG was done which showed some deeper TWI in V2-V6.
A CT abdomen was done which did not show any evidence of RP Bleed.
On hospital day #3, the patient had a rapidly expanding hematoma which was evacuated by vascular surgery and an corrected pseudoaneurysm (see details below).
#.Systolic heart failure: Pt has CHF with EF 30%.
A an ECHO was done after her hematoma and hypotensive episode to make sure there was no evidence of pericardial effusion or new ischemia.
ECHO showed Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate global/regional systolic dysfunction.
Mild calcific aortic stenosis.
She did have an episode of bradycardia reported by surgeons which was thought to be a vagal episode (given concurrent report that SBPs were elevated).
There were no further episodes of bradycardia throughout the rest of her course.
4) Valve: Has a murmur on [**Month/Year (2) **] and ECHO notable for mild AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 1.2-1.9cm2).
No active issues during hospitaliztion.
#) HYPOTENSION/HYPERTENSION: Pt had episode of hypotension in the OR likely due to large volume of acute blood loss.
#) HEMATOMA: On post-cath check initially, pt found to have a small hematoma which intially resolved by holding pressure and her Hct was stable.
She was found to have a rapidly expanding hematoma in her left groin.
She underwent a left groin exploration, repair of the L CFA and placement of a JP drain.
She remained intubated due to instability of her VS with weaning of the vent.
#) ANEMIA: Pts Hct dropped secondary to her hematoma.
Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1) Sublingual prn chest pain as needed for pain.

You underwent a cardiac catheterization which showed some occlusion in the grafts done from your previous CABG.
YOu had some bleeding at the site in your left groin.
In addition, we added colesevelam for cholesterol.
