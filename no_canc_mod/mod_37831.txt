She was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization [**2126-3-13**] which revealed severe aortic stenosis and 2 vessel coronary artery disease with a 50-60% left main lesion.
She is admitted now for elective operation.
Past Medical History: aortic stenosis aortic insufficiency coronary artery disease hypertension hyperlipidemia h/o Non Hodgkins Lymphoma (s/p radiation therapy) gastroesophageal reflux s/p splenectomy s/p total abdominal hysterectomy osteopenia nonfunctioning left kidney hypothyroidism mild dementia   Social History: She is divorced ([**2110**]) and lives with her daughter, spending much time in FL.
No tobacco, rare social ETOH, no illicits.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is a well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position with good leaflet excursion.
There is no paravalvular and trace transvalvular regurgitation.
Biventricular systolic function is preserved.
All other findings are consistent with pre-bypass findings.
She weaned from bypass on no pressors and transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on a titrated Propofol drip.
She remained stable except for some non specific abdominal distension which resolved spontaneously.
Hematology/oncology saw her in consult and felt this was an acquired process without specific intervention  required.
Her CTs were left in for many days due to the high serous output, but eventually were able to be removed.
Follow up CXR demonstrated miniscule left pleural effusion with well expanded lungs.
She developed drainage from the proximal thigh wound of old bloody fluid which stopped and the wound remained clean.
Repeat  labs were subsequently drawn which revealed BUN and creatinine falling.
