[**2181-3-16**] TTE Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
There are filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant).
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate global systolic dysfunction.
Mild functional mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
[**2181-3-15**] NON-INVASIVE DUPLEX VENOUS STUDY OF THE RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY CLINICAL INDICATION: Morbid obesity and congestive heart failure with persistent right upper extremity edema.
The right internal jugular vein is markedly dilated, measuring up to 1.6 cm in diameter and showing some effects of slow blood flow with swirling and somewhat sludgy flow.
CONCLUSION: No evidence of DVT in the right upper extremity.
Note is made of a dilated and slow flowing internal jugular vein on the right side, possibly related to the patient's underlying congestive heart failure.
[**2181-3-2**] RENAL ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: Note is made that this is an extremely limited ultrasound due to the patient's body habitus.
No hydronephrosis is seen in the right kidney.
A small shadowing non-obstructing stone is seen within the right renal collecting system measuring 5 mm.
No hydronephrosis in the right kidney.
Small non-obstructing right renal stone.
No Doppler examination could be performed as the visualization is extremely limited due to the patient's body habitus.
Small amount of ascites seen in the pelvis .
[**2181-3-3**] CXR SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST REASON FOR EXAM: CHF, improved oxygen requirement after aggressive diuresis.
Morbid obesity.
There is mild vascular congestion.
There is a small left pleural effusion.
There is no pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 91333**] is a 60 year old female w/ history of severe systolic heart failure s/p CABG ([**2172**]), STEMI (vein graft occlusion, LAD/[**Year (4 digits) 11641**] stenting [**2174**]) stents to LAD and [**Year (4 digits) 11641**] ([**2174**]), AICD placement, presents after hypoxic minimally-responsive episode at rehab, found to be grossly volume overloaded due to underdiuresis, improved after aggressive diuresis with lasix drip augmented with hemodialysis.
# HX SYNCOPE AT REHAB When pt was initially evaluated in the ED and ICU, there was question about whether there was true syncope, especially since she was hypoxic.
AICD was interrogated w/o evidence of arrythmia.
# HYPOXIA ON ADMISSION Patient found to be hypoxic in ED to 88% on 4L NC.
Hypoxia thought to be due to ongoing volume overload and unresolved pulmonary edema, especially given her anarsarca, with some additional contribution from obesity hypoventilation and OSA.
No evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
For CHF management, see below.
Regarding etiology of likely worsening failure, concern was raised for chronic thromboembolic disease (SVC syndrome given syncopal episode and upper extremity edema, or chronic PE burden).
Troponins were stably elevated and peaked at 0.28, thought to be due to renal failure.
No V/Q scan pursued given high likelihood false positive due to body habitus, CTA not possible due to underlying renal disease.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE Most recent echocardiogram 2 weeks prior to admission showed stable systolic function (LVEF 35%).
Nonetheless, she was grossly volume overload on arrival to the cardiology service, after minimal response to torsemide in the ICU and on medicine.
Family meeting held w/patient and son on [**3-16**] to review pt's poor prognosis from a heart failure/renal failure perspective.
# ACUTE-ON-CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE Creatinine 1.4 on transfer, 2.0 on d/c date.
Worsening creatinine likely secondary to diuresis, but this was necessary given overwhelming volume overload.
Ultimately patient required temporary HD as recommended by renal consult when her lasix diuresis waned & she developed somnolence/confusion/decreased appetite (considered possible symptomatic uremia vs med effect, see above).
Dialysis discontinued after [**3-17**] when volume status and renal function improved.
She was briefly treated with acetazolamide for low bicarbonate but this improved with improved creatinine clearance and she no longer needed the acetazolamide.
# INTERMITTENT SOMNOLENCE & CONFUSION: TOXIC MEDICATION EFFECT Waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] MS [**First Name (Titles) 767**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5348**] AOX2 (name, hospital, not date) and increased somnolence from [**Date range (1) 86279**].
No e/o infection (blood cultures, urine cultures and CXR all clear).
Some suspicion for symptomatic uremia but BUN not particularly elevated.
# PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE (PVD), STABLE FOOT ULCERS Pt with chronic PVD s/p L BKA and R toe amputations and diabetic ulcers on R foot.
Patient had arterial non-invasive imaging during last hospitalization which demonstrated patent popliteal and PT arteries on the right with known moderate RLE occlusive disease.
# CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN Patient takes qHS GABAPENTIN chronically.
This was discontinued in the setting of altered mental status (transitioned to tylenol).
No complaints of back pain thereafter.
Tearful, frustrated, and occasionally verbally abusive to nursing staff at time of transfer from medicine to cardiology.
These symptoms resolved as a therapeutic relationship evolved.
These were dose-reduced when she later developed altered mental status.
# DIABETES MELLITUS, TYPE 2 Poorly controlled with complications, last A1c 7.6 (1/[**2180**]).
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES - needs follow-up appointment w/breast center, also for mammography and/or R breast ultrasound - needs psych/therapist after she gets to rehab - needs follow-up labs on [**2181-3-23**] and daily to check her potassium given multiple diuretics.
Also should check the creatinine given her acute on Chronic heart failure.
- needs close follow-up for diuresis, rehab shouldn't let her gain more than 3 lbs without calling cardiologist - may need to adjust doses of venlafaxine and buproprion once renal function improves, but recommend keeping gabapentin off given 2 admissions for "unresponsiveness" - still has PICC for blood draws given ongoing diuresis with 3 agents.
She should have this removed when her outpatient doctors think she [**Name5 (PTitle) **] not need frequent blood draws anymore or if it becomes painful or infected - she was not started on an ACE-inhibitor because her creatinine was still elevated on discharge to 2, this should be added in the future with nephrology input - Please check chemistry panel daily starting on [**2181-3-23**] and dose her potassium chloride daily to maintain a potassium greater than 3.5.
