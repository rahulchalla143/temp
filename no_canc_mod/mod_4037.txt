Ultimately, he developed an open wound at the level of the popliteal exposure, a graft infection with severe Staphylococcus bacteremia, and nearly died as result of multisystem organ failure of sepsis.
He subsequently recovered from that; but has still had a nonhealing wound in his groin, and a draining sinus at his popliteal space.
It was also very redundant, and there was a large inflammatory mass around it.
An arteriogram showed that his the below-knee popliteal artery was a suitable target with anterior tibial and posterior tibial runoff distally.

Of note, in [**Month (only) 404**] of this year the patient developed a staph infection of his R fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] graft that caused bacteremia and septic shock.
At this point his family reports that he still has residual osteomyelitis and is on suppressive doxycycline.
During his stay in the ICU he developed acute kidney injury but otherwise does not have any known history of kidney dysfunction.
After discharge he saw his PCP who according to patient's family (records not available at this time) stopped KCL and his multivitamin but kept his medications the same otherwise.

Patient also arrived hyperkalemic during the previous hospitalization on [**8-10**] and was treated appropriately but was discharged on his previous home medications which included spironolactone, losartan, carvedilol, and KCL.
- Agree with primary team's management of acute hyperkalemia including frequent K checks, telemetry, and IV lasix.
If patient's cardiologist feels that benefit for treatment of CHF outweighs risk, would restart losartan or spironolactone one at a time and at low dose with frequent electrolyte checks.
Would avoid TMP in the future if possible, but if a reasonable alternative is not available then would continue with close electrolyte monitoring.
TMP does not appear to have been the predominant cause of his hyperkalemia as he was not taking it during his [**8-10**] admission.
