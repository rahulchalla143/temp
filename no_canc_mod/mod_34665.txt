Admission Date:  [**2131-2-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2131-2-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2059-2-21**]             Sex:   F  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**] Chief Complaint: dysarthria, headache, right hemiparesis   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: was intubated at outside hospital   History of Present Illness: 71yo right handed woman with PMH significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia presents as a transfer from an outside hospital with left temporal ICH, initially presenting with dysarthria and headache, followed by right hemiparesis, and later obtundation s/p IV tPA.
There she was noted to have a right hemiparesis (?hemiplegia as told to the family).
She had an initial HCT showing no hemorrhage and was given IV tPA, around 2pm per her family.
Approximately one hour later she vomited, was given zoftan, and became "incoherent" with respiratory distress.
Repeat HCT showed a 12mm left temporal hemorrhage.
En route she was hypertensive and required labetolol 20mg.
Past Medical History: hypertension, prescribed medications but noncompliant until the day of presentation hyperlipidemia   Social History: longevity, no strokes, seizures, cancer  - Husband [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 78042**] (H), [**Telephone/Fax (1) 78043**] (C) - Son [**Name (NI) 3979**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 78044**]  code status: full per family   Family History: no tobacco, EtOH, drug use, extended family present (contact numbers in plan below)   Physical Exam: VS: T 97.8 at OSH; here HR 88, BP 175/79, RR 17, SaO2 100%/vent Genl: intubated, sedated HEENT: ETT in place Neck: no carotid bruits CV: RRR, nl S1, S2, no m/r/g Chest: CTAB Abd: soft, NTND, BS+ Ext: warm and dry GU: foley in place  Neurologic examination: MS: sedated, moves to stimuli, no eye opening, no response to voice CN: pupils small but reactive, 1.5->1 b/l, no significant movement in any direction on dolls eyes, +weak corneals b/l, +nasal tickle b/l, +gag Motor: moves all exts symmetrically to noxious [**Last Name (un) **]: moves to stimuli in all exts DTRs: trace in b/l [**Hospital1 **], br, pat, unable to elicit in tri, ach, toes mute b/l   Pertinent Results: Creat 1.2  BUN 24   HbA1C 5.9%  CRP 71.9   ESR 35  OSH: 142  102  28 ------------< 104 4.8  26  1.2 Ca [**32**].4 8.5 > 41.4 < 433 INR 0.9, PTT 25.6 U/A negative  HCT OSH at 1pm: "normal CT of the head" repeat HCT at OSH: "There is a small, approximately 12mm area of increased attenuation within the left temporal lobe.
This is consistent with acute hemorrhage.
There is no evidence of midline shift."
HCT here: appears unchanged  CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no change in the appearance of the brain from the comparison with redemonstration of a left temporal hemorrhage measuring approximately 13 mm, associated with surrounding edema.
A second area of low attenuation about the left subinsular white matter that could represent a subacute infarction is unchanged.
No new foci of hemorrhage are identified.
CTA CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]:  The carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are opacified normally without evidence for occlusion, stenosis, or aneurysm.
Particularly, near the focus of intraventricular hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe, there is no evidence for any abnormal plexus of vessels.
COMMENT:  Given acute hemorrhage which may mask an underlying lesion, a follow-up CTA/MRA may be helpful to exclude an underlying lesion after the acute hemorrhage has resolved if clinically indicated.
The left temporal hemorrhage is shown as an area of susceptibility and mild T2 hyperintensity.
There are no other definite areas of signal abnormality seen within the brain parenchyma.
There are no areas of pathological enhancement identified, including the left temporal region.
There is no sign for the presence of hemodynamically significant stenosis or other vascular abnormality in this locale.
CONCLUSION:  No definite areas of pathological enhancement that would correlate with the left temporal lobe hemorrhage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior and inferolateral walls.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild left ventricular regional dysfunction with borderline normal systolic funciton.
No ASD/PFO identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 71yo RHF with PMH significant for HTN and  presents with initial headache, dysarthria, then right hemiparesis at an OSH, with decreased responsiveness and head CT showing interval development of a small left temporal hemorrhage.
Her initial symptoms may have been secondary to seizure from a structure such as cavernous angioma that later bled from the tPA, or may have been due to infarct with later hemorrhagic conversion.
On [**2-5**] she was thought to have decreased responsiveness in the context of a low-grade fever, repeat HCT remained stable, was tx with one dose of Ceftriaxone empirically.
The MRI/A of her brain did not reveal any DWI changes of infarction, nor any blood vessel abnormalities in the area of the hemorrhage.
She clinically improved and was back to her baseline on the day of discharge, with normal neurological examination, only complaining of mild to moderate bifrontal headache.
Cardiac echo showed mild L ventricular regional dysfunction with borderline normal systolic function.
CTA did not reveal any evidence of feeding vessels or draining vein.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: small left temporal intracranial hemorrhage   Discharge Condition: neurologically intact   Discharge Instructions: You had a small amount of bleeding in your brain, likely precipitated by the TPA medicine you received when you presented initially with symptoms that were suspicious for stroke.
Please call your Primary Care Physician or present to the nearest Emergency Department if you have any worsening of your symptoms or new concerning symptoms such as severe headache, weakness, numbness, speech difficulties, visual changes, unsteady walking.
(your kidney function was mildly abnormal with Creatinine 1.2, BUN 24, and should be followed-up by your PCP; also it is important you maintain good blood pressure control as that can worsen bleeding into the brain).
