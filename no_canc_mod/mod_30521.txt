According to our records, the patient has a history of stable angina- chest pressure and dyspnea occurring with exertion, never rest, for which she underwent a stress MIBI in 09, which was negative for symptoms or ischemic EKG changes, but nuclear study revealed mild reversible inferior wall  defect.
EKG revealed Q waves in II, III and ST segment elevations in II, III, avF, V5, V6.
CXR had a small L-sided pleural effusion, but no evidence of PNA.
Became dyspneic and hypertensive- repeat EKG showed improvement in V5/V6 STE, but new TWI in V2/3.
Repeat CXR unchanged and without evidence of volume overload.
Of note, Pt presented to ED on [**2157-2-14**] c/o "not feeling well," was diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis (Vom/Diarrhea), and sent home with instructions for supportive care.
She denies any pain or dyspnea currently.
According to her family, she has possible orthopnea (sleeps upright in chair), dyspnea on exertion, and occasional chest pressure.
No recent fever or chills, cough or symptoms of infection.
Hypertension, previously intolerant to ACE/ARBs secondary to hyperkalemia and acute renal insufficiency per your records.
GERD, esophagitis with extensive esophageal diverticula, Dysphagia, only eating liquids/ice cream.
Partial hysterectomy.
Left radius fracture [**2142-10-9**] status post surgical ex-fix device/subsequent removal.
Family History: No Family Hx of CAD per son.
Physical Exam: ADMISSION PHYSICAL: VS: 96.7, 80, 119/91, 22, 97% on 4L GENERAL: elderly woman, no acute distress, oriented to self only HEENT: NCAT, sclera anicteric, dry mucous membranes NECK: Supple with unappreciable JVP CARDIAC: S1/S2, RRR, no murmurs approeciated LUNGS: no expiratory muscle use, bibasilar rales ABDOMEN: soft, non-tender, non-distended EXTREMITIES: + 2+ pitting edema up to mid calves b/l SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
STUDIES: CXR [**2157-2-27**]: IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of pulmonary edema.
Atelectasis and retrocardiac distribution is stable compared with prior with a possible small left pleural effusion.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferior septum, inferior and inferolateral segments.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent with inferior ischemia/infarction.
Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle, suggestive of RV ischemia/infarction.
At least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..   Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE: [**Age over 90 **] yo W with HX of CAD, HTN, HLD presenting with lethargy, found to have inferolateral ST segment elevations and elevated cardiac biomarkers, transferred to CCU for medical management of STEMI.
# ST SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION: The patient has a history of CAD.
Exercise MIBI in [**7-16**] was without symptoms or ischemic changes on EKG (performed 6 mins on mod [**Doctor Last Name 4001**]), but nuclear portion revealed a mild reversible inferior wall defect.
EKG on presentation revealed Q waves & ST segment elevations in Inferior/Lateral leads.
She was started on a nitro gtt for dyspnea and hypertension, which was weaned once her enzymes peaked.
# ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY: The patient had no echocardiogram prior to this admission.
Clinically she did not appear volume overloaded, with exception of mild lower extremity edema (per report) of chronic duration.
Post-infarct TTE demonstrated EF 30-35%, moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent with inferior ischemia/infarction in addition to dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle, suggestive of RV ischemia/infarction.
She initially had poor urine output, which improved with 250 cc boluses of IV hydration as necessary.
Given her RV involvement, and lack of heart failure symptoms, we did not diurese her or start a diuretic at discharge.
# RHYTHM: Monitored on telemetry and remained in sinus rhythm.
Likely pre-renal in etiology from mild hypovolemia.
On presentation she had a mild leukocytosis, which may have been related to her STEMI or her UTI.
# Anion-Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Unclear etiology.
Possible secondary to mildly elevated lacate on admission in setting of ischemia.
# GERD/Esophageal Diverticuli: Patient has a long history of dysphagia and prior episode of food impaction according to outpatient notes.
