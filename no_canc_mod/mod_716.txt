Admission Date: [**2196-3-5**]        Discharge Date: [**2196-4-20**]  Date of Birth:  [**2127-1-18**]        Sex:  M  Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]   CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fevers, chills, abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant, worsening shortness of breath x1 day, pleuritic like chest pain and nausea.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of polycystic kidney disease, status post cadaveric renal transplant in [**2190**], on Rapamune, prednisone and Gengraf.
The patient has a history of polycystic liver disease with recent cyst infections treated with IV antibiotics recently, presents with 2 week history of fevers up to 101, chills, malaise and shortness of breath with increasing abdominal distention and right upper quadrant pain.
The patient felt worse, however, and came to the emergency department for evaluation and workup.
The patient complained of malaise and shortness of breath but denied chest pain.
He denied any anorexia or urinary symptoms or new bowel changes.
He did complain of nausea and some dry heaves.
The patient has a history of polycystic kidney disease with also polycystic liver disease with multiple large liver cysts, one of which became infected secondarily with a pansensitive pseudomonas following episode of ERCP induced cholangitis and bacteremia in [**2195-8-20**].
At that time, he was initially treated with PIP/TAZO, followed by recurrence of fevers and persistence of the abscess.
He did well through [**2196-2-17**], when he had recurrent low fevers and malaise.
Repeat MRI showed enlargement of the left lateral liver abscess that was impinging on the diaphragm and pericardium.
He continued to have low grade fevers.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
A KUB and chest x-ray were done that demonstrated massive cardiomegaly and pericardial effusion.
He was mildly uncomfortable, appeared uncomfortable.
No scleral icterus.
Lungs were decreased on the left base with end expiratory crackles at base.
Abdomen moderately distended, tender over right upper quadrant.
He was tympanitic, no rebound, no guarding.
Extremities: Warm, no clubbing, cyanosis, 1+ edema, no calf tenderness.
He was found to have purulent pericarditis with pseudomonas, likely from translocation of bacteria from the abscess in the pericardium.
A pericardiocentesis was done and he was drained for approximately 2-3 liters of fluid and culture was positive for pansensitive pseudomonas and second gram negative organism was not identified.
Cipro was also added for double coverage while the sensitivities of the pseudomonas and the ID of the gram negative rods were pending.
The patient went to the operating room for a pericardial window and resection of the liver abscess on [**3-10**].
He remained in the surgical intensive care unit for a prolonged period of time during which time he received CVVHD for fluid overload.
He also experienced atrial fibrillation and required an amiodarone drip.
Repeat chest x-rays demonstrated no pneumothorax.
Repeat chest x-ray demonstrated right basilar atelectasis and left effusion.
He experienced a rise in his creatinine from a baseline of 2.2 up to a high of 4.
His amylase and lipase increased to a high of 652 for amylase and lipase of 1403 around postoperative day 17.
This was negative and an endoscopic ultrasound was done that showed no evidence of sludge or stones.
During this time, he experienced bouts of diarrhea and some abdominal discomfort.
His liver enzymes continued to remain elevated with an AST of 268, ALT of 112, alkaline phosphatase of 788, total bilirubin of 0.7, albumin of 2.2, his amylase and lipase trended down.
Vancomycin had been stopped previously given finalization of cultures which revealed pseudomonas pansensitive.
Vancomycin was also stopped at the time the patient was found to be VRE positive by rectal swab.
Abdominal CT on [**2196-3-22**], demonstrated no evidence of pancreatitis, multiple low attenuation lesions of the liver, many of which represented cysts, but could not exclude abscesses without IV contrast.
A pericardial and pleural effusion with subcutaneous stranding with free fluid was found to be consistent with anasarca.
New air pockets were noted with surrounding soft tissue density anterior to the bladder.
This was felt to be due to recent catheterization.
A liver ultrasound demonstrated no gallstones, no gallbladder wall thickening.
The patient remained in sinus rhythm and TTE demonstrated a moderate loculated pericardial effusion and no tamponade on [**2196-4-1**].
He also underwent a retroperitoneal ultrasound that demonstrated no evidence of biliary dilatation.
Also during this hospital course, he had a renal transplant duplex that demonstrated patent renal vasculature with no hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection.
He was treated with IV torsemide with mild response.
He demonstrated some upper extremity edema.
He did have a known right subclavian thrombus.
His left arm appeared edematous and it was noted that he had a left IJ central line in place.
On [**4-19**], he underwent an ultrasound of the left upper extremity that demonstrated no left upper limb deep venous thrombosis.
In summary, the patient is a 69-year-old male with complicated hospital course, status post pericardiocentesis and left segmentectomy, complicated by postoperative pancreatitis and renal insufficiency.
His lungs were diminished on the left lower lobe and bibasilar crackles.
Abdomen was soft, positive bowel sounds, abdominal incision had a small open area with a 2 x 2 normal saline dressing that was changed daily and that wound was healing.
Old J-P site was clean and dry as well as the old chest tube sites were well healed.
He continued with 3+ bilateral edema in his legs to his knees.
Polycystic liver disease.
Status post cadaveric renal transplant in [**2190**],     complicated by chronic renal insufficiency, pancreatitis,     atrial fibrillation, right internal jugular nonocclusive     thrombus, occlusive right subclavian thrombus.
Pseudomonas pericardial fluid infection treated with     Zosyn.
