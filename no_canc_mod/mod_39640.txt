Admission Date:  [**2130-1-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-3-15**]  Date of Birth:  [**2080-6-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Tegretol  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**] Chief Complaint: "fluid leaking from legs"  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: On the morning of [**2130-1-23**] (2 days PTA), Ms.[**Name (NI) 21862**] mother discovered that [**Known firstname 47168**] sheets were drenched with fluid from her legs and feet.
She noted that her socks were so sodden that "you could wring them out" and that there was some skin breakdown along her calves.
Her mother had noted increasing LE and full-body edema for the past 2-3 months, so much so that she had to buy her new pants in a larger size.
She has a history of LE brawny edema(L>R)and blanching erythema over the past 10 yrs, but never as severe or with leakage of fluid.
Her mother also noted that she began to develop a "pimply rash" along her left calf and that it seemed to be itchy.
Per her mother, she has not had any SOB, CP, or increased DOE.
Pt denies PND or orthopnea, but wears a Bipap machine at night for past 20 yrs.
Other symptoms include a dry cough that occasionally leads to post-tussive emesis, and some loose stools.
CXR showed possible atelectasis vs infiltrate.
ROS: No nausea, diarrhea, headaches, dizziness, positive for pain in R knee when walking.
Rheumatoid arthritis.
Osteoporosis with vertebral compression fractures - normal BMD at the femoral neck, osteopenia at the trochanter, and osteoporosis at the total hip ([**2129**]) 4.
SLE - dx [**2120**], diagnosis not documented well   Social History: Developmentally delayed, lives with mother and sister  Family History: NA  Physical Exam: T:96.8  BP: 126/68  P:  80 RR:  16 O2 sats: Gen: Pleasant woman, NAD HEENT: Malar rash EOMI, PERL, MMM, no tonsilar exudates CV: RRR, nl S1, S2, no M/R/G Resp: slight crackles bilaterally Abd: soft, slightly tense, tender to deep palpation in R and L UQ Ext: 4+ edema in both LE, red, erthymatous, non-indurated area covering L calf, some skin breakdown, oozing fluid.
Scaly in areas, with scattered pustules.
3+ edema in L arm (normal R).
Poorly defined nodules are likely secondary to bronchopneumonia.
However, along with several more well-defined nodules, the differential diagnosis includes fungal and Nocardia infection as well as metastatic disease.
Short-term followup CT after treatment for infection is recommended.
Peripheral and basilar honeycombing is consistent with interstitial fibrosis.
It demonstrates mild progression since the prior examinations six years earlier.
Mild hydrostatic pulmonary edema.
[**1-26**]: Films of hand: 3 VIEWS RIGHT HAND: There is moderate to severe degenerative disease of the right hand.
Juxta-articular osteopenia and moderate to severe joint space narrowing are seen within the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints.
Mild erosive changes are most prominent at the second proximal phalangeal joint.
Narrowing and partial ankylosis is seen within the carpal bones.
There is mild subluxation at the second and fifth MCP joint.
Hyperextension of the third and fifth proximal phalangeal joints with associated flexion of the distal phalangeal joints is consistent with "swan neck deformity."
There is mild erosion of the ulnar styloid process.
3 VIEWS LEFT HAND: There is moderate to severe degenerative disease of the left hand.
Juxta-articular osteopenia and moderate to severe joint space narrowing is seen within the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints.
Mild erosive changes are most prominent at the second, third, and fourth proximal interphalangeal joints.
Narrowing and partial ankylosis is seen within the carpal bones.
There is mild subluxation at the fifth MCP joint.
Hyperextension of the proximal phalangeal joints with associated flexion of the distal phalangeal joints is consistent with "swan neck deformity."
There is mild erosion of the ulnar styloid process.
FIndings consistent with rheumatoid arthritis.
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
Renal U/S RENAL ULTRASOUND: Study is limited due to patient's body habitus and difficulty complying with instructions.
There is no hydronephrosis or solid renal masses.
Echogenic kidneys, suggestive of underlying renal parenchymal disease.
[**1-26**] Echo: Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflet(3)appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for review)of [**2127-2-28**], a small pericardial effusion is now present.
Bilateral lower ext u/s: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity .
Non-specific lateral ST-T wave abnormalities.
Low precordial lead voltage.
Otherwise, no diagnostic interim change .
Bilateral small pleural effusions and diffuse pulmonary interstitial prominence likely indicating cardiac failure.
Left pericolic gutter fluid collection, likely due to recent extensive spinal surgery, however, superinfection of this collection cannot be excluded.
Slightly enlarged right abdominal rectus sheath hematoma.
Small right perinephric fluid collection in association with a right renal low density lesion; most likely common this represents a ruptured cyst, however, correlation with ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation.
Small left-sided abdominal wall high density fluid collection likely representing hemorrhage within a seroma.
Radiopaque gallstones without CT evidence of cholecystitis.
Right adrenal lesion concerning for metastatic deposit.
Interval spinal fusion from T10 to L4.
Small right perinephric fluid collection is noted as seen on the CT study of one day prior.
Superimposed infection cannot be excluded by imaging.
While there is persistent angulation at L1/2 with focal obliteration of the cerebrospinal fluid around the conus, the fluid collection in the laminectomy site may not necessarily exert pressure on the conus.
Abnormal signal within the conus may be related either to persistent compression, or to myelopathy resulting from presurgical compression.
[**2130-3-10**] TEE: No echo evidence of endocarditis.
Brief Hospital Course: 49 yo F with h/o developmental delay and rheumatoid arthritis admitted for anasarca, found to have nephrotic syndrome and has had a prolonged hospital course complicated by new LE weakness/numbness.
# Nephrotic syndrome: Secondary to biopsy proven Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.
However, per pathology, such glomerular findings, when secondary to obesity, typically do not produce the profound edema and proteinuria seen in this patient.
Electron microscopy showed global foot process effacement which further supports a primary process.
Her cholesterol was found to be elevated while her triglycerides were normal and she was started on a statin.
# Leukocytosis: Total WBC normalized, but did have a bandemia that maxed at 13% prior to her 2nd surgery and then resolved following debridement of her surgical wound.
Etiology of her early leukocytosis was explored in the setting of abdominal discomfort.
Although positive for cholelithiasis, RUQ U/S was negative for cholecystitis.
There was also some concern for abscess given recent surgery with abdominal approach and CT abdomen/pelvis showed no definitive abscess or evidence of such.
Despite no clear intraabdominal process causing leukocytosis, blood and urine cultures were positive for VRE on [**3-3**] as discussed below.
Her white blood cell count and differential should be monitored at rehab given her multiple sources of infection and treatment with linezolid.
# VRE bacteremia:  Blood and urine cultures from [**2130-3-3**] were positive for VRE.
Although her total WBC count normalized, she developed a bandemia of 13% which resolved after being taken to the OR for surgical wound debridement; surgical wound also grew VRE and MRSA.
She has remained afebrile on linezolid.
TTE and TEE both negative for vegetation.
Given there was no involvement of hardware on 2nd trip to the OR, ID has reccommended a 2 week course of linezolid to be completed on [**2130-3-24**].
# Lower extremity Weakness/Numbness: Most likely secondary to L1-L2 vertebral compression fracture.
# Surgical wound infection:  Following her surgery, her back wound was noted to have increased drainage and was malodorous.
Ortho spine took her back to the OR for surgical wound debridement.
Although infected wound, there was apparently no involvement of hardware.
Cultures were sent which revealed VRE and MRSA.
They have reccommended [**Hospital1 **] wet to dry dressing changes which should be continued at rehab.
When other medical issues improved, an oupatient f/u appointment can be scheduled with plastic surgery at ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2868**] to remove the bone spur which likely precipitated ulcer formation.
# Hypoalbunemia: Albumin ranged from 1.4-2.0 secondary to proteinuria in the setting of nephrotic syndrome and poor nutritional intake.
She was started on reglan for motility and megace for appetite stimulation.
# Elevated INR:  INR became elevated to 1.4.
This was thought most likely [**2-10**] to poor nutrition and vitamin K deficiency given its normalization with PO vitamin K. .
This was thought secondary to volume overload and CT chest demonstrated diffuse interstitial disease that could be [**2-10**] heart failure, but TTE revealed normal function.
# Elevated bicarb: Elevation occurred in the setting of diuresis with IV lasix so thought to represent a contraction alkalosis.
# MRSA Cellulitis: She had a recent history of MRSA cellulitis and given her known VRE as above, was continued on linezolid.
Left lower extremity swelling and erythema persists, but is improved.
# Osteoporosis: Most likely related to vitamin D deficiency with low vitamin 25 hydroxy D.  She has a history of several vertebral compression fractures, present since [**2116**].
It has been held, however, given concern for possible contribution to FSGS/nephrotic syndrome.
She will need to follow up with endocrine as an outpatient at her convenience for continued management of her osteoporosis and multiple medications for this problem.
# Rheumatoid arthritis: Per prior discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the patient has long standing interstitial lung disease and her joint disease is likely JRA.
Her pain remained well controlled with tylenol and dilaudid (used post operatively).
# Anemia: Previous baseline Hct appears to be in the low to mid 30s, more recently 24s-25s.
She did develop a hematoma s/p renal biopsy that subsequently remained stable.
# F/E/N: Speech & swallow evaluated her and cleared her for thin liquids and soft solids.
# Prophylaxis: SQ heparin was discontinued given the risk of worsening osteoporosis and she was continued on fondaparinux for prophylaxis.
