Atrial fibrillation was initially managed medically however he was intolerant to amiodarone, dronaderone, propafenone, and flecainade developing visual disturbances/nausea/fatigue.
On the day of admission, he underwent PVI and developed a large pericardial effusion and hypotension with SBP 80 he was transiently on phenylepherine.
He was transfered to the CCU with a pericardial drain in place, a left femoral venous sheath, and off pressors.
EKG showed NSR at 90, with no STE or STD.
He complained of mild sharp non-radiating chest pain worst at the site of the drain, made worse by inhalation.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: - Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension 2.
CARDIAC HISTORY: - CABG:  no - PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: - PACING/ICD: 3.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Atrial fibrillation Depression/anxiety S/p carpal tunnel release right side 2 years ago S/p Sinus surgery   Social History: - Tobacco history:  [**5-17**] daily, started smoking 3 years ago.
Family History: - No family history of cardiomyopathies or sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: CRABL, no rales, wheezes or rhonchi.
No femoral bruits.
Normal size and orientation of the pulmonary veins without MR evidence of anomalous pulmonary venous return or pulmonary vein stenosis.
The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta were normal and mildly enlarged, respectively.
The main pulmonary artery diameter index was mildly enlarged.
Mild atrial enlargement.
Conclusions There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
After repositioning of pericardial drainage catheter: no residual pericardial effusion.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No percardial effusion.
Mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved left ventricular function.
Mildly dilated right ventricle with preserved function.
Borderline pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  A 59 yoM with PMH Atrial fibrillation admitted for elective pulmonary vein isolation procedure complicated by hemopericardium.
# Hemopericardium: Following pulmonary vein isolation procedure, patient developed hypotension and was treated briefly with pressors.
Echo revealed pericardial effusion.
He complained of pain at the site of the drain and was treated with morphine with fair control of pain.
On HD2, the pericardial drain was discontinued and repeat ECHO showed no pericardial effusion.
The procedure was complicated by hemopericardium requiring drain placement.
# Chronic lower back pain.
Patient reports long standing lower back pain made worse by inactivity.
