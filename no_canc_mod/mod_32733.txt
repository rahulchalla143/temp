She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath, was initially admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3, but had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and delerium which resulted in transfer to the CCU.
The husband says she had not complainted of any chest pain, LH, shortness of breath prior to the fall.
no bowel or bladder incontinence.
On admission to OSH, patient had troponin I of 0.21 initially thought secondary to sinus tachycardia (HR 100s).
Her EKG did not show any ST elevation but did have T wave inversions inferolaterally that deepened throughout her admission.
She was diagnosed with a non-st elevation MI and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catherization.
At the OSH ICU, she developed atrial fibrillation with RVR and was treated with IV lopressor persistent RVR.
She had a CXR that showed mild diffuse interstitial edema suggestive of congestive heart failure with a normal sized heart.
A TTE showed LV dilation, apical, septal, inferior and anterior akinesis, mild MR, and PA pressure of 38mmHg with LVEF 20%.
Because NSTEMI and afib, hip surgery was deferred for now.
She had a 5second pauses x2 and was transferred to the CCU for further management of her cardiac issues.
On arrival to the CCU, she was a&o x2-3, complaining only of pain in her hip, [**8-8**].

L hip Xrays: reads pending  Brief Hospital Course: 1.
NSTEMI: Patient ruled in for NSTEMI with elevated troponin 1.99 at OSH and .27 here with diffuse t wave inversions on ECG and  EF  20% on OSH echo.
She was given aspirin 325, plavix 75, metoprolol IV as needed for HR as below and started on heparin IV for ACS and monitored on telemetry.
Repeat Echo showed mild left regional systolic dysfunction with distal anterior, septal and apical hypokinesis c/w CAD as well as mild mitral regurgitation.
Cardiac cath showed no focal occlusions and there was no intervention performed.
Etiology of ECG changes and elevated biomarkers thought to be NSTEMI with either autolysis of clot or ischemia related to spasm, or Takotsubo's related to stress associated with fall and hip fx.
Plavix was not continued due to no stenting.
Atrial Fibrillation: In am of admission had RVR as fast as 160s.
Left hip fracture: Patient had pinning of left hip yesterday, tolerated well.
Treating pain with acetaminophen, and occasional tramadol.
Regarding DVT prophylaxis, patient has a therapeutic INR on warfarin.
Further testing for thyroid antibodies is pending.
Patient did not appear hypervolemic and was not started on diuretics.
Her head CT weas negative and her mental status returned to baseline by later the following day.
Diarrhea: Patient had 7 brown watery stools during her final two days in the hospital.
This was guaiac negative x1, the patient had no fevers or leykocytosis, and no abdominal pain.
Left Hip Fracture 3.
Atrial Fibrillation 4.
For your heart, you likely had a small heart attack.
You had a cardiac catheterization performed and there was no significant heart disease found.
- Warfarin to thin the blood due to atrial fibrillation, an abnormal heart rhythm you had while in the hospital.
Please seek immediate medical attention if you develop worsened hip pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, back pain, light-headedness, dizziness, passing out, fevers, shaking chills, or night sweats.
