ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2176-11-8**]):    NO GROWTH.
CT head showed left parietal subdural hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Otherwise imaging negative for fractures or other trauma.
Was intubated and had repeat head CT which showed no change.
CT Head ([**10-26**]) repeated, showed new region R frontal hypodensity v. motion artifact with ?developing infarct.
Spine MRI with old T12 compression fracture and spinal stenosis.
Delirium/Dementia: She continued to have delerium/dementia which we believed was likely due to her known history of [**Last Name (un) **] body dementia with worsening cognitive decline chronically.
Other contributing factors were the subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhages seen on CT scan as well as pain from injuries sustained during fall.
Finally, infection was another likely source for her continued delirium.
We treated her pain with acetominophen, and the patient appeared pain free throughout her course on the medical floor.
We examined for sources of infection and found a UTI which we treated as well as treating for likely aspiration pneumonia with ceftriaxone.
SAH/SDH s/p fall: CT on arrival to the ED revealed SAH/SDH and repeat showed no progression of these hemorrhages.
Her neuro exam remained non-focal with baseline dementia and superimposed delirium throughout her stay.
Fever/UTI/?PNA: Throughout her course, she continued to have low grade temperatures with a max of 101.2.
CXR was unrevealing, but in the setting of increased sputum production and fevers, we treated for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
In spite of treatment for both of these infectious sources with ceftriaxone for 7 days, here mental status failed to improve and she continued with low grade temperatures.
Given very low grade temperatures, it was felt that the patient was not infected and that the most likely source was fevers from her SDH/SAH.
If patient has increased fevers in the future, we would recommend testing stool for c. diff given antibiotic regimen while in hospital.
GIB: On [**2176-11-4**] her stools were found to be guiac positive.
Given her history of a head injury, we maintained her SBP between 130-160 throughout her hospitalization with her home dose of univasc and IV metoprolol with IV hydralazine prn elevated blood pressures.
FEN:  Given her inability to eat and her depressed mental status, an NG tube was placed for feeding.
Because of this finding and desire by family to continue feeding, PEG tube was placed successfully by IR without complications on [**2176-11-7**].
SOCIAL/GOALS OF CARE: In the setting of her chronic and progressive dementia and recent increases in number of falls, along with her current presentation of continued delirium, the primary team along with her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
