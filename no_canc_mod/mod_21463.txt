states he was awaken from sleep at 0330 with severe substernal pain and pressure.
He had never experienced any symptoms like this before.
At [**Hospital1 **] an ECG showed 1-2mm ST-elevations in leads I, avL, V3-V5 with T-wave inversion and reciprocal changes in the inferior leads.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the anterior septum and anterior free wall, moderate hypokinesis of the lateral wall, and extensive apical hypokinesis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

was found to have 80% stenosis of D1 and 50% stenosis of LAD with an EF of 40%.

The patient's BP and HR remained elevated and the patient was given IV lopressor 5 mg times three.
On tele pt rhythm was found to be in and out of atrial tachycardia.
ECHO done on [**2187-7-3**] showed EF-30% with hypokinesis in the LV of the ant.
free wall, lateral wall and extensive apical hypokinesis.
Because of the severity of the left ventricular systolic dysfunction he was started on coumadin.
blood pressure remained slightly elevated and his lopressor was maxed out at 150mg TID and lisinopril increased to 10 mg qday.
continued to remain in atrial tachycardia greater then 80% of the time and was referred for follow-up after discharge.
