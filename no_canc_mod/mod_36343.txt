CHIEF COMPLAINT:  SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND CHEST PAIN.
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, polysubstance abuse, hepatitis C, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
The patient presents with the complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain.
He reports a dry cough for the past five days.
He denied fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
He states that his pain worsened with coughing and deep inspiration and occasionally radiates to his neck.
He states that he has been complaint with his medications.
He improved with intravenous fluids, but states that the shortness of breath persists.
Congestive heart failure.
The patient has dilated cardiomyopathy with EF of about 25%.
There was global left ventricular hypokinesis with prominent inferior akinesis.
Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine of 1.5 to 1.6.
Brother has diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies..
NECK:  Neck was supple, no JVD noted.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm, 3/6 systolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla; S1 and S2.
No rhonchi, no wheezing.
EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
No calf tenderness.
CHEST X-RAY:  Marked cardiomegaly and mild interstitial edema.
Left and right atrial enlargement.
Left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria.
S-T segment depression 2 mm in V6.
It was initially unclear whether the patient's shortness of breath and chest pain were due to congestive heart failure or a pulmonary process, such as PE or pneumonia.
The patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled to rule out myocardial infarction.
The patient did rule out for myocardial infarction.
Severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunctions.
Severe pulmonary hypertension that was partially reversed with IV dobutamine.
Resting hemodynamics upon entry showed severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures with a low cardiac index.
The patient has been noted to have some episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
PUMP:  As stated above, on the day of admission, it was unclear if the patient's shortness of breath and chest pain were due to CHF exacerbation or a pulmonary process such as PE or pneumonia, to investigate whether the shortness of breath was due to CHF.
On [**9-16**], the patient was transferred to the coronary care unit for placement of a pulmonary artery catheter to assess volume status.
Pulmonary catheter was not placed due to the patient's elevated INR.
Echocardiogram was done on [**9-18**], which disclosed dilatation of the left atrium and right atrium; left ventricular wall thickness was normal; left ventricular cavity was severely dilated; severe global left ventricular hypokinesis marked dilatation of the right ventricular cavity; severe 4+ MR; severe 4+ TR seen.
There was mild pulmonary artery systemic hypertension and significant pulmonic regurgitation.
There was no pericardial effusion.
Global akinesis of the left ventricular wall most predominant at the apex.
Dilated left and right ventricles.
He continued on the Natrecor and Milrinone was started due to the elevated PVR.
CARDIAC SURGERY:  The patient is currently undergone workup for possible cardiac transplant.
Initially, the patient was being evaluated for mitral valve replacement surgery due to the decreased ejection fraction and significant PVR.
The abdominal ultrasound done on [**10-2**], disclosed cholelithiasis, no ascites or liver masses, no abdominal aortic aneurysm seen in the visualized portions of the aorta.
Doppler evaluation of the lower extremities shows triphasic w waveforms involving bilateral lower extremities.
Carotid elevation shows a widely patent left ICA without appreciable left carotid plaque.
The patient underwent a liver biopsy on [**10-4**] to rule out fibrosis or cirrhosis.
PULMONARY:  As stated above, on admission, it was unclear if the patient's shortness of breath was due to CHF or pulmonary process.
Differential included PE, atypical pneumonia, hepatopulmonary syndrome, sarcoidosis, possibly side effect of ACE inhibitors.
The patient was started on Levaquin for empiric treatment of atypical pneumonia.
CT angiogram was done on [**9-18**], which disclosed bilateral ground-glass opacities with focal patchy consolidation, believed to be consistent with CHF.
It was believed that the patient's acute and chronic renal failure was due to a combination of factors, such as decrease of the circulating volume due to CHF, as well as dye-induced ATN.
Renal consultation was placed on [**9-20**].
GASTROINTESTINAL:  Initially, the patient had a transaminitis and this has been attributed to hepatic congestion due to his CHF.
The patient underwent a liver biopsy on [**9-24**] to rule out fibrosis and cirrhosis.
Liver biopsy was necessary as part of the cardiac transplantation workup.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Numerous infectious disease tests were sent off as part of the workup for the patient's cardiac transplant.
PSYCHIATRIC:  The patient has been followed by the Addiction Services due to the history of polysubstance abuse.
ENDOCRINE:  Thyroid function studies were sent off as part of the patient's cardiac transplantation workup.
Congestive heart failure.
