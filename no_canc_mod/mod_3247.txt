The pain was at 5pm yesterday, was dull in nature, associated with dyspnea and lasted about 4 hours.
EKG showed ST depressions in precordial leads, Trop I 2.62, CK-MB 15.2.
Developed increasing SOB overnight thought to be from worsening CHF, for which he was given 80mg IV lasix and intubated.

Cx and RCA with no obstructive CAD.
-[**2155-8-27**] persantine ETT: no perfusion defects.
-[**2156-11-2**] echo: EF 60%,1+ AI, 1+ MR, mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Small pericardial effusion noted without  evidence of tamponade.

GENERAL: Intubated, but alert and following basic commands, pupils pinpoint and minimally reactive.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No appreciable murmurs, but difficult with balloon pump in place.
LUNGS: Rhonchorus centrally, no crackles anteriorly.
Cool extremities SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %) with severe hypokinesis of the mid to distal inferolateral and anterolateral walls.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**2-12**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Regional left ventricular dysfunction c/w CAD.
Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
Mild aortic stenosis.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild pulmonary hypertension.
The severity of aortic regurgitation has increased.
Mild aortic stenosis is seen.
No pericardial effusion is present.
[**1-7**] PCXR: The right upper lobe opacity is grossly unchanged since [**1-5**] radiograph with some additional minimal improvement at the right upper medial portion of the lungs, but overall there is significant improvement since [**12-28**] in the widespread consolidations.
The right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC.
No interval increase in pleural effusion or development of pneumothorax is present.
M with CAD (s/p 2 stents to LAD and 1 stent to RCA), HTN, HLD, DM2 who was admitted to OSH for chest pain found to have prox LAD occlusion s/p [**Hospital 19333**] hospital course complicated with respiratory distress s/p intubation and IABP to maintain pressures, transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
# Shock: Patient likely had cardiogenic shock in setting of LAD ischemic event.
Presumably developed cardiogenic shock, other possibility could be distributive shock due to sedation.
Pt had A. Fib which decreased his BP.
He was cardioverted 4 times with no success.
# Acute Systolic congestive Heart Failure: EF 40%: Developed respiratory failure requiring intubation.
Extubated on [**12-29**] without complication.
# STEMI: Presented with ST elevation in aVR and 99% prox LAD occlusion, LCx w/ old occlusion and left to left collaterals.
CAD was medically managed with atorvastatin 80mg, changed to simvastatin after concern for atorva contributed to rhabdo in past, aspirin 325mg, plavix 75mg.
had brief episodes of CP without ECG changes during admission, and enzymes never bumped up again.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Found to be in atrial fibrillation which made him hypotensive.
Cardioversion was attempted 4 times with no success.
He remained in SR during most of admission with occasional reversions into AFib.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Likely pre-renal from poor perfusion in the setting of shock.
The patient continued to have worsening BUN/Cr, along with symptoms of nausea.
# Urinary retention: The patient had a Foley placed at admission.
# Hyperkalemia: Likely from renal failure and lactic acidosis.
Insulin given as part of diabetes management, and potassium normalized.
No further episodes during admission.
has baseline anemia likely [**3-15**] CKD.

You also had an irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.
You were started on coumadin to prevent strokes that sometimes are caused by atrial fibrillation.
You also had trouble urinating after the foley catheter was removed.
You will need to have your thyroid, liver and lung function checked regularly on this medicine.
