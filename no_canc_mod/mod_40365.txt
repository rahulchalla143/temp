Admission Date:  [**2144-12-30**]              Discharge Date:   [**2145-1-21**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**] Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty Placement of a bare metal stent in the saphenous vein graft  History of Present Illness: This is an 86 yo male with a history of CAD (s/p CABG), chronic Afib, CHF, critical AS who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for aortic valvular repair.
In early [**Month (only) 404**], he was at [**Hospital6 **] for an acute CHF exacerbation, where he ruled in for an MI by enzymes.
At [**Hospital1 **] on [**2144-12-28**], he underwent catheterization which showed 85% stenosis of his SVG-OM1, but a patent LIMA-LAD.
In preparation for surgery, he was being followed by nephrology for chronic kidney disease.
He was also being followed by Heme-onc for chronically elevated INR, which was felt to be secondary to chronic warfarin use.
On the morning of admission, he became tachypneic, the rate of his AFib increased and he developed substernal chest pain.
He reported improved SOB and CP after converting.
Past Medical History: CAD - MI & CABG [**2127**] CHF -- systolic dysfunction (EF 35 - 40%) Chronic Afib critical AS NSVT s/p AICD [**1-28**] HTN DM LBBB CRI TIA & CVA  Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Gen: WDWN elderly male with obvious respiratory distress with some difficulty speaking.
Sclera anicteric.
Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
IMAGING: [**2144-12-30**] Admission CXR-- PA & Lateral Mild atelectasis at the left lung base with moderate cardiomegaly .
Critical aortic stenosis.
Successful stenting of the SVG-OM/PDA with a bare metal stent.
Successful aortic valvuloplasty.
Brief Hospital Course: AORTIC STENOSIS On admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 94178**] EF was ~35-40% with moderate mitral regurgitation and critical aortic stenosis (valve area of 0.6 and mean gradient of 58).
Surgical aortic valve replacement was deferred on this admission because of the patient's worsening renal function and multiple comorbidities, placing him at high risk for complications with an open heart surgery.
A percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty was performed on [**2145-1-15**] without complication.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION He has known chronic atrial fibrillation, with a baseline LBBB.
Upon arrival to the CCU, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was found to be in AFib with a rapid ventricular rate, which induced hypoxia and chest pain.
After intravenous furosemide and metoprolol, the patient quickly returned to his baseline rhythm of atrial fibrillation with a rate in the 70's, and his shortness of breath and chest pain improved.
A chest X ray showed pulmonary edema, which slowly improved over the hospital course with continued diruesis.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a CABG in [**2127**] with SVG to the OM1 and LIMA to the LAD.
His cath on [**2145-1-15**] showed patent LAD and 85% stenosis of the SVG; thus, a bare metal stent was placed in the SVG to OM1.
HYPERTENSION He was continued on metoprolol succinate and amlodipine with good control of his blood pressure.
ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE Although his baseline Cr is unknown, his Cr was 3.2 on admission, elevated from the 2.2 - 2.4 that he was running at the outside hospital prior to transfer.
The aucte on CKD was likely secondary to contrast nephropathy and a pre-renal state.
The renal service was consulted and felt there was no indication for acute dialysis.
URINARY TRACT INFECTION Mr. [**Known lastname **] was found to have Klebsiella in is urine cultures from [**2143-12-31**], which was treated with cirpofloxacin.
Repeat urine culture on [**2145-1-13**] grew Klebsiella and Enterococcus; he was again treated with ciprofloxacin (shown to be sensitive on culture).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 1293**] - [**Location (un) 1294**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Aortic Stenosis, s/p percutaneous valvuloplasty Systolic congestive heart failure Atrial fibrillation Acute on chronic renal failure Urinary tract infection  Secondary Diagnoses: Hypertension Diabetes Coronary Artery Disease   Discharge Condition: Stable-- patient less short of breath than on admission; still with some fatigue but also improved.
You should call your primary care doctor if you develop fever, pain with urination, worsening shortness of breath, or fluid retention.
