No evidence of acute fracture.
Extensive degenerative changes in the cervical spine, worse from C2 through C7 levels, with multilevel moderate spinal canal stenosis and neural foraminal narrowing.
A 2.3 cm calcified right thyroid lobe nodule.
----------- NCHCT: No evidence of hemorrhage or recent infarction.
Old right parietal and frontal infarctions.
Severe involutional changes.
No acute traumatic injury identified in the chest, abdomen and pelvis.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease of the thoracoabdominal aorta, with ectasia of the infrarenal aorta measuring 2.7 cm.
High-grade stenosis at the right renal artery origin.
Extensive coronary arterial calcification.
A 4 mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule.
Mild small airways wall thickening especially in the left lower lobe, suggestive of bronchitis.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= XX %).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild biventricular dilation with mild biventricular global hypokinesis.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-4-27**], the severity of tricuspid regurgitation has increased.
Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are slightly higher.
The right ventricle was probably mildly dilated with borderline systolic function on the prior echo also.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan:  Mr. [**Known lastname 13639**] is 87M with history of dementia, diastolic CHF (EF%60), HTN who presented s/p fall found to have elevated white count and lactate in the ED, as well as some hypotension who was started on Levophed.
# Hypotension: The patient was found to be hypotensive in the ED in the settting of elevated lactate and white count.
He had been afebrile, as per report, with no clear evidence of source of infection.
CXR negative for any acute pulmonary process, UA negative for nitrite/leuks; cultures NGTD at discharge.
Lactate initially elevated to 5.8 with acute rise in creatinine as below.
He was started on levoquin out of concern for possible respiratory process seen on CT chest, but this was stopped after further review.
LENIs were performed for evalaution of possible pulmonary embolism causing his symptoms and were negative.
All of the patient's lab abnormalities corrected with IV fluid arguing for hypovolemia rather than sepsis as no source of infection could be identified.
# Acute renal failure: The patient had a baseline creat of 0.9; 1.7 on presentation.
# Troponin leak with atrial flutter and RVR: The patient was noted to have troponin of 0.07; baseline 0.02.
The patient has previously refused treatment of his tachy-brady syndrome, so no changes were made to his medications.
He had no further issues during this hospitalization.
# Elevated CK:  likely from small amount of rhabdo due to fall.
# Diastolic CHF:  no evidence of acute failure despite 4 L of fluid resusitation.
# Other: A calcified thyroid nodule was seen on his CT spine, and may require outpatient follow-up.
Calcitriol 0.25 mcg PO 1X/WEEK (MO)   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Dehydration leading to a fall Dementia Diastolic heart failure, ejection fraction 60% Atrial flutter Hypertension Anemia not otherwise specified  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after a serious fall at home, and were found to have low blood pressure, fast heart rate and dehydration.
You were given intravenous fluids, and these problems resolved.
You are at risk for future falls and as a result need home nursing, home physical therapy and a home safety evaluation.
