The pain was very difficult to describe, not sharp or dull per se, she thought it was her arthritis.
Lasted about 10 minutes and spontaneously resolved without interventions.
Then this morning she had another episode of similar left shoulder pain this am, lasting a little longer, maybe about 1-2 hours.
She denies having shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis with these episodes.
With the pain this am she had a second of lightheadedness and that is why she decided to come in to the hospital for it.
Labs and imaging significant for troponin of 0.25 with normal renal function and EKG with ST elevations in aVR and lead III > II as well as depressions in I, II, V4-V6.
Otherwise NA/NI, rate 80s, + LVH and LAE.
Occluded OM off a tortuous circ.
On arrival to the floor, patient is feeling well, no more pain in the left shoulder.
She does report history of caludication symptoms in the past and some chronic shortness of breath, not exertional.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She reports exertional calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations.
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: - Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, - Hypertension 2.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: peripheral vascular disease s/p right fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass [**2111**] s/p L CEA [**2111**] arthritis bladder incontinence--?
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits in left groin, dressing c/d/i.
SKIN: + stasis dermatitis, no ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
IMAGING: [**2122-5-25**] CARDIAC CATH: 1) Selective angiography of this right-dominant system demonstrated significant three-vessel coronary artery disease.
The RCA was known to have a 100% mid-vessel stenosis and filled via left-to-right collaterals.
2) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial normotension, with a central aortic pressure of 132/67 mmHg.
3) Successful PTCA of the LCx with a 2.5 mm balloon (see PTCA comments).
4) Successful PTCA and stenting of the LCx into a major obtuse marginal branch with a 3.0 x 30 mm Resolute [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7930**] to 3.25 mm (see PTCA comments).
Successful PCI of the LCx into a large obtuse marginal branch with a 3.0 x 30 mm Resolute [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7930**] to 3.25 mm.
[**5-26**] tte: LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
Moderately depressed LVEF.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.
Borderline PA systolic hypertension.
Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA  PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls.
with depressed free wall contractility.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 11154**] is a 84 year old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with left shoulder pain, found to have ST elevations in aVR and ST depressions diffusely, with troponin elevations.
# CAD:  Has 3 vessel disease (3VD) on cath this admission, with DES placed to Lcx on [**2122-5-25**].
Also known 100% occlusion of RCA, LAD with 60-70% mid-vessel disease but patent proximal DES (from [**2111**]).
Post-cath her EKG showed resolution of her ST changes and her CKMB peaked at 153.
Her echo showed new EF 35% with inferior hypokinesis.
# New systolic heart failure:  Had decreased EF to 35% after her MI and crackles on exam.
She should be set up with heart failure clinic.
[**Month (only) 116**] also have a contribution from chronic constipation.
