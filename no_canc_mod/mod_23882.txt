According to the patient, he has nausea last night, which continued until this morning.
He also had a bifrontal throbbing headache, which continues to be present.
He had a difficult time sleeping due to stomach pain and was dry heaving all night.
HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa Neck: No tenderness to palpation, supple, no carotid or vertebral bruit CV: RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no murmurs/gallops/rubs Lung: Clear to auscultation bilaterally aBd: +BS soft, nontender ext: no edema  Neurologic examination: Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, but can only seem to follow one step commands, flat affect.
No evidence of apraxia or neglect.
No graphesthesia.
Extraocular movements intact bilaterally, no nystagmus.
Palate elevation symmetrical.

A 2-cm left posterior temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with small likely-subdural hematoma along the left hemispheric convexity.
Partial effacement of the left lateral ventricle, without significant shift from normally midline structures.
Longitudinal nondisplaced right temporal bone fracture.
x-ray finger [**2199-2-12**] IMPRESSION: Right third PIP joint dislocation without acute fracture.
CXR [**2199-2-12**] IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
No significant interval change in appearance of the multi compartment hemorrhage, with largest component centered within the left temporal lobe.
There is mild associated mass effect and the appearance is suggestive of post-traumatic hemorrhage without a definite underlying lesion.
Consideration could be given to a followup MRI once the blood products continue to resolve given the possible subtle nodular enhancement as detailed above.
Small right mastoid air cell effusion which when correlated with the preceding CT scan is associated with an oblique longitudinal right temporal bone fracture.
Unchanged density and size of the left temporal lobe hemorrhage with slightly increased peri-hemorrhagic edema.
Unchanged minimal impending left uncal herniation without compression of the brainstem.
Unchanged subdural hematoma over the left convexity.
No evidence of arteriovenous malformation (AVM), aneurysm or other abnormalities on the CTA study.
Unchanged nondisplaced fracture of the right mastoid air cells and squamous portion of the temporal bone.
No significant change in left temporal parenchymal hemorrhage and left convexity subdural hemorrhage, the former of which demonstrates surrounding edema.
Persistent mild uncal herniation on the left.
No new site of hemorrhage or evidence of hydrocephalus or developing infarction.
No significant interval change in the left temporal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with surrounding edema.
Unchanged small subdural hematoma overlying the left cerebral convexity.
According to the patient, he has nausea last night, which continued until this morning.
He also had a bifrontal throbbing headache, which continues to be present.
It was hypothesized he may have had a seizure resulting in mild trauma and possible contra-coup injury (right frontal trauma with left posterior temporal contusion).
Other possibilities included arteriovenous malformation or underlying mass.
His systolic blood pressure was maintained between 100-140 without intervention.
A repeat CT head showed a stable intraparenchymal and small subdural hematoma.
MRI brain showed no evidence of underlying mass.
A CTA showed no sign of vascular malformation.
The patient will undergo repeat MRI brain with and without contrast in [**4-23**] weeks for further evaluation of his hemorrhage.
A repeat head CT on [**2-16**] showed no change in the intraparenchymal or subdural bleeds.
He did not have any seizure activity while in house.
MSK; The patient was found to have a dislocation of his right middle finger which was subsequently reduced.
This was splinted and did not cause him significant pain .
He tolerated a regular diet without issues, he made adequate urine and did not have any desaturations.
On HD 5 the patient felt well and a repeat head CT showed no evolving process.
At the time of discharge he was ambulating without assistance, tolerating a regular diet but did have some persistent confusion.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for fever and headache.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every 4-6 hours as needed for pain for 5 days.
Disp:*15 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Intraparenchymal hemorrhage Secondary: Seizure   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted after being found unresponsive.
You were found to have a left temporal hemorrhage.
It was also suspected that you had a seizure, for which you were started on Keppra.
Because you had an episode of loss of consciousness, it is important that you not drive until you are seizure free for at least 6 months.
Medication changes: -Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **]  If you notice any of the concerning symptoms listed below, please call your PCP or return to the emergency department for further evaluation.
You can then discuss what type of tests this provider would like to order.
