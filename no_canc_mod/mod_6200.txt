Prior to his initial admission, pt had been having viral URI symptoms.
Despite the fact that some of his medical records mention possbily passing out at the wheel, on our careful history he clearly denies this and states that he remembers the entire accident, suffered no LOC, and was in fact directing traffic following the accident.

lung mass, resp failure REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess for PE, nature of lung mass CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
No prior studies are available for comparison.
CT CHEST BEFORE AND AFTER IV CONTRAST: There is atelectasis of both lower lobes.
A single enlarged hilar lymph node is seen on the left measuring 14 x 19 mm.
There is an NG tube coursing below the diaphragm; the patient is intubated into the right mainstem bronchus.
CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE CHEST: There is no pericardial effusion.
No pulmonary embolism is identified.
The aorta is normal in caliber, without evidence of dissection.
Bone windows show no suspicious sclerotic or lytic lesions.
Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation.
Bilateral small pleural effusions, right greater than left.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or definite pulmonary mass.
ECHO Study Date of [**2112-2-23**] MEASUREMENTS: Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 70% (nl >=55%) TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): 21 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg) INTERPRETATION: Findings: RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD or PFO by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Contrast study was performed with 3 iv injections of 8 ccs of agitated normal saline, at rest, with cough and post-Valsalva maneuver.
Conclusions: No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.

DIRECT INFLUENZA A ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2112-2-15**]):       Negative for Influenza A viral antigen.

Brief Hospital Course: 55 y/o man transferred to this hospital for hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure.
CTA demonstrated no pulmonary embolus and showed small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis vs. consolidation.
However he remained afebrile without leukocytosis.
He was diuresed due to concern for possible heart failure; however,  Bedside transthoracic echo showed a preserved LV systolic function.
Repeat Echo was performed with bubble study and this showed no evidence of shunt.
He reported no history of sleep apnea and stated his girlfriend has never noted symptoms either.
There was also a question of delirium associated with hypercarbia, however there was no clear trend between his CO2 levels and his mental status.
His episodes of confusion and agitation improved off benzo's and his CO2 was better controlled on nightly bipap settings at 12/6.
Given his persistent hypoxia and hypercarbia, a pulmonary consult was obtained.
