Thursday morning with some left sided chest pressure and sharp pain in left axilla, had had a huge argument with his wife the night prior and attributed this to his stress as he was still very angry with her.
While flying to [**Location (un) 86**] awoke from sleep and noticed some left arm numbness.
He also started to have some general malaise at the same time.
Seen by neuro who felt not having acute CVA and since on statin and ASA no change in management at this time.
CTA showed type A dissection, but surgical service felt no need for surgical intervention.
He was set to be discharged, but Cardiac surgery was concerned about Renal lesions and did not feel comfortable sending home so transferring to medicine for further work up of renal lesions.
Does not want to miss his whole vacation because it is the first time his whole family has been together in a while.

No definite acute intracranail process.
Hypodensity in the pons on the left may represent infarct, age indeterminate, or artifact.
Sinus disease as detailed above.
[**4-23**] Echo: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Correlation with the patient's surgical history is recommended to determine whether this is an acute on chronic vs chronic presentation.
Intermediate density right renal lesion in the left lower pole with some heterogeneity is concerning for a renal neoplasm and correlation with prior imaging if available is recommended and if not, further assessment can be performed with ultrasound.
Endoluminal material in the left main stem bronchus could reflect secretions or focal lesion.
Brief Hospital Course: 66 yo gentleman with pmhx type A dissection repaired 6 months ago presents with hypertension in setting of argument with wife and missing a dose of hydralazine.
CTA revealed incidental renal lesion concerning for neoplasm.
ASSESSMENT & PLAN:  # Renal Lesions: Patient has multiple hypodense renal lesions that were reportedly not noted on imaging during his admission in late [**2149**].
Patient could have neuroendocrine tumor secreting renin resulting in refractory hypertension, but this would likely result in persistent resistent hypertension over a period of time and this patient had an acute episode as he measures his BP daily and his SBP is always between 140-150s.
There was some concern for pheochromocytoma, but the concerning lesion is in the left lower pole of the kidney and not within the adrenal gland making this diagnosis less likely.
Patient could have RCC and would need to be worked up further with a biopsy.
# HTN: Patient BP is well controlled after administration IV hydral to acutely lower his BP and then doubling his Irbesartan and HCTZ.
BP most likely elevated in setting of fight with wife and missing medications.
Pt has no evidence of Renal artery stenosis on imaging here or at OSH in [**State 2690**].
He is without adrenal lesions making pheochromocytoma, or primary aldosteronism less likely.
Nor does he have any hypernatremia or hypokalemia one would see with increased aldosterone levels.
He had no femoral-radial pulse dissociation.
# Allergic sinusitis: Patient with symptoms since arriving to [**Location (un) 86**].
# Hyperlipidemia:  Continue statin  # Phrenic nerve injury after aortic surgery w/hoarse voice and requiring use of CPAP intermittently during day and while lying down: Continued on home meds  # Old CVA: Continue statin and aspirin  TRANSITIONAL: Follow up on renal lesion in [**Location (un) 11270**], Tx Monitor blood pressure control MRSA screen results pending  Medications on Admission: -Hydralazine 100 mg tid -Metoprolol ER 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] -Avapro 150 mg daily -Lipitor 10 mg daily -Advair 250-50 inh [**Hospital1 **] -ASA 243 mg daily (3 tabs of 81 mg) -Fish Oil -HCTZ 12.5 mg daily -Lecithin 1200 mg daily  Discharge Medications: 1. hydralazine 100 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO three times a day.
An incidental finding of a renal mass was made.
Please also request follow up with a neurologist for symptoms of arm numbness.
