Minimal increase in shift of midline structures to the right.
Stable small right subdural collection.
Large acute infarct involving almost the entire right middle cerebral arterial distribution.
Abrupt loss of signal within the mid portion of the right M1 segment.
This is either due to embolic occlusion or thrombosis.
Mild rightward subfalcine herniation, unchanged since earlier head CT.  CTA OF THE CHEST W/CONTRAST AND RECONS;[**2140-11-11**] 1) Acute pulmonary embolus in the segmental branches to the right middle and right upper lobe.

[**Last Name (un) **] DUP EXTEXT BIL (MAP/DVT)  [**2140-11-13**] No DVT .
No pneumothorax.
There is persistent opacity at the left base consistent with atelectasis/consolidation in the left lower lobe.
Cannot rule out associated small left pleural effusion.
CT of head [**2140-11-21**]: CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: No new intracranial hemorrhage is identified.
Increased conspicuity of both right and left subdural hemorrhages from interval increased hypodensity of these collections is noted, without appreciable change in size.
Large right middle cerebral artery distribution infarction with preservation of cortical density (presumably from leptomeningeal vascular collateralization) is not significantly changed.
Of note, increased hypodensity of the right cerebral peduncle is consistent with evolving Wallerian degeneration.
Prior left craniotomy defect and soft tissue scalp hematoma are noted.
Left maxillary and ethmoid air cell mucosal thickening is not significantly changed.
IMPRESSION: Stable bilateral subdural hemorrhages with no new intracranial hemorrhage identified.
No hydrocephalus or shift of the normally midline structures.
In all of these vessels bilaterally, there is echogenic material consistent with intraluminal thrombus.
There was loss of compressibility and color flow within all of these vessels.
[**2140-11-23**] ABDOMEN CT: In the limited images obtained throughout the bases of the lungs, there is right pleural thickening, left pleural effusion, and left posterolateral non-well-defined parenquimal opacity/consolidation.
There is a tiny calcified granuloma in the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe.
There are no other focal intraparenchymal lesions.
There is no biliary duct dilatation.
In the upper pole of the right kidney, there is an exophytic, round, well-defined cystic nonenhancing lesion measuring 49 x 44 mm.
There is no free fluid or free air within the abdomen.
There is no lymphadenopathy.
There is contrast in the IVC above the renal veins and IVC filter, there is no contrast seen below the IVC filter in the IVC, iliac or femoral veins.
Note is made that the study was done in late arterial phase, and there are no delayed images as this is a single monophasic study.
There is a fat-containing small umbilical hernia.
There is no free fluid.
There is no lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no concerning bone lesions.
There is a small island in the right iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**].
Moderate degenerative changes are seen in the lumbar spine.
Left pleural effusion.
Right simple renal cyst.
Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D images.
Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Mild global LV hypokinesis.
Focal calcifications in aortic root.
AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with physiologic PR.
Based on [**2132**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
The right atrium is markedly dilated.
There is  mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is  mild global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Due to suboptimal technical quality,  a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild aortic valve stenosis.
Summary on Neurosurgery service: He was sent from his PCP's office when after sustaining a fall one month ago - he has had c/o of progressive gait instability.
He had a CT scan on the outside which revealed a large subdural collection that was chronic in nature.
on [**2140-11-3**] while patient sitting on the chair found to have a left sided weakness and left sided new facial  droop and unable to follow commands.
unable to assess right eye secondary to opacity which is old.
Stat CTA of the chest revealed acute pulmonary embolus in the segmental branches to the right middle and right upper lobe.
Patient started on heparin gtt with goal PTT:40-60, medicine consulted for pulmonary issues and new PE.
bilateral lower extremity Doppler showed no evidence of DVT on initial study, though repeat study following week showed extensive bilateral DVT.
sputum culture from [**2140-11-11**] showed CITROBACTER KOSERI which is initially covered with ampicillin until sensitivity showed sensitive to Levaquin  which then started on LEVOFLOXACIN, added Flagyl for presumed aspiration pneumonia.
Postoperatively patient taken to ICU for close neuro and hemodynamic monitoring.
On [**11-19**] LFT were decreased but overall still elevated, his K was elevated as well as his BUN and creatinine.
Recs were followed and Kayexalate was given, K was followed closely, abd ultrasound was obtained showed No evidence of Budd-Chiari syndrome, with patent hepatic veins.Cholelithiasis, without evidence of cholecystitis.
There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
Fluid bolus was given for decreased urinary output.
These symptoms resolved.
Postoperatively from the Formal craniotomy Mr. [**Known lastname 55008**] [**Last Name (Titles) 263**] had been slightly elevated and is being followed closely - he is being treated to bring [**Last Name (Titles) 263**] <1.4 ( he was receiving Vit K x 3 doses as well as FFP) - currently [**2140-11-23**] he is 1.4.
dopplers were obtained and there are multiple clots in the lower venous system.
Atrial fibrillation- The patient was initially on metoprolol and uptitrated for rate control, but the patient seemed to respond better to diltiazem on a trial dose than metoprolol.
ID was consulted and agreed with empiric treatment with broad abx.
Later, the patient was found to have C. diff + stools.
On discharge, it was felt that Vanco was not needed (no MRSA h/o, neg MRSA swab), and patient was discharged on 1 week of Cefepime therapy and 10 days of Flagyl to complete a 2 week course of Cefepime for ventilator-associated PNA and Flagyl for C.dif.
The CT of abdomen to assess the clot burden to the IVC filter showed that there were no clots extending above the IVC filter.
No anticoagulation as above and provided supplement O2 and nebs treatment.
SDH s/p burr hole, craniotomy- Neurologically remained stable with spontaneous bilateral eye openings and R extremities movement.
Elevated LFTs- Was likely secondary to hypovolemia as improved with fluids.
Acute renal failure- normalized with IVF.
With collaboration with nutrtion, the patient is currently on Deliver 40cc/hr with Promod 40gm/day with flush 100cc to avoid hypernatremia (Na 146 on day of discharge).
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % Solution Sig: One (1) nebulizer treatment Inhalation Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) nebulizer treatment Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
