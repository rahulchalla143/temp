Admission Date:  [**2148-12-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2148-12-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2113-7-5**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Neurosurgery and Trauma SICU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of substance abuse with subarachnoid intercerebral hemorrhage.
Later that day he had a witnessed fall with loss of consciousness.
He eventually required intubation for airway protection due to his extreme combativeness and agitation.
A head CT subsequently revealed bilateral left greater than right subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage.
There was no documented hypotension or hypoxia at [**Hospital6 **].
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
His HEENT examination showed no hemotympanum.
His cardiac examination showed a regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
His extremities showed no deformities.
On neurologic examination, his pupils are 2 mm and trace reactive bilaterally.
He has spontaneous bilateral lower extremity movements, antigravity, but less spontaneous movements in bilateral upper extremities.
Neurologic:  Initial head CT showed a large hemorrhage contusion temporal lobe with edema and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There is a small hemorrhagic contusion in the anterior right frontal lobe.
There was also a nondisplaced right occipital fracture.
C spine CT was negative for fracture.
Head CTA showed no evidence of aneurysm.
Therefore, the likely etiology of his intracranial hemorrhages were traumatic.
On [**12-22**], a head CT showed worsening global edema with new hypoattenuation areas in the left frontal, bilateral temporal-parietal areas suspicious for infarct.
MRI showed increased flare signal and DWI in the right insula, right frontal-temporal region, left internal capsule, and left temporal regions suspicious for infarct.
His blood pressure was initially tightly controlled to be less than 130 with continuous hemodynamic monitoring and this parameters was gradually liberated over the course of admission.
His neurologic examination was followed closely throughout his admission and slowly improved, although he still continues to have significant deficits.
He had no speech output.
He was able to flex at the right elbow and shrug his shoulder, but did not have antigravity on the right.
He was seen by the neuro-rehabilitation service, who found this to be consistent with global aphasia and mild right hemiparesis mostly in the arm.
They expected that the blood and edema in the left temporal-parietal area resolved.
That he had a significant chance of recovering language and right arm function.
Cardiovascular:  There were no significant issues.
He had significant problems with secretions due to either sinusitis or pneumonia.
Chest x-ray on [**12-20**] revealed a right lung base infiltrate consistent with pneumonia.
The patient had two trials of extubation, but failed due to significant respiratory secretions.
Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  The patient as above had a goal of being euvolemic, but was at times fluid positive.
He had been afebrile for the day prior to discharge.
Orthopedics:  He did sustain a right sided transverse process fractures of L3, L4, and L5.
Bilateral left greater than right intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
