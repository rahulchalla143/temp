Admission Date:  [**2126-12-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2126-12-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2050-2-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Percocet  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**] Chief Complaint: direct admit for CHF management s/p cath  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old gentleman with a history of 3 vessel CAD s/p redo CABGx3 and multiple stents, systolic and diastolic CHF, HTN, HLD, CRF with exacerbations following cath who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with dyspnea.
Last night at 2am, the patient experienced chest pain and dyspnea.
He was taken back to the cath lab on [**12-15**] and found to have 50% recoil in the LCx and LAD with competitive flow from the LIMA.
No intervention was done.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: -Chronic Kidney disease stage III -Carotid stenosis 60-69% right ICA stenosis, 70-79% left ICA stenosis in [**7-/2125**] -DMII- last HgA1C 7.7 -Gout -PVD s/p aortobifemoral bypass -Depression and Anxiety  Social History: Retired.
He typically is able to walk short distances in his house.
Family History: B: Died of MI at 42, B: had multiple MIs; F, M: died.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
[**2-16**] Holosystolic murmur at LUSB.
No thrills, lifts.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
Bilateral femoral bruits present (chronic).
Chronic hyperpigmentation of ankles bilaterally.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
[**2126-12-16**] ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-11-4**], the degree of mitral regurgitation has increased and the degree of aortic regurgitation has decreased.
The overall extent of the pre-described bilateral and predominantly mid and lower lung parenchymal opacities, however, are unchanged.
The opacities are likely to represent a combination of infection and pulmonary edema, as emphasized in the previous written report.
Moderate cardiomegaly, presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
No evidence of pneumothorax.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly  thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**1-12**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to  moderate ([**1-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity enlargement with marked global hypokinesis.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-3-12**], the  severity of aortic regurgitation is increased (may be related to  much higher systemic blood pressure).
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) **].
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Clinical signs of heart failure with hypoxia, admit to CCU for CHF managment.

Presented with clinical signs of heart failure and was admitted to the CCU for CHF management and found to have had MI.
Had several epsides of CP in the CCU relieved with nitro.
# CHF: On arrival, patient was dyspneic, tachypenic and with a high oxygen requirement.
worse AR, MR, akinesis of inferolateral and inferior walls.
Fluid overload related to congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction, myocardial ischemia with myocaridial stunning and acute on chronic renal insufficiency from IV contrast during cath.
Furosemide drip was augmented with metolazone with improved diuresis and improvment in respiratory status.
# CORONARIES: Patient complained of CP on admission and may have had ischemia prior to cardiac cath.
Myocardial ischemia likely related to vascular recoil following previous cath.
Right coronaries not clearly visualized on cath, ischemia may be due to right coronary or LIMA disease.
Trops are elevated likely [**2-12**] to renal failure, as well as a possible coronary event.
While in the CCU, he had angina at rest and dynamic EKG changes.
His symptoms were managed medically with changing metoprolol to carvediol and Imdur 30mg daily.
# CKD: Has CKD stage III with baseline Cr 1.6-1.8.
# Peripheral vascular disease: continued pentoxifylline, aspirin, lipitor, antihypertensives.
Fe studies showed low iron during last admission,  normal b12 and folate, normal ferritin, TRF.
# Gout: stable.
We stopped his colchicine, given his renal function.
# Depression: stable.
# Transitional Issues: -Goals of care: The patient initially expressed his wish to be DNR/DNI and to have no further invasive measures taken.
-He has a reported history of silent aspiration.
He was evaluated by swallow team and was graduated up to full diet without signs or symptoms of aspiration.
