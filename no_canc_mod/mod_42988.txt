Admission Date:  [**2102-7-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2102-7-17**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Shellfish  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2972**] Chief Complaint: CC: slurred speech and left arm weakness after a nap  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Right internal carotid stent, [**2102-7-5**]   History of Present Illness: The pt.
is an 85 year-old right-handed man with a history  of CAD s/p CABG and placement of 3 stents, pacer/defibrillator, and severe chronic sensorimotor polyneuropathy, who was in his usual state of health when he fell asleep for a nap on the day of admission, then awakened a number of hours later with slurred speech, left facial droop (witnessed by pt's son), and inability to raise left arm (also witnessed by patient's son).
These symptoms improved over the course of the 90 minutes between first noticing the symptoms and presentation.
He had not been ill recently, has had no headache, dizziness, chest pain, or fever.
No known seizures.
He does complain of urinary urgency, so that he has to use the bathroom about a half hour after he drinks anything.
He was also noted to have glove and stocking distribution sensorimotor neuropathy, steppage gait, and bilateral foot drop.
stated that he felt that his speech difficulties and weakness have disappeared.
He offered no complaints other than frustration that he was confined to bed.
He denied any further episodes of dysarthria, weakness, headache.
Past Medical History: *CABG (quadruple bypass) in [**2083**] *Stents placed in 3 coronary arteries *Pacer/Defibrillator Implant  Most recent echo [**2101-10-4**]: Ejection Fraction 25-30% The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls, distal septum and apex.
The remaining walls are mildly hypokinetic.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle (does not exclude due to suboptimal apical image quality).
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-1**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No definite cardiac source of embolism identified.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2101-5-31**], septal motion is less vigorous and the distal septum and apical dysfunction are now apparent c/w interim ischemia.
*Gout *Glaucoma, Cataracts, Blind in Right Eye *B/l hearing loss *Chronic severe sensorimotor polyneuropathy Report of EMG/NCS from [**2102-6-13**]: Abnormal, complex study.
There is electrophysiologic evidence for a severe, chronic and ongoing, generalized, sensorimotor polyneuropathy with both axonal and demyelinating features.
There is also evidence for superimposed, severe, ulnar neuropathies at both elbows; the left is chronic and ongoing.
The underlying neuropathy prevents determination of whether there are superimposed ulnar neuropathies at both wrists.

Family History: 57 yo son with CAD Brother with DM.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 97 P: 70 BP: 130/67 R: 18 SaO2: 99% RA General appearance: alert elderly male in NAD Cardiac: regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops; pacemaker palpable on chest wall Pulmonary: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen: soft, nontender Extremities: no clubbing, cyanosis or edema; hypertrophy of multiple MTP joints on feet b/l without warmth or swelling.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
Able to name [**Doctor Last Name 1841**] forward and backward without difficulty.
There were no paraphrasic errors.
There is no ptosis bilaterally.
Tongue protrudes in midline; no fasciculations.
Graphesthesia and sterognosis intact.
-DTRs: 1+ biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellar and ankle jerks bilaterally.
There is no apraxia or agnosia.
There  is no left/right agnosia.
Rest  of exam was limited due to his difficulty hearing.
There is a mild left facial droop with very mild flattening of left nasolabial fold.
There is no nystagmus.
There is a fine low-amplitude tremor of hands and feet which is exacerbated by exertion (e.g.
Reflexes: The tendon reflexes are absent in the lower extremities and present but very hypoactive in the upper.
Coordination: There is mild end-point dysmetria with finger-nose  test bilaterally.
There is no titubation or truncal ataxia.
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
A lacunar infarct is again identified within the left basal ganglia and within the  right anterior limb of the caudate.
Hypodensity is seen in the periventricular white matter adjacent to the right lateral ventricle, which is more prominent than on the prior study, and also likely represents small vessel ischemic changes.
Incidental note is made of a cavum septum pellucidum.
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of major acute territorial infarction.

MRI was not possible due to presence of pacemaker, and the CT was not definitive for stroke.
He underwent a Right ICA stent on [**2102-7-5**], with complications of hypotension and confusion/delerium.
His goal SBP> 120 to prevent hypoperfusion to the CNS, so he was taken off all antihypertensives during his stay.
During his stay, he intermittently had low-grade spikes in his temperature and confusion.
He was seen by Neurology, who recommended a work-up for infection vs. metabolic vs. hypoperfusion causes.
His work-up for infection (U/A, urine cx, blood cx, CXR) was negative, and his WBC count always remained normal.
The patient also stopped having temperature spikes, and became completely afebrile around [**2102-7-10**] and has stayed that way since.
[**Name (NI) **] was no longer agitated and was off the 1:1 sitter for >24 hours.
Neurology and Psychiatry were consulted, and their recommendations included r/o infection, d/c Zyprexa and Seroquel (use Haldol for agitation), and possibly repeat a head CT if his confusion continues.
The patient was r/o again for any infection (also pt was afebrile, no WBC count), and d/c'd off the Zyprexa and Seroquel.
On [**2102-7-16**], the patient reported some mild chest pain for [**5-9**] minutes, unlike his previous angina.
An EKG was checked which showed no acute changes and 2 sets of CE's were negative.
Since then, the patient had no further chest pain.
