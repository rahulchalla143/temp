Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received Dilaudid IV/PCA with good effect and adequate pain control.
However, Medicine was consulted given her anemia and baseline hematocrit of 36.
On POD #9, however, she was found to have an elevated creatinine of 1.6, with a baseline of 0.9-1.0; at this point it is unclear whether it is pre-renal or renal secondary to possible nephrotoxicity to ciprofloxacin, which was recently discontinued.
ID: Peri-operatively, the patient received vancomycin and ciprofloxacin for broad coverage based on her history of coagulase-negative staph by previous bone biopsy.
Her wound cultures were found negative for organisms, as were her [**First Name (STitle) **] cultures.
ID recommended sending a 16s rNA PCR, which returned on [**2120-7-5**] as positive for staph epidermidis.
Heme: as discussed earlier, Medicine was consulted for the patient's anemia; iron studies were consistent with iron deficiency anemia, and the patient was placed on daily iron supplements.
She does have a history of guiac positive stools with recent colonoscopy in the last year with unremarkable findings.
[**First Name (STitle) **] for elective EGD to investigate an upper GI source for her guiac positive stools.
The graft appeared healthy with clean incision lines and dopperable signals on discharge.
At the time of discharge on POD#9, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, ambulating with crutches, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.
