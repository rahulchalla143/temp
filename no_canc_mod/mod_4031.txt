Admission Date:  [**2185-11-21**]     Discharge Date:  [**2185-11-29**]   Service:  Medicine  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Weakness and lethargy.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for hypertension and atrial fibrillation who was recently admitted from [**2185-11-6**] to [**2185-11-9**] with syncope thought to be secondary to dehydration.
He returned to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department with the acute onset of weakness and an inability to get out of bed.
He had noted fecal incontinence associated with urination (approximately six to seven times per day for the past five to six days) and now two to three times per day for the past two days.
He awoke on the morning of presentation with urinary and fecal incontinence during the night.
He was given 500 mg intravenously of Levaquin times one for a question of urosepsis, given that the urinalysis showed positive leukocyte esterase.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   On review of systems, the patient complained of chills, but no fevers.
Atrial fibrillation; status post VVI pacemaker.
Polymyalgia rheumatica.
Anal fistula repair.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Hypertension (since [**2166**]).
Status post pneumonia in [**2181**] (hospitalized).
In general, the patient was a very mildly obese Caucasian male lying in bed.
No jugular venous distention.
A quiet systolic murmur.
Extremity examination revealed no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.
No focal signs.
Urinalysis revealed large leukocyte esterase.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
Biphasic T waves in V4 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   In short, This is an 80-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for atrial fibrillation, polymyalgia rheumatica, hypertension, and recent admission for syncope secondary to dehydration who presented with weakness, incontinence, multiple bowel movements, and hypotension.
An echocardiogram from [**2185-11-22**] showed an ejection fraction of 45%, mild global left ventricular dysfunction, and a moderate-to-large circumferential pericardial effusion with a circumference of 2.5 cm.
The right ventricle was noted to be unusually small, and "stranding" was seen laterally; consistent with organization/chronicity of effusion.
The echocardiogram also showed 1+ aortic regurgitation, 1+ mitral regurgitation, and 1 to 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
The relative equalization of diastolic pressures was worrisome for tamponade physiology.
300 cc of fresh bloody fluid with clots was retrieved.
There were no organisms visualized, and the culture was negative.
Eventually, the patient's pericardial pressure came down further, and his chamber pressures normalized.
In terms of the etiology of the patient's pericardial effusion, it was most likely secondary to his polymyalgia rheumatica and chronic in nature.
The patient had an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 70, and a borderline rheumatoid factor.
Otherwise, it was still possible that this effusion was idiopathic in nature.
It was very unlikely that the patient's effusion was post myocardial infarction in nature, as the patient ruled out.
In terms of infectious causes, the patient had a negative purified protein derivative, and no organisms were seen in the effusion.
In terms of malignant causes, cytology revealed no malignant cells.
Of note, the patient is being worked up for possible colon cancer given the recent finding of colonic thickening on abdominal computed tomography.
Repeat transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2185-11-24**] revealed only a small pericardial effusion.
There were no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
(b)  Pump:  Because of the aggressive volume resuscitation at the beginning of the patient's admission, the patient went into mild congestive heart failure.
Urinalysis was significant for large leukocyte esterase.
RENAL SYSTEM:  The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency.
This was felt likely to be secondary to volume depleted.
Severe dehydration.
Hemorrhagic pericardial effusion; status post pericardiocentesis.
Polymyalgia rheumatica.
Atrial fibrillation.
