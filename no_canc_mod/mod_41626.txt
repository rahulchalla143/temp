Admission Date:  [**2139-1-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2139-1-8**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**] Chief Complaint: Chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: cardiac catheterization with 2 stents placed  History of Present Illness: 81yo man with tobacco use with several weeks of stuttering self limited exertional and nonexertional ssCP with right shoulder pain increasing in frequency.
Awoke this morning with acute worsening of same pain but persisted.
Presented to [**Hospital1 5979**] Hosp where ECG showed ST elevation v1-v4.
Given nitro with some improvement.
Mild pulm HTN with PCWP 15.
NSR with freqent PVCs, nml axis and conduction intervals .
Mild elevation of right and left filling pressures with preserved CI.
Acute MI likely due to the mid LAD lesion with possible multivessel acute ischemia.
Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant patient revealed three vessel CAD.
The LAD had a 90% occlusion after D1 with slightly decreased flow distal to this lesion.
The D1 had a ostial 60% lesion and proximal 90% lesion.
The LCX [**Male First Name (un) **] mid occlusion after OM1 with faint filling of distal vessel.
The RCA had moderate disease with 70% posteroloateral branch and 60% mid PDA.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mild elevation of right and left filling pressures with RA of 10 and PCWP of 15mmHG.
There was very mild pulmonary hypertension.
There were no arrhythmias during the case.
>>> The final angiogram showd TIMI III flow in the left coronary system with no dissection or embolisation.
There is some mild prominence of interstitial markings without evidence for focal infiltrates, pleural effusions, or pulmonary edema.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process.
Distal anterior, distal septal, and apical hypokinesis to akinesis is present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Right groin u/s:([**2139-1-7**]) In the right groin, there are findings consistent with a partially thrombosed pseudoaneurysm measuring approximately 22 x 21 x 24 mm in maximum diameters originated from the common femoral artery, the width of the neck is 3 mm.
Multiple benign-appearing lymph nodes measure less than 17 mm are seen in the right groin.
IMPRESSION: Partially thrombosed pseudoaneurysm as described originated from the common femoral artery.
On comparison with the prior study, the area of flow within the right inguinal pseudoaneurysm appears to have decreased in the interval.
Given the above findings, it is likely that this pseudoaneurysm will thrombose spontaneously and we consider that it does not require intervention (such as thrombin injection) at this time.
Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 81 M with acute anterior STEMI s/p successful percutaneous revascularization.
- continue medical mgmt # pump: no known history of congestive heart failure.
- beta blocker as above, held off on ACE-i initially for secondary elevated creatinine.
Later on it was re-started with no change of his kidney funcion.
- heparin gtt continued until patient had Echo to see if thrombus, decrased EF or apical hypokinesis.
He was bridged with Heparin given risk of clot formation and this was changed to Lovenox.
# Groin Hematoma: U/S showed a partially thrombosed pseudoaneurism [**2139-1-7**].
follow up ultrasound on [**2139-1-8**] showed increased thrombosis.
Interventional Radiology thought that it would likely will finish up trhombosing itself.
No intervention for now.
# Bipolar - No evidence of mania or depression now.
# CRI - Followed by Nephrology at OSH.
No history of diabetes or HTN.
# Hyperglycemia - sugars can be elevated peri-MI period.
