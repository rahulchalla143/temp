Pertinent Results: [**2190-7-3**] CT/CTA Brain CT HEAD: There is a right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage seen adjacent to the falx with surrounding edema.
Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage identified in the basal cisterns along the sulci and interhemispheric fissure.
In addition, there is slight protuberance seen on the posterior aspect of the internal carotid artery near the right posterior communicating artery origin which could be due to a small infundibulum.
There is no vasospasm seen.
CT head demonstrates intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right frontal region and diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage with developing hydrocephalus.
Other findings as described above including probable infundibulum at the origin of right posterior cerebral artery.
The lungs are clear with no evidence of consolidation, pneumothorax, or effusion.
Otherwise, no acute cardiopulmonary process visualized.
INDICATION: Patient presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage and was found to have anterior cerebral artery aneurysm on the right side.
General anesthesia was induced in the supine position.
This revealed the aneurysm on the right anterior cerebral artery at the junction of the pericallosal and callosal marginal artery.
Following this, the aneurysm was catheterized with an SL-10 microcatheter and a Synchro microwire.
The aneurysm was coiled starting with a 3 mm 360 UltraSoft Target coil followed by a 2 mm coil of a similar configuration.
Following this the aneurysm was obliterated except for a small residual neck.
A right common femoral artery arteriogram was done and a 6 French Angio-Seal was used for closure of the right common femoral artery puncture site.
FINDINGS: Left common carotid artery arteriogram shows filling of the left internal carotid artery along the cervical, petrous, cavernous and supraclinoid portion.
There is no evidence of any other aneurysms on this injection.
Both the posterior cerebral arteries are well visualized with no evidence of aneurysms.
Right internal carotid artery arteriogram shows that the anterior and middle cerebral artery fills well.
There is a 4 mm into 3 mm aneurysm at the junction of the pericallosal and callosal marginal artery on the right side.
Right internal carotid artery arteriogram status post coiling shows that the aneurysm in the anterior cerebral artery is completely obliterated except for a small residual neck.
Right common femoral artery arteriogram shows a widely patent right common femoral artery.
IMPRESSION: EU critical [**Doctor First Name 7279**] underwent cerebral angiography and coil Embolization of a distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysm leaving a small residual at the neck.

The hemorrhage exerts increased mass effect on the adjacent falx and frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
Endovascular coils are seen in the midline of the frontal lobes at the site of coiling of a distal right ACA aneurysm.
Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage is again seen along the frontal sulci, interhemispheric fissure and into the basilar cisterns.

These findings are consistent with non-convulsive status epilepticus.
Electrographic seizures occupied nearly the entire recording.
Between seizures, the background was slow and disorganized with no apparent alpha rhythm.
