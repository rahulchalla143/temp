Consolidative process within the right lower lobe consistent with atelectasis vs pneumonia.
The appearence is not typical of a AVM although if blood pressure drop observed a urgent Chest CT is warrented.
New moderate-sized right pleural effusion.
Scattered mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, the largest measuring 1.1 cm in short axis.
Small pericardial effusion.
Overall slight decrease in size of moderate loculated right pleural fluid collection following placement of right-sided chest tube.
Although majority of pleural fluid is simple in appearance, a high attenuation focus may represent a hemorrhagic component as discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] by telephone on the date of the study.
Atelectatic changes in the right middle and lower lobes adjacent to effusion.
Slight decrease in small pericardial effusion.
Loculated gas collections within right pleural fluids, which are likely related to recent intervention with chest tube and pigtail catheter in place.5.
Moderate degenerative changes within the thoracic spine.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 67 yo M with a history of diabetes and hypertension who presented with hemoptysis and was found to have community acquired pneumonia with effusion.
He initially was given levofloxacin that was changed early on to Zosyn/azithromycin but CXR showed pleural effusion.
Pleural fluid continued to accumulate and a chest tube was placed by IP and had intermittent drainage.
However on [**5-4**] he was found to be somnolent and in respiratory distress after receiving 8mg morphine and 2 mg dilaudid for pain at the chest tube site.
The Vanc was discontinued but the patient had persistent effusions and a VATS was done on [**5-9**].
He was extubated a few hours after the procedure and has done well since then (except for brief hypotension while on the propofol gtt in the MICU).
Little evidence for aspiration based on history.
Vanc was later added given persistent parapneumonic effusion growing gram (+) cocci.
Had no symptoms at time of discharge.
MS changes: Patient was noted to have mental status changes but this occured in the setting of morphine and dilaudid and the transfer to the ICU.
Parapneumonic effusion: Loculated/complex effusion likely parapneumonic.
CT showed persistent effusion w/ loculated regions not being drained by chest tube.
pt experienced an episode of acute respiratory distress with hypoxia and mental status changes in the setting of over sedation from narcotics.
No evidence of PE on CTA.
No evidence of malignancy.
No coagulopathy.
Small pericardial effusion.
No evidence of tamponade.
He continued to have elevated glucoses and therefore was sent home with an insulin regimen.
Renal failure.
Pt w/ recent proteinuria--possibly diabetic nephropathy.
[**Month (only) 116**] be due to patient swallowing hemoptysis.
No concern for GI bleed at this time.
No active issues.
Pneumonia 3.
Pleural effusion 4.
Small pericardial effusion  Secondary: 1.
Type II diabetes mellitus 3.
Hypertension 4.
Chronic renal failure, baseline creatinine 1.2-1.8 5.
History of nephrolithiasis 9.
Status post cholecystectomy   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, vital signs stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized with hemoptysis (coughing blood) and found to have pneumonia.
Please contact a physician if you experience fevers, chills, chest pain, increasing shortness of breath, increased cough, or any other concerning symptoms.
