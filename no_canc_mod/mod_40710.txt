No other fractures are identified.
Mild degenerative changes are seen in the thoracolumbar spine.
No acute traumatic injury identified in the chest.
Non-displaced fracture of the right transverse processes of L2 vertebra, of indeterminate age, but could represent an acute fracture.

Trace right pleural effusion.
Adenomyomatosis and possible impacted stones of the gallbladder fundus.
No true external rotation view was obtained and the Y view is also slightly suboptimal.

There is likely at least anterior medial subluxation of the humeral head in relation to the glenoid fossa.
No evidence of acute fracture.
Suggestion of anterior medial subluxation of the right humeral head in relation to the glenoid fossa, of indeterminate age.
THREE VIEWS, RIGHT SHOULDER: On these three limited views of the shoulder there is a suggestion of anterior subluxation of the humeral head upon the glenoid fossa.
There are moderate degenerative changes of the acromioclavicular joint.
SIX VIEWS, RIGHT SHOULDER: There is anterior subluxation of the humeral head upon the glenoid fossa.
There is deformity of the humeral head laterally which could represent a [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name 3450**] deformity.
There also may be a small osseous fragment inferior to the glenoid which could reflect Bankart injury.

atypical ALS and frequent falls who presented after a mechanical fall down stairs and prolonged period on floor who was found to have a right transverse process L2 fracture and shoulder subluxation and had a brief MICU stay for hypothermia and rhabdomyolysis.
# Fall/Pre-syncope: Per patient, fall was mechanical and has had many previous falls.
Given history of numerous falls, she will likely need placement in [**Hospital3 **] or other sheltered housing on discharge as she lives alone.
ACS ruled out with serial cardiac biomarkers.
She sustained possible acute right shoulder subluxation in addition to L2 transverse process fracture which were both managed conservatively.
She was treated with a warming blanket and fluid rescusitated, and body temperature normalized overnight.
# Rhabdomyolysis: CK on arrival was 3387 and was noted to trend down from that point with fluid rescusitation.
Elevated CK was felt secondary to a prolonged period down following her fall.
# Likely acute on chronic right shoulder subluxation: Initial exam was concerning for anterior dislocation of right shoulder but XR showed right anterior subluxation of the humeral head upon the glenoid fossa.
Per discussion with family, this may be a chronic or acute on chronic injury.
Patient had recent shoulder dislocation [**2-8**] which was relocated at ED.
She was evaluated by the vascular surgery team for concern over poor peripheral pulses in her right arm, but was felt to have adequate perfusion and good pulse was present.
# L2 FRACTURE: On CT Torso patient was found to have an undisplaced right L2  transverse process fracture.
The patient was evaluated by the neurosurgery consult team, with recommendation for no limitation to activity and conservative management with pain control.
No evidence of bleeding.
If persistent hypertension at rehab, can add diltiazem.
# Diarrhea: Patient developed frequent loose stools on [**2-17**].
Stools were sent for culture and c difficile toxin.
# Pulmonary nodule: Sub-4-mm pulmonary nodules in both lungs seen on CT-Thorax.
Medications on Admission: Aspirin 81mg qd Diltiazem ER 240mg qd Atenolol 50mg qd Lisinopril 40mg qd  Discharge Medications: 1. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 582**] @ [**Hospital1 189**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Mechanical fall in setting of frequent falls Likely acute on chronic right shoulder subluxation Undisplaced right transverse fracture of L2 Rhabdomyolysis Hypothermia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent with likely chronic cognitive deficit Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
The scans showed evidence of a possibly new worsening of a right shoulder injury in addition to a tiny fracture involving one of the vertebrae of your lower back.
You were also seen by neurosurgery who felt that nothing needed to be done for your back injury and it will heal on its own.
You were also seen by orthopaedics for your shoulder injury who recommended a sling and follow-up with them.
Changes to medications: We HELD you diltiazem at present and can be restarted as necessary on discharge We STARTED tramdol 25-50mg as needed every 6 hours for pain We STARTED acetaminophen 650mg as needed every 6 hours for pain We STARTED laxatives We STARTED calcium and vitamin D   Followup Instructions: Please make an appointment with your PCP on discharge.
