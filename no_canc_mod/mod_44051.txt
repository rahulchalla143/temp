Since transfer to the MICU the patient has done well without need for intubation, pressors, or additional fluid support.
The patient was additionally noted on imaging to have a new left lower lobe bronchial consolidation thought to represent likely bacterial pneumonia superimposed on viral influenza.
No sputum cultures are currently available.
ALLERGIES: None  Past Medical History: HTN Hypercholesterolemia R breast DCIS s/p partial mastectomy and radiation therapy in [**2130**]  Social History: Patient is seperated from her husband and works as a meat clerk at [**Company **].
She quit chewing tobacco 15 years (30 year habit previously)   Family History: Mother has hypertension and perhaps coronary artery disease.

Microbiology: Blood cultures: [**2132-4-19**] x 3: No growth .
Urine cultures: [**4-19**]: mixed flora [**4-19**]: No growth .
[**4-19**]: Influenza A/B by DFA - positive for Influenza A, negative for B .
No pneumothorax.
Bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged when compared to chest radiograph obtained earlier the same day.
No pneumothorax.
There is equivocal evidence of increased retrocardiac opacity.
Pneumonia is not excluded.
[**2132-4-19**]: Chest Pa/Lat - Again, seen is aortic tortuosity and mild cardiomegaly.
Nodular pleural thickening at the right apex is stable since [**2117**].
Linear opacities are seen in the left base as well as a small opacity in the right base laterally, which were not present on the prior study.
IMPRESSION: Opacities at the bases could represent pneumonia or atelectasis.
No pneumothorax.
There is a new retrocardiac opacity consistent with atelectasis and and/or infiltrate.
There are new bilateral small pleural effusions.
There is bibasilar atelectasis.
No pulmonary edema.
New left lower lobe opacity, either atelectasis and/or infiltrate.
New pleural effusions.
New right basilar atelectasis.

Sepsis: The patient was admitted to the MICU after having met criteria for code sepsis with hypotension not responsive to 5L NS, accompanied by fevers and suspicion of infection.
In the ED, tamponade was considered given low voltage on ECG although bedside echo demonstrated no pericardial effusion or RV collapse.
The patient had blood cultures drawn on admission that demonstrated no growth.
As above, nasal aspirates were positive for Influenza.
Although radiographically the patient had evidence for a consolidative pneumonia, respiratory cultures revealed oropharyngeal flora only.
The patient was admitted to the MICU with diagnosis of influenza pneumonia with superimposed bacterial pneumonia.
The patient responded well to treatment and did not require pressors or intubation.
On transfer to the floor the patient had a 4L NC oxygen requirement, likely secondary to her underlying pneumonia as well as mild fluid overload from aggressive fluid support.
Her O2 requirement resolved over the course of two days with ongoing supportive therapy as well as auto-diuresis.
# Leukopenia - On admission the patient was noted to have a white count of 6.2 with 11% bands as above.
The patients white count was then noted to drop with nadir of 2.1, likely secondary to myelosuppression from viral infection.
The patient's Hct stabilized with termination of volume resuscitation and auto-diuresis with Hct on discharge 32.6. .
HTN: Given hypotension on admission the patient's outpatient antihypertensive regimen of lisinopril and HCTZ were initially held.
Medications on transfer: Levofloxacin 500 mg PO Q24H Order date: [**4-19**] @ 1345 Acetaminophen 325-650 mg PO Q4-6H:PRN Atorvastatin 20 mg PO DAILY Oseltamivir Phosphate 75 mg PO BID Duration: 4 Days Heparin 5000 UNIT SC TID Ibuprofen 400 mg PO Q8H:PRN (Holding antihypertensives given hypotension on admission)  Discharge Medications: 1.
