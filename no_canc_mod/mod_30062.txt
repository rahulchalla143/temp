Since then he has had fevers to 37.8.
THe pain in his back was somewhat improved.
He presented to the ED and was found to have elevated BP to 210/100.
Since previous tracing of [**2165-9-30**], no significant change .
Findings consistent with an intramural hematoma of the aorta extending from the upper most image acquired on this study above the diaphragmatic hiatus through to the level of the aortic bifurcation, possibly involving the right common iliac artery.
Multiple left-sided renal cysts and multiple hypodense lesions too small to characterize in the kidneys bilaterally that may represent cysts.
No renal stones identified.
[**6-11**] CTA: Aortic intramural hematoma that appears to extend proximally from the level of the take off of the left subclavian artery, and distally through to the level of the bifurcation of the aorta, also apparently involving the proximal right common iliac artery.
[**6-12**] CTA: Compared to the exam of [**2167-6-11**], no significant change in the appearance of the aortic intramural hematoma.
No evidence of new retroperitoneal hemorrhage or fluid collections.
No evidence of epidural abscess.
Diffusely abnormal bone marrow signal, which appears nonspecific but may be seen in diffuse bone marrow infiltration or chronic illness.
CXR: No radiographic evidence of pneumonia .
The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
No evidence of endocarditis seen.
No evidence of an epidural abscess.
Cervical spondylosis with mild central stenosis and severe narrowing of neural foramina at multiple levels.
MRI T-SPINE ([**6-18**]) No evidence of an epidural abscess   Brief Hospital Course: 1) AORTIC DISSECTION: Intramural aortic hematoma seen on CT scan in ED.
Vascular surgery consulted who felt it was consistent with a Type B Aortic dissection.
He was also told to call his provider or go to the ER if he experienced chest pain, difficulty breathing, dizziness, or blurry vision.
3) FEVER: Patient had a low grade temperature at admission and it continued throughout his hospital course.
Ultimately, the infectious disease service felt that his fevers were due to his aortic intramural hematoma.
Eventually, he became afebrile while off all antibiotics for several days.
Work-up revealed low iron, normal TIBC, and high ferritin, as well as a borderline low B12 level.
The MRI of the L-spine commented on a diffusely abnormal signal pattern from the bone marrow.
It was consistent with findings of anemia of chronic disease or inflammation.
