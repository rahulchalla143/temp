[**9-14**] CXR SINGLE VIEW OF THE CHEST: Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable, with persistent enlarged cardiac silhouette.
No focal consolidations are seen within the lungs.
No evidence of pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process or significant change from prior.
[**9-16**] CXR FINDINGS: There is no significant interval change in the frontal view when compared to prior.
The lateral projection shows some pleural thickening which could be some loculated fluid posteriorly and some discoid atelectasis as well.
No new consolidation.
[**9-17**] LE U/S neg for DVT .
There is some patchy increase in density in the left lower lung field, probably in the lingula, which is unchanged from prior examination and likely represents subsegmental atelectasis.
No frank consolidation is seen.
IMPRESSION: No significant change in the appearances since the study of [**2111-9-17**] with atelectasis/airspace disease in the left lower lung zone.

Orthopedics followed her throughout her hospital stay given concern that she might develop compartment syndrome; serial exams were without evidence of this.
The patient has a history of recurrent rhabdomyolysis with extensive prior work-up.
In the past, rheumatology has suspected narcotic-related myotoxicity (prolonged treatment with high dose opioids for chronic pain), although adult-onset metabolic myopathy was an another unlikely possibility.
2 prior muscle biopsies were not consistent with polymyositis.
Per patient, she was only taking MS contin, discussion with her pharmacy revealed she was also filling scripts for percocet and oxycodone.
Acute renal failure: Creatinine peaked at 2.1 from a baseline Cr 0.5, likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis.
Pneumonia: Given a persistent cough, a chest X-ray was obtained, which showed a left lower lung opacity (atelectasis versus infiltrate).
She will complete a 10 day course of levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia  #.
Chronic Pain: The patient has a history of naroctic abuse, and has multiple violations of her PCP-[**Name10 (NameIs) 107156**] narcotic contract.
The pain management service was consulted and followed her closely throughout her hospital stay.
Her pain was managed with Tylenol, hydromorphone 2-mg PO q3-4 PRN; MS contin was decreased from 150 [**Hospital1 **] to 90 [**Hospital1 **] over her hospital course.
Her iron studies were consistent with iron-deficiency anemia.
Lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: [**12-10**] - 1 Tablet PO q 8 hrs prn as needed for anxiety.
Ambien 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO at bedtime as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Home with Service  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Rhabdomyolysis Secondary: acute renal failure, hypertension, hypothyroidism, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, asthma, steroid-induced type II diabetes, iron-deficiency anemia, fibromyalgia  Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable Ambulatory   Discharge Instructions: Please take all medications as instructed.
If you experience any fever, increased leg pain, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms please seek medical attention immediately.
