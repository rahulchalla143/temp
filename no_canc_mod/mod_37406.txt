Per uptodate, african american patients are at higher risk of angioedema with ACE-I's, even several years after beginning the medication, making this mechanism much more likely.
We instructed patient multiple times to avoid shellfish and trandolapril or any other ACE-I's.
We wrote him for rx's for prednisone, benadryl and famotidine for 3 days after dispo, and instructed him not to drive or drink alcohol while on benadryl.
We instructed him to call 911 if he becomes dizzy, blurred vision, has a painful headache or chest pain, as these may be signs of too high blood pressure.
