Discharged to rehab initially where she was noted to have a new 02 requirement (not on oxygen at home previously), and presented from rehab on [**12-23**] to [**Hospital3 1280**] w/ acute SOB.
As pt had acute renal failure, no PE workup was done.
Pt developed fever to 101 on [**12-27**], with leukocytosis and was C diff positive.
Repeat echo showed depressed EF at 30%.
Pt had two episodes of chest pain where CE cycled and neg x 3 no EKG changes.
On [**12-29**] pt had an episode of hypotension and was started on dopamine because she was already so fluid overloaded.
Pt was intubated at that time for persistant dyspnea and respiratory decline.

ECHO Study Date of [**2120-12-30**] 1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (30-35% ) Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include basal inferior, inferoseptal and inferolateral akinesis .
4.The aortic root is mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.

There is mild mitral stenosis.There is trace MR. 7.There is mild to moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CXR sent w/ pt on transfer [**12-29**] notable for bilateral infiltrates [**3-12**] way up both lung fields.
Concern for pulm edema and CHF on top of baseline COPD.
ABG at time of intubation revealed a respiratory acidosis.
Post extubation the patient continued to have intermitent episodes of tachypnea and hypoxia requiring additional oxygen supplementation in the form of a face mask and nasal cannula.
These were thought to be related to fluid overload and flash pulmonary edema related to increased activity.
CV: Patient with known CAD s/p CABG with reportedly patent grafts by cath [**2119**].
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed soon after her initial arrival to the ICU in order to differentiate the nature of her shock (cardiogenic vs. septic).
She had Cardiac output of 9 with low SVR of 460 showing a picture more consistent with septic as opposed to cardiogenic shock.
Her cardiac enzymes were cycled during this admission and she did not have a rise in her troponin.
At the time of discharge the patient continued to be on a statin, ASA, B-blocker, and ACE for BP control.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] the time of discharge the pt still had evidence of fluid overload as part of her CHF exacerbation and was benefiting from continued diuresis with Lasix.
Renal was consulted during the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay for concern for AIN in setting of Ceftaz administration but results from urine sediment were more consistent with ATN (muddy brown casts seen in urine and patient had relatively quick recovery).
Patient was started on steroids on admission in the setting of sepsis and continued for suspected AIN, will be discharged on a slow oral taper of prednisone.
No hemothorax developed.
No further issues.
Anemia of Chronic Dz: On admission to ICU, patient had iron studies which were abnormal but non-diagnostic in the setting sepsis.
She completed a 14 day course of Flagyl while at [**Hospital1 18**] and surveillence c diff after therapy was negative.
Coagulopathy: On transfer, patient had an elevated INR as she was on coumadin previously s/p CVA.
Septic Arthritis of right hip: Aspirate done on [**12-28**] at [**Location (un) 620**] showed rare growth of coag neg staph that was pan-sensitive.
After initial removal of hardware on [**12-5**] the patient was started On vanco and levo and was planned to continue these antibiotics until [**2121-1-19**] for supposed GNR and definite GPC on gram stain in OR [**12-5**].
She will be given 1g IV daily, which is adjusted for her renal function, but may require monitoring of levels if her renal function worsens.
Rash: On admission to [**Hospital1 18**] patient had a diffuse, puritic maculopapular rash thought to be related to Ceftaz administration at the OSH.
Her rash became less erythematous and less puritic during the admission.
FEN: cardiac diet, low sodium diet.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
