Admission Date:  [**2157-10-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2157-10-7**]  Date of Birth:  [**2111-10-28**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Fexofenadine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**] Chief Complaint: RCA dissection  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intra Aortic Balloon Pump- placed in OSH, removed here at [**Hospital1 18**]   History of Present Illness: 45yo Spanish-speaking woman w/ HTN, DM2, anxiety and seizure disorder who presented to her PCP w/ chest pain.
Her chest pain was relieved by nitro and she was admitted for r/o MI.
Catheterization revealed no left main disease or LAD disease.
Following Cath she developed chest pain and reported ST elevations.
Repeat cath revealed spiral dissection to distal vessels with proximal occlusion.
She reportedly became bradycardic to the 30's and received 0.75 mg atropine.
A stent was deployed across the distention with likely jailing off of the acute marginal branch.
On arrival she complained of chest pain with radiation to the back.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Type 2 DM w/ A1c of 9 - Depression/anxiety - Hyponatremia, attributed to polydipsia and diuretic use - Seizure disorder - on Depakote and Keppra?
Sclera anicteric.
CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
ABDOMEN: Soft nontender EXTREMITIES: No femoral bruits.
SKIN: Stasis dermatitis.
No ulcers or scars.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
If indicated, a repeat study with echo contrast may better assess basl to mid RV free wall function  Repeat Echo few days later: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional left ventricular systolic function.
Dilated RV with free wall hypokinesis.
There is pressure/volume overload of the right ventricle.
The estimated pulmonary artery pressures are only mildly elevated - may be UNDERestimated.
Small pericardial effusion located mostly posterior to the left ventricle without tamponade physiology.
Brief Hospital Course: 48 YO woman with multiple cardiac risk factors s/p cardiac cath to R/O CAD complicated by RCA dissection and likely jailing of acute marginal branch in setting of placement of 3 stents, transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU with clinical picture concerning for acute MI of the RV.
# Coronaries/Chest pain: Symptoms and EKG findings (STE in Inferior leads III>II with STE in RV leads is consistent) consistent with RV infarct likely proximal RCA.
Pt's RCA dissection was secondary iatrogenic causes which temporarily disrutped flow through RCA.
Three stents were placed which jailed off some of the braching arteries resulting in post-procedure troponin bump.
Echo showed dilated RV with free wall hypokinesis.
# RHYTHM: Initially had Junctional escape rhythm and then atrial escape rhythm likely secondary to ischemia of sinus node from jailing off of proximal RCA branches.
# Hyperkalemia: Initially had hyperkalemia on transfer with some T-wave elevations.
No further hyperkalemia.
# Seizure disorder: Spoke with outpatient neurologist and patient was given her outpatient seizure regimen.
# DM: ISS and held metformin .
