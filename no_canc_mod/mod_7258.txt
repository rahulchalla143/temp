Admission Date:  [**2153-1-6**]              Discharge Date:   [**2153-2-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2106-5-1**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine / Penicillins / Haldol / Cellcept / Vancomycin / Amitriptyline / Iron / Reglan / Amikacin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3624**] Chief Complaint: Bacteremia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: RIJ portacath removed, RIJ TPL placed  History of Present Illness: 46 year-old male c ESRD s.p renal tpl x 4, HCV, HTN, aortic stenosis who is transferred from NH with bacteremia.
Port was placed at [**Hospital3 68**] on [**12-16**] for ARF from dehydration from nausea and vomiting.
On [**1-2**] he spiked a fever of 101.9; blood cultures were positive for MRSA on [**1-2**] and group D enterococcus.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from an OSH for worsening renal failure and hypotension, felt to be possibly due to orthostasis.
Here, he was found to have MRSA in his urine which was treated with linezolid (last dose planned for [**12-15**]).
He was in renal failure at the OSH and required HD.
Here his peak Cr was 4.0 (felt to be due to bactrim, which was initially used to treat his MRSA) and it was felt that he had a prerenal azotemia in addition to drug toxicity.
He remained on cyclosporine for his renal transplant, along with azathioprine and prednisone.
Multiple etiologies were entertained, including cervical cord compression (MRI showed C5-6 disc herniation and moderate spinal stenosis), hypovolemia, medication effects (he was on labetalol and prazosin at the time), and neuropathy.
At the OSH, he had had a hypercarbic respiratory failure but he was extubated without incident and had no other respiratory issues as an inpatient at [**Hospital1 18**].
On arrival he complains of bilateral arm and leg pain ([**8-26**]).
End-stage renal disease.
Right lower extremity phlebitis.

Aortic stenosis.
Gout 18. h/o abnormal chest x-ray with multiple lung nodules last year  .
Hernia repair.
Right shoulder replacement.
HEENT - R corneal clouding, left PERRL.
Neck - no cervical LAD CV - 3/6 SEM best at RUSB, radiating to b/t carotids Chest - port to R anterior chest wall, non-tender, no erythema or fluctuance.
Lungs - wheezes to right base posteriorly, fine crackles to left base.
Abd - soft, multiple well-healed scars.
graft in LLQ with tenderness with deep palpation.
minimal usage of right arm (despite reporting right-handedness) but will use when instructed Skin - chronic venous stasis changes to b/t LE, R>L.
no bruising; multiple well healed scars on abdomen  Pertinent Results: LABORATORY VALUES:  DISCHARGE LABS: WBC 3.6 HCT 23.1 PLT 232 PT 34.4 INR 3.6  Na 140 K 4.5 Cl 103 HCO3 28  BUn 30 Cr 2.5 Gluc 82 (at HD) LFTs: [**2153-2-12**] ALT 10 AST 12 LDH 169 AP 205 Bili 0.3  HEMATOLOGIC Iron Binding Capacity, Total 155* ug/dL 260 - 470 Ferritin 188 ng/mL 30 - 400 Transferrin 119* mg/dL 200 - 360  THYROID Parathyroid Hormone 318* pg/mL 15 - 65  HEP C AB : POSITIVE  TEE: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Acute/subacute nonocclusive thrombus within the right common femoral vein extending into the greater saphenous vein and proximal superficial femoral vein.
Large right central disc extrusion at the C5/6 level as before, which is severely compressing the right ventral cord and causing cord edema.
New diffuse edema of the visualized subcutaneous fat as well as new minimal amount of prevertebral edema/fluid.
The lack of IV gadolinium limits the evaluation for infectious process.
However, given the generalized nature of the edema, the prevertebral findings likely represent changes of generalized edema as opposed to prevertebral cellulitis from an infectious process.
Minimal amount of T2 hyperintensity of the anterior disc at the C5/6 and C6/7 levels, which is a nonspecific finding.
No obvious enhancement in the intervertebral discs at C5-6 and C6-7 levels.
No evidence of discitis at these levels.
Unchanged appearance of the small amount of prevertebral edema/fluid in the cervical spine; mild increase in the posterior spinal soft tissue increased signal from edema/inflammation.
No obvious abscess is noted, within the limitations of this study from patient motion artifacts.
No evidence of cord compression in the thoracic spine.
Severe cord compression in the cervical spine, from large right paracentral disc extrusion at C5-6, unchanged.
Large bilateral pleural effusions.
No evidence of meningitis or acute intracranial process.
Bilateral increased signal in both mastoid sinuses is suggestive of mastoiditis.
Intrahepatic biliary dilatation has increased since [**2148-11-16**].
The common bile duct tapers from a maximum of approximately 8 mm to 6 mm in the region of the pancreatic head which is incompletely visualized due to overlying bowel gas.
Bilateral hip XR: FINDINGS: Frontal view of the pelvis and cone down views of each hip demonstrate some rounded peripheral calcifications that are presumed to be in the soft tissues measuring 3.3 cm on the right and 1.2 cm on the left with dense vascular calcifications.
Scattered clips overlie the lower abdomen.
No fracture is identified.
Bilateral knee XR: On the right, there are mixed lucent and sclerotic irregular moderately well defined geographic lesions in the distal femur and proximal tibia most likely representing bone infarcts.
Some increased density deep to the medial femoral condyle may also reflect a subchondral bone infarct.
Dense vascular calcification noted.
Probable diffuse osteopenia.
A small bone island is seen in the proximal medial tibia.
Of note, there is a focal multilobulated lucent lesion extending to the articular surface of the lateral femoral condyle, with a thin sclerotic rim measuring approximately 2.0 x 3.2 cm.
There is background osteopenia.
Possible small joint effusion.
No acute fracture identified.
Focal lucent lesion in the left lateral femoral condyle.
There appears relatively extensive to represent a subchondral cyst or interosseous ganglion.
Differential diagnosis includes a chondroid lesion or possibly a brown tumor.
Of note, on the lateral view, the cortex over this is thinned and if not present already, the possibility of a pathologic fracture in this location should be considered.
# ID - POLYMICROBIAL BACTEREMIA, LINE SOURCE, ?GI source: MRSA, Enterococcus, [**Female First Name (un) 564**] from [**1-2**] blood cx and OSH blood cx, likely from R chest portacath that was removed soon after admission.
TTE showed possible vegetations, but TEE showed no vegetations, no abscess, no endocarditis.
Optho assessed the patient for candidal retinitis, found none, no intravitreous abx needed, but the patient has ocular Alport's findings and is blind in his R eye.
On [**1-14**], a CT abdomen incidentally showed effusions and a CXR was done.
It showed cavitary lesions in LUL.
Fluconazole was continued for + Blood Cultures, daptomycin continued for MRSA as indicated for bacteremia, and Linezolid was started for possible abscess in lungs.
The reason Vanco was not started initially was because pt had a question of an allergy to it (thus needed coverage with aztreonam and linezolid as above).
Pseudomonas grew from the urine and he was switched to aztreonam because of his penicillin allergy to cover the pseudomonas.
Briefly he was transitioned back from linezolid to vancomycin but he was switched back because of leukopenia that developed from the vancomycin.
He also intermittently had abdominal pain and an elevated alk phos.
GI was consulted and because of a previously seen dilated common bile duct they recommended a MRCP.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, KNOWN CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE, ALPORTS, S/P TRANSPLANT : Most recent transplant in [**2145**].
Has chronic renal insufficiency (discharged with Cr of 2.4) from Alport's syndrome.
Renal function was worsening and pt was initiated on dialysis on [**1-14**].
Unclear etiology for renal failure, possibly [**2-17**] antibiotics, bacteremia, or prerenal.
Renal U/S not complete as pt uncooperative but no hydronephrosis.
The patient does not have focal neurological deficits.
# RLE DVT: The patient was noted to have R>L edema in his legs.
US showed new partially occlusive thrombus in distal SFV.
There was no evidence of renal artery stenosis on US from [**11-23**].
On the floor, his blood pressures again decreased in the setting of a more active infection necessitating holding his BP meds.
Anemia - Patient was noted to below baseline and was guaiac positive.
His HCT was monitored and he was given iron and epogen at dialysis  # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient was initially transfered to the unit for respiratory failure.
ALL: codeine -> n/v PCN -> unknown haldol -> unknown cellcept -> unknown vancomycin -> unknown amitryptyline -> unknown IV iron -> anaphylaxis (?)
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Polymicrobial sepsis w/ [**Female First Name (un) **], enterobacter, and MRSA DVT of RLE Pseudomonas UTI Renal failure C5-6 cord compression  Secondary diagnoses: Alport's syndrome s/p kidney transplant x4, still on immunosuprresion ESRD on HD Hepatitis C Seizure disorder R eye blindness R ear hearing loss PVD h/o SBO Osteoporosis HTN h/o GIB Aortic stenosis h/o endocarditis h/o RLE DVT in [**2148**] h/o gout   Discharge Condition: Stable.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with sepsis felt to be due to an infected port-a-cath.
You likely suffered septic emboli to your lungs and your pulmonary status should be monitored regularly given that you have known cavitary lesions in your lung.
We were unable to determine why you developed this line infection, but you are currently being treated successfully with linezolid and fluconazole.
You also developed worsening renal failure and were started on hemodialysis.
You were found to have a DVT of your RLE while you were hospitalized.
You were initially treated with heparin and then lovenox until you became therapeutic on coumadin.
You were monitored by ortho-spine who felt that you could undergo decompression in the future, either once you begin to develop symptoms or once you complete your course of anticoagulation.
We recommend that you follow-up with your PCP to schedule this as an outpatient, given that you have a history of colonic polyps in the past.
