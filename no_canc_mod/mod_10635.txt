Prenatal course was significant for spontaneous dichorionic diamniotic twins, cervical shortening and preterm labor at 28 weeks.
The mother was admitted on [**2128-7-14**], for induction secondary to suspected IUGR in Twin A and oligohydramnios in Twin B.
There was no maternal fever, artificial rupture of membranes approximately four hours prior to delivery.
Due to the lack of respiratory effort, the infant was intubated at four minutes of life, grimace was noted at the time of intubation but no spontaneous movements.
The infant was admitted to the NICU for perinatal depression and prematurity.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Minimal to no spontaneous movements.
Anterior fontanelle open and flat, nondysmorphic features.
Normal S1 and S2, no murmurs.
Hip stable and slightly small.
There was some jitteriness noted.
The patient had increased tone throughout with some contracture of the left arm.
She has had apnea of prematurity with the last episode occurring on the day of life three.
No further episodes 48 to 72 hours prior to the transfer.
Cardiovascular - The infant had transient hypotension initially requiring two normal saline boluses and Dopamine.
No murmur on physical examination.
FEN - Given question of perinatal depression, the infant was not started on enteral feeds until day of life one when her apnea resolved and she was extubated.
Hematology - The infant's initial hematocrit was 36.5 with question of possible fetal maternal hemorrhage.
Follow-up maternal test for fetal maternal hemorrhage would be negative.
Gastrointestinal - The infant had mild hyperbilirubinemia with bilirubin level peaking on day of life two at 8.7 at which time single phototherapy was started.
Infectious disease - Given her perinatal depression, the infant was started on Ampicillin and Gentamicin for sepsis rule out.
Neurology - The infant had perinatal depression of unclear etiology.
There was no seizure activity and the initial hypotonia with contracture had resolved.
She had a head ultrasound on day of life zero which was negative for intraventricular hemorrhage.
CONDITION ON TRANSFER:  The infant has been in room air with occasional apnea of prematurity, last episode occurred on day of life three, on [**2128-7-17**].
Perinatal depression of unclear etiology.
