Admission Date:  [**2147-6-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2147-6-16**]  Date of Birth:  [**2068-2-6**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: acute on chronic systolic heart failure  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 78M with a medical history of CAD s/p CABG ([**2139**] LIMA->diag, SVG->OM1, SVG->LAD), s/p stent to LAD, [**Year (4 digits) **] to RCA ([**2146**]), systolic heart failure secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 20-30% [**2141**]), history of NSVT s/p ICD implantation ([**2141**]) transferred from [**Hospital6 17032**] for further management of acute on chronic systolic heart failure, hypotension in setting of diuresis, and worsening acute on chronic renal insufficiency.
The patient has a history of multiple admissions to [**Hospital **] for CHF and COPD exacerbation and was recently discharged to [**Hospital 25576**] Rehabilitation Center on [**2147-5-30**] after hospitalization for one such episode.
At the rehab facility he was noted to have progressively worsening dyspnea, lower extremity edema, and orthopnea/paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
The initial exam was notable for bibasilar crackles and severe bilateral LE edema with BNP of 2620 (unclear baseline), felt to be c/w CHF exacerbation, for which he was given IV lasix boluses.
With diuresis he developed asymptomatic hypotension (SBP 50s to 90s) and was transferred to the ICU.
He had evidence of a UTI on admission UA so was started on ceftriaxone.
Chest X-ray reported possible right base infiltrate with effusion so this was broadened to levaquin and ceftriaxone.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

#Acute on Chronic systolic Heart failure/Dyspnea: Patient was initally treated for HCAP at OSH but this was stopped given his CXR was without evidence of infiltrates.
Patient volume overloaded on exam with elevated BNP.
He was diuresed for acute on chronic systolic heart failure with lasix gtt.
EP was also consulted for possible biv upgrade of patient's ICD as he was 90% RV pacing with widened QRS.
Patient's ICD was interogated and revealed underlying sinus rhythm with 1:1 AV conduction.
Atrial Fibrillation: Confirmed with outpatient cardiologist that patient had been on coumadin and was in favor of restarting this.
EP consulted as stated above, pacer interrogated showing underlying sinus with 1:1 AV conduction.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Creatine improved with diuresis; diovan restarted later on his hospital course.
# Elevated LFTs: Improved with diuresis, likely hepatic congestion secondary to acute on chronic heart failure.
# Diabetes: Continued NPH and sliding scale.
#SUBCLINICAL HYPOTHYROIDISM: Noted to have elevated TSH w/ normal T4 at OSH.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 25759**] & Rehab Center - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute on Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure Coronary Artery Disease Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation Acute on chronic Kidney Disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You had another episode of congestive heart failure and needed to be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for low blood pressure.
You did not have a urinary tract infection here.
You will return to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] next month to discuss a revision of your pacemaker that may help with the congestive heart failure.
We started you on coumadin to prevent blood clots and stroke with your irregular heart beat.
Start Torsemide to prevent fluid overload 4.
