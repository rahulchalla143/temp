ST. VINCENTS   History of Present Illness: This is a 63 year old female who presented to [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 6783**] Hospital with acute onset of headache this morning.
Headache was accompanied with nausea and vomiting.
A head CT out [**Hospital3 **] showed diffuse SAH within the basal cisterns and intraventricular hemorrhage.
Neuro: Intubated, sedated with propofol but held pt intermittently follows commands on the right side intermittently Moves left side less spontaneously but w/d to noxious stimuli, [**Month/Day (3) 2994**] [**1-1**], no dolls eye, + corneals, + gag, face appears symmetric Babinski is extensor on the right, flexor on the left  Exam on discharge: AOx3, [**Last Name (LF) 2994**], [**First Name3 (LF) 2995**] w/full motor   Pertinent Results: [**2132-6-27**] CTA Head/Neck: CT HEAD: There is extensive bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage, stable from prior study at 9 a.m.
There is a small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage in bilateral occipital horns, which is new compared to the prior study.
There is a right frontal approach ventricular catheter, terminating in the third ventricle with a small amount of likely post-operative pneumocephalus.
There is no shift of the normally midline structures.
There is fluid in the nasal and oropharyngeal cavities, likely from intubation.
The visualized portion of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
NECK CTA: There is a three-vessel aortic arch.
The neck carotid and vertebral arteries are patent, with no evidence of stenosis.
There is mild non-calcified atherosclerotic plaquing of the right carotid artery at the bifurcation.
CTA OF THE HEAD: There is an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery, which measures 4.5 mm in diameter, as well as an aneurysm of the left middle cerebral artery at the bifurcation measuring 5.5 mm.
Intracranial internal carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches appear patent without evidence of occlusion.
There is a hypoplastic left A1 segment of the left anterior cerebral artery.
The basilar artery is diminutive because of bilateral robust posterior communicating arteries.
Bilateral extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage, with now small amount of bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage in the occipital horns when compared to prior study from [**2132-6-27**] at 9 a.m.
There is no associated mass effect.
Aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery measuring 4.5 mm in diameter and aneurysm of the left middle cerebral artery at the bifurcation measuring 5.5 mm in diameter.
Hypoplastic left A1 segment of the ACA and a diminutive basilar artery because of bilateral robust posterior communicating arteries.
Mild plaquing of the right carotid artery at the bifurcation, without any flow-limiting stenosis.
[**2132-6-28**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: Redemonstration of unchanged intracranial hemorrhage and interval placement of endovascular emoblization coils.
There is evidence of further ventricular dilatation over the 11-hour interval, most evident in the lateral ventricular frontal and temporal horns, with ventriculostomy catheter abuting the floor of the III ventricle.
Stable volume and distribution of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Slight interval decrease in ventricular dilatation, compared to study performed 10.5 hours earlier.
Slight redistribution of intraventricular blood products, though the overall volume appears unchanged.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Expected interval evolution and redistribution of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres.
New foci of hyperdensity in the sulci at the vertex could be related to redistribution of existing blood products; however, new hemorrhage cannot be excluded and attention on followup is recommended.
A CXR was performed because of her fever the night prior, which showed no pneumonia.
3. aspirin 325 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for post angio for 1 months.
