ECHO [**11-12**]: IMPRESSION: Large, circumferential pericardial effusion with brief right atrial diastolic collapse consistent with possible early pericardial tamponade.
Acute pericardial tamponade.
Persistently elevated filling pressures post-pericardiocentesis consistent with restrictive-constrictive physiology.
CXR Portable [**11-12**]: IMPRESSION: Interval development of severe cardiomegaly, findings concerning for a new pericardial effusion.
There is no echo evidence of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: 27 yo male hx pericarditis in [**Month (only) **] with intermittent URI sx now with pericardial effusion and tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis and drainage.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES: .
# Viral Pericarditis c/b Pericardial Effusion and Tamponade: Mr. [**Known lastname 54135**] was admitted for syncope due to pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology (per ECHO)secondary to a ~2 weeks of pericarditis thought to be viral in nature due to a ~4 week severe viral prodrome.
He went to the cath lab for pericardiocentesis for placement of a drain with removal of, per report, 1.1 L of straw colored fluid and resolution of his symptoms.
Studies were c/w exudative process.
His pericardial fluid cultures were negative but 1 set that was injected into a blood culture bottle grew GPC's in pairs and chains although he did not have any clinical signs or symptoms of infection.
His [**Doctor First Name **] and TSH were wnl's and prelim review of his pericardial fluid cytology was negative for malignant or atypical cells.
His drain was removed and he had another ECHO the following day which showed a small amount of residual fluid but no significant re-accumulation.
#The fluid from his pericardial space was sent for cytology which was pending at the time of discharge, this should be followed-up to ensure there are no aytpical cells in need of further workup.
#There were gram + cocci in pairs and clusters growing in one set of his pericardial fluid cultures.
He did not have any signs or symptoms of infection at the time of discharge and this was felt to be contamination rather than indicative of infection.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Viral pericarditis complicated by pericardial tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation and treatment of shortness of breath, fatigue, and passing out in your bathroom.
You were found to have a large amount of fluid around your heart.
You underwent a pericardiocentesis with drainage of the fluid and your symptoms improved dramatically.
We believe this happened due to viral pericarditis and we are giving you medications to prevent the fluid from re-accumulating.
One of the cultures from the fluid taken from around your heart grew bacteria but given the fact that you are feeling well, have no fevers, and no other laboratory evidence of infection we feel this is likely contamination of the culture (your other culture was negative).
We also tested you for thyroid problems and autoimmune disease but both of these tests were normal.
The following changes have been made to your medications: -START Ibuprofen 200mg tabs 3 tabs by mouth as needed for pain (Please do not take more than 2400 grams daily, you can take less if you feel it is enough for your pain) -START Colchicine 0.6mg by mouth twice daily (You will take this medication for at least 6 months to prevent the fluid around your heart from coming back) .
If you develop fevers, shortness of breath, chest pain, or weakness/fatigue reminiscent of pericarditis or fluid around your heart please seek medical care immediately.
