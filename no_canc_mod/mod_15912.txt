The patient was originally transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] with right lower extremity edema and pain found to be secondary to compartment syndrome.
This had begun on _______ status post a heavy drinking binge with questionable deep venous thrombosis or trauma leading to increasing tissue destruction over the next weeks which was progressive and resulting in fasciotomy.
Fasciotomy led to worsening of the patient's coagulopathy with decrease in platelets and red blood cell counts and increase of INR, PT, PTT, SBP, d-DIMER, although normal factor 8.
Probable DIC combined with ARS from rhabdomyolysis led to uremia and increased platelet dysfunction which led to chronic bleeding from fasciotomies.
Of note, the patient's initial acute renal failure was most likely secondary to a tension/prerenal state and then worsened with prolonged myoglobinemia.
In the setting of chronic bleeding, the patient required transfusions and progressive DIC and encephalopathy and it was decided to take the patient for above-the-knee amputation.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for alcohol cirrhosis status post upper GI bleed, sphincterectomy secondary to motor vehicle accident and peripheral vein thrombosis.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 47-year-old Portugese man with cirrhosis, compartment syndrome, status post right above-the-knee amputation.
Mental status:  The patient is very somnolent after admission to Medicine Service and was nonverbal.
The patient had somewhat elevated sodium to 148 and was given free water boluses to decrease sodium.
The patient's oxycodone was also decreased while the intravenous morphine was kept on for pain control.
The patient was also continued on lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy.
His CT was considered as no improvement.
For the end-stage liver disease the Hepatology Service the patient was receiving Aldactone for diaphoresis, Pentasa, __________ and ursodiol.
The patient had ascites but never received a therapeutic tap.
The patient continued to diurese with Aldactone and free water boluses were given for the elevated sodium.
Hematology:  The patient was not given any more fresh frozen plasma after the MICU stay.
No vegetation.
On the early morning of [**2106-1-19**], a code was called at midnight after the patient was found unresponsive without respirations or pulse having vomited his tube feeds.
The patient had a complex medical history including end-stage liver disease.
This was complicated with compartment syndrome, hypernatremia and renal failure.
The patient at that time had been tachypneic and poorly responsive.
On initial examination the patient was pulseless, no respiration.
