Over past week, has had RUQ pain that has resolved spontaneously.
However, yesterday, patient developed sharp and unremitting RUQ pain, radiating to the back, worse than 10 out of 10 pain, accompanied by nausea although no frank vomiting and has subsequently avoided taking any POs.
Laboratory studies in the ED were notable for normal chem 7, normal PT/PTT/INR at 11.9/31/1.1, no leukocytosis at 10.6, hematocrit of 44.8, and lactate 1.0.
CXR was performed, which was benign, with clear lung fields, normal cardiomediastinal silhouette, and normal osseus and soft tissue structures.
CT abdomen was also performed, with wet read suggesting small pneumobilia (suggesting instrumentation), no intrahepatic bile, and CBD diltation to 14 mm (which can be seen after cholecystectomy).
Finally, RUQ US was performed, with wet read suggesting hepatic steatosis (due to echogenic liver), prominence of CBD without intrahepatic biliary dilitation c/w post-CCY status.
Then was found to have heart rate dropping to 30s (transiently) and also with respiratory depression.
On transfer from the ED, VS were: 98.0 54 150/95 10 99%  On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS. 98.2 54 159/95 12 96% RA  Pain currently is in same location in RUQ.
Pain is [**7-8**], sharp in character.

No visualized free air is seen below the diaphragm.
IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change since prior, no visualized air below the diaphragm.
No liver abscess or CT evidence of cholangitis.
Left hepatic lobe pneumobilia with air in the CBD compatibel with prior spincterotomy.
Probably focally dilated duct in hepatic segment V versus portal venous thrombosis.
Mildly enlarged porta hepatic lymph nodes.
Left renal lower pole 1-cm exophytic hyperdense lesion with peripheral hyperdensity.
Mildly echogenic liver, likely due to technical factors.
Mild prominence of the CBD likely relates to the post-cholecystectomy status.

# RUQ PAIN: Patient's RUQ pain was attributed likely [**3-1**] biliary obstruction vs. cholangitis.
There was low suspicion for cholangitis with normal LFTs, normal bili, lack of fever, or jaundice.
The CT scan showed common bile duct dilitation compatable with prior cholecystectomy.
The patient also underwent MRCP which showed no stones in the CBD or pancreatic duct.
The patient was not treated with antibiotic therapy as there was no evidence of active infection.
The patient's pain resolved without inetervention, he was able to tolerate a regular diet prior to discharge.
# BRADYCARDIC EPISODE: Patient with bradycardic episode in ED.
This was though to be secondary to dilaudid, combination with exaggerated vagal activity with nausea/vomiting.
Patient had no further episodes.
#RENAL CYSTS: - the patient had evidence of renal cysts on his CT-- these were characterized as cysts on MRI.
