Admission Date:  [**2124-1-16**]              Discharge Date:   [**2124-1-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2040-3-28**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7015**] Chief Complaint: seizures, confusion  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**1-16**]: Intubation for airway protection [**1-17**]: Failed extubation, then re-intubation [**1-20**]: Successful extubation  History of Present Illness: In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 4640**] is an 83 year old male with past medical history significant for HTN, HL, MI s/p CABG, atrial fibrillation, dCHF (EF>55%), borderline DM, and mild COPD who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] TICU after onset of seizures of unclear etiology.
EMS took patient to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where code stroke called and patient had a brief second repeat seizure that was effectively treated with IV Ativan.
[**1-16**] MRI head also showed no acute infarcts but evidence of chronic small vessel ischemic disease and volume loss noted.
Neurology team felt that patient's history and exam was most consistent with a post-ictal [**Doctor Last Name 555**] paralysis verus CVA or infection.
Since patient was admitted he has been stable on Keppra therapy with no repeat seizures thus far.
He initially remained intubated in TICU after admission for airway protection and extubated on [**1-17**] but then required repeat intubation after he had notable dyspnea, generous yellowish sputum production and desaturations to high 80s range.
Extubated successfully on [**1-20**] and now comfortable at 93% O2 Saturations but continues to have mild cough and fevers.
Mr. [**Known lastname 4640**] was transferred to the neurology service on [**1-20**] and additional workup has been limited from a neurological standpoint with no clear cause for his seizures to date.
On [**1-21**] he had episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR to 120s per neuro team but this resolved after IV metoprolol and he has since been well controlled on higher oral metoprolol dose of 75mg TID ; up from his usual home atenolol dosing.
He is being transferred to medicine service now for further management due to more complicated hospital course which has evolved and includes complicated HAP/VAP, intermittent atrial fibrillation with RVR, hyponatremia, worse anemia and ongoing fevers.
[**1-17**] Sputum Culture grew out Moraxella catarrhalis and he has been continued on IV ceftriaxone and Azithromycin (started [**1-18**]) and .
He appears to be in no apparent distress at rest and is fully alert and oriented now.
Past Medical History: -Hypertension -Hyperlipidemia -s/p MI and 5 vessel CABG in [**2114**] -paroxysmal atrial fibrillation -diastolic CHF -borderline DM -BPH -mild COPD  Social History: Lives at home with his wife in [**Name (NI) 1727**].

This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method, please refer to       hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..     FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2124-1-19**]):    NO GROWTH.
The bibasilar atelectasis has improved.
There are unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax is identified.
Small bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged.
CXR [**2124-1-26**]: FINDINGS: Retrocardiac opacity has slightly worsened since [**2124-1-24**] and likely reflects left lower lobe collapse.
Blunting of the left costodiaphragmatic angle and is most likely a small left pleural effusion.
New right lower lobe hazy opacity in the right lower lobe is new and may represent an acute pneumonia.
Midline sternotomy wires are and healed left posterior rib fractures are also stable, the cardiac size is normal.
New right lower lobe opacity, which could reflect aspiration or developing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
Possible small right effusion.
Left lower lobe atelectasis and small left pleural effusion have worsened since [**2124-1-24**].
[**2124-1-18**] MR cervical spine: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of fracture or compression deformity.
There is elevated STIR signal within the C5-6 intervertebral disc.
There is no prevertebral edema, there is no high STIR signal in the ligamentous structures.
There is fluid in the oral cavity and nasopharynx through hypopharynx in the setting of intubation and nasogastric tube.
Partially imaged is mucosal disease in the maxillary sinuses with air-fluid levels and mastoid effusions.
There is no thyroid focal lesion.
There is multilevel cervical spondylosis.
At C3-4, disc bulge, endplate and facet arthropathy cause moderate canal stenosis, remodeling the ventral cord and moderate bilateral neural foraminal stenosis.
At C4-5, disc bulge and uncovertebral and facet arthropathy cause moderate canal stenosis and moderate-to-severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis.
At C5-6, the same factors cause severe canal stenosis, remodeling the cord and severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis.
At C6-7, the same factors cause moderate canal stenosis and moderate left and mild right neural foraminal stenosis.
There is grade 1 anterolisthesis of C7 on T1 with mild uncovering of the disc.
There is mild canal and neural foraminal stenosis.
No evidence of ligamentous injury or cord contusion.
High signal within the C5-6 intervertebral disc is probably related to degenerative change.
Traumatic disc injury and/or infection/inflammation could also have a similar appearance, and clinical correlation is recommended.
[**2124-1-18**] CT head without contrast: FINDINGS: There is no evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, edema, or hydrocephalus.
Extensive periventricular, deep and subcortical white matter hypodensity is likely secondary to chronic small vessel ischemic disease, similar to prior.
A tiny focal hypodensity in the left head of the caudate is better seen on the current study due to differences in positioning, consistent with a chronic lacunar infarct.
There is evidence of bilateral cataract surgery.
There is increased fluid in the paranasal sinuses, and persistent nasopharyngeal fluid, likely secondary to endotracheal and nasogastric intubation, as well as prolonged supine positioning.
Underpneumatization of the right mastoid air cells is again seen, likely secondary to prior chronic infections.
Unchanged appearance of the brain without evidence for an acute intracranial process.
Increased fluid in the paranasal sinuses, which could be secondary to endotracheal and nasogastric intubation, as well as prolonged supine positioning.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No systolic prolapse or discrete vegetation is seen (does not exclude as images are suboptimal).
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with mildly thickened leaflets.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
EEG [**2124-1-17**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable routine EEG due to the presence of a disorganized background composed of generally slow  frequencies.
This is consistent with a mild diffuse encephalopathy possibly caused by medications, infection, toxic/metabolic disturbances, or other causes.
There were no focal or epileptiform features during this recording.
MRI head with and without contrast [**2124-1-16**]: FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarct.
There is extensive, confluent white matter FLAIR-signal abnormality, compatible with sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
There is moderate prominence of the ventricles and sulci, representing global atrophy.
There is diffuse thickening, signal abnormality, and enhancement within the dura raising the possibility of intracranial hypotension.
There is no abnormal parenchymal enhancement after gadolinium.
There are maxillary sinus and sphenoid air cell fluid levels and opacification of nearly all the ethmoidal air cells.
There is also a right mastoid effusion.
No acute infarct.
Evidence of chronic small vessel ischemic disease and atrophy.
Diffuse dural thickening and enhancement, most suggestive of intracranial hypotension, which may relate to LP performed earlier in the day.
CTA head with and without contrast with perfusion analysis [**2124-1-16**]: CONCLUSION: Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications of the intra- and extra-cranial vasculature.
No perfusion abnormalities to raise the question of acute brain ischemia.
COMMENT: There is moderately prominent spinal stenosis identified due to a posterior spondylytic ridge at the C5-6 level, with associated uncovertebral spurring causing prominent bilateral foraminal stenosis.
A more shallow posterior spondylytic ridge and uncovertebral spurring is noted at C6-7.
Brief Hospital Course: In summary, this is an 83yo male with history of HTN, MI, dCHF, mild COPD who was transferred for acute onset seizures of unclear etiology despite extensive neurological and infectious workup to date who has had complicated hospital course with new PNA, hyponatremia, anemia, atrial fibrillation, and COPD exacerbation.
#Seizures:  Patient without prior history of any seizure disorders prior to admission.
Imaging with head CT/CTA and MRI show no evidence of any bleeds, traumas, new infarcts to blame CVA event for his seizure activity.
EEG done [**1-17**] showed mild diffuse encephalopathy but no focal or epileptiform features.
He initially had a right sided weakness in the shoulder which has been attributed to post-ictal Todds Paralysis effects which improved to just some mild right shoulder weakness.
#PNA: Patient had [**1-17**] fevers to 102F and new sputum production with sputum growing out Moraxella.
On [**2123-03-28**] when he had only 2 days of Ceftriaxone treatment left he became tachypnic and his CXR showed a new RLL.
A bed side speech and swallow evaluation was negative for aspiration.
# Mild COPD exacerbation: Pt's breathing has appeared somewhat labored during entire hospitalization but better on the day of discharge.
Pt with decreased breath sounds and wheeze on exam.
Prior fevers likely from PNA vs. UTI source.
He had a UA on [**1-17**] that grew coag negative staph but repeat UA on [**2124-1-24**] showed no pyuria and his urine cx returned with mixed bacterial flora.
On [**2124-1-17**] he had a single bottle blood cx + for coag negative staph on [**1-17**] that was thought to be a contaminant.
#Hyponatremia: He became hyponatremic to as low as 126.
This was thought to be secondary to hypovolemia given FENA of 0.9% and contracted labs with elevated BUN.
A mild SIADH or other pre-renal causes is also a possibility.
#Atrial fibrillation: He had a know history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with recent A fib with RVR episode on [**1-21**].
#HTN:  His atenolol was discontinued and his metoprolol was uptitrated as above for A fib rate control.
His HCTZ was stopped indefinately for hyponatremia.
#CAD/hyperliidemia: No evidence of any new ischemic changes on recent EKG.
Old infarct seen on EKG.
Longstanding HTN is likely cause for his mild diastolic congestion.

COPD exacerbation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You required intubation or a breathing tube for a few days to protect your airway.
You had a very thorough workup with the neurology service which included MRI imaging of your brain, CT/CTA scans of your head and neck, electrical studies of the brain (EEG), and a lumbar tap of your spine was done to examine cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) for any concerning malignancies, meningitis or other infections.
All of these studies were unrevealing for a clear cause of your seizures.
[**Street Address(1) 87767**] BECAUSE YOU HAD AN UNEXPLAINED SEIZURE.
During your hospital course you also developed fevers, shortness of breath and a productive cough which was attributed to new pneumonias which can sometimes occur following intubation.
(Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 87768**] as an outpatient to ensure your pneumonia has fully resolved.
We also started you on steroids as we feel you have a mild COPD exacerbation.
Your hospital stay was also significant for an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation which is a rapid irregular heart rate which you have had in the past as well.
Heart rates are now in normal ranges but you were asked to increase your usual aspirin to higher dose of 325mg daily because atrial fibrillation is a risk for stroke and aspirin will be protective for this risk.
The following medications were started: -Cefepime 2g IV q24hrs for 6 days for pneumonia -Vancomycin 1250mg IV every 12 hrs for 6 days for pneumonia -Amlodipine 7.5mg daily for blood pressure control -Albuterol nebs q4hr prn shortness of breath or wheeze -Ferrous sulfate 325mg after dinner for iron deficiency -keppra 1000mg po twice a day for seizure prevention -Metoprolol succinate XL 300mg daily for heart rate control -senna, colace, miralax for constipation -prednisone 40mg daily for 3 more days -heparin sc 5000 units TID .
