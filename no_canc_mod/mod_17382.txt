No intervention was attempted.
Postoperatively, she was somewhat hypotensive and anemic, so a fluid bolus was given and a blood transfusion attempted.
However, soon after starting the blood transfusion she became rigorous, acutely hypotensive, and temporarily developed stridor with decreased O2 sats that resolved spontaneously.
The blood bank was notified of a possible transfusion reaction, and a complete workup was performed which turned out negative for transfusion reaction.
Her right foot was much warmer postsurgery, and she developed a strong palpable pulse of her right foot, as well as a dopplerable PT signal.
By POD4 she was tolerating a regular diet, her pain was controlled, and her incisions were healing nicely.
