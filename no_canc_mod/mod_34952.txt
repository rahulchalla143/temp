Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY This is a 34 yo M w/ hx ESRD on HD, HTN, medication non-compliance, substance abuse, and multiple recent hospital admissions for CP who presented to the ED after an episode of CP and was found to be hyperkalemic to 8.1, and subsequently had an episode of monomorphic Vtach, with sustained pressures.
On the floor, his EKG's showed persistent repolarization abnormalities that were sufficiently concerning that we kept him an extra night.
We reviewed the EKG's and the consensus was that these abnormalities, which crossed territories and occurred in the absence of symptoms, were related to the resolving electrolyte disturbance of his presentation.
# Ventricular Tachycardia: Occured in the setting of hyperkalemia.
Resolved with electrolyte normalization but left him with subtle repolarization abnormalities.
# Hypertension Held home anti-hypertensives this evening as Pt is being dialyzed.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for Constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY Hyperkalemia Ventricular Tachycardia  SECONDARY ESRD on HD HTN Substance Abuse   Discharge Condition: afebrile, ambulating, tolerating regular diet   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for chest pain and abnormal heart rhythm.
