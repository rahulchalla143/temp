In [**2163-7-7**] he had an episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation for which he was admitted to EMMC, and at that time he had an echocardiogram which showed severe mitral regurgitation.
He complains of a 12 pound wt gain in 12 days, and 3+ bilateral ankle edema.
Since the initiation of medications he denies any further symptoms of weight gain or bilateral ankle edema.
He can walk up to two miles with experiencing shortness of breath.
Cardiac catheteterization showed ramus disease and referred for surgery.

Minimal aortic arch calcification, predominately at the arch.
No aneurysmal dilatation.
Coronary artery disease.
[**2168-3-2**] Echo: Prebypass: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate/severe posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a new bioprosthetic valve which is well-seated in the mitral position.
There is no evidence of regurgitation or stenosis (peak gradient 4 mmHg with a CO of 3.8 L/min).
There is a new tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring with no evidence of stenosis of regurgitation.
Overall left ventricular function is now moderately depressed (LVEF = 35-40%) with paradoxical septal motion from V-pacing.
Remained in CVICU for management of his chronic atrial fibrillation and blood pressure control but was transferred to the step-down floor later on post-op day one.
He had possible evidence of complete heart block with question need for pacemaker but this was deemed not necessary by EP.
