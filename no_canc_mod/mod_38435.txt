LENI'S [**2197-7-28**]:  FINDINGS:  Grayscale, color and Doppler images were obtained of bilateral common femoral, femoral, popliteal, and posterior tibial veins.
Normal flow, compression, and augmentation is seen in all of the visualized veins.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute deep vein thrombosis seen in either leg.
Note is made that the left peroneal veins could not be visualized perhaps due to chronic/prior thrombosis.
Brief Hospital Course: 42 yo female PMH of NASH cirrhosis, s/p gastric  bypass presentes with tylenol OD resulting in transaminitis as well as elevated amylase and lipase which are now trending down.
# Acute Liver failure secondary to tylenol overdose: Pt initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] with diffuse abdominal pain reportedly in the setting of taking over 30 tablets of tylenol.
Tox screen positive for methadone and opiates, negative for alcohol.

Her pancytopenia was likely in the setting of her acute illness.
This was held in house given her coagulopathy from her acute liver injury.
LENIs showed no acute DVT, but left peroneal vein could not be visualized suggesting a chronic clot.
# Transitional Issues -Pt to discuss further pain management plan with PCP [**Name10 (NameIs) 30412**] to discuss anticoagulation plan for prior DVT with PCP [**Name10 (NameIs) 30412**] should have repeat CBC the week after discharge to ensure marrow recovery -Pt to follow up with hepatologist Dr. [**Name (STitle) 23173**] on [**8-28**].
