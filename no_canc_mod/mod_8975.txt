Admission Date:  [**2189-4-1**]       Discharge Date:  [**2189-4-15**]  Date of Birth:   [**2131-8-12**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder and coronary artery disease, who was brought into the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Room on [**2189-4-1**] secondary to confusion.
Patient's electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia at 112, inferior lead Q waves, and mild ST depression in lead V5.
In addition, the patient was noted to have an [**Hospital1 **] white blood cell count of 17.4, but was noted to be afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
The patient continued to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status in the Emergency Department, after which point he received head CT scan which was negative and a lumbar puncture which demonstrated 560 red blood cells and 1 white blood cell.
A bedside echocardiogram was performed, which demonstrated hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of approximately 30% and 2+ mitral regurgitation.
Although the patient reported having no memory of the days events, he did report being under a fair amount of increased stress over the past several days secondary to his car being stolen and him running out of his standard home medications.
Coronary artery disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Reports a remote history of alcohol abuse, but states the last drink was in [**2170**].
Given the patient's presenting symptoms and his lumbar puncture results, a neurosurgical consult was obtained and the patient was referred for head MRI/MRA which subsequently demonstrated no gross structural abnormalities and no evidence of infarction or intracranial enhancement.
Given the patient's negative head scan and markedly improved mental status with little intervention, the leading diagnosis for his acute mental status change was believed to be a postictal state.
The patient was subsequently advised to remain on an one-to-one sitter for risk of elopement, and Ativan standing dosage was recommended given the potential for the patient to go into benzodiazepine withdrawal.
While on the floor, the patient demonstrated several episodes of acute shortness of breath and tachypnea subsequently ascribed to transient panic attacks that the patient stated were consistent with his normal baseline.
On [**2189-4-3**], the patient underwent a repeat echocardiogram, which demonstrated severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with an estimated ejection fraction of 25% and 4% mitral regurgitation.
The patient subsequently recommended for a cardiac catheterization, which he underwent on [**2189-4-6**], which subsequently demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease with 70% proximal irregular stenosis of the left anterior descending artery, total occlusion of the circumflex, and total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery.
In addition, the patient's cardiac catheterization demonstrated moderate right ventricular diastolic dysfunction, severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, moderate primary pulmonary hypertension, and a depressed cardiac index of 1.8.
On [**2189-4-8**], the patient therefore underwent a coronary artery bypass graft using anastomosis from the LIMA to the LAD, and a mitral annuloplasty using a 28 mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] ring.
In the CSRU, the patient's IAVP remained in place through postoperative day #2, at which point it was removed without complication.
The patient demonstrated a gradual respiratory wean, and was finally successfully extubated on postoperative day #3 without complication.
Physical Therapy consultation was obtained, and the patient was cleared for discharge to home following resolution of his acute medical issues.
The patient demonstrated several additional episodes of anxiety attacks through the course of his time on the regular patient floor, all of which responded well to Ativan administration.
Patient's Foley catheter was subsequently removed without complication.
On postoperative day #6, a routine chest radiograph demonstrated evidence of a left basilar infiltrate versus atelectasis; the patient was subsequently begun on levofloxacin for a 10 day course to be completed as an outpatient.
