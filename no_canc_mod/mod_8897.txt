**FINAL REPORT [**2193-7-27**]**     MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2193-7-27**]):    No MRSA isolated.
The lungs are clear of focal consolidation or effusion.
Osseous and soft tissue structures are unchanged noting significant degenerative changes at the right glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant systeme  demonstrated two-vessel coronary artery disease.
The LCx had minimal luminal irregularities.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial hypertension.

Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade I (mild) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Elevated estimated intracardiac filling pressures and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION: 81 yo F w/ PMH of HTN, HLP and PMR who presents from home with 6 weeks of chest pain, found to ahve an NSTEMI.
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES: # NSTEMI: Patient came in with NSTEMI with no obvious changes on her EKG, but had chest pain x 6 weeks and her troponin increased from 0.02-->0.11 in the ED.
She went to the cath lab and underwent a left heart cath which showed 90% occlusion of the proximal LAD, RCA total occlusion and OM disease.
She developed bradycardia and required a dose of atropine with resolution.
She had [**9-20**] chest pain during this event.
She was monitored in the CCU overnight, and had no further chest pain or EKG changes.
She was then transferred back to the floor, where she was monitored for an additional night with no complications.
She was initially started on metoprolol tartrate 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], but developed bradycardia to 40s-50s, so was discharged on metoprolol sucinate 12.5mg daily.
#) Hypertensive emergency:  Patient was initially hypertensive in ED on presentation, consistent with hypertensive emergency in setting of NSTEMI.
Patient reports weakness especially in legs, but hip flexors on exam were 5/5 strength; mild weakness was found in deltoids.
ProAir HFA *NF* (albuterol sulfate) 90 mcg/actuation Inhalation q4h  prn shortness of breath/wheezing 9.
ProAir HFA *NF* (albuterol sulfate) 90 mcg/actuation Inhalation q4h  prn shortness of breath/wheezing 12.
Discharge Diagnosis: Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction Hypertensive Emergency   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were admitted for chest pain concerning for a heart attack.
During the catheterization, we found that 3 of your major arteries around your heart were blocked.
