Patient reports increased dyspnea for the past several days which progressively worsened on the day of admission.
She laid in bed most of the day and when she finally got out of bed, she noted severe dyspnea and came to the ED.
She reports no dietary indiscretion (she did the [**Holiday 1451**] cooking) and has not missed any of her lasix doses.
She denies any fever, chills, cough, sputum production, or hemoptysis.
Of note the patient was recently changed from verapamil 120 mg daily (started two months ago) to diltiazem 120 mg daily due to increased dyspnea.
She states that when she originally started verapamil, she had more dyspnea and this has been stable for the past few months.
CXR demonstrated small bilateraly effusions and ?
She was then treated with lasix 60 mg IV X 1 after CXR demonstrated pulmonary edema.
She denies any chest pain.
She chronically sleeps with her head elevated due to her reflux disease; she states she wakes from sleep short of breath "sometimes" but has not noted this any more frequently lately.
She reports some decreased urine output for the past few days but denies any recent chest pain or diaphoresis.
She denies dysuria, headache, nasal congestion, sore throat, abdominal pain, hematuria, or increased LE edema.
She had one episode of diarrhea in the past few days after taking laxatives.

HEENT: Sclerae injected bilaterally, PERRL, EOMI, MMM, tongue midline NECK: supple, no LAD, prominent EJ up to angle of mandible CV: RRR, normal S1 & S2 with prominent S4, 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at apex LUNGS: decreased breath sounds bilaterally with poor air movement, prominent scoliosis with barrel chest ABD: firm but nontender, hypoactive bowel sounds EXT: warm, no peripheral edema, DP pulses 2+ bilaterally SKIN: No rashes/lesions, ecchymoses.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2162-11-24**] no change.
CHF, bilateral pleural effusions.
Retrocardiac opacity, which could represent a combination of atelectasis and hiatal hernia.
Cannot rule out consolidation.
Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
Mild congestive failure.
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 80571**] is a 68 year old woman with a past medical history notable for severe kyphoscoliosis, diastolic CHF, and reactive and restrictive lung disease who presented with shortness of breath and a CHF exacerbation.
# Shortness of breath / acute on chronic CHF: The patient requires 3L O2 at home to maintain O2 sats 88-92% and desats with ambulation at baseline.
EKG showed no evidence of new ischemia and cardiac enzymes x 2 were negative.
She had an elevated BNP of 7885, CXR with bilateral pleural effusions, and ECHO with worsened RVH.
# Acute renal failure: Creatinine was elevated to 1.7 on admission and initially felt to be related to poor forward flow in setting of initiation of diltiazem and/or CHF exacerbation.
# Hypernatremia: On admisison the patient reported one episode of diarrhea after taking laxatives during the week prior, but otherwise no good explanation for hypernatremia.
# Leukopenia: Near baseline and is chronic.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Tylenol 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every six (6) hours as needed for fever or pain: Not to exceed 4 grams in 24 hours.
Acute renal failure  Secondary Diagnoses: 1.
Severe kyphoscoliosis 2.
Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile, satting in the mid to low 90s on 3L O2.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of shortness of breath and increased oxygen requirement.
On admission, you were also found to have some kidney dysfunction, however, that has improved back to normal with removal of the extra fluid.
Please call your physician or return to the hospital if you develop worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, fevers, or any other concerning symptoms.
