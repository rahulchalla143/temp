FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
Bibasilar airspace consolidation, findings suggestive of pneumonia or aspiration.
Large indirect left inguinal hernia, with small and large bowel along with mesenteric fat identified within the left hemiscrotum.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease.
No definite hydronephrosis in the right kidney.
There are bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
There is bibasilar atelectasis.
Left lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged.
There is no evidence of interval development of new consolidations.
Bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present.
Liver/gallbladder ultrasound [**6-16**] The gallbladder wall is mildly thickened however this is likely related to it being partially collapsed.
No pericholecystic fluid is present.
There is no biliary dilatation.
No focal liver abnormality is present.
No evidence of gallstones or cholecystitis.
Pulmonary parenchymal collapse, bilateral diffuse infiltrates and left-sided free layering pleural effusion.
Multiple chronic findings as described above.
However, there is no finding to suggest an etiology for this patient's liver function abnormalities or leukocytosis.
Multiple chronic findings include anasarca, atherosclerotic disease, bilateral probable nephrolithiasis, adrenal adenomas, and degenerative disc and degenerative joint disease of the spine.
Diffuse permeative appearance of the bony structures.
CXR [**6-23**] Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion has increased, obscuring much of the left lung where there could be either asymmetric edema or pneumonia, both worsened since the previous examination.
Also increased is mediastinal widening suggesting elevated central venous pressure or volume.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE [**Age over 90 **]yo M w anoxic brain injury, ventilator-dependent who presented initially with respiratory failure [**2-11**] bilateral pneumonia, status post 14-day antibiotics course with respiratory status at [**Month/Day (2) 5348**], course complicated by renal failure, with decreasing hematocrit likely secondary to chronic GI bleed and anemia of chronic disease, funguria status post foley change, with worsening uremia.
# Acute on Chronic Respiratory Failure: Patient p/w leukocytosis, CXR demonstrating bilateral pneumonia, cultures growing pseudomonas.
Of note, patient also grew multiple GNR bacteria out of later respiratory cultures, however, elected not to treat this given the fact that he was afebrile, and that his ventilator requirements and secretions were stable.
# Acute Renal Failure/Electrolyte disturbance: Patient was admitted with Creatinine of 5.5 ([**Month/Day (2) 5348**] of 1.8) and a significant acidemia (pH 7.04), thought to be [**2-11**] [**Last Name (un) **] in the setting of sepsis complicated by ATN.
Per discussion with renal service, patient was not a candidate for HD given underlying severe medical comorbidities.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and other attendings including Drs [**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] met with the family on several occasions to discuss the implications of his progressive renal failure, including the eventual cardiac instability that would result from untreated uremia, hyperkalemia and acidosis.
Electrolyte disturbances were managed medically.
He was also noted to have worsening uremia and hyponatremia.
Telemetry showed repeated bouts of prolonged pauses and brady-tachy rhythms on starting [**2189-6-20**], most likely thought to be due to uremia.
# C. difficile: on [**6-12**] the pt's WBC was noted to have started to increase.
However, his WBC persisted as did ongoing issues with diarrhea and loose stools consistent with severe c. diff.
# Anemia: Pt w several episodes of melenotic stool over the course of the admission, with slow trending down of Hct, requiring 10 units PRBC during the course of admission.
There were never signs of acute bleeding and he remained hemodynamically stable on IV Pantoprazole.
His HCT trended down gradually over time probably from frequent phlebotomy and decreased production given worsened renal failure.
However, given transfusion would not reverse his grim prognosis in the setting of worsening renal failure, no transfusion was given.
# Diabetes Mellitus II: His home glipizide was stopped given renal failure initially.
Glipizide was restarted when renal failure stabilized by family request at 2.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
# Atrial fibrillation: Pt had episodes of atrial fibrillation.
Pt had episodes of tachycardia which responded well to diltiazem which was eventually titrated to 45mg QID.
At times, he would have bradycardia down to the 20s-30s with associated hypotension.
# Urinary tract infection: Patient with positive UA on admission for ESBL sensitive to zosyn, which was being used to treat his pneumonia as above.
Urine cx and UA rechecked on [**5-24**] for concern for appearance of urine and mild leukocytosis, he was started on meropenem on [**5-25**] considering a urine cx concerning for ESBL earlier during admission.
Foley was changed by urology team given significant scrotal edema and difficult foley changes in the past on [**5-26**].
# Gastrostomy tube exchange: G tube found to be cracked at the tip on [**5-25**], GI team was consulted and tube was exchanged without complication.
Noted to have some leakage.
Over the course of [**Month (only) **], he became progressively unstable in the setting of severe c. diff and progressive anuric renal failure.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] met with the family on a regular basis to discuss the implications of his progressive instability and the inability to stabilize the situation without hemodialysis, which the renal team and the family had declined.
Between [**6-23**] and [**6-26**], the patient developed longer pauses, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] again explained that he was very likely to pass away from the combined effects of renal failure and infection.
The patient passed away on [**2189-6-26**] from bradycardia and hypotension with the family at the bedside.

Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the ICU because of difficulty breathing, and were found to have a serious pneumonia which was treated with 14 days of IV antibiotics.
You were also were found to have renal failure.
Your kidneys have started producing urine again, however, your creatinine is still elevated but has improved during this admission.
We also tested your urine and found that you have a fungal infection of your urine.
The urology team also changed your foley catheter during this admission due to the urinary tract infection.
We also made some changes in your blood pressure medications, which should also help control your heart rate.
In addition, you were found to have anemia (low blood counts).
This was likely due in part to bleeding from hemorrhoids, but also from your kidney disease.
Medications: - START taking Prazosin 1 mg twice a day - START taking Diltiazem 45 mg four times a day - START taking Famotidine 20 mg daily - START taking Darbopoietin 40 mcg injected once a week - START taking hydrocortisone 2.5% rectal cream 1 application twice a day to hemorrhoids - START taking lactulose 30 mL up to every 8 hours as needed for constipation - START taking probiotic three times a day - START taking senna up to twice a day as needed for constipation - START taking bisacodyl up to every night as needed for constipation - START taking potassium chloride 10 mEq daily  - CONTINUE taking levothyroxine 25 mcg daily - CONTINUE taking glipizide 5 mg daily - CONTINUE using artificial tears as needed for eye dryness - CONTINUE using albuterol-ipratroprium inhalers every 6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing - CONTINUE insulin as needed according to sliding scale  Followup Instructions: Please arrange follow-up with your outpatient physician.
