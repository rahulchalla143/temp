No intervention.
Spanish speaking male with history of PUD s/p Billroth II and celiac disease, admitted on [**2124-4-6**] to MICU for BRBPR, s/p colonoscopy revealing diverticulosis.
# Lower GI Bleed: Patient had a h/o gastric ulcers so initially it was thought that he could have a very brisk UGIB, but with negative NG lavage and rectal blood on exam, lower GI bleed felt more probable.
He received 4 units pRBCs, was prepped overnight and then underwent colonoscopy which revealed diverticulosis and several polyps but no active bleeding.
The polyps were not removed given recent bleed and the patient will need another colonoscopy for removal as an outpatient.
He passed two more clots of old blood per rectum while on the floor, then had no further bleeding for more than 24 hours.
Patient was discharged home but told to return if he had any further bleeding or if he developed lightheadedness.
Because of his history of PUD, he was re-started on omeprazole 20mg daily; he states he does not have any gastritis or reflux symptoms but will discuss whether or not this medication is needed with his PCP.
# Hyperkalemia: Patient has had this in the past in the setting of ARF; on admission, his creatinine was slightly elevated which likely contributed to hyperkalemia.
There were no associated EKG changes and the K trended down through the course of his ICU stay.
# Acute Renal Failure: His baseline creatinine 1.1-1.3 over the last 2 years and on admission his creatinine was high-normal for him at 1.3.
# Left Bundle Branch Block: Patient did not have a history of LBBB including on an EKG 5 months prior to admission.
As he had a syncopal event in the ED, which was thought likely vasovagal in setting of BRBPR, cardiac enzymes were cycled to rule out cardiac event.
EKG remained unchanged although on telemetry patient noted to have intermittent LBBB.
It was thought likely this LBBB was related to age-related degeneration of the cardiac conduction system and less likely ACS so no further workup was pursued.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 41141**], You were admitted with bleeding in your GI tract.
Your bleeding stopped on its own, and you now have a condition called "anemia" (low blood counts from bleeding), which will impove with time as your body recovers.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] within 2 weeks to have your blood counts monitored.
