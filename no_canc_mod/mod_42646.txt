This worsened to the point that he got SOB walking across a room.
He had some transient chest tightness that was relieved with rest but no ongoing chest pain.
He has chronic non-productive cough, no fever.
He has marked increase in his LE edema in past [**1-26**] weeks, L>R per baseline.
He has no ongoing SOB currently.
He notes easy fatiguability but - n/v, abd pain.
He ultimately required CVVH due to severe volume overload.

Mild pulmonary edema.
Left lower lobe patchy atelectasis versus pneumonia.
[**2139-5-12**] EKG Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response.
ST-T wave abnormalities are more marked.
[**2139-5-14**] BRIEF HISTORY:   73 year old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) referred for cardiac catheterization for non-ST elevation MI.
HI last catheterization was on [**2131-4-12**] that showed left dominant system with patent LMCA and ramus only, otherwise occluded LAD, LCX, and RCA.
Arterial Conduit Angiography:  of a left internal mammary artery graft was performed using a preformed [**Female First Name (un) 899**] catheter, with manual contrast injections.

Selective coronary angiogrraphy of this left dominant system revealed severe native three vessel coronary artery disease.
The LAD, LCX, and RCA all had proximal occlusion.
Selective vein graft angiography demonstrated patent SVG-PDA with 80% stenosis in jump segment to the posterolateral branch.
A Swan-Ganz catheter is present, with the tip making an abrupt rightward turn in the expected location of the junction of the main pulmonary artery and its bifurcation into the left and right pulmonary arteries.
There is no pneumothorax.
Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable allowing for positional differences.
There has been interval worsening of a pattern of perihilar haziness and interstitial opacities suggesting worsening pulmonary edema.
A small left pleural effusion is noted.
Right costophrenic angle has been excluded from the study and cannot be assessed.
No pneumothorax is identified.
The previously identified congestive heart failure has been improving.
There is small bilateral pleural effusion and bibasilar patchy atelectasis.
The previously identified mild congestive heart failure has been resolving.
No pneumothorax is identified.
Brief Hospital Course: 73M s/p CABG x 2, CHF EF 20%, AFIB, DM2, abnormal MIBI, p/w worsening SOB/DOE, noted to have NSTEMI via markers.
He was admitted to the medical service on [**2139-5-13**] for decompensated heart failure, NSTEMI and abnormal MIBI.
Patient was then transferred to the CCU for further monitoring and diuretic therapy.
HD notable for elevated wedge to 29.
Beta blocker held d/t HR, ACE I held d/t renal insufficiency.
Patient was tranferred back to floor where he was stable and asymptomatic, breathing comfortably.
He had no chest pain or recurrence of SOB, and he was continued on ASA, avorvastatin, plavix, BB until discharge.
Patient is chronically in Afib and coumadin was held (supratherapeutic) for cardiac cath.
Digoxin was held d/t elevated level of 1.6, and he is due to restart this medication on the day after discharge, per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], every other day.
Held glyburide d/t renal failure, but this was restarted on discharge as patient was back to baseline.
Developed acute on chronic renal failure (2.8 from baseline ~1.8), likely secondary to decompensated heart failure and poor forward flow.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Congestive Heart Failure Non ST elevation myocardial infarction Atrial fibrillation Acute on Chronic renal insufficiency   Discharge Condition: Good.
Patient ambulating without shortness of breath.
No chest pain.
