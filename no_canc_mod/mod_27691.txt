Mr. [**Known lastname 53917**] was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2131-7-15**] to [**2131-7-21**] for coffee ground emesis and abdominal pain following an episode of heavy drinking, which was thought to be due to esophagitis/gastritis in the setting of vomiting from an exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis.
Upon discharge from [**Hospital1 18**], he drank 1.5 pints of vodka and a few beers 1 day prior to admission and 1 pint of [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5261**] on the day of admission.
In the late morning on the day of admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 53917**] began to feel sharp, epigastric/right upper adbominal pain that was [**6-29**] in severity and radiated to the back.
Associated with the pain was nausea, which resulted in 3 episodes of emesis.
The first episode was yellow in color, but the last vomitis had a coffee ground appearance.

In ED, he continued to experience abdominal pain and nausea.
-Chronic pleural effisions -Chronic pancreatitis -Alcohol dependence: heavy drinking started at age 30-35.
H/o delirium with past withdrawal; no h/o seizures.
-Bipolar disorder and anxiety disorder NOS, well controlled on citalopram, quetiapine, and ativan.
Family History: History of alcoholism.
Father alive, with h/o kidney cancer.
Lungs: CTA bilaterally with no w/r/r.
CV: RRR with no m/r/g.
Diffusely positive to light palpation and percussion but increased tenderness in epigastric and right upper quadrants.
No guarding or rigidity.
No caput medusa.
Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ DP and PT pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
[**2131-7-24**]: [**Month/Day/Year **]: stage 1 varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and 2cm non-bleeding nodule consistent with pancreatic rest .
[**2131-7-25**]: EKG: Sinus rhythm.
Non-specific inferior and anteroseptal T wave changes.
[**2131-7-26**]: Sinus rhythm.
Non-specific anterolateral ST-T wave changes.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment/Plan: This is a 42 yo [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] with extensive alcohol abuse, alcoholic cirrhosis with grade I varices s/p banding, and chronic alcoholic pancreatitis, MICU transfer, admitted for coffee-ground emesis following and acute drinking binge.
# Upper GI bleed:  Due to findings of bright red blood via nasogastric lavage, patient was admitted directly to the MICU.
Liver service was consulted, and pt underwent endoscopy, which showed stage 1-2 varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and 2 cm non-bleeding nodule consistent with pancreatic rest grade.
There was no active bleeding visualized.
Cipro was started for SBP prophylaxis, then held for hx or prolonged QTc.
As patient's symptoms improved, he was restarted on a regular diet, and was considered stable for call out to the floor.
Patient did not experience any further episodes of vomiting, nausea, or melena.
Upon discharge, patient was started on nadolol to decrease portal hypertension and reduce the risk of future episodes of variceal bleeding.
Patient has extensive past medical history of alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by history of numerous episodes of UGI bleeding and grade II varices that were banded in the past.
The lack in finding an active source of bleeding via [**Hospital1 **] makes it difficult to cite a clear source, but bleeding etiology may have been multifactorial.
It was thought by GI that the most likley cause of bleeding was from esophagitis secondary to alcohol consumption and vomiting.
Patient was discharged on nadolol for reduction in portal hypertension and reduction in the risk of variceal bleeding.
# Alcohol dependence.
Given extensive alcohol abuse, recent binge, and history of prior withdrawal episodes (no prior seizures), patient was at risk for alcohol withdrawal during this admission.
It was believed by the MICU team that pt was unlikely to develop significant withdrawal as he was abstinent from alcohol from [**Date range (1) 61239**]/09 during his prior admission.
Patient's sympathetic symptoms improved.
#Abdominal pain and nausea: Patient has chronic [**2-27**] baseline pain secondary to chronic pancreatitis that was exacerbated with alcoholic binge prior to admission.
Lack of fever, leukocytosis, and abdominal distension was less worrisome for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
# Alcoholic cirrhosis:  Complicated by coagulopathy, varices, and gastric changes on [**Name (NI) **] consistent with portal hypertension gastropathy.
LFT, [**Name (NI) **], and CBC abnormalities were at baseline during this admission.
No indication of hepatic encephalopathy was observed.
Lactulose was given and no signs of encephalopathy were present.
# leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia:  Lab disruptions were most likely secondary to bone suppression secondary to alcoholic suppression of bone marrow.
Liver disease also likely contributing.
Patient given ferrous sulfate upon discharge to help with anemia secondary to bleeding.
# Coagulopathy.
Believed to be secondary to liver cirrhosis, but may also be due to poor absorption due to poor nutritional status.
#Bipolar disorder and anxiety disorder NOS:  Conditions were well controlled on outpatient regimen of citalopram, quetiapine, ativan, and trazadone.
