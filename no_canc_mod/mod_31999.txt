Ventricular Tachycardia: Etiology of her new onset ventricular tachycardia thought to be due to conduction disorders associated with myotonic dystrophy.
She was initially on lidocaine gtt which was discontinued because of concern over worsening myotonic dystrophy.
She underwent EP study and had ablation of ventricular bundle block re-entry.
In addition, because of extensive conduction system disease the patient was taken back to the EP lab for a pacemaker which she tolerated well.
CXR showed good lead placement and no PTX.
She had no further episdoes on telemetry.
Respiratory Status: Patient was mildly hypoxic and tachypneic on admission.
Clinically euvolemic with clear initial CXR and possible LLL atelectasis.
Had elevated BNP from OSH but difficult to interpret in setting of Myotonic Dystrophy.
No fever, leukocytosis or cough to suggest PNA.
She spike a post op fever which was thought [**12-22**] to atelectasis in setting of weak diaphragm but remained afebrile >48 hours with oxygen sats low to mid 90s on room air prior to discharge.
Elevated LFTS: Patient had slightly elevated LFTs and complaints of nausea but has no other localizing symptoms.
Ventricular tachycardia 2.
Prolonged H-V interval  SECONDARY: Myoclonic Dystrophy Obstructive Sleep Apnea ASD   Discharge Condition: Hemodynamically stable, afebrile, ambulating   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for an arrhythmia called ventricular tachycardiac (VT).
You had a cardiac ablation to treat this arrythmia.
Because you have abnormalities in your heart's conduction system, you also had a pacemaker placed.
If you notice swelling, bleeding, redness or increasing pain at the pacer site, please call the device clinic at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**].
If you have any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness or loss of consciousness, please call your doctor or go to the emergency department.
If you have any concerning symptoms in general, you should seek medical attention.
