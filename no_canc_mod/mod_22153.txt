History of seizure disorder.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Severe peripheral vascular disease.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59 year old female with a past medial history significant for hypertension, seizure disorder since age 3 with last seizure 2 years ago, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, pneumonia with last episode in [**2150**], questionable lung nodule with negative biopsy in [**2148**], and prior tobacco use who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2153-8-20**] after 2 days of blurred vision, nausea/emesis, and unsteadiness on her feet.
The patient denied any dysarthria, headache or focal weakness associated with her presenting symptoms.
The patient was seen and evaluated in the Emergency Room at  [**Hospital3 **] and found to have a systolic blood pressure in the 200's with a CT scan showing a large right cerebellar infarct.
A magnetic resonance angiogram of the neck and brain was done which showed an acute right cerebellar infarct as well as 70-80 percent stenosis of both internal carotid arteries with severe atherosclerotic disease at the carotid bifurcations.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Seizure disorder since age 3, last seizure 2 years ago.
Peripheral vascular disease.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile with heart rate in the 70's and blood pressure of 239/65 on admission, she is saturating 95 percent on room air.
She had no carotid bruits.
She had a well healed scar on the right side of her neck just lateral to the sternal notch.
It did not show any evidence of new bleed.
Given the patient's severe carotid disease, peripheral vascular disease, calcified aorta, and new cerebellar infarct it was felt that the patient was at higher risk for a new stroke than for embolization of this mobile atheroma.
It was also felt that given her severe carotid disease and vertebral disease that there was really no proof that this atheroma was the source of her cerebellar infarct.
She was seen by neurology who felt that she should have a metabolic work up for the source of her somnolence and blood cultures were sent as well as a repeat urinalysis.
The patient had been on Levaquin, at transfer for an E. Coli urinary tract infection and is continued on this throughout her hospital at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
Also of note the patient did have a bout of tachycardia with a heart rate in the low 100's.
An EKG done at that time showed some deepening of her ST depression laterally.
On repeat EKG she did have still have some deepening of ST in the lateral leads as well as flipped T waves in V2 and V3.
As part of an infectious workup for mental status changes a chest x-ray was done on the morning of [**8-26**].
It showed mild congestive heart failure,  The patient was given Lasix 40 mg IV with little response.
