Admission Date:  [**2161-1-13**]              Discharge Date:   [**2161-2-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2102-11-16**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1491**] Chief Complaint: here for TIPs eval  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: s/p failed TIPs on [**2161-1-20**]   History of Present Illness: Briefly, the patient is a 58 y/o F with cirrhosis likely, secondary to sarcoidosis, c/b esophageal varices who presents for direct admission for TIPS evaluation.
The pt was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 35603**] for TIPS eval s/p episode of hematemesis with banding at an OSH.
She became febrile during that admission and there was concern that she had endocarditis so she was started on vancomycin and was to complete at least a 6 week course.
Additionally developed R swollen leg and was found to have abscesses along the muscle of the R thigh.
TIPS procedure was not done at that admission because of concern for endocarditis.
She denies N/V, fevers, chills, diarrhea, urinary symptoms or confusion.
She did have some abdominal pain yesterday but thinks it was [**1-22**] to having to sit up during her 5 hour car ride from [**State 1727**].
The pain has since resolved.

Endocarditis ([**Date range (1) 35604**]) 5) Thigh abscesses (?rel to septic emboli, [**Date range (1) 35604**]) 6) Hypersplenism - splen 19 cm -> thrombocytopenia 7) History of dysphagia 8) GERD 9) Hypertension 10) OSA 11) Bipolar disorder, type II 12) Spastic bladder with incontinence 13) Constipation   Social History: Denies smoking, etOh, no illicits.

No fluctuance.
Neuro: CN II-XII intact, non focal, no asterixis.
Right lower ext venous doppler:IMPRESSION: No DVT.
Patent main and right portal veins with hepatopetal flow.
R thigh MRI: IMPRESSION: Persistent yet decreased volume of fluid within multilobulated tubular collections within the soft tissues and muscles of the right thigh.
No new fluid collection identified.
Nodular, atrophic cirrhotic liver consistent with patient's history of sarcoidosis.
Evaluation of hepatic arterial supply is limited due to non-breath-hold technique.
However, prior abdominal CT scans demonstrate conventional hepatic arterial anatomy.
Right-sided effusion, ascites and evidence of portal hypertension.
Echo: INTERPRETATION:  Findings:  LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Contrast study was performed with 3 iv injections of 8 ccs of agitated normal saline, at rest, with cough and post-Valsalva maneuver.
Left pleural effusion.
Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Agitated saline contrast study demonstrated no significant intracardiac shunt at rest or with cough and Valsalva release (cannot definitively exclude).
No anginal symptoms or ischemic changes noted.
Ascitis, splenomegaly and small liver are noted.
Resting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the myocardium.
Ascitis, splenomegaly and small liver are noted.
Brief Hospital Course: 58F with sarcoidosis, with pulmonary involvement and liver cirrhosis, HTN, R atrophic kidney, esophageal varices, who presented for re-eval for TIPS as well as initial work-up for liver transplant.
# TIPS evaluation - Patient was initially admitted on [**2160-12-2**] to [**2160-12-26**] for potential TIPs eval due to recurrent variceal bleeding in [**11-24**] requiring banding.
The results showed persistent but smaller fluid collections in the right thigh.
It failed due to clots in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic portal vein with short segment of portal vein occlusion and cavernous transformation.
The course was complicated by hypotension and hypoxia and subsequent transfer to the ICU as described below.
# Liver transplant eval: Upon return to the floor patient underwent liver transplant evaluation.
Patient also underwent cardiac MIBI that showed preserved EF with no reversible defects and no suggestion of CAD.
Patient has a positive Ab for VZV (IgG), EBV (IgG not IgM), positive CMV IgG and IgM but undetectable CMV viral load.
She has US performed that showed patent main and right portal veins with hepatopetal flow.
She was continued on Levofloxacin 500 mg QD for SBP prophylaxis.
Patient never showed any signs of encephalopathy or asterixis.
# Hypotension: Patient with a transient episodes of hypotension after failed tips on [**1-20**].
Differential diagnosis at the time included blood loss (although minimal EBL during TIPS), sepsis (patient with negative culture, to date, afebrile, no WBC, but is currently being treated for bacteremia), volume depletion given recent paracentesis and large fluid shifts or post-anesthesia induced hypotension.
# Hypoxia - Patient has underlying restrictive pulmonary disease due to her underlying sarcoidosis.
Her CXR during this admission was also c/w mod pulmonary edema, probably due to aggressive volume resuscitation.
ABG on room gas did reveal hypoxia of paO2 of 57, after long discussion it was decided that this close to her baseline due to her underlying restrictive lung disease.
# R thigh abscess/myositis - Patient was found to have R thigh abscesses (drained by IR, Cx grew Strep Miliri) and bacteremia ([**12-2**] - 2/2 bottles MSSA).
R thigh was reimaged and showed persistent but some reduction in the size of collection.
# Endocarditis: Patient has been on Vancomycin since [**2160-12-3**] for presumed endocarditis given MSSA bacteremia, [**Last Name (un) 1003**] lesions, and R thigh abscesses.
She did not have any evidence of vegetations on repeat Echo's.
No TEE is done as patient is a high risk due to esophageal varices.
Long standing sarcoidosis and liver failure are also probably contributing to her renal insufficiency.
# Impaired glucose tolerate - patient with early AM sugars of 120-140.
She may require introduction of oral agents in the future if her BS remains elevated now that she is titrated off prednisone.
# Thrush.
# Bipolar disorder.
# Communication - w/pt and husband [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 35605**] .
# Access - right PICC .
