Ultrasound was used to identify the right brachial vein which was patent and compressible.
Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before and after venous access documenting patency.
The micropuncture sheath was therefore replaced with a vascular access sheath and a Glidewire was able to be advanced into the lower SVC.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate post-procedure complications.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: This is a 62 yo M h/o recent hospitalization for urosepsis, CVA, HTN, DVT p/w sepsis and was treated in the MICU with pressor and antibiotics.
The possible source of his sepsis was thought to be his indwelling Hickman.
Sepsis from Bacterial Line Infection (outside line): Pt was initially found to have a temperature of 104.9F during routine vital signs at his long term care facility ([**Location (un) **] Manor).
However, pt has multiple potential sources for infection inlcude a possible infiltrate on CXR, positive U/A, infxn of sacral decub, and R Hickman.
He was on levophed for about 12 hrs for BP augmentation.
Pt had blood cultures growing coag neg staph and enterococcus in blood cx.
Sensitivities of the enteroccus species showed vancomycin sensitivity.
was febrile after treatment, ID recommended w/u of possible chronic osteomyelitis.
He was asymptomatic and without UE swelling.
2. decubitus ulcer: The patient has a chronic ulcers (stage III decubitis ulcers) that did not look infected.
5. h/o dvt: We were unable to obtain further history of his DVTS.
7. acute renal failure: The patient was admitted with Cr 1.8 wich improved to 0.8 s/p volume resuscitation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) **] Manor  Discharge Diagnosis: sepsis CVA HTN history of urosepsis decubitis ulcers history of deep vein thrombosis   Discharge Condition: good.
