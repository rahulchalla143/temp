Admission Date:  [**2199-1-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2199-1-28**]  Date of Birth:   [**2121-8-10**]       Sex:  M  Service:  Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77 year old man with a history of atrial fibrillation and aortic valve replacement, who presented to his primary care physician's office on the day of admission with one to two weeks of progressive dyspnea.
The patient denies chest pain, nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis with these events.
He describes difficulty sleeping over the last several weeks, but denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
He does not note increased swelling of his lower extremities.
He describes an occasional productive cough with yellow sputum but denies fevers.
He has had a decrease in his appetite recently.
The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed.
He denies bright red blood per rectum as well as hematemesis.
Status post aortic valve replacement secondary to rheumatic heart disease in [**2184**].
Atrial fibrillation.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Status post gunshot wound to left leg.
History of left lower extremity cellulitis.
History of gastrointestinal bleeding attributed to gastritis, requiring over 20 units of blood transfusions earlier this year.
Chronic renal failure.
History of colonic adenoma.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation, positive left cataract, extraocular movements intact, anicteric sclerae, oropharynx clear.
Neck:  No lymphadenopathy, jugular venous pressure at 9 cm, supple.
Lungs:  Bilateral crackles two-thirds of the way on the left, one-half of the way on the right, moving air in all segments.
Cardiovascular:  Mechanical click, irregularly irregular rhythm, II/VI systolic ejection murmur at right upper sternal border.
Rectal:  Normal tone, no masses, heme positive brown stool, no hemorrhoids, no fissures.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema in upper extremities, hyperemia of venous stasis in lower extremities with some edema of right lower extremity, 2+ pitting edema mid-calf and below in left lower extremity, no ulcers.
Chest x-ray:  No evidence of congestive heart failure, no infiltrate.
Electrocardiogram:  Atrial fibrillation, unchanged from prior tracing except for inverted T waves in V4 and V5.
Gastrointestinal:  Of note, the patient has a history of presenting with shortness of breath when he has had anemia secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.
At this time, he continued to have guaiac negative stools and no melena.
When the patient had another drop in his hematocrit to 29.1 on [**2199-1-8**], the gastroenterology service was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding possible endoscopy.
At this time, they declined endoscopy because the patient has had multiple upper endoscopies and an colonoscopy earlier this year, which revealed gastritis.
The gastroenterology service opted to do an endoscopy to evaluate the status of his gastritis and possible arteriovenous malformation.
The patient received an upper endoscopy on [**2199-1-14**], which revealed a single nonbleeding arteriovenous malformation in the pylorus of the stomach, which was electrocauterized, as well as a single small arteriovenous malformation with stigmata of recent bleeding in the jejunum, which was also electrocauterized.
The patient continued to have a low hematocrit, with blood transfusion requirements and a tagged red blood cell scan was performed, which was negative for evidence of active bleeding.
He has had guaiac negative stools and no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding.
Cardiovascular:  Both heart failure and cardiac ischemia were felt to be in the differential diagnosis for the patient's shortness of breath on presentation.
On [**2199-1-7**], the patient underwent a pharmacological stress test, which was negative for evidence of ischemia.
He received an echocardiogram on [**2199-1-8**], which revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of about 40%, depressed right ventricular function with evidence of right greater than left heart failure.
While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient became hypotensive, requiring fluid boluses and, briefly, a dobutamine drip.
In response to the fluids he received, the patient developed evidence of heart failure on physical examination and on chest x-ray.
After the patient's stay in the MICU, the patient was noted to have a substantial amount of ventricular ectopy.
The electrophysiology service was consulted and they recommended that he be continued on rate control for atrial fibrillation (metoprolol) without a recommendation for an ICD or amiodarone.
The patient was anticoagulated for his prosthetic aortic valve except when he had evidence of active gastrointestinal bleeding.
Pulmonary:  At the time of the patient's admission to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was in respiratory distress and was intubated without complications.
He was extubated on [**2199-1-21**] and has not had significant respiratory difficulties on minimal oxygen from nasal cannula since then.
Infectious disease:  While in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient had a chest x-ray which was suggestive of possible ventilator associated pneumonia.
He was also noted to have substantial erythema of the left lower extremity, possibly consistent with cellulitis.
On [**2199-1-25**], the patient was noted to have a large quantity of loose stool.
Renal:  The patient has chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine in the vicinity of 2.
Musculoskeletal:  On the evening of [**2199-1-10**], the patient was noted to have severe pain in the left popliteal region.
The patient was treated with analgesic medications for the pain from this cyst.
An orthopedic consult did not recommend any intervention and did not feel that the patient had any evidence of compartment syndrome.
