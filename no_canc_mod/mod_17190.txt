IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular dysfunction with an aneurysm of the anterior/anteroapical wall.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images not available for review) of [**2121-8-30**], the degree of mitral regurgitation has probably increased.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular dysfunction with a large aneurysm of the anterior wall.
Mild mitral regurgitation and trace aortic regurgitation.
CXR: [**5-17**] IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities and cardiomegaly may relate to CHF in the appropriate clinical setting, with bibasilar opacities relating to pleural effusions and overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal multiple fixed perfusion  defects including a severe anterior and apical defect as well as  moderate anterolateral and distal inferolateral defects.
Gated images reveal global hypokinesis.
There is no prior for comparison.
IMPRESSION: 1) Multiple fixed perfusion defects including a severe anterior and apical defect as well as moderate anterolateral and distal inferolateral defects.
2) Severe left ventricular enlargement with global hypokinesis and an LVEF of 18%.
Long term plavix recommended."

Brief Hospital Course: Ms [**Known lastname 74813**] is a 82 year-old woman with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 20-25% admitted to the CCU with acute on chronic CHF exacerbation resulting in respiratory failure.
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE:  On admission to the ED clinical picture was consistent with pulmonary edema,  CXR notable for pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral effusions.
As for etiology for her CHF exacerbation this is attributable to excess fluid intake and dietary indiscretion on the days preceeding her admission.
Other potential causes are thought unlikely: she had no signs or symptoms of infection, Ucx and Bcx were negative; her clinical complaints, EKG, TTE and biomarkers were not suggestive of an ischemic event.
# AF w/ RVR: this developed with concurrent hypotension on [**5-19**].
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: EKG currently difficult to interpret for ischemia given LBBB which is old.
TTE unchanged from prior with no evidence of new WMA.
# CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE.
# Abdominal Pain.
Patient with long history of chronic constipation.
Was treated with laxatives with consequent BM and resolution of abdominal pain.
# HYPERTENSION: Had some episodes of hypotension during this admission first in the setting of intubation then in the setting of AF/RVR.
- adjust duretic and BP medication as needed.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1820**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Location (un) 1821**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Ventricular tachycardia Acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure Secondary diagnosis: Ischemic cardiomyopathy Dyslipidemia Hypertension Chronic kidney disease Coronary artery disease constipation   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You had an acute exacerbation of your systolic congestive heart failure and needed increased amounts of diuretics to get rid of the fluid.
Start taking Digoxin to help your heart beat more effectively  Weigh yourself every morning, call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3357**] if weight goes up more than 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 pounds in 3 days.
