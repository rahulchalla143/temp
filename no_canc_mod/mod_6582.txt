Admission Date:  [**2180-12-22**]       Discharge Date:  [**2181-1-2**]   Service:  CT Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89 year old female who was transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2180-12-22**] from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital, where she was recently admitted and ruled in for a myocardial infarction.
She was transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for catheterization and evaluation for possible coronary artery bypass grafting.
Known coronary artery disease, status post stent to left anterior descending artery in [**2176**]; cardiac catheterization in [**2177**] revealed three vessel disease as well as in-stent stenosis with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 49% at that time.
Left cerebral infarction in [**2179-2-10**].
History of ventral hernia.
History of lumbar disk disease.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
General:  Elderly female in no acute distress.
Neck:  Without jugular venous distention, supple.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm with premature ventricular contractions, grade II/VI apical systolic murmur, positive S3.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds, ventral hernia, well healed surgical scars.
Extremities:  Trace pedal edema bilaterally and warm to touch.
Neurological:  Alert and oriented with no focal deficits evident.
LABORATORY DATA:  Admission chest x-ray revealed cardiomegaly, mild congestive heart failure with no pleural effusions.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the catheterization laboratory on [**2180-12-25**], where catheterization revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% as well as significant three vessel coronary artery disease and moderate mitral regurgitation.
Also on [**2180-12-25**], the patient underwent carotid duplex studies which ruled out any hemodynamically significant lesion of either left or right internal carotid artery.
On postoperative day number three, at approximately 9:30 in the morning, the patient was noted to be in rapid atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response in the 120s.
The patient continued to progression on the floor over the next couple of days with cardiac rehabilitation, however, she still remained somewhat unsteady on her feet and unable to ambulate independently.
The most recent chest x-ray is from [**2180-12-29**] which reveals small bilateral effusions with no pneumothorax.
Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery     bypass grafting.
Postoperative atrial fibrillation.
