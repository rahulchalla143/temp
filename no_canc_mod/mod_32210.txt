Admission Date:  [**2180-8-21**]              Discharge Date:   [**2180-8-24**]  Date of Birth:  [**2129-11-11**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**] Chief Complaint:  Chest discomfort  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization with Thrombectomy and Drug Eluting Stent to Right Coronary Artery   History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 80182**] is a 50-year-old man with a PMH significant for hyperlipidemia who presented to the ED at 7:30PM with a chief complaint of chest discomfort.
On the drive home at about 6:30PM he began to notice symptoms of light-headedness and experienced some diaphoresis.
He pulled over to the side of the road and his symptoms resolved transiently, only to recur about 5 minutes later, this time more intense and associated with 4/10 bilateral chest discomfort which he describes as "tightness" that radiated bilaterally to his shoulders and upper back.
He denies any palpitations or nausea during this episode.
Of note, the patient reports a few prior episodes similar to this over the past two years after working out which he attributes to "hypoglycemia" although he has no known diabetes.
He has never experienced chest discomfort to this degree however.
An EKG showed ST elevations in II, III, AVF, V5, and V6.
He was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab where he was found to have a distal sub-total occlusion in the RCA into which an everolimus-eluting stent was placed after thrombectomy was performed.
The procedure was complicated by by a hematoma during sheath pull for which he received some protamine and the integrillin was discontinued.

He was found to have a STEMI with RCA occlusion found on emergent cardiac catheterization and an additional 70% ulcertated lesion of LAD was also identified.
As aforementioned, the patient's presenting EKG showed ST elevations in II, III, AVF, V5, and V6 indicative of inferior and lateral acute myocardial infarction or STEMI.
He was taken emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab where he was found to have a distal sub-total occlusion in the RCA and an everolimus-eluting stent was placed after thrombectomy was performed.
He had a small right groin hematoma after his catheterization sheath pull but otherwise he had no major complications post-operatively.
At time of discharge the localized right groin ecchymoses and hematoma margins had decreased and the patient appeared to be improving nicely.
He was advised that he should follow-up in approximately 3 weeks for a stress MIBI to help risk stratify the LAD lesion which was noted on cardiac catheterization.
Mr. [**Known lastname 80182**] had no signs or symptoms indicative of heart failure/CHF during his hospital stay.
A follow-up echo post-cath showed LVEF 50%, mild LVH and some regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild focal hypokinesis of the basal inferior/inferoseptal segments was seen.
Throughout his CCU stay the patient was monitored on telemetry and he had no significant ectopy, just a few episodes of sinus tachycardia.
No bradycardia, sinus pauses, or AV block was demonstrated despite setting of recent RV infarct.
Also of note, the patient had a slight elevation in his BUN/Cr which was attributed to mild dehydration and the patient was encouraged to increase his fluid intake.
Electrolytes were repleted as needed and BUN/Cr were monitored daily.
Electrolyte labs revealed some hypophosphatemia which was felt to be secondary to respiratory alkalosis in the setting of ACS.
He reported no diarrhea or antacid use.
On hospital day 2 the patient complained of some mild urinary urgency and a basic UA was sent along with a urine culture.
Both studies were negative for any signs of infection and the patient's urgency had resolved by time of discharge.
For ongoing management of his CAD and dyslipidemia issues  atorvastatin 80mg daily was started for tighter control in the setting of ACS.
He had a slight LFT increase during his hospitalization which was attributed to his acute MI.
He was given additional SC heparin daily as DVT prophylaxis and his groin region hematoma pain was well-controlled with Tylenol.
Social work assessed patient's support system and coping skills during this acute phase of his newly diagnosed HTN and MI.
He was offered therapy and given contact information for additional support.
