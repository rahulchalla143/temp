Admission Date:  [**2130-2-7**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-2-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2060-7-16**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**] Chief Complaint: s/p Carotid stent  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Primary: Carotid angiogram Carotid Stenting (left)   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 69yo male with a history of coronary artery disease s/p LAD and RCA stent placement, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia initially presented with dizziness in [**Month (only) 1096**] [**2128**] in the setting of a bowel movement.
He was seen initially at [**Hospital3 3765**] where his symptoms were likely related to vasovagal response.
Follow-up carotid ultrasound demonstrated 70-99% stenosis of the left ICA and 50-69% stenosis of the right ICA.
His angiography demonstrated left carotid with 95% origin stenosis in the ICA that was crossed was predilated and stented, then post dilated with 5.0 balloon with 0% residual.
During the post dilation period, te patient was hypotensive and bradycardic despite treatment with atropine and was transiently on dopamine and neosynephrine, but was stabilized and off these medications prior to arrival in the CCU.
The patient denies any recent dizziness, focal weakness, or numbness.
He denies any amaurosis fugax.
He denies any chest pain or dyspnea.
He denies any PND or orthopnea.
Tachycardia since age 31 2.
CAD s/p PCI to LAD in [**2117**], most recently cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2 to the RCA in [**2126**] 3.
Hypertension 4.
Hyperlipidemia 7.
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: CTAB, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Imaging of the right carotid showed moderate non-flow limiting disease.
Imaging of the left carotid revealed an proximal left internal 95% stenosis with slow flow.
Given very tight stenosis we elected to proceed to intervention.
We advanced a Angled glide catheter to external carotid on left and exchanged for a SupraCore wire.
With post dilation patient had bradycardia treated with atropine and transient dopamine.
The filter was removed without incident and with no visible clot.
Final angiography with no residual and no complications.
Post intervention imaging of the cerebral circulation via the left common carotid revealed the left carotid to fill the MCA and fetal origin PCA.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the CCU for monitoring status post carotid stent placement for carotid stenosis.
He also was given atropine once for bradycardia, nausea, and hypotension.
He was asymptomatic and had no neurologic deficits.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Carotid stenosis  Secondary: CAD   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for a stent in your left carotid artery.
Please call your doctor or come the emergency room if you have lightheadedness, chest pain, change in vision or any other concerning symptoms.
