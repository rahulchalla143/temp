She did not have any specific complaints but her husband reports development of diarrhea two days PTA which he thinks was due to metformin being started.
Due to concern for possible repeat or progression of intraparencymal bleed she was transferred here for neurosurgical evaluation.
She was intubated on arrival in the ED due to somnolence and concern that she would not be able to protect her airway.
She had a LP without evidence of infection.
There was no evidence of new or worsened bleed.
Past Medical History: Left Temporal Intraparenchymal hemorrhage afib- was on coumadin for last few years TIA- had prior episodes of flashes of light going across her visual field, was placed on plavix.
Dementia- secondary to diabetic coma Chronic Low Back Pain Anemia GERD COPD- no prior h/o tobacco use, + secondhand exposure   Social History: Lives with husband until recent admission, used to work as the press secretary to a state senator in the state house.

Expected evolution of left medial temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with decreased intraventricular blood in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
No new hemorrhage, herniation, hydrocephalus, or other acute intracranial process.
Subacute well-defined hemorrhage in the left medial temporal lobe without surrounding edema.
The appearances are nonspecific, but given the location, primary hemorrhage is less likely and an underlying condition like cavernous malformation should be considered.
Increased signal in the splenium of corpus callosum can be seen in patients with seizure and postictal stage.
However, subtle increased signal within the pyramidal tracts bilaterally is unusual for postictal status.
This could reflect degenerative changes within the pyramidal tract.
[**2103-2-24**] EEG: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence of a slow and disorganized background with increased slowing in the left hemisphere.
This indicates a moderate encephalopathy with an area of subcortical dysfunction on the left.
The former finding is most often caused by medication, metabolic disturbances, or infection.
There were no epileptiform features noted.

# Agitation/altered mental status: Was initially unclear what caused alteration in her mental status.
She was afebrile and did not have any evidence of infection.
MRI showed a bulbous basilar artery but otherwise was unremarkable for a cause of her symptoms.
Her altered mental status was likely multifactorial to include medications, as well as her hypercarbia, OSA/COPD (see below).
ABG showed mild hypoxemia with p02 in the 50s-60s as well as significant hypercarbia, with pC02 in the 80s-90s, occationally in the 100s.
During her admission she had periods of somnolence possibly due to increased carbon dioxide retention in the setting of untreated OSA.
# Recent Left temporal hemorrhage: Was stable on CT and MRI.
# Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation: Was in sinus rhythm throughout admission.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Location (un) 6594**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Acute Delirium (multifactorial) Hypercarbic respiratory failure Sleep disordered breathing .
Secondary Diagnoses: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Atrial Fibrillation s/p Intracranial hemorrhage Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus   Discharge Condition: Afebrile, hemodynamically stable, oxygenating well.
Discharge Instructions: The patient was admitted with altered mental status and hypercarbia.
Her altered mental status was likely multifactorial to include medications and hypercarbia.
Her hypercarbia was thought related to her COPD and likely newly diagnosed sleep disordered breathing.
Please have patient return to the hospital if you experience somnolence not improved with BiPAP, shortness of breath, or any other assoicated symptoms.
Please follow up in sleep clinic at [**Hospital1 18**] in the next few weeks to arrange for a sleep study and further titration of her sleep machine.
