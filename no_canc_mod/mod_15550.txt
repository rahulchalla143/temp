HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64 year old obese white female with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in [**2164**] and [**2168**], in anterior and inferior distributions with an ejection fraction of 10%.
She was transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital for congestive heart failure and Electrophysiology management.
The patient also has peripheral vascular disease, bilateral lower extremity embolectomies, history of pulmonary embolism, chronic atrial fibrillation, and a small ventricular septal defect.
The patient's cardiac history began in [**2164**] when she sustained an anterior wall myocardial infarction and subsequent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty/stent, with an left anterior descending with an ejection fraction of 30 to 35%.
In [**2168**], she sustained an inferior wall myocardial infarction.
An echocardiogram from his office reveals a dilated left ventricle with hypokinesis of the proximal anterior and inferior walls, dyskinesis of the septum and akinesis with an ejection fraction of 10%.
The patient also had moderate bilateral atrial enlargement, mild mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation.
She had symptoms of fluid retention which improved but she developed nausea, vomiting and diarrhea with a decrease in weight of 25 pounds.
Her creatinine was noticed to be increased and she had an elevated digoxin level.
She was transferred on [**9-17**] to [**Hospital1 69**] for evaluation for a biventricular pacer and for advanced congestive heart failure management.
The patient states that she did not feel well until after she had her second myocardial infarction.
She has felt worse over this summer with increased fluid retention, fatigue, some orthopnea and increased lower extremity edema.
The patient also cites some epigastric discomfort over the summer and some recent diarrhea.
Coronary artery disease status post anterior inferior myocardial infarction in [**2164**] and [**2168**].
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 10%.
Peripheral vascular disease with bilateral lower extremity embolectomies in [**2164**].
Small ventricular septal defect.
Chronic atrial fibrillation.
Status post thyroid surgery.
She is unmarried and she has no children.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for maternal cardiac history.
ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies but is sensitive to adhesive tape.
No carotid bruits.
Cardiac:  Irregularly irregular; II/VI systolic ejection murmur.
No rales, no wheezes.
Abdomen soft; mild tenderness in left lower quadrant.
Extremities:  Two plus lower extremity edema to the knees.
EKG showed atrial fibrillation with a rate of 86 beats per minute.
There was left axis deviation and a left bundle branch block.
Chest x-ray disclosed cardiomegaly without evidence of failure.
CARDIOLOGY:  A) Ischemia - the patient was continued on her statin.
This test was not limited by muscle fatigue, no arm, neck or back discomfort was reported by the patient throughout the study.
The ST segments are uninterpretable for ischemia in the setting of baseline left bundle branch block.
The rhythm was atrial fibrillation with several isolated VPCs and two ventricular couplets.
Blunted systolic blood pressure response to exercise.
There was no in-stent restenosis in the left anterior descending.
There is a recanalized lesion in the mid-RCA.
She was initially noted to be in atrial fibrillation.
An echocardiogram on [**9-21**], disclosed an ejection fraction of 15%; there was right atrium and left atrium dilatation.
There was severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
The right ventricle cavity was mildly dilated.
Right ventricular systolic function was depressed and with mild one plus mitral regurgitation.
There was concern for blood loss after the pacemaker insertion, possibly from the carotid sinus.
Stool studies were sent as well as ova and parasites and Clostridium difficile; all studies were negative.
Etiology of the patient's acute renal insufficiency was believed to be due to her prerenal azotemia.
Her acute renal insufficiency resolved.
The patient's TSH was found to be slightly elevated at 5.1 on the day of admission.
PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE:  The patient has a history of bilateral lower extremity emboli and has an IVC filter.
On [**10-2**], she will follow-up in Dr.[**Name (NI) 44654**] clinic at 10:30 a.m. to have her INR checked.
Biventricular congestive heart failure.
Status post biventricular pacemaker / AICD placement.
