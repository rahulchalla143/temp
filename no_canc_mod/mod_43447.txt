Pneumonia is not excluded.
These radiographs are extremely limited due to poor penetration and are thus nondiagnostic.
Resolution of left upper lobe opacity.
Bilateral perihilar haziness suggestive of perihilar edema likely due to fluid overload .
ECHO [**2185-5-3**] Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is abnormal septal motion/position.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
Doubt overt CHF or pneumonia  RIGHT PICC LINE PLACEMENT [**2185-5-4**] IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 55 cm 5- French double- lumen PICC via the right brachial vein with tip in the superior vena cava.
ULTRASOUND RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY [**2185-5-5**] IMPRESSION: Limited exam but no evidence for DVT.
The patient presented with hypoxia which resolved, but was noted to have possible radiographic findings significant for pneumonia.
Mr. [**Known lastname 34682**] was also noted to have MRSA bacteremia and was treated with Vancomycin.
L PICC was likely source of MRSA bacteremia, and PNA may be due to different organism.
The pt was also empirically treated with oral Flagyl for the C.diff colitis, however 3 sets of stool were negative for C. difficile toxin.
Two sets of pt's blood cultures showed MRSA and the rest of the cultures were pending at the time of discharge and will need to be followed by the pt's primary care physician.
ID:  The pt was noted to have interval worsening of bilateral airspace opacities which could have represented an underlying pneumonia (however he did not have an elevated white cell count).
He was also noted to have MRSA bacteremia, with his left side PICC as likely source.
The pt was also noted to have diarrhea in the setting of antibiotic use.
The pt had 3 stool samples sent that were negative for C. difficile toxin.
Respiratory: The pt was noted to have an interval worsening of airspaces which could have represented an underlying pneumonia.
The pt remained afebrile on the floor and his white count was not elevated.
The pt was maintained on CPAP (18 cm QHS) at night for his obstructive sleep apnea.
Renal: Patient has chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine 1.3-1.5) and he was noted to have a creatinine of 1.8 on admission.
Anemia: The pt has a history of anemia of chronic disease, likely secondary to chronic renal disease.
Diabetes Mellitus: The pt was noted to have elevated blood glucose level (in 200 range) for which his standing morning 70/30 dose of insulin was increased.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 105**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Pneumonia .
Secondary: Prader Willi Syndrome Morbid Obesity DM II CRI w/ baseline creatinine 1.8-2 OSA on home CPAP Mental retardation   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: Please report to the nearest emergency department if you have fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or increasing pain in your right leg.
There has been a change in your medications.
