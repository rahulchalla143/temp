Pt also had a leukocytosis (wbc 36) and positive U/A, and was started on vanc/levo/flagyl.
In the ED, the patient developed VT arrest in setting of sepsis and a Mg 0.8.
In the MICU the pt was noted to have loose stools.
He required a lasix drip [**Date range (1) 46801**] for fluid overload from resuscitation.
On the medicine floor he became dyspneic with O2 requirement.
On [**11-24**] Lasix was held for hypotension and dyspnea worsened.
Because of this worsening of dyspnea CE were drawn and showed elevated Trop-T to 3.12 and CK of 15 c/w NSTEMI.
On [**11-25**] BP stablized and pt has responded with increased urine output to Lasix IV bolus with Metolazone.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**] today for management of NSTEMI and better management of fluid status.

Findings consistent with pancolitis, significantly increased in severity and extent compared to the prior study.
This could be due to an inflammatory or infectious process, including C. Difficile colitis.
Large bilateral pleural effusions.
Diffuse anasarca.
Increased interstitial opacities bilaterally consistent with fluid overload.
More focal airspace opacities involving the right lung may represent asymmetric pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
Persistent opacification of the right cardiophrenic angle may represent right middle lobe collapse.
Sinus rhythm.
Right bundle-branch block.
ST-T wave abnormalities.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %) with regional variation: the inferior and posterior walls are more hypokinetic than the rest of the left ventricle.

The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.

# Cardiac arrest / Ischemia: In the ED a 'code blue' was called when he became unresponsive and was noted to have a polymorphic VT vs. torsades rhythm.
The etiology of the arrest is likely due to severe electrolyte derangements, including a magnesium of 0.8 that was in the process of repletion.
This was likely complicated by cardiac ischemia from sepsis/hypotension.
Cardiac enzymes were trended and were markedly elevated as expected after defibrillation and troponin reached a peak of 1.95 and then trended downward.
While on the medical floor he developed hypotension and dyspnea.
Cardiac Enzymes were again drawn and showed an increased troponin to 3.12, up from 1.52 five days prior.
He was started on a heparin drip and transferred to the [**Hospital1 1516**] Cardiology service for management on his NSTEMI and for better managment of his fluid status.
He was chest pain free while on the Cardiology service.
On [**11-29**], pt had an episode of hypotension with SBP 84.
An EKG was done which showed marked TWI in V2-V4 and ST elevations in II,III and AVF.
Pt was hypotensive peri-operatively, and recovered to the CCU for 24 hours.
On the medicine floor pt had intermitted episodes of increased HR (see atrial tachy below) as well as episodes of hypotension (unrelated to tachyarrythmias), see below.
# Afib/Atach:  Pt w/ VT code upon presentation.
Recurrent runs of atrial tachycardia to 140s/150s, self resolving, but w/ occasional cp.
cards c/s, recommended no albuterol to decrease adrenergic drive, aggressive pain control, inc metoprolol to 50 [**Hospital1 **] (from 25 tid),and change captopril to lisinopril 10. the metorpolol/lisinopril were subsequently d/ced due to increasing number of episodes of asympt hypotension w/ SBP in 70s.
# Asymptomatic hypotension: pt triggered multiple times on floor for SBP 70-80.
asymptomatic during events.
Pt got stress dose steroids in micu, which were subsequently d/ced on floor.
Restarted at 5mg qdaily given persistent borderline BPs, though asymptomatic .
# Sepsis: At presentation Mr. [**Known lastname **] had evidence by labs, history, and imaging of a severe c.dif colitis, which was confirmed by laboratory results.
Other possible sources could be his UTI or his abdominal wound / recent surgery.
# Left Ischemic Optic neuropathy-Pt reported poor vision in left eye [**11-29**] initially and had reported this had been ongoing for the few days prior.
However this intial complaint of vision change was in the context of a STEMI and pt quickly went to cath; thus upon review of systems when patient came back from cath, pt reported poor vision in both eyes, Left>right.
Patient appeared to have complete loss of vision in the left eye and there was a concern for embolic stroke.
An MRI/MRA was done which did not show evidence of embolic dz or stroke.
Opthamology consulted and felt pt likely has ischemic damange to optic nerve likely [**2-5**] hypotensive episodes.
# Respiratory failure:  Patient was intubated during code situation, extubated [**11-19**].
Extubation c/b acute on chronic CHF.
Subsequent intubation in the context of hospital acquired pneumonia and sepsis.
# CHF: Acute on chronic CHF exacerbation.
Appeared slightly fluid overloaded in the setting of sepsis.
home lasix d/ced as pt has not been volume overloaded.
# COPD: He has a history of copd with long smoking history.
Albuterol d/ced [**2-5**] cardiac recs that it may be contributing to patients runs of atrial tachycardia.
Acetylcysteine added to regimen, aggressive chest PT and inspirative spirometry.
# Mesenteric ischemia: His small bowel resection was in [**Month (only) 205**] [**2179**], and his abdominal wound was closed shortly thereafter.
The wound itself appears to okay, though there is some increased purulence at the proximal aspect.
Dr.[**Name (NI) 15146**] team evaluated the wound and thought it was healing well.
# GIB:  Pt w/ melanotic Stools and known UGI AVMs, considered likely source.
Pts HCT remained stable with a plan to transfuse PRBCs to HCT 30 given recent myocardial ischemia, stools guaiaced (no rebleed) and pt continued on pantoprazole.
