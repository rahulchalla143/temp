CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2110-4-12**] 11:48 AM  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  Reason: re evalplease perform at noon  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 29 year old woman with small sub arachnoid hem.
INDICATION: 29-year-old woman with small subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Tiny foci of hyperdensity in the left parietal lobe near the vertex again identified but less pronounced.
Also seen is the curvilinear hyperdensity in the region of the left frontal lobe, which is less prominent than previous.
No hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, or acute major vascular territorial infarct identified.
There is minor mucosal thickening in both maxillary sinuses and an air-fluid level and maxillary thickening in the sphenoid sinus.
Scattered ethmoid air cells are also opacified.
IMPRESSION: Slightly less prominent foci of hyperdensity in the left parietal and left frontal regions.
No new foci of hemorrhage.
Acute comminuted fracture of the nasal processes of maxillary bone as well as nasal bone, associated with soft tissue swelling and soft tissue defect.
Hematoma in the right abdominal wall along the oblique muscles, surrounded by fat stranding, due to recent trauma.
Small amount of free fluid in lower pelvis, which measures approximately 25 [**Doctor Last Name **], however, the density evaluation is somewhat limited due to artifact.
The fluid can be physiologic, however, in the presence of recent trauma, hemorrhagic fluid cannot be totally excluded.
CT c spine: IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture or dislocation.
No comparison.
FINDINGS: Note is made of a small amount of hyperdensity along the sulci of left parietal lobe, worrisome for subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Note is made of slight hyperintensity along the sulci of left frontal lobe, also worrisome for hemorrhage.
Note is made of several other areas of hyperdensity along the sulci bilaterally, which can be artifactual, however, can represent hemorrhage.
No mass effect is seen.
No definite shift of normally midline structures.
Noted soft tissue swelling in the frontal area, with comminuted nasal bone fracture.
IMPRESSION: Hyperdensity along the sulci of left parietal and frontal lobes, worrisome for subarachnoid hemorrhage given the recent trauma.
Subcutaneous hematoma with comminuted nasal fracture.
SHOULDER (AP, NEUTRAL & AXILLARY) SOFT TISSUE LEFT  [**2110-4-13**] 2:47 PM  SHOULDER (AP, NEUTRAL & AXILLA  Reason: eval shoulder injury  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 29 year old woman with mult inj s/p MVa with shoulder pain REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: eval shoulder injury HISTORY: Multiple injections status post MVA with shoulder pain, evaluate shoulder injury.
Allowing for this, no fracture is detected involving the right shoulder.
If clinical suspicion for dislocation remains high, then an axillary or Y view could help for further assessment.
Note: No dislocation was seen on the [**2110-4-12**] CT scan.
follow up Head CT: CONCLUSION: Interval development of fairly extensive subdural fluid collections which either represent hygromas or chronic hematomas.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient had her facial wounds fixed by the plastic and reconstructive surgery team.
A follow up head CT showed no major change, and the patient's mental status improved.
Outpatient Occupational Therapy Outpatient OT for cognitive training   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: s/p Motor vehicle crash Left subarachnoid hemorrhage Nasal fractures  Discharge Condition: Stable  Discharge Instructions: Continue your Dilantin for the next 4 days.
Followup Instructions: Call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2731**] for an appointment with Neurosurgery in 4 weeks, inform the office that you will need a repeat head CT scan for this appointment.
See your dentist within two weeks for your loose tooth.
