Per EMS, a witness saw shaking and loss of consciousness at some point peri-accident (is not clear from EMS notes).
In the ED, he had a 6cm head lac in the posterior occipital region stapled.
There was also a right lac above the eyebrow.
No prior h/o seizure or syncope.
Past Medical History: BPH, ?Prostate Ca, Radioactive seeds in prostate Bilateral hernia repair Surgical repair of peptic ulcer Hard of hearing Hypercholesterolemia  Social History: lives with wife, former [**Name2 (NI) 29497**], delivers meals to elderly people now.

No pneumothorax.
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2176-1-9**] IMPRESSION: Interval significant increase in amount of right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
CT ABD/PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2176-1-9**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture, hematoma or soft organ injury.
Multiple simple renal cysts on the right.
Focal low-attenuation areas within the left kidney that are too small to characterize.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2176-1-9**] IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of fracture.
Degenerative disease of the cervical spine as described.
Slight enlargement of right frontal parenchymal hemorrhage.
Unchanged appearance of multiple regions of subarachnoid blood, including the left frontal, right frontal, and right parietal lobes.
Mild mucosal thickening/opacification of the ethmoid air cells is again seen.
CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE  [**2176-1-10**] IMPRESSION: Bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.
EEG Study Date of [**2176-1-10**] IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG obtained in drowsiness and early stage II sleep due to the presence of slow and disorganized background with bursts of generalized slowing in the delta frequency range.
This finding suggests an excessively drowsy recording or deep, midline subcortical dysfunction in is consistent with a mild encephalopathy.
No lateralizing or epileptiform abnormalities were seen.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2176-1-11**] IMPRESSION: The right frontal lobe parenchymal hematoma appears slightly larger than on the previous studies.
There is also improved visualization of a focus of hemorrhage in the medial right posterior parietal lobe.
MRA HEAD/BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2176-1-11**] IMPRESSION: Multiple areas of hemorrhage as described similar to the CT scan of [**2176-1-11**].
IMPRESSION: No evidence of aneurysm or flow abnormality.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2176-1-16**] IMPRESSION: 1) No significant interval change in right frontal hemorrhagic contusion and right subdural hygroma.
2) Minimal increase in size of left subdural hygroma.
Slightly prominent right hilar nodes.
Bibasilar opacities with tiny effusions, possibly atelectasis, although infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical scenario.
The left lower lobe opacity appears somewhat more consolidative than the right.
Likewise patchy right middle lobe opacity, which could represent early pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2176-1-21**] IMPRESSION: No gallstones.
No evidence of acute cholecystitis.
No interval change in right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage and bilateral subdural hygromas.
There is a small enhancing lesion along the superior aspect of the left lesser sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**], which likely represents a meningioma.
EEG Study Date of [**2176-1-23**] IMPRESSION: Possibly abnormal EEG due to the excessive amount of sleep observed in this tracing.
In the absence of sedative-type medication or prolonged wakefulness prior to the recording, the excessive degree of sleepiness seen in this record might suggest an early encephalopathy.
No intra-abdominal or intrapelvic abscess.
A low-density lesion in the right gluteus maximus muscle.
This may represent a hematoma or an evolving infectious process.
There is no drainable fluid at this time.
Consider ultrasound if further followup of this lesion is desired since it is quite superficial.
CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST  [**2176-1-23**] IMPRESSION: Mild mucosal thickening.
No evidence of air- fluid levels or bone destruction.
U/S EXT VEINS  [**2176-1-25**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.
IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis seen in the venous system of the distal portion of the upper extremity.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2176-1-30**] IMPRESSIONS: Markedly improved lung volumes and infiltrates, but followup for the persistent right lower lobe opacity recommended.

1) Head injury:  Head imaging with frontal contusion, SAH and intraparenchymal bleed as detailed in reports above.
His mental status unfortunately deteriorated shortly after presentation, likely due to significant edema s/p trauma.
He is currently able to squeeze right hand to command, no use of his left upper extremity.

- f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] post rehab discharge - staples removed from head without complication [**2176-1-25**]  2) Fever: Though to be secondary to aspiration PNA.
[**1-17**] noted to have new fever and rash so Zosyn switched to levo/flagyl/Vancomycin.
