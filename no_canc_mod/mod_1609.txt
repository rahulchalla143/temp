Admission Date:  [**2194-9-19**]       Discharge Date:  [**2194-9-26**]  Date of Birth:   [**2123-8-4**]       Sex:  F  Service:  MICU  DIAGNOSIS:  Myocardial infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, meningitis.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71 year old Vietnamese female with a past medical history significant for hypertension who was transferred from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10315**] Hospital in [**State 2748**] for Intensive Care Unit management.
The patient originally presented to the outside hospital on [**9-14**], noting chest heaviness that began that morning.
The chest pain progressively worsened throughout the day.
Her initial electrocardiogram showed ST elevations in the inferior leads consistent with an acute inferior myocardial infarction.
She also had some bradycardia and hypertension along with transient high-grade heartblock.
Her ST segment elevation resolved and the patient was painfree and kept on intravenous heparin.
Later that evening/early morning at 2 AM she was noted to have acute mental status changes.
Head computerized tomography scan showed intracranial hemorrhage primarily in the third and fourth ventricles extending into the lateral ventricles, resulting in mild hydrocephaly.
Neurosurgery was consulted and placed a ventriculostomy with drainage tube to monitor her intracranial pressure.
The patient was noted to be comatose and unresponsive at the time of bleed.
Throughout the hospitalization she had minimal neurological improvement.
She had occasional movement of her head to the left, positive corneal reflexes, positive Doll's eyes and pupils equal and reactive to light with minimal withdrawal of the pain.
The patient's course at the outside hospital was also complicated by low-grade fevers for which she was placed on Ancef.
The family chose to transfer the patient to [**Hospital6 256**] for geographical reasons, as the patient is originally from [**Location (un) 86**] and has multiple family members living in the [**Name (NI) 86**] area.
Abdominal hysterectomy.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Coarse breathsounds, no wheezes or crackles.
Extremities, warm and dry, no clubbing, edema or cyanosis, 2+ distal pulses.
Neurological, comatose, unresponsive with flaccid extremities, withdraws extremities times four to severe pain, 1+ deep tendon reflexes.
Electrocardiogram, normal sinus rhythm 65, ST elevation in 3 and AVF.
Chest x-ray, no focal infiltrates or increased pulmonary congestion.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Assessment and plan - A 71 year old Vietnamese female with inferior myocardial infarction who received thrombolytic therapy at an outside hospital and then presented with an intracranial hemorrhage with bleeding into the ventricles, now comatose.
Intracranial hemorrhage - The patient with intracranial hemorrhage following thrombolytic therapy.
A repeat computerized tomography scan of the head on the day of discharge showed decreased blood and improved hydrocephalus.
The patient's blood pressures were closely monitored throughout the hospitalization, initially she was maintained on systolic blood pressure of 130 to 140 and then one week out from the bleed the blood pressure was further lowered in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction.
Inferior myocardial infarction - The patient originally presented to the outside hospital on [**9-14**] with inferior myocardial infarction and she was started on beta blocker, ACE inhibitor and statin at the outside hospital along with a Nitroglycerin drip.
Initial repeat electrocardiogram showed continued ST elevation in the inferior leads, however, this resolved over hospitalization.
The patient had no acute episodes of chest pain.
She was not given aspirin or any other anticoagulation in the setting of her acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Multiple blood, urine and sputum cultures were sent as was the urinalysis and chest x-ray.
Given the sparse growth of organism it was thought that this was more likely a contaminate, particularly given the lack of significant chest x-ray changes.
She did have some questionable left lower lobe infiltrate versus atelectasis but no gross infiltrates.
The patient continued to spike temperatures and was started on antibiotic therapy on [**9-22**].
She continued to spike on this regimen and suspicion grew for a possible meningitis or other intracranial infectious process, particularly given her recent proceduration.
The patient was placed on a higher dose of Ceptaz that would cover firm meningeal infection and Vancomycin was also added.
Infectious Disease was consulted and agreed with these recommendations.
She later had an lumbar puncture after approval for safety from Neurology which showed both red cells and white cells thought to be consistent with an inflammatory versus infectious process.
Respiratory failure - The patient was intubated at the outside hospital for aortic reduction at the time of intracranial bleed.
Anemia - Hematocrit was low on admission, thought to be due to intracranial hemorrhage, although baseline hematocrit was unknown.
She had a brief episode of hyponatremia for a 24 hour period which was quickly resolved without any intervention.
She had mild hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia which were repleted and thought to be due to dietary deficiencies.
Prophylaxis - The patient on Lansoprazole for gastrointestinal prophylaxis.
No subcutaneous heparin was given in the setting of her acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Intracranial hemorrhage 2.
Inferior myocardial infarction 3.
