Recurrent myocardial infarction in 4/00.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which shows total occlusion of his left inferior mammary artery to left anterior descending and saphenous vein graft.
Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, status post ICD placement in [**6-2**], complicated by pocket infection in [**7-4**], requiring ICD removal.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline 1.4.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Social History: 45 pack yr h/o smoking, quit [**2180**].No EtOH/drugs  Family History: Mother MI, CVA  Physical Exam: temp 99.8, BP 110/60, HR 78, R 20, O2 91% on 4L Gen: NAD, lying in bed flat, AO x 3, speaking in full sentences without use of accessory muscles HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MM dry Neck: no JVP noted CV: RRR, distant heart sounds, no murmurs Pulm: diffuse insp and exp wheezes, increased E:I Abd: obese, soft, nontender Ext: no edema, 1+ DP bilaterally   Pertinent Results: [**2186-12-17**] 08:20PM   GLUCOSE-113* UREA N-62* CREAT-1.8* SODIUM-145 POTASSIUM-4.2 CHLORIDE-95* TOTAL CO2-37* ANION GAP-17 .
CXR: There is persistent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, with associated compression atelectasis of the right middle lobe.
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen.
There is mild vascular fullness, but no definite evidence of CHF.
A new left-sided IJ catheter is in place, without pneumothorax.
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent, consistent with mild atrophy.
There is no evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarction.
Bone windows show clear paranasal sinuses with no evidence of fracture.
No significant soft tissue swelling is seen.
Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe regional systolic dysfunction.
The basal half of the septum contracts best.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with prominent free wall hypokinesis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
MS changes: Given pt's waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, a head CT was done and ruled out bleed and urine and blood tox labs were sent and all returned negative.
Differential diagnosis also included infection, though there was no clear source, hypercarbia and overmedication with percocet.
Etiology was likely hypercarbia and by hospital day #[**1-4**], his mental status had improved.
Respiratory failure was likely multifactorial, due to combination of COPD with recent URI, overuse of narcotics and not using CPAP while at home.
He was initally given IV solumedrol for his COPD exacerbation and then transitioned to po steroids.
Pt with chronic respiratory acidosis with baseline pCO2 likely in the 60s-70s.
VT s/p AICD placement: Pt had frequent episodes of NSVT and longer runs requiring ATP.
An echocardiogram during admission showed severely depressed systolic function with an EF of 20%.
His medications were restarted later during his hospital stay when he became euvolemic and he was continued on Lasix (decreased from his regular home dose), ACE-I and toprol.
His zaroxylyn was held due to his hypovolemic status on admission.
CAD: Given his NSVT, cardiac enzymes were checked to rule out coronary causes.
ARF: On admission, creatinine elevated to 1.9 likely secondary to hypovolemia.
A FeUrea was consistent with a pre-renal picture so pt was given gentle IVF.
DM: Pt's glucose was elevated while on steroids so his glipizide was increased and his sliding scale tightened.
Back Pain: Pt's narcotics were discontinued on admission [**1-3**] his altered mental status and were not restarted during his hospital stay.
