Admission Date:  [**2160-5-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2160-5-8**]  Date of Birth:  [**2141-12-21**]             Sex:   M  Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**] Chief Complaint: Status epilepticus  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Mechanical ventilation EEG   History of Present Illness: [**Known firstname **] is an 18 year old boy with a history of Lafora body disease (a progressive myoclonic epilepsy), who is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 72801**] at [**Hospital3 1810**], and who was transferred from the [**Hospital3 **] ED where he presented with status epilepticus the morning of admission.
His anticonvulsant regimen consists of Keppra 2250 mg in the AM and 2500 mg in the PM, Depakote 750 mg TID, and Clobazam 10 mg at 8:30, 10 mg at 1 p.m., 15 mg at 8;30 p.m., and 20 mg at 10 p.m.  During the week prior to admission he has had increasing frequency of his generalized tonic clonic seizures, with four seizures on [**4-28**], three on [**4-29**], and one on [**4-30**].
All of these seizures lasted a few minutes at a time and self-resolved without intervention.
He was also having visual hallucinations during this period, complaining that there was something on top of his head.
Then on [**5-3**] while at his father's house he had two further generalized tonic clonic seizures, and had another two seizures on [**5-4**].
His parents were able to calm him and he did not have a seizure, however.
It was his last day of high school, but as soon as he walked into the building at 8:30 or 9 a.m., he had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.
He was given 2 mg Ativan IV, then became hypoxemic with saturations in the 70's.
The decision was made to intubate him after discussion with his parents, and this was done at about 10:30 a.m.
By the time of transfer here, [**Known firstname **] had stopped seizing, and has had no further seizure activity.
He has not recently been systemically ill, with no fevers, respiratory symptoms, vomiting, or diarrhea.
Review of systems:  No recent fever, weight loss, cough, rhinorrhea, shortness of breath, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash.
He sprained his right ankle a couple of days ago (x-ray revealed no fracture) and has had some edema of the area overlying the right medial malleolus.
Past Medical History: Lafora body disease - diagnosed at age 13 when he developed intractable seizures and progressive encephalopathy; followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 72801**] at [**Hospital3 1810**].
Speech is dysarthric and gait unstable at baseline, able to eat po but needs help with all ADL's including toileting, bathing, dressing.
Family History: No other history of Lafora body disease.
Physical Exam: Exam on arrival T 99.8   HR 82   BP 115/70  RR 14 Pulse Ox 100% on RA General appearance:  18 year old boy intubated and sedated in NAD HEENT:  NC/AT, neck supple CV: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended, no hsm or masses palpated Extremities: Mild edema in area overlying right medial malleolus  Mental Status: Intubated, eyes closed, no eye opening spontanouesly, to voice, or to noxious stimuli.
No oculocephalic reflexes present.
No spontaneous movement, withdraws left arm and leg vigorously to noxious stimuli, right arm and leg readily but less vigorously.
2-3 beats of clonus at both ankles.
Strong response with head turning to nasal tickle bilaterally.
Head CT ([**5-6**]): No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
EEG ([**5-5**]): ABNORMALITY #1: There were frequent paroxysmal bursts of generalized delta frequency slowing, which last between 5 to 30 seconds, without any obvious change in behavior.
ABNORMALITY #2: The background was slow and disorganized reaching a maximum of [**3-20**] Hz posteriorly, with superimposed generalized beta frequency activity.
SLEEP: No normal transitions between wakefulness and drowsiness were seen.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background with bursts of generalized slowing, suggestive of an encephalopathy.
The paroxysmal bursts of generalized slowing did not have any clinical correlate and likely suggest deep midline or subcortical dysfunction.
No clear epileptiform features or seizures were seen.
Generalized beta frequency activity seen is most likely due to medications such as benzodiazepines or barbituates.
Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 18 year old boy with Lafora body disease (progressive myoclonic epilepsy) followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 72801**] at [**Hospital1 **], presenting with status epilepticus, currently encephalopathic with minimal responsiveness but no longer seizing.
There is no clear trigger for this episode; he had increased activity and likely stress, as well as change in sleep cycle, but no infection or medication noncompliance.
This may be part of his progressive underlying disease.
He was placed on bedside EEG, which throughout his course has shown encephalopathy and intermittent spikes (most prominent in L frontocentral and R frontocentral, as well as polyspikes), but no electrographic seizures.
However, he has remained unresponsive except to noxious.
He was noted to have a persistently high phenobarbital level over the first several days, which has likely contributed.
Hospital course was complicated by aspiration pneumonia in the left lower lobe, for which he was started on zosyn and clindamycin on [**5-7**].
He required several IV fluid boluses for slightly lower BPs or decreased urine output.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1810**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Lafora Body Disease Status post status epilepticus Encephalopathy Aspiration pneumonia   Discharge Condition: Unresponsive to voice, no eye opening.
