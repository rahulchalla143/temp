BLOOD CMV AB [**2164-5-17**]:                             **FINAL REPORT [**2164-5-18**]**     CMV IgG ANTIBODY (Final [**2164-5-18**]):       POSITIVE FOR CMV IgG ANTIBODY BY EIA.
CMV IgM ANTIBODY (Final [**2164-5-18**]):       NEGATIVE FOR CMV IgM ANTIBODY BY EIA.
INTERPRETATION:  INFECTION AT UNDETERMINED TIME.
A positive IgG result generally indicates past exposure.
Infection with CMV once contracted remains latent and may reactivate       when immunity is compromised.
Greatly elevated serum protein with IgG levels >[**2153**] mg/dl may cause       interference with CMV IgM results.
SKIN BX PATHOLOGY [**2164-5-14**]: DIAGNOSIS:    Skin, right anterior pannus, biopsy:  - Superficial perivascular lymphoplasmacytic inflammation with vasculopathy, fibrin microthrombi, and viral cytopathic effects of endothelial cells consistent with infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV), see note.
- Focal subcorneal mild acantholysis, see note.
Note: The sections show some residual and focal split of the keratinocytes at the uppermost epidermal layers, consistent with resolving pemphigus foliaceus.
The upper papillary dermis, however, shows a predominantly perivascular plasmacytic infiltrate, damaged capillaries with fibrin microthrombi, and a few large endothelial cells with marked cytopathic effects consistent with CMV infection.
No viral cytopathic effects of HSV seen on H&E or immunostains for HSV-1 and 2, and immunostain for CMV is non-contributory.
Findings are consistent with CMV infection in the setting of resolving pemphigus foliaceus.

# Pemphigus foliaceus with HSV/CMV superinfection: Dermatology and wound care were consulted.
Biopsy pathology was consistent with disseminated HSV.
Skin lesions also grew pseudomonas and proteus which were felt to be colonizing and given no systemic symptoms were treated with skin care including acetic acid only.
ID recommended against prophylaxis treatment for pseudomonas colonizing the skin.
When pemphigoid lesions appeared [**2164-5-18**], prednisone was increased back to 70mg daily and valgancyclovir started -- in the case that she failed prednisone, because Rituxan would be the next treatment for pemphigous and it was thought better to empirically treat the CMV before Rituxan if needed.
Viral load CMV came back mildly positive.
Atovaquone, Pantoprazole, and Vitamin D for prevention of complications from chronic high dose Prednisone.
# Hypercalcemia: Hypercalcemia upon admission.
Pt had a lot of insensible fluid loss when the skin lesions were at their worst.
# Chronic diastolic heart failure: Lasix .
# Diabetes mellitus, type 2, with hyperglycemia from Prednisone: Endocrine assisted in adjusting insulin regimen.
# Chronic kidney disease, stage 3, previous baseline Cr 1.3-1.5.
Now Cr only 0.7, but suspect that this is not from improved renal function but rather severe atrophy of muscle from being bedridden.
# Stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer (present on admission): Dermatology thinks this may actually be from her skin disease.
# Bacterial Vaginosis: noted and treatment started (Flagyl 500mg [**Hospital1 **]) on [**2164-5-21**] for 1 week.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for management of your skin disease which is Pemphigus Foliaceus with Herpes Simplex Virus and Cytomegalovirus superinfection.
You were managed with antiviral therapy, Prednisone, and expert wound care.
Other issues that were address are briefly described below:  # Hypercalcemia (high calcium level in blood) likely from a condition called hyperparathyroidism.
# Diabetes mellitus, type 2 exacerbated by Prednisone.
# Chronic diastolic heart failure was stable during the hospitalization.
# Hypothermia.
You have no other abnormal vital signs.
