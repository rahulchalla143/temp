Admission Date:  [**2200-2-20**]              Discharge Date:   [**2200-3-10**]  Date of Birth:  [**2143-6-22**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**] Chief Complaint: obtunded  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Lumbar Punctures x 4 Left frontal sinus drainage   History of Present Illness: 57F H/O Hypothyroidism who presented with unresponsiveness and meningitis.
The patient was feeling well, but then developed URI symptoms (fevers, headache, ear pain) four day prior to admission.
She then had persistent myalgias and nausea with worsening headaches over one to two days PTA> She felt very "cold" the night PTA when she asked her husband to turn up the heat.
The patient had no previous HIB or Pneumococcal vaccination.
There was no rash, bruising, or mouth sores.
Her husband had a mild "cold" a few days before her.
HEENT: R PRRL, L prosthesis; + photophobia Neck: + neck stiffness Heart: RRR, S1, S2, no m/r/g LUngs; CTBLA, no rales or wheezing ABd: S/NT/ND/no masses Ext: no edema Derm: no rash Neuro: R PRRL, uncooperative, opens L eye to command, moves feet to command to move feet or arms, nonverbal, flipped over in the prone position during examination.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs [**Last Name (STitle) 61064**] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with obtundation after several days of URI symptoms - she was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
A CSF examination revealed Hemophilus influenza meningitis and she was cotniued on Ceftriaxone, after Vancomycin and Acyclovir were discontinued.
However, her course was complicated by persistent fatigue, hyponatremia (deemed secondary to meningitis-related SIADH), fever, leukocytosis and an inflammatory CSF.
Follow-up head imaging showed a right frontal sinus opacification with possible right frontal osteomyeltis.
Her fevers persisted and no clear alternate source of infection was found - in her liver, blood, urine (although she had urine with yeast and no signs of inflammation), or chest.
Bacterial Meningitis/Fever: Again, the patient presented with obtundation and an inflammatory CSF after URI symptoms.
Although she improved neurologically, she had persistent fever and increased serum WBCs.
Repeat-LPs showed increased CSF WBCs (to 2500).
She also had persistent tachycardia, presumed secondary to fever.
Head and spine imaging showed opacification of the left frontal sinus, possible frontal osteomyelitis and possible underlying meningeal enhancement, but no abscesses.
Her distal thecal sac and cauda equina were markedly enhancing and her cauda equina nerve roots were markedly thickened.
These findings were consistent with meningitis.
Of note, no purulent material drained from her sinus; she had only marked mucosal edema.
A repeat CSF cytology showed decreasing WBC and increasing glucose, indicating overall improving meningitis.
Her persistent fever was thought to be [**1-8**] drug fever from meropenem, as a screen for other sources of infection  (UA/UCXR/BCXR/CXR/Liver CT) was negative.
Given signs of improving meningitis by CSF studies and likely drug fever from meropenem, meropenem was d/c and the pt was placed back on levoflox with good effect.
Fever resolved after 48 hours off meropenem, and there no signs of active infection after starting levoflox.
At the time of d/c, the pt has been afebrile > 48 hours and is near her neurologic baseline on levoflox.
Hyponatremia: She was euvolemic to hypovolemic and had a hypotonic serum.
Her clinical picture and urine electrolytes were consitent with SIADH in setting of meningitis.
She improved slightly with fluid restriction but also required small boluses of hypertonic saline.
LDH/ALK PHOS/AST Elevation: She had an incidental rise in these values in the middle of her course.
It was possibly related to high-dose Levofloxacin liver toxicity.
An abdominal CT was negative for abscess.
She was seen by surgery and a likely congenital (Bochdalek) diaphragatic hernia was diagnosed, without obvious lung aplasia or dysfunction.
She was slotted for follow-up with surgery as an outpatient for possible elective correction.
Hearing loss: she has bilateral hearing loss at the time of d/c, likely [**1-8**] meningitis.
ENT recommends audiological evaluation after d/c, w/ close follow-up for 6 months after resolution of meningitis.
She will f/u in [**Hospital **] clinic after d/c for ongoing evaluation.

3) Return to the Emergency Department immediately if you develop confusion, trouble breathing, chest pain or severe headache.
Call your doctor if you have a temperature higher than 101 degrees F.  Followup Instructions: Audiology (Hearing) testing - [**4-1**], 1:45 pm at Dr. [**Name (NI) 61066**] office, [**Hospital **] Medical Building, [**Location (un) 61067**].
