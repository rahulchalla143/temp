Pregnancy complicated by ultrasound finding of 13 mm ventricular dilatation at 13 weeks.
Consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37123**] at the [**Hospital3 1810**] noted on the day of delivery to have increased ventricular dilatation at 33 mm on MRI and proceeded to cesarean section delivery under spinal anesthesia.
This pregnancy was also complicated by oligohydramnios and E. coli UTI.
No labor or fever.
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Infant in no distress.
Mild nasal flaring.
Chest:  No retractions.
Good bilateral breath sounds, no crackles.
Abdomen is soft, nondistended, no organomegaly, no masses, and bowel sounds active, patent anus.
Baby has had no apnea, bradycardia, or desaturations.
Cardiovascular:  Baby has had no murmur.
Baby has had no hypoglycemia.
There has been no hypoglycemia during admission.
Family has been educated as to signs of hypoglycemia with examples including jitteriness and lethargy.
Their recommendation would be to consider stress dose steroids if infant becomes ill or requires surgery.
A urine CMV was sent due to its known association with congenital hydrocephalus and aqueductal stenosis.
There has been no isolation of CMV in this specimen to date.
Neurology:  Baby had a head ultrasound on [**4-2**], which showed normal brain parenchyma, moderate-to-marked lateral ventricle dilatation, bilateral absent septum pellucidum, and normal fourth ventricle.
MRI on [**4-6**] showed aqueductal stenosis, partial absence of the septum pellucidum, and thinned corporis callosum.
The neurology service has asked that a L1CAM mutation sent for analysis as this has been associated with congenital hydrocephalus and aqueductal stenosis and may have prognostic value.
Ophthalmology examination was done on [**4-9**] prior to discharge, which showed no optic nerve hypoplasia.
Consider stress-dose steroids if baby has symptoms of illness and/or surgery until pituitary status is confirmed.
Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) 359**] through [**Month (only) 547**] for infants who meet any of the following three criteria:  1) Born at less than 32 weeks, 2) born between 32 and 35 weeks with two of three of the following: daycare during RSV season, a smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities, or with school-age siblings, or 3) with chronic lung disease.
Before this age and for the first 24 hours months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out of home caregivers.
Congenital hydrocephalus.
Aqueductal stenosis.
Partial absence of the septum pellucidum and thinned corporis callosum.
Status post rule out sepsis, no antibiotics.
Breech presentation.
