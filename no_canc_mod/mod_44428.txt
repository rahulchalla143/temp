Admission Date:  [**2137-12-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2137-12-14**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-4-8**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Amiodarone / Monosodium Glutamate  Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**] Chief Complaint: respiratory disress and hypotension  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 656**] is a 76yo gentleman who had recent redo repair of thoracic aortic dissection with a course complicated by staph bacteremia and post operative seizures who was transferred from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with respiratory distress and hypotension.
Yesterday, he became more drowsy and developed a fever to 102.4, and zosyn was started.
Overnight, he had a large bowel movement and then shortly after he became tachypneic (40-50s) and his oxygen saturation dropped to 88% on FiO2 of 35%.
There was minimal output from his cholecystostomy tube.
A CT torso was performed which showed LLL collapse and tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacification of the right lung fields with no intraabdominal pathology and no PE.
Unable to obtain review of systems secondary to mental status.
Past Medical History: Type A aortic dissection in [**2132**] s/p replacement aortic arch, resuspension of aortic valve, coronary artery bypass graft x1 s/p coil embolization of his left internal iliac aneurysm [**2136**] CTA in [**2137-9-3**] showed increase in size of aorta to 6.3cm, hence [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] planned redo repair in [**2137-10-3**] with replacement of ascending aorta and arch with graft  - developed seizures post-op, neurology felt this was sign of anoxic cerebral insult  - found to have E faecalis bacteremia  - LLL PNA with Cx growing serratia and E Coli  - left chest tube placed for pleural effusion  - right IJ thrombosis found during line placement  - hematuria felt to be due to Foley trauma while on coumadin; required CBI and followed by urology  - had trach and GJ tube [**10/2137**]  - [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] work-up with bronch for possible TBM, which was negative  - slow neurologic improvement, at time of discharge: "he was able to follow commands- he was able to open his eyes, grasp my fingers, and stick out his tongue.
He was not moving his limbs other than moving his toes and fingers and was not antigravity, he was areflexic"  - dc'd to rehab [**11-11**] on trach collar with CPAP Readmitted [**Date range (1) 104398**] with fever and seizures  - coag negative staph bacteremia from PICC line  - found to have Cholecystitis but not felt to be operative candidate, so had percutaneous choleycystostomy tube  - left subclavian DVT noted [**11-22**]  - dc'd back to rehab with plan for 6 weeks of vancomycin and return in [**1-4**] months for cholecystectomy pAFib s/p ablation [**7-/2137**], on coumadin s/p PPM for tachy-brady syndrome HTN Hyperlipidemia PVD Anemia, felt to be due to chronic disease h/o CHF with preserved EF Diverticulosis Benign prostatic hyperplasia Spinal Stenosis   Social History: Was living at [**Hospital **] rehab.
Does not track movements or sounds.
CARDIAC: Irregularly irregular and tachycardic, no murmurs or rubs LUNGS:  Moving air well anteriorly with some coarse breath sounds; left base has somewhat bronchial breath sounds.
ABDOMEN:  Obese but soft, does not wince even with deep palpation, per chole tube in place with small amount of bilious drainage.
++right>left UE edema, but no LE edema.
No tremors or myoclonus observed.
250cc concentrated yellow urine in Foley.
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2137-12-12**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an abbreviated       workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates recovered from       this site.

Evidence of occlusion involving the bilateral subclavian veins with no central access available for catheter placement.
CXR [**12-3**]:  Left basilar consolidation, likely reflecting lower lobe collapse and left pleural effusion, similar to the comparison study.
CT Torso [**12-3**] : CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: The pulmonary arterial system is well opacified and there is no embolic filling defect.
Lungs are notable for intralobular septal thickening and scattered areas of ground-glass density.
A left pleural effusion is slightly larger than on the comparison study.
There is no right pleural effusion.
Nevertheless, there are areas of poorly marginated nodular type of opacity, which is new from the comparison study (3A:39), as well as areas of tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] type opacities, also progressed from the previous study and together suggestive of infection.
Note is made of bibasilar atelectasis as well as a consolidation seen along the medial basal aspect of the right lower lobe.
There is no pericardial effusion.
The heart is notable for atherosclerotic calcification of the coronary arteries and a dual lead pacing device.
A large amount of fluid in the pericardial recesses is unchanged.
A descending thoracic aortic dissection persists.
There is no mediastinal or axillary lymphadenopathy.
The liver is notable for diffuse periportal edema.
Hypodensity in the left lobe (3B:A3) is too small to characterize and unchanged.
Near the edge of the liver in the right lobe is a 15 x 9 mm hyperdense lesion (3B:A2), which was not definitively seen on previous studies.
There is no free gas or free fluid in the abdomen.
There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
The true lumen appears to supply the celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery and right renal artery while the left renal artery originates from the false lumen.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The urinary bladder contains Foley catheter and a small amount of gas.
A metallic wire in the rectum may represent a temperature probe.
There is no free gas or fluid in the pelvis.
There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
There is a fat-containing left inguinal hernia.
The colon is notable for diverticulosis, with no evidence to suggest acute diverticulitis.
OSSEOUS FINDINGS: There is no suspicious sclerotic or lytic osseous lesion.
Degenerative changes are seen throughout the spine and involving both sacroiliac joints.
An old rib fracture deformity is seen in the right fourth rib posteriorly as well as in the right first rib posteriorly.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Large left pleural effusion with associated collapse of the left lower lobe.
The lungs also reveal scattered consolidations as described above and poorly marginated nodular type opacities which are new and short interval and likely also infectious.
Suggestion of hypervolemia with intralobular septal thickening in the lungs as well as periportal edema.
Hepatic hyperdensity in the right lobe as above.
A similar hyperdensity was seen in [**2136-8-3**].
Considerations include a hemangioma, or possible AV-malformation (?previous biopsy site).
EEG [**12-4**]: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations and no ictal or interictal epileptiform activity.
The background activity was slow with additional bursts of generalized slowing suggestive of a moderate encephalopathy involving both cortical and subcortical structures.
Although there were no areas of prominent focal slowing seen in this recording, subtle asymmetries may be difficult to discern in a generally slow recording.
TEE [**11-19**]: No valvular vegetations or masses.
Brief Hospital Course: 76yo gentleman who is s/p redo replacement aortic arch with presumed anoxic brain injury and post-op bacteremia as well as cholecystitis s/p cholecystosomy admitted for sepsis.
# Respiratory Failure:  At first, likely secondary to infectious process.
Vancomycin was held on the day of discharge because of an elevated vancomycin level to 28.1.
Barriers to extubation at discharge included muscle weakness and pulmonary edema.
We elected to keep patient off of lasix drip on day of discharge because Cr was elevated, but think that the patient is total body volume overloaded and would benefit from further diuresis.
# Sepsis: Found to have serratia bacteremia on OSH culture and then had sputum with GNR on [**12-10**].
Could also be due to pneumonia or due to PICC line infection, so PICC line was removed and replaced with a midline.
# Acute renal failure: Felt to be a combination of ATN and hypovolemia given small amount of granular casts.
Patient often complained of discomfort related to the foley site though it was felt to be necessary due to BPH and hematuria.
At the time of discharge, patient's Creatinine was trending up, and this was felt to be most likely secondary to intravascular depletion from diuresis (although he remains total body volume overloaded).
# Fever: Patient spiked fevers during admission, and as a result his femoral line (placed during admission) was pullled on [**12-10**].
Other possible sources of infection included pulmonary and GU, as well as a possible infected pulmonary effusion.
# Altered mental status and h/o Seizures and Likely Anoxic Cerebral Injury:  At admission, patient was evaluated by neurology who felt no current evidence of seizure activity but he does have a history of non-convulsive status epilepticus.
EEG neg for seizure so likely due to hypotension, possibly oversedation from anti-epileptic medications.
# Hypercalcemia: Resolved during admission and was likely secondary to renal failure.
# Hematuria and BPH:  Was described at rehab [**12-2**]  Patient was followed by urology during recent hospital stay and was started on flomax.
Continued to have some hematuria during this hospitalization, has 3 way foley and undergoing bladder irrigation.
Likely due to anticoagulation in the setting of foley placements.
# Atrial Fibrillation and UE DVTs:  INR was supratherapeutic to at 4.0 on the day of discharge.
(Coumadin and Phenobarbital interact and it will likely be difficult to achieve optimal therapeutic levels of the two medications; they should be monitored closely).
# Anemia:  Hct remained relatively stable, though patient did require 1U PRBC during admission.
Note that patient required multiple transfusions during recent hospital stay and he has guaiac positive stool as well as recent hematuria.
# Recent Cholecystitis:   Was not felt to be the etiology of his sepsis per surgery.
# S/p Aortic arch repair/dissection/CABG:  No acute issues.
# h/o diastolic heart failure: Patient was maintained on prn Lasix and then a Lasix drip given episodes of hypotension.
# Elevated troponin and EKG changes: Suspect patient was somewhat ischemic in setting of hypotension and tachycardia at admission.
# Infiltrated IV site: Patient had an infiltrated IV site at admission.
Pain improved over time though the right arm continued to be ecchymotic and edematous at discharge.
Was treated with hot compresses, with some improvement.

Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnoses: Bacteremia Respiratory failure Acute Renal Failure Diastolic CHF Atrial fibrillation Pleural effusion  Secondary Diagnoses: Cholecystitis Aortic dissection s/p graft repair Tachy-brady syndrome s/p pacemaker Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Peripheral Vascular Disease Anemia, felt to be due to chronic disease Diverticulosis Benign prostatic hyperplasia Spinal Stenosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair Hemodynamically stable Ventilator dependent but able to tolerate trach collar for short periods of time (up to several hours)   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for respiratory distress and low blood pressure thought to be related to an infection in your blood.
Additionally, you had a decline in your renal function during the course of your hospitalization, likely related to receiving contrast for a CT scan at admission to the hospital and then receiving medications (Lasix) to help remove the IV fluids.
Your goal Dilantin level is [**6-11**], once corrected for low albumin.
