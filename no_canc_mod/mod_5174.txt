At that time he had epigastirc and RUQ tenderness to palpation.
His laboratory data showed increase in transaminases as well as in amylase and lipase.
on HD4 patient developed worsening of symptoms and some respiratory distress (CO2 retention).
His CT scan revelaed some inflamation around the pancreas as well as pseudocyst.
F/U CT of the abdomen revelaed huge pseudocyst and patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further mgt  Past Medical History: HTN CAD, s/p angioplasty s/p AVR [**7-6**] Respiratory failure tracheostomy Failure to thrive s/p R knee surgery ventilator associated pneumonia pancreatic pseudocyst Atrial fibrilation galstone pancreatitis picc line placement cholelithiasis COPD CHF sepsis  Social History: lives with his wife former tobacco use  Physical Exam: awake, following comands temp 99.1, hr 110, bp 147/71, 97% IMV HEENT: MM moist, no [**Last Name (LF) 34964**], [**First Name3 (LF) 13775**] EOMI, no lymphadenopathy Card: iregular heart rate, tachy, 2/5 SEM Resp: trach in place, bilateral ronchi and [**Doctor Last Name 34965**], occasional weezing Abd: soft, midly distended, non-tender to palpation, no bowel sounds rectal: no masses, guac negative Extr: warm, 2 plus edema both arms and legs Skin: no jaundice  Pertinent Results: [**2200-4-29**] 09:38PM   WBC-11.1* RBC-3.49* HGB-10.0* HCT-31.4* MCV-90 MCH-28.6 MCHC-31.8 RDW-14.6 [**2200-4-29**] 09:38PM   PLT COUNT-292# [**2200-4-29**] 09:38PM   PT-13.4* PTT-25.4 INR(PT)-1.2 [**2200-4-29**] 09:38PM   DIGOXIN-0.6* [**2200-4-29**] 09:38PM   ALBUMIN-2.5* CALCIUM-9.5 PHOSPHATE-3.7 MAGNESIUM-2.1 [**2200-4-29**] 09:38PM   LIPASE-26 [**2200-4-29**] 09:38PM   ALT(SGPT)-41* AST(SGOT)-48* LD(LDH)-180 ALK PHOS-364* AMYLASE-24 TOT BILI-1.1 [**2200-4-29**] 09:38PM   GLUCOSE-116* UREA N-30* CREAT-0.3* SODIUM-137 POTASSIUM-4.1 CHLORIDE-93* TOTAL CO2-41* ANION GAP-7* [**2200-4-29**] 10:56PM   freeCa-1.25 [**2200-4-29**] 10:56PM   GLUCOSE-122* LACTATE-0.9 [**2200-4-29**] 10:56PM   TYPE-ART PO2-95 PCO2-59* PH-7.44 TOTAL CO2-41* BASE XS-12 [**2200-4-29**] 11:15PM URINE  BLOOD-NEG NITRITE-NEG PROTEIN-NEG GLUCOSE-NEG KETONE-NEG BILIRUBIN-NEG UROBILNGN-1 PH-6.5 LEUK-NEG [**2200-4-29**] 11:15PM URINE  COLOR-Yellow APPEAR-Clear SP [**Last Name (un) 155**]-1.024  Brief Hospital Course: Neuro: Patient has received some sedation with Ativan and propofol during perioperative periods.
He showed some signs of depression and was started (and maintained) on Paxil his pain through the admission was controlled with morphine, fentanyl, Percocet Patient develop tremors in his arms and head, for which neurology consult was obtained and felt that it is an essential tremor, which does not need any treatment at this time Now: patient is alert, oriented to self and place, does not have pain, does not require any sedation, still has tremor  Cardiovascular: through out patient admission he remained in atrial fibrillation, with heart rate 80-100, controlled with Lopressor, blood pressure stable, His repeated echocardiogram showed stable EF of 55%, mild CHF and mild left ventricular outflow obstruction.
[**6-22**] - patient developed LUE DVT associated with catheter, catheter was removed  Respiratory: patient had BiPAP requiring sleep apnea at the base line.
By the time of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] he had prolong intubation course, with a few attempts for extubation which failed, eventually requiring tracheostomy (performed at the OSH).
He had persistent pleural effusion  left more then right, requiring tube thoracostomy, pleurocentesis, thoracic surgery consult.
As patient condition improved, although he still has small bilateral pleural effusions, they are stable and do not require other interventions.
His lungs show evidence of bilateral atelectasis, mild bibasilar collapse, evidence of edema.
Had a few bouts of ventilator associated and aspiration pneumonia with proteus, klebsiella, Xanthomonas, yeast which are now controlled (please see ID section), had a number of bronchoscopy for evaluation and diagnosis.
On [**7-14**], Mr [**Known lastname **] was noted to have an rising WBC to 16.8, continued low-grade fevers, rigors, and tachycardic into 140s in atrial fibrillation with systolic BP dropping as low as 70.
Mr [**Known lastname **] was taking into the OR for peritonitis, question of leaking cholecystostomy tube.
On [**7-15**], given his rising Tbili to 4.9, an ERCP was performed and a biliary stent was successfully placed in the common bile duct.
follow up ERCP and EGD showed satisfactory position of the biliary drain [**2207-9-14**] patient again developed increase of the G-tube output with feculent looking material, evidence of aspiration with succus from the ET tube suctioned,respiratory distress, septic physiology.
[**10-9**] - patient developed increased G tube output, he underwent g-tube study which showed well formed tract between colon and stomach(former area of pancreatic cyst, now almost completely obliterated) and g-tube advance too far into the colon.
the tube was pulled back which mildly decrease its output.
Now: patient's abdomen is soft, non-tender, j tube in place, tolerating tube feeds, G-tube in place output [**Telephone/Fax (1) 34966**] cc/day intermittently guac positive, no drainage around the tube.
Bowel sounds present, normal BM on bowel regiment  Liver: patient's liver showed evidence of steatosis for which hepatology and biliary surgery service consult and biopsy was obtained.
The conclusions of the team were that it was due partially due to supplemental nutrition, partially due to patient's severe medical problems.
his liver enzymes normalized, patient is stable and does not require further interventions  Renal/Urology: through out patient admission, patient renal function remained stable, Patient required multiple doses of Lasix and Diamox to help with perioperative diuresis and heart failure.
He had problems with phimosis requiring urology consult for Foley placement.
He developed hypothyroidism for which he has been on Levoxyl.
No active concerns or issues  Hematology: patient has anemia of chronic disease, as well as procedure associated anemia, requiring multiple blood transfusions.
No evidence of coagulopathy  ID: Patient had a few episodes of septic etiology, associated with pneumonia as well as an episode of cholecystostomy tube dislodgement.
through out his admission he developed vent associated pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia (grew klebsiella, proteus, Xanthomonas, yeast).
Infectious disease service followed patient for some time Now: G and J tubes are clean, with no evidence of erythema or cellulitis, his he has some secretions requiring ET suctioning, the most recent culture ([**10-12**]) is growing Xanthomonas.
His nutritional profile showed signs of malnutrition with albumin in 2.4-2.6 range.
He also had multiple electrolyte abnormalities including hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hyperchloremia which normalized with switching to Respalor.
His electrolytes are in good control  Activity: patient has been actively working with physical and occupational therapy services, with slow but steady improvement.
