No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %) with global hypokinesis.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

He underwent cardiac catheterization which showed CTO of LCX and no other acute lesions.
He had complication post-procedure for hypotension and he was transferred to the CCU.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE /NSTEMI: The patient had a prior CABG, an MI in [**2187**] and a PCI 6 months ago at OSH.
He also has advanced COPD and he has had several CHF episodes in the recent past.
The patient had CTO of LCX but otherwise no obstructive disease was noted on his cardiac catheterization.
He initially had no elevation in his CK level and a mild increase in his troponin which was attributed to his worsening renal function.
He had some T-wave changes suggesting ischemia and a possible NSTEMI on EKG.
Follow-up EKG later in the evening after admission showed left axis deviation, evidence of old inferior wall myocardial infarction with q-waves and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
He also had marked intraventricular conduction delay and continuing  ST-T wave changes which were non-specific and difficult to interpret amongst his LBBB.
For NSTEMI management, hHe was continued on his  ASA 325 mg daily,  Plavix 75 mg, Atorvastatin 80mg daily and a heparin drip was started.
He continued to have intermittent mild to moderate chest pains during his hospital stay which were relieved with low doses of IV Morphine.
Beta blockers were held given the concern for cardiogenic shock and his extremely low EF.
CHF: The patient had decompensated heart failure with elevated PCWP and low CI.
An arterial line was placed for better monitoring of his hemodynamics and his non-invasive BP was noted to be approximately 10mmHg less then arterial measurement.
He was given some gentle diuresis as tolerated by SBP and his Spironolactone was held due to his low BPs.
ECHO done (TTE) on [**2199-9-21**] showed a dilated LA and LV and severely depressed LV function (LVEF= 15 %) with global hypokinesis.
The inferior and infero-lateral walls were notably thinned and akinetic and there was global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis as well.
AORTIC STENOSIS: On physical exam the patient had a prominent mid-systolic ejection murmur best heard at the right second intercostal space, with radiation into the right neck.
TTE also noted severe aortic stenosis.
The patient's valvular disease further contributed to Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 75103**] poor cardiac output and worsening heart failure.
RHYTHM: The patient was in normal sinus rhythm initially but began to have multiple episodes of short NSVT, PACs and progressive tachycardia into the 160s.
He had started on Amiodarone at an OSH just prior to admission but this was held in the setting of his severe hypotension.
RENAL FAILURE : The patient's renal dysfunction and climbing creatinine were felt to be secondary to his poor forward flow and faltering cardiac index in the setting of his advanced heart failure and overnight NSTEMI.
PULMONARY EDEMA/ RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 75012**] was hypoxic from accumulating pulmonary edema from his worsening CHF.
He remained difficult to wean off of oxygen and diuresis was limited because of extreme renal failure and inability to dose large amounts of lasix in the setting of his extreme hypotension with SBPs in the 70s.
Moreover, the patient had underlying risk factors for interstitial lung disease and COPD history per records which also negatively impacted his pulmonary reserve.
He had a poor appetite during his stay and was unable to take in oral food over the last day of his CCU stay prior to his death as he was in fulminant CHF with respiratory distress.
ADDITIONAL CARE / PROPHYLAXIS: -In terms of wound care, the patient was given a Duoderm for additional care of his buttock ulcer during his hospital course.
The EP team was called to deactivate the patient's pacemaker and he was given IV Morphine for comfort and IV Lasix drip for additional relief of his gross fluid overloaded state and pulmonary edema.
He became hypotensive and bradycardic and went into respiratory arrest.
