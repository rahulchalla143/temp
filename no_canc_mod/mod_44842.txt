INDICATION: 72-year-old female with left subdural hematoma status post evacuation.
There is a similar-sized large left frontal subdural hematoma with complex attenuation which overall is of similar appearance compared to two days prior.
The widest width of this hematoma as measured in similar location to prior study in the left frontal region is 18 mm, previously 19 mm.
There is a similar amount of pneumocephalus, again demonstrated is a 6 mm of rightward shift of the midline with subfalcine herniation.
There is no hydrocephalus and mild mass effect is being exerted upon the left lateral ventricle frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
Moderate opacification of the left mastoid air cells and opacity within the sphenoid sinus is again noted.
IMPRESSION:  Complex density left subdural hematoma status post evacuation and drain removal of similar size and appearance.
No evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report  BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT  [**2127-1-8**] 11:20 AM  BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT  Reason: Please evaluate for DVT  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 72 year old woman with h/o of DVT now with SDH s/p evacuation x 3.
Recent Duplex was negative for DVT but off coumadin and we want to monitor for recurrence of thrombus.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: Please evaluate for DVT CLINICAL HISTORY: 72-year-old female with history of DVT with subdural hematoma, status post evacuation x3.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed.
No intraluminal thrombus is identified.
IMPRESSION: No bilateral lower extremity DVT.
[**Hospital3 **] emergently sent pt to the ED for evaluation of new onset of apraxia and confusion.
Pt was found to have hyponatremia on initial evaluation, admitted to the medicine team with full medical work up obtained.
Her operative procedure was uneventful and she had a subdural drian placed.
Pt initially had improved mental status with increased alertness and slightly improved speech.
On [**1-15**] the family requested a neurology consult due to patient's declining mental status.
Neurology recommended an EEG which showed no epileptiform.
A repeat head CT showed the SDH with slight reaccumulation.
Post operatively pt has been continually progressing with improved speech, increased alertness and increased awareness.
