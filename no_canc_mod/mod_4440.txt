(enlarged from [**2159-7-31**]), and small ascites (relatively unchanged).

The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Spontaneous echo contrast is noted in the left heart consistent with slow flow.
There is moderate to severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

RLE U/S [**2159-9-6**]: no DVT .

1 CHF: Severe systolic CHF with EF <20% with moderate MR, hypotension likely secondary to poor cardiac output.
He was held on most of his heart failure meds given BP parameter setting (SBP<95), but we adjusted the parameter to hold meds for SBP<85, and the decision was made not to take him for right heart cath at the time since he was able to tolerate his heart failure meds with changing parameters.
4 Abdominal Pain.
Leading diagnosis is congestion from CHF causing pain from liver capsule expansion.
He continued to complained abdominal pain while in the hopsital, and seemed to improved with pain management.
We followed his daily LFTs, which continued to be mildly elevated but stable c/w with liver congestion from his heart failure.
RUE VTE developed at home, not in setting of line placement.
Patient now developed a small PE while supratherapeutic on coumadin.
Concerning for hypercoagulable state.
Given Echo showed questionable LV thrombus and given ?
He also finished a 7 day course for Kefelx for superifical thrombophlebitis.
6 R renal infarct.
Noted on CT torso, new finding which was concerning for thromboembolic disease, possibly LV thrombus give dilated CMP predisposing to intracardiac stasis.
Echo aslo suggestive of poor flow.
No clots seen on echo however.
No evidence of endocarditis given no fevers, bl cx negative to date from ED.
Baseline 1.0, initially slightly elevated secondary to poor cardiac output +/- renal infarct.
We held lasix and [**Last Name (un) **] initially given slightly elevated BUN/Cr; once Cr back to his baseline, [**Last Name (un) **] and lasix was restarted.
8 Pain syndrome.
Multifactorial, mainly around his ICD site (no signs of infection and remained afebrile thorughout the hospital course) and abdomen (most likely related to congestive hepatopathy).
Chronic pain service was consulted, which recommended oxycodone 5-15mg PO q4h prn, tradmadol 50mg PO q4-6h prn, and gabapentin 600mg PO tid, and lidocaine 5% patch 12 hours on and 12 hours off.
Patient's pain slightly improved on this regimen.
9 Congestive hepatopathy.
LFTs mildly elevated initally, we followed closely his daily LFTs, which remained slightly elevated but stable.
11 PPx: INR elevated initially, once therapeutic, started coumadin (and lovenox and INR<2.0), bowel reg prn, po diet, PPI  .
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: Three (3) Tablet PO every six (6) hours as needed: hold for oversedation and RR<12.
Disp:*180 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis: Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy chronic pain .
Secondary diagnosis: NSVT s/p AICD placement [**8-2**].
RUE DVT/small subsegmental PE - on coumadin as outpatient Chronic pain - [**3-1**] AICD placement, DVT, superficial thrombophlebitis, abdominal pain   Discharge Condition: Patient is in stable condition, afebrile, no chest pain, shortness of breath, Blood pressure stable, ambulating, O2 sat in the upper 90%.
Discharge Instructions: If you experience any chest pain, SOB, heart palpitations, fever, abdominal pain different than your baseline or any other serious medical conditions, please go to the emergency room immediately.
You have chronic pains, and we consulted chronic pain management team, they recommended you taking oxycodone 5-15mg PO every [**5-3**] hours as needed for pain control, tramodal 50mg PO every [**5-3**] hours as needed for pain control, lidocaine 5% patch 12 hours on and 12 hours off, and gabapentin 600mg by mouth three times a day for pain control.
If you experience pain different than your baseline, please seek medical attention immediately.
