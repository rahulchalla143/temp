Admission Date:  [**2166-5-30**]       Discharge Date:  [**2166-6-6**]  Date of Birth:   [**2117-1-14**]       Sex:  M  Service:  [**Location (un) 259**] [**Hospital1 **]  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 49-year-old gentleman with hepatitis B, alcohol-induced cirrhosis with multiple admissions for melanotic stools and upper GI bleed, who is most recently admitted to [**Hospital1 188**] from [**12-19**] to [**12-23**], and is here now presenting with hypertension, anemia, and hematemesis.
The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit on [**2166-5-30**] after experiencing an episode of hematemesis and becoming faint.
The patient initially had been admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] in late [**Month (only) 404**] for melenic stools and at that time the patient was hemodynamically stable, therefore TIPS was deferred.
He did note some weakness and fatigue and mild abdominal pain.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
History of hematemesis, melenic stools in [**2166-7-28**].
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
Generally, the patient is well-nourished, mildly jaundiced, protuberant abdomen in no acute distress.
HEENT:  No lymphadenopathy, anicteric sclerae.
Neck: No jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy.
Pulmonary:  Faint bibasilar crackles, no wheezes, and otherwise clear.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema, no palmar erythema, no spider telangiectasia.
An ultrasound was performed on the [**8-3**], and was read as having a patent TIPS with no ascites.
A CT scan of the abdomen was performed at that time to assess for any fluid collection near the site of the TIPS, perhaps an abscess, or a hematoma.
The CT scan impression read no abscess, small amount of ascites with pericholecystic fluid.
There was a perfusion defect noted in the right hepatic lobe consistent with an infarction.
The patient continued to spike temperatures throughout the remainder of his hospital course receiving Tylenol prn and blood and urine cultures were sent with each spiking temperature with no growth to date upon discharge.
Interventional Radiology as well as the Liver Service discussed the possibility of revising the TIPS in the setting of fevers and elevated liver function tests.
I was thought that the patient's fevers were attributed to this focal area of ischemia within the liver and that by following the liver function tests, we would be able to monitor this.
The patient's overall clinical presentation had not changed dramatically, however, he was complaining of referred shoulder pain as well as hiccups during the last two days of hospitalization.
The patient was treated with Thorazine prn for hiccups, and received one time doses of oxycodone for the shoulder pain.
The patient remained febrile throughout the remainder of his hospital course, however, there was no obvious source of infection based on CT scan of the abdomen, ultrasound, and chest x-ray performed on the [**8-3**].
The patient currently does not have a regimen that he takes at home, and was instructed to followup with his PCP for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] diabetic treatment.
After his hematocrit had gone up from 28 to 30, we decided that the patient was stable for discharge.
Thorazine 10-25 mg po tid as needed for hiccups.
