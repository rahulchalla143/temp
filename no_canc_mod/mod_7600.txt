The patient is status post cardiac catheterization on [**2192-3-5**], for exertional angina and chest tightness with radiation to his jaw and arms.
He had a previous exercise stress test in [**2191-11-16**] in an outside system that showed possibly inferior ischemia.
The patient self-discontinued his nitro-paste two days prior to admission because of a headache.
The patient subsequently developed sustained substernal chest pain all day prior to admission and presented to [**Hospital3 **].
The patient also had back pain at the time and states that sometimes his back pain can trigger the chest pain.
He had some mild nausea and diaphoresis, some mild lightheadedness, and radiation to the jaw.
Electrocardiogram there showed a paced rhythm.
The patient continued to have chest pain intermittently, initially [**8-24**] to [**9-24**] and improving to [**2-25**] to [**3-24**] with nitroglycerin.
Back pain with lumbosacral spondylosis.
Chronic right knee arthritis for which he tapes Ultram.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy, status post transurethral resection of prostate.
Coronary artery disease with chronic bradycardia.
He had a DDD pacemaker placed for advanced AV block in [**2191-10-16**] when he presented with fatigue and bradycardia.
He has peptic ulcer disease with no history of gastrointestinal bleeding.
ALLERGIES:  He has an allergy to CODEINE.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination he was alert, awake, and in no acute distress.
His carotids were 2+ with no bruits.
He had no significant jugular venous distention.

His abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.
Extremities showed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Right groin previous catheterization site had no bruits or hematoma.
LABORATORY/RADIOLOGY:  Electrocardiogram on admission showed a rate of 60 with atrial ventricular pacing.
There appeared to be approximately one QRS of slightly different morphology, suggesting the possibility of failed pacer capture.
Chest x-ray showed no congestive heart failure, no effusions, and no consolidations.
He did rule in for a myocardial infarction with small MB leak.
The patient recovered well and was up and walking with no subsequent chest pain or other symptoms.
The electrophysiology service was also consulted to examine the patient's pacemaker given the possible report of failed pacer capture, and the patient was found to be in good condition with good capture and no other problems.
