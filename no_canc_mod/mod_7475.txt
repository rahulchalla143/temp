mild LV systolic dysfunction with basal infero-lateral thinning and akinesis.
mildly thickened AV.
MV mildly thickened.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-2-24**], no definite change (prior study was of poor quality to exclude above findings).

TTE [**6-22**]: Severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction - EF = 20-25%.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-5-2**], LV systolic function has markedly deteriorated and severity of MR has increased.
inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis was present on the prior study.
CXR [**2169-6-23**]: More extensive left lower lobe opacity, probably due to atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Bilateral effusions and persistent right lower lobe process, suggesting edema versus infection.
Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 33905**] is a 72 yo M with history of CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD who presented with VT/ PEA/ cardiac arrest with prolonged resuscitation (CPR > 45min), intubated for airway protection, whose course was complicated by anoxic brain injury.
The etiology of original arrhythmia was most likely scar-induced.
Follow-up echo on [**2169-6-22**] showed EF of 20-25% with severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which had markedly deteriorated.
3) CAD w/3 vessel disease:The patient was maintained on ASA and statin given his history of CAD.
Subsequent CXR findings (Above) showed evidence of a LLL infiltrate and + sputum stain of GPC on [**6-22**], and the patient was empirically treated for a PNA with vancomycin/levofloxacin/flagyl.
He was placed on 24 hour EEG monitoring, and neurology determined him to be in status epilepticus secondary to anoxic brain injury.
After hospital day 3 there were no observed recurrences of this seizure-like activity.
?s overall prognosis was grim for a meaningful neurological recovery.
5) DM was controlled with an ISS.
6) FEN: On hospital day 2 tube feeds were started without complication.
7) Prophylaxis: The patient received heparin gtt initially for suspected PE, and was maintained on heparin drip for atrial fibrillation.
Pt also received a PPI, and bowel meds prn for prophylaxis.
