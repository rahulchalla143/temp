There are degenerative changes, most marked at C4-5 with canal narrowing and probable encroachment on the spinal cord, although this is poorly evaluated due to motion.
However, there is a small amount of tissue edema or fluid anterior to the C3 through C5 vertebral bodies.
This may represent hemorrhage, perhaps suggesting a ligamentous compromise.
Worsening right basilar lung opacity with adjacent increasing right pleural effusion.
Multiple rib fractures are noted bilaterally.
Known spinal fractures are better demonstrated on recent CT torso of [**2155-4-12**].
Healed right clavicular fracture incidentally noted.
Posterior right rib fractures of the seventh through twelfth rib, and fourth through seventh rib on the right anteriorly.
Comminuted left scapular fracture without extension to the glenohumeral joint.
Left transverse process fractures at T6 through T11 and L1 through L4.
T9, L1 and L4 vertebral body fractures without retropulsion.
Bilateral inferior pubic ramus fractures and bilateral superior ramus fractures.
Multiple small foci of intrapleural air on the right consistent with tiny pneumothoraces.
Several small foci adjacent to rib fractures low in the abdomen likely located in the soft tissues, rather than the peritoneal space.
Posterior opacities in the lower lobes bilaterally and upper lobes are present and may represent atelectasis and/or consolidation, with early contusion a possibility.
Mild stranding of the mediastinal fat with multiple small lymph nodes, significance of which is uncertain, however, the aorta and great vessels appear intact.
