FINDINGS: Well-defined hypodensity is noted of the parasagittal right frontal cortex and subcortical white matter consistent with acute infarction.
A smaller area of hypodensity of the left parietal cortex and subcortical white matter is also consistent with acute infarction.
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
No osseous or surrounding soft tissue abnormality is seen.
IMPRESSION: Acute infarction of the right frontal and left parietal lobes.

No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Severely depressed LVEF.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity.
Focal apical hypokinesis of RV free wall.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2.There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesia of the apex , inferolateral, inferior and inferior septum.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
4.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
LV systolic function is slightly improved.
There is trivial mitral regurgitation.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-26**], there is no longer any convincing evidence of pneumothorax.
There is still evidence of pleural effusions, more marked on the left with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure in this patient who has undergone a previous CABG procedure.
He weaned off vasoactive drips, and remained stable from a hemodynamic standpoint.
The CT revealed a right frontal and left parietal stroke.
Once he was fully awake & alert, speech therapy re-evaluated him, and he was able to take po liquids, and ground or soft solid foods.
A limited carotid u/s showed 80-99% stenosis so a vascular consult was obtained.
Bicarb for CTA NaHCO3 150 mEq/L D5W at 3.5 ml/kg/hr beginning 1 hour before the imaging study, then NaHCO3 150 mEq/L D5W at 1.2 ml/kg/hr during the imaging study and for 6 hours after study   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: tba  Discharge Diagnosis: MR/CAD s/p MV Repair, CABG PMHx: afib, MI, CHF s/p CABG, PVD, R CEAx2, BLE angioplasty, lung nodule, CRI   Discharge Condition: Good  Discharge Instructions: Call with fever, redness or drainage from incision or weight gain more than 2 pounds in one day or five in one week.
