Admission Date:  [**2159-11-15**]              Discharge Date:   [**2159-11-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2121-5-14**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Penicillins / Gadolinium-Containing Agents  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1928**] Chief Complaint: Shoulder/back/neck pain and SOB  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: bronchoscopy [**11-16**] Endotracheal intubation Femoral central line placement   History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 38 yo female with pmh of lung cancer, cervical cancer, and thyroid cancer (all unknown types) reported to be in remission who presented to [**Hospital3 8834**] the morning of admission with neck and left lateral pain radiating toward the shoulder, with additional complaint of cough and fever.
At the OSH she underwent a CT which showed new LLL consolidation vs. mass.
For concern for epidural abscess, she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further work-up and evaluation.
She was also sent for a thoracic spine MRI, and developed an anaphylaxis reaction to receiving gadolinium, for which she received 0.3mg epinephrine, 125mg solumedrol, and was placed on non-rebreather for dropping o2 sats.
Past Medical History: Lung Cancer, Primary Depression Irritable Bowel Syndrome  Social History: Current smoker 3cig/day.
Evolution of new areas of mixed ground-glass and consolidative opacities bilaterally, which given their focality and the acuity of development are suggestive of bilateral infectious progression.
Redemonstration and evolution of pleural effusions and tiny pericardial effusion.
[**2159-11-17**]   Radiology CHEST (PA & LAT) IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-16**] and 3: The frontal chest radiographs over the past 36 hours have suggested the development of a generalized interstitial pulmonary abnormality, but today's lateral view shows that the lower lobes are largely spared, and that the process has a great deal of coalescence in the right middle lobe.
It also shows that the mass-like consolidation first seen on the chest CT, [**11-15**] be shrinking.
Overall findings suggest multifocal infection, partially treated, but perhaps due to more than one pathogen.
The interstitial abnormality is very mild, could be a pulmonary drug reaction and is unlikely to be garden variety pulmonary edema in the absence of mediastinal vascular engorgement, progressive cardiac enlargement or pleural effusions.
No pulmonary embolism.
No aortic dissection.
Anteromedial left lower lobe opacity concerning for pulmonary mass, although consolidation is possible.
Post-surgical changes and likely post radiation treatment changes of the right upper lung.
Right upper lobe pleural fluid and thickening.
Please correlate with medical and surgical history and prior chest CTs.
Right upper lobe focal opacity that may represent post-treatment change vs infection.
Small pericardial effusion/thickening.
Brief Hospital Course: Pneumococcal PNA: Met SIRS criteria at admission given fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, plus presumption of infection based on CT scan abnormality.
She was intubated for respiratory distress in the context of anaphylactic reaction to gadolinium while in the ER and admitted to the unit.
CXR [**11-17**] showed worsening b/l infiltrates.
CT chest [**11-18**] revealed evolution of pleural effisions and tiny pericardial effusion and b/l mixed ground-glass opacities.
She was discharged on levofloxacin (to complete a 2 week course) as her OSH reports were significant for pan senstive pneumococcus.
Pulmonology was consulted and felt that her consolidations found on repeat CT imaging were likely due to anaphylactic response to Gad rather than worsening PNA d/t lack of symtpoms.
Given her history of lung adenocarcinoma, she will need follow up chest imaging in [**5-21**] weeks to ensure resolution of her pneumonia.
Anemia: She was found to have anemia (Hct of 35.8) on admission with an unknown baseline.
No clinical evidence of bleeding.
Respiratory Failure: Intubated largely secondary to bronchospasm and anaphylaxis d/t gadolinium used for MRI.
Airway pressures suggested no significant airway resistance, implying that steroids and epinephrine helped reduce the bronchospasm.
A repeat Chest CT on [**11-18**] revealed worsening of consolidations, but per the preliminary pulmonary consult, these findings were felt to be secondary to her anaphylaxis to gadolinium rather than worsening of her pneumonia.
Community acquired pneumonia 3.
Anaphylaxis  Secondary Diagnoses: 1.
Leukocytosis   Discharge Condition: Stable   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a severe pneumonia that required a stay in the intensive care unit.
Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you develop worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, cough with bloody sputum, fever greater than 101, dizziness or lightheadedness, or any new symptoms that you are concerned about.
