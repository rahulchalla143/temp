However, she became notably unresponsive while waiting for her breakfast.
Head CT was negative for ICH, CTA was negative for PE but revealed large right pleural effusion.

EKG ([**2102-6-13**]): paced rhythm at 70, no acute ST-T changes .
No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Moderate-to-large in size right pleural effusion and small left pleural effusion.
Scattered areas of linear atelectasis involving the right and left lower lobes and the right middle [**Month/Day/Year 3630**].
Enlarged heterogeneous appearance of the thyroid, most compatible with multinodular goiter.
Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes of uncertain etiology, could be reactive in nature.
Borderline enlarged main pulmonary trunk measuring 3.3 cm, compatible with pulmonary hypertension.
CT head ([**2102-6-13**]): No evidence of hemorrhage.
Extensive encephalomalacic changes.
However, given the lack of prior studies and the appearance of white matter changes in the right frontal [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] acute component of abnormality cannot be exlcuded.
In addition, identification of any small areas of acute infarction is difficult given the extensive white matter changes.
[**2102-6-21**] Right thoracentesis: 3+ PMNs, no micro organisms seens, cytology and cultures pending  Brief Hospital Course: [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of Afib, CAD s/p MI and PVD who presents with altered mental status.
Altered mental status: The patient intially presented with altered mental status of unknown etiology with a Ddx of acute CVA or intracranial hemorrhage, infection, post-ictal state, opioid toxicity, hypercarbia, or pulmonary embolism.
A CT of the head revealed old infarcts, however, new infarcts could not be excluded.
Neurology consulted on the patient and suggested a MRI given difficulty in recognizing acute infarct on CT, however, patient cannot get an MRI due to her pacemaker.
A U/A revealed a UTI and a urine culture revealed pan-sensitive Klebsiella.
Acute diastolic heart failure/pleural effusion: The patient had a TTE showing LVEF=65=70% with no LVH.
While in the the ICU, the patient developed an acute episode of respiratory distress and her BNP was elevated ~16,000 (on admission~3000).
The patient has a right>left pleural effusion, likely secondary to her diastolic heart failure.
Because of continued hypoxia and episodes of desaturation during this admission, patient underwent IR guided thoracentesis during which 1.2 L of serosanguinous fluid was removed from the right pleural space.
#Hypoxia: Pt's hypoxia attributed to her chronic pleural effusion and underlying pulmonary hypertension.
A CT of the chest revealed atelectasis of the RLL which can be contributing to her hypoxia.
Because of continued episodes of desaturation, patient underwent thoracentesis of the right pleural effusion with improvement of oxygenation status, able to oxygenate well just on supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula.
# UTI: Pt with grossly positive UA and mental status changes, so she was empirically started on Ceftriaxone.
Cultures revealed pan-sensitive Klebsiella and pt completed 10 day course of ciprofloxacin with no growth seen on subsequent urine cultures.
# AFib: Pt with history of afib though currently paced.
# Chronic renal failure: The patient has a baseline Cr of 1.4.
# Pulmonary hypertension: An TTE on this admission revealed pulmonary hyptertension and poor RV failure.
A previous Echo from an admission at [**Hospital1 2025**] in [**12-26**] showed the absence of pulmonary hypertension.
Currently, her pulmonary hyptension is attributed to chronic hypoxia [**12-19**] her pleural effusion on the right side.
Other etiologies such as idiopathic or infectious are less likely.
CTA to evaluate for PE did not demonstrate any large AVMs or intrapulmonary shunts.
However, an enlarged pulmonary arterial trunk without sign of aneurysm was noted and can be a cause of pulmonary hypertension.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for Constipation.
White Petrolatum-Mineral Oil 42.5-56.8 % Ointment Sig: One (1) Appl Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eye.

Fleet Enema 19-7 gram/118 mL Enema Sig: One (1) enema Rectal PRN as needed for constipation.
Once patient is therapeutic, INR can be checked once a week 15. oxygen Patient has a new oxygen requirement.
Albuterol Sulfate 2.5 mg /3 mL (0.083 %) Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) nebulizer Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1) nebulizer Inhalation every 4-6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 2670**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: 1. urinary tract infection 2.
Pleural effusion 3.
Hypoxia 4.
Diastolic CHF, Atrial Fibrillation, coronary artery disease, stroke   Discharge Condition: Stable, afebrile, O2 sat 86-92% on 6 L nasal cannula   Discharge Instructions: You were sent from your nursing home because you became unresponsive.
When you came to the [**Hospital1 18**], imaging was done of your head and chest which showed you did not have a head bleed or pulmonary embolism.
You also had difficulty breathing due to fluid around your right lung most likely from your heart failure.
We gave you medication to remove the extra fluid and the pleural effusion was drained with a needle with improvement in your breathing.
Patient has a new oxygen requirement.
She sometimes transiently desaturates because of positional changes and during sleep, please try repositioning her and waking her up and having her draw large breaths.
