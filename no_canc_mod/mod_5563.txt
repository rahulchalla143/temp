History of Present Illness: Pt is a 41 yo male w/ PMhx sig for DM II, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**8-17**] for worst HA of his life with negative work-up now presents with bilateral subdural hematomas.
The patient has been taking ibuprofen every 4 hrs for the last 3-4 days prior to admission for chronic neck pain.
He was found to be confused and brought to an OSH where head CT showed chronic bilateral subdural hematomas.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitive care.
Past Medical History: DMII HTN Hypercholesterolemia Chronic low back pain Eczema  Social History: -Tob: none -EtOH: Occasional -Illicits: None -Living situation: monogamous with wife, lives with her and 4, 13 and 15 year-olds -Occupation: maitr'd restaurant   Family History: Non Contributory  Physical Exam: On Admission: Vitals: T 99.2; BP 140/91; P 67; RR 14; O2 sat 97% RA  General: lying in bed NAD Neck: supple Pulmonary: CTA b/l Cardiac: regular rate and rhythm, with no m/r/g Abdomen: soft, nontender, non distended, normal bowel sounds Extremities: no c/c/e.
Fluent speech with no paraphasic or phonemic errors.
Able to name low and high frequency objects.
FINDINGS: HEAD CT: There are moderate-sized bilateral subdural hematomas, mildly hyperdense suggesting a subacute nature.
The maximum thickness measures 13mm on the left and 16mm on the right.
There is a 4-mm leftward shift of midline structures .
There is effacement of quadrigeminal and suprasellar cistern, consistent with descending transtentorial herniation.
There is no evidence of tonsillar herniation.
HEAD AND NECK CTA: The carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are patent without evidence of stenosis.
The diamter of distal cervical internal carotid artery measures 4 mm on the right and 4 mm on the left.
There is no evidence of aneurysm formation or other vascular abnormality.
Moderate-sized subacute bilateral subdural hematoma, with 4-mm leftward shift of midline structures.
Evidence of descending transtentorial herniation.
No evidence of tonsillar herniation.
No evidence of aneurysm or stenosis.
CT Head 12/4(7:16am) FINDINGS: There are bilateral subdural hematomas, the left measuring 10 mm compared to 13 mm in prior, and the right measuring 18 mm compared to 16 mm on the prior.
There is persistent effacement of the basal cisterns, consistent with descending transtentorial herniation.
There is no evidence of tonsillar herniation.
There is no evidence of fracture.
CONCLUSION: Unchanged moderate bilateral subdural hematomas.
Mass effect on leftward shift and transtentorial herniation and effacement of basal cisterns.
The subdural collections now consist of nondependent air with predominantly hypodense fluid layering posteriorly with more hyperdense fluid in the most dependent portions of the subdural cavity.
The greatest axial dimension of the subdural fluid on the right approaches 11 mm and on the left, 13 mm.
Effacement of the basilar cisterns persists, suggesting persistent descending transtentorial herniation.
Once again, there is no evidence for tonsillar herniation.
IMPRESSION: Air and mixed density, bilateral subdural collections status post surgical evacuation with persistent mild leftward shift of normally midline structures.
Effacement of basilar cisterns and transtentorial (central) herniation persists.
Unchanged bilateral subdural hematomas and unchanged mass effect compared to prior study on [**2133-11-14**].
No evidence of aneurysm or intracranial vascular malformation.
New air-fluid level at the left maxillary sinus.
He was found to be confused and subsequently brought to an outside hospital.
OSH identified bilateral, significantly sized subdural hematomas, and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitve neurosurgical intervention.
An emergent head CT was done, and identified worsening of bilateral SDH.
On [**11-14**] he was transferred to the ICU due to lethargy and intubated.
He was then started on Mannitol and his mental status resolved.
He had a CTA which was negative for malformation.
Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, or excessive bending.
If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures, you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain medicine can cause constipation.
New onset of tremors or seizures.
Any confusion or change in mental status.
Any numbness, tingling, weakness in your extremities.
Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not relieved by pain medication.
Any signs of infection at the wound site: redness, swelling, tenderness, or drainage.
