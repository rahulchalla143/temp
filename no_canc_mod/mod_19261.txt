RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Severe symmetric LVH.
No resting or inducible LVOT gradient.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
Minimally increased gradient c/w minimal AS.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Mnimally increased gradient consistent with trivial MS.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal views.
Based on [**2138**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with relative sparing of the inferior and inferolateral walls and normal cavity size..
There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is prominent mitral annular calcification leading to minimal functional mitral stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**12-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Hypertrophic non-obstructive cardiomyopathy with preserved regional systolic function.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Minimal aortic stenosis and minimal mitral stenosis.
Other coronary anatomy includes R dominant system only otherwise significant for diffusely diseased OM.
Echo from OSH reveals severe septal hypertrophy, mitral stenosis (peak 10, mean 5) mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], EF > 75%, RVH, Peak LVOT gradient 14mmHg, mean 9, no evidence [**Male First Name (un) **].
C) Rhythm: The patient continued to have brief episodes of atrial fibrillation while on telemetry.
He was also without major risk factors for sudden death, and was determined not to be a candidate for ICD placement.
* GI: The patient was noted to have had a decrease in Hct several days post cath.
His stool was brown (not melanic or BRBPR), but was guaiac positive.
An NGT lavage was clear with no blood or bile.
Neuro exam only notable for L facial droop.
No active issues during this hospitalization.
* COPD: No symptoms during this admission.
You should also have your liver enzymes, thyroid function tests and pulmonary function tests monitored over time.
Finally, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16004**] should also schedule you to have another colonoscopy given you were noted to have blood in your stool during your hospital stay.
