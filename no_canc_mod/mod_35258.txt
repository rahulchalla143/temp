She reports that she has had gastric reflux for approximately five years associated with intermittent abdominal pain which has typically been relieved with maalox.
She reports that for the past week she has been experiencing lightheadedness and weakness with epigastric pain.
The epigastric pain is similar to that which she has experienced in the past which she has attributed to her reflux.
She does not describe the pain as burning.
It was associated with nausea and decreased PO intake but no vomiting.
It was not associated with chest pain or shortness of breath.
She describes having black stools but she has been on iron supplements for the past two months and does not note any change in her stool quality over the past week.
She does not think that she has had low blood counts in the past.
The patient has also recently been suffering from a gout flair for which she was started on colchicine on [**2156-3-20**].
The initiation of colchicine was temporarily related to the start of her lightheadedness and abdominal pain and she originally attributed her symptoms to this medication.
Endoscopy revealed a large clot in the duodenum.
Once the clot was removed a large broad based ulcer was seen with a visible vessel.
She was noted to have increasing abdominal pain and a KUB was ordered which revealed no evidence of free air.
Her abdominal pain resolved after having a bowel movement.
On review of systems she currently denies fevers, chills, lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, hematuria, leg pain or swelling.
Past Medical History: Mechanical mitral valve replacement 22 years ago GERD Ruptured ovarian cyst Hypertension Hyperlipidaemia Gout   Social History: Lives with husband, independent of her activities of daily living, denies tobacco or ethanol use.

[**2156-3-26**] 3:40 pm URINE     Site: CATHETER                              **FINAL REPORT [**2156-3-27**]**     URINE CULTURE (Final [**2156-3-27**]):    NO GROWTH.
There is a tortuous atherosclerotic aorta.
No effusion or pneumothorax is evident.
Small amounts of gas present in nondistended loops of small bowel.
There is no evidence of free intraperitoneal air on the supine radiograph.
Osseous structures with degenerative change of the lumbar spine and appear otherwise within normal limits.
Duodenum: Excavated Lesions A large clot was seen in the duodenal bulb and appeared to be overlying an ulcer.
The clot was then disrupted to reveal a single cratered 1cm ulcer with a central visible vessel.
Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists, as does tortuosity of the aorta.
However, no evidence of vascular congestion, pleural effusion, or acute pneumonia.
Brief Hospital Course: Assesment: Mrs [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old female with a history of a mechanical mitral valve chronically anticoagulated with coumadin who presents with one week of lightheadedness now with known duodenal ulcer s/p endoscopic injection and clipping of visible vessel.
She was found to have a large bleeding duodenal ulcer which was injected with epinephrine and two clips were placed on a visible vessel.
Serial HCTs were stable and there was no obvious rebleeding.
She required no further transfusions.
We are recommending that pt receive outpatient H Pylori breath testing to formally rule out H Pylori infection.
Mechanical Mitral Valve/Anticoagulation:  On presentation the patient's INR was 4.9 likely in the setting of poor PO intake at home.
Of note, she was previously taking 2 Vaseretic (enalapril-HCTZ) tabs daily, with a total dose of HCTZ of 50mg daily, which has been shown to have no benefit above a 25mg daily dose, and has been assosciated with increased morbidity and mortality.
Acute renal failure: On admission the patient's creatinine was 1.7, likely secondary to prerenal azotemia.
Her U/A showed trace leukocyte esterase, and A CXR was without any signs of acute pathology.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Upper Gastrointesinal Bleeding Duodenal Ulcer Hypertension   Discharge Condition: Stable.
You were found to have bleeding from your gastrointestinal tract.
You had an upper endoscopy which revealed an ulcer in your duodenum which was injected and clips were placed to stop the vessel from bleeding.
You had a negative blood test for a bacteria called H Pylori which often causes ulcers such as yours.
Although it was negative, our gastroenterologists would also like you to have an H Pylori breath test to make sure you do not have this bacteria in your stomach.
Please seek immediate medical attention if you experience any fevers > 101 degrees, lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain, difficulty breathing, worsening abdominal pain, black or red stools or any other concerning symptoms.
