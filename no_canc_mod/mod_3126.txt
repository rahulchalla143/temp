SENT TO [**State 15238**] FOR SENSITIVITIES TO FLUCONOZOLE.
Sample sent for microbiology studies.
Large anterior abdominal air and fluid collection with peripheral enhancement status post drainage catheter placement is minimally decreased in AP diameter in the superior portion; however, the inferior portion cannot be compared to prior study as it was not included in the field of imaging.
Small amount of heterogeneous and hyperdense material adjacent to the inferior aspect of the liver may represent small amount of blood clot.
Extensive anasarca and intra-abdominal and pelvic ascites.
No extravasation of contrast outside the tube or the stomach is identified.
Also noted is a pigtail catheter entering from the left side of the abdomen.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal cavity size with mild global left ventricular hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.)
Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
Aortic valve sclerosis.
Free communication of anterior abdominal wall abscess with the stomach via the patient's G-tube tract.
Recommend followup KUB to assess for advancement via peristalsis.
There is no effusion, consolidation or evidence of pulmonary edema.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality  [**2168-2-4**] CT-abd/pelvis IMPRESSION: 1.
Status post debridement of left anterior abdominal air and fluid collection.
Gas and fluid persists in the left abdominal wall but has reduced since prior study, with a small residual fluid-containeng component at the left inguinal region.
Persistent but lessened moderate ascites 3.
Progressed appearance of airspace opacification at bases (right greater than left), compatible with aspiration and/or infection.
Persistent extensive vascular calcifications.
No evidence of intra-abdominal or pelvic abscess.
Ascites and widespread peritoneal, pelvic and omental nodularity, similar to that seen previously.
It is unclear if this is reactive or neoplastic.
If indicated, peritoneal fluid cytology could be considered.
Increasing bibasilar pulmonary consolidations.
Heterogeneous splenic attenuation.
Given the atherosclerosis, this may be related to abnormal perfusion timing.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease.
Diffuse echogenicity of the liver, most likely in keeping with fatty infiltration.
Severely thickened gallbladder wall, secondary to the patient's hypoalbuminemia.
No evidence of filling defects within the biliary tree.
There are low lung volumes.
Mild cardiomegaly is stable.
Right lower lobe atelectasis is more conspicuous from prior.
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
No evidence of chronic or active tuberculosis.
No intrathoracic lymphadenopathy.
Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
Chronic RLL subsegmental atelectasis.
Brief Hospital Course: 48F with h/o Hep B, DM, chronic diarrhea, malnutrition s/p recent PEG placement, who presented with abdominal pain and malaise, found to have an abdominal wall abscess, now s/p ex-lap and extensive debridement.
Her hospital course has been complicated by E.Coli, [**Female First Name (un) 564**], and Pseudomonas bacteremia and increased diarrhea likely secondary to a mycobacterial GI infection.
Abdominal Wall Abscess: The patient initially presented with fatigue and was found to have DKA at an OSH.
Given concern for abdominal fullness on physical exam, she had a CT-abdomen, which showed evidence of an abdominal abscess around the site of her PEG tube, which was placed on [**2168-1-6**].
On [**1-28**], the patient underwent an ex-lap for debridement and limited gastric resection.
Her hospital course has been complicated by extensive abdominal wall debridement requiring I&D by surgery: [**2168-2-15**] I+D abdominal wound, [**2168-2-13**] I+D abdominal wall infection, and [**2168-2-5**] I+D abdominal wall abscess.
The patient's abdominal wound has a wound-vac placed by Plastic Surgery.
Additionally, she will continue TPN in hopes of improving her nutritional status for appropriate wound healing for closure.
She is currently being seen by gastroenterology and has known pancreatic insufficiency on Creon.
TTG IGA is negative for celiac disease, and she was previously found to have low stool elastase and positive fecal fat, concerning for malabsorption.
The patient had a colonoscopy and biopsy from [**3-3**] with no diagnostic abnormalities.
She was initiated on TPN for nutrition with minimal po intake.
She has had multiple stool C. diff and cultures that have returned negative.
A CT chest with contrast was negative for any signs of active or chronic Tb and respiratory isolation precautions were discontinued per ID recommendations [**3-11**].
The state lab is attempting to speciate the type of mycobacterium via DNA probes and may take up to 6 weeks.
The AFB in her stools could be a cause of her chonic diarrhea, but treat is not being pursued until final speciation has been made.
# Chronic hep B infection/autoimmune cholangiopathy.
The patient remains jaundiced on physical exam and her LFTs have been fluctuating likely secondary to a combination of her chronic liver diseases, blood transfusions, and TPN.
RUQ U/S read indicates irregular contour and heterogeneity of the liver suggestive of chronic liver disease with a small amount of ascites.
Her blood cultures also grew Pseudomonas and E.Coli on [**2-24**].
Likely source is her intra-abdominal infection.
The patient should have Ophtho follow-up in 2 weeks given her Candidemia or sooner if she develops vision symptoms.
The patient with persistent leukocytosis during her hospitalization ranging between 15-20K.
The patient was followed by [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes during her hospitalization.
Given the patient's bacteremia and fungemia her previous tunnelled line was removed on [**1-24**].
Her anemia is likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease/inflammation and chronic kidney disease.
# Hypertension.
Her BP medications should be held until after dialysis per renal in order to minimize hypotension in HD.

Secondary diagnoses: -chronic hepatitis B infection -autoimmune cholangiopathy -ESRD on HD M/W/F -HTN -Diabetes -h/o CVA -chronic diarrhea   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to [**Hospital1 **] Hospital for evaluation of fatigue and were found to have diabetic ketoacidosis as a result of an abdominal abscess/infection around the site of your PEG tube.
The fluid inside the abscess was drained and grew out several multi drug resistant bacteria and yeast.
This bacteria also entered your blood stream and required a long course of treatment with several powerful antibiotics and antifungals.
You also needed additional surgeries to clean out the infection and abscess which led to your open abdominal wound requiring a wound vac.
You were also having profuse diarrhea following food intake and were malnourished.
