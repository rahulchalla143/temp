Family denies any recent complaints.
Past Medical History: - Afib on ASA - Stroke in [**2108**] with babbling speech, resolved without deficits - Colon Ca [**2106**] - Hip fracture (l) s/p repair - HOH - "Legally blind"   Social History: Lives with her son, daughter and grandson.
family [**Name2 (NI) 88665**] very remote smoking use, no alcohol.
Extinction and inattention: 1  General: cachetic and ill appearing Head and Neck: no cranial abnormalities,mm dry Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
No nuchal rigidity Pulmonary: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally Cardiac: regular rate and rhythm Abdomen: soft, normoactive bowel sounds Extremities: 2+ radial, DP pulses bilaterally.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Does not repeat or answer questions.
There is no spontantous antigravity movement of the left arm or leg, but both withdraw appropriately to noxious stim.
Imaging: [**2110-5-29**]   UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US: No DVT in the right upper extremity.
Unchanged size of the right frontal lobar parenchymal hemorrhage, degree of associated edema, and mild leftward shift of normally-midline structures.
No evidence of central herniation.
No new intracranial hemorrhage.
Decreased quantity of intraventricular blood, layering in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle and unchanged quantity of blood layering in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle.
No new hydrocephalus.
Mild leftward shift of midline structures.
[**2110-5-27**]   ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
No cardiac source of embolus identified (cannot definitively exclude) other than atrial fibrillation.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
Extensive calcific arteriosclerosis, particularly intracranially, with regions of moderate-to-severe narrowing but no evidence of large vessel occlusion and no aneurysm.
No flow-limiting disease within the neck.
A thin linear filling defect within the left internal carotid artery origin, may represent a focal dissection or complex atheromatous plaque.
[**2110-5-26**]   ECG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Low voltage throughout.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc  P QRS T 126  0  72  328/443 0 -14 65  Brief Hospital Course: [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 88664**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old right handed woman with a history of paroxsysmal atrial fibrillation who presents with sudden onset of left sided weakness this afternoon.
The patient has a very limited functional baseline and so her presenting exam is also difficult.
At admission, the patient has a clear left facial droop, left arm and leg weakness.
CTA is without a clear occlusion (though recons pending) but perfusion studies show a possible increased MTT in the right temporal/parietal region.
Likely source of clot is atrial fibrillation or cardiac atheroemboli.
She was unable to tolerate MRI, so repeat head CT [**5-27**] obtained, which showed hemorrhagic transformation of stroke w. intraventricular bleed, a repeat head CT with less blood in ventricles, no hydrocephalus.
On admission exam demonstrated L sided weakness (upper and lower extremity), L facial droop, dysarthria but fluent speech; facial droop improved.
Cardiovascular: - Held aspirin she should follow up in 8 weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to determine if she can be restarted and possible repeat imaging to examine for stability of the bleed She was started on metoprolol for rate control.
Stroke Risk Factors: - LDL: 93 - HgBA1c: 5.4 - TTE: No cardiac source of embolus identified (cannot definitively exclude) other than atrial fibrillation  Pulmonary: - A CXR demonstrated Ill-defined right upper lobe opacity is not fully characterized but could potentially represent a neoplastic mass.
She also had some left upper extremity swelling and an ultrasound negative for DVT.
Endocrine: - No active issues and HgbA1C was 5.4. .
Infectious Disease: - urine cx c/w w. evidence of contamination on repeat UA there was 55 WBCs and therefore was given a Week supply of Bactrim.
Disp:*14 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*   Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Location (un) 86**] VNA  Discharge Diagnosis: Stroke   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
You had some bleeding in your brain after this.
This stroke was thought to be secondary to your atrial fibrillation.
