Brief Hospital Course: 45 yo woman w/ h/o HCV cirrhosis, right sided HF, recently d/c after treatment of orthostatic hypotension, now a/w  worsening LE edema and cough.
Cor pulmonale:  she has severe right sided heart failure [**3-17**] pulm HTN, which is responsible for her complaints of peripheral edema.
This has been difficult to control given her concurrent cirrhosis w/ low albumin.
Aggressive diuresis depletes intravascular volume and deprives RV of high filling volumes that are needed to maintain cardiac output.
There is no evidence of ACS by EKG and cardiac enzymes.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted for this patient and it was determined that there were no other therapies with would change this patient's poor prognosis.
HCV cirrhosis:  She has cirrhosis from HCV and h/o etoh abuse.
RUQ doppler US shows no evidence of ascites or portal thrombosis.
The patient intermittenly becomes encheplpathic and this usually correlates with her refusal of lactulose.

It was felt to be caused by hepatic encalholpaty.
Given her diagnoses, her mental status will likely deterioate.
