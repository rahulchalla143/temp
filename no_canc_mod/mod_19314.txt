He was also eating sugar-filled foods and drinking regular soda despite being told repeatedly that he needs to follow a diabetic diet.
After his third hospital day, with stabilization and transfer to the floor, the pt felt more in control of his diagnosis, wroked along with the team on his diet and insulin doses and asked many pertinent and appropriate questions.
