There is no intrahepatic bile duct dilatation.
There is no free fluid around the liver.
The gallbladder is normal without evidence of stones   Brief Hospital Course: 25 year old female with history of drug abuse, recent diagnosis of hepatitis B presenting with fulminant liver failure.
Fulminant liver failure: Ms [**Known lastname 30121**] was in acute fulminant liver failure on admission.
There was no report of an overdose however we considered toxicity given her history of substance abuse.
We also considered acute hepatitis as a possibility, particularly since her boyfriend had been recently diagnosed with hepatitis C. Serum and urine toxicity screens at the outside hospital and [**Hospital3 **] were negative.
Hepatitis testin grevealed that she had acute hepatitis C. Liver transplant evaluated her on admission, and said she was not a liver transplant candidate at that time given her history of drug abuse.
She was treated with adefovir for hepatitis C, and with N-acetylcysteine throughout her hospitalization.
Given her increased risk for gram postitive infection, she was treated prophylactically with levofloxacin.
Over the course of her hospitalization her LFTs steadily improved and normalized, but her total bilirubin remained elevated, suggesting that severe liver disfunction rather than improvement in disease.
She was monitored closely for signs of increasing intra-cranial pressure, with frequent neuro exams with pupil and retina checks.
She was also noted to have decerebrate posturing of her upper extremities.
Neuroscurgery and neurology were consulted, but felt there was little else to do given her acute hepatitis C, and suggested continuing mannitol and ativan.
Despite these therapies, she failed to recover, and began to show further signs of increasing intracranial pressure with increasing seizure activity and posturing, and on the eighth hospital day the decision was made to make to make her comfort measures only.
Elevated INR: This was due to her acute hepatitis C. She was treated with Vitamin K PO for 3 days twice.
Her INR was followed every 6-8 hours, and she was given FFP as needed for proceedures or if bleeding, and to keep INR < 4.0. .
Her FiO2 was increased midway through her stay due to desaturation> it was felt that she may have a component of heart failure given that she was 13 liters positive for length of stay.
Ultimately it was felt that her respiratory status was largely due to her encephalopathy.
We started tube feeds per nutrition recommendations, but Ms. [**Known lastname 30121**] had high residuals so her tube feeds were frequently held, and never ran at the goal rate.
She was bolused prn for low urine output, and received free water flushes through her NG tube.She was also treated with a MVI, folate, and thiamine.
PPx: Ms. [**Known lastname 30121**] was not anticoagulated given her elevated INR.
Disp: Ms. [**Known lastname 30121**] died of acute fulminant liver failure secondary to hepatitis C infection on [**2143-9-6**].
