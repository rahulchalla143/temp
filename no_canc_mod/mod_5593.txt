Admission Date:  [**2143-4-17**]     Discharge Date:  [**2143-4-25**] Date of Birth:                  Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 26685**] is a 40 year-old male with a past medical history significant for hematuria only who presents to the Coronary Care Unit as a transfer from the floor for hypertensive urgency.
His history of present illness dates back to [**Month (only) 1096**] when he had an upper respiratory tract infection times several day with nasal congestion and sore throat.
Since resolution of his illness he has had intermittent episodes of pressure in his epigastric region, shortness of breath and cough as well as orthopnea, though he denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and edema.
He states that his symptoms are worse at night and cause difficulty sleeping.
He also reports progressively decreasing exercise tolerance.
An outpatient workup over the last few months has included a chest x-ray, which showed interstitial markings and hilar fullness.
A CT, which showed bronchial wall and septal line thickening, increased pulmonary vasculature, ground glass opacification and bilateral pleural effusions read as consistent with congestive heart failure versus sarcoid.
On the day of admission he presented for an outpatient echocardiogram, however, during the examination when he was in the left decubitus position he developed acute onset of shortness of breath and was noted to have diffuse rales.
He was transferred to the Emergency Department and treated for acute pulmonary edema with intravenous Lasix, nitroglycerin drip and sublingual Captopril.
After treatment he had resolution of his symptoms, but his blood pressure continued to be high and on admission to the floor he had a blood pressure of 190 to 110.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies headache, flushing, diaphoresis, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, urinary complaints, fevers or chills.
He does report a five pound weight loss recently.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hematuria and hemospermia status post negative cystoscopy times three over the past two years.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No smoking.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Parents and siblings without cardiac disease.
Sclera anicteric.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Nondisplaced point of maximal impulse.
No hepatosplenomegaly or masses.
Funduscopic examination no papilledema.
Left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria.
T wave inversion in 1, ST depressions in 2, 3 and AVF, J point elevations in V1 through V3.
Chest x-ray with mild reticular interstitial pattern.
No cardiomegaly, question cephalization, consistent with mild congestive heart failure.
Urinalysis negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 40 year-old male with no prior cardiac history presenting with three to four months of shortness of breath and orthopnea, found to hve severe cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology and hypertensive urgency.
Hypertensive urgency:  The patient with significantly elevated blood pressures on admission.
On examination no funduscopic findings.
His urinalysis was without blood or proteinuria.
He did have a somewhat elevated creatinine of 1.3.
He was continued on his nitroglycerin drip and Captopril was added both for hypertensive control as well as for after load reduction in the setting of his severe cardiomyopathy.
He was also noted to be an extremely anxious man and he was started on Ativan.
He was started on Diltiazem po after weaning of his drips.
A beta blocker was deferred due to his workup for hypertension, which included urine studies for metanephrines and VMA, aldosterone level, renal ultrasound and renal angiography.
His renal ultrasound showed no abnormalities.
Renal angiography, which was performed during his cardiac catheterization (see below) showed 40% renal artery stenosis on the right and 50% renal artery stenosis on the left.
Cardiomyopathy:  Patient with severe cardiomyopathy ejection fraction less then 20% of unclear etiology.
Differential included viral cardiomyopathy given his history of viral illness a few months prior, which was also the same time that his symptoms began.
It was also considered that his persistent resting tachycardia and hypertension over the past few months may have contributed.
A cardiac catheterization was performed to rule out ischemic cardiomyopathy.
His left heart catheterization revealed high diagonal with proximal 90% stenosis, twin left anterior descending coronary artery system, ramus with mild luminal irregularities, right coronary artery with luminal irregularities and 40% lesion in the RPL.
It was not felt that the 90% lesion in his high diagonal was contributing to his cardiomyopathy, however, the decision was to proceed with angioplasty of that lesion with 20% residual stenosis after the procedure.
The patient also had anterobasal, anterolateral, apical inferior and posterobasal hypokinesis.
The patient's cardiomyopathy was managed with Captopril for after load reduction as well as aggressive hypertensive management as above.
Beta blocker was deferred until pheochromocytoma workup completed as above.
Given his severe global hypokinesis including apical hypokinesis he was started on a heparin drip and Coumadin for anticoagulation.
Renal:  Patient with chronic renal insufficiency, presumed due to hypertension and possibly contributed to by poor cardiac output.
As stated above the patient was noted to have noncritical stenoses in his bilateral renal arteries.
His creatinine remained mildly elevated, but stable throughout his hospitalization.
He was also started on standing Ativan as it was felt that his anxiety was contributing to his hypertension.
Hypertensive urgency.
