Admission Date:  [**2175-10-4**]              Discharge Date:   [**2175-10-6**]  Date of Birth:  [**2095-10-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2248**] Chief Complaint: Elective Cardiac Catheterization  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Cardiac Catheterization with deployment of 3 drug eluting stents   History of Present Illness: 79 yo female with hx Sjogren's Syndrome, HTN, HLD with complaints of new onset exertional anginal symptoms with diaphoresis and lightheadedness, found to have abnormal sress test, admitted for cardiac catheterization.
The patient reports she has been experiencing progressively worsening dizziness, nausea, and diaphoresis on exertion over the past year.
About 2-3 months ago, she began experiencing worsening symptoms of lightheadedness, nausea, diaphoresis, and weakness with climbing stairs and when she cooked or did housework for about an hour.
Due to these symptoms, the patient underwent a persantine MIBI at at [**Hospital 3856**] on [**2175-9-26**], which showed a moderate sized septal infarct in addition to anteroseptal and apical ischemia with an LVEF of 68%.
She denies presyncope or syncope.
In the cath lab, the patient was found to have 1 vessel disease with 90% stenosis of the LAD and had three DES placed to the LAD.
She complained of significant back pain between her scapula, and also had nausea and emesis.
Of note, the patient has had unchanged chronic back pain for years, which she describes as pain between her scapula which occurs when she is under significant emotional stress or when she is fatigued.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension Sjogren's syndrome Anxiety Moderate Arthritis Tonsillectomy Chronic Back pain   Social History: Tobacco: Denies.
Family History: Mother died of MI at 65yo, two maternal aunts died of MIs in 60's.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No xanthalesma.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities.
CTAB anteriorly and laterally, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
R groin site with small amount of blood around angioseal closure site.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: No chest wall deformities.
CTAB anteriorly and laterally, no crackles, wheezes or rhonchi.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
dressing C/D/I SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the mid to distal anterior septum and anterior wall.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent with LAD ischemia/infarction.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 79 yo female with hx Sjogren's Syndrome, HTN, HLD presenting with exertional angina and abnormal stress test, admitted following a complicated cardiac catheterization.
# CAD:  The patient denies frank chest pain, and describes her anginal equivalent as diaphoresis, nausea, lightheadedness, and weakness presenting as atypical chest pain.
Persantine MIBI on [**2175-9-26**] at [**Hospital3 1280**] showed moderate sized septal infarct and anteroseptal and apical ischemia.
Cardiac catheterization revealed 1 vessel disease with 90% stenosis of the LAD, complicated by dissection of the LAD during intervention.
Patient is now s/p 3 DES to the LAD and denies symptoms including chest pain, dyspnea, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, nausea.
She had no episodes of chest pain and her EKGs remained unchanged.
She had an echo that showed a depressed EF to 45-50% and evidence of septal wall infarct.
#  LAD Dissection:  Patient with LAD dissection during catheterization, s/p 3 DES for the dissection.
Her EKGs were unchanged with a sinus rhythm and LBBB with elevated j points, but no changes after catheterization.
Cardiac enzymes were trended and had a slight expected increase in troponins.
Given the amount of contrast and the patient's age, she was at increased risk for contrast induced nephropathy.
We gave 2L of normal saline as well as 2 doses of mucomyst and 6hours of sodium bicarb for renal protection.
# Hypertension:  Normotensive while in the CCU.
# Migraines: She has a history of migraines, and while in house she was given IV compazine which helped.
# Chronic Back Pain:  Stable.
