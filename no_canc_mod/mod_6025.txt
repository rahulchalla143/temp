No evidence of acute traumatic injury within the abdomen or pelvis.
Chronic appearing compression deformities of the T12 and L2 vertebral bodies.
orbital fracture or signs of ocular entrapment or injury  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:    88 year old woman with fall and R orbital hematoma REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:    ?
orbital fracture or signs of ocular entrapment or injury CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:    None.
Right preseptal periorbital hematoma without evidence of facial fracture.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a defect in the floor of the right orbit laterally.
However, there is no evidence of hemorrhage in the maxillary sinus.
These findings suggest an old blow out fracture of the orbital floor.
the association with evidence of right frontal trauma argues in favor of an acute fracture, but the absence of bood in the sinus indicates that this is likely old.
There is partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells, but no fracture is detected.
ELBOW XR: LEFT ELBOW, TWO VIEWS: There is a moderately distracted olecranon fracture with 8.9 mm distraction of the fracture fragments.
There is no other fracture.
Evaluation for joint effusion is limited due to lack of a true lateral view.
Distal humeral fixation hardware is partially imaged at the edge of the field of view.

Brief Hospital Course: Pt was transfered in from [**Hospital6 **] via med flight for acute R SDH after fall.
Repeat CT scan demonstrated interval increase in the size of the acute R SDH.
In the am it was reported that she had LUE weakness by RN staff.
Stat head CT revealed new right deep frontal contusion with post operative changes and pneumocephalus.
At this time she had no eye opening to voice or stim, no pupillary response, + corneal on the left only, + cough and gag to suction, with occassional over-breathing of the vent.
As well as CT oribits and mandible was obtained without acute findings.
