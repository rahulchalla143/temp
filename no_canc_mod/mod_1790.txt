Admission Date:  [**2183-12-14**]              Discharge Date:   [**2183-12-16**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**] Chief Complaint: found unresponsive  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: arterial line placed, [**2180-12-14**] central venous line placed, [**2183-12-14**]  History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 11060**] is an 87 year old woman with history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and previous DVT on warfarin who was BIBA after found down.
She received one dose of levofloxacin and clindamycin for community-acquired and aspiration pneumonia coverage.
Past Medical History: - Persistent atrial fibrillation (previously on sotalol, which was ineffective; now on amiodarone) on warfarin - Hypertension - Deep venous thrombosis ([**2175**])   Social History: Lives in [**Location (un) 538**] in senior housing.
No tobacco, EtOH, or illicits.
EKG [**12-14**]: atrial fibrillation with normal axis, normal intervals.
Lateral T-wave inversions.
CT Head [**12-14**]: Findings suspicious for large evolving Right MCA infarct w/ loss of grey-white and edema.
No hemorrhage.
CT C-spine [**12-14**]: No fx or dislocation.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**12-14**]: No acute traumatic injury.
LLL consolidation concering for aspiration.
Brief Hospital Course: Ms. [**Known lastname 11060**] is an 87yF found down at home, admitted with respiratory failure, evolving right MCA infarct, acute renal failure, elevated CK, elevated troponin, likely pneumonia, and lactic acidosis.
This was felt to be due to a combination of altered mental status and pneumonia (LLL consolidation- presumed aspiration).
Felt to be caused by either hypovolemia in setting of dehydration versus infection (elevated lactate on admission).
The hypotension was fluid responsive, after which the patient maintained a normal-range blood pressure without pressure requirments.
An arterial line was placed for closer BP monitoring; treatment with unasyn to cover CAP/Aspiration + urinary sources .
It was felt that patient would likely be left significant neurological deficits s/p her CVA.
#) Acute renal failure.
This was thought to be secondary to hypotension (pre-renal etiology) vs. rhabdomyolysis.
Thought to be due to dehydration/poor oral intake for >24 hours.
Given the large size of her infarct however, mild hypernatremia was tolerated to try to limit further neurological damage.
Presumed due to rhabdomyolysis from prolonged immobilization.
#) Elevated troponin.
NSTEMI in setting of hypotension vs. demand ischemia from elevated heart rate vs. troponin leak from skeletal muscle in the setting of rhabdo.
Associated ECG changes were considered cerebral versus ischemic T waves.
#) Dispostion: In light of her poor overall prognosis, on the second hospital day, the goals of care were transitioned to patient comfort; she expired shortly thereafter, on [**2183-12-16**].
Medications on Admission: Coumadin digoxin  Discharge Medications: none  Discharge Disposition: Expired  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: right MCA infarct c/b respiratory failure and hypotension  Secondary: atrial fibrillation hypertension  Discharge Condition: deceased  Discharge Instructions: N/A  Followup Instructions: N/A
