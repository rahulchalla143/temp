She related being in much distress for the rest of the day and not feeling herself.
She also states that she had been feeling more SOB with cough lately.
Around midnight, she had increased coughing and SOB and asked her daughter for a pill that her outside PCP in NY prescribed for her.
When EMS arrived, pt had a pulse but was not breathing so they intubated her on the field and she was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
For brief episodes of hypotension she was given 5L NS and then placed on levophed and neo very shortly but is currently not on pressors and has only PIVs.
She still relates a persistent cough with some sputum without blood.

# Respiratory Distress - Pt was initially seen in the MICU prior to transfer.
She states that she began to experience shortness of breath and coughing spells later in the evening after discovering her storage facility had been robbed that morning.
She deferred and instead told her daughter to bring her either an [**Name (NI) 54897**] or Levofoxacin.
The daughter called 911 and started chest compressions per their instructions.
EMS arrived on the scene and saw that she had a pulse but was not breathing.
In the MICU, she was seen by ORL who cleared her for airway edema prior to extubation.
She was successfully extubated and continued on steroids for a 3 day burst to prevent delayed anaphylactic reaction and nebs.
She briefly developed stridor which responded well to racemic epinephrine.
She did not show any residual complications from the initial respiratory distress.
Her oxygen requirements were titrated down while she in-house and on discharge she did not have any requirements.
Due to her changing story of the actual incident, it was mentioned that an anaphylactic reaction might be questionable since pt later denied ever taking any medication just prior to the incident.
# Chronic cough - Pt continued to have coughing spells with nonbloody sputum production.
CXRs were negative for any infiltrates or pneumonia.
# MSK chest pain - Pt complained of chest pain following admission to the floors.
A CXR and dedicated rib film showed no fractures.
Cardiac enzymes and EKGs demonstrated no acute cardiac processes.
The chest pain was likely secondary to chest compressions that the daughter performed at home before EMS arrived.
Pt later denied her daughter giving her chest compressions though she was not conscious at the time.
It was explained to her that it would take time for pain associated with rib bruising to dissipate.
Pt was able to ambulate and breathe without oxygen requirement on discharge.
# Anxiety - Pt related mental distress due to the robbery preceding her respiratory distress.
