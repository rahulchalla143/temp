male with dm, htn, dyslipidemia, djd, atrial fibrillation who was admitted for total knee replacement surgery which he underwent on [**2167-4-7**].
His post op course was c/b hypotension for which he was placed on neosynepherine gtt.
He then developed atrial fibrillation with RVR with rates =150.
His atrial fibrillation remained poorly controlled and thus he was transferred to medicine for further management.

[**2117-5-18**], Nixon president.
CXR: [**4-9**] Small left pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis developed yesterday, are stable.
Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
Pleural thickening extending from the right costal pleural surface into the minor fissure has been present without change since [**2163**], of no active clinical significance.
No pneumothorax, mediastinal widening or right pleural effusion.
[**9-22**] stress: 6 mins on modified [**Doctor First Name **]- test stopped due to fatigue.
No anginal sx LVEF = 59% and no ischemia identified.
Echo: [**3-/2164**] The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy.
The aortic Valve leaflets (3) are mildly  thickened but not stenotic.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve  leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial  mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
PFTs [**2-23**]: Mild restrictive defect .
M with DM, HTN, Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter s/p L TKR whose post op course was complicated by hypotension requring neo, low grade fevers, cough and atrial fibrillation with rapid response.
Rhythm: The pt has known Atrial Fibrillation and developed rapid ventricular response post op.
The etiology of the rapid ventricular response was initinally unclear, however the ddx included CHF, COPD flare, PNA, PE, or stress secondary to post op.
LENIs were negative for DVT, and the CXR was more consistent with Pulm edema rather than PNA.
He was therefore treated symptomatically for his Atrial fibrillation and was also diursed aggressively with lasix to remove the source of stimulation.
In addition, he was also started on coumadin anticoagulation as well for dual benefit of Atrial fibrillation and TKR ppx.
At time of discharge, his medication regimen for Atrial fibrillation consisted of Amiodarone 200mg once daily as well as metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and coumadin 3mg QHS.
Ischemia: Although unlikely, ischemia could not be ruled out as a cause of rapid ventricular response.
In addition, ECGs were without acute ST or T wave changes.
C.  Pump: The pt was clinically in overt CHF with pulm edema visible on CXR as well as physical exam and LE edema with elevated JVP.
As an outpt, he should be continued on 80mg PO lasix (the PO equivalent to IV lasix) with close monitoring of his kidney function.
Apply a dry sterile dressing to the wound each day while it is draining.
You may begin showering with a waterproof dressing over the wound after being discharged from the hospital.
You can shower normally (no bandage) starting one week after surgery (as long as there is no drainage from the wound.
If the wound is draining, wait 24 hours after it has stopped before showering) - pat the incision dry with a towel, do not rub the incision.
Monitor the wound daily for signs of infection including redness around the incision that is warm to the touch, pus-like drainage from the wounds, fever/chills, temp>101.5, or any other symptoms that concern you.
ID: The pt also complained of a productive cough, with low grade temps and wheezing which was concerning for PNA/bronchitis vs. COPD exacerbation (given known h/o tobacco use).
The pt was monitored closely for other signs of infection (chills, rigors, WBC count, bacteremia).
He was therefore treated empirically for COPD exacerbation and CHF.
The CHF was treated as above, while his COPD was managed with the addition of flovent and standing nebulizer treatments of atrovent and albuterol.
The pt continued to have some wheezing throughout the remainder of the hospital course but his respiratory status remained stable and he was without any evidence of infection.
However given the decompensated CHF, the pt was not started back on sulfonylureas for risk of hypoglycemia.
This was thought to be due to narcotics and post op pain.

Several changes in your medications have been made after discussion with your other doctors.
If you notice an increase in body weight of more than 3lbs, please call your PCP as this may indicate a need to change your lasix (furosemide) dosage.
