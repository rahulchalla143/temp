Pt presented to OSH on [**2136-9-23**] with CHF exacerbation after not taking his medications for three days (pt reportedly unable to pay for the medications).
Developed acute renal failure with diuresis (crt 1.5--->2.3).
Additionally, on admission to OSH, he was noted to have increasing LE edema & ascites (which he has had in "moderate" amounts in past, as documented by US & CT at OSH).
Despite reported h/o ascites & LE edema, pt reportedly has no pulm HTN/RV failure on OSH imaging.
Concern raised about possible constrictive/restritive pericarditis causing sx's.
He reported feeling slightly more dyspneic at rest than earlier in day.
He appeared uncomfortable breathing & had near tense ascites.
On review of systems, pt notes occasional pleuritic CP with deep breath.
Pt has significant LE edema at baseline.
He reports no yellowing of skin, light colored stool, abdominal pain, or pruritis.
He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Crackles anteriorly & posteriorly, though posterior exam limited.
No HSM or tenderness.
Ext: [**12-31**]+ pitting edema b/l lower exts.
Mild stasis dermatitis.
Skin: warm, dry  Pertinent Results: EKG demonstrated low voltages, afib w/ average ventric response of 100bpm, LAD, poor R wave progression, TWI in aVL & flattening in I.
Stress MIBI performed on [**6-1**] at [**Hospital3 17921**] Center demonstrated: mild global hypokinesis, EF 45%, and no evidence of ischemia .
Low lung volumes are noted.
In addition there is a well-circumscribed round opacity at the right base seen on one image.
There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature that is slightly indistinct with associated cephalad re-distribution suggestive of underlying pulmonary edema.
There is soft tissue fullness within the AP window.
This may be exaggerated secondary to the patient's low lung volumes however cannot exclude underlying lymphadenopathy and/or mass.
Mild pulmonary edema.
Left retrocardiac opacity likely secondary to underlying atelectasis and a small-to-moderate sized effusion, difficult to exclude pneumonia.
Fullness within the AP window concerning for underlying lymphadenopathy.
TTE Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %).
Right ventricular chamber size is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and moderate biventricular global hypokinesis.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with patent LMCA.
LAD nad LCX had only mild disease.
RCA had mild to moderate disease.
Hemodynamic assessment revealed near equalization of the right and left sided filling pressures.
There was no respiratory variation in the RA pressure or RVEDP.
There was discordance with respirations between RV and LV pressures consistent with contriction.

# CHF: acute on chronic, likely systolic failure.
Right sided heart cath showed:Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with patent LMCA.
LAD nad LCX had only mild disease.
RCA had mild to moderate disease.
Hemodynamic assessment revealed near equalization of the right and left sided filling pressures.
There was no respiratory variation in the RA pressure or RVEDP.
There was discordance with respirations between RV and LV pressures consistent with constriction.
Echocardiography was suggestive of infiltration and there was concern for an infiltrative process but a Heme-onc consult did not feel this was consistent with amyloidosis.
SAAG from tap  >1.1, suggesting transudative process.
No abd discomfort.
No h/o liver disease/cirrhosis.
No h/o IVDU or h/o hep B/C.
Serosanguinous ascitic fluid likely from traumatic tap, cytology was negative for malignant cells and pathology shows inflammatory cells and histiocytes.
Patient screened for hemochromatosis, and multiple myeloma.
# Atrial fibrillation chronic condition.
# NSVT: pt has had long h/o this, including EP study at OSH w/o inducible VT.  No h/o syncope.
The patient was asymptomatic during all of these episodes during this hospitalization.
Patient was treated for CHF with improvement of effusions with diuresis.
DM II: Patient was placed on an insulin sliding scale and given a diabetic diet.
Iron studies consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
