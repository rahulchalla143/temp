Admission Date:  [**2154-4-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2154-5-22**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**] Chief Complaint: Found down  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endotracheal intubation ([**2154-4-23**]) A-line placement Tracheostomy ([**2154-5-13**]) PEG Tube ([**2154-5-13**])  History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] yo female with CAD s/p MI, pulmonary HTN, HTN, who found down in her house after a few weeks of fatigue and weakness 9 days ago.
Per neuro note in talking with the son, over the last month the patient had weakness, fatigue, and was too weak to go up stairs.
EKG showed LVH with lat/inf ST depressions as well as evidence of left main disease.
She was reintubated on [**2154-4-30**] for hypercarbia in setting of mental status changes, and hypoventilation.
Neurology was then consulted for question of central etiology for respiratory failure.
Coronary artery disease    - s/p MI ('[**44**]) 2.
Mild MR 3.
Moderate TR 4.
Hypertension 5.
Hyperlipidemia 6.
Goiter (non-toxic) 9. h/o airway obstruction   Social History: Lives independently.
Physical Exam: vitals - T 97.5, BP 133/69, HR 72, RR 16 and 100% on 100% FI02 gen - intubated and sedated; obese heent - pupils 4mm --> 2mm bilaterally; no conjunctival palor or icterus neck - RIJ in place; large anterior neck, but difficult to palpate any clear nodules cv - rrr, no murmurs heard chest - clear with audible vent; no crackles heard abd - soft, mildly distended; no bowel sounds heard ext - warm; non-pitting edema bilaterally neuro - could not assess mental status as intubated and sedated; reflex difficult to assess but appear diminished; toes ?
Scooped ST depressions noted in I, II, F, V4-V6 with elevations in R and V1.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is an echo-lucency (3mm) seen in tha basal infero-septum and inferior wall that is suggestive of a small diverticulum (there is no color flow to suggest a small VSD or intra-myocardial coronary bridge but thesse cannot be excluded).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
1+ MR.  CXR ([**2154-4-23**]): Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS ([**2154-4-23**]): There is a 4.9 x 3.3 cm heterogeneous mass in the right lobe of the thyroid gland causing some displacement of the esophagus and the trachea across the midline.
Small right pleural effusion noted.
No evidence of pulmonary emboli.
No evidence for dissection of the aorta.
Atherosclerotic changes are noted throughout the aorta.
Lung windows show some patchy scattered nodular infiltrates which may represent infectious process or atelectasis.
Band like atelectasis is also noted in the right middle lobe.
There is a 1.7 x 1.5 cm nodule in the left adrenal gland.
No focal lesions are seen in the liver, spleen, or the pancreas.
No gallstones.
Kidneys are otherwise normal, no hydronephrosis.
Oral contrast was not used for this study limiting evaluation of bowel loops but no gross abnormalities are seen.
A 4 cm densely calcified fibroid noted in relation to the uterus.
No ascites is seen.
CT HEAD ([**2154-4-23**]): There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, or major vascular territorial infarction.
A lacunar infarct is observed in the left frontal white matter.
There is mild ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with CAD found down and now with neuromuscular weakness and respiratory failure s/p trach.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure- Pt was reintubated on [**2154-4-30**] for hypercarbia and tiring out.
Post etomidate and intubation she had flaccid paralysis.
She was treated for a possible aspiration pneumonia for seven days at that time.
She does have underlying pulmonary disease by [**2150**] PFTs however, this was thought to be secondary to the neurological cause.
As her muscular weakness (see below) was treated, her ability to initiate breaths and diaphragmatic musculature got better, initially being on AC without any spontaneous respirations.
She was diuresed with IV and PO lasix through her stay as she was edematous and anasacic.
MRI and MRA of the head showed nothing acute to account for this and MRI of the c-spine only showed some stenosis.
EMG on HD 10 showed decreased CMAPs but was sural nerve sparing, though on the whole non-diagnostic.
Acetylcholinesterase antibodies were negative, anti-MUSK ab, anti voltage gated Ca channel ab, and [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **] ab all were negative.
CT chest was done to look for evidence of malignancy (?
CAD- EKG on admission showed left main disease (ST elevations in avr, V1, V2).
Her enzymes were positive with peak troponin to >1.6 with a positive MB index.
Echo was initially hyperdynamic but echo on HD 8 showd new inferior and inferoseptal wall motion abnormalities.
Pt'[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and HCTZ were held in the initial setting of hypotension and then held as other agents were thought to be medically superior.
Hematuria- On HD 16, pt had a large amount of hematuria requiring a 3 way foley/ bladder irrigation.
U/a was positive for evidence of infection, though UCx never grew out any bacteria.
Hearing loss- towards the mid-end of hospitalization with decreased hearing.
Acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet [**Last Name (STitle) **]: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed for fever, pain.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure  Secondary: 2.
Hypotension 3.
Hyponatremia 4.
Coronary artery disease 5.
Hypertension 6.
Hyperlipidemia 7.
Thyroid nodule 8.
In addition to the above, you were found to have a small nodule on your adrenal gland.
