Admission Date:  [**2114-10-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2114-10-25**]  Date of Birth:   [**2065-7-29**]     Sex:  F  Service:  CCU  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49 year-old woman with idiopathic cardiomyopathy diagnosed one to two months ago with an EF ranging from 25 to 40% on various echocardiograms, Hodgkin's lymphoma at age 18 treated with chemotherapy as well as radiation therapy to the mediastinum, history of left bundle branch block, hypertension, coronary artery disease, who presents from the outside hospital with presenting symptoms being nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, dyspnea on exertion and weakness for two days.
Although she has had dyspnea on exertion as well as weakness in the past and this is correlated with pulmonary edema, she has never had associated nausea and vomiting and diarrhea in the past.
She had two days of these symptoms and then had near syncope on the two days prior to admission and on that day she was admitted to [**Hospital3 36606**] Hospital in [**Hospital1 189**].
There she ruled in for a nonST elevation myocardial infarction with a peak CK of 427 and an MB of 21 and a troponin of 5.82.
She developed a junctional rhythm with a rate of 44 and a blood pressure of 90/48 at that time.
Known coronary artery disease with workup to date as follows, cardiac catheterization on [**6-13**] showed a codominant system with a 50 to 60% lesion at the left circumflex and 80 to 90% right coronary artery osteal narrowing, normal left ventricular EF, moderate 2+ mitral regurgitation, wedge of 22 and pulmonary artery pressure 40/22.
Echocardiogram of [**6-18**] showed an EF of 40%, left atrial enlargement, normal left ventricular dimensions, 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
ETT on [**9-10**] exercise nine minutes on [**Doctor First Name **] protocol, stopped for chest tightness and progressive dyspnea on exertion.
Echocardiogram on [**9-6**] left atrial dilation, moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with EF of 25%, 4+ mitral regurgitation and no pericardial effusion.
Cardiac catheterization on [**8-18**], right coronary artery osteal lesion 80%, EF 41% and 2+ mitral regurgitation.
An exercise MIBI in [**8-18**] showed a mild septal wall defect.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction or angina known in the family.
SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco or ethanol.
She ruled in for myocardial infarction by enzymes at the outside hospital as described above.
Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 78 with a left bundle branch block, which is old.
No pulmonary edema.
No cardiomegaly.
IMPRESSION:  This is a 49 year-old female with a recent history of congestive heart failure in the setting of hypertension and one vessel coronary artery disease involving the osteal of the right coronary artery.
She is transferred with recent GI complaints that were followed by shortness of breath and junctional rhythm, increased troponin and transient hypotension.
Cardiovascular:  A:  Coronary artery disease:  The patient ruled in for a nonST elevation myocardial infarction at the outside hospital.
Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 69**] she went to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where a left heart catheterization revealed 99% right coronary artery osteal stenosis with TIMI one flow.
B:  Ventricular function:  Hemodynamics measured a cardiac catheterization revealed significantly elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 15, mean PAP of 22, mean wedge of 15 and LVEDP of 16.
Left ventriculogram showed anterolateral wall hypokinesis and the LVEF was calculated at 50%.
No significant mitral regurgitation was seen.
C:  Rate and rhythm:  There is no recurrence of the patient's junctional rhythm and in fact this had resolved by the time she was admitted to our hospital.
Hematology:  The patient's hematocrit dropped by six points over the first night of her admission, however, this was felt secondary to hemodilution.
Recheck of the hematocrit revealed that the hematocrit was stable and no bleeding was suspected.
NonST elevation myocardial infarction.
