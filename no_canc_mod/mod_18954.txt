1st episodes of syncope occurred a week prior after an extra HD session with 6L fluid removed, although pt denies preceding symptoms.
He had several more episodes of syncope and traumatic falls resulting in hitting his head on the driveway, and losing consciousness for a few minutes.
According to wife, associated with upper extremity shaking and eyes rolling up in the head, lasting a few minutes.
No urine or stool incontinence, no post-ictal states.
CT of head on admission showed no acute event, + for marked microvascular disease.
As part of syncope w/u he underwent cardiac cath which revealed 3VD.
During the procedure, pt developed R extremity weakness and dysarthria, MRI demonstrated multiple small cerebral and cerebeallar emboli without hemorrhage.
The patient continued to experience several episodes of unresponsiveness with temporary worsening of his R sided weakness.
At least one was during dialysis, ?
MRI repeated [**7-22**] with progression of infarct in L frontal lobe.
Unable to find cause of his multiple emboli, work-up for vasculitis and hypercoagulable states recommended as outpatient.
Pt discharged to rehab for 5 days, doing well with ambulation, no episodes of syncope.
Pt went home in the afternoon of [**7-29**] feeling fatigued, mildly disoriented.
That night pt with PND while sleeping with one pillow on flat bed (had been in semi-upright bed in hospital).

Cardiac Risk Factors: Diabetes, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension .
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
No thrills, lifts.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Abd: + old scar across upper abdomen with several poorly healed scars, escar presents, no erythema or purulent discharge.
No HSM or tenderness.
No abdominial bruits.
No femoral bruits.
+ RUE AVF with good bruit Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
+ R facial droop, decreased R sided facial sensation, tongue deviates to the R. Motor [**6-14**] upper and lower extremities b/l.
ST depression anterolaterally in I, aVL, V4-V6 unchanged from [**2183-6-10**].
TEE [**2183-7-17**]: mild LV dilation with evidence of inferior, inferolateral and anterolateral apical infarction, EF 25%, mild MR. .
CARDIAC CATH [**7-17**] demonstrated: LMCA - large, slightly ectacic, non-obstructive LAD - very large, wraps around apex.
30-40% proximal with 95% complex lesions at the take off of a large diagonal.
30-40% plaquing distally.
LCx - a large vessel totalle occluded after OM1.
60%-69% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery.
Less than 40% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
[**7-31**]: CXR no evidence of failure .
[**7-31**]: ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral akinesis, and distal septal/apical hypokinesis, consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with moderate to severe regional systolic dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
[**8-2**] MRI/A: FINDINGS: BRAIN MRI: IMPRESSION: Foci of hyperintense signal within left centrum semiovale and in the anterior portion of the right centrum semiovale on diffusion images with corresponding T2 and FLAIR abnormalities.
In absence of ADC map, it could not be confirmed whether these are due to acute infarcts or due to T2 shine through.
No mass effect or hydrocephalus seen.
MRA OF THE NECK: IMPRESSION: Right internal carotid artery demonstrates signal loss and narrowing of the flow signal suggestive of high-grade stenosis.
Gadolinium-enhanced MRA or CTA would help for further assessment of the stenosis if clinically indicated.
The lesion in the mid LAD was predilated with a 1.5mm and 2.0 mm balloons, stented with two 3.0 mm stents and post dilated with a 3.5 mm balloon with lesion reduction to 0%.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, no dissection, no perforation and no embolisation.
Brief Hospital Course: Pt is a 60 yo M with h/o ESRD, IDDM, CAD, CHF (EF 15-20%), CVA (1 mo ago during cath), and autonomic dysfunction who is transferred here after returning with increasing shortness of breath and recently diagnosed 3VD.
He was mildly overloaded on exam and improved with HD the following morning.
CAD: pt evaluated with cardiac cath recently although no clear evidence of ischemia at that time.
We obtained baseline CE and an echo which showed function impaired by 3VD.
EKG was unchanged from prior with anterolateral persistent ST depressions and T wave inversions.
After neurology evaluated patient's MRI/A and taking into consideration patient's comorbidities and witnessed recurrence of CVA symptoms with decreased blood pressure, patient was determined by CT Surgery to be high risk for open heart surgery and the decision was made to undergo PCI.
A TEE was obtained to determine location/severity of aortic atheroma so as to guide PCI approach.
[**8-6**] cath revealed a mid LAD lesion of 80% and a 70% instent restenosis distal to this lesion.
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, no dissection, no perforation and no embolization.
CVA: outpatient MRI showed evidence of multiple emoblic strokes.
Improving R sided paresis and R facial palsy during admission.
Gabapentin for neuropathy was d/c'd due to concern for hypotension.
You were started on a new medication, Plavix, which will help to thin your blood to prevent clots around these stents.
Your lisinopril was decreased to 2.5mg daily and your lasix was decreased to 40mg twice daily because of your low blood pressure.
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you experience any further chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or excessive bleeding.
If recurrent angina occurs, consider elective PCI of RCA.
