ANAEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2126-3-6**]):    NO GROWTH.
EKG [**2-25**]:  Sinus tachycardia and occasional ventricular ectopy.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2125-7-24**] there are now more prominent Q waves suggesting interim inferior myocardial infarction.
Both atrial and ventricular ectopy have appeared, the rate has increased and there is more prominent downsloping ST segment depression in leads V5-V6.
Rule out myocardial infarction.
Abdominal aortic angiography demonstrated moderate distal disease with a small infrarenal saccular aneurysm.
Nonselective angiography of the bilateral, single renal arteries demonstrated 40% proximal disease bilaterally.
The right CIA had a 50% lesion in the origin with a 6 mmHg mean gradient after administration of IA nitroglycerin.
There was diffuse disease in the rightIIA with up to 50% stenoses.
The left CIA had proximal 60% disease with a 40 mmHg peak-to-peak gradient.
The IIA had diffuse 40% disease.
The left PFA had a 50% lesion at its origin.
No angiographically apparent, flow-limiting disease was noted in the popliteal aftery.
The AT had serial lesions with a total occlusion in the mid-shin.
Slow filling was noted of the DP.
The  peroneal had mild disease and terminated at the ankle.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, a small proximal perforation, a distal perforation treated with prolonged balloon inflation and protamine, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
Successful treatment of ostial left PFA disease with a 5.0 x 18 mm Highsail balloon.
Final angigoraphy demonstrated a 30% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow (See PTCA Comments).
Mild abdominal aorta and renal artery disease.
Moderate disease in the right CIA and IIA.
Diffuse disease in left lower extremity with totally occluded SFA.
Arterial Duplex [**2-27**]:  IMPRESSION: No evidence of left leg pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula.
The abdominal aorta had mild distal disease.
The right lower extremity was significant for a right CIA with a tubular 70% lesion.
The left lower extremity was significant for a left CIA with a 90% focal lesion.
The EIA had an 80% lesion in the midsegment as well as a 90% distal EIA lesion.
The CFA had no significant disease.
An 8.0 x 28 mm Dynalink self-expanding stent was delivered to the proximal EIA and postdilated with a 6.0 x 12 mm Viatrack balloon at 12 ATM.
Final angiography demonstrated a 10% residual stenosis in the PFA, no residual stenosis, in the SFA, no residual stenosis in the EIA, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow.
The left proximal CIA lesion was dilated with an 8.0 x 38 mm Genesis stent at 12 ATM.
Final angiography demonstrated no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow.
A perforation was noted which was treated with multiple 5 minute balloon inflations, administration of protamine, and finally placement of an 8.0 x 30 mm WallGraft covered stent postdilated with an 8.0 mm SDS balloon.
Significant disease in the right CIA.
Significant disease in the left CIA, EIA, SFA, and PFA.
EKG [**2-27**]:  Sinus rhythm with first degree A-V delay.
Probable left atrial abnormality.
Prominent inferior Q waves - are nonspecific.
Modest nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Since previous tracing of [**2126-2-26**], first degree A-V delay present and ST-T wave changes decreased.
CT ABD/PELVIS [**2-27**] 8 p.m.:  IMPRESSION: Retroperitoneal hemorrhage worse on the left, consistent with the history of iliac artery perforation, although the exact origin of this hemorrhage is not identified on this CT.
Persistent contrast within the renal collecting system which is concerning for contrast induced nephropathy.
Probable prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2126-2-27**] the ST segment depressions and T wave inversions are slightly more prominent in leads II, III and aVF and there is new downsloping ST segment depression and T wave inversion in leads V5-V6.
Rule out myocardial infarction.
It is uncertain whether this represents a recurrent acute process (pneumonia, aspiration) or a progressive abnormaltiy.
Brief Hospital Course: 78 year old female with CAD and severe PVD, presents for elective stent of significant biaortoiliac disease.
Final angiography demonstrated 30% residual PFA stenosis, no residual stenosis of the L SFA, a small proximal perforation of the L SFA, a distal perforation treated with prolonged balloon inflation and protamine, and normal flow.
The L CIA at this time had 60% disease, the L internal iliac artery 40% disease, and the L distal external iliac artery 60% disease.
Final angiography demonstrated a 10% residual stenosis of the L PFA, no residual stenosis in the SFA, no residual stenosis in the EIA, no angiographically apparent dissection, and normal flow.
L CIA and R CIA were both dilated and stented.
This demonstrated retroperitoneal hemorrhage worse on the left, consistent with the history of iliac artery perforation, although the exact origin of this hemorrhage was not identified on this CT.  Aproximately 8 hours after transfer to the CCU post her second catheterization, the patient complained of abdominal pain.
She was noted to have hypoactive bowel sounds and a rigid tender abdomen, and was therefore sent for a repeat stat CT of the abdomen/pelvis which showed interval increase in the amount of retroperitoneal hemorrhage, however the amount of increase over the 8 hours since the previous CT scan was not considered excessive, and the patient was hemodynamically stable throughout, therefore it was decided to manage conservatively with PRBC transfusion and clinical/laboratory observation.
The patient remained hemodynamically stable, and her hematocrit remained stable status post 4 units of PRBCs over 24 hours.
3) CAD:  The patient did have a number of episodes of chest pain between the first and second catheterizations.
These episodes were accompanied by EKG changes consisting of ST depressions in the lateral leads (V3-V6) of up to 3 mm.
4) Complete heart block:  1 day after her second catheterization she was noted to have a 6 second period of complete heart block during which time she had an atrial rate of approximately 75 beats per minute.
She was also noted to have had several alarms for bradycardia down to 39 post her first catheterization.
Fortunately, she did not have any further episodes of CHB, though she did continue to have transiet bradycardia to the 30s.
She had no syncopal or pre-syncopal episodes, nor was she ever symptomatic or unstable during her episodes of bradycardia.
She was also noted to have persistent nephrograms on CT scan (performed for her RP bleed, as above), which raised concern for contrast induced nephropathy.
8) Fever:  The patient had a fever on the day before discharge.
A CXR revealed a retrocardiac opacity which had been seen on previous CXRs.
Treatment was therefore not initiated, and the patient did not have any further fevers.
She should have a repeat CXR at some point to assess for interval change in this opacity.
