Admission Date:  [**2171-6-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2171-6-25**]  Date of Birth:  [**2122-10-20**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 832**] Chief Complaint: Respiratory distress  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Intubation PEG tube placement   History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 50946**] is a 48 year old woman with a history of depression, anxiety, bipolar, and hypertension.
EMS was called and the patient was transfered to OSH for altered mental status.
A CT head showed frontal parietal lesion, concerning for a mass.
CXR was concerning for fluid overload vs. pneumonia.
Differential included low grade neoplasm, a subacute infarct, encephalitis or another inflammatory process, or tumefactive demyelination.
An initial u/a showed positive nitrites.

Diagnostic considerations include a low grade neoplasm, a subacute infarct, encephalitis or another inflammatory process (though location is atypical), and tumefactive demyelination (such as MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]).
Large left MCA territory infarction, predominantly involving the cortex and the subcortical white matter with possible scattered small punctate foci of petechial hemorrhage.
There is minimal mass effect upon the involved sulci without mass effect upon the ventricular system or shift of midline structures.
There is extensive paranasal sinus disease with air-fluid levels within the ethmoid, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses.
The MRA of the head demonstrates complete loss of flow signal within the left ICA with collateral flow to the supraclinoid left ICA, MCA and ACA, which is less in flow intensity compared with the contralateral side, which is likely an result of contralateral collateral flow.
The left MCA is apparently globally smaller in caliber than the contralateral side, also likely a result of contralateral flow.
No evidence of focal stenosis to suggest vasculitis, although CTA is more sensitive and can be performed if clinically warranted.
In correlation with the CTA of the head and neck (performed at the time of this  interpritation) the vessel appears hypoplastic although occlusion can not be excluded.
Occlusion of distal segment I through segment VI of left internal carotid artery, with reconstitution of segment VII.
Cause is unclear; MRA neck w/ T1 Fat/Sat recommended if there is concern for dissection.
Left MCA smaller in size and number of branches than right, consistent with known left MCA large area of CVA.
No evidence for vasculitis.
Smooth narrowing and tapering of the left proximal ICA with narrowing of the middle and distal segments, with intracranial reconstitution suggesting chronic non occlusive dissection or partial recanalisation.
Diminished flow-related enhancement of the left V3 vertebral segment as seen on the CT study.
Expected evolution of large left MCA territory infarct with increased mass effect.
While the left midbrain is slightly crowded, there is no uncal herniation.
Mild hemorrhagic transformation of the left MCA territory infarction.
Fluid in the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells, likely due to endotracheal and nasogastric intubation.
Expected evolution of large left MCA territorial infarct, with stable 3-mm rightward shift of normally-midline structures and no central herniation.
New subtle foci of hyperdensity within the superior portion of the infarcted territory; small focal hemorrhagic transformation is a  consideration.
The latter has progressed since the previous study of earlier the same date, and is accompanied by worsening perihilar and basilar airspace opacities.
Findings likely reflect worsening pulmonary edema.
Considering the marked increase in size of the cardiac silhouette compared to a baseline radiograph of [**2170-6-23**], pericardial effusion should be considered.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with with focal hypokinesis of the distal 2/3s of the left ventricle.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Focal left ventricular dysfunction involving the mid and distal left ventricular segments, likely of non-coronary etiology (stress-mediated/Takotsubo's, myocarditis, etc..).
Mild right ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior, septal, distal LV and apical hypokinesis to akinesis (the distal LV and apex are thinned and akinetic).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect.
RV with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CXR [**6-15**]-FINDINGS: Radiograph centered at thoracoabdominal junction was obtained forassessment of nasogastric tube.
With this in mind, advancement by several centimeterswould be helpful for standard positioning.
Cardiac silhouette remainsmarkedly enlarged and is accompanied by mild pulmonary edema and small pleuraleffusions.
CXR [**6-21**]- Extensive bilateral opacification of the lungs is unchanged , most likely consistent with pulmonary edema.
Underlying infection cannot be excluded.
Bilateral pleural effusion is most likely present.
Brief Hospital Course: 48 yo F presenting with altered mental status, brain lesion on imaging, and respiratory distress requiring intubation.
Initially had altered mental status per report, concerning for drug overdose, but tox screen was negative.
Infectious work up was unrevealing but she was initially placed on vancomycin, zosyn, azithromycin and acyclovir given limited information and concern for sepsis from HCAP, atypical PNA, and meningitis/encephalitis.
She was subsequently switched to levofloxacin and Flagyl for Gram negatives/atypicals as well as possible aspiration PNA.
These antibiotics were discontinued after 4 days because of low likelihood of PNA in the absence of fever and leukocytosis.
She appears to have either suffered an acute internal carotid dissection or a cardioembolic stroke.
Neurology service was involved throughout and recommended anticoagulation with Coumadin for 3-6 months for primary stroke prevention after danger period for hemorrhagic conversion passed (7-10 days).
Patient was noted to have right-sided neglect and lack of purposeful movement on the right side.
The patient was intubated for hypoxia and AMS.
Initial CXR showed significant fluid overload and possible pneumonia (see above).
Cardiomyopathy: The patient developed findings of acute systolic heart failure.
She has no prior history of heart failure.
Initial echocardiogram was suggestive of stress-mediated/Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy with apical hypokinesis.
She had a repeat echo with persistent apical akinesis an EF of 25-30%.
She either suffered from stress-cardiomyopathy or less likely an acute ischemic cardiovascular event.
Acute renal failure: Patient had transient acute renal failure with Cr 1.2 compared to baseline of 0.9 from over-diuresis.
Clozaril was discontinued due to the high risk of severe side effects.
Leukocytosis: Persistent leukocytosis, initially thought to be most likely pulmonary infection and patient treated with levofloxacin for CAP.
Leukocytosis subsequently improved.
Moderate malnutrition- Patient failed speech and swallow on several occasions, and so, in discussion with her family, the decision was made to proceed with PEG placement.
She should have video swallow prior to any new feeding as she had silent aspiration on video swallow during this hospitalization.

Alert but not interactive Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Please continue to receive PT/OT and speech and swallow therapy.
You also had a heart attack.
For prevention of further stroke and heart attack, continue on blood thinners.
You should have daily INR and PTT checks while on the heparin and coumadin until a doctor determines that the frequency of these blood tests can be reduced.
