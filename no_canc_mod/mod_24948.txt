There was no history of fever or prolonged rupture of membranes.
This infant was born by stat Cesarean section because of prolonged bradycardia.
Mother was given general anesthesia for delivery.
After a minute of life, he developed spontaneous respiration.
He still had an oxygen requirement at that time, until after 5 minutes of life.
Lungs had shallow respirations with mild intercostal retractions and intermittent nasal flaring.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm with no murmur.

Spine is midline with no sacral dimple.
Respiratory:  On admission to the NICU, the infant was on     room air and had grunting, flaring and retracting.

He does have some mild nasal congestion.
Due to abnormal rib anomaly, orthopedics     recommended cardiology evaluation to rule out any cardiac     defects.
There is no left shift.
Orthopedic:  A chest x-ray was done on [**2148-1-16**] to evaluate     lung fields due to oxygen requirement at that time.
There     was a rib abnormality noted and there is a curvature of     the 5th and 6th right sided ribs.
At that time, orthopedics recommended the     cardiology consult which was subsequently done after that     and also a renal ultrasound, which was found to be     normal, to rule out any other congenital abnormalities.
