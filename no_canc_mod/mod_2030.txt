Admission Date:  [**2184-8-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2184-8-23**]  Date of Birth:   [**2110-10-4**]     Sex:  M  Service:  MICU Green  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient's chief complaint is shortness of breath.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old gentleman with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who presents with progressive shortness of breath times two days which was associated with a cough productive of white sputum.
He denies orthopnea or increased lower extremity edema.
There is a questioned episode of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea approximately three days prior to admission.
Of note, the patient's wife returned from Europe approximately ten days ago with upper respiratory tract symptoms.
She had encouraged her husband to seek and evaluation for his shortness of breath earlier, but the patient refused.
He was brought to the Emergency Department at the [**Hospital1 69**] via Emergency Medical Service on the morning of admission due to extreme difficulty breathing overnight.
A chest x-ray was done and showed no evidence of pneumonia of congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiograms were done showing no evidence of active ischemia.
The patient was given 80 mg of Solu-Medrol, 500 mg of levofloxacin, and continued on his albuterol nebulizers for a presumed acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
The patient continued to be tachypneic and breathing using accessory muscles.
Chronic atrial fibrillation.
Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (with the last pulmonary function tests in [**2184-6-3**] revealing an FEV1 of 0.64 (which is 21% of predicted value), an FVC of 2.27 (which is 48% of predicted value), and an FEV1:FVC ratio of 28 (which is 43% of predicted value).
He has a history of an upper gastrointestinal bleed in [**2176**].
His last echocardiogram in [**2182-3-7**] revealed a normal ejection fraction of greater than 55%, right ventricular hypertrophy, moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to PENICILLIN (which causes him to have mouth swelling) and SONATA (gives him a rash).
In general, he was somewhat uncomfortable-appearing and was breathing with accessory muscles.
Pulmonary examination was notable for coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination was notable for tachycardia with an irregular rhythm.
No murmurs were appreciated.
Abdominal examination showed a nondistended abdomen with positive bowel sounds.
The abdomen was soft and nontender.
His extremities were warm and well perfused and without edema, and there were no rashes noted on his skin.
PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed hyperinflation with no focal infiltrates and no pleural effusions.
Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 115 with left axis deviation.
There were Q waves in leads III and aVF (which were new since [**2180**]).
There were no ST segment changes.
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE EXACERBATION ISSUES:  The etiology of the shortness of breath and dyspnea was thought to be secondary to an exacerbation due to an upper respiratory tract infection.
On the evening of admission, the patient became increasingly agitated, and hypertensive, and tachycardic; complaining of hallucinations and confusion.
It was thought that these symptoms were due to alcohol withdrawal.
He later became increasingly hypercarbic with progressive mental status changes and was intubated secondary to hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of alcohol withdrawal and mental status changes early in the morning on hospital day two.
Later that evening, the patient became progressively more uncomfortable on face mask and increasingly more somnolent.
Blood gas again revealed hypercarbia, and the patient was reintubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to increasing oral secretions in the setting of progressive sedation.
The sedation and secretions improved in the subsequent days, and the patient was extubated on hospital day eight and remained stable.
Throughout his Medical Intensive Care Unit course, his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare was continually managed with levofloxacin (of which he completed 9 days of a 10-day course), steroids, and albuterol/Atrovent nebulizers.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  The patient remained persistently in atrial fibrillation throughout his Medical Intensive Care Unit course.
However, toward the end of his Medical Intensive Care Unit admission, the rate control was no longer adequate with Lopressor and diltiazem was added for rate control.
HYPERTENSIVE ISSUES:  The patient's blood pressure was initially managed with beta blockade alone; however, several days into the admission, the patient remained persistently hypertensive with systolic blood pressures ranging in the 160s to 170s and was subsequently started on captopril with improvement of his systolic blood pressures.
RENAL ISSUES:  The patient was admitted in acute renal failure with a creatinine of 1.7 (with his baseline being 1.1 to 1.4).
This acute renal failure was thought to be due to hypovolemia.
Additionally, the patient had hyperkalemia with a potassium of 5.1.
He never showed any electrocardiogram changes related to that potassium level and was managed with Kayexalate with a return of his potassium to normal levels.
