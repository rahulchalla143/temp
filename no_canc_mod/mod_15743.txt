ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 54-year-old female with an extensive past medical history as noted above who was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2139-3-17**], after she had initially presented to an outside hospital with complaints of bilateral buttock pain.
When she was seen and examined at the outside hospital she underwent CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis which showed soft tissue air bilaterally extending around the rectum and into the retroperitoneal tissue.
Otherwise she had some crackles at the bases of her lungs bilaterally.
In terms of the buttocks, there were bilateral 10 cm areas which were open with pus which tracked deep into the pelvis lateral to the rectum and, as noted, a significant amount of purulence was seen.
In terms of an electrocardiogram from the outside hospital, it was only notable for sinus tachycardia but no ischemic changes.
She had a chest x-ray also from that outside hospital which did not evidence any infiltrate and the CT scan findings as noted above.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the nature of the patient's extensive infection, it was determined that she needed to be taken to the Operating Room somewhat urgently for surgical debridement of this deep seated infection.
The patient tolerated the procedure and there was no note of excessive blood loss.
These did actually resolved within just a few minutes of being re-oriented to her surroundings and were felt to be secondary to patient's being in a foreign location.
Otherwise, aside from standard sedation when the patient was intubated and postoperative pain control with narcotics, the patient really had no neurologic issues.
From a respiratory standpoint, the patient was, as noted, intubated when she arrived and actually remained intubated for some time postoperatively when she was in the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory support.
It was felt that her prolonged weaning may have been secondary to the severity of her infection and it was not until postoperative day five the patient was actually taken off pressure support and changed over to CPAP although she did remain on CPAP for some time up until postoperative day eight when she again required some additional pressure support which she stayed on until postoperative day 11 at which time again she was converted back to CPAP.
Otherwise, she did have some small pleural effusions develop during the course of her hospitalization but the time of her discharge patient had no oxygen requirements, actually satting in the high 90's without any sort of oxygen support.
On examination there were only a few crackles at the bases indicating these had essentially resolved.
From a cardiac standpoint, there was a question of whether patient had suffered any sort of ischemic event while at the outside hospital as noted by troponin-I of 0.6 but there were no electrocardiogram changes and an echocardiogram there showed preserved left ventricular systolic function.
While she was hospitalized here she was again ruled out for any sort of myocardial infarction.
She never really had any episodes of oliguria or renal insufficiency.
The patient was relatively non-ambulatory but otherwise patient had no significant issues with renal dysfunction.
From a hematologic standpoint, patient did require blood transfusion on postoperative day two of two units given low hematocrit and her history of coronary artery disease.
She had always ranged between about 27 and 29 during her hospitalization except as noted when she came in when her hematocrit was between 30 and 33 which was felt partially to be secondary to dehydration.
Otherwise, she was on heparin subcu and Venodyne's for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis and there was never any evidence of deep venous thrombosis during the course of her hospitalization.
From the outside hospital their cultures were noted to grow Clostridium perphringens and Bacteroides fragilis.
These intraoperative cultures from our institution showed notable growth of Bacteroides fragilis, Gram positive rods, horny bacterium, Staphylococcus which was coag negative and Gram negative rods.
Given the extent of patient's infection and species as noted, patient's broad spectrum antibiotics including levofloxacin, Pen-G and clindamycin were carried on as per Infectious Disease recommendations.
Her Clostridium difficile's were negative and urine cultures never evidenced any sort of urinary tract infection.
In terms of management of her infected wound, initially after the debridement the wound was again cared for aggressively with dressing changes.
In terms of the patient's overall condition at the time of discharge, she had been afebrile and otherwise hemodynamically stable with sats in the high 90's on room air.
The wound looked good with good viable tissue and, therefore, it was felt that she could be discharged to an extended care rehabilitation facility for b.i.d.
FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was advised to return to her surgeon or call her surgeon's office for a temperature above 101.5 degrees, any worsening drainage from the wound or increasing redness of the wound.
