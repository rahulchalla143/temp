Upon admission, she then became hypotensive to systolic of 70s, so her dilt gtt was d/c'ed and she was bolused with saline.
Her course was complicated by demand ischemia with Trop I peak of 0.85 and ARF with creatinine peak of 2.08. .
She was found to have increasing LFTs with TB of 2.6, DB 2.1, alk phos 600 though no abdominal pain.
INR went from 2.1 to 6.5 on [**1-25**], which is now down to 1.35 after vitamin K. She had a RUQ ultrasound that showed gallbladder and CBD sludge v. stone v. mass and associated intra- and extrahepatic biliary tree dilatation.

Right inferior and superior minimally-displaced rami fractures of unknown chronicity, with evidence of healing.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.

A focal wall motion abnormality cannot be excluded.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, trace aortic regurgitation.
Improved biliary dilatation with residual hyupodense areas in the left lobe which are not well defined or delineated.
If clinically indicated, ultrasound could be considered since these could represent small fluid collections in the left lobe.

Brief Hospital Course: *** see attending d/c letter for attending note:  following is by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 18582**]  A/P:  Pt is a 75 yo female with history of CHF, COPD, DM2, schizophrenia who presented with E. coli sepsis, requiring vasopressors initially, transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP given increasing total bilirubin.
# Severe septic shock from VRE cholangitis/bacteremia:  The source of the vancomycin enterococcus bacteremia was likely biliary.
ERCP showed multiple stones, ranging in size from 8 mm to 15 mm, that were causing partial obstruction of the common bile duct.
There was also post-obstructive dilation with the CBD measuring 20mm and dilation of the intrahepatic biliary tree; the stone was not extracted on this occasion.
After her ERCP, she was become septic again, requiring levophed (which was switched to neo given SVT), and abx were broadened to vanc and meropenam.
The drain needed to be revised multiple times for biliary sludging.
She needed at 50 cc/day of biliary draining and climbed to 400 cc/day, likely representing obstruction of the drain.
Post-procedure, the patient had mild abdominal pain to palpation with a normal lipase.
# Acute renal failure leading to end-stage renal disease:  Pt developed anuric acute kidney injury, likely from acute tubular necrosis during hypotensive episodes due to sepsis.
Overall, her volume status has greatly improved.
There were initially signs of renal recovery, however, the patient still needs dialysis.
# Anasarca: The patient developed anasarca due to fluid boluses, acute exacerbation of diastolic heart failure, and poor PO intake.
She underwent dialysis for fluid removal.
She had significant LE edema which has resolved.
She continues to have upper extremity edema bilaterally.
She underwent an ultrasound of her right arm which was negative for DVT (she remained anticoagulated on heparin SC during her hospitalization) .
# Diabetes Mellitus Type II:  Pt was moderately controlled on insulin SS.
# Normocytic anemia: The patient developed a normocytic anemia while in the hospital.
She was pan-scanned to rule out any bleed and it showed no evidence of bleeding.
Her anemia was likely related to iron deficiency and bone marrow suppression in the face of multiple medical issues.
# Severe septic shock from E. coli urinary tract infection/bacteremia:  Pt was found to be in septic shock at OSH with E. coli in blood and urine.
# Diarrhea: The patient developed diarrhea while in the hospital.
Multiple C diff tests and stool cultures were negative.
Her diarrhea most likely relates to medication side effect vs. bacterial overgrowth.
# Atrial fibrillation/flutter: The patient was noted to have an episode of tachyarrhthmia on the morning of [**2189-1-29**] to 200s, which broke with carotid massage.
Levophed was changed to Neo In the evening, she had recurrent SVT initially to 200s, which came down to 150s with carotid massage.
At the time, adenosine showed underlying atrial flutter.
She received dilt x 2 without change and was thus started on amoidarone.
# Hypoactive delirium: The patient developed a hypoactive delirium while in the intensive care unit.
The initial etiologies were due to toxic/metabolic effects, use of sedatives during intubation and renal/hepatic failure.
A head CT was negative for intracranial bleed.
Her increased transaminases were likely due to cholangitis/liver congestion.
She was initially on rifaxamin and lactulose for treatment of hepatic encephalopaty (had elevated ammonia), but it was stopped.
With treatment of her underlying disease processes and orientation, the patient became more alert.
# Multifocal pneumonia: The patient was found to have a multifocal pneumonia with stable hemodynamics.
# Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: The patient was on high dose steroids during her stay in the ICU.
The patient was transferred to the floor and developed increasing respiratory distress on [**2-8**].
She was transferred to the ICU and started on high dose steroids and nebulizers for treatment of COPD exacerbation.
She was continued on albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers and had no signs of respiratory distress.
# Hypoxic and hypercapneic respiratory failure:  Pt was electively intubated for ERCP and remained intubated afterwards for somnolence.
She developed acute respiratory distress on [**2-8**] while on the medical floor.
She was transferred back to the floors without any respiratory distress.
She continues to be fluid overloaded, which likely causes increased shortness of breath.
#Pancytopenia: While on linezolid, the patient developed anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia.
The pancytopenia was likely multifactorial and related to linezolid, other medications and infection.
As the patient became more stable, her thrombocytopenia and leukopenia resolved.
# Schizophrenia: Abilify was initially held for her altered mental status and started once the patient's mental status became clear.
# Stage II sacral ulcer: Patient has a sacral ulcer.
# Vaginal/inguinal candiasis: The patient developed candiasis while on antibiotics.
#  Gastritis/peptic ulcer disease: On lansoprazole.
No signs of active bleeding or gastritis.
As an outpatient, might need anticoagulation with Coumadin for atrial fibrillation 2.
