NIHSS 	 Time of exam: 10:15am     Total score: 12 1a: Alert and responsive (0) 1b: Correct month, age (0) 1c: Follows simple commands (0) 2: Normal eye movements (0) 3: No visual loss (0) 4: right lower facial palsy (2) 5: left arm no drift x 10 seconds (0) 6: Right arm no movement (4) 7: Left leg no drift x 5 seconds (0)	 8: Right leg minimal movement, not antigravity (3) 9: No ataxia (hemiplegic) 10: Mild right sensory loss (1) 11: No aphasia (0) 12: Severe dysarthria (2) 13: No extinction (0)   Pertinent Results: CTA Head/Neck: 1.
Significant decreased mean transit time in the left perisylvian temporal lobe likely represents location of patient's recent infarction which is not well visualized on a non-contrast head CT study.
Of note, head CT can be insensitive method for evaluation of early infarction.
CTA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] is grossly normal; however, a question question is raised of obstruction of a small branch of the left middle cerebral artery at its trifurcation.
Severe spondylosis of the cervical spine as noted above with likely spinal cord compression, most prominent at the C6-C7 level.
Small low-attenuation lesion of left lobe of thyroid gland.
Carotid Dopplers: No stenosis bilaterally .
MRI/MRA Head: Diffusion images demonstrate an area of slow diffusion in the left subinsular region involving the left putamen and extending to corona radiata indicative of an acute left lenticulostriate territory infarct.
This infarct is in the distribution of delayed transit time and reduced blood flow on CT perfusion.
There is mild prominence of ventricles and sulci without midline shift or hydrocephalus.
A subtle area of increased signal in the medial right temporal lobe on diffusion images appears to be secondary to artifacts.
No evidence of hemorrhage or mass effect.
MRA OF THE HEAD: Head MRA demonstrates subtle decrease in the branches in the left sylvian region of middle cerebral artery.
IMPRESSION:  Subtle decrease in number of branches in the left sylvian region of the left middle cerebral artery.
No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic root is moderately dilated.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No cardiac source of embolism seen.
was observed in the ICU for 24 hours after TPA with no events.
MRI/MRA was performed and showed an acute infarct in the L lenticulostriate territory (See results above) which was consistent with his deficits.
His dysarthria and weakness improved over his hospital stay, although he still had significant dysarthria and 3-4/5 strength in his right arm and leg with an UMN pattern on day of discharge.
He was noted to have some episodes of paroxsymal A fib which responded to IV beta blocker, and then were well controlled with PO metoprolol.
Medications on Admission: Meclizine 25mg PRN Q6H Ranitidine 150mg [**Hospital1 **] Metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 1107**] [**Hospital **] Hospital - [**Location (un) 38**]  Discharge Diagnosis: L sided ischemic stroke (lenticulostriate territory) Paroxsymal atrial fibrillation   Discharge Condition: Stable- slurred speech improving but still present, R hemiparesis (3-4/5 strength)   Discharge Instructions: Please call your doctor or go to the ER if you develop any worsening in your speech, trouble swallowing, worsening weakness, or develop any new symptoms that concern you.
