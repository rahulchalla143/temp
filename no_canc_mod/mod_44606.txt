At that time, he had no fevers, chills, and denied pain or drainage from the site.
He denied any recent fever (highest temp 99F on Friday), chills, sweats, or pain or redness at site.
Further denies trauma in the area.
CXR showed no subcutaneous air and pacerleads looked intact.
On arrival to the floor, patient was afebrile and comfortable, VS were 98.2, 117/80, 86, 18, 100% RA.
He denies chest pain and shortness of breath.
CARDIAC HISTORY: *Premium ASD repair [**2159**] *MV repair [**2174**] *H/o Afib *MVR and Maze in [**1-/2184**] c/b CHB s/p PPM with pacemaker induced CM s/p *BiV ICD upgrade (EP-Hx: [**2184-2-18**] PPM placement for CHB post MVR; [**2184-10-29**] Upgrade to BiV ICD afer noted to have CM (EF 45--->17%); [**2188-4-8**], Generator change, RV PPM and Fidelis Lead extraction)complicated by a hematoma .
Moderate cardiomegaly, status post valvular replacement.
No acute changes, notably no pulmonary edema, no pneumonia.
No pleural effusions.
TTE ([**2190-4-6**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to inferior and posterior akinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
At least moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
No valvular or wire-associated vegetation seen.
TEE ([**2190-4-8**]): No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No mass or thrombus is seen in the right atrium or right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid anteroseptal wall.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %).
Right ventricular cavity size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
A mild paravalvular mitral prosthesis leak is probably present.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the ICD/pacemaker leads in the right atrium and right ventricle.
There is no pericardial effusion.
There is mild cardiomegaly.
Brief Hospital Course: Patient is a 33yo M w/ PMHx of congenital heart defect, s/p ASD repair at age 2, MVR, pacemaker induced cariomyopathy, s/p ICD placement who presents with an infected, eroded, exposed [**Month/Day/Year **] lead, s/p hardware removal and reimplantation.
ACTIVE PROBLEMS: # [**Name2 (NI) 19721**] lead infection: Upon presentation, the patient was afebrile with [**Name2 (NI) **] leads exposed in the left upper aspected of the chest with no surrounding erythema, palpable fluctuance, or purulence.
TTE did not show evidence of valvular vegetations given the concern of wire-associated endocarditis.
His [**Year (4 digits) **] pocket was closed by plastic surgery on [**2190-4-13**] without complication.
- He should followup with device clinic this week for interrogation and to have stitches removed.
