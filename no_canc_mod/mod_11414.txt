Admission Date:  [**2173-10-8**]     Discharge Date:  [**2173-10-21**]  Date of Birth:   [**2138-7-9**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Surgery, Purple Team HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 35-year-old male referred for evaluation of gastric restrictive surgery for morbid obesity.
pounds, a height of 70.25 inches, and a body mass index of 42.5.
Previous weight loss efforts included Neutra System, Slim-Fast, and three months of [**Doctor Last Name 1729**] diet which had limited effectiveness.
Degenerative joint disease.
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  His medication regimen included Soma for back pain and glucosamine for joints.
ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On examination, the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure of 122/76 and pulse was 95.
There was no cervical adenopathy, thyromegaly, or carotid bruits.
The patient had a regular rate and rhythm without any murmurs or rubs on cardiovascular examination.
The abdomen was obese but soft and nontender.
The extremities were without cyanosis, clubbing, edema, venous insufficiency, or evidence of joint swelling or inflammation.
The patient's postoperative course was complicated by poor urine output requiring multiple boluses of fluid as well as poor pain control.
On postoperative day three, out of concern for potential leakage due to the patient's continued fluid requirement and pain, a swallow study was obtained to evaluate the jejunostomy anastomosis.
The swallow study was read as normal with no evidence of spillage of contrast, and the contrast flowed normally in the jejunal loops.
On [**2173-10-11**], which was postoperative day three, because of continued fluid requirements and increasing pain, the patient was taken for another upper gastrointestinal study indicating air contrast levels and dilated loops of small bowel; suggestive of postoperative ileus with an unusual contour of contrast in the low-mid abdomen and large free spillage of contrast in the abdomen at the level of the proximal gastrojejunal anastomosis.
A methylene blue study was done on [**2173-10-15**] to check for evidence of continued leak.
He was advanced to a stage II diet on [**2173-10-16**] due to the negative study with the methylene blue.
This result indicated that in fact there was still a persistent leak at the gastrojejunostomy.
The CT results indicated a patent gastric remnant without any evidence of extravasation or obstruction.
There was a large collection in the left upper quadrant that was tapped and appeared to be consistent with old hematoma.
The patient was started on gastrostomy tube feeds then; receiving the normal four ounces three times per day of a Carnation Instant Breakfast that he would be receiving with his stage III gastric bypass diet.
He was also given fluid boluses for a total fluid intake of around 1600 cc per day.
The patient had had continued spiking temperatures; however, it was felt by the surgical team to be most likely due to an abscess discovered by CT in his left upper quadrant; probably secondary to extravasation of gastric contents.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:   Open gastric bypass; complicated by gastrojejunostomy leak, complicated by intra-abdominal abscess formation.
