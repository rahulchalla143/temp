Underwent L TKR ([**Date range (1) 39099**]) for osteoarthritis at NEBH.
Postoperatively, required hospitalization ([**Date range (1) 36015**]) at NEBH for dyspnea/hypoxia attributed to pneumonia and was treated with 10 day course of ceftriaxone/azithromycin.
Over the last 2-3 days, has had worsening dyspnea with exertion and productive cough c whitish-clear sputum.
developed significant dyspnea while walking to bathroom and ambulance called.
CTA chest done to exclude PE (no PE noted).

Family History: Brother died of complications [**1-18**] COPD in 70s  Physical Exam: VS- 98.1, 86, 145/79, 95% NRB, RR 20-30 GEN- Elderly man appears fatigued with NRB over face, able to have conversation HEENT- no elevation of JVP, anicteric sclerae, dry MM LUNGS- scattered crackles b/l lung fields HEART- RRR, S1, S2, + [**3-23**] SM c/w MR [**Last Name (Titles) **]- soft, ND, NT, BS+ EXTRE- wwp, no edema.
10 cm linear scar over midline L knee, well healed.
Mixed changes since prior study, with several areas of improved ground- glass opacity seen bilaterally, unchanged donsolidative opacity in the left lower lobe, and increased consolidation in right lower lobe.
Findings are most suggestive of an acute infection superimposed on a chronic interstitial fibrotic lung disease.
In the absence of infectious symptoms, acute exacerbation of chronic interstitial pneumonia should also be considered especially if the patient has experienced worsening dyspnea in the past month without other contributing factors.
The underlying nature of patient's chronic interstitial fibrotic lung disease is difficult to assess in the setting of acute superimposed changes.
Given the bronchovascular involvement and hyperlucent nodules, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis should be considered.
Other diagnostic considerations include usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP) and a fibrotic sybtype of nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP).
Findings suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension .
CT head [**4-25**] No CT evidence for acute intracranial process.
No pulmonary embolism to proximal subsegmental level.
This could represent pneumonia, especially with superimposed dense consolidation and effusion at the left base.
The peripheral interstitial opacity better seen in the right lung could also represent an interstitial process such as UIP/IPF.
Small left pleural effusion.
Coronary artery calcifications.
ECHO The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion..   Brief Hospital Course: 78 man with history of bronchiectasis, recent left knee replacement and treatment for community acquired pneumonia presents with hypoxic respiratory failure.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Initially concerns included healthcare acquired pneumonia given his recent bout with pneumonia one week ago (treatedw ith ceftriaxone and azithro, unclear if his symptoms really subsided), PE given his recent knee surgery.
A chest CTA was done in the ED that did not show PE but did show some fibrotic process.
He had a CXR in the ED that showed LLL consolidation and treatment for healthcare acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn were started.
His increasing oxygen requirement was concerning and he was intubated.
Initially there was some concern for acute on chronic congestive heart failure as a cause of his respiratory distress, diuresis did not improve his symptoms, BNP was not elevated and echo was unimpressive.
In addition he had a bronchoscopy and BAL, from which no organsisms were isolated.
A repeat CT chest was done for concern of the fibrotic changes on his inital CT.
The diagnosis of acute IPF was considered likely as he had not improved on antibiotics.
NAC was also started without effect.
# ARF:  Pt had a hypotensive episode on [**4-23**], which likely led to pre-renal/ATN.
# Hypernatremia:  Two days after initiating tube feeds his serum sodium became elevated, likely secondary to decreased free water intake, improved with increased free water boluses.
There is no evidence for PE on CTA.
# Gout held colchicine secondary to ARF .
