Admission Date: [**2193-8-26**]        Discharge Date: [**2193-11-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2193-8-26**]        Sex:  M  Service:  Neonatology  IDENTIFICATION:  [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 4469**] is a 71 day old former 26 [**5-6**] wk premature twin, now 37 wks corrected, with a history of mild chronic lung disease and ileal perforation s/p ileostomy who is being transferred from [**Hospital1 18**] NICU to [**Hospital **] Hospital SCN.
This pregnancy was a diamniotic-dichorionic pregnancy achieved with in-[**Last Name (un) 5153**] fertilization and donor eggs.
Pregnancy was complicated by preterm labor treated with bed rest at 24 weeks gestation.
Rupture of membranes occurred two weeks prior to delivery, leading to treatment with magnesium sulfate.
Her previous medical history of anxiety and depression was treated with Prozac and Klonopin.
Maternal temperature of 102.6 prompted cesarean delivery for chorioamnionitis and vertex-transverse lie.
Mother's amniotic fluid culture did grow out Staphylococcus epidermidis and the mother was treated with 14 days of antibiotics for Staphylococcal epidermidis bacteremia.
Admission physical exam revealed an extremely premature infant.
No sacral anomalies.
Course over first 48 hours of life was complicated by pulmonary hemorrhage in context of a PDA and a pneumomediastinum.
The pneumomediastinum resolved spontaneously without intervention.
Since that time, he has remained in room air without significant respiratory distress.
The infant was started on caffeine citrate for apnea and bradycardia of prematurity while at [**Hospital3 1810**] and remained on it until day of life 52, which was corrected gestational age of 34-2/7 weeks.
Since that time, he has had no significant apnea/bradycardia episodes, but does have an occasional drift in his oxygen saturation primarily associated with PO feedings.
Cardiovascular:  The infant initially did not require pressor support during the first several days of life, but was noted to develop a murmur consistent with a patent ductus arteriosus at the time of presentation with pulmonary hemorrhage.
Just prior to his PDA ligation, he did require several boluses of sodium bicarbonate for persistent metabolic acidosis.
Thoracotomay incision is healing well.
FEN/GI:  On day of life 9, the infant was noted to have an acute decompensation, with marked duskiness of the abdomen.
Babygram revealed free air.
Baby was transferred to the [**Hospital3 1810**] and was found to have two isolated terminal ileum perforations.
GU:  Baby was noted to have a blue scrotum.
He had an abdominal ultrasound on [**8-31**], which showed bilateral hydroceles, but otherwise normal.
Infectious disease:  Upon admission to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit because of concern for chorioamnionitis and extreme prematurity and respiratory distress, the baby had a blood culture and a CBC sent.
Baby had another sepsis evaluation on [**9-29**], day of life 34 with a temperature spike of 100.3.
He has had no further issues with infection during this hospitalization.
ORL:  Over the last several weeks of hospitalization, the infant was noted to have a hoarse cry prompting an ORL evaluation, which noted a paralyzed left vocal cord.
No intervention was necessary, and the plan is follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of ORL at [**Hospital3 1810**] in [**1-2**] months, telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 48318**].
Neurology:  Baby has had serial head ultrasounds performed, the last one being on [**10-19**], which was day of life 54 and they have been within normal limits.
No evidence of intraventricular hemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia has been seen.
Born between 32 and 35 weeks with two of the following: daycare during the RSV season, a smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities, or school-age siblings, or 3.
With chronic lung disease.
Before this age and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out of home caregivers.
Status post respiratory distress syndrome.
Status post pulmonary hemorrhage.
Left vocal cord paralysis.
