Admission Date:  [**2195-6-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2195-7-7**]   Service:  [**Hospital1 **] HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84 year-old female with a history of CREST, diverticular disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and prior upper GI bleed in [**7-19**] secondary to AVM and gastritis.
Her previous UGIB required hospitalization, which was notable for a hematocrit of 16 on during stay, 2 units of fresh frozen platelets, esophagogastroduodenoscopy showing gastritis and normal duodenum, cauterization of a gastric AVM, and angiography followed by embolization of left gastric artery.
She presented to the Emergency Room at this time with a chief complaint of two days of dark stools, left lower abdominal breath, lightheadedness, fevers or chills, and night sweats.
No bright red blood per rectum, no hematemesis.
In the Emergency Room she was found to be in no acute distress and with a temperature of 99.5, blood pressure 143/53, pulse 86, respirations 16, 98% on room air.
Sjogren's with Sicca syndrome CREST with a history of dysphagia and dyspepsia (followed by gastroenterologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1940**]).
Irritable bowel syndrome with chronic diarrhea, constipation and abdominal pain.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with bronchiectasis, right bronchial sclerosis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General, thin elderly woman in no acute distress.
No scleral icterus.
No lower dentition.
No gallops or rubs.
No tenderness to palpation.
Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
2+ radial and dorsalis pedis pulses.
No asterixics.
Urinalysis negative.
No acute ischemic changes.
Gastrointestinal:  The patient presented with an upper gastrointestinal bleed with a hematocrit of 29.9, melena left lower quadrant pain and coffee grounds with red tinge on nasogastric lavage.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done on [**6-18**], which showed diffuse gastritis and a normal duodenum consistent with what was seen during admission a year before.
On [**6-25**], enteroscopy showed improved gastritis and a normal duodenum and jejunum.
Colonoscopy on [**6-29**] showed retained melena and multiple nonbleeding diverticula, but no source of bleeding.
A tagged red cell scan on [**6-23**] did not identify a source of gastrointestinal bleeding either.
and Carafate, but she had continuous gastrointestinal bleed as manifested by guaiac positive stools, both melena and bloody stool and unstable hematocrit throughout most of her stay.
On the evening of [**7-1**] (hospital day fifteen), the patient had a dramatic gastric bleed with a hematocrit drop from 27.7 to 17.4.
Nasogastric lavage at this point revealed bright red blood with clots that did not clear with 420 cc of H20.
By hospital day seventeen, the patient decided that she wanted no more blood product transfusions and wanted CMO.
However, one day after the transfer, her hematocrit dropped to 24.1 with bloody diarrhea.
The patient reexpressed her wishes for CMO and did not want any more laboratory tests or any blood product transfusions.
It appeared that gastrointestinal bleeding either slowed or stopped, so after discussion between the patient and the family and a hematocrit check was done, which at the value of 26.4 showed that she had stopped bleeding.
Two of five studies (epinephrine and arachidonic acid) for platelet aggregation were abnormal so she was given Desmopressin intravenous times two doses ([**6-24**] and [**6-27**]) and one bag of platelets, which did not help stabilize her hematocrit.
A total of 5 units of fresh frozen platelets were also given, because of multiple red blood cells could have diluted the concentration of her clotting factors and less likely, because of the possibility that she had a coagulopathy given one PTT value.
Hematology/oncology consult did not feel that the patient had platelet aggregation abnormalities or a coagulopathy.
At this time she also developed a urinary tract infection, so the tachycardia was thought to be secondary to infection or dehydration.
When it rose again to 120 to 130s or the patient was symptomatic with palpitations, administration of normal saline intravenous helped control the tachycardia.
After the precipitous hematocrit drop on hospital day fifteen, the patient's cardiac enzymes were checked and they revealed a mild enzyme leak with CK 118 and 128, MB 8 and 9 and troponin 0.9.
The patient was also found to have 3 out of 6 systolic murmur loudest at right upper sternal border, radiating to subclavian arteries.
Pulmonary:  During the MICU stay, where she was given 6 units of packed red blood cells and 2 units of fresh frozen platelets she developed dyspnea and bilateral pleural effusion.
Infectious disease:  On hospital day five the patient spiked a temperature to 101.5.
During the MICU stay her white blood cells spiked to 19.9, but she was afebrile and there was no clear source of infection (no pneumonia on chest x-ray, negative urine culture).
As it is a cholinergic agonist it could have led to increased gastric motility and dampen CVA response to hypotension.
The patient will be discharged to rehab with clear instructions on how she would like to be cared for if she were to present with recurrent gastrointestinal bleed.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to gastritis.
