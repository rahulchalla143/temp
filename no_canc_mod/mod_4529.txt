Non-distended, and soft without tenderness EXTREMITIES: right foot-charcot with 1+ edema, ulcer of 3cm diameter, fluctuance of tissue, erythema and warm.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The lung bases demonstrate minimal dependent atelectasis.
There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.
No focal lesion in the liver on this noncontrast study.
Prominence of the common bile duct is again noted which is likely related to post-cholecystectomy status.
Non- contrast evaluation of the spleen demonstrates no focal lesion with size in the range of normal The pancreas and left adrenal gland appear normal.
There may be mild nodular thickening of the right adrenal gland though imaging is quite limited through this region.
The kidneys appear normal in size and are without evidence for stones or hydronephrosis.

FOOT AP/LAT/OBLIQUE FINDINGS: There has been interval progression of the Charcot arthropathy with increase in the heterotopic bone formation, osteopenia, and destructive erosive changes around the joints.
The subluxation of second through fifth metatarsal bone are consistent with chronic Lisfranc deformity.
There is plantar soft tissue swelling along the midfoot with defect in the skin compatible with known ulcer.
Soft tissue prominence with skin ulceration along the plantar surface of the midfoot.
No definite evidence of osteomyelitis.

No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Aortic valve sclerosis.
Cardiac Catheterization [**2155-4-11**]: PTCA COMMENTS:     The initial angiography revealed a 70% mid LAD lesion and an 80% proximal LCX lesion.
The strategy was to predilate and stent both focal lesions with bare metal stents.
Bivalirudin was administered for anticoagulation.
Prowater wire crossed both of the lesions easily.
The LAD lesion was predilated with a 2.5 X 12 mm Voyager at 8 atms and stented with a 2.5 X 15 mm Vision stent deployed at 18 atms with no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow.
2.5 X 12 mm Voyager was used to predilate the lesion at 6 atms and a 3.0 X 15 Vision stent was deployed at 16 atms with no residual stenosis.
the patient experienced a brief episode of hypotension that responded to atropine and IV fluids after LCX stent deployment.
The final angiography showed TIMI III flow and no dissection or perforation in either vessel.
The left arteriotomy site was closed with a Mynx device given patient's severe chronic back pain.
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed 2 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent flow limiting epicardial coronary artery disease.
The RCA had mild irregularities.
Resting hemodynamics revealed severe systemic arterial systolic hypertension with SBP 195 mmHg.
Successful stenting of the mid LAD with a 2.5 X 15 mm Vision bare metal stent with no residual stenosis (see PTCA comments for detail).
Successful stenting of the proximal LCX with a 3.0 X 15 mm Vision bare metal stent with no residual stenosis (see PTCA comments for detail).
Successful closure of the left femoral arteriotomy with a Mynx device.
Severe systemic arterial systolic hypertension.
MRI FOOT: MRI OF THE RIGHT FOOT FINDINGS: Comparison with the previous MR from [**2151-8-27**] shows increased fragmentation and disorganization of the mid and forefoot.
A large soft tissue defect is identified along the plantar surface of the foot (series 2, image 16).
A sinus tract is seen to extend from this skin defect (series 15, image 27) and extends approximately to the plantar surface of the neoarthrosis where it communicates with a fluid collection (series 15, image 32).
This fluid collection measures 17 mm in transverse x 6 mm in craniocaudal x 2.3 cm in AP dimension.
There is rim enhancement and this collection is consistent with an abscess.
No evidence of any significant signal intensity abnormality in relation to the bones.
Some abnormal signal intensity is noted in relation to the tibial-calcaneal articulation with the navicular consistent with the Charcot joint.
Diffuse edema is noted in the subcutaneous tissues of the plantar aspect of the foot.
This may be concerning for progression to osteomyelitis at a later stage.
Sinus tract extending from skin at soft tissue defect in plantar aspect of the foot to plantar surface of neoarthrosis of tibia fused to calcaneus.
Sinus tract extends to 2.3 cm collection inferior to neoarthrosis.
Increased fragmentation and disorganization of mid foot and forefoot since previous study.
No definite evidence of osteomyelitis but a soft tissue defect and abscess extend to plantar surface of neoarthrosis and is concerning for progression to osteomyelitis.
She developed fevers to 102.7 associated with nausea and vomiting and was admitted.
Patient was found to be bacteremic with staph aureus [**1-31**] culture bottles consistent with wound cultures from Right Charcot foot.
Hypoxia / Pulmonary Edema: The patient was admitted initially to the medical intensive care unit for concern for sepsis, and was transfused 2 units of packed red cells and given 3L of IVF in the emergency department.
After arrival to the MICU, the patient became acutely dyspneic.
ECG showed tachycardia with exaggeration of lateral and interior ST depressions, and CXR had fluffy bilateral infiltrates.
Felt she had acute diastolic heart failure and flash pulmonary edema, and she was diuresed with good effect.
She did have a transient elevation in her CK to 175 with troponin leak to 0.14.
Cardiac/CAD:She developed 7/10 chest pain, and she was given SL NTG for CP Pt with exaggeration of pre-existing ECG changes, suggestive of ischemia.
Did have troponin leak of 0.14 and clinical picture was felt to be consistent with NSTEMI.
Underwent cardiac catheterization notable for LAD with 40% proximal and a 70% mid stenosis.
The RCA had mild irregularities.
Underwent stenting of the mid LAD with a 2.5 X 15 mm bare metal stent and proximal LCX with a 3.0 X 15 mm bare metal stent with no residual stenosis.
Patient remained chest pain free post procedure.
DM: Labile finger sticks with both hypoglycemic episodes and hyperglycemia requiring short term insulin gtt while in unit.
Upon transfer to the floor, patient had symptomatic hypoglycemia with FS in 40s.
Anemia: Borderline microcytic anemia (MCV 84) with inappropriate marrow response.
Received 2U PRBCS but no evidence of active bleeding.
Petechiae: Noted on exam raising concern for [**Doctor Last Name **] but lab studies revealed elevated fibrinogen as well as elevated Ddimer.
This was felt to be due to nutritional deficiency.
HTN: patient had elevated blood pressures despite increasing medical regimen.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital1 700**] - [**Location (un) 701**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction C. difficile colitis Methicillin- sensitive S. aureus bacteremia/deep wound infection Acute diastolic heart failure  Secondary: Diabetes mellitus Chronic kidney disease   Discharge Condition: Good, vital signs stable, afebrile, chest pain free   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital with a foot infection that spread to the blood.
You also had an infection in your gut called C. difficile colitis.
You will need to continue antibiotics for several weeks.
You also had a heart attack and had a stent placed in your coronary artery to open up the blockage.
Please contact your doctor or return to the emergency room if you develop worrisome symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, chills, etc.
