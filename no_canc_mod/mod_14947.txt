Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Aortic Valve replacement (27mm Tissue) [**2162-1-22**] left heart catheterization, coronary angiography   History of Present Illness: This 60 year old male with ESRD on HD (MWF), and known bicuspid aortic valve with AS (1.0 [**Location (un) 109**]) presented to [**Location (un) **] with paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
The patient reports that 1 week prior, after "skidooing", he became acutely short of breath and feeling his heart pounding.
EMS was called and they gave him O2 and monitored his VS. with resolution of his symptoms.
The day prior to admission, after dialysis, the patient reports that prior to dinner he had substernal burning sensation with some radiation into the right shoulder.
The pain was [**10-2**] and lasted 4 hours.
It was not associated with excertion and simialar to his prior heart-burn.
The pain resolved on its own and he was able to eat dinner.
He then went to sleep and awoke several hours later acutely SOB and again gasping for air.
He was tachycardiac in the ED and thought to either be in sinus tach vs V-tach.
It was thought he most likely has sinus tachycardia with a left bundle branch.
He was  also given levofloxacin 250mg IV x1 for possible RLL pneumonia.
On the floor he was  chest pain free, breathing comfortably without any complaints.
He reports SOB with walking short distances (down the [**Doctor Last Name **]).
No orthopnea, lower extremety edema.

Left bundle-branch block.
Hyperinflation consistent with chronic lung disease.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Interstitial pulmonary edema.
Probable right lower lobe pneumonia.
Bilaterally small kidneys consistent with chronic renal disease  Cath [**1-18**] COMMENTS: 1.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed single vessel branch CAD with diffuse atherosclerosis.
The LMCA had mild distal tapering.
The LAD was heavily calcified with a tubular 35% stenosis in the mid vessel; the D1 origin had a 70% stenosis.
The RCA had a 30% mid vessel stenosis.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 10 mm Hg.
Left sided filling pressures were severely elevated with LVEDP of 37 mm Hg.
Moderate to severe pulmonary arterial hypertension was present; mean PCWP was elevated at 30 mm Hg.
20-30 mm pulsus alternans was present after crossing with a double lumen pigtail catheter in to the left ventricle.
Single vessel branch CAD with diffuse atherosclerosis.
Moderate-severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Moderate to severe aortic stenosis; calculated [**Location (un) 109**] underestimated in setting of know 3+ AI and cannot be accurately computed using estimated O2 consumption due to need for supplemental O2.
Calcified peripheral arterial atherosclerosis.
Pulsus alternans consistent with aortic regurgitation and/or LV systolic dysfunction.
No evidence of intracardiac shunting.
TTE [**1-19**] The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**12-25**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic stenosis.
Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.
Low-normal left ventricular systolic function.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Moderate aortic root dilation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-1-23**], left ventricular systolic function is mildly reduced, the left ventricular cavity size is larger and the severity of aortic stenosis has progressed.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient has a history of hepatitis C and therefore was evaluated and cleared by hepatology prior to surgery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
The patient was dialyzed according to the recommendations of the renal service.
By the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for pain for 4 weeks.
