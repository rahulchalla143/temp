She was at her group home when she began having right sided facial twitching, which progressed to right arm flexion with unresponsiveness, which typically lasted one minute.
She was given Valium, Dilantin 200 mg intravenous, Phenobarbital 60 mg and Kepra 500 mg with Ativan 2 mg intravenous and vago nerve stimulator was used without resolution of seizures.
Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone for an aspiration pneumonia three days prior to presentation and she continued to have copious output from her trach tube.
Her significant history includes left sided partial hemispherectomy, which resulted in a right sided hemiplegia and inability to speak, but comprehension appears intact.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No seizures.
In general, the patient is a young woman in no acute distress, but continuously seizing.
Mental status, awake, nonverbal, but between seizures she is able to follow commands, but cannot attend for any length of time.
CT scan revealed no acute hemorrhage.
She also had low blood pressures in the setting of a fever, which was concerning for septicemia.
Phenobarbital levels were kept in the low to mid 30s while phenytoin was kept in the low to mid 20s without any clinical signs or symptoms of overdose.
Three or four days subsequently she developed facial twitches, which is consistent with epilepsia partialis continua and therefore her medications were adjusted accordingly.
Although she continues to have some facial twitching these do not bother her and they are of decreased frequency.
She has done well from a neurological perspective.
With regard to her pneumonia and need for frequent suctioning, this has significantly improved during the course of this hospitalization.
We note that Ms. [**Known lastname **] has a very small tracheostomy tube and we have been informed by her interventional pulmonologist that this tube should not be decannulated outside of a medical Intensive Care Unit.
