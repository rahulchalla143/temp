She arose from her fall and went to lay down in bed - apparently responsive and alert at the time.
She was transferred to an outside hospital ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 18488**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) where she underwent a computer tomography scan showing a substantial parafalcine subdural hemorrhage predominantly in the left with some small contusions in the frontoparietal area.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Upon examination at the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital, she was moving her left extremely and localizing to stimulation, had some minimal movement of her right extremity.
A repeat computer tomography scan was done showing blossoming of the left frontoparietal contusion with a stable subdural.
She was noted to have a right humeral fracture as well.
She had some increased swelling over the contusion.
Given her poor prognosis and unlikely recovery, she was made comfort measures only.
