Excavated Lesions A few non-bleeding patchy erosions were noted in the hiatal hernia.

# Acute blood loss anemia/Upper GI bleed - Nasogastric Lavage in ED confirmed coffee ground material without bright red blood.
On HD#2, Mr. [**Known lastname 28942**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] an endoscopy which showed erythema in the distal esophagus, a large hiatal hernia and erosions in the hiatal hernia.
On the floor, Mr. [**Known lastname 35544**] hematocrit remained stable and his diet was advanced to regular without difficulty.
# Abdominal  pain - Patient presented with epigastric pain.
His pain was treated with morphine as needed and resolved spontaneously.
# Anemia, iron deficiency - Pt with microcytic hypochromic anemia with elevated RDW (17).
This could be compatible with chronic small bleeding causing iron deficiency.
Furthermore, dietary deficiency cannot be excluded as well as acute bleeding.
The high RDW suggest iron deficiency with contomitant B12/folate deficiencies or reticylocytosis.
Iron studies showed a ferritin of 9.2, consistent with severe iron deficiency.
# Hyperglycemia - Pt with hyperglycemia on admission labs.
# PPx - pneumoboots, colace/senna, with morphine intravenously for pain control.
Senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
