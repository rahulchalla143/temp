The patient also the patient with poor effort.
The patient also complained of "paralysis."
Apparently, the patient lost function of his MRI revealed white matter changes in the frontal lobe at [**Hospital 48910**] Hospital.
Occasional diffuse abdominal pain.
The patient denies headache or chest pain.
The patient complains of being very thirsty.
The patient has a longstanding psychiatry history labeled as psychotic depression, schizoaffective disorder, with a long history of resistance and refusal of medical care.
The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital3 **] Home on [**9-16**], but since arrival had refused to eat or take medications.
MRI of the head at [**Hospital 48910**] Hospital revealed small vessel disease and white matter changes predominantly in the front lobe.
Depression with psychotic features.
Questionable parkinsonian feature; it was thought that perhaps patient's neurodegenerative disease may be related to antipsychotic medication.
Stage I decubitus ulcer in coccyx.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
No cervical lymphadenopathy.
Chest was a poor anterior examination, positive rhonchi anteriorly.
Abdomen had hypoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, and nondistended, scaphoid.
Rigid upper extremity and lower extremity, would not spontaneously move upper or lower extremities.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  X-ray revealed left retrocardiac opacity suggestive of aspiration pneumonia.
Electrocardiogram revealed Q waves inferiorly, T wave inversions in II, III, aVF, V3 through V6.
ST elevations in V2 of 2 mm, poor R wave progression.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   In summary, this is a 65-year-old male with psychotic depression and schizoaffective disorder, who presented with decreased oral intake and aspiration pneumonia.
The patient had intermittent episodes of desaturations to the 70% and 80%.
These desaturations were thought to be due to aspirations because they resolved with aggressive suctioning.
Partial parenteral nutrition was considered; however, it would not contribute to the patient's comfort and would only provide at the maximum of 25% of the patient's daily needs.
Since the patient was refusing laboratory draws, it was also thought unwise to start partial parenteral nutrition without being able to monitor the patient for refeeding syndrome.
The patient was evaluated by anesthesia who felt that the patient could not undergo electroconvulsive therapy without being intubated.
The patient has been refusing further workup of his neurodegenerative disease.
The end result was that the patient died in the hospital, due to inanition and respiratory failure.
