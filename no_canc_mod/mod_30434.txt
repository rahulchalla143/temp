Immediately post exercise the patient was noted to have diffuse pulmonary wheezing.
EKG did not reveal evidence of ischemia with stress.
Imaging was notable for an inferior lateral perfusion defect that was moderately reversible.
[**2106-2-2**] echo: Mild concentric LVH with an LVEF of 50-55%.
Moderate MR, moderate AI, mild TR, mild pulmonary hypertension.
[**2106-2-8**] carotid u/s: no significant disease noted.
[**2106-2-8**] ABI's: moderate to severe stenosis of the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries bilaterally.
Echo [**2106-3-10**]:PRE-CPB: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild to moderate ([**1-18**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is slight retraction of both mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate (2+) central mitral regurgitation is seen with systolic blood pressures of around 150 mmHg.
At lower SBP (around 110) the MR is mild to moderate.
Valvular abnormalities noted in pre-CPB study remain.
CXR [**3-17**]: No CHF with stable left pleural effusion.
He experienced bouts of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which was treated with Amiodarone.
On postoperative day five, he displayed new onset paranoia with visual hallucinations.
The timing of his symptoms did raise the possibility of adverse reaction to Percocet.
Because of some mild sternal drainage, he was empirically placed on antibiotics.
