They attempted to give a 500 cc bolus but her last peripheral IV stopped working.
She is complaining of severe abdominal and back pain which she states has been going on since yesterday.
In terms of recent history, she was admitted to [**Hospital 28448**] Center on [**6-17**] with SOB and cough.
They felt she had a COPD exacerbation and treated her with steroids, bronchodilators, and azithromycin.
On [**6-20**], she became acutely SOB and CXR showed LUL infiltrate.
She was begun on zosyn and cipro for possible pseudomonal pna (as had reportedly grown this in past).
Swallow study was negative for aspiration.
Per their notes her SOB and cough were much improved.
Renal ultrasound showed R kidney 10.2 cm w/mult cysts, left normal, no hydro.
CAD s/p CABGX5 [**2165**] 5.
HTN 10.
Hyperlipidemia 11. s/p AVR [**2165**] 12.
Esophageal stricture s/p dilatation x2 [**85**].

Severe diffuse tracheobronchomalacia.
Cylindrical bronchiectasis, predominantly basal, and scattered nodular ground-glass opacities suggest chronic and ongoing aspiration.
Small bilateral pleural effusion.
Moderate size hiatus hernia.
Large right pelvic side wall hematoma measuring 11.7 x 9.1 cm, with extension into the right rectus muscle.
There is no evidence of  intraperitoneal extension of hemorrhage.
The possibility of active extravasation is not optimally assessed without intravenous contrast.
There are again seen scattered areas of ill-defined ground glass opacity and bronchiectatic changes within the lungs bilaterally, which are not significantly changed in comparison to most recent study from two days prior.
Echo [**2176-7-2**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
A mid-cavitary gradient is identified, consistent with mild flow obstruction at rest.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with hyperdynamic systolic function, and no regional wall motion abnormalities.
Mild resting mid-cavitary flow obstruction.
LENI [**2176-7-5**] CONCLUSION:  No evidence of DVT.
Newly inserted two right central lines with no evidence of complications.
Small new right pleural effusion.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 yo woman with tracheobronchomalacia, on heparin gtt for [**Hospital 64315**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from an OSH for IP evaluation and possible Y stent who was transferred to the MICU for hypotension, decreased Hct in the setting of retroperitoneal bleed.
Retroperitoneal Bleed - Pt had bleed and was hypovolemic in setting of blood loss while supratherpeutic on heparin.
On CT scan, she was found to have a large right pelvic side wall hematoma with extension into the right rectus muscle.
There was no evidence of intraperitoneal extension of hemorrhage.
Although her Hct stabilized, when we attempted to start anticoagulation with warfarin again at low doses, she subsequently developed a decreasing hematocrit which required further transfusions of FFP and Hct.
We reversed this INR with Vit K.  We decided that she was currently not a candidate for anticoagulation in the setting of her acute bleed and in the setting of increasing bleeds to even low levels of anticoagulation.
She tolerated two additional dialysis sessions without incident.
Elevated WBC count - She was hypothermic and met criteria for SIRS but this is all likely explained by hypovolemic shock.
She ultimately had a gram stain positive for gram positive cocci in her sputum (culture negative to date [**7-13**]), from [**2176-7-10**].
She also had erythema on her right lower extremity.
This was thought to be more consistent with venous stasis changes than cellulitis and did not change when vancomycin was started.
ischemia - no evidence of active ischemia.
she had one episode of transient right-sided chest pain.
Diabetes mellitus - She was treated with an insulin sliding scale while in the hospital to maintain glucoses <120.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Discharge Diagnosis: Retroperitoneal hematoma   Discharge Condition: -Good   Discharge Instructions: Please call if become dizzy, weak, temp >101, chills, abdominal pain or abnormal bruising.
