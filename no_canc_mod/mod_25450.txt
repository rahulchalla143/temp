Upon admission the JP drain placed after surgery noted to have bright red blood as well as patients clothing and bedclothes.
Due to the appearance of BRB and transfusion requirement, there was great concern for intra-abdominal bleeding and the patient was taken to the OR on day of admission for exploratory laparoscopy with washout and drain replacement.
At the time of surgery, there was a significant amount of blood in the abdomen and this was washed out.
Inspection of the hilum and the gallbladder fossa did not show active bleeding.
There was no active bleeding at the time so the abdomen was closed.
The following day she underwent percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram which showed: - High-grade obstruction of the distal common bile duct.
- No evidence for bile leak.
- Variant anatomy with the right anterior duct draining into the left hepatic duct and inferior insertion of the right posterior bile duct to the common hepatic duct.
- Mild-moderate narrowing at the confluence of the variantly inserting right posterior duct, which may be due to edema and/or partial compression from nearby clips.
She was also noted to have worsening pleural effusions and was started on Lasix.
On POD 5 she was noted to have increasing delirium.
With correction of the metabolic disturbances and continuation of antibiotics she appeared to return to baseline.
She does have some residual left sided weakness and neuro was satisfied with her return to previous level.
After physical therapy evaluation she was deemed a candidate for short term rehab.
Once stable in the ICU she was bronched which showed thick/tan secretions c/w aspiration of food involving the Right lower lobe.
U/S was done and no DVT was seen in the bilateral subclavian veins.
During the early morning of [**11-19**] the patient was noted to have decreased mental status.
