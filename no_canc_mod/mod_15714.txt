HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted initially to the CICU service for anaphylaxis thought to be secondary to Keflex.
However, it was later stated that the patient had taken the Keflex in an attempted overdose and suicide attempt.
In the VICU she was extubated on the first day and received epinephrine and continued steroids, H1 and H2 blockers and had some difficulty talking.
There was no rash or pruritus.
This was thought to be secondary to ventilator associated pneumonia at which point she was started on Levaquin.
She had trouble with throat "closing."
Her gas at this time showed a PO2 of 60, therefore she was transferred back to the CICU for closer observation, however, it was felt that a large majority of this is due to a psychologic component.

She was started on Serevent for long acting agents for bronchospasm and clinically improved at which point she was determined medically stable for discharge and was evaluated by the psychiatry team and transferred to an inpatient facility.
