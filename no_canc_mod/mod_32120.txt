History of Present Illness: 86y RHF with HTN, HL, afib on amio/BB/warfarin(INR=2.4@OSH) was air-lifted from [**Hospital3 7569**] this morning out of concern for acute stroke.
By report, the OSH assessment was NIHSS=19, but no details.
She arrived in NAD with VSS and prominent right-sided weakness, as reported.
My NIHSS on arrival was 14 (see below for NIHSS and detailed Neurologic exam).
We got a NCHCT here, which confirmed absence of hemorrhage; CTA head/neck revealed near-total obstuction of the distal M1 on the Left, as well as collateral filling of several distal MCA-distribution vessels; CTP showed increased MTT throughout the Left MCA distribution, with a mismatched CBV result (mildly decreased volume in the Left MCA distribution, in contrast to the dramatically increased MTT; CBF was moderately decreased).
We activated [**Doctor First Name 10788**] (attg/fellow @[**Hospital1 112**]) and anesthesiology, ~5-5.5h out from the onset at that point, and had the patient intubated in the ED and sent to [**Doctor First Name 10788**] for attempted interventional clot removal.
A stat NCHCT after the procedure revealed swelling and hyperintensity in the caudate/putamen and GP on the side of the infarct, with mass effect into the R-LV; difficult to tell at this stage how much is contrast dye from the [**Doctor First Name 10788**] procedure vs. how much is hemorrhagic conversion related to the procedure in the setting of INR 1.9.
HTN 2.
CAD/CHF with multivalvular disease including MR (details unknown to me at this time) s/p PPM 4.
GI: Soft, some tenderness around PEG site.

Hemorrhage in the left caudate head and putamen with surrounding edema is relatively stable.
No progression of hemorrhage is seen.
There is opacification of the sphenoid sinuses unchanged.
CXR : [**2159-2-3**]:  Severe cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema have improved since [**2-1**], subsequently unchanged.
Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in standard placements.
No pneumothorax.
Brief Hospital Course: 86y F with a Left-MCA distal occlusion could be embolic, given her known a-fib, although the therapeutic INR mitigates this probability a bit.
She arrived in NAD with VSS and prominent right-sided weakness, as reported.
A stat NCHCT after the procedure revealed swelling and hyperintensity in the caudate/putamen and GP on the side of the infarct, with mass effect into the R-LV   contrast dye from the [**Doctor First Name 10788**] procedure vs. how much is hemorrhagic.
the family was made aware that she has a possible poor outcome.
She appeared to initially be sensitive to a drop in SBP less than 140.
For risk factor reduction her LDL was 34.
Mild PA HTN.
Gastrointestinal / Abdomen: - Famotidine for prophylaxis.
Lidoderm patch for back/knee pain   Discharge Medications: 1. levothyroxine 112 mcg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for hypothyroidism (home med).
Ondansetron 4 mg IV Q8H:PRN nausea / vomiting 5. bisacodyl 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).
8. albuterol sulfate 0.63 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for sob, wheeze.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 11496**] - [**Location (un) **]  Discharge Diagnosis: New - Left MCA stroke with hemorrhagic transformation.
You were found to have a left MCA stroke and you had in intervention completed for clot retrieval.
