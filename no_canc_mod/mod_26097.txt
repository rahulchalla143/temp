Brief Hospital Course: 55 year old male with hx of HTN, HLD who presented to ED with 2 hours of substernal crushing 10/10 chest pain and evolving ST elevations.
# s/p STEMI: Patient had 2 hours of chest pain by time of arrival in ED, continued chest pain through Catheterization until end of procedure, found to have 100% occlusion mid RCA.
ST elevations in inferior leads resolved after PCI.
Patient appears to have had unstable angina for the past two years at night while at rest in bed.
He continued to have some intermittent chest pain immediately post catherization.
The patient was chest pain free in the 24 hours prior to discharge and had no arrythmias on telemetry in hours 24-48 post-cardiac catherization.
He did have some runs of VT and transient bradycardia to 40s that were thought secondary to reperfusion.
Echo showed nearly preserved ejection fraction with some mild posterior hypokinesis.
He takes lisinopril 40mg [**Hospital1 **] at home, used to take HCTZ but stopped taking it 2-3 months ago because of nocturia and because his Rx ran out.
