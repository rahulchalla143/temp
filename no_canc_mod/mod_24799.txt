Approximately [**3-4**] blocks into his walk, he developed sharp chest pain along the anterior chest in a band like pattern associated with SOB.
The pain persisted until he sat down to watch the play.
In the days following, he continued to have pain upon exertion, occuring shorter distances (approximately 100 feet).
Today, the patient first complained of chest pain driving to [**Location (un) 86**] that was releived with 1 SL NTG.
He was sent for a nuclear stress test two days prior to admission.
This showed large areas of infarct and smaller areas of peri-infarct ischemia involving the LAD and RCA.
Severely depressed LV systolic function (EF: 35%).
He was noted to be volume overloaded.
He was then directly admitted for further management of ACS and volume overload.
Upon arrival to the CCU, he was chest pain free and had no complaints.

We planned to treat this total occlusion with PTCA/stenting and heparin was started prophylactically.
A 6Fr long sheath was exchanged in for right femoral access and a [**Doctor Last Name **] 3 guide provided good support for the procedure.
A Prowater wire was used to cross the mid LAD total occlusion with minimal difficulty.
We pre-dilated the mid LAD lesion with an Apex OTW 2.75x15mm balloon at 12atm for 10sec.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI 3 flow established in LAD.
R 6Fr femoral artery long sheath removed and angioseal closure devive deployed with no complications.
Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LCx had 30% proximal stenosis and 40% in the OM.
The RCA had 30% proximal stenosis and 50% distal.
Partial resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated systemic arterial systolic with a SBP of 150mmHg and a normal systemic arterial diastolic pressure with a DBP of 71mmHg.
Successful PTCA/stenting of the mid LAD total occlusion with an overlapping Promus OTW 2.75x23mm drug-eluting stent (DES) post-dilated to 3.0mm with a Promus OTW 2.5x12mm [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]-dilated to 2.75mm distally.

Brief Hospital Course: 84 yo M h/o HTN, CKD stage III, p/w ongoing chest pain concerning for UA/NSTEMI as well as concern for CHF exacerbation.
# Unstable Angina/ACS - Patient appeared to have anterior infarct of unknown age, evidenced by both EKG, echocardiogram, and nuclear stress test.
Patient had echocardiogram that showed EF of 35-40% with akinesis of the distal LV and apex with hypokinesis of the anterior wall.
Coumadin was started for risk of thrombus formation due to his LV akinesis.
He was stable throughout the weekend with one episode of chest pain, located in his axilla, that was relieved with 3 doses of nitro and Tylenol, we attribute this episode of cp to unstable angina.
He had a cardiac catheterization on [**8-9**] that showed three vessel disease with 100% occlusion of his mid LAD.
Patient also had 30% occlusion of RCA and circumflex.
Patient was chest pain free and had no difficulty ambulating at discharge.
# CHF - On arrival, the patient had bilateral crackles as well as bilateral pitting edema, and evidence of pulmonary congestion on CXR.
He was given IV lasix with good urine output and improvement of his edema and crackles.
Patient was discharged with instructions to follow a low salt diet with fluid restriction.
Patient was pre-treated with acetylcysteine in preparation for contrast that would be received during catheterization.
Patient received 400cc of contrast during his catheterization and was then given 600cc of D5NS with total of 90meq of HCO3.
His lisinopril was held [**2-2**] elevated serum cr; also held at discharge in preparation for insult that may result to the kidneys after receiving contrast during catheterization.
Thyroid function tests suggested subclinical hypothyroidism with mildly elevated TSH and normal free T4, low T3.
