He now has progressive aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation.
He has had dyspnea on exertion and now has had several episodes of dyspnea that awoke him from sleep.
He was admitted to MWMC a week prior to this visit for increased shortness of breath and found to be in failure.
On [**6-24**] he underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed three vessel coronary artery disease with patent bypasses, severe aortic stenosis, moderate left diastolic ventricular dysfunction, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
An echo was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 55%, critical aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.8cm, moderate aortic insufficiency, moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
He was not a Corevalve candidate due to his mixed valve disease.
-A chest CT revealed distal ascending, arch, and descending aortic calcifications.
Three days ago he was placed on Keflex for a possible right medial shin cellulitis which appears today much improved.

The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
Left ventricular dysnchrony is present.
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is a small echodensity on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve -- see images #81-84.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Electronically signed by [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD, Interpreting physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2189-8-24**] 15:47  Intra-op TEE [**2189-7-21**] Conclusions PRE-CPB: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
No thoracic aortic dissection is seen.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**1-18**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is moderate central MR. [**Name14 (STitle) 50182**]: There is a bioprosthetic valve in the aortic postion.
There is a significant paravalvular leak in the area of the right coronary cusp next to the commisure between the right and left cusps, causing moderate AI.
On POD 2 he was re-intubated following an episode of unresponsiveness/respiratory distress.
He developed thrombocytopenia and a HIT panel later returned negative.
On post-operative day six he began to present with a septic picture and was seen by the Infectious Disease service.
He was treated for ventilator associated pneumonia with ciprofloxacin, Zosyn and vancomycin.
Likely due to sepsis he developed multi-system organ failure.
He developed acute tubular nephrosis and started CVVHD on post-operative day eight.
He developed liver failure with an elevated bilirubin requiring a glucose infusion.
A CT of the abdomen and pelvis showed no bowel ischemia.
The abdominal exploration revealed no abnormal abdominal processes.
A PEG tube was unable to be placed secondary to anatomy.
A wound care consult was requested secondary to bleeding at the right forearm and aquacel dressings were recommended.
He developed an ileus and TPN was subsequently begun as he was intolerant of tube feeding.
Heparin was continued for his chronic atrial fibrillation.
He developed herpetic stomatitis and was treated with IV Acyclovir.
The patient continue to fail all attempts to wean his pressor requirement and to wean from mechanical ventilation.
