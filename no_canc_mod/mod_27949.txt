Small L Pneumothorax, Moderate R pneumothorax CT ABDOMEN - negative  Brief Hospital Course: The patient was evaluated in the ED, and a right chest tube thoracostomy was performed without complications.
The pain service was consulted and analgesia was achieved with a morphine PCA and Toradol.
Flexion-extension films of the patient's C-spine were performed to rule out soft tissue injury to the neck, and the C-spine was cleared by these as well as clinically.
The patient had low oxygen saturations (low 90s resting on high flow NC, 80s with ambulation on RA), so agressive chest PT, IS, and pain control were pursued to allow increased tidal volumes, and this improved the patient's 02 saturations over the next several days in hospital.
The patient had complaints of intermittent L arm paresthesias which were evaluated.
The patient was stable, with pain controlled, adequate ambulatory saturations on HD#6, and discharged to home with instructions for follow up in the trauma clinic.
