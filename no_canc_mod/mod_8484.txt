The patient lives with her husband and son, the day prior to current admission she sustained a mechanical fall slipping and falling onto left side, stiking side of head and the left hip without LOC.
She was seen in [**Hospital1 18**] ED where a head c-spine CT were neg and pelvic x-rays showed nondisplaced left superior and inferior pubic rami fracture which was deemed non operable.

Pertinent Results: [**8-5**] CXR IMPRESSION: Apparently chronic left pleural effusion with a subpulmonic component.
No consolidation or edema noted.
Limited examination due to streak artifact from a left hip prosthesis.
Allowing for this, findings are consistent with fractures of the left inferior and superior pubic rami, with extraperitoneal hematoma on the left measuring approximately 2.5 x 6.5 cm.
Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
Stable appearance of postoperative changes of prior right hemicolectomy as well as aortic branch vessel stenting and aortobiiliac replacement.

# Pelvic fracture: Imaging shows a mildly displaced fracture of the left inferior pubic ramus as well as fracture of the left superior pubic ramus.
She may continue on tylenol 500-1000mg TID:PRN pain + oxycodone 2.5mg Q6 hours as needed for pain.
Patient did have a brief episode of delirium the morning of discharge which may have been secondary to oxycodone, but oxycodone works well for her pain control.
She may also continue on lidocaine patch to left hip as well for pain.
# Fall Likely mechanical etiology.
No loss of consciousness.
Per family, patient has history of multiple mechanical falls at home.
Patient does have a history of critical aortic stenosis, but unlikely to have been a syncopal episode; patient has no history of syncope, angina, heart failure exacerbations, per family.
Family has worked to set up house with minimal fall risks and is also interested in other ways to manage pain.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
There was also concern that you might have a urinary tract infection, but a repeat test showed no infection.
Please START taking Oxycodone 2.5 mg for pain as needed as often as every 6 hours, particularly before movement.
