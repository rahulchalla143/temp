He presents to the [**Hospital1 18**] with sudden onset right knee pain and swelling + shaking chills.
He had been seen the previous day in the clinic of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who was concerned for an infected joint and requested that the patient come back the following day for further treatment.
The pain, however, became unbearable and the patient came back to the ED later that night.
Of note, the patient also came in with a rash which was possibly due to a dose of cefuroxime that he had received the day prior but the origin of the allergy was not clear, as he had also just taken a dose of vicodin for the first time.
Due to the appearance of the fluid, there was concern for lyme vs. septic joint.
Due to some hypotension and tachycardia in the ED, the patient was admitted to the ICU for monitoring.
On the floor he was seen by [**Month (only) 1083**] disease and was started on IV vancomycin and clindamycin (cephalosporins were avoided due to a potential cephalosporin allergy).
On [**2200-10-16**] he was noted to be tachycardiac and hypotensive.
He was given 3 liters of fluid bolus due to fluid volume deficit.
At this point, the cultures had grown out Group A strep and there was a high suspicion for toxic shock syndrome.
He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the SICU because he continued to be hypotensive and tachycardic.
Due to lack of substantial clinical improvement, on [**2200-10-19**] he returned to the operating room and underwent another open I&D of his right knee.
The rest of his hospital stay was uneventful with his [**Hospital1 **] data and vital signs within normal limits and his pain controlled.
