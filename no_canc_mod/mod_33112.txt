Admission Date:  [**2136-4-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2136-4-30**]  Date of Birth:  [**2078-8-6**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Prochlorperazine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 949**] Chief Complaint: coagulopathy/acute blood loss anemia  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Endoscopy  History of Present Illness: This is a 57 yo F with question of hemochromatosis and likely alcohol induced cirrhosis with no history of varices as well as a hisory of PE on warfarin s/p GIB both on and off warfin in the past who was referred to the ED for an elevated INR.
She saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] on the day of admission for routine follow up and for evaluation of ongoing abdominal discomfort.
She had labs drawn for routine follow up and for continued evaluation for liver transplant.
On questioning, the patient reports several days of antecendant malaise with increasing DOE.
She denies CP, palpitations, syncope, hematemesis, GERD, or melena but had been having increasing constipation with bloating and RUQ pain.
She reports increasing her intake of oranges over the last few weeks for her constipation.
She denies any medication changes, dietary changes or change in warfarin dosing.
She reports the sensation of increased bloating and abdominal girth over the last few weeks in addition to mild RUQ pain that worsened over the course of the day prior to admission.
Her history is notable for being on warfarin for PE in [**3-25**].
At endoscopy she was found to have a bleeding ulcer.
Imaging studied obtained this admission so far include a CT head which showed no signs of hemorrhage and abdominal US which showed no acites, a fatty liver, and no subcapsular hemorrhage.
She did undergo a Port-A-Cath placement due to poor peripheral venous access for serial phlebotomies which have been occurring since late [**2134**] and [**2135**].

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2136-4-27**] 9:08 PM There is no fracture, hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, shift of midline structures or evidence of major vascular territorial infarction.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY) PORT Study Date of [**2136-4-27**] 9:21 PM [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 493**] images were obtained that demonstrate the liver to be of increased echogenicity and heterogeneous echotexture compatible with known cirrhosis.
There is no ascites.
There is no subcapsular hematoma.
There is no intra- or extra- hepatic bile duct dilatation and the common bile duct measures 4.3 mm.
The gallbladder is not distended and there is no pericholecystic fluid, gallbladder wall thickening, or cholelithiasis.
The right kidney measures 9.7 cm pole to pole and the left 12.4 with no evidence for hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or renal mass.
No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for subcapsular hematoma.
Increased liver echogenicity consistent with patient's known diagnosis of cirrhosis, other forms of liver disease not excluded.
Evaluation for mass lesion severely compromised.
Persistent splenomegaly.
Brief Hospital Course: 57F with a Hx of PE on warfarin + etOH cirrhosis and possible hemochromotosis admitted with symptomatic anemia with an H/H of 6.5/18.6 and INR of 18.
Her H/H stabilized and she underwent an elective endoscopy which showed mild gastritis.
She was discharged off coumadin with close follow up to determine if the morbidity of anticoagulation outweighs the risks given this is her second GI bleed since her PE and there is little evidence that a single PE merits AC for >6 months.
# GIB: Likely in the setting of elevated INR with known portal hypertensive gastropathy.
No history of varices, though patient does have known cirrhosis complicated by acites and recent weight gain with increased abdominal girth.
Of note, patient has chronic anemia, and iron studies in [**Month (only) 956**] of this year demonstrated iron deficiency anemia with a ferritin of 17.
Her history is also notable for increasing constipation possibly due to melena as well as malaise, DOE, and HA likely due to symptomatic anemia.
Discontinued warfarin as no longer needed for single PE and clearly morbid in the patient.
EGD [**2136-4-30**] showed mild gastritis and no bleeding varices or ulcers.
# Coagulopathy: On review of OMR, it appears that the patient has had a number of elevated PTTs since starting ciprofloxacin for SBP PPx in addition to warfarin.
During her last admission in [**Month (only) 956**], warfarin was repeatedly held for elevated INRs.
Patient denies any changes in her coumadin dosing or any other changes in medication.
Pt is >1 year out from PE and there is little evidence of benefit of ongoing anticoagulation in a patient with a single event and no known hypercoaguable state.
# Cirrhosis: Thought to be secondary to etOH, though patient does have a questionable history of hemachromatosis and had undergone serial phlebotomy in the past with minimal improvement.
She is currently complaining of RUQ discomfort and is tender on exam.
Additionally, she notes she has had increased abdominal distention over the last several week with no appreciable ascites on exam.
Had been on warfarin for the last year now with her second GI bleed.
# Seizure disorder: Continued home LeVETiracetam 1000 mg PO BID.
# Depression: Continued home Venlafaxine XR 225 mg PO DAILY.
Trazodone 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia.
Lactulose 10 gram Packet Sig: [**2-17**] packets PO three times a day as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Upper GI bleed .
Secondary: IgA deficiency, hyperlipidemia  Discharge Condition: Stable hematocrit, tolerating POs, at baseline.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with a very high INR and low hematocrit (measure of anemia).
Please call your doctor or come to the emergency room if you experience bleeding, dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, passing out, ongoing diarrhea or vomiting, or other concerning symptoms.
