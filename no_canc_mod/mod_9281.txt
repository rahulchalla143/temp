Admission Date:  [**2185-2-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2185-2-16**]  Date of Birth:   [**2145-9-3**]     Sex:  M  Service:  CCU  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea on exertion.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 39 year-old gentleman with a past medical history of pulmonary sarcoidosis recently diagnosed congestive heart failure who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac hesitation due to recent symptomatic exacerbation.
His cardiac history dates back to [**2184-6-20**] where he presented with symptoms of congestive heart failure.
TTE revealed mild right ventricle dilatation with preserved function, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, inferior and posterior wall akinesis with an EF of 20%, moderate MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] PA systolic pressure around 15 mmHg.
On [**7-21**] the Holter showed recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachycardia for which he had an electrophysiology study done, which was noninducible for ventricular tachycardia.
He had a cardiac catheterization in [**Month (only) 216**], which revealed severe biventricular failure with mild pulmonary hypertension, 2+ mitral regurgitation and normal coronary arteries.
An RV endomyocardial biopsy was negative for sarcoidosis.
In [**2184-8-21**] an AICD was placed prophylactically for ventricular ectopy.
Over the next several months congestive heart failure improved from class three to class one and he was able to go back to work on an assembly line.
Symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue returned about a month ago when he began working full time.
At that time he became several short of breath when walking up a flight of stairs, which is consistent with congestive heart failure class three.
He had a stress test on [**2185-2-8**] to evaluate exercise tolerance where he exercised for fifteen minutes on the Dobutamine protocol, which was then stopped for hypertension at peak exercise.
Hemodynamic monitoring, diuresis were continued and anatropic support.
Congestive heart failure from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
The patient's biopsy was negative for sarcoidosis.
Runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia status post ICD placement.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Brother with congenital heart disease.
In general he was a middle aged man lying comfortably in no acute distress.
Heart regular rate and rhythm, intermittent S3 with no murmurs or rubs.
Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Chest x-ray revealed that he was in congestive heart failure.
On the floor he did exceptionally well with stable systolic blood pressures above 80 with absolutely no shortness of breath on ambulation.
During his admission he was evaluated as stated for a cardiac transplant by the [**Hospital 4415**] congestive heart failure team, a carotid ultrasound, ankle brachial indices and 24 hour urine collection for creatinine clearance and protein were obtained for a preop workup.
They came to the conclusion that there was no evidence of reactivation of his sarcoidosis.
FOLLOW UP:  Return to the hospital if you develop worsening shortness of breath or weight gain.
Congestive heart failure secondary to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
Pulmonary sarcoidosis.
History of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia status post AICD placement.
