At 6:30AM on the day of admission, the patient descended the stairs to the living room in his house where his wife witnessed him having difficulty breathing, described as "raspy" by his wife.
He received atropine 1mg x3 and epinephrine 1mg with return of pulse in rapid a fib and pressure 60/palp.
In the ED, the patient was found to have hyperkalemia and severe metabolic acidosis (pH 6.7).
He received 2amps calcium gluconate, insulin and D50, 2 amps sodium bicarb and kayexalate as treatment for hyperkalemia.
He underwent CTA which was negative for PE or aortic abnormality.
He received 3 amps sodium bicarb in D5 and mucomyst prophylaxis in advance of possible cardiac cartheterization.
Review of systems is notable for no cardiac complaints with the exception of his apparent shortness of breath.
The family denies recent fevers or cough.
His wife states that the patient recently complained of gout-type symptoms in his big toe.
No report of dysarthria or gait disturbances, headache or blurry vision.
PVD: had stents to distal aortia, bilateral common iliac arteries, and left external iliac artery [**2163-4-12**].
Had abnormal ABIs subsequently [**2163-5-25**] but further intervention was deferred at that time because his symptoms had substantially improved until 1 month ago (see HPI).
HTN 4.
Hypercholesterolemia 5.
CAD 7. s/p ccy 8. retroperitoneal fibrosis s/p bilateral ureterolysis with omental wrap, [**4-/2150**].
HEENT: 4cm fixed and dilated pupils bilaterally.

Downgoing ST depressions in V3-5.
Deepening of inverted T's in the inferior leads and more pronounced downsloping ST depression in V3-5 compared to prior dated [**2165-3-21**].
[**2166-2-12**] TELEMETRY: In the field, paddle strip reveals likely PEA or near asystole with return to sinus rhythm with ST elevations after therapy.
Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
No pulmonary embolism.
No acute aortic abnormalities identified.
Severe atherosclerotic disease of the aorta, with calcified plaque along the descending aorta.
Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
Patchy airspace opacity at the left lung base may represent a small amount of aspiration.
Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 76 yo M with a history of CAD, PVD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus II and chronic kidney disease admitted after becoming unresponsive at home found to have a cardiac arrest now with profound metabolic acidosis.
Unclear of underlying etiology.
This seems unlikely to be of primary cardiac etiology with non-diagnostic EKG changes and modest cardiac enzyme elevations.
Sepsis as a preceding etiology seems possible given report of infectious-type symptoms including fatigue and chills the evening prior to his event.
Infection and relative hypovolemia precipitating acute on chronic renal failure as an etiology for uremia/acidosis and hyperkalemia is also possible.
CTA negative for PE or aortic abnormality.
Prolonged period (30 minutes) unresponsive prior to rescucitation and profound metabolic acidosis portend a poor prognosis.
Patient continued to deteriorate with hyperkalemia and progressing renal failure, exhibiting signs of profound neurologic impairment.
Goal of care were re-adressed with family, who reported patient's wishes were to not have dialysis or life support.
Patient had tested positive for the Influenza Virus.
