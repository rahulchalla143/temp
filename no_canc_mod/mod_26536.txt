Imaging: EGD ([**11-19**]): Varices at the lower third of the esophagus Nodularity, congestion, erythema and mosaic appearance in the stomach body and fundus compatible with severe portal hypertensive gastropathy Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum .
No biliary dilatation seen.
Nodular heterogeneous liver consistent with the patient's known cirrhosis.
Splenomegaly and mild ascites.
Multifocal ground-glass opacities in the left upper lobe consistent with infection.
Bilateral small pleural effusions with secondary atelectasis.
The right atelectasis has a small component that is hypoattenuating in comparison to the other components and might represent pneumonia.
Known cirrhosis with portosystemic collaterals and large ascites.
No signs of bowel obstruction.
Acute left tenth rib fracture.
Abdominal ultrasound ([**11-28**]): Scans of the upper and lower abdomen demonstrates a large volume of ascites, predominantly on the right side.
There are low lung volumes with crowding of the bronchovascular markings.
Streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflect atelectasis.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.
There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis.
No evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.
Better seen than on the previous radiograph is a right medial basal opacity with several air bronchograms.
This opacity might represent atelectasis, but the possibility of early pneumonia cannot be excluded.
There is interval progression of bilateral pleural effusions, small-to-moderate and bibasilar consolidations, highly concerning for infectious process.
There is no pneumothorax.
CXR ([**11-28**]): IMPRESSION: Persistent moderate cardiac enlargement with bilateral pleural effusions and plate atelectasis on the bases, suspicious new acute pneumonic infection in left upper lobe area.
No pneumothorax.
KUB ([**11-22**]): IMPRESSION: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern without evidence of ileus or obstruction.
KUB ([**11-23**]): There is evidence of mild dilatation of the large bowel with the proximal portion of the transverse colon measuring up to 7 cm.
Mild dilatation of small bowel is demonstrated but overall the findings are nonspecific with no definitive evidence of ileus or obstruction.
Degenerative changes are noted within the spine.
The decubitus view reveals no evidence of free air.
KUB ([**11-24**]): As compared to [**2176-11-23**], there is slight additional increase in the diameter of the proximal portion of the transverse colon, up to 8 cm as compared to 7 cm on the prior examination.
The rest of the bowel demonstrate no evidence of progression of dilatation.
No appreciable free air is demonstrated on the decubitus view.
Overall, no evidence of obstruction or progression of the ileus is seen.
Brief Hospital Course: 60 yo M with PMH of alcohol abuse, Class B Childs Cirrhosis, known esophageal varices on Nadolol who presented with hematemesis, intubated in ED for airway protection due to significant vomiting, s/p EGD without intervention, with a hospital course complicated by abdominal distention and HCAP.
# GIB: Initially, it was thought to be possible variceal bleed given known cirrhosis and varices on past EGD.
There were stigmata of recent bleeding and possible GAVE.
He was given SC Vitamin K for INR 1.9 and hepatic dysfunction.
He continued to have melanotic stool without drop in Hct for several days, which then resolved prior to discharge.
# Ileus: Patient with 2 days of abdominal distension, KUB down in ICU showed distended loops of bowel raising concern for obstruction vs. ileus.
Patient did not have a BM for the first 24 hours on the medical floor again raising concern for obstruction or ileus, although KUB was not consistent with either.
The patient did have a small BM on the night of [**11-23**] after biscodyl suppository x 2 and a fleet's eneema with a scant amount of bright red blood.
Stool output increased starting [**11-25**] with resolution of abdominal pain and distention.
Patient required electrolyte repletion during recovery from ileus, likely due to high stool output.
# HCAP:  Patient spiked a fever to 101.8 on the night of [**11-23**] and had a CXR that showed new bibasilar consolidations concerning for infection.
Patient was also noted to have a non-productive cough.
CT chest revealed multifocal pneumonia.
He remained afebrile for over 72 hours prior to discharge.
# Cirrhosis: EtOH cirrhosis decompensated w/ varices, ascites, encephalopathy, thrombocytopenia.
Paracentesis performed [**11-29**] with good success, negative for SBP.
Transitional Issues: - Blood culture pending final result - Patient required repletion of electrolytes due to high stool output.
This may be restarted by outpatient providers if his BP rises.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: portal gastropathy multifocal pneumonia  Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
You were found to have a large gastrointestinal bleed.
Your bleeding stopped, but you were found to have developed a pneumonia.
You had fevers and difficulty breathing.
This was treated with several antibiotics, after which your fever and breathing both improved.
