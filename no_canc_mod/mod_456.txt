There is no focal consolidation, large effusion, or pneumothorax.
There are no abnormal cardiac or mediastinal contours.
Basilar atelectasis is noted.
CXR [**2119-9-11**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increasing radiodensity in the right lung, predominating in the right upper lobe.
Developing pneumonia cannot be excluded.
As a result, hyperlucency of the left lung apex without definite signs of pneumothorax is seen.
Lung volumes have minimally decreased, but the pre-existing signs suggesting fluid overload have decreased.
No evidence of pleural effusions, interposition of colon between the liver and the abdominal wall.
Right upper lobe opacity has completely resolved.
There is only minimal bibasilar atelectasis.
No significant pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
CT Head without contrast [**2119-9-15**]:  pending at time of discharge   Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY: 54 yo M w/ h/o Down's syndrome, non-verbal at baseline, hypothyroidism, dysphagia s/p G-tube, h/o aspiration pna's, hypoNa on 4Lnc QHS who presents w/ cough and hypoxia from group home.
The etiology of his hypotension is likely secondary to acute infection.
On CXR he has a possible right lobe infiltrate that could represent infection, pneumonitis or pulmonary edema.
He was started on IV Vanc and Zosyn for coverage of healthcare associated pneumonia since he lives in a group home.
No evidence of CHF by exam or CXR.
No history of CHF in past.
Could be secondary to infiltrate in right lobe that could represent pneumona, pneumonitis or pulmonary edema.
EKG did not have any ischemic changes.
On [**9-10**] patient had RIJ placed and follow up CXR showed small pneumothorax but there was no change in the patient's respiratory status.
# pulmonary edema: No cardiac history, but patient developed findings c/w pulmonary edema on CXR after minimal fluids.
# Seizure Disorder: Etiology unclear.
Myoclonic jerks observed after transfer from MICU to the floor, and EEG showed seizure activity.
# Down's syndrome, non-verbal at baseline: Per NH at baseline.
Given his lack of responsiveness, head imaging was performed to ensure lack of new pathology.
The medical team stated that the patient's overall life expectancy is in the range of months, but that this could be much shorter if he has an acute respiratory event.
However, treating these infections may require him to remain in a hospital, which his family agrees is not the best setting for his comfort.
They recognized that this course of treatment may not provide him any long-term benefit, and that he could die while undergoing the treatment.
Please evaluate for evidence of seizure-like activity.
Please check his sodium and fluid balance, as he presented initially with hyponatremia, likely secondary to dehydration.
Patient tested positive for MRSA, and should be on contact precautions.
Head CT read pending on discharge, may show signs of subacute pathology that changes his overall prognosis.
