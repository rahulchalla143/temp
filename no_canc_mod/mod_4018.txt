Myocardial infarction.
Coronary artery disease.
Persistent atrial fibrillation.
Acute renal failure, resolved.
Right-sided cerebrovascular accident with left arm weakness.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old woman whose problems began with chronic back pain usually controlled with Tylenol.
She noted an exacerbation on [**2141-2-12**] and was admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) 620**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for low back pain.
During her work-up there she received an x-ray which confirmed a compression fracture at the L3 level.
The patient did, however, develop chest pain and shortness of breath on [**2141-2-15**].
Ultimately, the patient ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 120 and a peak troponin of 5.0.
The patient was transferred back to her [**Hospital3 **] facility and was otherwise asymptomatic until [**2141-2-24**] when the patient developed persistent severe chest pain in the morning.
She was brought in at that time for probable cardiac catheterization and evaluation of her chest pain.
Congestive heart failure.
Atrial fibrillation.
History of urinary retention.
History of syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone.
Myocardial infarction.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission in general the patient was an elderly woman in no acute distress.
Neck was supple, midline without masses or lymphadenopathy.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended without masses or organomegaly.
Neurologic examination was alert and oriented with no gross defect.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for work-up of her chest pain and history of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2141-2-24**] which revealed the ejection fraction of 45%, a right dominant coronary artery system with severe three-vessel disease.
Also noted was mild mitral regurgitation as well.
The patient was in persistent atrial fibrillation in the CSRU.
She did have a low urine output for which the renal service was consulted.
They came up with an assessment of oliguria with hyponatremia and acute renal failure.
In addition, the patient's low cardiac output and congestive heart failure picture prompted recatheterization.
The patient was taken back to the operating room on [**2141-3-2**] for reexploration of left internal mammary artery torsion.
The renal service continued to follow for renal failure and Mucomyst was initiated.
The ultimate etiology for renal failure was thought to be ATN, multifactorial, with prerenal component due to congestive heart failure, contrast nephropathy, ischemic ATN from intraoperative hypoperfusion.
In the evening of [**2141-3-3**] the patient was found to have a focal neurologic deficit with difficulty moving the left upper extremity.
Stroke service was consulted for likely embolic event given the patient's atrial fibrillation and occasional conversion to sinus rhythm.
Head CT revealed a hypodensity over the right frontoparietal area in the posterior watershed distribution.
The stroke service recommended anticoagulation with Coumadin, keeping the blood pressure greater than 130/80, MRI and carotid ultrasound.
Throughout this period the patient remained in atrial fibrillation with occasional rapid response.
However, the patient ultimately remained in atrial fibrillation.
During her period on the floor the patient's main issues were simply diuresis as well as anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation.
pain medications and having a therapeutic INR.
The patient reported no more symptoms of chest pain or angina.
She had some residual left upper arm weakness with recommended follow up as an outpatient by neurology.
There was some noted left upper extremity proximal weakness.
The patient should follow up with the neurology service in between 2-4 weeks for evaluation of her right-sided cerebrovascular accident.
