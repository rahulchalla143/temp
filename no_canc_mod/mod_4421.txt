Admission Date:  [**2142-5-1**]       Discharge Date:  [**2142-5-12**]  Date of Birth:   [**2071-2-22**]       Sex:  M  Service:  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT & [**Hospital 259**] MEDICAL FIRM  CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient's chief complaint of initial presentation to outside hospital was fever and palpitations.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71 year old man with a past medical history as described below, who initially presented to an outside hospital on [**2142-4-30**], with confusion, fatigue, fevers and palpitations.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] the following day for further evaluation of hypotension and decreased urine output.
At the outside hospital, he was also noted to be in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and had an elevation in his cardiac enzymes.
Upon transfer, the patient was started empirically on Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone as treatment for meningitis given his change in mental status.
MRI of the head was performed which showed an old cerebellar infarction and micro-angiopathic changes, but no acute infarction.
CT scan of the chest without contrast was done initially because of the patient's acute renal failure and it showed only small bilateral pleural effusions.
The patient continued to be hypoxic however, with an increased A:A gradient.
The patient had been anti-coagulated with Lovenox at the outside hospital because of his atrial fibrillation, however CT angiogram was performed again to rule out pulmonary embolism.
Prior to the CT angiogram being done, the patient experienced a significant episode of hematemesis for which the heparin drip was stopped.
CT angiogram was eventually done which showed a left anterior segmental pulmonary embolism.
Bilateral lower extremity non-invasive studies were done which were negative for deep vein thrombosis and the patient was restarted on the heparin drip.
Later that evening, on [**2142-5-3**], the patient became acutely hypoxic with O2 saturations in the 70s; his skin was mottled.
The patient was intubated for respiratory failure.
His temperature at that time was noted to be 102.0 F.  Subsequently, the patient became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s which responded to aggressive volume resuscitation.
A transesophageal echocardiogram was done to evaluate for right ventricular thrombus, and revealed dilatation of the right ventricle and mild global hypokinesis but no intramural thrombus.
As the patient's blood pressure improved on intravenous fluids, lysis of his pulmonary embolism and likely recurrent massive pulmonary embolus was deferred.
In the setting of this acute stress, the patient had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with a peak troponin of 3.2.
He remained hemodynamically stable and anti-coagulated on heparin which was again complicated by a gastrointestinal bleed in which the patient had significant amounts of melena.
The patient's stool continued to be occult blood positive from that time on, but he had no further frank melena.
Following extubation, the patient was total body overloaded from his aggressive volume resuscitation, approximately 13 liters for length of stay and was diuresed aggressively between one and two liters per day, which he tolerated well.
Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2140**] at [**Hospital6 **] Hospital.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   At the time of admission, the patient was afebrile at 98.8 F., heart rate was 76; blood pressure 136/66; respiratory rate 20 and he was saturating 100% on a face tent at 15 liters per minute.
In general, he complained only of fatigue, but he was in no acute distress and was alert and oriented times three.
Examination of his neck revealed no jugular venous distention.
His heart examination was regular without murmur, although Telemetry revealed a rhythm of atrial flutter.
His lung examination at the time revealed diffuse expiratory wheezing.
Extremity examination revealed two plus peripheral edema throughout.
He had very rare short bursts of pleuritic chest pain on the left side.
EKG was checked at one of these occasions which was unchanged from the previous and the pain was only fleeting with no elevations of cardiac enzymes.
FEVER:  The patient initially presented to the outside hospital with fevers and continued to have fever to 102.0 F., at [**Hospital1 69**].
A thorough work-up was done including lumbar puncture as listed above and various viral serologies at the recommendation of the Infectious Disease consultation.
Because the patient is from [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 **] area, numerous etiologies were thought plausible and the patient was ruled out for both influenzae both A and B, CMV, Lyme Disease, EBV, both IgG and IgM were checked with the IgG positive, Histoplasma and Ehrlichia and RSV, all of which were negative.
It was felt that the patient either had a viral syndrome to explain his fever or that the fever was due to the pulmonary embolism itself.
NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION:  This was felt to be due secondary to demand in the setting of atrial flutter in the rate of 150s and massive pulmonary embolism.
Aspirin was held, however, because of his gastrointestinal bleeding.
The patient was started on Captopril which was titrated to 25 three times a day at the time of discharge and converted to Lisinopril 10 mg for decreased pill burden at the time of discharge.
In addition, he was started on Lopressor which was titrated to 50 mg twice a day and converted to atenolol once daily, again, for decreased pill burden.
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient did not have either esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy this admission because of the ongoing need for anti-coagulation as well as his high O2 requirements earlier on in the hospital course.
ATRIAL FLUTTER:  It is unclear if the atrial flutter / fibrillation, preceded the pulmonary embolism in which the patient had a cardiac embolic event or if the pulmonary embolism led to the irregular heart rhythm.
Regardless, the patient was rate controlled with beta blocker and anti-coagulated already for his pulmonary embolism.
Cardiology was consulted regarding the treatment of his atrial flutter and it was felt while he was adequately rate controlled, that there was no need for acute intervention.
It is possible that with treatment and resolution of his pulmonary embolism, the patient may convert back to sinus rhythm on his own, which is why no acute intervention was done.
Because of his falling hematocrit in the setting of his gastrointestinal bleed, the patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells on [**2142-5-4**].
In addition, because of a slow decrease in his hematocrit over the subsequent three days, the patient was transfused one further unit of packed red blood cells on [**2142-5-7**].
Following that blood transfusion, the patient's hematocrit remained stable between 33 and 35, requiring no further blood transfusions.
VOLUME OVERLOAD:  Following the patient's hypotensive episode and aggressive volume resuscitation, he was ultimately approximately 13 liters positive for length of stay in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.
The patient's anasarca resolved over a period of three to four days with no peripheral edema at the time of discharge.
Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
New atrial fibrillation / flutter.
The patient is to follow-up with his primary care physician upon return to [**Location (un) **] for measurements of INR and dosing adjustments of his Coumadin.
In addition, he is to follow-up with his cardiologist in approximately one month for further management of his atrial flutter.
