CLINICAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 449**] is a 65 year old gentleman who was admitted from home with a 2 1/2 hour history of acute abdominal pain.

In the following days, the patient's clinical course continued to decline with evidence of increasing abdominal tenderness, abdominal distention and on hospital day #4 darkened urine.
On hospital day #7 the patient began having increasingly frequent febrile episodes and had an increase in white blood cell count.
Computerized tomography scan at that time was consistent with acute pancreatitis with increased peripancreatic inflammatory changes.
There were also areas of low density within the body and tail of the pancreas and there was increasing concern for necrosis.
The procedure proceeded without any complications and the patient was returned to the Intensive Care Unit.
Neurologic - The patient's neurological status showed poor recovery from sedation.
