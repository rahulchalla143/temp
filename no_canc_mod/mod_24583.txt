The RCA had mild disease.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left heart filling pressures with RVEDP 15 mmHg and PCWP 25 mmHg.
There were accentuated V waves in the PCW pressure tracing.
The pulmonary artery systolic  pressure was elevated at 50 mmHg.
There was systemic arterial normotension.
No transgastric views could be obtained.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] arch.
No [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] regurgitation is seen.
An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is P2 flail of the posterior mitral leaflet with a torn chordae visible.
No transgastric views could be obtained.
There is a tissue valve in the mitral position.
There is marked decrease in extent of the right pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax can be seen on the right.
On the left, a basal air-fluid level suggests the presence of minimal intrapleural air, despite the absence of visibility of a left pneumothorax.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.
Mild cardiomegaly.
Brief Hospital Course: Presented with shortness of breath and found to be hypoxic in the setting of heart failure.
He was rapidly worked up where an echo revealed severe mitral valve regurgitation with partial flail leaflet and torn chordae.
He was then brought for a cardiac catheterization which also revealed severe mitral regurgitation along with coronary artery disease.
In the setting of respiratory failure and hemodynamic instability, it was decided to bring him emergently to the operating room where he underwent a mitral valve replacement with coronary artery bypass graft.
Remained on inotropes and pressors that were weaned off over the first few days postoperatively, additionally had episodes of atrial fibrillation and flutter treated with coumadin and amiodarone.
Additionally renal was consulted due to acute kidney injury post operatively.
He remained in the intensive care unit an extended stay for hemodynamic management, pulmonary monitoring, and renal management.
Coumadin was held due to increased INR and allowed to correct back on its own.
He tolerated the procedure well, and followup chest x-ray showing improvement with no signs of pneumothorax.
Following thoracentesis, Coumadin was resumed for atrial fibrillation and should be adjusted for goal INR between 2.0 - 2.5.
