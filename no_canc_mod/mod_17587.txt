Admission Date:  [**2186-6-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2186-7-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2110-10-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Aspirin / Nsaids  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1162**] Chief Complaint: Hypoxia s/p elective ERCP  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: ERCP  History of Present Illness: This is a 75 yo F with a past medical history significant for COPD, CHF, CAD s/p CABG, CVA, who became increasingly hypoxic and tachypneic following an elective ERCP today.
On the last admission in [**4-24**], the patient reportedly had cholangitis induced sepsis.
She was intubated for the procedure and received a total of 400cc LR during the procedure and 500cc of fluid in the PACU.
An ABG and CXR were requested and given the patient's history of CHF and the fact that she takes daily lasix and received almost 1L of fluid in several hours, a dose of 40mg IV lasix was suggested as well.
CXR was confirmatory for diffuse perihilar infiltrates characteristic of pulmonary edema.
Past Medical History: COPD CAD s/p CABG, s/p MI CHF (reported EF=50%) HTN s/p CVA, on coumadin - residual L hemiparesis recent history of cholangitis s/p ERCP in [**4-24**] with gallstones identified; reportedly was septic at this time.

MMM neck: JVP elevated to earlobes chest: RRR lungs: decreased lung volumes with dependent rales abd: obese, soft NT/ND +BS ext: no e/c/c neuro: unable to do full neuro exam as patient is extremely sleepy.
Left lower lobe opacity, suspicious for pneumonic consolidation.
Congestive heart failure.
Brief Hospital Course: 75 yo F with acute hypoxia and tachypnea following elective ERCP, due to volume overload, exacerbated by sleep apnea.
Respiratory Distress: Given her improved CXR and clinical picture post-diuresis, it appeared that the primary cause of respiratory distress was likely fluid overload, and most likely, given that her sats were already decreased pre-procedure, that she was already volume overloaded before even receiving the additional liter of fluid pre-procedure.
Of note, the patient has multiple apneic episodes with significant desaturations while sleeping highly suggestive of OSA / central sleep apnea.
Blood gas analysis suggests improvement of respiratory acidosis with bipap 10/5/5L, likely chronic compensatory metabolic alkalosis.
On the floor the patient had one episode of oxygen desaturation to the 70s which resolved with increasing oxygen via nasal canula to 5L.
A cxr was obtained at that time which showed prominent pulmonary edema.
She will only need outpatient GI follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if she develops new abdominal symptoms or has recurrent evidence of obstruction.
Cardiac Ischemia - known CAD s/p MI, CABG.
No evidence of ischemia on EKG, enzymes negative.
The patient remained chest pain free during the entire hospitalization.
Given her history of CAD, a lipid panel was obtained showing evidence of hypercholesterolemia with a cholesterol total of 259, LDL 158, and triglycerides 250.
There were no electrolyte abnormalities during this hospitalization.
6. s/p CVA - coumadin held for ERCP -Resuming coumadin at prior dose of 5mg po daily.
She is not a candidate for lovenox given her renal function and it was felt that the risks outweighed the benefits for starting her on IV heparin at this time.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.083 % (0.83 mg/mL) Solution Sig: One (1) Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Ipratropium Bromide 0.02 % Solution Sig: One (1)  Inhalation Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for wheezing.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1439**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13089**] Care Center - [**Location (un) 1439**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Respiratory failure Acute renal failure Altered mental status Secondary diagnoisis: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Coronary Artery Disease Dyslipidemia Stroke   Discharge Condition: stable   Discharge Instructions: Patient should continue on 2L nasal canula titrated to keep oxygen saturation between 90-92% given her CO2 retention.
