Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 year old male with a history of bioprosthetic AVR in [**2162**] for recurrent endocarditis presenting with fever of 103.7, altered mental status and incontinence with blood cultures positive for Group A Strep  1)Group A strep Bacteremia: most likely explanation for presentation of high fever and altered mental status.
He was initially admitted to the MICU for close monitoring due to hypotension and high fevers.
Source of bacteremia unclear, no evidence of endocarditis on TEE.
No evidence of infection on UA, CXR or LP.
Abdominal CT did not show any evidence of abscess or other cause for bacteremia.
He was initially treated with vancomycin and gentamycin due to concern for staph bacteremia and endocarditis however this was changed to Penicillin G once cultures were positive for GAS.
He continued to improve on this regimen with no complications and he was discharged to rehab facility to complete 2 week course of Penicillin G.  A PICC line was placed prior to discharge.
2)Fecal incontinence - also with reduced rectal tone, otherwise neurologically intact.
Concerning for possiblity of cauda equina compression, however he had an MRI which did not show any evidence of nerve impingement.
Unlikely to be related to GAS bacteremia as [**Year (4 digits) **] have been present x3-6 months, no evidence of epidural abscess or osteo on MRI.
3)SVT - he has h/o SVT and had two episodes on admission while acutely bacteremic associated with hypotension to the 80's.
Has SVT at baseline that he breaks with carotid massage.
He was continued on diltiazem and did not have any further episodes of SVT.
4)left knee pain - warm, swollen L knee was somewhat concerning for possibility of secondary seeding due to bactermia.
He does report history of a fall on the day before he presented to the ED.
He had a knee xray which did show evidence of effusion.
5)[**Last Name (STitle) **]inary Incontinence - he reports three month history of intermittent urinary incontinence.
6)Thrombocytopenia - Unclear etiology, initially somewhat concerning for possiblility DIC given GAS bactermia.
7)HTN: He was hypotensive on admission likely due to bacteremia.
