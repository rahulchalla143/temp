He had recurrent episodes of confusion shaking for the past four years.
He was evaluated extensively at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital for these spelss of transient ischemic attack versus seizure.
He had several EEGs said to have been not suggestive of epileptic activity.

As part of the work-up, the Neurosurgery Service performed a conventional angiogram which reportedly showed bilateral vertebral artery stenosis, right side 70%, left side 75%.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] asked us to evaluate the patient for question of transient ischemic attack versus further management options.
