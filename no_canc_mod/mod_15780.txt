#Hypotension: likely hypovolemia due to dehydration from diuretic use and drinking of ETOH at home.
Pt did not have any infectious symptoms such as fever, leukocytosis or other localizing symptoms.
EKG not suggestive of ischemia and cardiac enzymes were negative.
TSH and cortisol not pursued as pt's symptoms resolved after IV fluids.
However, BP still ranged at times from high 90's-110's and pt was asymptomatic and ambulating without dizziness or difficulty.
Pt did not have any suggestion of ETOH withdrawal during admission and it did not appear that drinking ETOH is the norm for the patient, but that he had more drinks than normal weekend prior to admission.
Pt did not display signs of clinical CHF during admission.
Thought to be due to hypovolemia in the setting of diuretic use.
Pt should have repeat labs at his PCP appointment on [**2183-1-16**] to ensure stability of renal function.
Pt did not appear to have acute heart failure during admission.
He was set up with VNA services upon discharge to help monitor for signs of clinical heart failure in this setting of medication adjustment.
Pt should have repeat chemistry panel at upcoming PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 648**].
#Reactive airways, ?COPD- continued inhalers, no sign of acute exacerbation.
Transitional issues -close monitoring of volume status with lasix, HCTZ, and spironolactone being held.

Your symptoms were thought to be due to dehydration along with taking your medications for your heart.
Your symptoms improved with IV fluids and stopping some of your heart medications.
You may need to restart some of these medications.
