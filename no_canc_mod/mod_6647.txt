Imaging: Head CT [**2173-5-20**] IMPRESSION: 1) Right frontal lobe parenchymal contusion with hemorrhage and surrounding edema.
2) Subarachnoid hemorrhage, most prominent across the frontal lobes bilaterally, but also within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles.
3) Bilateral subdural collections in the frontotemporal parietal regions, slightly greater on the left.
4) Longitudinal fracture of the skull base.
5) Fracture of the sphenoid at the left inferior orbital fissure.
No acute intra-abdominal pathology/injury.
A 6.5 cm renal cyst arising off the superior pole of the left kidney.
[**2173-5-21**] TL spine IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture or dislocation  [**2173-5-20**] CT cspine IMPRESSION: 1.
No fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine.
Extensive degenerative changes within the cervical spine, most prominent at the C4-7 levels.
Focal areas of decreased attenuation within both lobes of the thyroid.
Evolving bilateral frontal contusions are seen with no interval increase in intraparenchymal, subarachnoid, and subdural hemorrhage.
The amount of intraventricular hemorrhage has decreased and the subdural hemorrhages are smaller compared to prior study.
No new areas of hemorrhages are identified.
Bilateral stimulator devices within the thalami are again seen.
Nondisplaced longitudinal skull base fracture is again visualized.
Small left sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] fracture is again noted.
No new intracranial hemorrhage is seen.
Neurosurgery was immiediatly consulted for bilateral subarachnoid hemorfhages, subdural hematomas, intracranial hemorrhage and basilar skull fracture.
Opthamology was consulted for a left sphenoid fracture.
There was no impingement of the nerve or muscles, and thus required no acute treatment.
His basilar skull fracture did not require treatment.
A urine culture and one set of blood cultures were positive for enterococcus which was sensitive to ampicillin.
Due to his underlying Parkinsons and dementia, and with the addition of his closed head trauma, he will require extensive rehab and reconditioning to get back to his baseline.
