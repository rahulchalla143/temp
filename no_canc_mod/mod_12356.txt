The patient reported that her pain lasted 45 minutes and was pressure radiating into both arms.
She denied nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis or shortness of breath.
On electrocardiogram, the patient had inferior ST elevation.
The patient was then med-flighted to [**Hospital1 69**] for emergent cardiac catheterization due to persistent chest pain and ST elevation.
On catheterization, the patient was found to have an elevated right ventricular end diastolic pressure of 16 consistent with right ventricular infarction.
The patient also had a 50% midvessel left anterior descending stenosis and a mild lesion in one of the diagonal branches.
Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction in [**2139-9-4**], status post angioplasty in [**2140**].
On examination, head, eyes, ears, nose and throat revealed no jugular venous distention.
Electrocardiogram on admission revealed normal sinus rhythm at 100 beats per minute, ST elevation greater than 4.0 millimeters in lead II, greater than 8.0 millimeters in lead III and greater than 6.0 millimeters in aVF.
There is reciprocal changes in lateral leads and ST depressions in V2.
She was treated with Plavix but no Aspirin due to her allergic reaction.
Intra-aortic balloon pump was pulled without difficulty.
The patient had occasional evidence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, decreasing with each hospital day.
An echocardiogram was done which showed an ejection fraction of 40 to 45% with focal basal right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, trivial mitral regurgitation and focal hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls of the left ventricle.
She was pancultured and started on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia consistent with a borderline chest x-ray.
Gram stain showed 4+ gram positive cocci and 2+ gram negative rods.
She, however, remained agitated and somewhat sedated postextubation.
The patient was found to have liver function tests within normal limits except for borderline elevated AST 78, ALT 52.
