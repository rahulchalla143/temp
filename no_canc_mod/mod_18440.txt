Admission Date:  [**2189-11-26**]              Discharge Date:   [**2189-12-4**]  Date of Birth:  [**2108-5-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**] Chief Complaint: Tx from OSH for Anterolateral [**First Name3 (LF) **]  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Coronary catheterization   History of Present Illness: 81 yo male with h/o CABG x 2 (SVG jump graft to distal RCA and circumflex and LIMA-LAD), PPM, ICD, CHF with EF 20% transferred from OSH for anterolateral [**First Name3 (LF) **].
The patient presented to OSH with 2 days unstable angina and had ST elevations on ECG (V1-V4) with ST depressions (V5-V6).
He had elevated filling pressures but IABP was no placed because of advanced age and iliac tortuosity.

He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, but negative for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2189-11-26**] demonstrated: Coronary Angiography: Codominant LMCA: LAD: 100% origin LCX: 100% proximal RCA: 100% proximal SVG- jump graft to distal RCA and circumflex widely patent, vein to diagonal with 99% mid stenosis LIMA-LAD: atretic and not clear if used as conduit .
Some slow flow after intevetnio which improved with IC vasodilators.
Distal protection with Filterwire used for predilation but was not able to be used during stenting because of technical problems.
TTE ([**2189-11-27**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild apical aneurysm..
There is moderate to severe regional systolic dysfunction including hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior wall and basal septum and basal anterior walls as well as akinesis of the more distal segments of the inferior wall, septum and anterior wall.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-27**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with cavity enlargement/aneurysm and extensive regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Moderate-severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
There has been interval improvement of now mild pulmonary edema with mild vascular engorgement.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
Bilateral pleural effusions have increased in size in moderate amount, right greater than left.
Increasing bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right and probably loculated on the left.
There has been interval decrease to the right pleural effusion which is small now, and no change to moderate left pleural effusion with loculation.
No pneumothorax or new pulmonary infiltrates are seen.
No evidence of congestive heart failure is seen.
IMPRESSION:  Decrease in right pleural effusion and no change to left pleural effusion and loculation.
No evidence of overt CHF .
Urine cytology ([**11-26**]):Rare highly atypical but degenerated urothelial cells, cannot exclude urothelial dysplasia versus neoplasia.
He had elevated filling pressures but IABP was no placed because of advanced age and iliac tortuosity.
Soon thereafter pt was re-started on metoprolol, likley too soon since pt had dyspnea and CI again <2 (1.78).
Pt has a very tenuous volume status and had several episodes of hypotension during the diuresis and uptitration of BB on the floor after having been transferred to the floor on HOD#4.
CXR revealed bil pleural effusions and a loculated collection on the L but pt was on room air and with good O2 sats on the floor.
Imdur was never restarted since he did not have any angina.
Diuresis for the ccute on Chronic systolic heart failure was done with IV lasix on top of his home dose of 40mg po lasix.
Echo revealed symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with cavity enlargement/aneurysm and extensive regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.
In addition, pt was kept on heparin sq while INR was subtherpeutic for DVT prophylaxis, but when INR >2, this can be discontinued.
For his anterolateral [**Name (NI) **] pt was continued on aggrastat for 18hrs post-intervention, and continued on [**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], statin.
Since pt was started on warfarin pt was felt to be a increased bleeding risk; the plan was therefore to keep [**First Name3 (LF) 4532**] 75 for a total minimum of [**3-1**] weeks, then discontinue, low dose [**Date Range **] 81mg in order to minimize adverse bleeding events.
Pt remained CP free post intervention.
In the CCU pt was noted to have a tachyarrhythmia after the intervention that was consistent with MAT vs. EAT vs. afib vs. a junctional escape rhythm.
The abnormal rhythm was thought likely due to ischemia during the cardiac event and the adrenergic surge that ensued, but most likely pt has some atrial enlargement making him susceptible.
For the loculated pleural effusion IP was curbsided.
The recommended at follow-up CXR in [**2-28**] weeks or if symptoms (SOB or fevers) occur in the interval period then a CXR +/- CT scan should be done.
When arriving pt also had frank hematuria [**2-27**] traumatic foley and anticoagulation.
Cytology was sent wih results of "Rare highly atypical but degenerated urothelial cells, cannot exclude urothelial dysplasia versus neoplasia.
This result is difficult to interpret in the setting of frank hematuria [**2-27**] trauma and should therefore be repeated as an outpt 2-3 weeks out.
If chest pain does not resolve pls call 911.
