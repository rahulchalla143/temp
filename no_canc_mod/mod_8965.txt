Admission Date:  [**2118-6-25**]              Discharge Date:   [**2118-7-7**]   Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Metolazone Analogues  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 41017**] Chief Complaint: Rectal bleeding  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Blood transfusion Intubation Central line placement Upper endoscopy   History of Present Illness: This is an 81 year-old female with history of coronary artery disease status for CABG, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, chronic renal disease who was admitted with a GI bleed.
She noted noted increased fatigue and lethargy several days prior to admission.
The day prior to admission, she had several episodes of maroon colored diarrhea.
She had mild nausea without vomiting.
She also noted light-headedness with standing.
She denied fevers, chills, chest pain, or shortness of breath.
Type II diabetes on oral hypoglycemic agents 2.
Coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**2107**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to RCA).
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%.
Atrial fibrillation on coumadin.
Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine 1.6-1.9.
Peripheral vascular disease bypass surgery bilaterally and later had below the knee amputation on the right ([**7-11**]) and stent to left bypass graft ([**3-14**]).
Anemia with baseline hematocrit 28-32.
History of diverticulosis 12.
History of internal hemorrhoids.
Family History: Her father had diabetes and coronary artery disease.
Physical Exam: Vitals: Temperature:96.7 Blood Pressure:110/60 Pulse:50 Respiratory rate:18 Oxygen Saturation:100% on room air General: Thin elderly female, pleasant, in no acute distress.
HEENT: epicanthal tear to right eye, pupils equal and reactive, extraoccular movements intact, slightly dry mucous membranes.
Extremities: Cool left lower extremities without edema, right below the knee amputation, 4 cm hematoma on dorsum on left hand.
Chest x-ray: Cardiomegally.
No evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
Left hand x-ray: Soft tissue swelling without evidence of fracture or dislocation.
Brief Hospital Course: This is an 81 year-old female with history of coronary artery disease status for CABG, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, chronic renal disease who was admitted with a GI bleed.
Given a negative lavage, she was presumed to have a lower bleed such as a diverticular bleed.
On arrival to the intensive care unit, she became unresponsive and hypotensive to the 60s systolic.
She later underwent an upper endoscopy that showed gastritis without any obvious bleeding source.
A chest x-ray demonstarted fluid overload from her aggressive fluid ressucitation.
She was also found to have a pneumonia with MRSA and M. catarrhalis growing in her sputum.
Coronary artery disease: She has known severe disease.
On arrival to the intensive care unit, she was found to have inferior ischemic changes on EKG.
These changes were transient and likely secondary to demand ischemia.
Hypotension: Her hypotension, was secondary to hemorrhage and hypovolemia.
Congestive heart failure: She became overloaded in setting of transfusion and fluid resuscitation.
Her metoprolol, lisinopril, and digoxin were held given bradycardia and renal dysfunction.
A transthoracic echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 20% and was unchanged from prior studies with the exception of increased pericardial effusion (pulsus was 8).
Acute on chronic renal failure: Her creatinine was elevated above her baseline of 1.6-1.9 on admission.
This was likely secondary to hypoperfusion in the setting of hypovolemia.
Peripheral vascular disease: She had no acute issues during this admission.
Artificial Tear with Lanolin 0.1-0.1 % Ointment Sig: One (1) Appl Ophthalmic  PRN (as needed).
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: GI bleed Pneumonia Congestive heart failure Coronary artery disease Atrial fibrillation Acute on chronic renal failure Diabetes   Discharge Condition: Stable.
She remained hemodyamically stable with no further evidence of bleeding.
Seek medical attention if you have any more red stool or if you have chest pain, shortnes of breath, fevers, chills, lightheadedness, or anything else that you find worrisome.
