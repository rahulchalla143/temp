Admission Date:  [**2117-12-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2117-12-25**]  Date of Birth:                    Sex:  M  Service:  Medicine  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 68 year old male who presented to an outside hospital, [**Hospital **] [**Hospital3 **] on [**2117-12-12**] feeling, weak, fatigued and short of breath.
[**Name2 (NI) **] was then awoke but had another questionable unresponsive episode when he was found by emergency medical services.
An electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST changes.
He had some neurologic changes, questionable for seizure.
Therefore, he was sent for a head computerized tomography scan.
At that point he was revived but intubated secondary to congestive heart failure.
Subsequently he was noted to have a non-Q wave myocardial infarction with a peak troponin of 4.9, creatinine kinase 867.
He had a cardiac catheterization on [**12-17**] showing three vessel disease with proximal lesions of the left anterior descending, left circumflex and right coronary artery with a global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of approximately 30%.
The patient was the maintained on Lasix, Nitroglycerin drip and heparin and transferred to the [**Hospital6 649**] for a coronary artery bypass graft.
Prior to the coronary artery bypass graft the patient also developed a fever which was thought to be due to a urinary tract infection as well as a pneumonia and urine growing greater than 100,000 Escherichia coli.
Chest x-ray showed a right middle lobe infiltrate.
At [**Hospital6 256**] the patient presented with a low-grade fever, still slight leukocytosis and hypoxia to 83% on room air, improving to 96% on 4 liters.
He was thus transferred to Medicine for treatment of pneumonia urinary tract infection, congestive heart failure and acute renal failure prior to coronary artery bypass graft.
Diabetes mellitus; 2.
Chronic renal insufficiency with acute renal insufficiency.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
On examination this is a well-appearing although slightly pale elderly male in no acute distress.
There was no jugulovenous distension visible.
His heart was regular rate and rhythm without any evidence of murmurs, rubs or gallops.
He had dry rales bilaterally, right greater than left, approximately half way up on the right and one-third of the way up the lung on the left side.
There was minimal lower extremity edema noted.
The patient had a nasal cannula in place.
His abdomen was soft, no tenderness to palpation.
His urinalysis was negative for any evidence of urinary tract infection.
Liver function tests had a slight increase of ALT to 105 and AST at 61.
Chest x-ray was done which showed evidence of congestive heart failure with bilateral effusions and increased vascularity and evidence of pulmonary edema.
On a repeat urinalysis it did show 21 to 50 red blood cells but negative for urinary tract infection and urine cultures were negative.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 68 year old male with a history of diabetes and question of coronary artery disease presented to [**Hospital6 256**] status post acute myocardial infarction with three vessel disease on a diagnostic catheterization at an outside hospital, also congestive heart failure with likely pneumonia and urinary tract infection, acute and chronic renal failure, awaiting coronary artery bypass graft after resolution of his medical issues.
Per the patient's hypoxia it was deemed mostly to be due to his congestive heart failure as there was no evidence of pneumonia at the time of his presentation to [**Hospital6 1760**].
The hypoxia subsequently resolved and at the time of transfer for his coronary artery bypass graft the patient had an oxygen saturation of 93 to 94% on room air.
For the question of pneumonia on top of this, causing possible hypoxia, the patient was continued on Levaquin for a seven day course with complete clinical resolution.
As far as his overall infectious disease issues, the patient had clinical resolution of both his urinary tract infection and pneumonia with a seven day course of Levaquin, not restarted on any other antibiotics.
For his coronary artery disease, the patient was kept on Metoprolol and Nitroglycerin drip, heparin drip and statins, and awaiting coronary artery bypass graft for bypass of the coronary artery lesion.
For his acute and chronic renal insufficiency, renal consultation was obtained.
Their feeling was that this was likely acute tubular necrosis with possible also glomerulonephritis.
The acute tubular necrosis was resolving with stabilized creatinine of approximately 2.3.
As far as the glomerulonephritis portion of it, the feeling was that it was due to either diabetic or IgA nephritis.
In addition for his microscopic hematuria, possibly due to either glomerulonephritis or some sort of lesion within the bladder or urinary tract infection for which the patient should also have outpatient Urology follow up.
On hospital day #7, the patient developed a temporary acute esophageal obstruction from a food bolus.
According to the patient he has had a progressive two year history of dysphagia, although this is the first time he ever had an acute esophageal obstruction by which he was not able to swallow his saliva nor any fluids.
According to Gastroenterology the patient should have an outpatient gastroenterology follow up or likely upper endoscopy and should continue on a proton pump inhibitor for likely gastroesophageal reflux and prevention of any possible strictures.
On transfer, to Cardiothoracic Surgery for the coronary artery bypass graft, it was the opinion of the medical team that this patient will require follow ups after his discharged from the hospital.
Nephrology for follow up of his acute and chronic renal failure.
Urology for his microscopic hematuria.
Gastroenterology for his progressive dysphagia, episode of esophageal obstruction.
Other recommendations will be left to the Cardiothoracic Surgery Team who will be taking care of the patient for his coronary artery bypass graft.
