EKG was NSR with new TWI V1-V3, Trop 0.11.
The patient was noted to have his O2 sat drop to 70s on room air when sleeping and thus there was concern so admitted to MICU for closer monitoring.

[**2125-2-12**]: Stool Positive for C Diff toxin.
[**2125-2-15**]: Ova and parasites neg Urine Culture [**2-17**] negative, [**2-21**] pending Blood Culture [**2-11**], [**2-14**], [**2-15**] negative .
CT C-SPINE: ([**2125-2-11**]) No evidence of acute fracture or acute misalignment of the cervical spine on the background of severe degenerative change as described above.
A few foci of air in the visualized soft tissues may be within the venous structures or subcutaneous tissues related to intravenous injection or trauma.
In case of clinical concern for underlying severe injury or infection, a chest CT can be obtained to evaluate the extent of this gas.
Partially imaged areas of ground-glass opacity in bilateral lung apices.
Mild subcutaneous soft tissue edema.
In case of clinical concern for cord or ligamentous injury, an MRI of the cervical spine is suggested.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: ([**2125-2-11**])  There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation abnormality.
Multiple focal areas of hypodensity in the subcortical, periventricular, and subinsular region are most compatible with chronic ischemic small vessel disease.
Prominence of the ventricles and cerebral sulci are most compatible with age-appropriate volume loss.
Intracranial arterial calcifications especially in the carotid arteries are noted.
There is no evidence of fracture.
There is mild to moderate mucosal thickening in bilateral frontal and ethmoid sinus air cells.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
Mucosal sinus disease .
CT Abd/Pelvis [**2125-2-19**]: The evaluation is limited without intravenous contrast.
At the lung bases, small-to-moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis have increased in size.
Contrast is seen within the distal esophagus and there is a moderate-sized hiatal hernia.
There are multiple hypo- and hyper-dense lesions within both kidneys.
The largest is an exophytic hypodense lesion measuring 4.4 x 4.2 cm arising off the lower pole of the left kidney.
Additional hyperdense lesions are not characterized on this examination and are best evaluated on the renal ultrasound of [**2125-2-13**].
A small 3-mm focus of soft tissue attenuation is seen in the right upper quadrant, adjacent to the region of the anterior gallbladder wall and the peritoneum.
Abdominal loops of small bowel appear unremarkable.
The amount of intra-abdominal ascites continues to increase.
There is an infrarenal IVC filter which appears collapsed.
There is no pneumoperitoneum or pneumatosis.
There is persistent wall thickening of the transverse, descending and sigmoid colon.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is extensive sigmoid diverticulosis with wall thickening, which is unchanged.
There is a small amount of fluid within the pelvis.
There are extensive degenerative changes of the lumbar spine with marked S-shaped rotary scoliosis.
Degenerative changes are also seen in both hips.
On the left, there is cortical and trabecular thickening consistent with Paget's disease.
Increased bilateral pleural effusions and ascites.
Persistent transverse, descending and sigmoid colonic wall thickening, likely secondary to known C. difficile colitis.
Bilateral renal cysts, some of which appear hyperdense, but are better characterized on recent ultrasound.
Moderate sized hiatal hernia.
CXR PA and Lateral [**2125-2-21**]: Evaluation of patient with leukocytosis and history of prior pleural effusion.
Bibasal atelectasis had progressed in the interim with most likely interval increase in bilateral pleural effusion.
KUB [**2125-2-21**]: FINDINGS: There is a moderate amount of contrast seen throughout the stomach, duodenum and small bowel that is likely related to recent prior video oropharyngeal swallowing examination.
There is questionable bowel thickening of the duodenem, could be related to collapsed appearance.
The bowel gas pattern is otherwise unremarkable with no dilated loops of colon to suggest megacolon.
No evidence of pneumoperitoneum.
No soft tissue calcification or radiopaque foreign bodies.
Note is made of dextroscoliosis centered about the L3 vertebral body and IVC filter.
Significant amount of retained contrast seen within the small bowel and stomach likely related to recent video oropharyngeal swallowing study.
Portable KUB [**2125-2-22**]: A moderate amount of contrast is present throughout the colon and rectum, likely related to recent video swallowing study.
Loops of colon are well opacified with no evidence of megacolon.
There is no pneumoperitoneum.
There is no acute fracture or dislocation.
Brief Hospital Course: 89 y/o gentleman w/DM2, HTN, CRI, Rheumatoid arthritis initially admitted to the ICU with diarrhea leading to hypotension/hypoxia.
Labs were notable a leukocytosis of 17.4 and ARF with Cr 2.8 (up from baseline 1.3).
Early [**2-28**], patient was noted to be difficult to rouse, with worsening hypotension and unattainable temperature.
She relayed that she didn't want anything that would be painful or cause discomfort.
No further central venous lines, arterial lines or other invasive procedures were performed.
