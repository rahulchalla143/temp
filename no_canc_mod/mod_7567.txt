He complained of pain at the site of his saccral decubitis.
Denied shortness of breath.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
STEMI was medically managed with heparin, plavix, asa, statin, ECHO showed newly depressed EF to 25% with wide LV hypokinesis.
He grew VRE from blood and urine and was treated with daptomycin, meropenem and linezolid.
He was intubated for increased work of breathing and treated for heart failure and VAP however the MICU team was unable wean him off of the vent, he is s/p trach and PEG.
Hospital course was also complicated by pulseless VT x4 managed with synchronized cardioversion and amiodarone.
Goals of care at end of hospital course were DNR, do not escalate care   Past Medical History: Ventilator dependent last vent settings PSV 12/5 ATC 40% Fio2 Coronary Artery Disease c/b STEMI [**4-/2131**] medically managed Ventricular tachycardia s/p cardioversion Ischemic cardiomyopathy LVEF 25% [**4-/2131**] Erosive esophagitis c/b recurrent GI bleeds Bilateral CEA Diabetes mellitus Sacral Decubitis BL heel pressure ulcers Chronic kidney disease baseline creatinine 1.4-1.6 PVD: mild-moderate aorto-[**Hospital1 **]-ilac disease as noted in [**2119**] GERD Colonic polyps VRE UTI MRSA Pneuomonia Hyperlipidemia Macular Degeneration Chronic back/leg pain secondary to DJD Essential Tremor Peripheral Neuropathy s/p Left and Right Total hip replacements COPD Depression  Social History: Denies current tobacco use (h/o 20+ pack year, quit 15-20 years ago) Admits to approximately 2+ beers most nights of the week.

Interval placement of right internal jugular central venous catheter terminating in the proximal to mid SVC, without evidence of pneumothorax.
Bilateral layering pleural effusions, increased, with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation not excluded.
Additional peripheral right upper lobe patchy opacity may be due to additional site of infection and/or aspiration.
[**5-21**] TTE The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %) secondary to akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls, and hypokinesis of the interventricular septum.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
[In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-4-9**], there has been marked progression of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation (both of the functional ischemic classification) consistent with the natural history of this patient's recently documented untreated extensive inferior posterior and right ventricular myocardial infarction.
Brief Hospital Course: HOSPITAL COURSE 66yo chronically-ventilated M PMH recent STEMI, ischemic cardiomyopathy LEVF 25%, errosive gastritis, a/w slow upper gastrointestinal bleed and PNA, bleeding stabilized without surgical/endoscopic intervention, started on high-dose cefepime for MDR psuedomonal PNA, clinical status improving with patient discharged to ECF.
ACTIVE # GI Bleed: Patient w h/o errosive gastritis on EGD [**2-/2131**], who presented w downtrending HCT (30 to 20.9), guaiac + stool.
# Respiratory Failure [**3-7**] PNA and Chronic Systolic CHF: Ventilator dependent patient [**3-7**] MRSA pneumonia [**4-/2131**] and heart failure, with pulmonary infiltrates on admission.
Sputum grew out psuedomonas with sensitivities demonstrating carbapenem resistance.
# Coronary artery disease c/b ischemic cardiomyopathy: Patient with recent STEMI [**4-/2131**] that was medically managed (given his prior bleeds) with ASA, plavix, and a statin, who was w/o signs ischemia on admission, but w signs c/w worsening failure.
Given some hypotension on admission, metoprolol dosing was decreased.
# Thrombocytopenia: Patient continued to have thrombocytopenia on this admission.
# Sacral decubitis: Patient with deep sacral decubitis, bilateral heel ulcers.
Transition of Care: Patient discharged to [**Hospital1 **], with follow-up planned with heart failure clinic.
Barriers to Care: Recurrent GI bleeds have had major effect on patient management (rehospitalizations, inability to manage STEMI w cath), and may necessitate recurrent transfusions or future readmissions  Medications on Admission: acetaminophen 650 mg/20.3 mL Oral Soln Q6H PRN albuterol sulfate HFA 90 mcg 6 puffs Q6-8 hrs PRN amiodarone 400 mg daily ascorbic acid 500 mg daily atorvastatin 80 mg Daily Chlorhexedine 0.12% 12mL Q12H Diphenhydramine 25mg Q4H PRN itching Diphenhydramine cream 1appl Q8H PRN Docusate 100mg [**Hospital1 **] Glucerna 1.2 tube feed 75ml/H furosemide 80 mg IV BID collnaagese clostridium histolyticum 250 unit/g Ointment Topical [**Hospital1 **] insulin glargine 14 QHS insulin regular Sliding scale Ipratropium/Albuterol 3mL Q2H PRN Lorazepam 1mg Q8H PRN metoprolol tartrate 75 mg Q8H pantoprazole 40 mg IV BID sucralfate 1 gram 4x daily Polyethylene glycol 17g daily free water 200cc Q6H  Discharge Medications: 1. amiodarone 200 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).

You were admitted with decreasing blood levels, likely due to bleeding from your gastrointestinal tract.
We discussed your care with gastroenterologists who felt that you did not need to have an endoscopy as long as your blood levels remained stable.
Given your recent history of a heart attack and heart failure, we discussed your case with cardiologists, who felt that certain medications should be started to help your heart function.
You were found to have a pneumonia with a very resistant bacteria called psuedomonas.
