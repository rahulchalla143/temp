The patient presented to the OSH 2 days prior to transfer after waking up with resp distress and looking cyanotic to his girlfriend.
He was intubated at the OSH and had a large aspiration event at the time (received etomidate 25mg IV and succinochline 200mg IV).
Given his fevers and elevated WBC count on admission (WBC = 14.9), he was started on vancomycin, imipenom, and levofloxacin to broadly cover for pneumonia.
CXR revealed large left sided aspiration PNA.
He was also found to be in acute renal failure at the time of admission with a creatinine of 1.7 with a K of 6.0.
He was followed by the renal service at the OSH and it was felt to be either pre-renal azotemia or ATN.
Cardiology was consulted and did not think this was a primary cardiac event, but secondary to possible hypotension and pulmonary insults.
Given his continued respiratory failure and multiorgan system failure, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on the evening of [**2191-11-4**].
A CXR was obtained that showed LLL collapse and left sided infiltrate.
His broad spectrum antibiotics were continued and he was started on steroids for possible asthma exacerbation.
Also, the patient was found to have an elevated potassium thgouth due to both his ARF and acidosis.
An EKG did not show evidence of peaked t waves.

He was intubated and found to have large aspiration PNA.
Presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with multiorgan system failure and difficult to oxygenate despite mechanical ventilation.
The thought was that he had a severe aspiration PNA.
A bronch was not performed given the high oxygen requirements (he had been bronched at the OSH where they saw secretions but no evidence of hemorrhage).
Given HIT and elevated heart pressures, there was some concern for PE.
Unable to get CTA given ARF, so he was started on agatroban upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] for empiric therapy.
He was given broad spectrum antibiotics vancomycin/zosyn/cipro for empiric coverage.
A routine CXR that night showed a right pneumothorax.
He was hypotensive and he was given IVF and placed on 3 pressor agents.
# ARF - on admission to the OSH patient had a creatinine of 1.7. unknown what his baseline was.
Etiologies could be pre-renal with hypotension v. ATN v. ?
Renal consult felt this was likely ATN.
# Thrombocytopenia/HIT - h/o HIT + antibodies in [**January 2191**], was on coumadin for unknown period of time.
Likely in the setting of hypotension and poor oxygenation.
It showed at least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
No ASD/PFO seen.
Dilated RV with preserved RV systolic function.
# Liver Failure - likely shock liver.
# Fever/Elevated WBC - patient with elevated WBC on arrival to the ED prior to the aspiration event.
