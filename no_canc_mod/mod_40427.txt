Admission Date:  [**2163-3-23**]              Discharge Date:   [**2163-4-5**]  Date of Birth:  [**2090-1-9**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30201**] Chief Complaint: chest pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: none  History of Present Illness: 73 y.o.
woman w/ PMH significant for DM, ESRD, initially presenting from dialysis w/ substernal chest pain.
The pain felt tight, like pressure in the middle of her chest.
It was not associated with radiation to her arms or jaw, was not associated with nausea, or diaphoresis.
The patient reports having this pain frequently, however, she reports never having been hospitalized for the pain.
Apparently, the patient is sensitive to fluid shifts given her HOCM, and this is the precipitant of her chest pain.
Her chest pain is non-exertional in nature.
She reports having a productive cough, without hemoptysis.
She denies palpitations, lightheadedness, or headache.
She denies brbpr, or melena.
ekg showed ST depressions.
Her pain resolved.
Past Medical History: PMH: - Hypertension - Diabetes - Peripheral vascular disease status post bilateral knee amputations in [**2146**] (L) and [**2157**] (R) - GERD - Hypercholesterolemia - ESRD on hemodialysis M,W,F.
- Paroxysmal atrial flutter, s/p failed ablation - Peptic ulcer disease - Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy - Mild mitral stenosis (MVA 1.5-2.0 cm2) - Secondary Hyperparathyroidism .
PSurgH: - Peripheral vascular disease status post bilateral knee amputations in [**2146**] (L) and [**2157**] (R)  Social History: Social history is significant for the presence of current tobacco use (1 pack per week), and [**12-22**] PPD x 50 years.
Lives in [**Hospital3 **] facility and uses a mobile wheelchair or a walker.
HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL, left pupil unresponsive EOMI without nystagmus, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in OP  Neck: supple, no JVD or carotid bruits appreciated Pulmonary: Lungs crackles at bases bilaterally Cardiac: irregular, nl.
3/6 systolic murmur at RUSB.
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
radial pulse 2+ b/l Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.
Able to relate history without difficulty.
No abnormal movements noted.
Rib Films ([**2163-3-30**]) No fracture.
Right-sided PICC unchanged.
Echo ([**2163-3-24**])The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is moderate functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 9 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe symmetric LVH with a small cavity and hyperdynamic systolic function.
Moderate functional mitral stenosis.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Head CT ([**2163-4-4**]) FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, or major vascular territorial infarction.
Periventricular [**Known lastname **] matter hypodensities are consistent with mildly severe small vessel ischemic disease.
A hyperdensity in the left frontal lobe in the suprasellar region may represent partial volume averaging or a small meningioma.
A punctate calcification along the sulci in the right parietal region is unchanged.
There is no fracture.
The visualized paranasal sinuses and the mastoid air cells are well aerated.
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Mildly severe small vessel ischemic disease.
Hyperdensity in the left frontal lobe in the suprasellar region may represent partial volume averaging versus a small meningioma.
She has had this pain before and was recently admitted for CP.
This pain has been attributed to her HOCM due to fluid shifts during her dialysis.
02 96% on 5L NC and lungs with crackles per report.
She then quickly developed more difficulty breathing and became somnolent.
She subsequently became more somnolent and became bradycardic.
She lost per pulse and PEA arrest was called.
Pt was also given CaCL, HC03, insulin/D50 for presumed hyperkalemia given previous K 5.6 (hemolyzed).
The precise cause of her respiratory failure and PEA arrest were unable to be determined, although fluid shifts related to HD, perhaps with associated metabolic derrangments were strongly suspected.
Hypertension: The pt required IV labetalol for hypertensive urgency twice during her admission, however her BP stabilized as her overall status improved.
Obstructive cardiomyopathy: An echo performed during the pt's admission confirmed mild to moderate resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
This was attributed to long-standing hypertensive heart disease.
Caution should used in giving the patient agents that will reduce pre-load or afterload as doing this may worsen the patient's outflow tract obstruction.
Chest Pain: The pt complained of very frequent chest and arm discomfort during much of her hospital stay.
Her initial chest pain was thought to be related to her obstructive cardiac physiology.
Multiple ECGs were checked and did not show abnormalities compared to baseline; she was ruled out for MI at the beginning of her course by biomarkers.
Following her cardiac arrest, which included chest compressions, the patient developed more persistent central, non-radiating chest pain that was worse with movement.
The chest pain was reproducible on exam.
It is thought that the pain is musculoskeletal in origin from the trauma sustained during the chest compressions.
Rib films were negative for fracture.
The pt had some relief with Tylenol, though low dose oxycodone was more effective.
Mental status changes: The pt was noted by providers and family members to be slightly off her mental baseline.
A head CT was obtained on the day prior to discharge which showed small vessel ischemic changes but no acute findings.
At future HD sessions, the pt be premedicated with beta blocker and will not have more than 1 kg of fluid removed to help maintain her hemodynamics in the setting of her obstructive cardiac physiology.
Albuterol Sulfate 0.63 mg/3 mL Solution for Nebulization Sig: One (1) neb Inhalation every six (6) hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing.
Warfarin 3 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day: ***This medication was being held at the time of discharge due to an elevated INR.***.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Health Care - [**Hospital1 **]  Discharge Diagnosis: hypertension kidney disease on dialysis hypercholesterolemia GERD peripheral vascular disease glaucoma atrial flutter diabetes s/p cardiac arrest   Discharge Condition: Vitals stable, improved overall.
Testing has not identified a precise cause for this, however we do not believe it due to a problem with your heart.
You underwent CPR and were on a breathing machine for a short period.
Following the CPR, you developed more persistent chest pain, which we think was due to the chest compressions.
Again, there was not clear evidence for a heart attack as the cause of your pain.
Also seek medical attention if you develop any new fever, chills, trouble breathing, chest pain, nausea, vomiting or unusual stools.
