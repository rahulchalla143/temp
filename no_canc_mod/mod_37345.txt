History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old female with morbid obesity, obesity-hypoventilation syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea complicated by pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale who is presenting with worsening volume overload in the past two weeks.
She also has a history of polyarticular gout, recently on prednisone taper, and chronic renal insufficiency.
Ms [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 60251**] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2126-11-28**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation and tracheostomy.
Her current admission was prompted after a routine visit to her PCP; she was sent to the ED for worsening volume overload.
In the ED, she had transient and questionable hypotension to 80s systolic with immediate improvement without intervention.
Her pulmonary hypertension is multifactorial - she has a history of Fen-Phen use in the past; she also has obstructive sleep apnea which was previously managed by CPAP.
Recently, she was diagnosed with a DVT in her right upper extremity; she has been on coumadin and lovenox bridge - however it seems according to the last pulmonary note coumadin is being held until tracheostomy tube is changed in early [**Month (only) 116**].
She is also complaining of joint pain in her left ankle especially; she has a history of polyarticular gout affecting sacroiliac joints, PIPs, ankles on recent prednisone taper.
Her lasix dose at home is 20 mg daily; she reports being compliant with a gradual increase in lower extremity swelling and pain over the past couple months.
She is coughing up clearish sputum, but denies feeling much more short of breath than normal; denies orthopnea, chest pain, chest pressure, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
Not ambulating at rehab given pain in her ankles.

Right ventricular cavity dilation with free wall hypokinesis.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Normal left ventricular cavity size and global systolic function.
No intracardiac shunt suggested at rest.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-12-3**], the estimated PA systolic pressure is now lower (may not reflect a true change due to suboptimal technical quality of the current study acquired with the patient sitting up in a chair).
No acute intra-abdominal or intrapelvic process.
Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
No bowel obstruction.
Brief Hospital Course: This 61 year old female with a history of pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale secondary to obesity-hypoventilation syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea presents with worsening volume overload.
# hypoxia [**1-30**] OSA, pulmonary HTN, and obesity hypoventilation: Initially the patient was admitted to the MICU.
The patient was initially doing well while on the floor, but she then triggered for hypoxia on the floor and returned to MICU on [**2127-4-25**].
She was placed on a ventilator on the first night as she appeared somnolent and monitored for another night using red cap during the day and passy muir valve at night without any oxygen desaturations.
# volume overload: The etiology of the patient's volume overload is multifactorial, given her history of cardiopulmonary disease.
Given her severe pulmonary hypertension, we repeated her echo with bubble study to look for shunt; no shunt was visualized.
It was held in the setting of her acute renal failure, but once her creat was trending down, Lasix 40 mg daily was restarted.
# acute renal failure:  While in the unit the patient' creat began to rise (1.7).
# back pain:  The patient was complaining of upper back pain and was noted to have an ecchymosis overlying a tender mass.
The hematoma was decreasing in size upon discharge.
# E. coli UTI: The patient completed seven day course of ceftriaxone for her E.coli UTI.
# increased secretions from trach: While in the unit, noted to have increased secretions from trach.
She was noted to have GNRs in culture, likely colonization  # Cor pulmonale/right sided heart failure: Most recent ECHO shows EF >60% with right ventricular cavity dilation with free wall hypokinesis, consistent with her known R sided heart failure in the setting of OSA and pulmonary HTN.
The patient was initially volume overloaded and diuresed as described above.
# L ankle pain:  The patient was complaining of ankle pain; films with evidence of soft tissue swelling.
Her colchicine was held in the setting of her acute renal failure.
-  Given her obesity hypoventilation and high baseline levels of Co2, the pt is a chronic retainer and maintaining O2 sats in the high 80/low 90 range should be her goal in order to preserve her respiratory drive.
Medications on Admission: ALLOPURINOL - 300 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily in combination with 100 mg tablet for total of 400 mg daily ALLOPURINOL - 100 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily in combination with 300 mg daily for total of 400 mg BIPAP - - as directed for sleep apnea COMMODE - - For home use.
