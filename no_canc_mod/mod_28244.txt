Admission Date: [**2200-8-26**]        Discharge Date: [**2200-8-28**]  Date of Birth:  [**2200-8-26**]        Sex:  M  Service:  NB  ID: Baby [**Name (NI) **] ([**Known lastname **]) [**Known lastname 63338**] is a 6 day old term infant with history of desaturation episodes who is being discharged from the [**Hospital1 18**] NICU.
The pregnancy was complicated by mild maternal hypertension.
Intrapartum course was notable for spontaneous rupture of membranes 8 hours prior to delivery, no maternal fever or other noted sepsis risk factors, and late fetal heart rate decelerations prompted a vacuum assisted vaginal delivery.
The infant emerged with poor tone and poor respiratory effort, but improved with blow by oxygen and stimulation.
He was brought to the newborn intensive care unit because of respiratory distress.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A full-term, large for gestational age infant with moderate grunting and retracting.
Capillary refill mildly sluggish.
Significant molding with left parietal occipital caput.
Coarse breath sounds.
ABDOMEN: Soft and nontender.
Three-vessel umbilical cord.
His respiratory symptoms resolved in 24 hours, consistent with transient tachypnea of the newborn.
He was noted, however, to have intermittent episodes of desaturations at rest, associated with periodic/shallow breathing, at first requiring stimulation but then spontaneously resolving.
He also had mild desaturations associated with some feedings.
These episodes gradually improved; by the time of discharge, he had had no desaturations at rest for over 4 days, and no desaturations with feedings for over 36 hours.
Remainder of exam was reassuring, and a head CT was performed which was negative (see below).
There are no cardiovascular issues.
Initial mild discoordination resulting in mild desaturations improved and had resolved by the time of discharge.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE: [**Known lastname **] was started on ampicillin and gentamycin at the time of admission for sepsis risk factors.
NEUROLOGY: A head CT scan was performed on [**2200-8-28**], to assess for intracranial hemorrhage given the episodes of desaturation and history of vacuum assisted delivery.
The CT scan was within normal limits without evidence of hemorrhage.
RECOMMENDATIONS AFTER DISCHARGE:  Medications - he is discharged on no medications.
C. With chronic lung disease.
Before    this age and for the first 24 months of the child's life,    immunization against influenza is recommended for    household contacts and out of home caregivers.
Status post transitional respiratory distress (TTN).
Desaturation episodes.
