[**2149-6-30**] Carotid Ultrasound Findings consistent with a 60-69% right ICA stenosis and less than 40% left ICA stenosis.
The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior akinesis.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2).
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
The patient is status post sternotomy, with prosthetic valve and multiple mediastinal clips.
There is moderately severe cardiomegaly.
There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.
There is opacification at the right base, which likely represents combination of pleural fluid and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
There is increased density in the retrocardiac region, but compared with [**2149-6-27**], the left hemidiaphragm is now visible, suggesting partial interval clearing.
DR. [**Known firstname **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4343**]    Brief Hospital Course: 80 year old woman with known aortic stenosis admitted to cardiac surgery service for aortic valve replacement with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] on [**2149-6-25**].
She was hemodynamically labile in early post-op course and when she was allowed to wake she droped her cardiac indices.
On postoperative day two, the patient was noted to be somewhat oliguric and was treated with diuretics, additionally she required Bipap after an episode of tachypnea and remained in the ICU for aggressive pulmonary toilet and to monitor her response to diuretics.
She remained in atrial fibrillation consistent with her preoperative rhythm.
Plavix and aspirin were continued for anticoagulatuion for her atrial fibrillation as per preoperatively.
She complained of some right sided weakness for which a neurology consult was obtained.
A head CT scan and carotid duplex ultrasound were negative  for an acute process.
