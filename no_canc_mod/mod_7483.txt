HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 29201**] is a pleasant 68-year-old male with known three vessel coronary artery disease since a cardiac catheterization in [**2132**].
He reports that he has discomfort in his chest on exertion approximately one to two times per week, which is relieved by rest.
He was found to have a positive result on a stress test done in [**9-17**].
Coronary artery disease.
ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
His cardiac examination shows a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs.
He has no hepatosplenomegaly, and no other palpable masses.
His extremities are warm, dry, and well perfused, with no varicosities.
On pulse exam, he has 2+ palpable radial femoral and popliteal artery pulses bilaterally, and 1+ palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial artery pulses bilaterally.
EKG showed sinus rhythm.
Chest x-ray showed only degenerative changes of the thoracic spine with no other noted abnormalities.
At this time, he was found to have severe three vessel disease with 100% occlusion of the mid LAD, 100% occlusion of the mid circumflex, and 100% occlusion at the mid right coronary artery.
In summary, he had a left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery graft, as well as saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal I and obtuse marginal II, as well as the posterior descending artery.
He, subsequently, went into atrial fibrillation and his blood pressure dropped to the 60's systolic.
This did not respond to two liters of lactated Ringer's and fluid boluses or raising his Neo-Synephrine drip to 2.5 mcg and weaning off his propofol.
On postoperative day number zero, Mr. [**Known lastname 29201**] continued to have a high chest tube output, being in atrial fibrillation, had a drop in cardiac index.
He was also cardioverted, at this time, due to a low cardiac index while in atrial fibrillation, to which he converted to sinus rhythm and improved his cardiac index to back above 2.
He continued to be on an amiodarone drip at 0.5 mcg, and maintained sinus rhythm with occasional APC's.
He was being diuresed aggressively and continued to require or have a high oxygen requirement to maintain his oxygen saturations.
His heart showed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs.
His sternal incision was healing nicely with no erythema or drainage.
His extremities were warm and well perfused, showing approximately 1+ peripheral edema in the lower extremities.
