There is trace perisplenic fluid, the spleen is normal.
The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast normally without evidence of hydronephrosis.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is some free fluid in the pelvis.
MUSCULOSKELETAL: There is minimal DJD.
Acute pancreatitis.
Marked peripancreatic fluid without evidence of organization into a focal collection.
No pseudocyst, pancreatic necrosis or pseudoaneurysm is detected.

There is increased retroperitoneal fluid in addition to ascites.
There is a loculated area of fluid in the anterior pararenal space, anterior to the head of the pancreas measuring a maximum of 2.8 cm in diameter.
There is no evidence of biliary dilatation.
There is no evidence of choledocholithiasis.
There is no focal liver lesion.
There is no evidence of adrenal mass.
There is subcutaneous edema.
It is noted that the images are degraded by artifacts, and subtle hepatic lesions for example cannot be excluded.
Acute pancreatitis.
No evidence of choledocholithiasis.
Loculated area of fluid anterior to the head of the pancreas measuring 2.8 cm in maximum diameter.
TTE [**2188-6-10**]: Conclusions The left atrium is mildly dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
No definite evidence of endocarditis.
Minimal aortic stenosis.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Hyperdense interventricular septum indicates underlying anemia.
There is a small left pleural effusion and a tiny right pleural effusion.
Associated atelectatic changes are noted in the surrounding pulmonary parenchyma.
There is a diffuse prominence to the interlobular septa with peripheral nodular opacities seen bilaterally which is likely indicative of fluid overload; however, developing multifocal consolidations is a consideration.
There is underlying mild emphysematous change; however, respiratory motion artifact limits thorough evaluation.
There are numerous mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest seen in prevascular location measuring approximately 16 x 10 mm.
Large area of peripancreatic stranding and inflammatory change is again seen around the pancreas without interval change, allowing for lack of contrast administration.
There is a small fluid collection anterior to the pancreas, as seen on prior study.
There is no developing abscess evident.
Complications such as splenic vein thrombosis, pancreatic necrosis and/or pseudoaneurysm formation are unable to be evaluated on non-contrast study.
No biliary dilatation.
There is a non-obstructing left renal calculus.
Atherosclerotic calcifications are present.
Within the pelvis there is increasing amount of free fluid as compared to study of [**6-3**].
No dilated loops of bowel or peritoneal gas is evident.
Soft tissue anasarca is seen throughout.
No mass or lymphadenopathy.
Prominent pulmonary interstitial markings and scattered bilateral peripheral opacities, small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, and underlying anemia, all most suggestive of fluid overload.
Developing pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded, and continued clinical surveillance will be necessary.
Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a 50 year-old woman s/p cholecystectomy, with a history of depression, fibromyalgia, and recurrent nephrolithiasis who presents with acute pancreatitis.
Her hospital course was complicated by severe ATN due to contrast nephropathy as well as respiratory failure, requiring a period of mechanical ventilation.
These were done to evaluate for evolution of pancreatic abscesses, psuedocysts, or other fluid collections.
She did show a possible area of fluid collection anterior to the head of the pancreas.
This showed no evidence of cholelidolithiasis or dilated biliary ducts but did confirm a loculated area of fluid anterior to the head of the pancreas measuring 2.8 cm in maximum diameter.
The cause of her pancreatitis was never determined.
She had no evidence of gall stones on MRCP.
Her history lacked evidence of alcohol abuse.
However, the patient reportedly described some weight loss on admission.
She was seen by the GI consult team and they did recommend pancreas protocol abdominal imaging in [**3-23**] weeks to assess for a mass lesion.
She advanced to regular diet, though she still experienced some bouts of nausea and vomiting, for which she received Zofran ODT, which she will be discharged with this as a PRN medication.
# Respiratory Failure: The patient was transferred to MICU in setting of hypoxia while on the wards.
Initial hypoxia and respiratory distress thought to either be due PNA vs. ARDs from pancreatitis.
However, there was also likely components of volume overload from her severe ATN as well as decreased ventilatory drive due to opiate-related narcosis from high dose MScontin given for her pancreatitis pain.
She required intubation for hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Given the multiple possible causes of her respiratory failure, she was treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and with ARDS-like ventilation protocol.
Her anti-biotic coverage included broad spectrum antibiotics (Aztreonam, Levofloxacin, and Vancomycin) to cover for a possible HAP.
# Acute renal failure: In setting of receiving two IV contrast studies in a span of 3 days the patient developed rapidly rising creatinine.
It was thought that her renal failure was primarily from acute tubular necrosis due to contrast nephropathy.
# Acute on chronic pain:  Patient has history of fibromyalgia.
On admission, she also complained of pain due to her pancreatitis.
This was discontinued after she became confused and somewhat sedated.
# Enterococcus UTI: Noted from urine culture on admission.
Given PCN allergy, pt was treated with 3 day course of IV vancomycin with subsequent urine cultures with no growth.
# Depression/anxiety - Mrs. [**Doctor Last Name 93973**] has a history of depression and anxiety disorder.
These medications were held upon transfer to the ICU in the setting of acute renal failure and altered mental status.
# Anemia:  Noted to have 3 point Hct drop on day of transfer to MICU.
Initial smear did reveal rare schistocytes which was thought to possibly be [**1-19**] low grade DIC; however, upon repeat peripheral smear review, no schistocytes were visualized.
No signs of GI bleed during hospital course.
Iron studies did show reduced B12 and Fe levels with increased ferritin.
Klonopin 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for anxiety.
Discharge Disposition: Home With Service  Facility: [**Hospital 119**] Homecare  Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY: pancreatitis acute tubular necrosis due to contrast nephropathy respiratory failure  SECONDARY: anxiety and depression acute on chronic pain   Discharge Condition: Good, ambulating, off oxygen.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with acute pancreatitis--the cause of this was not clearly determined.
While hospitalized, you developed acute kidney failure and respiratory failure.
You required support for your breathing with a mechanical ventilator for a few days.
If you develop any fevers, inability to tolerate food/drink, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain or any other concerning symptoms, please call your physician or proceed to the emergency department.
