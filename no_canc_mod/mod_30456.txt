Mineral: [**2129-2-11**] 08:20PM BLOOD Albumin-4.4 Calcium-10.2 Phos-4.6*# Mg-2.2 [**2129-2-14**] 06:30AM BLOOD Albumin-3.9 Calcium-9.3 Phos-5.8* Mg-2.5 [**2129-2-11**] 08:26PM BLOOD Glucose-155* Lactate-2.7* K-4.5 [**2129-2-13**] 07:27AM BLOOD Lactate-2.5* ########################################################## [**2129-2-11**] CXR FINDINGS: There is diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacity throughout both lungs, favoring the lung bases.
The cardiac silhouette has actually decreased significantly in size from the prior exam suggesting a resolved pericardial effusion.
There are bilateral pleural effusions, left slightly greater than right.
No pneumothorax is seen.
The opacity at the medial right lung base may indicate confluent edema or possibly underlying concurrent infection or significant aspiration.
Repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis is recommended to assess for underlying infection.
[**2129-2-12**] CXR FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph from [**3-14**], the signs of bilateral diffuse pulmonary edema have completely resolved.
No remnant focal parenchymal opacities.
No pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = quantitative 44%).
Systolic function of apical segments is relatively preserved.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild global hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.).
Dilated ascending aorta.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-11-18**], global left ventricular systolic function is slightly less vigorous.
Brief Hospital Course: 42 y/o male with MMP, ESRD on dialysis presents with hypertensive emergency and shortness of breath in the setting of likely cocaine use.
#) Hypertensive emergency: The patient's baseline hypertension is very difficult to control--per our records he is on isosorbide, hydralazine, carvedilol, and clonidine at baseline.
After dialysis his hypertension resolved.
There was some concern that his hypertensive episode was related to cocaine use (though pt adamently denied).
He has had previous admissions for similar symptoms and each time he has tested positive for cocaine.
#) Inferior lead ST depressions: Likely demand ischemia, but given initially flat troponins there was unclear [**Name2 (NI) 68402**].
He received an ECHO, which was unrevealing and had no wall motion abnormalities.
There was evidence of known non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Repeat EKG had persistent depressions and unclear as to the underlying cause, but ECHO was negative.
No clear evidence of infection.
He remained afebrile and no further workup was done.
Abd Pain:  pt having persistent chronic abdominal pain.
There was initial concern that this pain, was different and new, but after speaking with the patient, he said it was the same pain and did not want further imaging since all CT scanning has come back negative.
He is scheduled for repair of his ventral hernia in [**Month (only) 956**] and believes that this is the source of the pain.
He said if this surgery does not resolve his pain he will seek medical help for further evaluation.
#) Substance abuse: Unclear if patient is on methadone currently, and if so for pain or for chronic abuse.
He goes to the community clinic in [**Location (un) **] MA for his methadone.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Hypertensive Emergency .
Risk factors included unprotected heterosexual sex as well as intravenous drug use.
His nadir CD4 count is 91 and he has no known opportunistic infections.
Cryoglobulinemia 4.
Chronic renal insufficiency - MPGN by biopsy in [**2123**] and hypertensive nephrosclerosis 5.
A subacute infarct in the right caudate head seen on MRI in  [**1-29**] 13.
Depression 16.
You were intially admitted to the hospital for extremely elevated blood pressure and difficulty breathing.
You were admitted to the intensive care unit and you receive emergency hemodialysis to have the fluid removed from your body.
After that, your breathing greatly improved and you were ready to be transferred to the general medicine floor.
There were some concerning lab values that were likely all secondary to the stress your body went through during the elevated blood pressure and fluid overload.
You also had some abdominal pain, but this pain was the same as chronic pain you have had in the past.
We wanted to do a further work up of this pain and do some abdominal immaging, but you denied this as you have said this was done multiple times in the past and always negative.
You said you have a hernia that is being repaired in [**Month (only) 956**].
