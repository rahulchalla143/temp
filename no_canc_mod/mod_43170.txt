Pt is currently residing at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], where he had complaints of abdominal pain.
Pt says that a day and a half ago he had some right sided sharp, fleeting pain [**9-15**], non-radiating, lasting for a few seconds.
He says he has never had this pain before and denies any nausea and vomiting.
He noticed that his urination has decreased over the last day.
He feels cold, but denies fever or chills.
In the ED, initial vital signs were trigger for hypotension 84/61 - per EMS, BPs labile on route.
Exam was notable for pt was able to answer questions, no somnolent, did not assess for asterixis, irregular heart rate, significant bruising and petechiae across the chest wall, no chest tenderess; no back/flank bruising; guiaic positive, light brown stool.
Cards was consulted for elevated trop, but not concerned in setting of elevated Cr, and pt with no chest pain.
CXR showed a decrease in pulmonary vascular engorgement, otherwise stable from prior.
CT torso prelim read showed no acute abnormalities to explain pain, and only small ascites.
Bedside u/s showed no pericardial effusion, and only minimal ascites.
Labs were notable for hyponatremia (125 from 135 most recently), mildly decreased Hct from baseline 31-32 to 29.
Cr was notable for elevation of 2.0 from 1.4, AST, AP and lipase all mildly elevated.
On the floors, he currently feels weak, and hungry, but does not have any abdominal pain right now except for when he presses on his right side.
He had acute on chronic systolic heart failure, at which point his diuresis was uptitrated.
He was given a 3 day course of acetazolamide for contraction alkalosis.
He also had hyponatremia and [**Last Name (un) **] attributed to heart failure and poor forward flow that improved with diuresis.
His abdominal pain then was attributed to ascites.
He had a diagnostic para that was negative for SBP.
Also endorses knee pain from chronic arthritis.
He currently denies any fevers, night sweats, chest pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, constipation, bloody or black stools, hematuria, pain with urination though occasional "burning" at the end of his penis.

Sub-4mm pleural-based nodules are again visualized within the right upper lobe and lingula, stable in comparison to prior studies (2:18 and 36).
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT ORAL OR IV CONTRAST: Evaluation of the abdominal structures is again limited by the lack of intravenous contrast.
The liver appears to be shrunken with a nodular contour.
There is a small amount of abdominal ascites, decreased in comparison to prior study from [**2188-5-16**].
The kidneys are also atrophic bilaterally, but stable with no evidence of hydronephrosis or stones.
The patient remains status post splenectomy with a small amount of splenosis in the left upper quadrant, which remains unchanged.
The stomach, visualized loops of small and large bowel, and bilateral adrenal glands are within normal limits.

[**2188-6-13**] EGD Birth Date: [**2103-9-22**] (84 years) Instrument: GIF-H180 ([**Numeric Identifier 101235**])  ID#: 054 20 81 Medications: MAC Anesthesia  Indications: cirrhosis rule out varices Dysphagia  Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms.
The patient was administered moderate sedation.
The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and an endoscope was introduced through the mouth and advanced under direct visualization until the third part of the duodenum was reached.
There were no complications.
Patchy erythema of the mucosa was noted in the antrum.
Duodenum:  Flat Lesions A single medium angioectasia was seen in the distal bulb.
Impression: No varices Erosion in the [**Last Name (un) 67230**] greater curve Erythema in the antrum compatible with gastritis Angioectasia in the distal bulb Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum Recommendations: If any questions or you need to schedule an [**Telephone/Fax (1) 682**] or email at [**University/College 21854**] Additional notes: FINAL DIAGNOSES are listed in the impression section above.
Estimated blood loss = zero.
No specimens were taken for pathology   Brief Hospital Course: Pt is an 84 yo man with history of chronic systolic CHF (last EF 40%), pulmonary HTN, severe TR, diabetes type 2 now controlled off meds, afib on warfarin and congestive cirrhosis, who presents with abdominal pain and hypotension, and found to have acute on chronic renal insufficiency, hyponatremia and alkalosis.
Hypotension: Likely [**1-9**] hypovolemic etiology given clinically dry, elevated BUN/Cr, recent increased diuresis and poor po intake.
Pt had no s/s infection and no leukocytosis to suggest infectious etiology or sepsis.
UA was unremarkable, and CXR without infiltrate.
Acute on Chronic systolic CHF: With volume status restored, patient had slight volume overload and diuretics were slowly re-introduced.
This was evidenced by right pleural effusion and increased requirement for oxygen at rest.
Physical exam of right lung base and symptoms of dyspnea improved over a few days when diuretics were re-introduced at lower dose.
DDx includes constipation vs. SBP vs. cholelithiasis vs. pancreatitis vs. ileus vs. gastritis.
Lipase is elevated, though clinically pt has no epigastric pain, and clinical story of location of pain and duration is not c/w pancreatitis.
Pt is passing gas and had BM so ileus less likely, in addition to no obstruction seen on CT. Cholelithiasis certainly possible given brief intermittent pain, that has now since resolved.
Elevated alk phos and AST could be explained by intermittent cholelithiasis.
Given guaiac positive stools, gastritis also possible, though intermittent nature makes this less likely.
LFTs were within normal limits, and RUQ u/s showed no evidence of infection, although it did show coarse echotexture of the liver, with lobulated contour compatible with cirrhosis, a small amount of ascites, a small right pleural effusion, and cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
Upper endoscopy showed no varices, but erosions in the stomach and vascular ectasia of the duodenum.
On discharge, his Hct was trending upwards to 28.4 from 25 two days prior, and there was no frank blood or melena ever observed in his stool.
This is likely a slow, chronic GI bleed and felt to be stable.
# Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Likely pre-renal in setting of poor po intake, and diuresis as discussed above.
ATN also possible given BP slightly lower than baseline.
FeUrea 31%, suggestive of pre-renal etiology.
# Metabolic Alkalosis with resp compensation: Pt has significant alkalosis with HCO3 of 36 on admission, has been higher up to 39.
Suspect that this is contraction alkalosis [**1-9**] overdiuresis.
ABG obtained showed 7.44/55/79/39, suggestive of respiratory compensation.
# Elevated troponin: Trop was elevated to 0.25 from prior 0.11.
However, in the setting of elevated Cr, this is the most likely etiology.
Reassuring that EKG unchanged, and pt has no chest pain.
Hyponatremia: Hypovolemic hyponatremia as evidenced by picture of dehydration as discussed above.
Possible etiologies include upper slow bleed given brown stools, such erosions and duodenal ectasia.
No reported bloody or black stools, which is reassuring.
However, suspect that this is hemoconcentrated given picture of dehydration as discussed above.
Fe studies and retic count were sent, which showed no evidence of hemolysis, and without reticulocytosis to suggest bleeding.
# Atrial fibrillation: Chronically on Warfarin, for CHADS 4 (CHF, HTN, Age and Diabetes).
# Lower extremity wounds: Exam c/w venous stasis ulcers with no evidence of superinfection.
Besides weight loss, likely [**1-9**] issues of poor po intake & diuresis, no other s/s hyperthyroidism.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Last Name (Titles) 101236**],  You were admitted to the hospital because you had an episode of abdominal pain and your blood pressure was very low.
Your level of red blood cells dropped for a few days and we were worried about you losing blood into your GI tract because we found evidence of a slow blood loss in your stool.
An upper endoscopy showed an abnormal blood vessel in the stomach that may be leading to slow blood loss.
There were no rapidly bleeding vessels seen in this study.
You were discharged from the hospital with a plan to decrease some of your diuretics and follow up with your doctor about the slow bleeding in your stomach.
Please make the following changes in your medications: - STOP taking Metolazone - STOP taking Potassium Chloride 10meq daily - CHANGE your dose of Torsemide to two 20mg tabs twice daily (previously you had been taking 60 mg twice a day) - CHANGE aldactone to 25mg twice daily (previously you were taking 50mg in the night and 25mg in the morning) - DECREASE your dose of Toprol XL to 25 mg Daily (previously you had been taking 50 mg Daily) - START senna  8.6 mg Tablet: Take 2 tablets at night as needed for constipation - START acetaminophen  325 mg Tablet: Take 1-2 Tablets PO every six (6) hours as needed for fever or pain.
- START Miralax  17 gram Powder in Packet: Take One (1) packet PO once a day as needed for constipation  Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.
