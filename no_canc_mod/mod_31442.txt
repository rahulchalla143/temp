HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was a 76-year-old female with a history of aortic valve replacement and mitral valve replacement, on chronic Coumadin therapy, who presented to [**Hospital1 69**] after a fall which led to a subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe and small subdural hematoma.
The patient was brought into the hospital after an unwitnessed fall with a question of head trauma and a question of loss of consciousness.
She did not complain of any chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting either prior to the fall or subsequent to the fall.
She did complain of left thumb pain on admission.
The patient was also diagnosed with multi-infarct dementia possibly secondary to her valve replacements.
Her general appearance revealed she was a confused-appearing and well-nourished female in no apparent distress.
She had dry mucous membranes.
Her neck examination showed no masses, no jugular venous distention, no carotid bruits.
Cardiovascular examination was irregularly irregular with a prominent first heart sound and second heart sound secondary to her valve replacements.
There were no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Her extremities showed no edema, clubbing or cyanosis, and there was a splint on her left thumb.
She ruled out for a myocardial infarction with three sets of cardiac enzymes, and her digoxin level was found to be 0.6.
Her creatine kinase was found to be 796; consistent with her trauma.
RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Otherwise, a CT of the head showed a question of a subdural hematoma at the right sylvian fissure versus a brain contusion.
There was found to be a focus of high density in the right frontal lobe.
Also, a small subdural collection adjacent to the right [**Last Name (un) 44708**].
There was moderate brain atrophy, and a remote lacunar infarct in the left caudate and anterior limb of the internal capsule.
A CT of the cervical spine showed no fractures.
An x-ray of the lumbar spine showed no fractures.
An x-ray of the thoracic spine showed no fractures.
An x-ray of the hand showed a transverse fracture of the left distal first phalanx.
HOSPITAL COURSE:   The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was significant for an admission to Neurosurgery where she remained for one day and had her anticoagulation reversed with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K.  She was subsequently transferred to the Medicine Service after serial CT examinations of the head which were negative for an increase in the size of the bleed.
Upon transfer to Medicine, her anticoagulation was restarted due to concerns over the formation of clots along her mitral or aortic valve replacements.
The Neurology Stroke Service agreed with this assessment and decided the patient should be anticoagulated for at one week with serial CT examinations to look for increasing size of the subarachnoid hemorrhage with a central hematoma and could subsequently be switched to Coumadin after one week with a stable CT scan of the head.
