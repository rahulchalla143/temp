Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Bronchoscopy x3 ([**8-2**], [**8-3**], [**8-7**])  History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 1924**] is a 65 y/o man with history of AAA repair ([**1-/2163**]) c/b T8 paraplegia, bowel perforation leading to graft infection with bacteriodes, strep pneumo and [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 23729**]/fungemia on chronic suppressive medications (antibiotics and antifungals - fluconazole, cipro, flagyl), recently admitted and discharged on [**7-9**] for PNA, who represented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**8-1**] from [**Hospital 38**] rehab w/ increasing white count to 39, increased shortness of breath, increased cough and inability to clear his airway secretions.
During his previous admission he had CT imaging demonstrating collapsed lower lobe with concern for chronic infectious process vs mucus plugging.
Given acute deterioration in respiratory function he underwent bronchoscopy that demonstrated purulent secretions in the LLL c/w infection.
However, after discharge, pt grew resistant Pseudomonas in his BAL fluid culture.
Readmitted on [**8-1**] directly to the MICU for worsening SOB with sats in the high 70s.
Currently, he feels better from a respiratory standpoint.
ROS: Otherwise positive for occasional pleuritic CP, chest heaviness, occasional pain from his abdominal surgical area with tenderness though unchanged.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, change in stool from ostomy, no melena or BRB from ostomy.
He has no feeling from his penis so would not know if he had burning, and chronically has a foley.
Past Medical History: - AAA repair ([**1-/2163**]) c/b T8 paraplegia, bowel perforation with graft infection and bacteremia/fungemia (bacteriodes, strep pneumo and [**Female First Name (un) **]).
- complete heart block, now status post pacemaker placement - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - COPD - Osteoarthritis - Increased PSA for which the patient underwent a biopsy prior to [**2163-1-29**], which was complicated by an E. coli bacteremia - s/p Trach for inability to clear secretions  Social History: Has 50 pack-year smoking history who stopped smoking prior to his admission in [**Month (only) 404**].

On Discharge: GEN: pleasant, chronically ill appearing male, NAD HEENT: MMM, op without lesions, no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, trach collar in place, CV: RRR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g RESP: Decreased breath sounds in the lung bases with crackles in the right lung bases as well.
No wheezes ABD: large graft, healing skin, right-sided ostomy with brown stool, soft, non-tender EXT: Warm and well perfused, no edema GU: foley in place, light yellow urine SKIN: no jaundice, no splinters, no rashes NEURO: AAOx3.
Urine Culture [**2163-8-2**] No Growth .
Blood Cultures 7/4 and [**8-7**]: No growth .
RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2163-8-6**]):       Commensal Respiratory Flora Absent.
if pulmonary Histoplasmosis, Coccidioidomycosis, Blastomycosis,       Aspergillosis or Mucormycosis is strongly suspected, contact the       Microbiology Laboratory (7-2306).
STUDIES: CXR [**2163-8-1**]: IMPRESSION: Persistent moderate bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis.
Retrocardiac atelectasis versus less likely infection.
CXR [**2163-8-2**]: Left lower lobe atelectasis is chronic.
Moderate right lower lobe atelectasis developed after [**7-26**], unchanged.
Small bilateral pleural effusions also unchanged.
Transvenous right ventricular pacer in standard placement.
No pneumothorax.
CXR [**2163-8-4**]: IMPRESSION: Persisting and unchanged bilateral basal atelectatic changes and bilateral pleural effusions.
Left PICC line is present, tip at confluence of brachiocephalic and proximal SVC.
Hazy density at both lung bases likely reflects presence of bilateral effusions.
Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, probably slightly worse compared with one day earlier.
Probable atelectasis right base medially.
Brief Hospital Course: 65 y/o man with a history of AAA repair ([**1-/2163**]) c/b T8 paraplegia, bowel perforation leading to graft infection with bacteriodes, strep pneumo and [**Female First Name (un) **] bacteremia/fungemia on chronic suppressive medications, recently admitted and discharged on [**7-9**] for SOB, and treated for a PNA, who represents to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital 38**] rehab w/ increasing white count, increased shortness of breath, hypoxia, and leukocytosis.
He was found to have quinolone resistant pneumonia, and treated with Meropenem.
# Pseudomonas Pneumonia: Patient presented with worsening dyspnea, fever, leukocytosis (28), increased sputum production, and infiltrate seen on CXR suggestive of pneumonia.
In the MICU, patient underwent multiple bronchoscopy due to concern for mucous plugging with return of thick secretions.
ID was consulted and patient was initiated on meropenem based on prior sensitivities for pseudomonas from BAL cultures as well as to cover for bacteriodes.
# Hypoxemnia: Likely secondary to mucus plugging and HCAP.
Repeat urine culture when foley was changed ([**8-4**]) showed no growth.
# Pre-Existing Sacral Decubitus ulcer stage 4: Patient has chronic sacral stage IV pressure ulcer.
Patient did not have any rashes and did not complain of SOB or throat closing and symptoms relieved with benadryl.
No change in stool color in the colostomy.
# HTN: on lisinopril as home med.
This was held in the ICU given infection and concern for developing hypotension.
# Depression/Anxiety: Continued paroxetine, trazodone, ativan prn.
# Chronic Immobilization secondary to Paraplegia: Continued fondaparinux.
Patient will also follow up with PCP for anemia and resolution of pneumonia.
