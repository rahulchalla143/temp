There is marked cardiomegaly.
The diaphragms are not optimally seen, presumably related to confluence of overlying soft tissue, patient motion, and possible pulmonary opacities which are not excluded on this study and must be placed in clinical context.
Possible right lower lobe consolidation.
LENIs IMPRESSION: Limited study with incomplete evaluation of the proximal left superficial femoral vein, otherwise, no evidence of DVT.
Echo The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
Significant aortic stenosis cannot be fully excluded.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2113-8-9**], symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy is more prominent and right ventricular enlargement with free wall hypokinesis is now apparent.
The aortic root is also now dilated and moderate tricuspid regurgitation and mild pulmonary artery systolic pressure are now present.
Shortness of breath:  Worsening over past several weeks.
Possible infiltrate on CXR so the patient completed levofloxacin x 5 days.
D-dimer was borderline elevated and had sinus tachycardia on admission.
Primarily, it was felt that her shortness of breath is likely due to her morbid obesity, causing obesity-hypoventilation syndrome.
There was one incidence of hypercarbic respiratory failure that was due to malfunction of her machine.
Pulmonary Hypertension: Likely secondary to obesity hypoventilation syndrome, OSA.
Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain: hold for rr<12 or oversedation.
Heparin (Porcine) in NS  Intravenous   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome Obstructive sleep apnea Pulmonary embolism Morbid obesity   Discharge Condition: stable, on 6 liters NC oxygen   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital due to difficulty breathing.
You were found to have sleep apnea and low oxygen levels during the day.
You were also started on medication to thin your blood in case you have a blood clot in your lungs.
You are on heparin IV for possible PE and will remain on this until your INR is therapeutic.
If you have worsening of your breathing, fevere, chills, chest pain or other concerning symptoms please seek medical attention.
