Starting about four days ago, the patient began having loose stools (soft, not liquid) about 2-3 times per day.

She denies abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
She denies any respiratory difficulty, cough, chest pain, blood in her stools, dysuria, or lower extremity edema.
She endorses a decreased appetite for several weeks and decreased PO intake.
Within the last few days, the patient noticed that her lips were quite swollen; she saw her PCP who treated her with hydroxyzine for presumed allergic reaction.

Family History: Family History: mother with lumpectomy   Physical Exam: PE: T 98.9 HR 65 BP 112/45 RR 14 O2 sat 100% on 3LNC Gen: Alert, pleasant elderly female in NAD, speaking in full sentences HEENT: Lips dry with evidence of crusting, no sign of superinfection.

No crackles or wheezing.
Loud, harsh 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the LLSB but radiating throughout the precordium.
Skin: Other than crusting at lips, no visible rashes.
CXR: (prelim) hazy opacity at right lung base concerning for atelectasis versus pneumonia   Brief Hospital Course: A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female who presents with hypotension of unclear etiology, likely septic shock.
This was thought to be most likely secondary to septic shock vs. hypovolemia.
Her EKG was unchanaged and she did not complain of chest pain making cardiogenic shock unlikely.
On presentation the patient had a WBC count of 10.3 with 28% bands and a fever to 101.3 suggesting septic shock as the etiology for her hyptension.
She completed a course of antibiotics for c. diff colitis approximately ten days prior to presentation.
On exam she had no abdominal pain and actually did not have any diarrhea for hospital days one and two.
Her CXR showed a possible pneumonia vs. atelectasis but on presentation she complained of no respiratory symptoms.
Blood and urine cultures were negative but stool was positive for c. diff.
# Congestive Heart Failure:  Patient noted to be increasingly short of breath on hospital day 2 with increased pulmonary edema on CXR.
Upon discharge, she was off diuretics and without dyspnea.
# Mouth sores: On presentation she was noted to have numerous small sores on her upper and lower lips thought to be herpes labialis.
She was given topical acyclovir and symptomatic therapy.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Patient noted to have intermittent atrial fibrillation throughout her stay.
At home the patient takes norvasc 2.5 mg and avapro 150 mg for HTN at home.
She was started on norvasc and valsartan 80 mg.  On this regimen she was persistently hypertensive and her atrial fibrillation was poorly rate controlled.
She subsequently developed orthostatic hypotension and she was switched to extended release diltiazem 180mg daily on discharge.
