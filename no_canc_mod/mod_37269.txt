Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Normal left ventricular cavity sizes with preserved global systolic function.
Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2146-11-8**], a small-moderate circumferential pericardial effusion is now present.
The severity of tricuspid regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure are now reduced.
His echo revealed a small, 1.2 cm circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade.
Sternal erythema was noted and IV vancomycin and oral cipro were started.
Additionally, he developed small, fluctuant collections of the sternal incision.
These were incised and drained to reveal blood and serous fluid.
There was no pus or evidence of infection.
The erythema continued to progress on antibiotics and the sternum became unstable.
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2146-12-20**] for sternal exploration and debridement with a vacuum dressing placement.
On [**12-29**] he had a third debridement with a vacuum dressing placement.
He was seen in consultation by the ID service for an OR culture that grew pseudomonas and for c.diff (PCR positive) diarrhea.
He was started on TPN due to poor oral intake.
He was started on wellbutrin to help with smoking cessation and any depression that may be inhibiting his poor oral intake.
Coumadin was started for atrial fibrillation and history of pulmonary embolism, but due to his extreme sensitivity toward coumadin, only low doses were used and INR was checked daily.
He complained of a painful abdomen but was given maalox with resolution of his symptoms.
