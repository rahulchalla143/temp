She had an MRI done 2 years ago for monitoring to follow what appeared to be both a mitral valve murmur and an aortic valve murmur.
Mitral valve prolapse, mitral regurgitation and aortic    insufficiency.
Bronchitis in [**2136**].
Pneumonia in [**2133**].
Preop chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly without any evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
Preop EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 58 with an otherwise unremarkable EKG.
Cardiac catheterization performed in [**2139-3-6**] showed normal coronaries, 4+ MR, moderate AI 3+, no aortic stenosis, ejection fraction 60% and an LVEDP of 12.
Echocardiogram performed on [**2139-2-3**] showed moderately dilated left atrium with an ejection fraction of 58%, eccentric MR 2+, AI moderate to severe, [**Hospital1 **]-leaflet prolapse of her mitral valve with 4+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] PA systolic pressures.
Cardiac MRI performed in [**2139-2-3**] showed increased LV size, LV ejection fraction of 62% with a forward EF of 33%, mild aortic insufficiency, tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonic regurgitation.
as needed at sleep and oral antibiotics for dental work.
ALLERGIES:  She had multiple allergies as follows: Codeine, penicillin, Gentamycin, sulfa, Vancomycin and morphine which gave her chest tightness.
She had no obvious skin lesions.
Her neck was supple without any lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
Her lungs were clear bilaterally without any rales or rhonchi.
Her heart was regular rate and rhythm with a grade 2/6 systolic and also an early diastolic murmur with radiation.
Her abdomen was soft and nontender and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Her extremities had no cyanosis, clubbing or edema or any varicosities that were noted.
HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  She came in as same day admission on [**5-8**] and underwent aortic valve replacement by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] with a 25 mm [**Last Name (un) 106009**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] magna pericardial tissue valve and a mitral valve replacement with a 31 mm [**Last Name (un) 106009**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] paramount pericardial tissue valve.
Her abdomen was soft and nontender and nondistended.
On the 6th it was noted that the patient felt a right parasternal click when she was turning her head.
Her pain was adequately controlled.
She was a little bit weepy and depressed on postoperative day 3, when she was transferred out to the floor.
She was also given some Milk of Magnesia and Dulcolax to help her with an initial bowel movement.
She remained in sinus rhythm with an occasional PVC.
Status post aortic valve replacement and mitral valve    replacement with pericardial tissue valves.
Status post pneumonia [**2138**].
