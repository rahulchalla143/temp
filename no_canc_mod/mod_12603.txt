Admission Date:  [**2180-9-2**]              Discharge Date:   [**2180-9-5**]   Service: NEUROLOGY  Allergies: Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Cipro / Levaquin  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**] Chief Complaint: Fall, syncope  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None  History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname **] is an 88 yo LH woman with a PMH remarkable for HTN, CAD s/p stent in [**2172**] and a diagnosis of SLE 18 years ago (based on dermatological and serological criteria) p/w CNS bleed s/p fall.
She did not feel unsteady and did not have any CP or SOB.
She had no prior headache.
There was no loss of sphincter control.
There was no tongue biting.
As per my read, it showed a minor LEFT frontal bleed by her skull.
No edema or mass effect.
NO features suspicious of an underlying mass.
There was no fracture.
Importantly, there were no recent changes in her meds.
There is no hematological, cardiac or pulmonary affection that I am aware of.
Family History: Father with murmur  Physical Exam: O: T:98.1  BP: 191/77  HR:61   R 16  O2Sats 99 RA Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Left bundle-branch block.
Cannot exclude old inferior wall myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2173-1-14**] Q-T interval prolongation and marked anterolateral T wave inversion with inferior compponent has resolved.
Left bundle-branch block is new.
Left superior gyrus focus of hemorrhage with surrounding edema likely representing hemorrhagic contusion; however, given the peripheral enhancement hemorrhagic neoplasm cannot be excluded.
Left posterior centrum semiovale lacunar infarct, chronic.
Moderate chronic microangiopathic small vessel ischemic changes.
Mild diffuse parenchymal volume loss.
Pansinus opacification as detailed above, reflecting either inspissated secretions or fungal sinusitis.
Bilateral uncinectomies.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2180-9-4**] at 2:01:58 PM Conclusions The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
No aortic stenosis is seen.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION:Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
No focal or epileptiform features were noted.
She was clinically asymptomatic and had no events on tele.
She was evaluated for causes of underlying cerebral bleeding as well as both cardiac and seizure etiologies of LOC.
Her hospital course by problem is as follows: 1) NEUROLOGICALLY: An MRI was therefore obtained to evaluate for possible underlying amyloid angiopathy.
Her MRI did not however reveal this or an underlying mass, stroke or vessel abnormality.
Therefore her bleeding was felt to be due to trauma.
She did however have evidence of vessel abnormalities in that her R vertebral artery was both hypoplastic and focally stenosed.
She was therefore started on simvastatin and aspirin 81mg for secondary stroke prevention.
Overall, it was felt the patient's bleed was secondary to her fall.
2) CARDIAC: Ms. [**Known lastname 36900**] BP remained elevated and her initial BP was 207/73.
Given the wide pulse pressure, there was concern for possible AS, although she did not have a murmur on exam.
A TTE was therefore obtained which showed no evidence of aortic stenosis.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] was also monitored on telemetry and did not have evidence of dysthymias.
Cardiac enzymes were checked on admission for possible ischemia causing syncope.
Her initial troponin was 0.02 but repeats showed a gradual increase to 0.03 and then 0.04.
Cardiology was therefore involved for further assessment of these changes.
It was felt that the patient's slow troponin rise was related to her hypertension and that subendocardial ischemia was the cause.
She should continue to be followed by her PCP and cardiologist to ensure tight blood pressure control.
Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Intracerebral bleed Hypertension Anemia   Discharge Condition: Stable, no focal neurological deficits   Discharge Instructions: You were admitted for evaluation after being found unresponsive at home.
During this hospitalization, you were found to have a small bleed in your head which was most likely from your fall.
Because of your fainting episode, for the safety of all it is required by law that you do not drive for at least 6 months.
Please call you doctor or come to the ED if you develop new or worsening symptoms  Followup Instructions: DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 27599**] Please call to schedule an appointment at your earliest convenience.
