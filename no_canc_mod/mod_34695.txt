Admission Date:  [**2129-8-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2129-9-19**]  Date of Birth:  [**2061-8-7**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**] Chief Complaint: OSH transfer for CABG  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: -Placement of PICC line -Cardiac Catheterization with placement of BMS to LCx and placement of intra-aortic balloon pump  History of Present Illness: 68 F with morbid obesity, HTN, NIDDM, and hypercholersterolemia, transfer from OSH with RP bleed s/p cath and for possible CABG, now transferred to CCU service after surgery delayed due to infectious issues.
Admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**2129-8-25**] with intermittent CP, SOB and fatigue for 3 weeks; had significant anteriolateral ST segment depressions and was treated with heparin, integralin, aspirin, and sublingual nitro.
This caused a retroperitoneal bleed with hypotension treated with fluids and transfusion of PRBCs and neo.
Cath revealed 3 VD - 100% occlusion of proximal RCA, long 70% stenosis of mid LAD, and long 80% stenosis of mid-LCx.
On day of transfer ([**8-27**]) she became hypotensive, dropped her HCT, and was intubated (reportedly due to pulmonary edema).
CT scan as below (6x6 cm hematoma with no evidence of active extravasation).
Following transfer she developed fevers to 102 with continued hypotension requiring pressor therapy.
Now transfer to CCU service for further managment of her cardiac and medical issues while surgery on hold due to infection.
Review of symptoms deferred [**1-22**] patient intubation/sedation; refer to prior admit note for further details.
Past Medical History: - Obesity - HTN - Diabetes type II x 15 years (patient has refused multiple treatments for this in the past) - Peripheral neuropathy - PVD (details unknown) - Hyperlipidemia   Social History: Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco use.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death  Physical Exam: On Transfer to CCU: VS: Tc 100.1, Tm 101.1, BP 127/60 (85-132), HR 78, RR 13, O2 97% on AC 0.5 FiO2, 700 x12 PEEP 8 Gen: obese female NAD, intubated and sedated HEENT: NCAT.
Sclera anicteric.
No hematoma present.
Withdraws to pain bilat LE and grimaces bilat UE.
Pertinent Results: [**2129-9-5**] echo There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no pericardial effusion.
7 x 7 cm right pelvic hematoma extending into the inguinal region with mild perihematoma stranding.
No focal abscesses or fluid collections to explain patient's symptoms.
Distended sludge and stone-filled gallbladder, unchanged since the appearance on ultrasound yesterday.
Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
Multiple hypoattenuating renal lesions the largest in the interpolar left kidney may represent a simple cyst, others are too [**Known lastname **] to characterize.
Residual contrast in the kidneys from a recent cardiac catheterization suggesting acute renal failure.
Elevated filling pressures of both ventricles, elevated pulmonary pressures consistent with LV failure.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal left circumflex with a bare metal stent.
Successful placement of a 30cc IABP via the right femoral artery.
Brief Hospital Course: 68 F with morbid obesity, DM II, HTN; transfer from OSH with 3VD on cath and RP bleed due to femoral artery laceration.
# CAD/Ischemia: Ruled in for MI at OSH.
Recieved coronary catheterization which showed 3vd and no intervenable culprit lesion.
She developed a retroperitoneal bleed secondary to femoral artery laceration and was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible CABG.
While preparing for transfer she became hypotensive and went into respiratory failure thought secondary to pulmonary edema.
While being treated for her VAP she became hypotensive and an EKG showed new ST elevations, she was taken to the cath lab and recieved a BMS to the LCx and transfered back to CCU w/ balloon pump/pressors.
She was quickly weaned off of the balloon pump but remained on pressors for several days for suspected concomitant septic shock.
# Hypotension/shock.
Mixed picture due to impaired cardiac function (inferior HK) and sepsis/shock; also hypovolemic at times with rapid bleeding.
Appeared to be combination of septic/cardiogenic shock as she had warm extremities and the shock resolved gradually over several days w/ treatment of her CAD and appropriate Abx.
After extubation she actually became hypertensive and required antihypertensive medication.
# Pump: EF 40%, mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls.
She appeared to be severely volume overloaded w/ edema and wet lung exam and needed to be diuresed several liters before she could be extubated.
After extubation she had several episodes of flash pulmonary edema precipitated by either positional changes or systemic hypertension.
Her pulmonary edema responded reliably and quickly to IV nitro drip and she continued to require diuresis for several days after extubation but her functional status improved daily w/ diuresis.
# Rhythm: NSR, had several episodes of hypotensive VT which required shocks, all of these occured during one night several days after she was percutaneously revascularized.
Although we believe that her risk of ventricular tachycardia is minimal now that the ischemic insult has been removed, she should continue to have close monitoring of her heart rhythm.
# VAP: CXR/chest CT was not impressive for PNA, but when Abx were stopped her WBC increased dramatically and she spiked fevers.
Her sputum eventually grew out multi resistant Acinetobacter baumanii sensitive to high dose unasyn.
High dose unasyn was started and her fevers stopped, her hypotension began to resolve and her WBC's gradually decreased to normal.
Her septic shock initially prompted concern for abdominal source as she grimaced when pressure was applied to her RUQ and her labs were concerning for cholestasis.
RUQ u/s was negative and her labs were attributed to intrahepatic cholestasis secondary to systemic sepsis.
Also consider atheroembolic, AIN from unknown new med, prerenal or ATN from sepsis or hypovolemia.
# Hypertension: After extubation her blood pressure was elevated, even after uptitration of her BB and ACEI.
# Diabetes: She currently has adequate glycemic control on regular insulin sliding scale and 22U glargine qhs.
