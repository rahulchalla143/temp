Active Issues:  # Actue on chronic Systolic CHF exacerbation: Patient presented with respiratory distress, noted to be tachypneic with O2 saturation of 82% on room air initially, which improved back to baseline with diuresis (lasix gtt).
He had a history of crack pneumonitis and systolic congestive heart failure, as well as a diagnosis of COPD.
Possible etiologies of the patient's exacerbation included pneumonitis from continued crack use, heart failure exacerbation or COPD exacerbation.
Given his orthopnea, PND, and possible underdosing of his furosemide, pt was diuresed with a lasix gtt with a large symptomatic improvement.
# Type I Diabetes:  Pt's BG's were in the 400's initially in the ICU, likely [**1-21**] to the high dose steroids he received in the ED.
He will follow up with his PCP for further titration of his insulin.
He has never acted on these voices, and has no current suicidal or homicidal ideation.
