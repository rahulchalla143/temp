Severe scoliosis and resulting asymmetry of the rib cage is again noted, making evaluation quite suboptimal.
No evidence of a pleural effusion is seen.
There is no definite focal consolidation in the left lung, although it is difficult to exclude in the right lung.
There may be a right upper lobe consolidation as seen on prior radiographs and acuity is difficult to assess, although appears slightly increased compared to the prior study.
Opacity at the right lung base also raises concern for infection and/or aspiration, although difficult to assess.
[**2130-4-17**] Left Knee X-ray: There is no definite fracture or dislocation.
Severe joint space narrowing in the medial and lateral compartments is noted.
No joint effusion.
The bones appear grascile with diffuse demineralization.
Brief Hospital Course: 27 yo male with Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] syndrome, chronic restrictive/obstructive lung disease, recurrent hospitalizations for pneumonia (including admission in [**11/2129**] for pseudomonal PNA resistant to meropenem and cefepime) who presented with chest tightness, dyspnea, and increased ventilation requirements in the setting of probable recurrent PNA.
# HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient's dyspnea and increasing ventilator requirements at home, in addition to CXR findings suggestive of possible right-sided opacities on admission, concerning for recurrent pneumonia.
Patient afebrile and without leukocytosis, but symptoms similar to those he has had with previous pneumonias.
He has been on oral bactrim for prophylaxis, and was most recently treated [**11/2129**]/[**2129**] with ceftazidime and tobramycin due to resistance pattern of pseudomonas.
He will have twice-weekly CBC, BUN/Cr, and LFTs and once-weekly tobramycin troughs with results faxed to the [**Hospital **] clinic.
# RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE/OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE: Patient has restrictive lung disease secondary to his bony deformities.
# CHEST PAIN: Pain seemed pleuritic in nature, and was likely secondary to recurrent pneumonia.
No known history of cardiac disease.
Given substernal nature of chest tightness and associated dyspnea, evaluated for possible ACS.
Chest pain resolved with treatment of pneumonia.
# HAJDU-[**Location (un) **] SYNDROME: He is currently being treated with methadone 50mg and morphine for diffuse painful bony deformities.
Chronic back pain and left knee pain likely secondary to underlying disease, and no evidence on exam to suggest septic arthritis of left knee.
X-ray of left knee showed severe joint space narrowing but no evidence of fracture.
Standing acetaminophen added for additional pain control.
# ANEMIA: HCT at patient's approximate baseline.
Based on previous work-up, likely secondary to anemia of chronic inflammation.
# CONSTIPATION: Continued miralax.
# DEPRESSION: Continued bupropion and lorazepam per home regimen.
13. lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO HS (at bedtime) as needed for insomnia or anxiety.
