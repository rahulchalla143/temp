Bilateral patchy opacities with some nodular features are more pronounced in the lower lobes.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is detected.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral pulmonary opacities suggesting pneumonia.
Superimposed pulmonary nodules cannot be excluded.
[**2158-1-29**] head CT: FINDINGS: There is concordant prominence of the ventricles and sulci, consistent with generalized volume loss.
Hypoattenuation in the periventricular white matter most likely represents chronic microvascular infarction.
No intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal extraaxial fluid collection, mass effect or midline shift is detected.
Dense atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the internal carotid arteries.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Brief Hospital Course: 73 year-old man with bladder cancer, stomach cancer admitted now with nonketotic hyperosmolar state (ketones in UA felt likely secondary to starvation/ketosis-no anion gap on Chem 7 and no acidosis on ABG), pneumonia, UTI.
Patient was not acidotic, did not have gap, but ketones on UA, felt secondary to starvation ketosis.
Patient never developed gap or acidosis.
Concerning his pneumonia/UTI: Patient febrile with elevated white count, infiltrates on chest x-ray and urine with pansensitive Klebsiella.
[**1-31**] Blood cultures from [**2158-1-29**] with pansensitive Klebsiella.

No evidence of acute bleeding.
Likely component of CRI secondary to hypertension/DM.
