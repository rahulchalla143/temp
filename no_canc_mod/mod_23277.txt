History of Present Illness: This 56 year old woman with a known bicuspid aortic valve and aortic insufficiency is followed by echocardiograms.
She developed atrial fibrillation in the fall of [**2179**] and started on Coumadin.
A follow-up echocardiogram in [**2182-2-18**] revealed a significant drop in her ejection fraction from 55% to 25% with at least moderate aortic insufficiency.
She is now admitted for cardiac catheterization to assess for coronary disease and Heparin in preparation for valve surgery.

No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30%).
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.5 cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
Right ventricular free wall systolic function is improved - now with mild to moderate global hypokinesis.
The left ventricle also displays improved global function - now also with mild to moderate global hypokinesis an an EF of about 40%.
There is a bioprosthesis in the aortic position.
There is trace valvular aortic regurgitation which is normal for this prosthesis.
There is trace mitral regurgitation.
The tricuspid regurgitation appears improved - now likeky mild to moderate.
No new areas of consolidation.
No evidence for progressive distension of the pulmonary vasculature.
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change versus prior.
The patient noted some vaginal bleeding following administration of Heparin.
Bleeding ceased, and after evaluation, no further intervention was indicated.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
She remained in atrial fibrillation, and an EP consult was obtained.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
Atrial fibrillation (ventricular rate in the 80s) persisted and the patient underwent a TEE in preparation for cardioversion.
There was a question of atrial thrombus and cardioversion was postponed.
By the time of discharge on POD 6 she was ambulating, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
