RADIOLOGY  Final Report CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT)  [**2118-5-18**] 12:06 PM CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT) Reason: ISCHEMIA BILATERAL LEGS [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 70 year old woman with PVD REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: preop RT leg bypass EXAMINATION: Peripheral vascular disease.
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2117-11-25**]: Lungs are mildly hyperinflated.
More pronounced oligemia in the right upper lobe could be due to emphysema.
Irregular opacities at the apices of both lungs, particularly the left, most likely scars, but a prior radiograph should be obtained to confirm that this is not a new finding and therefore requiring additional evaluation.
A very small pericardial effusion is probably present.
No pleural effusion.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2118-5-19**] 12:11 PM CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Reason: SOB [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 70 year old woman with REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: SOB INDICATION: Shortness of breath.
Diffuse reticular interstitial opacities are unchanged.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
No focal consolidations.
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
Diffuse reticular interstitial opacities suggest interstitial disease.
She underwent a diagnostic abdominal aortogram, pelvic arteriogram, bilateral lower extremity runoffs, brachial arterial puncture with third order catheterization on [**2118-5-17**].
Her foley catheter was removed without complications.
