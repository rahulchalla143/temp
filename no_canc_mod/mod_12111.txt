Per the patient's care assistant, he had some chest congestion yesterday, but was otherwise well.
Today, he had fatigue, malaise, fever, and progressive shortness of breath, leading him to present the ED.

He has had left lower extremity edema for the past 3 weeks.

Mr. [**Known lastname 9449**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with HTN, PVD s/p fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass, recurrent DVTs on indefinite Coumadin, Mobitz II s/p pacemaker.
He presented with acute respiratory failure, high fevers, and severe LLE cellulitis.
# Acute Respiratory Failure: His decompensation and recovery from a respiratory point of view were both remarkably rapid.
He has a history of recurrent aspiration and is on a modified diet, but we would have expected some evidence of plugging/collapse or pneumonitis if this picture was  the consequence of an aspiration event.
He was also empirically treated for PE on admission given his history of recurrent DVTs and recent pausing of coumadin for an elective procedure.
The speed of his recovery argues against pneumonia or PE.
It is conceivable that the increased metabolic demand (high fevers) associated with his severe cellulitis was the cause of his acute respiratory failure.
# LLL Cellulitis: Likely responsible for his acute decompensation as above.
LENIs were negative for persistent DVT.
Given that he presented in extremis because of cellulitis, an argument for a full course of vancomycin could be made, but the patient's family reported that he has a history of pulling out catheters and lines.
# h/o DVT: On coumadin chronically as an outpatient.
His family declined CTA as he has a history of agitation associated with CTs.
Because of his history of DVT recurrence and possiblity of PE, he was discharged on a lovenox bridge (1.5mg/kg daily) and 5mg coumadin daily.
# Anemia: He had a Hct drop after fluid resuscitation in the MICU.
# Nutrition: Coughing while trying to eat with nurse.
The patient declined a video swallow and his diet was down-graded to ground solids with thickened liquids.
# Hypertension: His lisinopril was held on admission because of hypotension and renal failure.
It was not re-started as he remained normotensive without it.
2. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for constipation.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Street Address(1) 19127**] at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3340**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19128**] - [**Location (un) 583**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Acute Respiratory Failure Cellulitis Chronic LE DVTs Hypertension BPH w/ urinary obstruction   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 9449**],  You were brought to the hospital with acute respiratory failure which required ICU-level support.
The cause of your initial decompensation remains somewhat unclear: it is possible that you had a pulmonary embolism as you had paused coumadin, but this seems unlikely given the speed at which you recovered.
More likely, this was all due to the severe infection (cellulitis) in your leg and high fevers.
