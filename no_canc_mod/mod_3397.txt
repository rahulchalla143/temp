Afterwards she had only epistaxis but denied headache or LOC.
At [**Hospital1 **], a head CT showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage so she was transferred here for neurosurgical evaluation.
She was initially awake, alert and oriented with a normal neuro exam in their ED, but she developed a left facial droop and UE weakness during the ambulance ride.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was intubated upon arrival for airway protection secondary to worsening mental status and emesis/bloody secretions.
A repeat head CT here revealed large bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhages as well as a large right-sided intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
Another CT scan the morning after admission showed slight subfalcine herniation.
The MICU team did discuss anticoagulation with the patient's family on multiple occasions, including the risks and benefits of remaining off of the anticoagulation with her known atrial fibrillation and cardiac dysfunction.
In the ICU, she became febrile and was placed on vancomycin and meropenem for an 8 day course.
Bronchoscopy revealed diffuse friable mucosa in both bronchial trees and a small amount of thin secretions.
Status post vitreous hemorrhage in right eye and early retinopathy in both eyes as per the patient's ophthalmologist.
CAD status post anterior MI nine years ago, most recent cath [**6-28**] with 80% mLAD (not stented) and 90% LCx (stented w/DES) 4.
Ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 20% in [**12-28**], status post biventricular pacer internal defibrillator.
Atrial fibrillation.

There is a large amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage bilaterally.
Additionally, there is a large focus of intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right parietal region.
There is an area of low attenuation in the brain parenchyma eccentric and anterior to the area of hemorrhage.
This may represent edema due to the hematoma itself.
If the cause of this hemorrhage is unknown, then further evaluation with an MRI should be considered.
Minimal frontal soft tissue swelling.
There are areas of bilateral subarachnoid and right-sided intraparenchymal hemorrhage seen, which are better and more completely evaluated on the dedicated CT scan of the head performed at the same time.
[**11-26**] CT C-spine No fracture or subluxation is identified.
Degenerative changes, including anterior and posterior marginal osteophyte formation are noted, predominantly at the C4-C5 level.
There may be mild canal narrowing at the C4-C5 level, with abutment of the posterior osteophytes on the anterior contour of the thecal sac.
CT provides limited evaluation of intrathecal contents, however, contour of thecal sac is within normal limits.
There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling.
[**11-26**] X-ray Left Knee - no fracture.
[**11-26**] X-ray Pelvis - no fracture.
[**11-26**] f/u CT Head w/o Contrast No significant change in appearance of extensive subarachnoid and right intraparenchymal hemorrhage, but with slight increase in surrounding edema and leftward subfalcine herniation.
[**11-27**] f/u CT Head w/o Contrast Slight increase in edema surrounding right intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with increased mass effect and leftward subfalcine herniation, especially when compared to original study performed at on [**2190-11-26**].
No fractures identified.
Two views of the forearm demonstrate normal bony alignment without fracture.
Diagnostic considerations again include pulmonary edema and pneumonia.
Improved left lower lobe atelectasis, pulmonary edema and right lower lobe consolidation which was most likely due to a relatively asymmetric edema.
[**12-4**] CT Head w/o Contrast No significant interval change in the large right cerebral intraparenchymal hemorrhage and extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage, with a similar degree of right-to-left subfalcine herniation.
Interval opacification of right mastoid air cells.
No coiling of the tube in the thoracic portion of the esophagus.
[**12-10**] Portable CXR Worsening pulmonary edema.
Brief Hospital Course: Mrs. [**Known lastname 19205**] is a 71 year old female with coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation on coumadin who presented status post a fall with bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhages and large right intraparenchymal bleed initially cared for in the MICU now extubated and improving on the general medical floor.
She has a dense left hemiplegia including left facial droop.
The patient should continue on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
Having said this, they did recommend a repeat CT scan when her coumadin level becomes therapeutic.
Both the patient's husband and daughter [**Name (NI) **] understand that there is risk with both options: anticoagulation versus no anticoagulation in the setting of atrial fibrillation with depressed ejection fraction.
They understand that without anticoagulation, the patient is at risk for embolic stroke due to her atrial fibrillation.
However, on anticoagulation, there is no guarantee that the patient's intracranial bleed would not progress.
# Respiratory failure: The patient was initially intubated due to aspiration of blood from epistaxis as well as deteriorating mental status.
In the ICU, she had a prolonged wean from the ventilator due to congestive heart failure, requiring diuresis.
Her course was also complicated by ventilator associated pneumonia, for which she was treated with approprite antibiotics during her MICU stay.
- On the floor, the patient was restarted on her prior dose of lasix due to concern for continued element of congestive heart failure.
# Atrial fibrillation: The patient is paced.
They understand her risk for embolic stroke while not on coumadin.
# CHF: The patient's ejection fraction is 20% on most recent echocardiogram which is felt due to ischemic cardiomyopathy.
- She also received PO lasix as above for volume overload.
Since her admission, she has been restarted on aspirin, but her plavix is still being held secondary to her intracranial hemorrhage.
Her anemia in the ICU is likely due to frequent phlebotomy during her ICU course.
Her guaiac positive stool could be due to Dobhoff placement.
# FEN: Ms. [**Known lastname 19205**] [**Last Name (Titles) 19206**] demonstrate a likely metabolic alkalosis, but her bicarbonate is stable at 34.
She did receive diamox in the ICU for elevated bicarbonate but we did not pursue this on the floow.
As the patient's speech and swallow study was somewhat confounded by her depressed mental status, her family would like to continue for now with tube feeds.
Artificial Tear with Lanolin 0.1-0.1 % Ointment Sig: One (1) Appl Ophthalmic  PRN (as needed).

Bisacodyl 10 mg Suppository Sig: One (1) Suppository Rectal HS (at bedtime) as needed for constipation.
