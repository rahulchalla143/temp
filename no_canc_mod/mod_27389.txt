her mother's prenatal course was significant for an admission on [**12-22**], with proteinuria at which time she received betamethasone with no signs of HELLP syndrome.
An ultrasound showed abruption at this time.
In addition, mother's medical history is significant for type 1 diabetes, insulin- dependent, followed by the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetic Center.
Diabetes was complicated by retinopathy, status post laser surgery to the left eye due to retinal detachment and also complicated by mild nephropathy.
Mother also has a history of chronic hypertension and was on lisinopril before pregnancy but no medication during pregnancy for blood pressure management.
The patient was noted to have cyanosis and mild respiratory distress and received blow by oxygen in the NICU.
There was no maternal fever, unknown GBS status.
Upon admission to the NICU, the baby was noted to have a large amount of oral secretions and increased work of breathing at which time an oxygen saturation was 67% and she was receiving blow by oxygen.
She was initially placed on CPAP but still had increased work of breathing at which time was intubated and administered Surfactant.
The remainder of the physical exam was significant for respiratory distress requiring intubation, no murmur noted.
She has no history of spells and no history of caffeine use.
Cardiovascular: She was stable from the time of admission with no hypotension or pressor support.
FEN/GI: Initially, this baby had low [**Name (NI) 72453**] secondary to maternal diabetes; hypoglycemia resolved quickly with D10W IV infusion.
Initially, we had a trial of Similac 20 as her weight gain had been so good on Similac 24, however, on Similac 20, she would have poor weight gain so she has been switched back to Similac 24 for discharge.
She may be weaned back to Similac 20 as weight gain continues.
She received no blood product transfusions.
Antibiotics discontinued thereafter without further sepsis workup.
Head ultrasound was not indicated and she remained asymptomatic from a neurologic standpoint.
Ophthalmology: Ophthalmology screening for retinopathy of prematurity was not indicated in light of her gestational age of 34 weeks.
Born between 32 and 35 weeks     with 2 of the following: Daycare during RSV season, a     smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway     abnormalities or school age sibling, and 3.
Before this age and for the first 24     months of the child's life, immunization against     influenza is recommended for household contacts and out     of home caregivers.
Respiratory distress secondary to hyaline membrane disease, resolved.
