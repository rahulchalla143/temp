He describes the headache as a dull, throbbing sensation located in bifrontal region and was [**7-6**] on the pain scale.
His wife reports that she has a history of HTN but not currenlty on any medications.
He denies any photophobia, blurry vision, weakness or paresthesia  Past Medical History: none  Social History: RH, married with 1 child, unemployed, worked as a chemist, lives in [**Location (un) 3307**], no ETOH/Smoke   Family History: Father history of aneurysm   Physical Exam: On Admission: Hunt and [**Doctor Last Name 9381**]:1  [**Doctor Last Name **]:  3     GCS 15  E:4 V:5 Motor: 6 O: T:96.8  BP: 221/104 174/96  HR: 68   R 18      O2Sats 97% Gen: pleasant, cooperative, abrasion right forehead WD/WN, comfortable, NAD.
No dysarthria or paraphasic errors.
V, VII: Facial strength and sensation intact with mild nasolabila droop on the left.
No abnormal movements, tremors.
Reflexes: B T Br Pa Ac Right    2+----------- Left     2+-----------  Toes downgoing bilaterally  Coordination: normal on finger-nose-finger intact  Discharge: Neurologically intact   Pertinent Results: CT without contrast OSH [**4-20**] - diffuse SAH with basal and mesencephalic cisterns and along the skull base.
There is mild blood in the left posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
There is a bilateral intraventricular mass with calcified portion on the left.
There is evidence of hydrocephalus with temporal horns are prominent.
Intraventricular hemorrhage in both occipital horns and the fourth ventricle.
Diffuse cerebral edema, with effacement of the sulci.
Hyperdense intraventricular mass with calcifications occupying the body of both lateral ventricles.
CTA Head: Large intraventricular AVM with the nidus in the body of the left lateral ventricle, with dilated venous varix in the body of the right lateral ventricle.
Arterial feeders to the AVM from a dilated left ACA and from the left MCA.
A third fusiform aneurysm in the left A3 segment [**Last Name (un) **] 4mm.
Echo [**4-20**] - Small LV cavity size with hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
Consequently there is a mild left ventricular outflow tract gradient during systole.
No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
EF >75%  [**4-21**] ANGIOGRAM******  [**2196-4-24**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM Conclusions There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
No left ventricular apical aneurysm is seen Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Not different from the previous study ([**2196-4-20**])  [**2196-4-26**] FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
Wide-spread parenchymal opacity has mildly increased in extent.
No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Mild worsening of bilateral parenchymal opacities  CTA head [**2196-4-26**] 1.
No evidence of flow-limiting stenosis or occlusion within the anterior or posterior intracranial circulations.
No evidence of acute large vascular territorial infarction.
The degree of intraventricular hemorrhage layering in the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles is not significantly changed.
No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.
The known bilateral apical parenchymal opacities are unchanged in extent and severity.
No pleural effusions.
No pneumothorax.
No overt pulmonary edema.
Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
Chest X-ray [**2196-4-29**] Previous moderately severe pulmonary edema has largely resolved.
Thoracic aorta is generally large but not focally aneurysmal, and pleural effusion is minimal if any.
No pneumothorax.
Right PIC catheter ends in the upper right atrium approximately 2.5 cm below the anticipated location of superior cavoatrial junction.
No pneumothorax.
BLE LENIS [**2196-4-29**] IMPRESSION: No DVT in the right or left lower extremity.
A CT-Angiogram revealed multiple aneuryms and a large intraventricular Arteriovenous malformation with feeders from L MCA/ACA with drainage into straight sinus.
Subsequently, he was taken for a cerebral angiogram on [**4-21**] and had a basilar tip aneurysm coiled.
On [**4-22**], he was having some trouble with his respiratory status and a CXR showed pulmonary edema.
CXR showed no interval change.
He was transferred to floor status on [**4-29**] and discharged home on [**5-1**] with no interveral events.

You make take Tylenol or prescribed pain medications for any post procedure pain or discomfort.
Your incision may be left uncovered, unless you have small amounts of drainage from the wound, then place a dry dressing or band aid over the area that is draining, as needed ??????
No driving until you are no longer taking pain medications   Followup Instructions: Please follow-up with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in 4 weeks with a MRI/MRA w/ & w/o contrast ([**Doctor Last Name **] protocol).
