She states that all symptoms feel identical to when she had DKA 10 years ago.
In the ED, initial vs were: T97.6 HR111 BP138/66 RR20 O2sat 100% RA She had a K of 4.0 and an anion gap of 21, a normal CXR, EKG with <1mm ST depressions that may have been rate dependent (no priors for comparison), and a UA with 1000 glucose and ketones.
She felt much better, no longer nauseated and no more chest pressure.
- Tobacco:  none - Alcohol:  5 glasses wine/week - Illicits:  none   Family History: Mom died of CHF at 87; father died of old age, seven siblings who are all healthy   Physical Exam: Admission Physical Exam: Vitals: HR 93, BP 115/54, RR 14, O2 sat 99 (RA).
General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, ronchi CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops Abdomen: +BS, soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, Ext: warm, well-perfused, no edema .
Microbiology:  no cultures sent .
The lungs are clear with no evidence of consolidations, effusions, or pneumothoraces.
ETT: INTERPRETATION: 55 yo woman with h/o DM on insulin x 36 years was referred for evaluation of ST segment changes while tachycardic in ED being treated for diabetic ketoacidosis.
The exercise test was stopped due to fatigue.
No chest, back, neck or arm discomforts were reported by the patient during the procedure.
In the presence of nonspecific baseline ST segment changes, less than 0.5 mm of additional ST segment depression was noted inferiorly.
The rhythm was sinus with no ectopy noted.
IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or objective ECG evidence of myocardial ischemia at a high cardiac demand and average exercise tolerance.
Brief Hospital Course: 55F with PMH of IDDM with insulin pump presents with general malaise and tachycardia, found to have DKA.
At the time of presentation to the ICU, the patient's glucose remained elevated at 364.
She had metabolic acidosis with anion gap of 21 when she presented to the ED, which on arrival to the ICU had closed to 11.
Although she had an elevated WBC, she was afebrile and had a normal CXR and UA.
Her GI distress had resolved.
Given her clinical resolution, there was no evidence of infection and no further testing was done.
Her elevated WBC was suspected to be an inflammatory response to the DKA iself.
The GI distress she reported (nausea and vomiting) may have been a result of the DKA, but may have been causal.
# EKG changes:  ST depression was noted in inferolateral leads while tachycardic in the ED.
These ST depressions disappeared after her heart rate slowed down.
This was suspicious for demand ischemia while tachycardic.
She complained of some chest pain overnight on [**8-31**] and given this and her EKG changes, a ETT was done, which was negative (see above for details).
#Fibromyalgia:  Patient was diagnosed 2 years ago for general aches and cramps.
4. insulin pump syringe  Miscellaneous   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Diabetic ketoacidosis   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis, likely due to pump malfunction.
On admission, your heart rate was fast and you had some minor changes to your EKG.
You also noted some intermittent chest pain.
