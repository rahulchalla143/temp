She injured her left ankle stepping in a pothole about two weeks ago and subsequently developed left calf cramping which she attributed to her injury.
This continued until today, when she got up from a chair and noticed acute onset dyspnea.
Her calf pain stopped right about the same time.
She noticed chest discomfort and lightheadedness at that time.
She went to an OSH where a CTA was positive for a large saddle embolus.
She remained tachycardic but o/w HD stable and satting in the upper 90s on RA.
A bedside echo showed moderate RV dilation and mild pulm HTN.
Review of sytems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

There is PE extending into nearly every lobar segment.
There is apparent flattening of interventricular septum which could reflect right heart strain.
No pathologically enlarged node is noted.
No pericardial effusion is visualized.
No pleural effusion is noted.
Linear atelectatic changes of the lingula and right middle lobe noted.
There is no evidence of infarct.
No worrisome nodules.
BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
IMPRESSION: Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli with possible right heart strain.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with focal basal free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricular cavity with basal right ventricular hypokinesis and right ventricular pressure and volume overload consistent with right ventricular strain in the setting of pulmonary emboli.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: 46 yo female with no PMH who presents with DVT/PE in the setting of OCPs and left ankle injury.
DVT/PE: Presented with submassive pulmonary embolism with evidence of right heart strain on CT and ECHO.
Known risk factors include recent left ankle injury with immobilization and longterm OCP use.
Age-appropriate cancer screening is up- to- date and no family hx to suggest prothrombotic state.
Large clot burden with some evidence of RH strain but HD stable.
Monitored on telemetry for first 24hrs of hospital stay with no evidence of arrhythmia.
Started on vitamin D and calcium given risks of osteoporosis with LMWH.
Disp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Diagnosis: submassive pulmonary embolism  Secondary Diagnosis: long term oral contraceptive use left ankle injury   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: You were transferred to [**Hospital3 **] with a large pulmonary embolism, or blood clot in your lungs.
In addition, because many medications may interact with Lovenox and increase the risk of bleeding, please check with your doctor before taking over-the-counter medication or herbal supplements.
