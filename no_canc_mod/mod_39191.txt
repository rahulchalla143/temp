He was taken to OSH where exam showed minimal strength in UE's and LE's.
CT C spine showed no fx, MRI T/L spine showed degenerative changes but did capture C5-C6 stenosis and cord signal change.
He has no dedicated C spine MRI.
Past Medical History: - ASD repair at 18 yrs old at [**Hospital3 1810**], then followed every few years by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] - Bradycardia -- followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14677**] at [**Location (un) 270**] Cardiology (after Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] retired) in [**Location (un) **], MA [**Telephone/Fax (1) 92177**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 92178**] - Seizures since [**24**] yrs old previously on Tegretol currently on Depakote, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] - S/p L nephrectomy - IVC filter - EtOH abuse - Rotator cuff tear - Hernia repair   Social History: Prior 2ppd smoker but now cut down to 1/2 ppd, smoked for 30 yrs.
Reflexes: B T Pa Ac Right     0 0 2  0 Left      0 0 2  0  Toes mute No rectal tone  At discharge:[**3-15**] His is a cervical collar.
His wound is clean and dry with staples in place.
Pertinent Results: Trauma scan [**2118-3-7**]  Mildly enlarged heart.
No evidence of intrathoracic trauma  CT Torso [**2118-3-7**] 1.
No evidence of intra-abdominal or intrathoracic injury.
No evidence of acute fracture.
Abnormal signal intensity involving C3 to C6 vertebral bodies concerning for bone marrow edema/contusions with prevertebral soft tissue edema.
Increased spinal cord signal from C4 to C6 levels as described above may represent spinal cord edema/contusion or prior myelopathic changes.
Increased signal also seen in the posterior paraspinal soft tissues and in the interspinous spaces extending from C2 to C7 levels concerning for interspinous ligament injury.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal awake and drowsy portable EEG because of occasional right frontotemporal epileptiform discharges indicative of a potential epileptogenic focus in this region.
There is one marked event with arousal-related myoclonic jerk most likely representing a hypnic jerk.
Lungs are clear with no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax demonstrated.
Minimal right basal opacity most likely reflects area of atelectasis, better appreciated on the CT torso from [**3-7**], [**2118**].
LENS [**2118-3-14**] DVT with small focal nonocclusive clot seen in the right popliteal vein.
He was taken to an OSH where c-spine imaging revealed stenosis and he was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further neurosurgical evaluation.
MRI c-spine revealed stenosis at C4-6 with T2 signal changes.
On [**3-8**], his exam revealed weakness in his bilateral triceps and IPs.
FSBS was stable / his VS were stable except for his persistent bradycardia.
Cardiology consult was called the following am: They felt that there was a negligible risk of endocarditis and that antibiotic prophylaxis was not recommended.
EEG was done and this showed some occasional right frontotemporal epileptiform discharges indicative of a potential epileptogenic focus in this region.
Nephrology was contact[**Name (NI) **] due to his history of left nephrectomy, decreased clearing at right kidney during torso scan and elevated BUN/creatinine.
Pm labs on [**3-9**] showed a drop in Creat from 1.5 to 1.2 and drop in Bun from 39 to 35 and K was 4.4.
Urine studies were sent due to high UO.
He was cleared medically for the OR and he went for C3-7 posterior laminectomies and fusion on [**3-11**].
He tolerated the procedure very well with no complications.
His Foley was removed but he was unable to void on his own and had over 1L on bladder scan and the catheter was replaced.
On [**3-14**] he had LENIS and this showed R popliteal non occlusive DVT.
He was found to be anisocoric but has no other neurologic change.

11. theophylline 200 mg Tablet Extended Release 12 hr Sig: One (1) Tablet Extended Release 12 hr PO BID (2 times a day) as needed for bradycardia.
PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.

?Please return to the office in [**8-2**] days (from date of surgery) for removal of your staples/sutures and/or a wound check.
