The pain began after a "stomach virus" prior to [**Holiday **] that caused her to have large amounts of "black" emesis (no diarrhea or melena).
After the stomach virus she developed a gnawing epigastric pain.
She denies fever or chills at home, but endorses sweats, 10lb weight loss, and mid-back pain.
Since the patient presented to OSH with abdominal pain on [**2118-12-18**] she has continued to have epigastric pain.
She improved in terms of her pain and tolerating clears, but then had recurrence of her pain without fevers or chills, 2 days prior to transfer.
Notably, Alk phos increased  from 140 to 400, but with normal ALT/AST (had been slightly elevated previously).
The pt had a repeat Abd CT [**2118-12-25**] with new enlarging cyst roughly 5cm.
Also, noted SMV thrombosis which was not seen on admit CT, but per discussion with pt's outpatient gastroenterologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], she has had this before and anticoagulation was discontinued.
MRI was done which showed e/o chronic inflammation and narrowing of pancreatic duct (no comment biliary pathology but was not an MRCP).
OSH discussed case with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who requested patient be transferred for further evaluation and consideration of J-tube placement if symptoms persist.
Abdominal pain improves with morphine, not worse with clears PO intake.
Of note, the patient had occasional fevers (Tm 101.5) during the hospitalization at OSH, and had a urine culture that grew 80,000 Ecoli (pansensitive) from [**2118-12-18**] that was not treated as the pt was considered "asymptomatic."
Her WBC remained elevated during her hospitalization at 15,000.
Past Medical History: chronic alcoholic pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic duct stones, multiple pseudocysts SMV thrombosis, not on anticoagulation   Social History: She is a waitress, currently not employed.
NECK: Supple, no thyromegaly, no JVD, no carotid bruits.
ABDOMEN: Soft/NT/ND, no masses or HSM, no rebound/guarding.
SKIN: No rashes or lesions.
NEURO: Awake, A&Ox3, CNs II-XII grossly intact, muscle strength [**4-29**] throughout, sensation grossly intact throughout, DTRs 2+ and symmetric, cerebellar exam intact, steady gait.
Pertinent Results: WBC 12.9 Hct 30.1 Plt 428 INR 1.5 Cr 0.4 Tbil 0.3 Dbil <0.1 AST 19 ALT 28 Alk Phos 414 Tprot 7.1 Alb 2.8  OSH MRI Abd [**2118-12-28**] Majority of pancreas is replaced by heterogenous fluid collections and ill-defined soft-tissue/fibrosis.
Moderate peripancr inflam change.
Loculated fluid collection b/w pancreatic neck and left lobe liver which measures 3.8cmx3.3cm.
Multiple other fluid collections.
Increasing size of hemorrhagic pseudocyst within the lesser sac compressing upon the gastric antrum and duodenum.
No evidence of active contrast extravasation.
Conventional anatomy of the celiac axis with well-visualized gastroduodenal artery without active bleeding.
Conventional anatomy of the SMA origin with active extravasation seen from a small branch of the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery.
Active extravasation of a branch of the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery, which could not be selectively catheterized.
Brief Hospital Course: After being admitted to the ICU, she had several problems which were managed there:  -Acute blood loss anemia/GI bleeding/hematemesis: Patient has not been forthcoming with active bleeding via emesis and per rectum - with ?depression given significant flat affect.
While on the floor, patient was noted to have significant upper and lower GI bleeding with hct drop from 28->22, for which she was transferred to the ICU and kept on PPI drip.
ERCP performed EGD and noted significant amounts of blood, no active bleed and likely external compression by a pseudocyst, which was eroding into the pylorus/duodenum.
She was taken to IR who found bleeding from the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery but this was too small to embolize.
After the scope, on [**12-31**], the patient then did not have any bleeding.
-Acute on chronic pancreatitis, abdominal pain: History of pancreatitis is felt to be due to alcohol abuse.
Her pancreatitis has been complicated by pseudocysts and thrombi (likely from cirrhosis).
-Fever/leukocytosis - The patient has been afebrile at [**Hospital1 18**] but with persistent and worsening leukocytosis.
-Liver cirrhosis - Unclear but does not seem to have been previously complicated by ascites, SBP, variceal bleeding, encephalopathy.
Patient with known gastroepiploic varices, no esophageal varices.
-Elevated alk phos: Most likely biliary, possibly in setting of recent alcohol consumption/cirrhosis.
However, upper and lower GI bleeding with significant hct drop propmted her transfer to the ICU.
Patient had 2 isolated episodes of massive GIB from above and below, each requiring significant transfusions.
She has not had any evidence of bleeding either clinically or lab since being transferred to the floor.
Her antibiotic course finished on [**1-9**], and she experienced no additional GI bleeding.
Her abdominal pain resolved, and her labs remained stable.
On [**1-9**], she was tolerating a regular diet, reporting no abdominal symptoms, and ambulating independently.
She will call to schedule outpatient nutrition follow up, as well as to schedule an appointment with her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 7 days to discuss elevated glucose while inpatient without a prior diagnosis of diabetes.
