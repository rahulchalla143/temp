Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname 101787**] was evaluated by the Acute Care service in the Emergency Room and based on exam and xray had an incarcerated right inguinal hernia and surgery was recommended emergently.
He was taken to the Operating Room on [**2113-9-15**] and underwent repair of a strangulated right inguinal hernia with ileocolectomy and lysis of adhesions.
Soon thereafter he developed elevated bladder pressures, a decreasing hematocrit and some hypotension requiring bedside exploratory laparotomy with resection of some necrotic small bowel with subsequent discontinuity.
He also developed a left pneumothorax following central line placement requiring chest tube placement with complete re-expansion of the lung.
He underwent vigorous chest PT and incentive spirometry and remained free of any other pulmonary complications.
His hematocrit was stable in the 28 range for days but on [**2113-9-24**] it gradually decreased and eventually he developed melena without any other symptoms.
He felt better and his melena stopped.
He is still guiac positive but his stools are formed, brown and his hematocrit today is 33.
Postoperative bleeding and small bowel necrosis Acute blood loss anemia Left pneumothorax   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Your surgery was complicated by bleeding which required a second operation with removal of part of your small bowel.
The bowel was not reconnected due to swelling.
* In order to get you back home we are sending you to a short term rehab so that you may work on Physical Therapy, eat a bit more and get stronger.
* You need to follow up with the surgeon in [**12-21**] weeks or earlier if any new symptoms develop.
