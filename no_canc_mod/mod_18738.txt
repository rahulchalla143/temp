Admission Date:  [**2128-7-27**]              Discharge Date:   [**2128-8-1**]  Date of Birth:  [**2060-7-11**]             Sex:   F  Service: MEDICINE  Allergies: Codeine  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**] Chief Complaint: Chest Pain  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Pericardiocentesis Red Blood Cell Transfusion   History of Present Illness: The patient is a 68-year-old woman with CAD s/p DES to RCA, dCHF, HTN, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and PVD, who presented to her PCP today with chest discomfort.
She has had chest discomfort since 9pm one day PTA, which spread across her chest from shoulder to shoulder.
She did have mild SOB [**3-15**] pain on inspiration, and she found it suffocating while she had her CPAP on overnight.
This morning she continued to have pain, as well as some radiation to the back.
The pain is different from her angina and from the pain she experienced with her heart failure.
She did not have any associated nausea, lightheadedness, or diaphoresis.
On arrival she had increased pain with transfer from gurney to stretcher, and was found to have ST elevations in II, III, aVF.
On arrival to the cath lab here, her ECG was felt to be more consistent with pericarditis.
STAT TTE showed a small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion (~2cm in subcostal view, anterior to the RV) with sustained RA collapse c/w low filling pressures or early tamponade, and RV collapse could not be excluded.
She reportedly did not have any wall motion abnormalities.
Of note, the patient had "allergy" symptoms yesterday prior to developing the chest pain.

======================================================== Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2128-7-27**] at 6:17:09 PM There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion.
There is sustained right atrial collapse, consistent with low filling pressures or early tamponade.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Suboptimal image quality.
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Trivial pericardial effusion.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is a small pericardial effusion localized posterior to the left ventricle.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Brief Hospital Course: # Pericarditis, pericardial effusion, tamponade: Patient transferred from OSH for concern for STEMI given ST elevations in inferior and pre-cordial leads.
However, on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ECG felt to be more consistent with pericarditis.
A stat TTE showed small to moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion (~2cm in subcostal view, anterior to the RV) with sustained RA collapse c/w low filling pressures or early tamponade, and RV collapse could not be excluded.
She reportedly did not have any wall motion abnormalities.
Post-procedure ECHO demonstrated trivial pericardial effusion and ECHO 24 hrs post-procedure demonstrated small pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade.
She has continued to have mild chest discomfort relieved with tramadol.
Notably, ESR elevated at 83.
Pericardial fluid was negative for malignant cells.
She would need a repeat ECHO if her symptoms of chest discomfort recurred.
# CORONARIES: Pt w/ known CAD and s/p DES to RCA lesion in [**2126**].
As noted above, patient was transferred to this hospital for concern that she was having a STEMI but we determined her ST elevations actually reflected pericarditis.
# PUMP: Patient has history of CHF exacerbation in [**2127**].
No evidence of volume overload.Continued on outpatient regimen of metoprolol and lasix.
# Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated on admission to 1.7 and rose as high as 2.1.
She was volume resucitated with IVF and creatinine improved back to 1 which is within her baseline range (0.8-1.0).
# Leukocytosis: Patient had leukocytosis on admission with WBC ct of 15.
This was likely related to the inflammatory process causing her pericardial effusion.
# Diabetes: Pt w/ DM2 x20yrs, previously on medical therapy with metformin / rosiglitazone and insulin, but has been off medications and insulin due to weight loss of ~50lbs in setting of lifestyle changes.
Possible that low lipid levels reflect an inflammatory process, which we are suspecting already given her pericardial effusion.
# PVD: No active issues.
# Anemia: iron studies indicate iron deficiency anemia given iron level of 18.
