CXR PA/Lat [**2147-2-27**]: Small posterior stable effusions versus pleural thickening.
Resolving small pulmonary edema.
No pneumonia or CHF.
Brief Hospital Course: 85 year old with history of hypertension presented to the OSH with acute pulmonary edema secondary to hypertension in the setting of aortic stenosis.
Echocardiogram was performed on [**2147-2-24**] which showed EF>65% and severe aortic valve stenosis.
She was started on low dose losartan given that she has aortic stenosis and did not tolerate lisinopril.
Beta blockade was deferred as it will reduce inotropy and was thought to be deleterious given the aortic stenosis.
Cardiac: Patient had coronary artery disease and underwent catheterization with intervention (DES in rPL).
There was no evidence of MI on ECG and cycled cardiac enzymes were flat.
She presented with CHF and required brief intubation for pulmonary edema.
Echocardiogram [**2147-2-24**] revealed EF>65% with severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8).
Beta blockade is deferred given the severity of aortic stenosis (would prefer to have the inotropy).
The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm and was without adverse events on telemetry monitoring.
Bacteremia: Patient developed ceftriaxone sensitive S. pneumoniae bacteremia identified when one of four blood culture bottles was positive.
The likely source is the lung with CXR on [**2-24**] post extubation suggestive of a right lower lobe opacity near an effusion.
Repeat CXR on day of discharge was negative for pneumonia or CHF.
Chronic Anemia: The patient has a known iron deficiency anemia for which she takes iron supplementation and has refused colonoscopy.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital6 85**] - [**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: coronary artery disease aortic stenosis other: hypertension chronic iron deficiency anemia emphysema urinary incontinence cataract   Discharge Condition: stable  Discharge Instructions: Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you have chest pain/shortness of breath/dizziness or if there are any concerns at all.
