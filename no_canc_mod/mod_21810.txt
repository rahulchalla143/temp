There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function.
No structural cardiac cause of syncope identified.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan (ICU Course): 57M history of ESRD started HD  on [**2141-7-31**], CAD s/p MI 3 years prior, DM2, HTN, HL who presented with syncope on [**2141-7-29**] admitted for observation in the setting of ESRD/initiation of HD with hospital course complicated by "unresponsiveness" episode on [**7-31**] with spontaneous resolution concerning for dialysis disequilibrium syndrome vs vasovagal syncope.
# Unresponsive episode Patient had "unresponsiveness" episode during dialysis with no loss of pulse or respirations.
His vital signs showed abnormal heart rate and blood pressure that resolved during final portion of session.
He could have the aforementioned dialysis disequilibrium syndrome given high BUN, first dialysis session, nausea/vomiting; otherwise may represent a repeat syncopal episode.
There is no malignant arrhythmia although does appear he had bradycardia, primary neurogenic process such as seizure (recovered quite fast) is unlikely, no evidence of hypoglycemia, or other concerning features of his episode.
Serial ECG did not suggest ischemia although troponin continues to be elevated in the setting of his ESRD.
Patient received second session of hemodialysis at bedside in ICU and remained asymptomatic with no events or hemodynamic instability during session.
He was advised that he should not drive while he starts dialysis as an outpatient given his syncopal episodes.
If his symptoms persist, the patient was instructed to follow up in our neurology clinic where his diagnosis of disequilibrium syndrome may be worked up further.
No post-ictal to suggest neurologic etiology.
Arrhythmogenic etiology is not favored due to lack of symptoms and prolonged prodrome given no malignant rhythm detected during hospitalization in first 48 hours or during dialysis.
Trop/CK elevation likely secondary to ESRD; MI is not favored here as etiology for syncope.
ECHO without significant valvular lesions or explanation for syncope.
The patient was monitored on telemetry throughout his hospital stay with no malignant rhythms noted  #ESRD: BUN/Cr elevated compared to 2 weeks prior, likely in the setting of aggressive diuresis with torsemide/metolazone.
Regardless, his laboratory abnormalities suggested that he would require dialysis.
He received two episodes of hemodialysis at time of MICU call out with the assistance of a renal consultation.
#CAD: s/p MI 3 years prior, not on any cardiac medications for unclear reason.
Not having chest pain/discomfort, EKG reassuring.
The patient was started aspirin 81mg QD for prophylaxis.
A statin was not initiated given that the patient complains of proximal muscle cramping in the setting of an elevated CK.
#DM2: A1c measured at ~6.5, and during his hospital course his insulin requirement decreased quickly due to reduction in renal clearance.
The patient was continued on home doses of amlodipine and enalapril for this chronic issue.
Vitamin D 50,000 UNIT PO 1X/WEEK ([**Doctor First Name **]) 8. sevelamer CARBONATE 1600 mg PO TID W/MEALS RX *sevelamer carbonate [Renvela] 800 mg 2 tablet(s) by mouth three times a day Disp #*180 Tablet Refills:*0   Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Syncope Initiation of dialysis Chronic kidney disease   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Discharge Instructions: Mr. [**Known lastname **],  As you know you were seen in the hospital for evaluation of your fainting and to start dialysis.
We found no irregular heart rhythms and an ultrasound study of your heart was normal.
We talked with the neurologists who agreed with us that you were not having a seizure and these episodes are likely related to transient changes in your blood pressure.
You had an episode of unresponsiveness while you were having your first dialysis session, but the kidney doctors think that this was probably related to the changes that your body was going through in your first session.
You had no major complications in your later sessions.
We made the following changes to your medications: Started: -Aspirin -Nephrocaps -Sevelamer Carbonate  Stopped: -Torsemide -Rosuvastatin  Followup Instructions: Name: [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 56756**], MD Specialty: Primary Care When: Friday [**8-11**] at 9am Location: [**Location (un) 2274**]-[**University/College **] Address: [**Hospital1 3470**], [**University/College **],[**Numeric Identifier 31449**] Phone: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 56757**]  Please discuss with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] about seeing a neurologist for your recurrent syncopal episodes.
