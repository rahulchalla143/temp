Patient reports worsening difficulty breathing for the past 3 days.
Patient describes shortness of breath with exertion (transfering to and from wheelchair) that was at its worse today, and was associated with chest burning which lasted one hour.
Patient denies any frank pain, arm / neck / jaw pain or tingling, did not experience palpitations or syncope / presyncope/ lightheadedness.
Per Transfer note, pt coplained of shortness of breath and chest pain at rehab facility.
Pt given SL Nitro with good effect, however with new recurrent episode shortly thereafter EMS was called and patient trasnferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
Patients ECG obtained and concerning given worsened ST elevations in setting of LBBB.
After evaluation by cardiology fellow, clinical presentation felt to be more suggestive of volume overload and hyperkalemia.
Patient remained chest pain free while in the ED, no urine output was recorded.

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2142-6-15**]):       MODERATE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
Coronary angiography in this left-dominant system revealed diffuse coronary artery disease.
The LMCA was a small caliber vessel without disease.
The LAD had 60-70% calcified stenoses of the proximal section, as well as the diagonal branch, and was occluded after the mid-section.
The LCX had sequential stenoses of the proximal and distal LCX, with occluded OM1 and OM2 branches, and total occlusion after the distal LCX.
Selective graft venography revealed a widely patent SVG-PDA and LPL graft.
The SVG-OM1 graft had a 30-40% stenosis in the mid-SVG, and was patent to the OM1 branch.
Selective graft arteriography revealed a widely patent LIMA-LAD graft.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided filling pressures, with mean RA pressure of 15 mmHg, and mean PCW pressure of 30 mmHg.
The wedge tracing was notable for a prominant v-wave with  pressure of 51 mmHg, consistent with possible mitral regurgitation.
There was mild pulmonary hypertension with mean PA pressure of 38 mmHg, and mild systemic hypertension, with SBP of 140mmHg.
There was no aortic stenosis detected by pullback technique.
Nonselective left subclavian injection revealed a 70% stenosis of the proximal left subclavian artery, with a 45 mmHg pressure drop across the stenotic lesion.
Diffuse coronary artery disease.
Elevated left- and right-sided filling pressures.
Mild pulmonary and systemic hypertension.
CXR ([**2142-6-10**]): IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, bilateral airspace opacity, right greater than left, concerning for pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions, also greater on the right.
Echo ([**2142-6-12**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
LV systolic function appears moderately-to-severelydepressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to akinesis of the posterior wall and hypokinesis of the inferior septum, anterior free wall, and apex.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
A possible discontinuity in the myocardium between the inferior and posterior wall at the basal level is seen.
This could represent a contained pseudoaneurysm of the left ventricle.
Severe coronary artery atherosclerosis.
Likely asymmetric pulmonary edema.
Contribution of drug reaction, for example amiodarone toxicity, pulmonary hemorrhage or aspiration cannot be assessed in the setting of cardiac decompensation.
Asbestos-related pleural plaques.
Mild-to-moderate emphysema apical predominant.
No extra- or intra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation.
No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage or hemorrhage in the left groin (the site of recent catheterization).
New bilateral basal consolidations, likely relate to aspiration.
Extensive atherosclerotic disease.
No evidence of acute cholecystitis or intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation.
A echogenic focus in the gallbladder neck measuring 1.2 cm, could either represent a polyp, adherent sludge or a non-calcified stone.
Follow-up evaluation upon resolution of acute symptoms is recommended.
Comparison of heart size obtained in portable AP position suggests mild regression of cardiac enlargement.
Although the diaphragmatic contours are now again visible, although blunting of the lateral pleural sinuses persists, indicating some remaining pleural effusion.
Previously described left internal jugular approach central venous line as well as a similar right-sided line persist.
The latter still carrying the Swan-Ganz catheter seen to reach the central portion of the right PA. No evidence of pneumothorax or newly developed discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates that would indicate the presence of pneumonia in this patient with leukocytosis.
Brief Hospital Course: ** PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE ON [**2142-6-23**] **  Mr. [**Known lastname 17029**] is a 65 year-old man with CAD s/p previous CABG who was admitted w/ shortness of breath, transferred to the CCU for SOB and hypoxia.
HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE- This was likely exacerbated in the setting of pulmonary edema with possible superimposed infection.
Volume overload and newly diagnosed mitral regurgitation also contributed to difficulty breathing.
Pt was intubated on [**6-12**] for increasing respiratory distress.
He was treated with an 8-day course of vanc/cefepime for aspiration pneumonia.
He was initially diuresed with lasix boluses and lasix drip, but due to poor urine output and increasing creatinine, drip was discontinued.
On [**6-14**], pt started diuresis with CVVHD for pulmonary edema in setting of worsening MR. CVVH was continued until [**6-18**].
Pt was extubated on [**6-17**], without complications.
ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Patient was clinically volume overloaded and cardiac catheterization showed evidence of new MR (but patent grafts).
Patient had little diuresis with IV lasix on the general medical floors, and was transfered to the CCU due to increasing oxygen requirement.
He required intubation in the setting of aspiration while on facemask, with desaturation to 70%.
Optimized afterload reduction in setting of new MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: This was likely in setting of poor forward flow (Fe Urea 16%) s/p CVVH.
ATRIAL FLUTTER: Patient demonstrated new slow aflutter in the CCU.
Of note, patient had left-sided subclavian stenosis (proximal LIMA) with disparate blood pressure in upper extremities.
[**Month (only) 116**] consider intervention for subclavian stenosis as outpatient (not done as inpatient in cath given the dye load and renal failure)  6.
TRANSAMINITIS: Pt's LFTs were consistent with cholestatic picture- he had a negative RUQ U/S and CT initially, but repeat RUQ showed a questionable stone in the gallbladder neck vs echogenic focus, but this was non- obstructing.
There could be some component of congestion, but could be also medication effect from Statin or Zosyn.
There were no signs of active bleeding on exam.
Pt underwent abdominal CT on [**6-14**] to rule-out retroperitoneal bleed given recent catheterization on [**6-11**].
There was no evidence of RP bleed on CT. His hemolysis labs were negative.
Diabetes mellitus type II: insulin was continued per outpatient regimen  9.
Diabetic foot ulcer: s/p R- TMA.
Incision was clean, no evidence of infection at this time, sutures intact.
# Lorazepam 0.5 mg every 4 hours as needed for anxiety.
# Temazepam 15 mg Capsule PO HS as needed for insomnia.
Lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 hours) as needed for anxiety.

Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
Discharge Instructions: You had trouble breathing and some chest pain.
You were transferred here and found to have a heart attack.
You had a cardiac catheterization which showed your arteries are open but you have a blockage in your subclavian vein.
You developed congestive heart failure and acute renal failure which is now resolved.
You also now have a heart rhythm called aflutter which is not dangerous but does put you at risk for a stroke.
