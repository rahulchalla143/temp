Minimal swelling on exam of either lower extremities.
For serious infections,          repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted          if third generation cephalosporins were used.
RADIOLOGY: RUQ ultrasound [**8-4**]: Gallbladder distended with numeous gallstones with diffuse gallbladder wall thickening 4mm.
Pain in RUQ.
No biliary duct dilation.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum .

Hospital course complicated by poor nutrition and citrobacter sepsis.
#Acute Cholecystitis complicated by Proteus Septicemia: Pt was admitted to OSH with presentation of acute cholecystitis and underwent cholecystostomy that was complicated by proteus septicemia of suspected biliary source.
There was concern for choledocholithiasis given history of gallstones and elevated total bilirubin.
ERCP with sphincterotomy performed on [**8-7**] and no gallstones were visualized in CBD.
#Left state 4 heel decubitus ulcer/osteomyelitis: He was found to have a badly infected decubitus heel ulcer on his left foot which was thought to be contributing to his declining clinical status.
He was transfused with 7 units of pRBCs during this period to compensate for significant operative losses and to keep his Hct up given his multiple medical comorbidities.
He had a lot of pain at incision site but this was well controlled with Dilaudid.
#Nutrition: Patient had difficulty eating on his own.
Primary team wanted to discontinue TPN given risk of infection from the line and preference for using the gut.
On [**9-8**], patient pulled out his dobhoff and refused to have it put back in.
However, at this time, pt appears to be increasing oral intake while on TPN.
# Citrobacter bactermia: Pt spiked a fever in early [**Month (only) 216**].
# Diabetes mellitus: Patient was on insulin, with complications of nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy.
# Heart failure, EF 30% and Renal injury: Pt was volume overloaded initially, found to respond well to 80 mg lasix [**Hospital1 **].
However, diuresis elevated the creatinine.
Echo revealed a hypokinetic left ventricle with poor EF.
# Atrial fibrillation: Rate controlled with Metoprolol, anti-coagulation with Coumadin which is currently being held for PEG tube placement.
# Guaiac positive stools:  Hemodynamically stable with stable blood levels during admission.

You had some difficulty with poor nutrition and required TPN, which is food through an IV.
Unfortunately, you contracted a blood stream infection during your lengthy stay in the hospital.
