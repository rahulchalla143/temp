The pain began the day previous and was epigastric in location and described as boring.
He attributed this to his usual gastritis secondary to NSAID use.
However, over the following day his pain worsened as was accompanied by anorexia, nausea, and an episode of non-bloody, vomitting on the morning of [**7-7**].
On admission, he had elevated lipase (2866) and amylase (981), serum glucose 211, white blood cell count 18.5K, AST 104, LDH not checked.
At that time, lab values also notable for elevated creatinine (1.6) and calcium 10.5, with hematocrit 54.5%.
Ultrasound of abdomen showed fatty infiltration of the liver, but the pancreas was not clearly visualized.

Brief Hospital Course: 32 year old man with a history of EtOH abuse presented with pancreatitis most likely related to chronic alcohol abuse.
Surgery was consulted but there was no evidence of necrotizing pancreatitis.
The abdominal pain improved on discharge.
The abdomen was increasingly distended over the first day and he was stooling only small amounts.
Repeated KUBs showed dilated right colon.
This was likely due to ileus secondary to opiates and acute pancreatitis.
He had 2L of oxygen requirement on floor with 80-85% ambulatory SaO2.
This was likely due to interstitial non cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
He had no evidence of congestive heart failure or hospital acquired pneumonia.
[**Doctor First Name **] was afebrile while on the floor and denied cough or sputum production.
He needs repeat CBC at next visit as this may be due to evolving pneumonia or pancreatic pseudocyst.
His exertional tachycardia was most likely sedondary to fluid sequestration from severe pancreatitis and from hypoxia due to interstitial pulmonary edema.
It was worse in the setting of pain and EtOH withdrawal.
His elevated LFTs are secondary to pancreatitis itself a component of liver disease [**3-20**] EtOH given fatty infiltration on recent US.
The macrocytic Anemia is due to combination of nutritional deficiency and EtOH.
Medications on Admission: None  Discharge Disposition: Home  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Acute alcoholic pancreatitis  Secondary: Alcohol withdrawal Hypertension Psoriatic arthritis   Discharge Condition: Stable, tolerating regular died, pain well managed.
Discharge Instructions: You admitted for severe acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol use.
While in the hospital you experienced symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and were treated with Valium to prevent serious complications of withdrawal.
Your pain improved and your pancreatic enzymes returned to [**Location 213**] levels.
You also experience some shortness of breath which can likely be attributed to the extra fluid and abdominal distention which made it difficult to take a deep breath.
New medications: Hydracholorothiazide 25mg by mouth once a day Atenolol 25mg by mouth twice a day Dilaudid 4mg by mouth every 4 hours prn abdominal pain (please limit use to only when necessary as this medication causes sedation, constipation, urinary retention, and carries a risk of addiction).
Please call PCP if you have worsening shortness of breath, productive cough, or fever for evaluation of pneumonia.
Also call your PCP if you develop chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or any other concerning symptom.
Please make continued effort to abstain from alcohol use as you are at increased risk for further injury to your pancreas.
