History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 15582**] is a 57 year old male with known coronary artery disease.
He had recent complaints of increasing dyspnea on exertion and chest discomfort.
Recent stress echo was "abnormal" showing an LVEF of 30% with anteroapical and inferobasal hypokinesis along with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
Past Medical History: Ischemic Cardiomyopathy Coronary Artery Disease, History of MI Prior PCI/Stenting - BMS to LCX in [**2143**], DES to LAD [**2148**] History of Brachytherapy in [**2144**] Mitral Regurgitation Hypertension Elevated Cholesterol Type II Diabetes Mellitus Gout History of Rheumatic Fever as child Vasectomy Tonsillectomy Prior Abdominal Surgery/Hernia Repair   Social History: Approximate 20 pack year history of tobacco, quit 14 years ago.
Family History: Mother suffered MI at age 51  Physical Exam: PREOP EXAM Vitals: 120/85, 100, 16 General: WDWN male in no acute distress HEENT: Oropharynx benign, EOMI Neck: Supple, no JVD Lungs: CTA bilaterally Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, normal s1s2, no murmur or rub Abdomen: Soft, nontender with normoactive bowel sounds Ext: Warm, no edema Pulses: 2+ distally Neuro: Alert and oriented, CN 2- 12 grossly intact, no focal deficits noted  Pertinent Results: [**2150-4-21**] Intraop TEE: PRE CPB - The left atrium is dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %).
There is some septal hypokinesis and the anterior wall is close to being akinetic.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
It is centrally directed and likely due to mitral annular dilitation.
There is inferior and inferolateral severe hypokinesis.
A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is in situ.
There is trivial mitral regurgitation.
Mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle persists.

Operative course was notable for prophylactic placement of an IABP given his very poor ejection fraction and severe mitral regurgitation.
Around postoperative day 2 to 3, developed atrial fibrillation for which he was started on Amiodarone.
Also started on broad spectrum antibiotics for postoperative fevers associated with copious, yellow respiratory secretions.
He continued to experience paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, but over several days, his heart rate and hemodynamics improved.
The IABP was eventually removed without complication and pressors were gradually weaned.
Sputum cultures eventually grew out Moraxella catarrhalis for which antibiotics were titrated accordingly.
He was also noted to have a lower extremity cellulitis and started on warm compresses.
