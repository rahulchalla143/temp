Approximately 2 hours following the procedure she developed sudden onset right sided weakness and numbness.
Neuro exam was pertinent for right sided numbness, weakness and right hemianopsia.
CTA did not seem to show a definite clot in left main stem MCA but on coronal section decreased flow in M3 and M4 on left side.
CTP showed a possible area of decreased blood volume in the left MCA.
Within the first hour of receiving tPA she began to have increased movement in her right arm and right foot.
Right hemianopsia persisted.
She was last cardioverted in [**Month (only) 1096**] while on Sotalol 80 [**Hospital1 **] and reverted back to atrial fibrillation within minutes of getting shocked.
She reports a rapid heart beat and shortness of breath with exertion.
In addition, a TEE performed just prior to her procedure showed no evidence of left atrial clot.
She also received therapeutic IV heparin throughout the period of left atrial access during her atrial fibrillation ablation procedure.
On review of symptoms, she reports post procedural substernal discomfort without radiation; chronic lower back pain; diffuse achy belly pain.
Of note she has a long standing history of low back pain and history of irritable bowel syndrome.
She has no prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
She does have frequent "shooting" chest pain which comes and goes and is not related to exertion.
She also notes dyspnea on minimal exertion, especially with climbing stairs.
She currently has no chest pain or shortness of breath.
She denies any current paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or presyncope.
Please note pt was admitted in [**Month (only) 321**] for the cardiac compaints and was rule dout for MI and had cath with clean coronaries.
Chronic renal insufficiency.
Peptic ulcer disease.
Pulmonary hypertension.
No evidence for coronary artery disease by cardiac cath on disease on [**2123-10-22**] 9.
Chronic low back pain and left hip pain s/p hip replacement 11.
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, previously on coumadin 12.
Right shoulder pain, s/p surgery [**28**].
Sclera anicteric.
Conjunctiva were pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Supple with no JVD.
Chest: Reproducible tenderness on anterior chest wall.
No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Abd: Obese, soft, NTND, No HSM.
Mild diffuse tenderness to deep palpation.
Access sites in left and right groin with no swelling, redness or tenderness.
No hematoma appreciated.
1+ pulses in bilateral lower extremities.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses: Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit .
Left arm and leg with normal strength.
Sensory intact to light touch, pinprick, joint position sense, vibration throughout the left side; she has decreased light touch throughout the right side more pronounced in the right lower extremity.
Cranial nerves: Extraocular movements intact, no nystagmus.
Right hemianopsia, left sided visual fields intact.
Pertinent Results: CT brain perfusion [**2-8**]  HEAD CT: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or infarction.
There is no fracture.
There is mild atherosclerotic plaque in the bilateral carotid artery bifurcations, but the distal cervical internal carotid arteries are normal according to NASCET criteria bilaterally.
There is no evidence of aneurysm formation or other vascular abnormality.
CT PERFUSION: The perfusion map appear normal, with no evidence of delayed transit time, reduced blood flow or blood volume.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the right atrial appendage.
No thrombus is seen in the right atrial appendage No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No intracardiac thrombus seen.
Mild spontaneous biatrial echo contrast.
MRI [**2-9**]  ROUTINE MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT GADOLINIUM.
On the diffusion-weighted images, there are three punctate foci of slow diffusion, two in the left motor cortex and one in the right parietal subcortical white matter.
MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates patency of the anterior and posterior circulations.
There is no aneurysm or stenosis within limits of this examination.
There is no hydrocephalus.
IMPRESSION:  Three tiny punctate, probably embolic acute infarctions as described above, without associated mass effect or edema  Brief Hospital Course: # CVA  Patient with several vascular risk factors, postop from pulmonary vein isolation, who had sudden onset right-sided numbness/weakness.
Her neurologic exam was significant for right sided numbness and fluctuating weakness, as well as right hemianopsia, most concerning for L MCA stroke.
CTA did not seem to show a definite clot in left main stem MCA but on coronal section decreased flow in M3 and M4 on left side.
CTP showrd a possible area of decreased blood volume in the left MCA She was within the three hour window for IV tPA and given the findings on CTA/P and her neurologic exam, she was given 9 mg iv STAT and then 81 mg infusion in one hour.
TEE showed no evidence for thrombus in atria.
MRI on [**2-9**] showed three tiny punctate, probably embolic acute infarctions without associated mass effect or edema.
Patient's weakness and strength improved significantly throughout hospitalization.
Prior to discharge, she had full strength and sensation in her arm and leg and only a mild residual visual field deficit.
# Atrial fibrillation  Refractory to multiple medications and cardioversions.
s/p PVI for atrial fibrillation which did not keep patient in SR. She developed atrial fibrillation three times throughout hospitalization requiring several doses of IV metroprolol and diltiazem.
# HTN  Stable on regimen of diltiazem, lisinopril and furosemide.
# DM II  Discharged on home glipizide dose.
