Admission Date:  [**2189-8-8**]              Discharge Date:   [**2189-8-12**]  Date of Birth:  [**2149-3-12**]             Sex:   M  Service: CARDIOTHORACIC  Allergies: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs  Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**] Chief Complaint: Mild fatigue and leg swelling  Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: [**8-10**] Redo AVR/TVR (23mm [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Regent Mechanical Aortic Valve, 25mm On-X mechanical tricuspid valve) & replacement of permenant A&V leads & generator   History of Present Illness: 40 yo M with rheumatic heart disease s/p MVR/TVR in [**2171**].
Presenting following cath and recent echo which showed  4+ AI, moderate mechanical valve MS and mild TR.
Past Medical History: -s/p mitral valve replacement with a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] bileaflet prosthesis, tricuspid valve replacement with a porcine bioprosthesis in [**2172**] -Moderate-to-severe aortic regurgitation -Hx rheumatic fever -Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 -Atrial fibrillation -Elevated cholesterol -HTN   Social History: Significant for the absence of current or former tobacco use.
Family History: There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
FINDINGS: There is an enormous area of low density, essentially within the entire left middle cerebral artery territory, including the left lentiform nucleus and internal capsule.
There is complete effacement of the cerebral sulci and moderate mass effect exerted upon the left lateral ventricle, with a few millimeters right-sided subfalcine herniation.
There is also probable mild left-sided uncal and hippocampal herniation.
There is no definite accompanying hemorrhagic content within the infarct at this time.
There is no hydrocephalus.
There is moderate mucosal thickening within the ethmoid sinuses and to a milder degree within the maxillary sinuses, either related to intubation or an accompanying inflammatory disorder.
CONCLUSION: Acute left middle cerebral artery territory infarction involving both the superior and inferior divisions.
No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Severely dilated LV cavity.
Mildly depressed LVEF.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
Mild valvular MS (MVA 1.5-2.0cm2).
Trivial MR.  TRICUSPID VALVE: Bioprosthetic tricuspid valve (TVR).
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2).
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe tricuspid stenosis is present.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
However subsequently reasonable short axis views obtained.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report  CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE  [**2189-8-11**] 3:29 PM  CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE  Reason: assess for stenosis  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 40 year old man s/p avr/tvr c/b cva REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: assess for stenosis CAROTID STUDY  HISTORY: Stroke after valve replacement.
FINDINGS: There is no appreciable plaque or wall thickening involving either carotid system.
There is slight elevation of the left ECA peak velocity to 231 cm/s indicating an approximately 60% stenosis of this vessel.
Waveforms on the left demonstrate externalization of the common carotid waveform as well as absent antegrade flow during diastole involving the left internal carotid arteries.
These findings are strongly suspicious for a high-grade stenosis or occlusion on the left, distal to the area of interrogation (more central).
No evidence of stenoses involving the cervical carotid systems.
Indirect findings strongly suspicious for high-grade stenosis or occlusion of more central left vasculature, i.e., intracranial left ICA.
His sedation was then weaned and he was found to have right hemiplegia and to not follow commands.
CT brain showed large left MCA infarct, hyperdense left MCA sign present, mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle, several mm of subfalcine herniation to the right and mild uncal and hippocampal herniation, and no bleed or atrophy.
Carotid ultrasound showed no significant stenosis, but no end diastolic flow in the left CCA&ICA.
He was seen by neurosurgery who felt that the injury would likely result in a vegetative state.
