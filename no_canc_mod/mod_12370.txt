[**2179-2-8**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]   History of Present Illness: 82 yo female with history of cellulitis, CAD, diabetes who recently presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital [**2178-1-19**] with right and left sided tingling x 1-1.5hr.
Carotid US demonstrated critical 80-99% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
She reports having difficulty walking due to persistence of LE weakness and spends most of her time in a wheelchair.
ROS: (+) LE swelling unchanged, R LE weakness, tingling sensation (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied cough, shortness of breath.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.
No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
PAD with recently documented TIA with the carotid duplex suggesting the critical left ICA lesion.
Also with AMI [**2174**] with instent restenosis in LCx, s/p restenting and brachytherapy.
Also with residual 70% ostial stenosis of LAD, 70% mid vessel stenosis of the LAD with an 80% mid vessel stenosis of the D1, medically managed.
Poor mobility due to multiple factors.
Recurrent urinary tract infections due to chronic catheterization.
Chronic leg cellulitis/bilateral.
Bilateral pedal edema - multifactorial.
Bipolar disease 10.
COPD 11.
Physical Exam: Vitals: T: 98.0 P: 70 BP: 154/61 R: SaO2:99% on RA General: Obese talkative elderly female in no acute distress HEENT: PERRL, cataracts, non elevated JVP.
S1S2, no M/R/G noted Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Obese Extremities: 2+ edema to knee.
Radiologic Data: [**2179-1-19**] Carotid U/S: Grossly abnormal study: On the left side there is soft heterogeneous plaque which is irregular.
It is present in the carotid bulb and extends into the proximal left internal carotid artery.
Spectrum analysis shows markely accelerated flow velocities and spectral broadening consistent with an 80-99% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
On the right side there is heterogeneous calcific plaque in the bulb which involves the right internal carotid artery.
Spectrum analysis is wnl, not suggesting any evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis present in the right internal carotid artery.
Conclusion: Grossly abnormal study 1) Evidence of critical 80-99% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
2) No evidence of hemodynamically significant stenosis present in the right internal carotid artery.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 82 year old female with severe carotid stenosis and hx of recent TIA, suggesting [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3098**] lesion, who had a stent placed in the [**Doctor First Name 3098**] with uncontrolled hypertension.
Pt denies symptoms of orthopnea, chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope and no amaurosis fugax.
She was prehydrated with bicarb and given periprocedural n-acetylcysteine for renal protection.
She was notably hypertensive pre and post procedure requiring nitroprusside gtt with goal SBP 100-150 for adequate cerebral perfussion.
She had reported a headache/neck pain immeadiately following the procedure but those resolved and the decrease hct was thought to be dilutional.
She had no hypotension or tachycardia.
Likely due to diabetic nephropathy.
She received hydration with bicarb and mucomyst for renal protection.
