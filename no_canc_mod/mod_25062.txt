History of Present Illness: 66 year old male who developed chest pain yesterday with radiation down left arm.
CT at outside hospital revealed Type A aortic dissection.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
A mobile density is seen in the aortic arch consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post bypass  Very poor image quality.
Biventricular systolic function unchanged.
Small portion of the dissection flap still seen in the distal arch.
Mild aortic insufficiency present.
[**Location (un) 11916**] type A acute aortic syndrome.
There is intramural hematoma eccentrically affecting the lateral aspect of the ascending aorta with a focal defect demonstrating contrast abutting pre-existing hematoma.
This suggests a pre-existing intramural hematoma progressing to dissection, which likely precipitated the acute presentation.
There is no extension of dissection into the coronary arteries or the origins of the great vessels.
Left complex renal mass which requires further workup following treatment for the aortic dissection.
Renal cell carcinoma cannot be excluded.
