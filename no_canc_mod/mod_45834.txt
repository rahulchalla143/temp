In brief, the patient is a 60-year-old gentleman who has had a long complicated hospital course, which has been fully detailed in a prior discharge summary.
In brief, he has a history of Crohn's disease originally.
He is from [**Location (un) 8679**], who has been in the hospital being treated for complications resulting from an enterocutaneous fistula.
At the start of this segment of his hospital course, the patient has been in Intensive Care Unit on a ventilator undergoing therapy for respiratory infection for fungemia and bacteremia.
This was performed for a persistent right pleural effusion and persistent pneumonia, which was refractory to therapy.
He received both parenteral and antral nutrition and remained on antibiotics, including Vancomycin and meropenum for pseudomonas and enterococcal positive cultures from the sputum and urine, respectively.
The thoracic team subsequently began a chemical pleurodesis at the bedside over the course of 3 days to help reduce pleural fluid drainage.
During the next days of his recovery, he was diuresed, after the VAT pleurodesis remained approximately 8 kg above his dry weight, and this was diuresed gently over the next several days and weeks.
On [**8-5**], a routine blood culture that had been sent demonstrated gram negatives.
There was a component of it, which appeared to be due to anxiety when he would go on to trach mask trials.
An echocardiogram was performed, which demonstrated a global hypokinesis and an EF of 25-30%, which had actually decreased from a previous echocardiogram, which was 45%.
He was ruled out for myocardial infarction and cardiology was called.
They felt at this time, this may be an overall indication of his stress from his severe illness.
On [**2136-8-21**], the patient spiked a temperature to 100.9 with accompanied tachycardia and hypotension.
A chest x-ray showed an accumulation of right pleural effusion, and this was tapped via percutaneous pigtail catheter in the radiology lab.
He was treated with a full course of caspofungin, continued on meropenum, and he had empiric Vancomycin, but there was no gram positive cultures, and this was discontinued after several days.
He has been out of bed, at the edge of the bed, though he is yet to have weight beared fully, as he is severely deconditioned.
At this point, the best course of action would be for him to continue with a ventilatory wean, perhaps at a facility which would better suit his chronic respiratory failure and who would be able to better situate him.
