States that becomes SOB after 600 yrds walking or with walking up any incline.
Admitted last month after 1 wk of CP--> stress test showed large reversible defect.
He was then admitted for cath which showed diffuse disease with patent LIMA and occluded SVG-PDA.
Since that admission, the patient had ongoingdyspnea and has been worked up for dyspnea by CT scans x2 at NEBH which showed pleural plaques and LLL mass vs. rounded atelectasis.
Also had low prob V/Q scan.
Pt states that he has been more short of breath over the last 1 month.
DOE has progressed and is now with minimal exertion.

Now presents after galloping progression of DOE with associated cough, profound wheeze, and hypoxia w/ exertion.
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ________________________________________________________________ ## From a Respiratory Standpoint:    - Probable Asthma    - Restrictive Lung Disease (Pleural Asbestos-related Plaques)    - LLL mass  Pulmonary consultation was sought on admission.
Clinical presention was most notable for bronchospastic disease.
Probable asthma w/ a contribution from restrictive lung disease was likely mediating his progressive dyspnea.
This is the likely diagnosis when taken in concert with his 2 Chest CT scans that did NOT show parenchymal changes consistent with interstitial disease.
During the PFTs, there was still a component of bronchospasm given wheeze/response to steroids.
Bronchodilator challenge showed FVC improvement though not diagnostic of asthma as this study was done on 10mg of Prednisone.
Patient was also treated empirically for atypical PNA vs AECB with Levoquin.
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ________________________________________________________________ ## Rapid AFlutter ## RP bleed (on heparin) ## Blood Loss Anemia  [**Hospital **] hospital course was complicated by rapid atrial flutter likely exacerbated by beta agonism from nebulizers.
Prior to the procedure, the patient experienced significant abdominal/pelvic pain with coincidal hypotension, hypothermia, and a 7 point hemotocrit drop.
The integrity of his known AAA (s/p repair) was assess by Vascular surgical consultants who felt there was no acute surgical intervention necessary for either the RP bleed or the stable appearing AAA (not felt to be source of bleed).
Cardiac Surgery felt the ascending aortic aneurysm was stable as compared with previous scans (likely old organized extra-thoracic fluid from prior AVR/CABG in [**6-19**]) and not active at this time.
Patient was volume rescusitated in the MICU receiving 5 Units PRBC and 8 Liters Normal Saline.
Given mild muscle stranding noted on CT, the ICU team empirically treated for potential bacterial superinfection along a hemotoma site w/ Vancomycin.
Culture data eventually returned no growth, patient remained afebrile, and antibiotics were d/c'd after 7 days noting as well that sepsis was unlikely a contributor to the decompensation.

Focal outpouching unchanged.

This was likely due to asthma and some restrictive lung disease.
Please use 2 liters of oxygen via the nasal canula with any moderate exertion (for example ascending stairs) or at any point you are feeling short of breath.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] wanted you to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4134**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3647**] who is a pulmonologist.
Please call your doctor or go to the ER if you develop: * any signs of bleeding * uncontrolled shortness of breath * chest pain * dizziness * any worrisome symptoms  Followup Instructions: DR.
