Patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2106-10-3**] with right-sided rib pain, nausea, vomiting (x 1 day) and loose stools (4-5 per day x 1 month, non-bloody).
He was found to have a total bilirubin of 1.9, ast 71 and alt of 76; also with elevated white blood cell count of 18.6.
Patient had an abdominal CT scan on admission which showed fluid in the colon consistent with enteritis vs colitis.
Stool was negative for C.difficile.
GI (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted, reviewed the CT scan with radiology - stable dilation of the CBD compared to [**2102**] and [**2101**] with dilation all the way to the ampulla and no intraluminal abnormality/stone seen; also with stable segmental intrahepatic dilation that appears to be related to previous liver surgery.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was concerned for biliary obstruction however patient unable to have MRCP due to pacemaker.
Regarding patient's right-sided rib pain - described as constant, starts under right axilla and radiates to right shoulder and right upper quadrant, worse with inspiration.
No recent falls.
An x-ray was done at [**Hospital3 3583**] which showed healing fractures of the right 8th and 9th ribs (patient had presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2106-7-26**] after falling out of a broken chair and elbow pushing into right chest wall - pa/lat cxr at the time did not reveal any rib fractures; rib pain had resided two weeks ago).
Given patient's significant cardiac history he was monitored on telemetry at [**Hospital3 3583**] without any significant events and ruled out for AMI with 4 sets of negative troponins.
CTA of chest was done which was negative for pulmonary embolism (had a positive d-dimer).
Currently patient continues to have right-sided rib pain with inspiration that is [**10-4**] at maximum.
Denies any chest pain or sob.
Endorses several episodes of palpitations over the past week.
Currently denies any abdominal pain.

Brief Hospital Course: 57 year old male with pmhx significant for CAD s/p CABG and LAD stent, porcine tricuspid valve, complete heart block s/p pacemaker, hypertension, GERD, biliary stricture s/p CCY and MVA [**2071**] s/p multiple abdominal surgeries including partial liver resection who was transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] with nausea, vomiting and diarrhea from likely infectious colitis.
Hospital course was complicated by the development of symptomatic atrial fibrillation/ atrial flutter requiring TEE cardioversion.
1. presumed colitis: Patient transferred from OSH with nausea/ vomiting/ diarrhea from likely infectious colitis.
CT scan at OSH was compatible with diagnosis of acute colitis vs enteritis, although patient's complaint of diarrhea appears to be more chronic and may warrant further outpatient evaluation.
2. atrial fibrillation/ atrial flutter: complained of symptomatic palpitations with dyspnea x 1 month prior to admission.
Etiology of arrhythmia was unclear: CTA negative for PE at OSH, TSH within normal limitis, ruled out for cardiac ischemia although echo showed biventricular dysfunction.
Pacer was readjusted with immediate releif of symptoms of palpitations and 'impending sense of doom.'
He was able to ambulate around the ICU with stable heart rate and no significant symptoms.
He was discharged home with increased metoprolol dose of 75mg [**Hospital1 **], dabigatran [**Hospital1 **] and was placed on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of hearts monitor x 2 weeks to assess for significant remaining arrhythmias.
R.sided rib pain: osh film with healing 8th and 9th rib fractures - no new trauma, ?
healing from injury in [**2106-7-26**] and if so unclear why pain improved and is now worsening; PE ruled out by negative CTA; no evidence of PNA; ROMI negative at OSH and at [**Hospital1 18**], making ischemia unlikely.
Pain was managed conservatively with demerol and lidocaine patch prn with resolution of symptoms through hospital course.
Leukocytosis: likely due to infectious colitis as further infectious evaluation negative including blood, urine and stool cultures.
CAD/HTN:  As above, no signs of active ischemia per EKG and serial cardiac enzymes.
Anxiety: patient complained of significant anxiety relating to palpitations through hospital course which was managed by ativan prn.
Transitions of care: # afib/ flutter s/p d/c cardioversion: - KOH monitor x 2 weeks - dabigatran [**Hospital1 **] for anticoagulation until cardiology follow up - bblocker uptitration - follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]  # colitis: - complete antibiotic course - f/u cdiff pcr  Medications on Admission: Outpatient medications (per osh admission h and p): plavix 75mg daily ativan 1mg po prn metoprolol xl 50mg daily zantac 150mg [**Hospital1 **] crestor 40mg daily .
2. lorazepam 1 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day as needed for anxiety.
Disp:*60 Capsule(s)* Refills:*1* 10. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every eight (8) hours as needed for pain for 7 days.
