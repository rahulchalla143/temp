Right cadaveric renal transplant in [**2163**] for hypoplastic kidney.
ALLERGIES:  There were no known allergies.
[**Name (NI) **] was intubated by the EMTs and was transferred to [**Hospital **] Hospital with hypotension and oliguria.
The patient continued to have poor urine output and was subsequently changed to phenylephrine infusion.
The patient had a known baseline BUN and creatinine of 41 and 2.2 in [**2174-5-27**].
He was also noted to have some diarrhea with guaiac positive stools.
There was some note of some coffee grounds from his nasogastric tube, which cleared with lavage.
The patient also had some elevated liver function tests and CPKs.
On chest x-ray, the patient was noted to have right upper lobe and right lower lobe opacities.
A repeat CT scan of his abdomen was done following Quinton catheter insertion and an unexplained hematocrit drop.
He was treated with one unit of fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K on [**2174-8-8**] for coagulopathy of unknown etiology.
His chest x-ray showed some improvement of his right sided opacities on that date.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of the [**Hospital 228**] transfer to the medical floor, the patient was in no apparent distress and he was afebrile.
He had a II/VI holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border radiating to his left second intercostal space.
He did not have any peripheral edema and his peripheral pulses were palpable.
The abdominal examination revealed bowel sounds that were present and a soft, slightly distended and nontender abdomen.
On [**2174-8-11**], his BUN and creatinine remained unchanged despite receiving no dialysis.
An ultrasound of his renal transplant was done and that showed that his transplant to be without abnormality.
A hemolysis screen was done to rule out the possibility of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, given his low hematocrit and low platelet count.
This screen was normal and a peripheral smear demonstrated no schistocytes.
He was noted to have an increasing white blood cell count from 12,000 to 14,000 with no focus.
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Acute renal failure, likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis from an episode of hypotension that was likely precipitated by dehydration from diarrhea.
