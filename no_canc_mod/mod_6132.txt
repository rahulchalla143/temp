Severe emphysematous changes of the lungs and interstitial changes in the periphery of the bases.
New tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in the lower lobes could represent an acute infectious process in the bases versus aspiration * MRI C-spine: ) No evidence of epidural abscess.
*  Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 45 yo with end stage pulmonary disease secondary to emphysema and asthma here with COPD exacerbation and prolonged respiratory failure.
* 1) Respiratory Failure: secondary to COPD exacerbation with poor FEV1(0.23) at baseline from PFTs [**1-17**] and was on transplant list but taken off for continued smoking.
Unclear trigger of exacerbating event, but on arrival was febrile to 101.
Her DFA for influenza was negative and sputum was minimal with sputum cultures growing only oropharyngeal flora.
She was intubated [**2150-4-10**] for increased respiratory distress and remained on ventilator with slow wean despite steroids and bronchodilators.
Given prolonged ventilator wean,  patient had trach and PEG placed by CT surgery [**2150-4-17**].
2) Steroid myopathy: after weaning of sedation, patient initially noted to be weak.
Her C-spine was negative for epidural abscess, but noted to have a T-5 fracture- that is assymptomatic and will just be followed.
Neurology was consulted and the patient had an EMG [**4-27**] that was consistent with axonal polyneuropathy.
3) Sinusitis: after 2weeks into her stay after intubation, patient developed fevers and had a positive head CT for sinusitis and was treated empirically with 10 days of Vancomycin and ceftaz; she will complete her course on [**2150-5-2**].
At time of discharge, she remained afebrile with wbc 12.5 (trending down).
* 4) Fluid overload: Following admission, the patient was aggressively hydrated given low urine output with good response.
Over the course of her stay, however, she was noted to have a positive fluid balance with increased lower extremity edema.
Her volume state (including daily weights) will need to be monitored following discharge and her furosemide dose adjusted as needed for clinical euvolemia.
* 5) Esophageal candidiasis: During PEG placement on [**2150-4-17**], she was noted to have evidence of esophageal candidiasis and was treated with a 7 day course of fluconazole.
* 6) Cephalic vein clot: On [**2150-4-15**], the patient was noted to have increased right upper extremeity edema.
A right upper extremity ultrasound confirmed an occlusive thrombus in the right cephalic vein.
She completed a 7 day course of heparin for a superficial clot.
* 8) Anxiety: The patient's chronic anxiety was a major management issue during this hospitalization.
She had multiple episodes of severe anxiety with associated tachypnea (respiratory rate in the 30s) and tachycardia (HR 120s-140s) requiring IV ativan/haldol.
* 9) Ileus: secondary to excessive narcotics regemin and resolved with aggressive bowel regemin.
