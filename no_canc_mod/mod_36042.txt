On return to his NH, he was noted to look feverish and have altered mental status.
He was diaphoretic and was rigoring.
He was noted to have frank pus expressed from his foley catheter prior to obtaining UA and cx.
He went for a CT a/p with contrast which did not show a source of infection (showed fecal impaction, cholelithiasis w/o cholecystitis, and degenerative disease of his hip).
He had a bedside cardiac U/S performed which did not show any appreciable pericardial effusion.

There is no evidence of dissection.
Coronary vascular calcifications are seen.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism is identified.
There is no pericardial effusion.
CT CHEST BEFORE AND AFTER IV CONTRAST: There is a small right thyroid lobe nodule.
Dependent low density material in the trachea probably represents retained secretions.
There is atelectasis in the right lower lung in the posterior aspect.
Atelectasis is also seen in the posterior aspect of the left lower lung.
No pleural effusions are seen.
Limited views of the abdomen are notable for markedly arthrosclerotic splenic artery.
There is a small hiatal hernia.
The gallbladder is markedly enlarged, and filled with high- density material, consistent in appearance with the large sludge-filled gallbladder seen on ultrasound of the same day.
Bone windows show diffuse demineralization; however, there are no lytic or sclerotic lesions.
There is an S-shaped scoliosis.
There are marked degenerative changes of the spine, with loss of disc height at all levels.
There is right glenohumeral joint DJD and healing fractures of several ribs.
No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
Large dilated gallbladder filled with high-density material consistent in appearance with the ultrasound examination of the same day.
Marked degenerative changes of the spine and an S-shaped scoliosis.
5mm left upper lobe lung nodule; in the absence of known malignancy, noncontrast chest CT can be obtained in 12 months to ensure stability.
Right thyroid lobe nodule can be correlated with thyroid ultrasound if clinically warranted.
Dependent low density material in trachea is probably secretions, but attention to this area on future imaging is advised.
RUQ ultrasound: [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 73 year old man adm with sepsis, with abdominal pain, with gallstones on abd CT REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: pls evaluate for cholecystitis.
INDICATION: 73-year-old man with sepsis and abdominal pain with gallstones noted on recent abdominal CT.
No focal liver lesions or biliary ductal dilatation is identified.
The gallbladder is mildly distended and contains multiple echogenic stones.
Additionally, there is a large echogenic filling defect along the nondependent portion of the gallbladder, which does not appear to contain color flow.
This may represent tumefactive sludge or hemorrhage, although mass cannot be excluded.
There is no gallbladder wall edema, pericholecystic fluid, or son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign to suggest cholecystitis.
Within the visualized right kidney is a 2.1 x 2.2 cm rounded anechoic focus consistent with a simple renal cyst.
Cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis.
Additional finding of a large echogenic filling defect adherent to the gallbladder wall along the nondependent wall of the gallbladder may represent tumefactive sludge or hemorrhage; however, neoplasm cannot be excluded.
2.2 cm right simple renal cyst .
intraabdominal pathology?
divertic Field of view: 50 Contrast: OPTIRAY  [**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 73 year old man with hypotension REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: RP bleed?
intraabdominal pathology?
TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced axial CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis with multiplanar reformations was reviewed.
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: There is dependent bibasilar atelectasis.
Visualized heart is remarkable for mitral annular calcifications.
Evaluation of the upper abdomen is limited secondary to arm overlying the abdomen.
No focal lesions are identified in the liver.
The gallbladder is moderately distended with sludge and multiple stones.
There is no pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder wall edema.
There are multiple hypodensities in the spleen that are not fully characterized.
Splenic artery calcifications are noted.
One 1.5cm lesion in the lower pole of the right kidney measures 24HU, perhaps a dense cyst but not fully characterized.
There is no free air or free fluid in the abdomen.
No pathologic adenopathy is identified.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is marked fecal impaction with the rectum distended with stool measuring 15 x 13 cm in axial cross section.
BONE WINDOWS: There is significant diffuse osteopenia.
There is severe degenerative change in the right hip with heterotopic bone formation, and post traumatic deformity with of the right proximal femur.
No fluid collections in the right hip are identified.
The osseous structures are also remarkable for marked rotatory shaped scoliosis with dextroscoliosis and lumbar levoscoliosis.
Significant degenerative changes are present in the spine.
No suspicious lesions are identified.
A distended gallbladder with cholelithiasis, but no definite evidence for cholecystitis.
Chronic osseous changes as described above.

Shortness of breath.
Hyperdynamic LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification.
No MR.  PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No clear evidence of endocarditis seen     Brief Hospital Course: A/P: 73yo M w/ COPD, HTN, DM, and chronic urinary retention, presents with altered mental status, fever, and hypotension s/p replacement of new foley catheter.
# HYPOTENSION: The patient arrived at the emergency department tachycardic, with a fever and a low blood pressure.
He was presumed to have sepsis from an unknown source.
UTI most likely given recent instrumentation by urology; could also be pneumonia or cholecystitis or gut flora translocation due to distended rectum).
Other causes of tachycardia considered included cardiac related (no prior EKG here, has RBBB), adrenal insufficiency, and hypovolemia.
Blood cultures showed no growth.
Tachycardia: The patient demonstrated asymptomatic tachycardia when transferred from the ICU to the regular floor.
This was thought secondary to withdrawal of betablockade (patient's beta blockers had been held when he came in with low blood pressure).
He was asymptomatic and was discharged on his previous dose of oral betablocker.
Lung nodule: CT of the torso demonstrated a 5mm left upper lobe lung nodule, which could be followed up with a repeat CT in 12 months.
Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital **] Healthcare-[**Location (un) 86**]  Discharge Diagnosis: Primary: Urinary tract infection Sepsis .
Secondary: Diabetes Anemia COPD HTN Bipolar   Discharge Condition: Stable Tolerating PO Ambulating   Discharge Instructions: You were hospitalized with low blood pressure and an infection.
You were placed on antibiotics to treat a presumed urinary tract infection.
Also, if you feel chest pain, have fevers or urinary symptoms, you should call a physician.
There have been no other changes to the medications you were taking before you were admitted.
