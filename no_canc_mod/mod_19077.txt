History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname 40503**] is a 53 year old M with PMH of chronic vent/trach recent admission for VAP, severe COPD, prior L CVA with residual R-sided weakness, seizure disorder, depression and schizophrenia who presents from rehab after being found unresponsive overnight.
He was then found unresponsive again at 7am and brought to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
He was admitted hypotensive and hypoxic and found to have ventilator associated PNA.
Sputum and BAL cultures grew Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas.
He was also noted to have frequent mucus plugging requiring suctioning.
He was also hypotensive with SBPs in the 70s related to sepsis vs. adrenal insufficiency.
Of note he was also followed by psychiatry during his hospitalization for concern of suicidal ideation.
He was noted to have right sided pleural effusion with collapse improved after IR guided thoracentesis.
Labs notable for elevated WBC count to 19.5 with 91% neutrophils.
CXR showed alight proximal migration of right-sided PICC line with tip now terminating within the mid subclavian vein, persistent right middle and lower lobe collapse, increased patchy airspace opacities at the left lung base which could represent pneumonia or aspiration.
He then became diaphopretic with a fixed gaze, minimally responsive BP 188/84 R18, 99 % per report he desatted to the 80s but this was not reported.
No urinary or fecal incontinence or tonic clonic activity noted.
Of note, patient has been on a ventilator since [**Month (only) 359**] for respiratory failure secondary to severe COPD.
He was found to have a RML and RLL collapse and paratracaheal LAD as well as chronic right pleural effusions at that time.

1)Unresponsiveness - Unclear etiology, initially suspicous for infection and he was treated with vancomycin after his PICC was removed and tip culture was positive for coag negative staph.
He had no further episodes of unresponsiveness during this admission.
2)Hypotension - He continued to have intermitent, asymptomatic episodes of hypotension with SBP in the 80's- 90s.
Possible contributing factors include volume depletion, adrenal insufficiency and autonomic insufficiency.
For his adrenal insufficiency he was continued on hydrocortisone but was tapered from 100mg IV q8 to 50mg IV Q8 to chronic dose of 20mg qam and 5mg qpm.
Could also have autonomic instability secondary to diabetes contributing to his hypotensive episodes.
3) Pneumonia - On admission he was still being treated for his recent positive sputum cultures on his previous admission which were positive for pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas.
He had no evidence of new infiltrate on imaging.
4)COPD/chronic vent/trach - he had no acute issues during his admission and he was weaned on his ventillator settings.
5)Right leg pain: His leg pain pain was similar to the chronic pain he has had for years, for which he is on chronic narcotics.
Patient denies any suicidal or homocidal ideation during this admission.
He would likely benefit from further psychiatric care and medication adjustment given his continued depressed mood.
No acute issues during this hospitalization.
His free water flushes were increased as he appeared to become dehydrated and hypotensive on tube feeds alone.
12) PPx: proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcer prophylaxis, SC  heparin for DVT prophylaxis  13) Access:He had a right femoral line during his admission to complete his antibiotic course.
