She saw ophthomology for this without diagnosis.
Her son realized that her symptoms may be due to mysathenia.
Then 1 week ago she felt weak all over and developed dysphagia with solid foods, and reports she hasn't eaten anything (even soup) for the past 1 week.
On Monday, she did get slight improvement in her dysarthria and ptosis after receiving the Mestinon.
She says her symptoms are constant, and do not necessarily get worse as the day progresses.
On ROS, she denies diplopia or SOB.
She denies numbness, blurry vision, or headache.
She has had a nonproductive cough for the past few days, but denies fevers/chills, diarrhea, or pain/burning on urination.

Discharge Lab Data; WBC 7.3 HCT 29.0 Direct Coombs test positive Haptoglobin 68 LDH 291 Fe 196 TIBC 224 Ferritin 614   Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an 83 year old right handed woman with a history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] diagnosed 10 years ago previously on Mestinon who presents with a 1 month history of progressively worsening ptosis, dysarthria, and over the past week dysphagia with both solids and liquids.
CT chest showed no evidence of thymoma.
She completed a 5-day course of IVIG (plasmapheresis was deferred due to her complication of thrombosis in the past).
While this was thought to be partially dilutional, there was concern for hemolysis as her LDH was elevated (291) and haptoglobin had decreased to 68 from 125 and her direct Coombs test was positive.
Given our concern, we would recommend should the patient require further IVIG treatments in the future, her HCT should be watched closely and it should be ensured that anti-A titers of future IVIG batches should be < 1:8.
Mild left ptosis with sustained upgaze over 30 seconds.
