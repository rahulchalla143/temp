End-stage liver disease secondary to alcoholic liver    disease.
Hepatic failure.
PROCEDURES:  Exploratory laparoscopy, resection of ileocolic anastomosis and ileoileostomy and mucous fistula, Living unrelated liver transplantation, liver biopsy.
DETAILS OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 55547**] is a very pleasant female who was transferred from [**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center to our institution secondary to liver failure.
She presented with a lower gastrointestinal bleed and underwent evaluation at [**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center where she was found to have what appeared to be hemangiomas involving the right colon.
She underwent resection of the right colon and primary anastomosis but subsequent to this she developed decompensation of her liver disease with ascites and encephalopathy and jaundice.
She was found to have a leaking ileocolic anastomosis.
This was resected and she underwent mucous fistula creation and ileostomy.
Her postoperative course was complicated by a prolonged marked coagulopathy and continued decompensation of her liver disease.
She was unable to be discharged home due to coagulopathy with an INR of 4 to 5 on a routine basis resulting in spontaneous bleeding and requiring a significant replacement of a blood product factors.
Unfortunately she developed a marked critical illness polyneuropathy resulting in marked muscle wasting and weakness that required her to be reintubated.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 55548**] [**Name (STitle) 55549**] the tracheostomy without difficulty and she continued during the hospital course with excellent liver function but did develop a small bile leak and a biliary stricture.
She underwent a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and two stents were placed in the two bile ducts that were anastomosed from her donor liver and she was found only to have a small leak from the anterior segment.
The PTC's were passed across the anastomosis into the jejunal segment and the leak quieted down.
