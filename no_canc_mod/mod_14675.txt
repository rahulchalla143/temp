Admission Date:  [**2123-5-31**]       Discharge Date:  [**2123-6-11**]   Service:  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85 year old male with the chief complaint of left lower extremity ischemia, who presented with worsening pain times three days in the distal left foot, which has been persistent.
The patient had some intermittent pain the day prior.
The patient had positive tingling and numbness and decreased ability to move the foot and toes.
The patient denies any coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, diabetes mellitus.
The patient had no known peripheral vascular disease.
He gives some history of claudication times one year with left lower extremity pain after walking approximately one quarter of a mile which resolved with rest.
Rheumatoid arthritis.
ALLERGIES:   The patient had no known drug allergies.
He was complaining of pain in the left foot; in no apparent distress.
Extremity examination was significant for a cool and discolored left foot, bilateral ankle edema, left greater than right.
Doppler-able popliteals bilaterally with biphasic signals.
Biphasic signal on the right dorsalis pedis and no signal on the left dorsalis pedis.
Monophasic posterior tibial on the left and a biphasic posterior tibial on the right.
Rectal examination was heme negative; no masses noted.
Emergent angiogram was arranged which revealed on [**2123-5-31**], marked aortoiliac disease with severe stenosis of the proximal left common iliac artery, occluded left superficial femoral artery, which reconstituted above the knee and the popliteal artery on the left which occluded just below the knee joint.
No run off vessels were present proximally, however, there was reconstitution of a very distal left posterior tibial artery which supplied the patent but diffusely diseased plantar branches.
A chest x-ray on [**2123-5-31**], revealed bilateral predominantly lower zone interstitial changes, possibly due to chronic interstitial fibrosis but no acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities identified.
In addition, preoperative Urology consultation was obtained which revealed a distal urethral stricture.
Directly postoperatively, the patient was noted to have no dorsalis pedis signal in the PACU.
The left foot remained cool and mottled with blue toes and a monophasic posterior tibial signal.
A chest x-ray on [**2123-6-7**], was noted to have an opacity in the retrocardiac region suggestive of pneumonia with a persistent bilateral interstitial pattern likely due to congestive heart failure.
On [**2123-6-9**], the patient was taken to the Operating Room again for a thrombectomy and revision of fem-fem Dacron bypass graft and exploration of the left posterior tibial artery.
Postoperatively, the patient required multiple fluid boluses for unstable hemodynamics.
