Mother had a chronic abruption noted at 24 weeks with an ultrasound on [**2116-12-21**], which revealed absent diastolic flow.
The baby also had intrauterine growth retardation with an estimated fetal weight on [**2116-12-21**], of 468 grams.
He was resuscitated with blow by oxygen and was intubated at six minutes of age for moderate respiratory distress.
There was no maternal fever, no maternal antibiotics, and rupture of membranes was at the time of delivery.
His lungs had coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
His heart was regular rate and rhythm without a murmur.
Skin examination revealed minimal bruising and no rash.
He is also being treated with Vitamin A to prevent chronic lung disease.
Cardiovascular:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 58719**] required two saline boluses for hypotension in the immediate neonatal period but has been hemodynamically stable since that time.
He was noted to have a murmur on late day of life two and echocardiogram at that time revealed a moderate patent ductus arteriosus.
No further clinical evidence of a PDA has been noted.
He has also had hypokalemia with a low potassium of 2.9 on day of life one.
Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 58719**] has also suffered from hypoglycemia followed by hyperglycemia.
Late on the night of [**2117-1-7**], Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 58719**] experienced hyperglycemia with blood sugar as high as 350.
LFTs and urine for CMV have also been sent to further evaluate his hepatic status.
Blood cultures were negative at 48 hours and the initial plan had been to discontinue antibiotics, but at that time, he became hyperglycemic and acidotic, so the ampicillin and gentamicin were continued.
The acidosis was likely related to development of patent ductus arteriosus, but the plan is to complete an entire seven day course of antibiotics.
