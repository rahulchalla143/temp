Discharge Instructions: You were admitted to the hospital for a ruptured brain anurysm.
You developed post-op fever and were treated with antibiotics for suspected infection.
These antibiotics were stopped when you developed a rash.
The rash was likely due to ceftriaxone or ceftazidime, both of which are part of a group of medications called cephalosporins.
You should not take cephalosporins for infection in the future.
Your cognitive deficits have improved since the aneurysm bleeding was stopped and your right arm/hand weakness is improving.
You were started on an antiseizure medication (Keppra) due to the bleed and will need to take this until directed to stop by your neurosurgeon.
It was discovered that you developed a DVT in your right leg.
