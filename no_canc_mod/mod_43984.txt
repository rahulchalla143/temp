1) CV --CAD:  hx CABG with recent NSTEMI with Trop peak 37.4 at OSH and recent peak 1.17 TropT.
Continued CHF managment with diuresis and afterload reduction given depressed EF and evidence of fluid overload on CXR.
2)[**Name (NI) 22118**] Pt had a respiratory arrest on [**1-17**] in AM secondary to a severe epistaxis with aspiration in the setting of having been on integrillin and with a supratherapeutic heparin level.
Cr improved to 1.7 which is c/w baseline.
4)DM-continued lantus with RISS (humalog), FS QID, diabetic diet, [**Name (NI) 653**] [**Name (NI) **] MD, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] .
Pt reported recent injury to stump.
No signs of infection .
6)ID- At the OSH, pt was found to have a fever, neutropenia, atypical lymphs, and a bandemia.
She had been given empiric zosyn for the fever and at OSH CXR neg for pna, just CHF.
On the morning after transfer pt has repiratory code from likely aspiration event from epistaxis.
CXR showed new upper lobe inflitrates.
[**2091-1-21**]: fever curve improved with nothing but continued zosyn; fever w/u (BCx, UA/UCx, C. diff) so far unrevealing as to etiology of that fever spike [**2089-1-18**].
UTI (she apparently has chronic UTIs and often is on chronic cipro tx), also had some LGT prior to admit, so maybe she did have a viral syndr.
