There is variation in the precordial lead placement.
There is low limb lead voltage.
Cannot exclude prior inferior wall myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2159-7-27**] no diagnostic interim change.
The right atrium is moderately dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Comminuted fracture of the right femoral head with associated cortical breakthrough and step off of the right acetabulum .
Minimal thickening of bilateral scrotal skin and skin along the medial thighs (corresponding to area of redness clinically; ?
cellulitis) with no focal fluid collections or gas locules to sugggest fourniers/abscess.
CHEST (PA & LAT) [**7-30**]: There is no significant lung nodule in this exam.
cardiac disease presenting with one week history of right hip pain and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for hypotension of uncertain etiology and right hip fracture.
Initially admitted to MICU for stabilization due to his hypotension and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring BiPAP, then transferred to the floor.
ACUTE ISSUES # Shock, undifferentiated Patient presented with hip fracture and hypotension.
Hypovolemic shock may be possibility although no clear history of dehydration, and BP did appear to respond to IVF (currently 5.5 L NS total received on admission) with CVP 15.
Distributive shock from hip fracture or even fat emboli may also explain picture.
Secondary causes of hypotension such as pericardial effusion or systemic condition such as adrenal insufficiency were investigated and ruled out.
# Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure Etiology is likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema during fluid resuscitation and also respiratory compensation for severe metabolic acidosis although did have superimposed respiratory acidosis from likely from tiring out before biPAP.
# Acute renal failure Admission Cr 3.7 (from 4) with K 5.8 HCO3 10 consistent with primary non-gap metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap and superimposed respiratory acidosis.
Renal failure likely pre-renal +/- some element of intrinsic disease +/- drug side effect from numerous NSAIDs on medication list.
No evidence of obstruction on CT Abd.
# Right Hip Avascular Necrosis: Patient received CT Pelvis to evaluate for Fournier's gangrene in setting of scrotal skin changes, was negative for Fournier's, but concerning Right hip changes were noted.
Final read per radiology showed "Right femoral head avascular necrosis with subchondral collapse and subchondral fracture.
Cystic area within the anterior femoral head presumably secondary to subchondral cystic change."
They suggested that given his acute medical instability that the patient follow up as [**Known firstname **] outpatient for operative management.
Until follow up with Ortho, patient is non-weight bearing on the RLE.
#New Onset Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response While in the MICU, the patient had two brief episodes of AFib with RVR; once requiring a dose of IV metoprolol, and once self-converting into sinus rhythm.
During his hospital course on the floor, however, the patient again began to enter a rhythm consistent with AFib, often times with a ventricular rate into the 140s.
His metoprolol was increased gradually, but because of persistent episodes of AFib the decision was made to convert the patient from short acting to Metop XL 100mg [**Hospital1 **].
Given his new diagnosis of AFib and his history of diabetes, CAD and prior CVA, the decision was made to initiate anticoagulation with coumadin.
# Gout - On the day prior to discharge, patient had swelling of his PIP joints in bilateral middle fingers.
# Abdominal pain/scrotum issue Patient's scrotum appears to be without acute infection.
There is no acute abdomen to explain abdominal pain on admission.
At the time od discharge, his abdomen is pain free.
# Normocytic, normocytic Anemia Unknown baseline Hgb.
He had positive gross blood on rectal exam.
There is no evidence of blood loss into hip fracture at this time with neurovascular structures intact.
# Thrombocytopenia Patient has platelets of 89 on admission with normal coags.
Likely from marrow suppresion given acute illness with no stigmata of chronic liver disease.
CHRONIC ISSUES # Diabetes - The patient was maintained on [**Known firstname **] insulin sliding scale during his hospital course.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES The patient will need to follow up with our [**Hospital 9696**] Clinic in order to plan possible operative intervention for his right hip avascular necrosis once he is more medically stable.
Senna 1 TAB PO BID:PRN constipation hold for loose stool 11.
Lisinopril 5 mg PO DAILY   Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: Tower [**Doctor Last Name **]  Discharge Diagnosis: AVN of the Right femoral head Atrial fibrillation Acute kidney injury Hypotension Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure Anemia Thrombocytopenia   Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Activity Status: Out of Bed with assistance to chair or wheelchair.
As you know, you were hospitalized with right hip pain that was complicated by low blood pressure and difficulty breathing.
Your hip pain is the result of a type of fracture known as avascular necrosis.
Our orthopaedic surgeons believe that you should follow up with them as [**Known firstname **] outpatient to plan possible operative fixation in the future once you are doing better from a medical standpoint.
During your hospital stay you developed [**Known firstname **] irregular heart beat known as atrial fibrillation.
Because people who have atrial fibrillation are at a higher risk of developing strokes, we began treating you with a blood thinner known as coumadin, which can help decrease this risk.
