Degenerative changes are noted at the dens on the right side and a small osteoma in the right side of the frontal sinus.
Small hypoechoic round lesion at the dome of the liver, likely a small cyst.
Residual pleural effusion.
Since there is appreciable leftward mediastinal shift this could be collapsed.
A lesser volume of abnormality is present in the infrahilar right lower lobe.
Small bilateral pleural effusions could be present but not appreciated on conventional radiographs.
Mild cardiomegaly is longstanding.
Substantial intestinal distention is noted in the imaged portion of the upper abdomen.

There is mild interval increase in gas distention of small bowel loops.
Consolidation in the middle lobe is slightly worse than on the previous chest radiograph from [**2149-9-9**] and there is new left lower lobe atelectasis.
The remaining lungs are clear with no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
There is progressive distention of the large bowel without no obvious bowel wall thickening.
Very minimal increase in the size of the large right chest wall hematoma as described above.

Diff: Negative -[**2149-11-2**] Urine: No growth -[**2149-11-4**] Blood x 2: ________ -[**2149-11-4**] Urine: No growth  Brief Hospital Course: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 yo man with alcoholic cirrhosis, complicated by ascites, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy, who initialy presented with altered mental status and was admitted to the ICU.
# Altered Mental Status: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy.
A RUQ US was also performed which did not show any acute biliary pathology.
The patient had an acute decline in mental status on the morning of [**2149-10-18**], with physical exam findings suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy, including asterixis.
Additionally, he had received two doses of morphine for pain and appeared oversedated.
He was restarted on lactulose, and then stopped after stabilization of his mental status.
On [**2149-10-30**] the patient again had a change in mental status, this time consistent with delerium and felt to be secondary to underlying infection.
The patient was started on Vanc/CTX [**10-30**] out of concern for possible RUE cellutitis and possible other occult infection.
His mental status was then generally clear for several days, with occasional confusion or disorientation.
With his liver and kidney functioning worsening daily, both encephalopathy and uremia became an etiologic factor in his altered mental status.
The patient's mental status also waxed and waned in the setting of receiving opioid analgesia.
He was eventually started on a morphine drip, scopalomine patch, and atropine sublingual drops, when he developed large amounts of oropharyngeal and nasal secretions.
# Acute Renal Failure: Initially, the patient presented with Cr 1.9 elevated from a baseline value of 0.8.
However, his renal function again began to decline and became unresponsive to fluid challenges.
Initially, it was felt that there was a prerenal component to his ARF, because he had been intermittently NPO for procedures and bowel rest in relation to his ileus.
However, renal function did not improve with several days of albumin administration, and it was felt to be due to hepatorenal syndrome.
Additionally, the differential for renal failure included abdominal compartment syndrome, given the patient's significant ascites and colonic distension.
The patient was not considered a candidate for hemodialysis, given the frequent episodes of bleeding that he had demonstrated with even minor interventions.
It was clearly communicated to the patient and the family members that the patient's kidneys were failing and were likely to continue worsening daily.
# Diarrhea - On transfer from ICU, patient was noted to have dark, watery diarrhea.
On physical exam, concern for obstruction given high-pitched "tinkling" bowel sounds.
Diarrhea was felt to be multifactorial, due to a combination of lactulose and non-obstructing ileus.
The diarrhea remained throughout his hospital stay and was felt to be responsible for a chronic metabolic acidosis.
# Colonic Ileus - Abdomen with tympany to percussion on exam and diarrhea concerning for obstruction.
Out of concern for partial obstruction, flex sigmoidoscopy was performed on [**10-6**]; the bowel was decompressed and reaccumulated air within several hours.
Bowel rest and rectal tube decompression was also attempted, without success.
He was closely monitored with serial abdominal exams and KUBs over several weeks, with no significant change in colonic distention.
Additionally, he continued to have bowel movements.
As his condition became increasingly terminal, he occasionally seemed to indicate abdominal discomfort, and was treated with increasingly aggressive comfort measures.
# Traumatic foley placement: As above, abdominal compartment syndome was considered on the differential for renal failure.
Urology placed a coude catheter, with a plan to leave the foley in place for at least one week to tamponade bleeding.
He occasionally passed clots through his Foley catheter, manipulation of the Foley was kept to a minimum, given the aforementioned bleeding complications.
Large chest wall hematoma with CT suggesting component of rebleed.
Also developed urethra bleed from traumatic foley placement (see above), as well as abdominal wall bleeding from para site which required several brief ICU stays for hemodynamic monitoring.
The patient was guaiac negative and subsequently had a formed brown stool so it is believed that the blood was actually pooled blood from his penis that had collected in his perineum.
The patient subsequently had significant bleeding from his penis that lasted throughout the day and following night.
A subsequent blood transfusion caused low grade temperatures and increased work of breathing, and was stopped early.
# UTI - yeast on urine culture.
U/A from [**10-12**] now grew enterococcus and pt completed 7 day course of ceftriaxone from [**Date range (1) 1195**].
# ESLD: Complicated by ascites and encephalopathy.
Presented with hepatic encephalopathy that improved with lactulose and rifaximin, and then declined again for unclear reasons; progression of liver disease versus infection versus stopping lactulose.
Additionally, the patient underwent several diagnostic paracenteses, which showed no evidence of any infection.
During his hospitalization, he was evaluated for liver transplantation and a decision was made that he was not a candidate of transplantation due to the severity of his coagulopathy.
# Guaiac Positive Stools: Patient with history of Guaiac positive stools during prior hospitalization which was atributed to hemorrhoids.
He had one further episode BRBPR, which was self-limited and felt to be hemorrhoidal in origin.
# Hypokalemia - Likely secondary to diuretics and diarrhea.
Hypokalemia resolved with improvement of diarrhea.
