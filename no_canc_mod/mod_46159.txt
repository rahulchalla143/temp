As her prognosis was grave secondary to fulminant hepatic failure, further aggressive treatments were no longer pursued and withdrawn.
The patient was placed on a morphine drip and remained sedated with a propofol drip on mechanical ventilatory support.
At approximately 11:25 p.m., I was called to see the patient secondary to unresponsiveness.
CAUSE OF DEATH:  Fulminant hepatic failure secondary to acute hepatitis B.
