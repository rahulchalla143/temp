was initially admitted in early [**Month (only) **] to the OSH with abdominal pain and diagnosed with cholecystitis and gallstone pancreatitis.
He reportedly had an NSTEMI during this episode and so was only treated with antibiotics as surgery was too risky.
He was also admitted in [**Month (only) **] w/ GIB and had gastric ulcer clipped.
Most recently, he was watching a red sox game on [**5-21**] when he began having abdominal pain then nausea and vomitting.
He had some blood in his emesis but at OSH his Hct remained stable and his vomiting resolved.
His amylase and lipase were elevated in the 1000 range and his LFTs and Tbili/AP were elevated as well.
He was tachycardic and moderately hypotense to 96/67.
He was planned for MRCP but this was not done given recent ulcer clipping w/ metal clip and he was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP and close monitoring from the ICU at St. [**Hospital 11042**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 8117**], NH.
On presentation to the ICU, he continued to complain of abdominal pain which he says was only improved with dilaudid but returns to the same baseline pain in between doses.

There were few filling defects that appeared like sludge at the lower third of the common bile duct.
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire Sludge, few small stone fragments, and purulent bile in small amount were extracted successfully using a 8.5 mm balloon.
Otherwise, the caliber and course of the the common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right and left hepatic ducts, and intrahepatic bile ducts were normal.

The recommendation of the ERCP team that he be considered for early cholecystectomy was discussed with the PCP by both the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] team and hospitalist, and the PCP prefers to hold off for now given his significant cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities.
#Gallstone pancreatitis s/p ERCP: Pus drained from bile ducts with sphincterotomy and stent placement.
CHF/CAD: Appeared mildly volume overloaded on admission, but given borderline BP in setting known bacteremia home lasix was held and IVF given prn.
He was continued on PO metoprolol for rate control and increased on hospital day #3 due to persistent heart rate in the 130s, likely related to increased activity on transfer to the medical floor (now walking independently, out of bed).
His PCP has been holding coumadin given recent GI bleed but had planned to restart this on [**5-27**], so he was started on 2mg warfarin daily, to be followed by his PCP (discussed with PCP)   Medications on Admission: Home ocuvite 2tabs daily Omeprazole 20mg daily isosorbide dinitrate 20mg [**Hospital1 **] Simvastatin 40mg daily doxazosin 2mg QHS Metoprolol tartrate 25mg [**Hospital1 **] Furosemide 40mg daily spironolactone 25mg Daily nitroquick 0.4mg PRN .
