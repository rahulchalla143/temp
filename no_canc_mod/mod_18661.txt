This required one amnio reduction in twin B due to polyhydramnios on [**2127-12-23**] with 800 cc removed and a karyotype was sent from that sample showing 46XX chromosomes.
(3) Mother was noted to have vaginal bleeding on [**2127-12-25**] and was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] overnight for bedrest.
(5) Noted to have significant vaginal bleeding on the day of delivery and the decision was made to deliver in the setting of advanced cervical changes and concern about abruption.
The rest of review of systems was non contributory except for past medical history for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4516**] disease and evaluation of repeated negatives.
There was no maternal fever.
Rupture of membranes occurred at delivery.
This infant emerged by Cesarean section at 8:52 a.m. on [**2128-1-22**] with some respiratory effort.
Anterior fontanel open, slightly full, sutures palpable, normal S1 and S2, no murmur appreciated.
She was also treated with vitamin A to help decrease severity of chronic lung disease.
She remained on mechanical ventilation with increasing and decreasing settings over the next couple of weeks.
Due to increasing respiratory support, IV steroids were initiated and a 10 day course was given starting on [**2128-2-6**], ending on [**2128-2-16**].
Then as infant progressed closer to discharge, need for oxygen remains.
The infant has had no spontaneous apnea/bradycardia at rest since [**2128-5-9**].
She will be discharged to home on the nasal cannula oxygen as previously mentioned, along with Lasix 3 times a day Monday, Wednesday and Friday to support chronic lung disease.
Cardiovascular: The infant presented with symptoms of PDA on newborn day and was treated.
She actually had an echocardiogram done that day which showed a moderate to large PDA.
Another echocardiogram was done on [**2128-2-6**] which showed no PDA but again, the PFO was present.
Follow-up echocardiogram was done to rule out pulmonary hypertension on [**2128-4-22**] as recommended by pulmonology.
At that time, there was mild tricuspid regurgitation.
There have been no further echocardiograms.
At the time of discharge, the infant does continue to have a murmur which is PPS and benign, normal heart rates and blood pressures.
The PICC line that was placed was non-central, due to poor IV access.
Due to elevated BUN and creatinines on [**2128-2-4**], creatinine of 2.0 with BUN of 34, renal ultrasound was done.
The renal ultrasound on [**2128-2-5**] and [**2128-2-6**] both showed decreased diastolic flow.
The urine output then became more brisk with decreasing concerns for renal issues with normalizing BUN and creatinine subsequently thereafter.
Gastrointestinal:  The infant developed hyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy.
The infant had neutropenia at birth with a white blood cell count of 4.8, 10 polys and 0 bands.
No meto or myelos at that time.
The preliminary LP was normal but, 2 days later, the LP grew out coag negative staph and the infant was started on gentamycin and Vancomycin at that time which was [**2128-2-1**].
Blood culture was done on [**2128-2-2**] which grew gram positive cocci.
Two days later, that trach aspirate culture grew gram negative rods which was identified as acinobacter.
The infant had increased work of breathing on [**2128-2-28**].
There were no bands.
There are no further infectious disease issues.
On [**2128-1-28**], there was a tiny cyst noted in the left caudal thalamic groove but on [**2128-2-25**], the head ultrasound was found to be normal.
Ophthalmology:  The infant has had numerous ophthalmic exams initiating on [**2128-3-1**] and progressing with the most recent eye exam done on [**2128-5-31**] and that eye exam showed mature eye on the left.
The infant did have some ROP throughout monitoring of ophthalmologic exams which has significantly improved over time.
The most significant eye exam that was done was on [**2128-4-7**] which showed stage 2, zone 2 in both eyes with venous dilatation at that time but that has subsequently resolved without any treatment needed.
There are no active issues at this time except that one of the triplets did die in the newborn period.
Initially, there was an elevated 17OH and the T4 was slightly decreased.
It was felt that these abnormalities were related to prematurity.
Immunizations recommended: Synagis RSV prophylaxis should be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who meet any of the following four criteria:  (1) Born at less than 32 weeks; (2) Born between 32 weeks and 35 weeks with two of the following:  Day care during RSV season, a smoker in the household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or school age siblings; (3) chronic lung disease or (4) hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease.
Before this age, and for the first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-of-home caregivers.
Respiratory distress syndrome, resolved.
Chronic lung disease, ongoing.
Anemia of prematurity, treated with transfusion.
Apnea of prematurity resolved.
Pulmonary hypertension ongoing.
