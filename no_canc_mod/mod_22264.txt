Admission Date:  [**2158-1-10**]       Discharge Date:  [**2158-1-23**]  Date of Birth:   [**2080-4-7**]       Sex:  M  Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year-old gentleman who presented to his primary care physician in early [**Name9 (PRE) 1096**] with new onset fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and lower extremity edema lasting approximately two weeks prior to admission at the [**Hospital1 69**].
The patient was found to be in congestive heart failure and had new onset atrial fibrillation.
The patient denies any chest pain, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, palpitations or lightheadedness.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 1442**] Hospital for a rule out of myocardial infarction.
An echocardiogram done at [**Hospital3 1443**] revealed 3 to 4+ severe eccentric mitral regurgitation with an ejection fraction of 60%.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Diabetes mellitus.
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.
In general, he was an elderly white male in no acute distress.
No masses palpated.
Cardiovascular irregular rhythm, 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur loudest along the left sternal border.
No pedal edema.
Minimal lower extremity edema.
Electrocardiogram done at that time demonstrated 78 beats per minute, patient in atrial fibrillation, probable old inferior infarct changes, lateral T wave changes, nonspecific.
The results of this cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe 4+ mitral regurgitation with a left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 45%, moderate diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis, right dominant coronary artery.
The patient had approximately 30% stenosis of the left circumflex.
Following his cardiac catheterization the patient was referred to Cardiothoracic Surgery Service for repair of his mitral valve.
The patient developed a right groin hematoma.
It was also determined at that time to repair the right femoral pseudoaneurysm at the same time the patient would be in surgery for his mitral valve repair.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications during the case.
The patient remained intubated and was given intravenous Propofol and was placed on neo-synephrine and Dobutamine drips for pressure support.
The patient also experienced several hours of frequent premature ventricular contractions and trigeminy, but his electrolytes were within normal limits and the patient was asymptomatic.
An electrocardiogram was done at that time, which demonstrated a first degree AV block and ST segment depressions in leads 3 and AVR.
The patient was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells for a low hematocrit.
The patient was also tolerating small amounts of liquids and his pain was well controlled on oral pain medications.
The patient was seen by physical therapy on postoperative day number three and was noted to have a slow gait, but he was able to walk approximately 175 feet and was encouraged to ambulate with assistance.
Postoperative day number four the patient continued to do well and was continued on his Coumadin for atrial fibrillation.
The patient's pain was well controlled on oral pain medications and the patient continued to be anticoagulated while on Coumadin.
The patient continued to remain in atrial fibrillation, but with excellent rate control heart rates approximately 70s to 80s and the patient is asymptomatic.
DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient's condition is excellent, pain well controlled on oral pain medication, ambulating independently and tolerating a regular diet without any difficulty.
Status post mitral valve replacement with 31 mm porcine valve.
Diabetes mellitus type 2.
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Status post diverticular bleed.
