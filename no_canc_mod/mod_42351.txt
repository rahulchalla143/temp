There was pain lying flat, so using four pillows at home.
Presenting MIBI with fixed anteroseptal defect and reversible inferior and inferoseptal defect, now admitted to CMI for catheterization.
No symptoms now, also a large right inguinal hematoma.
Coronary artery disease, right coronary artery [**Year (4 digits) **] in [**2179**], [**2179-12-1**] [**Last Name (un) **]/stenting right coronary artery, [**2181-5-16**], 80% right coronary artery and [**Year (4 digits) **] restenosis, status post [**Year (4 digits) **] complicated by thrombosis treated with a [**Last Name (LF) **], [**2182-4-30**] positive angina, positive ETT MIBI, in-[**Year (4 digits) **] restenosis, to [**Hospital6 **], stenosis dilated, Cypher [**Hospital6 **] and metal [**Hospital6 **] placed; 5.
Bilateral carpal tunnel release; 13.
Arthroscopic left knee surgery.
FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died at 71 with coronary artery disease.
Grandfather died at 52 with a history of coronary artery disease.
General:  Obese and pleasant female, in no acute distress.
Neck:  No jugulovenous distension appreciated.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.
Extremities:  Left hand with petechiae, lower extremities with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
LABORATORY DATA:  Diagnostic studies reveal electrocardiogram interpretation, sinus rhythm with left bundle branch block.
Echocardiogram:  [**2183-1-8**], preliminary echocardiogram showed no minimal pericardial effusion, no evidence of tamponade.
Repeat echocardiogram, [**2183-1-10**], no occlusions, limited study, no carotid doppler study performed.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include septal, anterior akinesis.
There was a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs or tamponade.
Left ventriculography revealed an ejection fraction of 46% with mild global hypokinesis.
There was no mitral regurgitation.
Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system.
The neostented gap was seen on the previously placed proximal image stents.
There was 90% restenosis placed on the initially placed mid [**Year (4 digits) **].
There was a 60% restenosis on the distal Cypher [**Year (4 digits) **].
There was minimal disease of the posterior descending artery, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty site.
At the end of the procedure right heart catheterization was performed to rule out tamponade.
The left ventricular end diastolic pressure was elevated about 30 mm of mercury.
Moderate systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction; 3.
The patient at no point throughout the stay showed any indication of pericardial tamponade.
Hematoma - The patient developed a large right inguinal hematoma which remained stable, nontender the remainder of the stay.
There was evidence of a small left groin hematoma as well which did not increase in size.
Unstable angina 2.
Right coronary artery perforation  DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1.
