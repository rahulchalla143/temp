Admission Date:  [**2183-6-6**]     Discharge Date:  [**2183-6-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2124-5-28**]     Sex:  M  Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease (status post inferoposterolateral myocardial infarction in [**2179**]), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who was transferred from [**Hospital3 15175**] to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2183-6-6**] for a cardiac catheterization.
In [**2179**], the patient's cardiac catheterization revealed an occluded right coronary artery and circumflex with moderate-to-diffuse disease along the left anterior descending artery.
The patient currently has presented with increasing shortness of breath which awoke him from sleep; at which time the patient presented to [**Hospital3 15174**] on [**2183-6-3**].
During the presentation, the patient's BNT was elevated to 459, and the patient's Persantine thallium showed an inferolateral defect; at which time the patient was referred to [**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac catheterization.
There was the presence of mild mitral regurgitation and inferobasal and posterior akinesis.
No evidence of chest pain, and shortness of breath was substantially better after treatment with Bumex.
At this time, the patient was evaluated by Cardiothoracic Surgery Service for a coronary artery bypass graft.
Coronary artery disease with myocardial infarction and known 3-vessel disease in [**2179**].
Ventricular tachycardia; status post implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.
The patient was a well-developed and well-nourished male in no apparent distress at the time of discharge.
No evidence of oral ulcers.
No cervical lymphadenopathy noted.
The staples were intact along the sternotomy incision site, and no evidence of erythema or serosanguineous drainage were noted.
No evidence of hernia noted, and no inguinal lymphadenopathy noted.
There was no presence of hepatosplenomegaly.
Lower extremity examination revealed there was no evidence of edema noted in the lower extremities, and the graft site showed no evidence of erythema or serosanguineous drainage.
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient is a 59-year-old male status post inferoposterolateral myocardial infarction in [**2179**] who, upon catheterization at that time, revealed 100% right coronary artery, 100% mid left circumflex, and mild-to-moderate diffuse left anterior descending artery disease.
However, the patient developed acute shortness of breath, elevated BNT, and Persantine thallium demonstrated mixed inferolateral defect with corresponding cardiac catheterization revealing 60% to 70% left main disease, left anterior descending artery with 80% disease, with an ejection fraction in the high 40% range.
Postoperatively, the patient was taken to the Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit for close monitoring and was promptly extubated without difficulty.
By postoperative day two, the patient again required a moderate amount of Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure support, and the patient developed rapid atrial fibrillation to which the patient was initiated on an amiodarone drip.
Given the history of the patient's intermittent atrial fibrillation, the patient was initiated on heparin for anticoagulation, and Coumadin was also administered.
Immediately prior to initiating the full dosing of Lopressor, the patient developed lightheadedness and alerted the staff of feeling weak.
At this time, no further episodes of lightheadedness were noted by the patient and the patient achieved level V physical therapy status without difficulty.
