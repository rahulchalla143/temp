IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
------EKG [**2193-6-17**]: Wide complex tachycardia - mechanism uncertain - consider "slow" atrial flutter/ atrial tachycardia with 2:1 response Intraventricular conduction delay/ left bundle branch block pattern Clinical correlation is suggested Since previous tracing of [**2190-5-13**], sinus rhythm absent and intraventricular conduction delay seen -------RENAL U.S.  [**2193-6-17**] 6:50 AM: The patient is status post right nephrectomy.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, masses or stones.
Brief Hospital Course: Impression: 82 yo F w/DM, htn, cri, R nephrectomy [**1-14**] nephrolithiasis in past, presents in ARF, hyperkalemia, met acidosis, UTI/pyelonephritis w/ urosepsis, and ruled in for acute NSTEMI.
CAD- NSTEMI in setting of hypotension, stress from ARF and infection.
Equivalent to positive stress test, therefore assume coronary disease likely.
Diastolic CHF: Bedside ECHO (done for +trop, volume overload) showed ef >55%, cxr w/mild CHF following fluid resuscitation, thus may have decreased LV compliance [**1-14**] infarct w/diastolic dysfsn.
Once hemodynamically stable, no issues with CHF with Room Air sats high 90s and clear pulmonary exam.
UCx at [**Hospital1 1774**] ultimately grew E. Coli in 10K-100K, senstivities not performed.
Patient straight caths [**Hospital1 **] at home due to neurogenic bladder which is likely source of infection.
Foley d/c'd [**2193-6-19**] and UOP good without dysuria or back pain.
Renal team consulted and initially felt her to have Type I and Type IV RTA given inappropriate wasting of bicarb in urine with metabolic acidosis.
Known hx of iron deficiency, renal insufficiency.
Hyperkalemia: secondary to renal failure.
given kayexelate, bicarb, insulin and glucose on admission in ED and develop iatrogenic hypokalemia.
Enterococcal UTI/Pyelonephritis 3.
Non-ST elevation myocardial infarct 4.
Acute Renal failure (due to infection, pre-renal azotemia) on chronic renal failure 5.
Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure 6.
Metabolic Acidosis from ileo-loop bladder 7.
Diabetes 8.
Anemia secondary to Chronic renal failure 9.
You will need to have a stress test scheduled by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**3-19**] weeks.
Return to ED for fever, chills, pain with urination, chest pain, shortness of breath.
