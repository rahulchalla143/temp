Admission Date:  [**2129-3-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2101-1-17**]  Date of Birth:   [**2067-10-24**]     Sex:  F  Service:  HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 30% presenting with short of breath and fatigue for two days.
She was noted to be in atrial flutter with a heart rate in the 140s and blood pressure 69/42.
Her dose has recently been decreased because of her decreasing weight.
She reports about a [**1-20**] pound weight loss over the past three weeks.
The patient denied any chest pain.
She reports feeling some palpitations yesterday and also reports some bilateral leg pains after walking around her house.
She denied any falls or loss of consciousness.
She denied any blood in her stool, although has noted it to be black.
No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Cool, trace dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
There were 2+ posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.
Lower extremity hyperpigmentation consistent with venostasis.
EKG showed atrial tachycardia at a rate of 145, left bundle branch block, T wave inversion in II, III, and aVF, V4 through V6.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was in atrial tachycardia at a rate of 146.
Her pacer was interrogated and she was found to have one-to-one atrial and ventricular conduction which was felt to be most consistent with atrial tachycardia.
She continued to have black Guaiac-positive stools during most of her hospital stay.
The Gastroenterology Service saw her in the hospital and will either do an upper endoscopy here while she is an inpatient and on heparin or she may have it done at a later time.
GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  She has a history of upper GI arteriovenous malformations.
Likely her GI bleed is in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR and thrombocytopenia, both of which were corrected during her hospital stay and her hematocrit remained stable, although she will likely need follow-up EGD/push enteroscopy if she does not have it during this hospitalization.
THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  The patient's course of thrombocytopenia coincided with initiation of linezolid to treat her Nocardia bacteremia.
After about three to four days, her platelet count recovered from a nadir of about 43, most consistent with bone marrow toxicity from linezolid.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Likely secondary to profound hypotension when she was admitted Her ACE inhibitor was initially held when she came in and her creatinine subsequently improved.
HISTORY OF SEPTIC PULMONARY EMBOLI SECONDARY TO LINE INFECTION:  The patient has had this from a prior admission from [**Month (only) 956**] of this year when blood cultures grew both Nocardia and a gram-negative rod nonfermenter not further identified.
She was initially on Bactrim high dose but did not tolerate this and was changed to minocycline and Ciprofloxacin but the sensitivities subsequently returned and the organism was intermittently sensitive to minocycline so she was changed to linezolid and Cipro for the last three weeks but her linezolid was discontinued during this admission as it has likely caused her thrombocytopenia.
