She had run out of her outpt advair at this time, and the pharmacy could not get it for awhile, so she was not taking it over the past 5 days.

Also on night PTA, had onset of hives on her face and tongue swelling, which she describes as similar to previous allergic rxns to foods, but denies eating any new foods or foods that she knows she has an allergy to.
To self treat her wheezing, cough at home, she states she has been taking increased amounts of her home albuterol inhaler and nebulizer treatment over past couple days to treat asthma and compensate for no advair.
In ED, initially felt asthma exacerbation and was given prednisone 60mg PO x 1, levofloxacin 250mg x 1, along with albuterol + atrovent nebulizer treatments.
CXR negative for pneumonia.
EKG with diffusely flipped t waves, so concern for pericarditis.
However, bedside U/S demonstrated no evidence of pericardial effusion and pt CP free.
Noted to be tremulous and have hyperreflexia on exam, so concern for thyroid storm.
The characteristics include lack of an opening for the anus which must be repaired at birth, abnormal bones of the hands or feet, kidney problems (usually small, poorly formed kidneys), "lop" shaped ears, and mild sensorineural hearing loss.

Pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits without evidence of interstitial edema.
Hilar contours are normal without evidence of hilar adenopathy.
The cardiomediastinal contour is unusual despite absence of gastric distension as present on previous study.
Similar unusual configuration of the cardiomediastinal contour was also noted on [**2137-8-21**] and has since been unchanged.
There is no evidence of cardiomegaly.
IMPRESSION: Unusual cardiac contour unchanged since [**2137-8-21**].
No pneumonia or acute cardiopulmonary process.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
No aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function.
Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
Lower lobe and lingular subsegmental atelectasis, without evidence of pulmonary embolus.
Brief Hospital Course: Assessment/Plan:  Pt is a 31 yo woman w/ h/o asthma, recently dx MS who p/w asthma exacerbation, fevers, tachycardia w/ initial concern for thyroid storm, but TFTs nl.
# Hypoxia/resp status:  Pt presented w/ c/o "asthma exacerbation" w/ noted wheezing on initial exam.
However, after o/n treatment w/ nebulizer treatments and steroids, pt with increased vs decreased O2 requirement.
CTA chest was done to r/o PE (even though d dimer < 500), neg for PE or parenchymal consolidation.
DFA done on [**3-3**] returned positive for influenza.
Plan to: - steroid burst - pred 60mg x 5 days (started [**3-2**]) - albuterol nebs PRN - continue outpt advair - continue tamiflu x 5 days (started [**3-3**]) - continue azithro x 5 days (started [**3-2**]) The patient was transferred to the floor with quick improvement of her respiratory status.
# Elevated lactate/AG acidosis:  Pt w/ elevated lactate 3.5 in ED, rechecked, and elevated to 4.5.
Concern for influenza given prior presentations for increased lactate.
Afebrile here.
# Sinus tachycardia:  Initially felt due to possible thyroid storm, maintained on esmolol gtt.
Pt had a stable HR around 90 upon discharge, which has been attributed to her virus and albuterol treatments.
She was chest pain free and without pleuritic pain or shortness of breath/DOE at discharge and will follow up with her PCP regarding this.
# H/O MS:  Not on any meds.
# Depression: Continue effexor.
